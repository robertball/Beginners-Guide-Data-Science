Living with two avid hunters I always have plenty of venison in the freezer.  I personally, do not care much for it, unless however it is cooked in a manner that I do not know what it is! I am not alone in this feeling. My children take my side.  Venison tends to taste "wild" if you do not have a great recipe.  This is a GREAT recipe! We did not tell the kids what it was until after they all had thirds!! They were shocked as was I.  This was a very tasty and easy.  We will make this many time in the future.  Thanks so much! Now maybe I can clean out the freezer!

Delicious! I used a TBLS of minced garlic instead of garlic salt, added 1 1/2c of water, and cubed a couple potatoes, 2 carrots, and 2 celery stalks. For those that said this was too salty - use real garlic instead of the salt (or garlic powder) add a little water, and perhaps using low sodium soy sauce/cream of mushrooms soup would help a bunch as well.  Turned out great for us and w/ my changes, we didn't find it salty! Good luck & happy cooking!

Because of the previous reviews that I read on this recipe.  I added 3 potatoes and 1/2 cup of red wine to lower the salt.  It tasted just like beef bourgignon!! If you don't like wine I would suggest to add the potatoes as they will absorb the salt.  Hope that helps.

This was an excellent dish! I used a vension round roast.  I combined a can of beef broth and about a cup of red wine.  There was alot of liquid so I will cut down on the broth and wine next time.  It did make wonderful 
gravy..I used 4 cloves of minced garlic, no extra salt, potatoes carrots and onion and alot of cracked black pepper.  The roast was very tender and the dish was amazingly delicious!  My husband and I agreed it was the best venison we have ever had!

This was amazing. Of course like others I made a couple small changes. I used 2 venison steaks and 2 tenderloins I had lying around. But I think this would work on any cut of meat. (Next weekend I am trying it with goose!) I boiled 1 cup of elbow macaroni in water w/ some beef bullion. I then added it to the crock-pot about 20 minutes before serving. In the future I will not use the garlic SALT and maybe throw in a cup of sour cream at the end. 

**** My trick to get the GAME  out of  Gamey meats. I  soak the meat overnight in a FoodSaver vacuum sealed container with Milk!  Work every time!

Awesome - and it smelled so good when I walked in the door!  I agree, I could barely tell it was venison.  Even my son - who does not want anything to do with mushrooms loved it!  I made french fries to go with the gravy and he poured the gravy all over his fries and venison!  I will definitely make this again.  One change I would make - I would use reduced sodium soup and garlic powder instead of salt.  The onion soup mix has enough salt in it and I don't feel you need to add more.  I did use liquid aminos since I was out of soy sauce, but there isn't much difference in taste there anyway.

I followed this recipe,that was a mistake.Is it salty,wow!!.I should've read the reviews before making this.I agree with adding water with the soup ,I would also cut the onion soup mix in half at best.It could be a very good recipe,just make some changes to suit your taste.That is unless your able to take the top off a salt shaker and down the thing.

I made this with an elk roast, and it was wonderful! I browned the roast in oil and butter in the pan first, deglazed the pan with some red wine, and added that nice sauce to the crock pot as well. I also added some rosemary. I love how the soup makes its own gravy! This was super good!

This was the best recipe I've found for venison roast.  Having read the reviews, I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and added a soup can of water.  I also used homemade onion soup mix.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and water--wonderful gravy!

I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars as is. Then I followed the directions of a few other reviewers and added some changes of my own and the meal became a 5. I used one can of mushroom and one can of cream of celery soup. I did not add the onion soup mix (way too much salt). In place of the garlic salt, I added three cloves of garlic. I soaked the meat over night in milk. I added a splash of red wine and one cube of beef bouillon. Finally, I added potatoes, carrots and mushrooms to the sauce. I let it cook on low for 8 hours or more and the meat was tender and juicy. I will make this over and over and try it with beef too. I love finding a great slow cooker recipe. They are so easy, and when supper time comes the only work that needs to be done is setting the table.

The dry onion soup mix, along with the sliced onion was a little to strong.  I will use this recipe again, but will sub minced onion for the soup mix.  The meat turned out very tender, and not dry, which is a plus for venison.

AMAZING!! I sliced 2 medium yellow onions, used about 1/3 c of red cat (NY fingerlakes wine, sweet red), 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 T salt (both in place of garlic salt). Also added 4 quartered red potatoes & 4 quartered organic carrots.  I will use this every season!  i've got 5 roasts left and can't wait to do this again--only thing i will do different next time is add more veggies. they were cooked perfect!! ran home and did this in about 10 mintues on a lunch break, came home and it was done! used the new reynolds slow cooker inserts and it was like i had nothing to clean up at the end. :) i am full and can't wait for leftover lunch tomorrow! thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made some minor modifications based on other reviews, the results are quite good!

1 large onion (coarsely chopped), 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce, 3 cloves fresh garlic (finely chopped), 1 tsp. ground black pepper, 1 package dry onion soup mix with 2 cups of water, 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup, 1 lb carrots, 3 medium potatoes (cubed in 1-1/2" chunks). 

Mix all the seasonings, water and soup together. 
Place roast in crock pot, place veggies in on top of the roast. Pour soup and seasoning mixture over veggies. Cover and cook on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. Thicken, if desired with cornstarch, 1 tablespoon added at a time over heat until desired thickness is reached.

Wow!  I just made this recipe and I am THRILLED with the results.  I used 2 cans reduced fat cream of celery soup rather than the mushroom because of family tastes.  I also added 1/2 soup can of water and I sprinkled in about 1 tsp of beef bouillon granules.  I also added carrots and potatoes and omitted the onion soup mix.  As others mentioned, I used the real onions and real garlic.  The gravy was incredible.  I found myself sneaking out some potatoes before it was supper time.  Next time I'll be sure to add more.  This was a roast from a small deer and it was very tender.  (I did soak in milk overnight.)  I will never let my husband tease me for harvesting a small deer again.  This meal makes up for it!

I am an avid hunter and LOVE to cook my venison roasts this way. Every time I make it there is hardly any leftovers. I throw in a couple potatoes and carrots with it, and use minced garlic rather than garlic salt...absolutely delicious!!

I do not like beef roast, but this even with the deer was so good.  I did not even have the onion packet, and I used minced garlic.  But amazing!

This is a great starter recipe.  Taking others' suggestions, I added a cup of red wine and a cup of beef broth.  I didn't think it came out w/ too much liquid -- there was enough to make plenty of gravy.  I also added about 5 red potatoes, a handful of baby carrots, an onion, and some whole mushrooms.  Delicious meal for the week!!

I'm giving only 4 stars due to the changes I made....This was a wonderful "base" recipie that was easy to adjust.  I adjusted as follows:  No Soy or Worchestishire sauces and substitute garlic powder or crushed garlic for the garlic salt.  Salting venison will lead to dry meat.....even from the crock pot.  Next I only used 1/4 to 1/2 of the soup mix (also because of salt content)and substituted cream of celery soup due to a mushroom allergy in the family.  I used this modified recipie to cook two-2.5 lb rump roasts and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD YUMMY!  Moist, tender meat with flavour galore :)  I did have to prepare my vegies (carrots, celery, tatos) in a pot on the stove due to lack of room in the crock pot, but that was fine.  The soup makes a WONDERFUL gravy in the end.  I did thicken it slightly w/ corn starch, but only a tad.  Everyone loved the meal and today THANKSGIVING) I have been elected to attempt it again:)  This time I have a 10lb venison rump roast, so I am doing it in the oven.  I'll let ya know ;)****UPDATE**** The 10lb Runp Roast was.....well let's just say it's TOO BIG a piece of venison!  I was forced to cook it in the oven due to it not fitting in my slow cooker.  I still used this recipe and the gravy was again fantastic.  The roast's flavour was good, but such a large cut of meat requires more cooking time than the moisture could take and it was dry.  So stick with the smaller roasts :)

The flavors were amazing in this so 4 stars for that. I did tweek the recipe slightly.  I let my roast soak in milk overnight to take some of the gamey flavor out.  I added a few more splashes of worcestershire sauce, used minced garlic instead of salt, and a lower sodium mushroom soup.  I also added 1/2 cup of red wine. Unfortunately, after slow cooking for 8 hours the venison was till a little tough for my taste.  My husband and 2yr old daughter gobbled it right up though.  I would recommend slow cooking for atleast 10-12 hours.  My father in law tried this same recipe a few days later but left his roast in the crock for 12 hours.  The meat was incredibly tender and had an awesome flavor.

This was GREAT!!  I was afraid of all the salt everyone was complaining about so I made my own onion soup mix, I used a tenderloin vacume paked in red wine overnight. I rubbed the tenderloin w/season salt peper & olive oil, I used 2 cups of water and a 1/4 cup of red wine. And 6 boiler onions cut in quarters when the tender loin was done I added one 4 oz.can of evaporated milk and the mushroom soup. heated through and it was done!! You can also speed up the time in half by cooking in the oven at 325. My Husband loved it. And NO it didn't taste like wild game. I served it over egg noddles no yokes at that. I served it to a friend to mine who swears she doesn't eat venison she didn't know  the difference. BOY WAS SHE SURPRISED!!! I promise your hole family will love it!!

Wonderful! For a side I made biscuits because there was enough gravy for that as well. I read the reviews and used 1 can of mushroom soup, 1/2 an onion, minced garlic, pepper, and added butter on top. Gravy is delicious and will make again!

I found a great way to use the left over's of this recipe.  Shred up the meat, put on tortila shell, cover generously with sause and Mexican Cheese.  Microwave on high for 25 secs.  Add lettuce tomato and whatever else you may enjoy in a burito.    Wrap and enjoy!  The Mexican Cheese really compliments the flavors of the sauce.

Made this the other day. Followed directions perfectly and it turned out great. One thing I did try was low sodium soy sauce. A little thicker Worcestershire sauce and I marinated the roast in a smokey marinade. I did add 1 1/2 cans of water to the condensed cream of mushroom mix and it was a little runny so next time Im going to add 3/4 can and that will be perfect. Also added the onions, potatoes, and carrots and it was GREAT!!!

Delicious.  I made this several days ago, loved it, and have enjoyed the left-overs too.  The meat is extremely tender.  The only change I made was to use chopped garlic instead of garlic salt.

This was delicious. I laid the roast on the sliced onion, then mixed the other ingredients together and poured over top. I used two cloves of fresh garlic (grated) instead of the garlic salt.

The only thing I did different is 1) I used 3lbs of vennison tenderloin and 2) I added about 2 tablespoons of minced fresh garlic.  You couldn't even tell it was venison, it tasted more like a beef roast.

Added potatoes, carrots, fresh garlic (cloves & scapes instead of garlic salt) and fresh fennel. Delicious - my dinner guests were surprised it was venison.

This was so good! I'm just sad my freezer is out of venison.  I didn't use garlic salt but instead replaced it with 4 cloves of chopped garlic.  I served it with mashed potatos and green beans.  The gravy was amazing with the potatos.  I'll definately pass this on!

This one is great to fool the Mother in Law who thinks all game is distasteful.  I lined the cooker first with a tablespoon of olive oil, seared the venison roast on the grill (cleaned and patted dry - added kosher salt, pepper & onion powder prior to searing 3 min each side).  Placed in cooker, dashed some worcestershire over the roast, added sliced red apple (cored) around roast with 8 garlic cloves (not minced).  Half a can of sodium free beef broth with half a sliced white onion and wa la!  Remove the apples and roast - make a gravy with the juices.  Optional - add carrorts and potatoes an hour before eating.  I've done it with cabbage to and it's wonderful.  Experiment and enjoy!

I made this for us two tonight and I knew that going into it that it would be a bit salty as soy sauce is salty; but adding garlic salt put it over the top. We do love salty though. Next time I will use garlic powder instead. I also will double the cream of mushroom soup and lipton onion soup mix. Add cubed new red skin potatoes, carrots, green beans and mushrooms! Excellent!!!

I thought this was great- my venison roasts always seem to be too dry- but this one wasn't. I did add potatoes and carrots and thought the juice was gravy enough

My husband is always skeptical about me trying new recipes.  But when he tried this, 
he said "this is definitely a keeper."  That says a lot coming from him.  I did
add a step before the crockpot though.  Since deermeat is sometimes dry, I decided
to sear it in bacon fat before cooking.  I don't know if that's what made the difference
but the meat was very moist and juicy.

I may have written a review for this in the past, but I want to post again.  I've made this 4 or 5 times over the last year or 2.  Here is how I make it:  3 pounds of venison, and I usually use the tough cuts, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, half a cup of red cooking wine, a couple T. of Worcestershire sauce, carrots, potatoes with the skins on and mushrooms.  I add a little bit of water for the bottom.  After 6 or 7 hours on low, this comes out so delicious and the meat is so tender, it falls apart.  The soup makes such an awesome gravy.  So many people mentioned that the dry onion soup mix made it too salty.  I say leave it out and everyone adds salt to taste after they've dished it up.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!! The only thing I did differently out of personal preferance was cream of celery instead of the cream of mushroom. After we got done eating my bf told me I better make sure I saved this recipe.

Wonderful flavor, but you do NOT need to add salt.  Four out of five stars because of the salt.  I just used garlic powder.

WOW! So good. I followed some of the other suggestions and soaked the meat in milk over night. I added onion, potatoes, carrots and mushrooms. It was fabulous. I used golden mushroom soup. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for venison.

This is the best recipe I've found for slow cooking tougher cuts of venison.  The Round steaks I used came out so tender and flavorful.  After reading other reviews, I added 1/2 cup red wine and used fresh garlic.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  After 6 hours I removed the meat, onions and mushrooms with a slotted spoon and thickened the gravy with a couple tbsps of flour.  I served it stroganoff style, over egg noodles with sour cream on top.  Simply outstanding, and so easy.  Thank you for the recipe!

I'm not a huge fan of venison but this is a great recipe. Serve over egg noodles for a nice stroganoff type dish. Really quite good and very easy. Be sure to check the temp frequently so it doesn't over cook. We also soaked the venison in water with 1T salt and a little vinegar overnight to take away some of the game flavor.

Wonderful!  Excellent!  My girlfriend still does not know it was venison....and I'm not telling her.  I did try this once before and forgot to leave a rating but I highly recommend this.  I did leave out the soup mix but only because I did not have any on-hand.  I used as another one suggested, one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.  For left-overs the next day I grilled italian bread with swiss cheese and this shredded meat, and EVERYONE loved those also.  Woohoo even better!!!!  Thanks for this wonderul recipe.

This is the most awesome slow cooker recipe. My family and I loved it! The venison was extremely tender and the taste was outstanding! Instead of garlic salt, I put in minced garlic instead. I also put in about 1/3 cup of water just for some extra liquid. Will definitely be making this again!!

Great basic recipe! After reading other posts, used the can of mushroom soup, 1 tsp of worcestershire, 1/2 c red wine, 3/4 can of onion soup (instead of lipton), 1/3 soup can of water, 3 small potatoes, 1 sweet potato, peas and carrots.  Instead of garlic salt, used goya seasoning (which contains salt, garlic powder, cumin). It was REALLY good.  Made fresh bread to go with it and soak up the gravy!

Very Good!!  I did this with steaks and they were so tender and delicious.  We like gravy so I used 2 cans of mushroom soup.  Will make again since my husband just got his deer.

While I'm not a venison fan, I made this for my husband and it smelled GREAT!  I did try one bite of the meat and did not think it was too salty; it has a good flavor to it.  I served it with steamed carrots over egg noodles.  The only change make from the recipe was that I added one soup-can of water.

This is the 3rd and the best slow cooker recipe I've tried with venison roast.  The soup and sliced onion ends up as a tasty gravy that I serve with baked or mashed potatoes.  Good enough for company.

This was a tasty and easy way to cook venison.  I cooked the roast in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours and finished it in the oven for 1 hour.  The gravy that the soup mixes made was very salty.  I'll be making this again for sure...but, next time I'll add water to the dry soup mix to cut down on the saltiness and I'll be sure not to add any additional salt.

This dish was soo good! It doesn't taste like venison one bit.  And trust me I can smell deer a mile away. Extremely moist. I followed the recipe except added 1/2 can of water.  I didnt  add any salt, and no soy sauce. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  The soup mix really is all you need in my opion. I will definitely be cooking this again.

Delish! I added 1 1/2 cans of water, 2 Walla Walla onions and powdered garlic. Not salty at all. Cooked on high 5 hours turned to low for another hour. Fall apart tender and a wonderful gravy. This will be my go to recipe for our venison roasts. Thank you!

After reading the other reviews,I too made modifications. I used 2-3lb. Venison roasts,1 large sweet yellow onion,1tbl. of soy sauce,1tbl. of minced garlic,2tbls of Worcestershire sauce, 2- 10.5 cans of beef consumme', 1 32oz container of beef broth. I  cubed up 4 large potatoes and sliced up a 16oz bag of baby carrots. I cooked it on low from 7am till 6pm. I then pulled out the roasts, potatos and carrots and used 5tbls of cornstarch to thicken my gravy. Put everything back in the crockpot and turned it to warm. Oh yeah,I pulled the onions out too before making the gravy. I  can't  stand them. Saved em for my wife. Turned out Very Good! I'll use this for some of my other Venison.

Great recipe. Easy to prepare. Smells great. I will use less garlic salt and soy sauce next time. Very salty. I also like to add mushrooms and use the Onion and Mushroom soup mix instead of just the onion one. Great over noodles or by itself.

I added water and only put half of the dry soup mix. Very salty, like all the other reviews.... figure out little things to make it less salty, potato's work. I also decided to make a side dish of elbow noodles with beef broth and it was a great pairing with the venison.

Someone gave us some venison and after reading other reviews on this recipe, I thought I'd give it a try.  The roast turned out great and didn't taste "gamey".  The only things I added were a cup of beef broth and some carrots and potatoes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe, although I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted minced garlic for the garlic salt, I added chopped celery, carrots, and potatoes, and I added 1 cup red wine and 1/2 cup water. Next time I will probably add a whole cup water instead of 1/2, because it was borderline salty for my taste. Also will omit the soy sauce to bring down the saltiness. Overall very good, since I have never eaten more than a bite of venison with other recipes, this time I had a full plate! The meat was extremely tender, it just fell apart when you grabbed it with a fork.

My two kids (9 and 10) did not even know the roast was venison, and they have eaten venison before (prepared many different ways).  I had to have my daughter cook it with me the seccond time we made it because she did not believe it was venison.  I added some potatoes and carrots, used cream of celery (because my kids do not like mushrooms), and only used half of the onion soup mix and used 3/8 of a teaspoon of garlic powder not garlic salt (to cut down on the sodium).  You could use two cans of cream of mushroom or cream of celery to have more gravy and then serve over egg noodles.  This is a very good recipe which allows for many different changes.

First time I've had venison and actually enjoyed it.  I didn't havne any cream of mushroom soup, so I thickened up some milk with flour, added the onion soup mix and heated on the stove top for a bit.  I also added canned mushrooms.  Great addition!

I changed this up a little only due to the sodium but it still turned out very good and tender. I did not use the can of cream of mushroom soup. I had to cook mine much longer than stated but it was SO tender and tasty! I have a freezer full of venison to use up and this is one will be used again. This was one of the tastiest venison recipes I've tried from this sight.

I soaked my roast overnight in milk to help tenderize and also I have been told that it makes it less "gamey" tasting.  I omitted the soy and worchestire sauces and added carrots, tators and a can of corn later in cooking and it was a home run!  My husband  loved it!

This is the first review I've ever written on this site.  This recipe was SO good!!  I've only recently began to eat venison (bf is a hunter).  The first recipe I tried was just ok, but this changed my mind about venison.  Bf says its the best he's ever had!!  I too used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and added a few red potatoes.  Next time I will add some mushrooms and carrots.  This is a new staple recipe in our house. Thanks!!

I made this yesterday for my boyfriend, who loves venison, and he said it was the best venison recipe he's ever tasted! I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I omitted that and switched garlic powder for garlic salt and just added a few mushrooms in with the onions. I made mashed potatoes to go with the gravy. I'll definitely be getting a lot of requests for this, thanks for the great recipe!

I first made this for a venison roast I had. I did not care for the venison, but loved this recipe! I have since used it many times for pork roast with some very slight changes. Used low sodium cr. of mushroom soup and soy sauce. I sprinkle black pepper and crushed rosemary on the meat, brown it, deglaze the pan with a little red wine, then pour all that in too.  The gravy is a good consistency. Normally slow cooker meals make very watery gravy.  This is a great recipe and so easy!!

Very nice recipe, I marinate the roast in one cup white vinegar and enough water to cover plus one tbs salt overnite. This will remove the gamey taste unless thats what you like.

This was very yummy and fall-apart moist.  I added some carrots, onions and potatoes.  I have been cooking venison roast for, close to, 30 years and am so glad to have a reliable recipe.

Absolutely delicious meal!  This was my first slow cooker meal, cooked in my boyfriend's 6 qt. slow cook.  I cooked two 2 lb venison roasts.  Followed the recipe with a few alterations: used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt and added 2 cups of water.  In retrospect, would have tasted great with only 1 cup added water.  I also tossed in carrots.  Ended up cooking on high for about 8 hours.  The meat was more than done and wonderfully tender.  No knives required!  Plan to make this meal over and over again.

This was AWESOME!  I made it for my mom, Dad, children (3 under 5), husband and sister-in-law, and they all thought it was the best roast they ever had.   The next day for dinner, I shredded the meat and poured gravy over rice as someone had suggested, and that alone was just amazing!  I did add a cup 1/2 of water AND low sodium soy sauce.  I also used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Then, I doubled the recipe to make enough for all 8 of us with leftovers.

The family was disappointed in this dish.  It was extremely salty so if I make it again, I would use fresh garlic and not garlic salt.

I really don't care too much for venison but after making this recipe for my husband I love it. My husbands friends at work now beg me to make this recipe anytime we have a venison roast.

It's rare for me to come across a slow cooker recipe that's actually as good as it says it is. THIS ONE IS IT! It turned out perfect and I'm no gourmet cooker. The venison was so tender and just melted in my mouth. This is one of my fiance's favorite meals.

We served this with Christmas dinner.  Even though everyone was stuffed with the main course (goose), everyone still raved about the venison.  The only change was I had to leave out the Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any.

Review update: Christmas 2006, I made this again, but found it very salty.  I was confused as to why, but then realised that ironically, I used a better cut of meat.  It was also farmed, rather than hunted venison.  So, there was less fat and less liquid (in the form of added water) to dilute the salty seasonings.

So, while I still think this is a good recipe, in future I will be careful to ensure there is enough liquid to dilute the salt.  Also, because I personally don't like a lot of salt, I would probably not use garlic salt again - instead either fresh garlic or garlic powder.

This recipe is an outstanding way to prepare the lean roasts!! I added 2 cans of water (wanted to make lots of gravy), some potatoes, and had some extra ground venison (about 1/2 lb) and leftover bacon (about 5 pieces) to use up so I added that as well. What a great one dish meal--I can hardly wait to have my dad (the hunter) over for dinner to show it off!  Loved it--Thank you!

With 5 out of 6 family members hunting, I'm always looking for new game recipes. This one was a huge hit! Family loved it, and I love crock pot recipes:) I added two cans of cream mush soup, minced garlic (less garlic salt), a bit of water,  and a packet of onion gravy mix. Threw in some potatoes and the fam inhaled it. Will definitely make again!

Yummy! This was so good! The venison was crazy tender and the gravy broth just delicious! I doubled the gravy broth ingredients and therefore used a tablespoon of garlic salt and a tablespoon of garlic powder as others said the garlic salt could be too strong. I added potatoes and carrots which were fantastic. I also added mushrooms the last hour of cooking also yummy. I cooked mine on high for 5 hours and low for one more hour.  Again the meat was super tender, not gamey at all and not at all salty. Beer bread made an excellent pairing to sop up the excess gravy. I'm definitely making this again!!!! Thank you!

this is actually the same recipe i used for my beef pot roast. It is fantastic and the juice from it makes an amazing gravy for potatoes after it is done cooking.

I was hoping it wouldnt taste gamey, and it didnt! I used granulated garlic instead of the garlic salt, 1/2pkg of onion soup mix mixed with 1/2C red wine and the cream of mushroom soup and the rest of ingredients. I like to add sprinkle of herbs de province before the layer of onion. It is fabulous! Stir in 1/2 C sour cream to the gravy before serving

We really loved this recipe! I had never made venison before (or even eaten it I don't think) so we loved the recipe! Followed it to a T and it was great! Check out the review on my blog! http://heatskitchen.blogspot.com/2013/02/venison-roast.html

My father ages his venison in ice water for near so many days-he just keeps adding more ice and draining off the bloody water. Then they package and freeze for 3 months without using meat.I've been blessed to not have to taste gamey venison. This is how we cook our venison roast in our family.

My family ate every bite of this recipe tonight. I used Backstrap cutlets because that's what I had defrosted. My only substitution was a package of brown gravy mix for the French onion soup mix. I didn't have any of the soup mix and in my opinion they taste very similar. I'll definitely make this again.

Great recipe! Mine turned out more like pulled venison. It was so tender it just shredded apart as I tried to cut medallions, so I went with it. I pulled it and served over rice. It was excellent. The only change I made was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt. It doesn't need any more salt...there's plenty from the onion soup mix. I will definitely add this to my rotation of venison meals! Thanks for sharing.

Ok I'm not sure how this turns out with venison. My fiancé used regular beef sirloin tip roast, and he followed the rest of the recipe exactly. While it was "stewing" it smelled awesome... After a couple hours it smelled less awesome... And by the time we went to eat it, the roast smelled identical to grandpa's feet. I'm not talking regular smelly grandpa feet, I'm talking downright bad! I'm sitting here with all the windows open and trying to get the taste out of my mouth by licking steel wool. It got one star because the beef did turn out somewhat tender and if you scraped the sauce off, you could almost eat it.

DELICIOUS!!!! I have made this at least 3 times and it's always a hit. The first time I tried it I served it to a group of friends doing work on my house. They all went nuts over it.  This recipe is SUPER easy and absolutely delicious. Even my mother who hates venison loves this recipe!

Very tasty and definately makes it less gamey tasting.  I opted for a low-sodium option using Herb-ox no sodium beef broth instead of the onion and mushroom soups, and sauted an onion and mushrooms for flavor.  Also used low sodium soy sauce.

Here are my tweaks. I poured a capful of cider vinegar over the meat first to help with the gaminess. Substituted a pinch of granulated garlic for the garlic salt. Left out the soy sauce. Added half a soup can of water. It's almost like stroganoff. Next time I will add sour cream as well. Awesome recipe, thanks!

It was great! Will use this recipe a lot. The only thing I will do next time is to cut the roast into lets say 3x3 inch pieces. This will let the sauce mingle with the meat.

This is an excellent option for venison. Great to start in the morning and even better to come home to later on! Makes the house smell amazing! This is an easy recipe to tweak too depending on your preference in seasoning and you can even add veggies as others have. I've used tougher cuts of venison with this recipe also with great results. Highly recommended!

So easy to make. Marinated in milk overnight. Added 10 cloves of garlic and a cup of red wine to the slow cooker. Wife and kids went nuts for this. They are not big venison fans and they loved it.

Very good! I used Tawney Port instead of red cooking wine, a can of beef broth and a additional 1/2 bag of onion soup seasoning. Added Red skinned potatoes and carrots.When it was done I added 1/4 cup of corn starch/water mix to thicken. Turned out fantastic!!

I used two venison roasts that weighed just over 1.5 lbs. each. There was not a bit of fat on these roasts so they were a little dry. I followed the recipe, except I cut down the dry onion soup to half the package (per other reviewers suggestions). The end result was delish. And the gravy was outstanding. I have more venison roasts to cook in the future and this recipe will be the go to prep. Thanks for the recipe.

This venison recipe is great!  I did make a few changes based on our personal tastes and a lower sodium diet.  I used 1 T. less sodium soy sauce, 1 T. Worchestershire, 1 T. granulated garlic, 1 t. fresh black pepper, 2 packages Lipton onion soup mix and 2 cans less sodium cream of mushroom soup.  I also add 2 onions, sliced, 4 carrots, sliced and 4 red potatoes, cubed.  Cook on low crockpot 8 hours.  We ate this for dinner with crusty bread for 3 nights!  Makes a lot, enjoy!

My favorite way to use all the deer roasts in my freezer.  No game taste, great on potato or rice or in sandwiches.  We make this least every 2 weeks during hunting season!

This recipe was simply amazing!  I did everything the recipe said and it turned out very tasteful!  I did have a 2 pound venison roast and 1 pound of steaks...that was the only thing different.

OMG!  Yes if you must have deer for dinner this is the recipe.  It was really good.  The only thing different that I did, was I added fresh mushrooms in with it and when it was done I put some sour cream and mixed it in. (also have some on the table if you want more sour cream) and then I put it over egg noodles!  Very yummy, and I forgot that I was eating "Bambi".  :)

Very good!  Mine did not turn out dry at all.  I stuck it in a small roaster pan and stuck in the oven at 350 for 1.5 hours. Then took meat out and made the sauce into a thick gravy on the stove with cornstarch.  Add homemade rolls and potatoes...YUMMY!!!  Very good the next day on a sandwich.

This is a great recipe.  I used a dry veggie soup mix.  My husband loves venison but never would eat a venison roast (to dry).  He loved it and was better as leftovers.  Thank you for this recipe - we will make it again.

Lets start off by saying, I don't care for venison at all.  With two hunters in the house, we have a freezer full... so I need to use it.  This recipe was AWESOME!  did not taste like venison at all! I added a can of water and used minced garlic.  Thanks!  will definitely make this one again.

I followed some of the suggestions - added red wine, used real garlic, 3 tabledspoons, and left out the soy sauce.  I used deer stew meat (2 packages, added carrots, and quartered fresh mushrooms.  It was delicious!  Add some corn muffins for a really good combination!

Great!  The only thing I did different was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt and a half soup can of water.  Next time, I will use less water.  I did not find this recipe too salty as some people did.  Will definitely cook this again!

This was my first time making venison on my own and my husband loved it!!!! The meat was fork tender and literally melted in our mouths. I did change a few things in the recipe; minced garlic for garlic salt, no soy sauce and let it cook for 7 hours on low.

I'm really glad I read the reviews before making this.  Based on that, I made some modifications: I used Healthy Request soup (2 cans; I like a lot of gravy), 1 TEASPOON each of the Worcestershire and soy sauces, garlic POWDER and only 1/2 package of the onion soup mix.  For my taste, it was still too salty.  I browned my roast, before I put it in the slow cooker. I also added carrots, potatoes and celery. I honestly don't think I could have eaten this, had I not tried to cut back on the salt in the recipe. When I try this again, I think I will use EITHER the sauces OR  the soup mix, but not both.  This had a good flavor, and my roast came out very tender--it actually shredded when I tried to cut it.  However, I'm giving this only 4 stars, because there's no way I could fathom this as originally written, with all that salt.

Tried this the other day, an of course ommited any salt. My kids just ate it up quick, they had no idea it was deer meat. My wife could tell the ever so slight difference between a deer and beef but thought it tasted pretty much the same except more tender. EXCELLENT RECIPE.

This was very tasty. My husband and I both really liked it...best with mashed potatoes. I added water and an extra can of soup because I used more than 3 lbs. of meat. Definately do not add salt to this recipe.

a little salty but i think I put a little too much garlic salt, and the soup mix was probably salty, but overall it tasted very good...would definitely use cubed meat as opposed to boned meat as it was more tender...was wondering what red wine might do for it

This is a good basis. I used the soup and soup mix combo mixed with a cup of red wine and a cup of beef stock. I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and added baby carrots celery and mushrooms to the slow cooker. The most important steps precede the slow cooker. I soaked the venison in milk for 24 hours (to reduce the gaminess) then seasoned and floured it and browned it in s frying pan to seal in the juices.

I added quartered potatoes, carrots and celery. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Cooked on high for 4 hours. I removed the potatoes and mashed them with butter. Served it with the gravy on everything! Rated it a 4 because I don't like deer meat and I could still slightly taste the game but I think this is the closest I have come to enjoying it!

Best venison recipe I have ever tried!!!   I read the review and eliminated the soya sauce and added a dash (or 3) of red wine near the end.   It didn't taste gamey at all....    if you didn't know you would think its beef.  It was even better the next day!

I was pressed for time so I modified slightly: I cubed my roast and set the slow-cooker on high for 4 hrs. Put over brown and wild rice. This was tremendous.

The reviews are totally right, it does not have a gamey flavor at all! I added all elements to this recipe that were stated (applying soy sauce and worstershire more liberally) and also added potatoes, baby carrots, chopped celery and fresh mushrooms! Definitely making this again in the future!

My family loved this and my kids (3 teenagers) didn't realize it was venison until after they were raving about how good it was.  I made a couple of modifications.  
I sauteed a whole yellow onion and two fresh garlic cloves in olive oil and put that into the crock pot as the bottom layer.  I then browned the roast in the remaining oil in the frying pan and put the browned roast into the crock pot.  I didn't have any soy sauce , Worcestershire, or onion soup pkg. so I used one can of mushroom soup, one can of cream of celery,  one can of water, 1 tbs of onion salt, and 2 tbs of fresh ground pepper.  It was not too salty at all and no one added any salt or pepper to flavor the meal as it was so full of flavor. The meat just fell apart it was so tender and there was no "gamey" taste.  My husband said it was the best deer he had ever had.  :)

I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I used 2tbsp extra low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 tsp sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon tabasco sauce as a replacement. Then I didn't have Lipton onion soup mix to make things more complicated lol. To replace the onion soup mix I made my own: 1/3 Cup dried onion flakes, 1 1/2 - 2 Tbsp beef bouillon granules, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp celery seed, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1/8 tsp turmeric. I also threw in some potatoes and carrots on top of the onions, and mixed a little milk in with the soup and spices. Getting a good char on the meat before you put it in there really helps with the flavor and gets rid of the gamy taste. Left it overnight to cook, and MAN IT WAS WORTH IT! I don't think I've ever had deer this good before :)

I did not care for this recipe. I usually cook from scratch, and now I remember why.  I saw mention that it was salty in a review, but I like salt. Wasn't ready for this though! The soup and mix, the soy, the Worcester, and ESPECIALLY the garlic salt add up. I think with real garlic, mushrooms, etc. it would be excellent though. Next time...

Unless you LOVE a TON of salt- I strongly recommend NOT following this recipe to a T. Judging by other reviews adding some potatoes and substituting the garlic salt for garlic powder may have saved it. Aside from being too salty this really is a good recipe- I just think this site needs to modify it a bit like so many others who have made this dish have.  The meat turns out great and the flavor is there but just masked with SO MUCH salt. I will make this again but only with the modifications I stated.

Absolutely loved it!  I did add beef broth, thick sliced mushroom, and potatoes to it.  I seasoned the vension before I put it in the slow cooker and I didn't and the dry onion soup mix I was worried it would be to salty. I made biscuits to go with it.  Awesome!

This recipe was a hit.  I changed the tablespoon of garlic salt to a tbs. of minced garlic.  I also soaked the venison overnight in milk.  Everyone loved it.

slow cooked it for 5 hours in the crock pot turned out great but instead of using a pre-mixed onion soup mix i made my own all it takes is onion powder, onion flakes, bouillion beef and black pepper i think this makes the taste much better.

Very good, took others advice and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  I had gotten the roast from a friend and didn't know what is was. didn't know if i should cook til fell apart or slice.  Cooked 6 hours and sliced thin, was perfect.

OMG!!! Super tender and flavorful!! I accidentally put tablespoons instead of teaspoons of  the soy and worcestershire, but it was still fantastic! My fiancee doesn't care for roast at all, but he LOVED this one. I also couldn't start my 2.5 lb roast 6 hours early, so I cooked mine on high for 4 hours, but it was still awesome!! This recipe is definately a keeper!

This was soooo good and easy.  I did take the advise of other reviewers.  I added 1/2 cup of red wine and didn't add the garlic salt as it would've been too salty and used minced garlic about 2 cloves and some potatoes and carrots and 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end.  Will definitely make again!

I used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Roast was excellent.  It still tasted like venison to me but was very moist and tender.  We really enjoyed this meal and will make it again.  I am giving four stars because it did not seem to have enough liquid for the crockpot.  So, I added the roast and then enough water so it was at least half full and would not dry out during cooking process.

I'm not a hunter so I do not know about cooking wild things. I looked at this recipe, thought it would be good, might be heavy on the onion with the soup and the slices of onion. This was great! But heavy on the onion!. I would leave out the sliced onion, maybe use veggies or potatoes.

Very well recieved just thought a bit too much salt, used fresh garlic and omitted onion soup, next time might use oion soup instead of fresh onion, as they didn't seem to cook too well.

I made this recipe on Saturday. It was every easy. Already had everything on hand. I threw it in the crock pot, let it cook for about 6 hours, added a can of sliced mushrooms. Cooked another hour and served with rice. Great! I will add this to my list of favorites. Thanks for sharing.

This is an Awsome Recipe. I've been looking for new ways to cook venison. This one is great! I did add 1cup water and changed the garlic salt to garlic powder plus used low sodium soy sauce.I had to cook it a little longer to, but that was just cause my roast was still a little frozen in the middle. My family Loved this recipe! Even my very picky husband!

First time cooking venison and this recipe was easy.  I did not use garlic salt, used fresh garlic instead and Campbell's Healthy Request soup.  I also added potatoes, carrots, celery, and canned but drained mushrooms to the recipe.  I still think it was too salty.  The gravy was delicious and the meat was tender but too much salt for me.

Well, I sort of complety changed this but not on purpose.  I thawed out what I thought was "chuck" roast but instead it was "chunks" of venison.  So I mixed some flour with cayenne, garlic pwd, blk pepper, and oregano an tossed the chunks of venison in it to coat.  Then browned on two sides in a hot pan of butter.  I took previous reviewers ideas and deglazed the pan with some red wine. Added some fresh mushrooms, potatoes and carrots to the crockpot and it turned out wonderfully.  I suppose my version is a little more of a hunter's stew though.

WOW!! This was my first time I had venison let alone cook it and it was really good.  My hunter husband loved it and I will be making this recipe again that's for sure...I took a few suggestions from the other reviewers such as adding cream of celery instead of mushroom, used garlic powder, and only 1/2 package of onion soup mix. The roast was very moist and tender and it didn't have any "gamey" taste to it... Thanks alot for the recipe Sara :o)
Any more...I only have about 50 more pounds of venison in my freezer.. hee hee

Excellent way to use venison.  I cubed the meat to make a sort of stew.  Also added mushrooms and sour cream as suggested by other reviewers.  Good served over noodles.  It is quite salty though, so you might want to omit the soy sauce.

Great and easy recipe!  Mine could have cooked a  little longer as it was not as tender as I was hoping.  After reading the reviews, I also substituted minced garlic for the garlic salt and added a half cup of red wine.  The whole thing was awesome over rice.  I might put the whole thing back in the crock for 1.5 hours on high tonight and see if it tenders up any.  (Not sure what part of deer I'm dealing with - it was a gift from a friend's hunting husband and she had no details).

I used venison steaks for this recipe and they turned out wonderful.  There was no "gamey" taste and the meat just fell apart, it was so tender.  It was great served over rice.  I would definitly make this again.

I have been using this recipe for years. I use it for roast from any animal. We absolutely love it and every guest that has ever tried it at my house agrees that it is delicious. The only thing I do that is not listed in the recipe is add vegetables.  I quarter an onion, cut carrots to a length of about 3" and add any potato I have laying around cut into quarters. I add all of this to the slow cooker so my sides are already  done with the meat is cooked. The juices from the meat give the vegetables a fantastic flavor. When adding the vegetables I add enough to feed however many people will be sitting at my table that night. I usually put the vegetables under the roast so when the juice drip off the roast it fully coats the veggies.

I put three roasts in instapot a d slow cooked on low for about ten hours and the on keep warm until morning. I tripled the recipe as best I could. I used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken. I didn't have dry onion mix but had a packet of a dip that you buy at art fairs that appeared to be similar. The gravy is very nice. Packaged it up in four separate containers for freezer for future meals. (someone left the freezer door open so had to cook a lot of meat)

This review is for me to refer to to see what works and doesn't for next time I want to make it.  Those that get mad for not following the recipe need not read this one.

Made this following the recipe exactly and was surprisingly wowed! I actually did not find this to be too salty. Forms a tasty gravy that even thickens all on its own. I piled potatoes and carrots on top so that they wouldn’t get to overcooked. I was VERY surprised at how moist this stayed. That’s  rare for venison since it is lacking fat. It’s a keeper

I've made this twice.  I liked it enough to eat it for an entire week (with adaptations). Definitely take the advice of others to reduce the salt. I recommend low  sodium condensed mushroom soup.  I'm looking to elevate this recipe with an additional flavour/spice. This is a great starter recipe though.

Easy to follow recipe with really really good results!  I only remember cooking venison for my husband one other time and it didn't turn out nearly this good. A few ingredients make this crock pot ready in minimal time, and the taste is suble and delicious!

I made this but changed the broth. I added 2 cups of red wine and 7 cups of water.  It was great. However,  next time, I may cut down the wine by half cup.

Not bad.  Went off everyone’s suggestions about the salt. Used garlic powder, a splash of soy sauce, mixed water into the soups and cubes up potatoes and threw around the roast while it cooked. It definitely did not have a strong salt flavor. However, the sauce did not go well with the venison roast but it didn’t make the potatoes taste good.

I did not change anything , other than doubling the pepper.  Next time, I'd add 2 cups of rinsed white rice, another can of soup, a cup of beef broth and 3T cooking sherry.  Very good flavor.

Shoe leather. Whoever said to cook it for six hours needs to explain how they keep it from getting so tough as to be inedible. I had to throw out two perfectly good sirloin roasts. Smelled good, though. Identify the internal temperature it should reach. Time in crockpot or oven are meaningless when compared with internal temperature as an indicator of doneness.

I would make this again, but I should have read the reviews beforehand.  This was a salt lick and my family uses a lot of salt. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (and only half of what was called for), used a little red wine mixed with the soup mixture,  but it was still too salty.  I added carrots and celery with the onions, served over mashed potatoes.  It would have been pretty boring without the added vegetables and I think next time I would add mushrooms as well.

Since the previous reviews said it was very salty, I skipped the garlic salt and used garlic powder instead. Delicious!

This is very good, but was way too salty. I won’t be adding the tablespoon of garlic salt next time. You don’t need it if using a whole pack of onion soup mix.

This was tasty and easy. I used small gold potatoes. I will just use more veggies next time because despite using the size roast requested we ran out of veggies before we did roast.

The venison was tender and not at all gamey.  I added potatoes to the recipe and skipped the cream soup as I needed to keep it dairy free.  I used a bit of flour to thicken  the juices in a separate pan then added that back to the stew.  So, not quite the same recipe, but it was very good!

I read some of the reviews first and followed the recipe with some adjustments. Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder. I also added about a cup of California red wine. AMAZING. It still tastes like venison but in such a comforting way. I will not try any other recipe. There are no leftovers tonight!!!

I added water to mine and threw in carrots and taters, I had already marinated mine with some Beef Stubbs marinade.  The cream of mushroom and onion mix was great and one that I would not have tried till I read your recipe.  Thank you Sal.

I wasn't sure how to rate this recipe because I think it needs some tweaking as written, but it deserves five stars with those tweaks.  First, I cut back on the amount of fresh onion since the recipe also calls for onion soup mix.  One large onion is equivalent to 1-1/2 c. chopped, but I used about 1/2 c.  Second, as mentioned by several other reviewers, 1 T soy sauce + 1 T. garlic salt + 1 package of onion soup mix = way too much salt.  I substituted a couple teaspoons of minced garlic for the garlic salt.  Third, I added vegetables (baby potatoes, carrots, and celery) and liquid (1 c. broth + 1/2 c. red wine).  Then, near the end of the cooking time, I added a slurry of potato starch and milk and turned the heat to high to thicken the stew before serving.  We enjoyed it over rice.

Basic, but good. Maybe a little salty for how we try to eat, but that's to be expected from the soup mix.

Great recipe. I added about a cup of diced tomatoes and a tsp or so of real garlic instead of garlic salt. The sauce works well with white rice as a side.

It's still cooking so I'll be back to finish the review, however I added 1 pound of carrots, 2 large baking potatoes, 1/3 cup red wine, 1/3 cup basalmic vinegar, and 1/3 cup water.  Thought it was a bit dry on its own as written. 

We will see!  Very much looking forward to seeing how he turns out!  

Great super easy receipe.

Excellent dish! I did make a few changes (naturally!) as I did not have the packet onion soup mix so substituted onion/garlic salt and herbs. I also sloshed browned the meat first and then deglazed the pan with some red wine.

With the exception of using homemade cream of mushroom soup I followed this recipe exactly. My venison would easily pass for lean beef as it had no detectable games taste. Fantastic recipe!

Outstanding recipe.  Made this along with a turkey for Thanksgiving.  Everybody loved it.  Made it with an Elk roast.  Very tender and tasty.  Used fresh minced garlic instead of the salt.

I think this was a great, fast and easy recipe. Although we are not a family that uses salt...at all. So I have had onion soup before...so with the onion soup and mushroom soup I thought that was enough sodium. So I did not use garlic salt instead opted for just garlic powder. I also added a little salt free steak seasoning. But overall a great recipe!!

Used venison but I would make this with any beef roast tool  Very good!!  The gravy was dark and very tasty.  New favorite over just the Onion soup package and the Cream of Onion soup can.  The extra ingredients really bummed it up a notch.  New favorite for sure!  Thanks

This was my first time cooking with venison so I was a little nervous but it turned out great!! Super easy too. Did tweak the recipe slightly. Left out the soy sauce, added a little beef broth, carrots, peas, red potatoes, and some flour in the last 30 mins of cooking to thicken it. Served with biscuits. SO good! Will definitely make again.

This was my first time cooking venison and I was very nervous about - but it turned out great! Yes, it was a little bit salty for my liking, but it was still yummy! Next time I'll cut back on the dry soup mix. I poured some of the "gravy" over mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Also did the 1-1/2 cups extra water with the onion soup mix to reduce salt and it turned out amazing. also added carrots, peas, Potatos chopped up with skin on, corn, celery, Lima beans and green beans and it comes out WoW!!! Highly recommend to cook this.

Followed the advice of others: halved the onion soup mix, used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. I did add 1 1/2C low sodium beef broth, potatoes, & carrots since I was working with venison cubes. This made a real good stew!

This is a great recipe to use up the venison in my freezer! Followed the recipe then added cut up red potatos and one soup can of water as others suggested. It was delicious and the meat just falls apart. My boyfriend loves any recipe with venison in the crockpot, but this one I took seconds as well! Only gave 4 stars because I had to make the slight adjustments.

I read a few reviews and took the advice of several. I soaked my roasts overnight in milk.  I used minced garlic rather than garlic salt and added potatoes, carrots, celery and1/2 cup red wine.  It was absolutely delicious! Everyone enjoyed it and agreed it tasted every bit as good as beef without the fat. Definitely will make it again.

I made this with my husband's venison, and followed the recipe exactly as it's written (but added carrots and potatoes). After 9 hours of it cooking I lifted the lid and was really grossed out by the smell of it (it must have been the mushroom soup?) I tried a little and did not like it (I guess I'm just not into venison like many women). My husband loved it though so I suppose I'll give it 4 stars!

This recipe is delicious. I do advise to add water or use low sodium ingredients. My husband is also an avid hunter and he said that this was the best venison(deer) roast he has ever had!! Happy eating!!

We eat a lot of venison at our house so when my husband said that this was the best roast he had ever had that meant something!  I did not have the onion soup mix and it was great with out it.  It made a very tasty gravy.

Very good.  No gammey taste to the meat,  The only change I did was used Garlic powder instead of Garlic salt (because of the salty comments)  and with this change we had no issues with it being too salty.

Served the roast over Mashed potatoes covered in the gravy and it was a very good dinner.  Meat was tender and delicious,  will make this again.

I have never enjoyed the taste of wild game because of the ... well, the wild game taste. But my husband is an avid hunter so what's a girl to do?
This recipe is excellent! I've made it twice now, once just for us to try it out & the 2nd time for company. One of my guests said it was the best dish I had ever made.
I followed the recipe as written the 1st time except that I floured & browned the meat on all sides in bacon fat then browned onion & minced garlic in it as well. I deglazed the pan with a sweet red wine & added that to the other ingredients.  Also added baby carrots & potatoes. Edit - cooked roast with soups 6 hrs turned, added veggies & cooked another 6 hrs.
I don't remember how long I cooked this in the slow cooked but I think it was for at least 8 hrs because we were out of the house. It was so good that my husband & I could not stop eating! It was a bit salty so next time I think I'll use garlic powder rather than garlic salt.
The 2nd time, I just plain forgot to add the Worcestershire & soy sauces. I did use garlic powder instead of salt & I was glad I did. This is the dish I served to company, I added a packet of Swanson's beef flavor boost. I doubled the recipe because I wanted to freeze some & give some to my brother. I was able to give some to my brother - barely! But our guests devoured this! 
I have a freezer full of venison roast so I will be making this again & again!

Made this recipe tonight for dinner. I found it to be very tasty, but extremely salty! I did not have venison roast, so I used two venison steaks and they came out so tender that we did not need knives to cut them. This recipe was enjoyable, but like I said before, salty. It was very flavorful, but the ingredients (like the soy sauce and worcestershire sauce) are salty on their own, as was the onion soup mix. I believe cutting the garlic salt in half would probably be a good idea for this recipe.

Pretty good- the venison tasted exactly like beef and had no gamey flavor whatsoever.  Definitely use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and low sodium soup.  I did not add any potatoes and didn't think it was salty at all.

I have made this recipe a couple times for parties at our house, and people love it.  This past time, I added 1 can of whole berry cranberry sauce to the recipe.  I stirred it with the soups.  It gave the recipe a "french" flavor---as if I had added a bunch of reduced red, fruity wine.  Excellent.  I made no other changes, other than to brown two smallish roasts first.  I did cut the roasts into very large chunks to allow them to fit into the crock pot with ease.

I am new to cooking wild game and I really enjoyed this recipe! Didn't taste wild at all. I used deer steaks instead and I thought it was a little too salty. Next time I will add garlic power instead of garlic salt. It was still good though, delicious served over mashed potatoes!

I used 2 cloves fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added 1/4 teaspoon basil and 1/4 teaspoon oregano. Instead of using mushroom soup, I had to get by with 2 cups of water. Definitely not as rich, but still good.

This recipe was delicious.  I did not have garlic salt so I added minced garlic instead.  Everyone loved it!!!  There was a lot of gravy at the end.  Next time I would most likely add potatoes and carrots to it as well.

I'll be honest I didn't eat any of this, but I am passing along the comments. To help with the salt we cut down on the soup mix and used the low sodium canned soup. We also added water and two chopped celery stalks. My husband loved it. Since I had to sleep with him for the next two days, I would probably cut out the dry onion mix altogether. He and the house stunk so bad of onions it made me positivly ill. Taste wise it was a hit.

I didn't care for this very much because the meat came out very dry. The flavor was ok, but I did add some red wine to the crock pot. My husband and friends said it was pretty good though. Guess I'm just really picky about how dry my meat is!

I couldn't brave the meal but the boys sure liked it! I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup, one can of water, half a packet of onion soup and put in potatos, celery, and carrots. It turned out really soft. I don't know if it's just the meat or if it cooked too long. Thanks for the recipe! I would have been clueless!

Very good!  The meat was nice and juicy.  My only complaint was how salty it was.  It really wasn't that bad, but it was pushing too much.  I did follow the suggestions of other cooks' comments, and added one can of water.  I also added a bit of flour to thicken up the gravy, which solved that problem.  I also added mushrooms and carrots, which I thought, really completed the meal.  Overall, this was a success!

This is a delicious way to cook a venison roast, but there has to be a way to make it more moist. I just can't figure it out. It's such a lean meat, it always feels dry to me. I don't blame that on the recipe so much as the animal. I can't wait to try this with a beef roast.

We really enjoyed this recipe...followed some others' suggestions to reduce the saltiness and it helped, the end product was great.  I did make a few changes...used Beefy Mushroom condensed soup in place of the Onion soup mix (we don't care for it) so there was much more sauce than there should have been.  Used a little cornstarch/cold water to thicken it up, added a little sour cream and served it with the venison over egg noodles as a stroganoff.  Will definitely save this recipe.

Good enough. Nice sauce (maybe try w/beef) as venison still tasted a tiny bit gamey.

Great tasting results. I used red potatoes, minced garlic (instead of salt) and cooked it overnight in slow cooker. Served in crusty bread bowls.

Absolutely excellent, I followed the recipe, but leary of the complaints of too salty, I used mince, garlic added a couple cerlary stalks, a frozen bag of of peas and carrots, a package of sliced portobellas, a big can of diced white potatoes, a cup of red cheap house wine and wow, after 7 hours, not salty at all, nor gamey or stringy, and sooooo soft yum yum!!

This is awesome. I used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt and golden mushroom soup in place of the cream of mushroom. My family cans some of the venison each year so I occationally substitute that meat and pour it over egg noodles.

I was really disappointed with this recipe - after reading all the rave reviews I was excited to try this out on my 'hunter' husband. We cook with venison and elk quite a bit. It was easy to prepare, but after cooking so long - I think it ruined a perfectly good cut of meat. The sauce was not that great either. We both love venison and elk - might be a good use for stew meat - but not a good roast (unless you are trying to completely mask the flavor of the meat?). sorry!

I give this 5 stars because of the ease of preparation along with a very good taste.  I like to add potatoes around the roast, topped with baby carrots and then covered with sliced onions!

This is absolutely delicious. I served it at a New Year's Eve party and it was a hit! I can't believe how easy it was to make. Very moist and tender too.

My husband loved this recipe and wished he could eat the whole thing in one sitting. The gravy it makes he ate over rice and couldn't put it down.

This was a really great recipe! I used venison backstrap. It was very simple to prepare, just throw everything into the crockpot and let it cook for the day! Everyone loved it! I will definately be making this again!

I don't normally like the taste of venison, but thought that I would give this a try...I am soooo glad that I did!!  What a wonderful recipe!  You wouldn't even know what it was!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't find it salty at all.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!!!

This recipe was awesome! Easy to make and tasted great. I omitted the soy sauce as that is not a family favorite.

Very tender and had a great flavor. Next time I might not put the soy sauce in but I don't know if that affects the gamey flavor. This did not have a gamey flavor when cooked just like the recipe.

This was such an easy way to cook a venison roast, but it was so delicious, too!  The meat was so tender, and just about fell apart.  I made this for my entire family, and really impressed everyone!  Thanks.
