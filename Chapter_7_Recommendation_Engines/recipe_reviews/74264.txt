Great Recipie.  Didn't have any pineapple, but found it just perfect (sweetness) because it already had 2 tbsp. of sugar.  I think both would be too much, but will try it with the pineapple next time.  Stir-fried the garlic, ginger and 1/2 c. sliced onion briefly before adding the chicked and found it gave it great flavour.  Also added 1 tbsp. cornstarch & 1 tbsp. cold water (mixed) to the soya mixture.

Easy and fabulous!  I doubled the sauce, used a larger can of pineapple, thickened it a bit with cornstarch, and used fresh vegetables.  This will be served frequently at our house.  Excellent over chow mein noodles.

Very very good and easy too! I had some leftover stir-fry marinade so I let the chicken sit in that for an hour or so in the fridge. I don't have access to the Mann's veggies so I just used what we like...broccoli, snow peas, onions and red pepper slices. Other than that I followed to the T. We all enjoyed it, kind of a sweet and sour effect. Will make this one again, yummy!

Wow! This was a great stir fry!! We didn't use Mann's California Stir Fry, however; we just added fresh veggies from the garden--broccoli, carrots, red onion, a little celery, zucchini, and summer squash. We also used red wine vinegar, a little extra pineapple, and added a touch of cornstarch.  The sauce was sooo tasty!! Served over brown rice for a delicious & nutritious meal!! Thumbs up!

I made this for dinner and my family loved it!  It's got a great flavor and is really quite simple.  I used a different mix of veggies, as that was what I had on hand.  I think you can't really go wrong.  We loved the pineapple and thought it added a great little bit of sweetness.  Very easy, quick, and tasty.  Thanks!

The soy sauce was a bit overpowering, but everything else about this recipe was fanastic!  We will definitely make this again.

I doubled the sauce, using half ground ginger and half fresh minced ginger; also added a touch of cayenne pepper to the sauce.  Added a very few drops of toasted sesame oil to the wok, along with the canola oil I used (would have preferred peanut oil as it heats hotter, but was out).  Used fresh veggies including onion, carrots, red bell pepper, broccoli, snow pea pods; crushed pineapple rather than chunks, and added some chopped cashews to the mix.  We enjoyed this and the veggies were especially nice after all of the holiday rich foods.  Happy New Year! :-)

I thought this had a good sauce and enjoyed it very much. I would have to say don't skip the pineapple. I also added cashews.

Awesome stir fry!!  Chicken came out very flavorful.  My husband said this is one of the best stir fry recipes yet.  I think it was the pineapple, don't skip it!  Next time I will double the soy sauce mixture, to have more sauce to give everyone on their rice.

This was great.  My husband and I both liked it and wished we had leftovers.  I was out of ginger, but it didn't matter.  It was still good.  I did double the soy mix and added about a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it up.  Worked out great.  Definitely a keeper!

So yummy. I omitted the sugar and didn't miss it. I used fresh broccoli, green pepper, carrots and minced onion in place of the frozen veggies. I served it over brown rice and my husband and 18-month-old loved it!

This was a very quick easy dinner. I omitted the sugar because I felt the pineapple would impart enough sweetness for our taste (it did). I added a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken the sauce towards the end of cooking (though I would have used cornstarch instead if I had it). Hubby and I enjoyed this with brown rice. A very flavorful, healthy meal with things you have on hand. Will make often!

This was so yummy! I left out the pineapple and used white wine vinegar. Served it with chopped brocolli, carrots and onions on top of brown rice. We all loved it. Awesome!

Very light with just the right amount of zip.  Great, tasty stir-fry recipe.  Instead of Mann's California Stir Fry, I used fresh snow peas, broccoli, celery, carrots, and green peppers.

We doubled up on the ginger because we like ginger and also added a bit of plain yogurt to the sauce just before serving. The ease and speed of preparation and so tasty.

My family loved this recipe. Like others suggested I too doubled the sauce so  there would be some left for the rice. I had mine with brown rice and my family used white rice. Both were wonderful and a plus...healthy!

When I tasted the sauce, I was thinking that it had too much ginger, but once it cooked with the chicken and veggies. It was great.  I was a little concerned my husband wouldn't like the pineapple, but he liked it and said it was a keeper!

My boyfriend and I made this the other night and it was wonderful!  We didn't use pineapple because he despises pineapple, which is too bad since I know that it would have been so yummy in it (I LOVE pineapple).  Despite that, the recipe was very easy, quick, and delicious.  The sauce was perfect.

This was really a great meal. It will become a staple at our house. I omitted the pineapple and it still turned out really well. I did not have the stir fry mix that the recipe called for, so I used the market brand (broccoli, carrots, and water chestnuts) as well as my own onion, and green pepper.

Delicious.  I didn't use the pineapple juice, just a little more water and some arrowroot to thicken it up and served it over whole wheet noodles.  Yummy.

Fast, easy, and the sauce has an awesome flavor. I will be making this often. The pineapple was a little sweet for me, so in the future I may add a little pineapple juice and leave it at that.
