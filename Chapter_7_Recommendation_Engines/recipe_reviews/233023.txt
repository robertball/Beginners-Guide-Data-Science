We thought this was a really good, easy taco dinner. I didn't use a boxed taco dinner - but used flour tortillas and 1/4 cup taco seasoning for the meat and veggie mixture. Good amount of veggie to meat ratio (we like a lot of veggies / beans mixed in) and some heat from the peppers, but not too much (I'm a spice wimp!) We fixed ours like we would any other taco - avocado, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc. Yumm!

I added a comment and rating - but it did not show up - so hopefully this is not a repetition.
This is basically adding a bag of frozen vegetables to a pre=made taco kit.  My family rated it as two stars - and gave me suggestions for how to modify it for the future.
Was OK - but we didn't really see it as a recipe per se.

I don't know what  "1 (11.04 ounce) box taco dinner kit" is - I assume that includes a package of taco seasoning.  I cooked the ground beef - drained the grease and then added taco seasoning and the 1/4 cup of water.   Cooked that down a bit and then added the bag Birds Eye® Recipe Ready Southwest Blend - which is Corn, Black Beans, Green poblano peppers, red peppers, onions.   For us this would lead itself to taco salad or burritos rather than tacos.  It does manage to stretch 1 lb of ground beef a long way - it made a lot more than I thought it would.   This recipe might be good served over rice for "mexi rice bowls."

This was a quick meal, that my family could easily pass on.  Too much corn in the vegie mix.  I made up my own taco seasoning to taste and used whole wheat flour tortillas.  And what ground beef taco doesn't have cheese on it  So we added cheese, fresh tomato and avocado.  I think the left overs will end up as nacho topping.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I made it in baked flour tortillas instead of shells.  It had just the right amount of heat, too.  The mix includes onions, corn, black beans, red bell pepper and poblano peppers.  It's especially great for just two people, as I would've spent a lot more on individual cans of vegetables and would have had too much.  A very nice Saturday night dinner!

They tasted okay made as recipe calls for, but I added cilantro since I had it here. My family also mentioned that they think it definitely needed tomatoes and cheese. I would say just make tacos or other Mexican dishes the way your family likes them and add this to step it up a bit. Definitely a lot more corn in ratio to other vegetables.  I would buy again, but make the recipe my own way.

Definitely quick and easy - so if that's what you're looking for, here you go. For my family, this needed more kick.  I chose to serve it with a choice of salsas, some fresh chopped cilantro, additional raw onion and guacamole.  This way, each of us could choose our own heat/flavor level. I also grilled fresh corn tortillas instead of using the boxed taco dinner kit.

The only thing I did different was put tortilla chips in a bowl instead of a shell.  Mostly because I’m a very messy eater so this was easier for me.  I mixed the water (made it hot) and taco seasoning together until dissolved and then mixed in the meat completely and then the vegetables.
