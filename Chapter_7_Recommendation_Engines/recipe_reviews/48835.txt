When I originally submitted this recipe to allrecipes, they changed "butterflake" biscuits to "buttermilk" in the recipe.  You should use the canned flake biscuits, not buttermilk, for this recipe, otherwise the crust is too dense.  I will email them about changing it.

I have never been to the south or eaten southern food and I must say this was very yummy! I added canned tomato instead of fresh and it was still very good! My husband loved it! Will be making again sometime!

This is a good recipe.  I agree that it can be too dense or watery but that's easily fixed by partially baking the buttermilk crust before adding tomatoes and other ingredients. The second time I made this I replaced celery with some sauteed sweet anise (it's much better than it sounds I swear) and I removed the sour cream. I also replaced the green pepper with red bell because I don't like the bitter bite of green peppers.  I think this is a good simple recipe.

I thought this recipe was good.  A little watery, but a lot of flavor. I did cook this about 3 minutes longer. I will try the butterflake biscuits next time.

This sounded so good!  Unfortunatly, we did not like this.  The biscuits were not done after 45 minutes and the sour cream, mayo, cheese topping was way too much.  I would recommend halving both the amounts of biscuits and topping and increasing the number of tomatoes.
