Simply amazing flavor!  I love this recipe, and have successfully  made the following changes:  I substituted 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 c. oil; I added 3 c. of zucchini; I made muffins instead of loaves.

This was outstanding -- my favorite zucchini bread recipe.  I substituted white chocolate chips for the semisweet, doubled the orange zest (2T), used 1/2 cup applesauce & 1/2 cup oil, and baked for about 55 minutes in a bundt pan ... turned out wonderfully!! I also added an orange glaze (2T juice, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla).  I'm making it again today but will try it out with lemon zest instead (and lemon glaze), as that is what I have on hand.

I love the different levels of flavor in this.  I only had 1 cup of zucchini I had frozen in a zippy bag, so chopped another cup of apple.  subbed out the cinnamon with apple pie spice.  Omitted nuts and used special dark chocolate chips.  I love the combo of flavor with the orange and dark chocolate, as well as the spice.  Replaced all the oil with applesauce.  This looks very pretty when cut.  *This makes a nice thick batter, so chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughtout and do not sink to the bottom which sometimes can occur in a thinner batter. A nice holiday bread with a nice change of pace from the mundane zucchini bread recipe.  The cooking time in my oven was within the perimeters stated in the recipe.

I have made these 3 times now and it gets better every time!  This is my favorite 'zucchini' bread.  The last time I made it I used the fresh orange juice and mixed with powdered sugar to make a glace while the bread was still warm~~sooooo gooddd.........thanks for this one.

MMMMMM!  FANTASTIC!  The only changes I did was substitute 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 oil and doubled the orange zest.  I baked the bread in 2, 8x8 glass baking dishes for 35 minutes. After it cooled I made an orange glaze to pour over the top of it.  Oh man....this bread did not last long!!!

This was great. Definitely wait until the loaf is chilled before slicing. There are a lot of good flavors going on with this bread. I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil, and no one could tell the difference.

I thought this was very good. I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf. The orange flavor was interesting. Not bad, just interesting. I used half Splenda half sugar. I used yogurt for the oil, used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. I also added some ground flax seed. I did grate some green apple with the zucchini but you can't even tell that it's there. This may sound strange but I put peanut butter on top when the bread was still warm and it was very good. I would make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I made it several times to use up zucchini from the garden.  To use 2x the amount of zuccini, just put 1tsp of the salt over the 4cups zucchini for a couple hours and remove the excess water.  Great!  Also add more orange zest for more flavour.

This was very good. Definitely will make this one again! I left out the nuts and nutmeg. Pressed the zucchini to get some of the liquid out, and added extra orange zest. Thanks!

This bread is awesome! As a professional crafter, I often include homemade quick breads in my booth, and this has become my bestseller!  I do what previous reviewers suggested and drizzle an orange glaze over the bread, use half white and half brown sugar, and because the first time I made it, I didin't have oil, I used melted shortening, and have kept using it since.  I make this in the disposable mini foil pans which come with the plastic lids, and this recipe will make 4 of those.  Bake them 45 instead of 50 minutes if you use the mini pans.  Great, great recipe for gift giving, too...thanks so much for sharing this one!

I cut this recipe in half. I wanted to make this recipe a little lighter, so I used half the amount of oil called for in this recipe and substituted organic unsweetened applesauce. I also cut the sugar in half. When I cut this recipe in half, the recipe asked for 1 1/2 eggs, so instead of using half of an egg, I just added two extra tablespoons of organic unsweetened applesauce. The recipe didn't specify which kind of unsweetened chocolate to use so I used mini-chocolate chips that I had on hand. I was able to get 12 muffins out of on recipe--I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. These muffins turned out dense and moist. We all really liked these muffins, though I'd like to play with the recipe a little next time. Maybe up the spices to taste, add a little vanilla and use melted butter instead of vegetable oil. I think this recipe would be good with blueberries or even raisins instead of chocolate chips, too. That's really personal choice, not reflective of the recipe.

Love, love, love! I wish I could marry this recipe!!! I followed the tips from other reviewers (1/2c apple sauce 1/2c oil and increased the zucchini to 3 cups) I made a couple of changes of my own too -  using eggbeaters instead of eggs, used an entire orange for the zest and sprinkled the top with pumpkin spice and raw sugar.  It was fantastic! My two boys kept making gagging noise saying it was gross to make bread out of zucchini - HA! They devoured it! Thanks for a great recipe and for helping to prove once again, that mommy knows best!!

My family loved this recipe.  We made one loaf and 12 muffins.  I doubled the orange zest, added 3 tablespoons orange juice (fresh), a dash of cloves, doubled the cinnamon, and I squeezed out most of the juice from the zucchini.  It turned out great, and we will be making it again!

This was the first time I ever made zucchini bread. I have a bumper crop and wanted to use them up instead of just spagetti sauce!
I took all the previous recommendations and altered the recipe to this:
3 eggs
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c white sugar
1/2 c canola oil
1/2 c orange juice concentrate
2 tsps vanilla
3 c grated zucchini
1 c chocochips
3 1/2 c whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon

I just put all the wet together and whisked then added all the dry and mix until just combined, then added chips and zucchini.
Made 6 mini loaves baked for 45 minutes
It was delicious and my mother in law who hates vegetables devoured it and still doesn't know it's zucchini!
THANKS!

Absolutely the best zucchini bread I've ever had.  Although it is more like a dessert with the chocolate chips.  Just a hint of orange.  Great with a little vanilla ice cream on the side!  This will be the first, and possibly only, zucchini bread I make from now on.

This is amazing!!  I changed the recipe a little bit.. Instead of using 1 cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup of orange juice and the remainer 1/2 cup with apple sauce. (I had no oil or orange zest at home)  They turned out REALLY well :)  Oh, I also made the recipe into 12 muffins. They only had to cook like 15 minutes :)

I can't believe I've never reviewed this, considering the many many times I've made it.  This bread is easy and delicious.  The flavors work so well together.  The only change I make is to use  mini chocolate chips instead of regular-sized.  My husband and 3 year old love it, too!

I would give this 3.5 stars if I had the option. My review is for this recipe as written, sans nuts. Loved the flavor of this bread. If you are a fan of chocolate and orange together, you'll likely enjoy this. I was a bit worried about the teaspoon of nutmeg, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it got along with the other flavors. The amount of sugar and oil in the recipe produces a pretty tender quick bread with a nice crispy crust, however I found it to be overly sweet and a bit on the oily side. I would make this again as I think it's worth experimenting on.

Delicious!!  I would definitely use applesauce for half the oil next time though, as the recipe as written is a bit oily for my taste.  I wouldn't make any other changes though, the flavors are wonderful!

Totally addicting!  This was the best zucchini loaf I ever made.  My church had a coffee house function and asked me to make 5 desserts and this was one of them.  I got so many compliments on my baking.  The only little change I made was that I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  It was so delicious w/ the orange glaze that was suggested.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Holly moley! My sister-in-law made this and it is the best. It smells sooo good and even better is its taste. She made it with the orange glaze and didn't add as many chocolate chips. It was perfect & now I'll be making it. :-)

I this recipe is great! I am not a big fan of nuts, so I ommited them. I also used dried orange zest instead of fresh and doubled it, because a few reviews said you couldn't taste the orange and I wanted to taste it. I also halfed the amount of nutmeg to make it less spiced. I would definitely make this again!

Wonderful recipe!!  The orange really makes it stand out from ordinary zucchini bread.  I used chocolate/white chocolate swirl chips.  My husband was very skeptical when I told him I made zucchini bread, but after his first slice he was hooked!  I will definitely make again.

This is the best quick bread I've ever had, not to mention the "fanciest". It really won us over. The cocolate orange combo can't be beat.  I made muffins and they came out kinda dry.  I'll try making it in a loaf pan next time and there will be a next time.  My husband thought i was kidding when i told him it was zuchinni bread!!

What a refreshing change from the "traditional" zucchini breads! My husband and son raved about it. I almost wish the zucchini in the garden wasn't finished already.. ALMOST, but not quite. LOL The orange flavor is not overpowering and complements the chocolate flavor nicely. This is a definite keeper.

Pretty good!  I used applesauce for 1/2 the oil, a little more zucchini, and orange extract instead of zest (didn't have any on hand).  Baked for 55 min. in a silicone bread pan.

YUM!!! I made muffins out of these and they were AWESOME! Changes: I used 3/4 cup oil (instead of a full cup - they were plenty moist), omitted the nuts, used 1/2 tsp nutmeg (instead of 1 tsp), used the zest of one orange (which was probably more than what the recipe called for), and replaced one cup of the flour with white whole wheat flour.

This bread was great.  I thought 2 cups of sugar would be too sweet so I used 1 1/2 cups; also used half oil & half unsweetened applesauce. Everyone loved it!

YUM!! I wish I could give this 10 stars! I can't stop eating this bread! The chocolate and orange combination is like a drug or something - addictive! The only thing I changed was to use mini chocolate chips as per other reviews so they didn't sink to the bottom. This is my new zucchini bread recipe - thank you!!

This recipe was absolutely a winner.  Everyone who tried it loved it, and it was gone very quickly.  This will be made again and again.  What a great way to use up all those zucchini from the garden!

I love this recipe! It combines a lot of things I love; oranges, zucchini, chocolate chips, and macadamia nut (instead of walnuts). The first time I made this bread, I followed the recipe as is. I am not a big fan of spice cake, so the bread wasn't exactly to my liking. This time I doubled the orange zest, omitted the spice, and used applesauce instead of oil. Yum, Yum, Yummy!! Each time I also made a pan of muffins cooked for 22 minutes, and one loaf cooked for the entire 50 minutes. The bread stayed moist for at least a week and I froze the muffins to enjoy later. Thank you for sharing such a unique, delicious recipe!

Delicious!  I omitted chocolate chips because I don't care for sweet breads with them.  I added an extra teaspoon or so of orange zest for more flavor.  I only have one loaf pan, so I used the remaining batter for muffins and they turned out great after baking about 25 minutes.  I also made a little glaze of powdered sugar, milk, and orange zest to taste--yummy!

OMG! I was soo surprised at how well this was and the chocolate chips in it was a wonderful taste which I hadn't expected. Thank you for sharing this recipe. My neighbors also were thankful when I gave out mini loaves for Xmas.

Delicious! I left out the nuts (I was sharing with someone who has an allergy), the chocolate chips, and nutmeg (didn't have any). I replaced 2/3 of the oil with plain yogurt, and probably used closer to 3 cups zucchini, and it turned out fantastic.

Finally a zucchini bread that I like because it was never a favorite here.  Guess it is the orange that makes the difference - gives it some zing and a more sophisticated flavor.   Just too sweet tho - really do not need all that sugar so cut it back by 1/2 cup and also subsituted applesauce for half the oil.  These are changes I normally make. This is so rich tasting we use it as a dessert.

My daughter loves these..I leave out the nuts and add extra dark choc chips and extra orange zest.  I also use 1/2 c less sugar and make them into muffins. I freeze some muffins so she can pull them out for breakfast when she wants them instead of store bought muffins

this is reeealllly tasty! the only changes I made was to use hershey's special dark chocolate chips instead of regular semi-sweet, and I used hazelnuts in place of walnuts. I also make sure to peel my zucchini before I grate it so that people aren't thrown off by seeing green pieces in their bread.

MMMM yummy!  I have made this as a 'thank you' gift a couple of times now.  I doubled the orange zest, used milk chocolate chips which I cut back to 1/2 cup, put an orange glaze on the top while still hot and substituted applesauce for the oil.  First time I made it I used the oil, second time 1/2 and 1/2 and third time 100% apple sauce.  We liked it best with the applesauce, and as a bonus,  it is healthier too!  YUMMY!

The best flavor combination ever!  This is our favorite zucchini bread recipe from my three year old grandaughter to my husband.  Changing it in any way will do it no justice.  I pass it on to all my friends.

I've made this a few times since my husband is bringing in bushels of zukes from his garden every day. We also had 19 lbs of apricots which make a great sub for applesauce... and freezing them straight from the tree make prep much easier. No blanching needed, and they defrost mushy, so pits just pop out when cooking down.
I omitted oil, used the stewed apricot, half the sugar, lime zest,Ghirardelli chips, increased cinnamon to 1tsp and 3+ cups of sweated zucchini. We are high altitude, so increased baking time to 1 hour. This made 4 mini loaves and a thin regular load. GORGEOUS, and now freezing them for Christmas presents.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it is by far my favorite zucchini bread recipe.  I usually make a few changes to make it a bit healthier...and it still turns out great!  I replace 1C all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, I substitute applesauce for half of the oil and use only 1-1/2C sugar.  Also, I use mini semisweet chips and have no problem with them sinking like the regular chips sometimes do.  And be sure not to overbake it...it's best when it's still a bit soft in the middle.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I love this recipe and have been making it for a few years.  I have modified it and made it into a diabetic recipe and I am planning on entering in the county fair this year.  I used 1 c. baking Splenda for the sugar and unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used 3T. of orange zest.  My family loved the changes!

This was a very good recipe. It is 4 and 1/2 stars.  I used it as a base and made the changes based on other reviews and personal preferences.  I omitted the choc chips since I'm not really a fan of them in breakfast foods.  I sub'd apple sauce for 1/2 the oil, used 1 cup splenda and 1 cup brown sugar instead of all white.  increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, and used 1 cup white wheat flour instead of all white and added 1/2 tsp orange extract.  I also baked it in a bundt pan.  It was done in 48 minutes. A very good zuke bread - love the orange flavor.

A-MAZ-ING!!  First time I made something like it and it was such a hit that people kept asking for more at work!  Coating the chocolate chips with flour kept them from sinking.  I used a bundt pan and covered it with an orange glaze.  The glaze was from juicing the orange used for the zesting and powered sugar.  Full of flavor!

Some one brought this to work.  They offered me a slice and I've been thinking about it ever since, and I'm not even a big fan of zucchini bread.  I asked for the recipe because I have to make this.  It is just delicious.

Whoa! After reading most reviews I decided I definitely had to try this recipe out...Absolutely delicious, the combination of flavors is incredible. The orange is not overpowering,the chocolate is just the right amount and the zucchini keeps it moist. Thanks for sharing this one, it will stay in my recipe box for years to come and will be used at holidays!! Yummy, you have to try this for yourselves!!!

This is awesome!!  That little hint of orange with the chocolate chips is great.  My family and friends love it.  Can be made as mini loaves--just cut the baking time to about half.

I didn't much care for this at first  The flavors all seem to compete with one another.  I was going to give it a "thumbs down" review.  But then..something miraculous happened.  I had wrapped the loaves up nice and snug in some plastic wrap, and the next day I tried another piece..and voila..it was really good...all the flavors blended and merged and learned to cooperate with each other!  So, that's my recommendation.  When the bread cools, wrap it up nice and tight and let it sit for a day!

Very moist!  I made muffins rather than loaves and baked them for 25 minutes.  Also added another Tablespoon of orange zest and an extra handfull of chips.  ALSO used the Splenda Baking Blend - seem a bit too sweet so next time I'll cut down to 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  A good muffin and a good way to get the kiddies to eat a green veggi!

This was OK, but nothing special.  I had to bake it 20 extra minutes before it was done.  The bread didn't have enough spice for my taste. I couldn't even taste the orange.

It's settled. This is the best zucchini bread there is ever. The hint of orange is subtle and so good with the semi-sweet chocolate. A match made in Heaven. I highly recommend using mini morsels. Nice and moist. This bread freezes very well. Fabulous!

very nice bread! I put it into a bundt pan and it was done in an hour. It's so moist, and the chocolate chips don't sink to the bottom.

I had never made a zucchini bread before so this was my first attempt.  I made this bread without the orange zest and walnuts.  I added one additional cup of zucchini to make 3 cups total and it was EXCELLENT!  Simple recipe and tasted great.

Yummy!  A few modifications I changed, fitting to what several other people suggested, I also ran out of walnuts, so subbed it out as well:

1 Cup of Oil => 1/2 Cup Oil + 1/2 Cup Orange Juice
Orange Zest => Fresh Lemon Zest (2 Lemons = 1 TBSP)
Walnuts =>  Cranberries (Craisins, Dried Cranberries)

It tasted SUPER Good!  Makes a fantastic bread for sitting out on the porch in the evening with a cool glass of sun tea snacking away!

Delicious! 
I used milk chocolate chips (because that is what we prefer) and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil because we like the taste of it and use it in most of our baking.

Wow! These were great! I did make a few changes, basically because of what I had on hand:  I didn't have zucchini so I subbed with shredded apples, Used applesauce instead of oil, 2 eggs, no nuts, and added some fresh squeeze orange juice...and when prepping I blended the dry with the wet then folded in the shredded apple, chocolate chips, and orange zest.  I made 26 cupcakes instead of bread. Just sprayed muffin tins w/ nonstick spray and baked about 15 minutes.   DELICIOUS!

Great bread. I also replaced half the oil with apple sauce and it was still moist. Used a little less choc chips too. It doubled nicely. It had a wonderful combination of unique flavors. A great way to use up frozen summer grated zuch!

This recipe is amazing! I think there should be just a tiny bit more of orange zest. Yesterday was my first time baking it, and next time I'm thinking of having 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, 1/2 cup choclate chips instead of all chocolate chips. This is a great recipe and I will for sure be making it again!

I didn't particularly like this bread when I first tried it. I didn't think it had much flavor....but the next day, WOW! it was great. So, I recommend letting it mellow for a day. I will try it again.

Excellent.  I added a little orange juice to bring in more flavor.  Substituted Sucanat for half of the sugar, used some wheat flour and did 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Delicious, no change in consistency.  This made big muffins, mini muffins and mini loafs.

I would not have thought this combination could work so well together. Be sure to test the bread at 50 minutes to be sure it is done. Very tasty, and maybe the zucchini and walnuts almost make it good for you :)

Used 3 packed cups of Zucchini in this recipe along with 2 T of orange zest. Wonderful flavor, super moist, needed to be cooked a bit longer because of moisture, apx 65 min.

Yummie! This was so easy to make and tastes great. I'm slicing up my baking and individually wrapping them to put in the freezer. This way I can take out what I need for school lunches and it doesn't get eaten all in one go.

This is a most delicious version of zucchini bread. I also used the juice of the orange and mixed it with powdered sugar to create a clear glaze. I pierced the warm bread with a cake tester before I poured the glaze over it. Additionally, I made it as healthly as possible - egg whites, apple sauce, included one very ripe banana to make it sweeter (and reduce the sugar to 1.25 cups). YUM!!

I had zucchini I needed to use and wanted to find something different.  This was what I was looking for!  Bread was very moist and the orange added an interesting flavor.   I used 2 Tablespoons of the orange zest but otherwise did not alter the recipe.  I will be making this one again!

I made muffins out of these.  I baked them for 25 minutes.  The result is that the texture of the bread is moist but noone in my family likes the chocolate chips in the bread.  It gives a weird tasting flavor to the bread.

This bread is AWESOME! I got so many compliments on it. Very moist and very good, and it feels so healthy eating it. I used pecans instead of walnuts and it was great.

Good texture and moistness. I used 1 tsp orange extract and 1 tsp vanilla and switched amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg. May make this again and try an orange glaze on top for more flavor.

Very good but a little dry.  I brought it to work and it was definately a hit.  I didn't add the walnuts.

I made these as muffins. Didn't have nut or orange zest. Still turned out wonderful. Will be making again. Kids loved them didn't even know the muffins had zucchini in them. These were great. can't wait to make them with the nuts and orange zest. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my family's favorite zucchini bread/muffin recipe.  It's the orange/chocolate combination.  Yum!  I use 1/2 tbspn fresh orange zest, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp oragne extract. I always make it with the first zucchini of the season.

This bread was absolutely delicious, I made it with orange extract because I didn't have orange zest...I made one loaf with chocolate chips and one plain...both were equally delicious!

I've enjoyed making this recipe for a few years now and get requests to make it every Christmas.  It's good to make ahead of time and keep in the freezer, then thaw (wrapped in plastic) for a day before slicing. I substitute applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.

This is the best Zucchini Bread recipe I have found!  The flavors are so great together.  I made the recipe as is with a little more orange zest the first time and LOVED it!  Today I played with the recipe to make it healthier and my kids loved it just as much!!!  The orange and chocholate are what really make it so great!
I used the following to make 12 muffins or 1 loaf:
1 3/4 whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 ground flaxseeds or wheat germ
1 1/2 - 2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 cup natural sugar
1 cup vanilla low-fat yogurt or applesauce
2 tbsp safflower oil
1/3 cup low fat milk 
1 cup of firmly packed grated zucchini
1 tbsp. orange zest
3/4 cup of chocholate chips
Cook 20 -25 minutes
Sooo good!!!!!
Best way to use up zucchini from the garden!

A MUST TRY!!! This recipe is amazing. So easy and tastes awesome. I omitted the nuts and increase the orange zest and chocolate chips. I made one large loaf and 6 muffins. And they were a big hit. What a great way to get my kids to eat zucchini!!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Excellent.  My family loves to try new recipes for zucchini bread and this one didn't disappoint us.  The only change I made was to use orange extract instead of vanilla.  Even so, the orange flavor was very subtle.  Great recipe.

I chopped zucchini in the food processor, used apple sauce instead of oil, and added extra chocolate chips and orange rind.  I made one small loaf and the rest as muffins.  Delicious!  Next time I'd likely cut the nutmeg in half.

It was great!  I especially liked the crunchy crust as contrasted with the sweet moist interior.  I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes for it to be completely done. No problem with that, though. It was worth the wait.

This was so good!  A friend gave me a monster zucchini, enough for this bread and a chocolate chip zucchini cake.  I made one loaf with nuts, no chips, and the other with chips, no nuts.  While measuring everything out first, I forgot that I was making 2 loaves, so there was 1 full cup of chips in one, and 1 full cup of nuts in the other.  Delicious!  I loved the hint of orange in both breads.  Definite keeper!

These were really good! The only change I made was to double the orange zest and I also used dark chocolate chips. The only change I would make in the future would be to use orange extract because even doubling the zest didn't give it a very strong orange flavor.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing!! I am gluten free so just replaced the flour with GF flour. I also replaced half the oil with apple sauce and half the sugar with erythritol. My first batch came out a little crumbly so I put a tablespoon less flour and lowered the temperature slightly and it came out perfect!

This bread is very good! Only change was to use half oil, half unsweetened applesauce, and I actually used 1/2 tsp baking powder by mistake.  I'd probably double the cinnamon next time, as I couldn't really taste it.  Great texture, and good flavor.  I considered adding some orange juice, but I'm actually glad I did not - the orange flavor from the zest was just right.  Went so well with the chocolate!  Will definitely make this one again!

SO GOOD! I can't keep myself away from this bread. I'm a huge fan of orange and chocolate combinations, so this was right up my alley. I halved the recipe to make just one loaf and added the juice of half an orange. The bread is super moist and has great, vibrant flavors. I'll definitely make again. Thanks :)

This is an unusual combination of flavors.  Not great, not horrible, just different.  I had a problem with the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom, as well as this sticking to the pan, even though it was thoroughly greased.  I am glad I gave this a try, but probably won't be making again.

I make this recipes exactly as it was written and I found it to be good...not great.  I was surprised how much of the orange flavor came through.  I think I will make it again just when I am looking for something different.

This is AMAZING. I had no nutmeg so I left that out, but it still turned out great. I thought it could have taken a little more zucchini...maybe 2.5 cups or so. Will be making this again!

Great recipe.   I followed some of the other reviewers and substituted 1 c. unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil.  I also had frozen some zucchini and summer squash, so I thawed them out in the microwave and squeezed out the excess water before adding to the recipe.  I also added 1-1/2 c. mini chocolate chips, no walnuts and 2 tsp. orange extract instead of the vanilla extract.  I didn't add any zest because I didn't have any, but the extract was a great substitute.  I did muffins instead of bread and it made 3 dozen muffins.  I baked the muffins for about 20 minutes.  Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

This was a delicious change to the normal zucchini bread.  It's my new favorite!  I squeezed a little bit of the fresh orange juice into the batter and didn't include all of the zucchini "juice."

I just didn't like the flavors in this.   It was too much.  I think I would try this without the chocolate chips or maybe without the cinnamon and nutmeg, but not with all those things.

Just delicious--perfect balance of flavor.  I added pecans instead of walnuts and since I can't get chocolate chips, I grated a chocolate bar!  The whole family loved it.

This was easy and delicious! I took one of the suggestions from a comment to sub 1/2 the oil and used applesauce and it turned out super moist and hopefully a little more healthy!  I served it for our bible study and everyone raved about it!

The orange adds nice zip, offset by the sweetness of the chips.  I cut the oil in 1/2 and sub in apple sauce instead. Absolutely my families favorite zucchini bread recipe.

Suprisingly good flavor combinations!!  This has become a favorite at our house.  I followed the recipe except I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup and it was still very moist.  I also recommend straining the shredded zucchini of excess water before adding to the batter.

This is good zucc bread.  It didn't last long at my house.  I think it could use more choc chips.  I'll make again.  I tried making them as muffins too but thought they were dry so I'll stick with the bread.

I've made this twice in the last 4 days. A plethera of zucchini had me baking like crazy. The 1st go I followed as directed except I used grapefruit zest as it was the only rind I had handy (turned out great). The 2nd time I made in muffin tins and would suggest mini chocolate chips as the larger ones sink to the bottom. Also cut the bake time down about 20 min. The firehouse LOVED these!

This recipe is top notch.  The aroma of the orange and chocolate awakens the senses.  I did find it just a touch dry the first time I made it and I think I skimped on the zucchini a little, so I added more each subsequent time and its has been just right.

Very good.  I did one loaf and the other half in muffin tins for 25-30 min.  I found that the 'muffins' came out better, because the chocolate chips seemed to fall to the  bottom of the loaf.  Plus the muffins formed a nice crispy glaze around the edge and top.  Loved the orange taste with the chocolate chips and zucchini, definitely a keeper.

It wasn't my favorite, but everyone else really liked it.  I am not sure if it was because of the almond extract.  I like it, but maybe it was too much.

Fantastic recipe!  My family loved it!  Even my picky eater boys.  Only thing I changed was I didn't put in the nuts and I switched the amounts on the cinnamon and nutmeg, I just reversed them so there was 1 tsp cinnamon, simply because I'm not a big nutmeg fan.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  I will definitely be making it again!

Really great recipe. I also used applesauce instead of oil and held the nuts but would love to try it with nuts sometime. Really great taste and the zucchini is a great vegetable to hide in this kind of recipe for kids to enjoy. I might try it with squash as well.

A very tasty & moist bread. Increased the zucchini to 3-4 cups for 2 loaves of bread as recommended by other cooks. I used 50% all purpose flour and 50% whole wheat flour for a heavier textured bread.  Used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar but will reduce the amount next time as it was a tad sweet. As we didn't have any chocolate chips at home, I chopped up a 100g bar of Belgian Cote d'Or NOIR Orange 70% cocoa and added 1 tablespoon of lime juice and used lime zest instead which worked very well with the recipe. It was excellent. Thank you!

Very good. I changed up the recipe. I pureed some drained canned apricots and substituted for all of the oil. I also used orange extract and did not have any chocolate chips in the house but used pecans. I made muffins with half the recipe and large ones were ready in 25 minutes. With the other half of the recipe, I used a square cake pan and sprinkled with coconut.

The bread turned out excellent.  I followed the recipe precisely (minus the nuts) and had no problems.  The orange zest adds just the right amount of flavor.  I was also happy to see that the chocoalte chips stayed mixed evenly throughout the bread instead of sinking to the bottom like in many other recipes.  I will be making more soon!

I just finished making this and trying it.  It was super easy to make, fast and yummy.  The only thing different that I did was to split the white sugar with brown sugar (half and half).

Yummmmy!!  I just made this and it is absolutely scrumptious!  I didn't have orange zest, so I grated the rind of a lemon I had (about 1 Tbsp.) and put that in.  I also used half oil and half applesauce.  I probably used closer to 3 cups of grated zucchini.  I really packed it in 2 cups and threw in some extra.  I didn't have walnuts on hand so I used chopped pecans.  I tried the glaze that some suggested and I think it's perfect without it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that will definitely stay in my recipe box and will make many many more times!!

These were fantastic! I decided to make muffins out of the mix so I could share more and everyone LOVED them. I didn't have walnuts, but I added unsalted sunflower seeds instead - and I also had a little bit of extra shredded coconut I decided to throw in as well... sooooo yummy! Definitely making these again.

Made this last summer (exactly as written!) and froze the loaves.  Just pulled out of the freezer yesterday - freezes beautifully btw.  Don't skip the orange peel.  It makes the bread very flavorful and uniquely delicious.  I will definitely make again (exactly as written) with this year's zucchini. But I won't wait 8 months to try it. It's just too yummy! ;)

I've made this many times with the endless zucchini we got from our garden.  It turns out great every time!  I follow tips a few others suggested - use half applesauce (instead of all the oil) and I use chocolate chunks instead of chips (and use more than 1 cup).  People at work and my husband all love it!

Really enjoyed this.  Nice and moist with just a hint of orange.   Even though I baked it at 350 Degrees, I found it needed much more time than that.  
But would make this again.. Thanks for sharing.

This is spectacular! I followed the recipe as is and it tastes great! In place of the walnuts I used pecans. I only had one bread pan, so I made the remaining into muffins. A definite good choice!!! Wow...these are great! For the muffins, I baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.

This is delicious but then I am a big fan of the orange/chocolate combination.  I omitted the spices for this reason, too.  I used 12 ounces (3 cups) of grated zucchini, combined it with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and let it sit and drain for a half hour or so to prevent it from being too "wet" and heavy.  Next time I will try the glaze and will definitely use mini chips instead of regular ones for less sinking and better chocolate distibution.  A wondeful change from traditional zucchini bread.

This is a great snacking bread. I would have given it 5 stars, but it was a little too sweet, for us.  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. The second day the flavors were more developed. I used 1/2 tsp. freshly  ground nutmeg, sauteed the walnuts in 1 tsp. butter before chopping (it really develops the flavor), used canola oil and the zest from 1 med. orange. All other ingredients were as written. As suggested by another reviewer, I glazed it, while the bread was still warm, stirring together 2 T. fresh orange juice, 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/8 tsp. vanilla. This definitely kicked it up a notch and the presentation was nice.  Thanks for a great recipe Jules.  :-)

Be sure to put the orange zest into the bread.  I made it once without and it was just ok.  Extra zest along with an orange glaze makes this bread delicious.

This was so good!! Somehow the orange didn't make it home from the store, but the bread was great without it. Took about 60 minutes to bake in two pans instead of 50 minutes.

This recipe was good, but I found the orange flavour to be very overwhelming (and I love orange).  I'll make it again, but next time I'll use half of the orange rind.

This is a very good loaf, moist and flavorful.  Nice for breakfast with a bit of butter spread on but tasty without.  Will definetly do this one again when I have zucchini to use up.

I love it! I think I'll add a little more orange zest next time because I couldn't taste it as much as I was expecting to, but this was an awesome recipe. We'll make it again for sure!

This did not last in my house. I've never made zucchini bread before, but this was a hit. Feel free to add in extra chocolate chips (I did). I tried some new bakeware (the flexible kind), and the bread came right out.

I experimented with a lighter version on this, and it came out well.  I integrated some of the suggestions of teh cooking light zucchini bread recipe.  Used 1/2 cup egg substitute, only 1 cup of the sugar, only 1/3 cup of the oil and 1 cup of sugar free applesauce. A full Tbsp of the vanilla extract, 2 full Tbsp of the orange zest and a full teaspoon of the cinnamon.  Very nice zucchini bread.

Very yummy!  As others have stated in reviews, waiting until the next day after chilling overnight produces a better taste.  I, too, had to bake for an extra 15 minutes as the batter was still soupy on top after the designated 50 minutes.

This was wonderful! My kids who don't generally like zucchini bread loved this! The chocolate/orange combo was very different, but in a good way. I did substitute applesauce for the vegatable oil though. It was very good. Will for sure make this again.

Yummy.  Great way to use all that zucchini from the garden.  My only changes were using Splenda instead of sugar, left out the walnuts because the kids do not like and unfortunately, I found out that I did not have orange zest so I substituted lemon zest.  (I was a little worried about that)  The bread turned out excellent and had top reviews by everyone.  Next time I will try the orange zest but the lemon zest turned out fine also.  Thanks Jules

This is THE BEST zucchine bread recipe I have EVER made. I froze a loaf and got it out a few days later and was even better!  I also altered the sugar with half white sugar and half sucanut. Was also very generous with the spices. WONDERFUL!!!!!!

I made 21 muffins out of this recipe (filled the muffin tins to the brim) and baked for nearly 25 minutes.  

I poked holes in the tops of the muffins while they were still warm and drizzled an icing sugar/orange juice glaze, suggested by another reveiwer, over the tops of the muffins.  

OH WOW were these a taste sensation!

I also found it best to add another tablespoon of orange zest.

The results of this recipe were great. Many rave reviews. I made 3 smaller loaves, but the cooking time was still around 50 minutes. I also replaced the oil with applesauce and it worked divinely! My only criticism (and its a small one) is that it was a little too sweet for my taste, but I was the only one who thought so! Thanks for this recipe. It'll be used every zucchini season from now on.

I really liked the recipe. However, next time I'll use the whole bag of chocolate chips.  I wanted more chocolate.  I also took the orange, after zesting, juiced it and added powdered sugar to make a thick glaze.  Once the bread was out of the oven, I pricked the top with a tooth pick and added glaze on top and cooled.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is my favorite sweet bread recipe.  I seek out neighbors' over abundant zucchini patches just to make this.  I omit the nuts and double the chocolate chips using milk chocolate.  I always quadruple the recipe using an extra tablespoon of orange rind.  Freezing this bread after it's baked enhances the flavors tenfold and gives it a moist texture. Everyone raves over it!

This was a hit at our family reunion!  I substituted applesauce for about 3/4 of the oil and added a little more orange zest than the recipe called for.  The result was a very moist, delicious, low-fat bread.  Everyone commented on how much they liked the blend of orange with the chocolate chip.  This one's definitely a keeper!

I made several of these little loaves last year and froze them in small loaf pans for christmas gifts. People loved them. I intend to do the same this year.  Very moist and extremely delicious bread with a unique flavor to it.

I made this yesterday, when I went to get my Chocolate Chips I found that I didn't have any, I had forget that ome of my Granddaughters had made Chocolate Chip Cookies when she was here. So I added 1 cup Of Raisins. Very good with the Orange Zest. But, next time I'll have the chocolate Chips. Yummy anyway.I also used 2/3cup of oil & 1/2 cup applesauce. Nice & moist.

First of all this is my favorite site.  I love the recipe reviews that are posted.  If it wasn't for the reviews on the zucchini chocolate chip orange bread I would never have tried this recipe.  This is by far the best zucchini bread I have ever made.  The texture and taste are excellent.  I couldn't imagine chocolate chips in zucchini bread but that is what is so good.   Fabulous recipe.  I would make this often. Thank you.

I chopped zucchini too small in shredder.  Bigger chunks would have allowed thicker batter and chips not to settle to bottom.  Still great!

I followed the recipe perfectly and I can say this is the most delicious zucchini bread I’ve ever tasted.  My family LOVED it.  The orange zest is brilliant.  It’s not over powering but gives the bread a lovely orange essence that pairs beautifully with the chocolate chips. 
Try this and you’ll love it.

Used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, never missed the oil! Also used 1/2 white and brown sugar, mini choc chips, and baked in 9x13 pan for 40 minutes at 345 (glass pan). A very generous cake/bread in a 9x13, easily 15 servings. Forgot orange zest, but still DELICIOUS! Terrific recipe, thanks for sharing

I made this to take to a potluck for work and my boss and co-workers were amazed. I was actually told by several people they would buy loaves of the bread from me if I would make some for them. Needless to say this is amazingly good.

Delicious! I gave it to some younger kids, and they couldn't even taste the zucchini :) It's a good way to sneak in vegetables ;) Loved it, the bread is just the right amount of sweet and tangy, the orange makes it amazing!

This was our first ever zucchini bread and it was quite nice. I only made one loaf.

Great way to use up garden zucchini.  I measured the 3 cups of "dry" zucchini, meaning I measured it AFTER I drained off all the juice.  I used 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 tsp. of orange extract, since I only had half of a fresh orange (I'm saving the 2 T. of juice for the glaze). I had to improvise and combine lemon and orange zest to total 1 T., but it's so delicious.  I love freshly grated nutmeg and used 1 tsp. of it, along with the cinnamon. I never use all the sugar suggested when baking, and this recipe is good with just 1 C. sugar and 1/4 C. Splenda.  Plenty sweet.  And plenty good!

The firat time I made this, I was still wanting more chocolate, less orange....but I will say that it was nice and moist, and the bread had a nice flavor, not too sweet or spicy, but enough. The second time I made it, I used more chocolate, and left out the orange - and it was exactly as I liked. Still good base recipe, thanks!

Oh my gosh this recipe was FANTASTIC!!  I made some changes though.  Instead of using 3 cups of all-purpose flour I used 1 cup and subbed the other 2 using oat flour and coconut flour.  I also subbed applesauce for the oil and added and additional 1/2 cup of it and added 2/3 cup of orange juice.  Because I used oat flour I knew that the batter would be really dry so adding the extra applesauce and orange juice was perfect.  These turned out AMAZING!!  They were moist and tasted like mini dessert muffins!    I will definetly be making this recipe again!!

I've tried this recipe three times and love the flavor. Don't kid yourself--it is not healthful, in spite of the zucchini, but it's the only way I can get my husband or kids to eat zucchini. What you should know about this is that 50 minutes at 350 degrees is about 25 minutes less than what it needs to bake--and I like it soft and a tiny but gooey in the middle! It is a total pain to find this out after it has cooled.

Yum! I've never made zucchini bread before, and I have to admit this was a very quick, easy, and satisfying recipe. I was out of orange zest so I didn't use it at all,  and didn't use nuts. (Maybe next time) Like many reviewers suggested, I coated my chocolate chips with flower so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. This bread formed a wonderful crust on the outside leaving the inside soft and decadent.  A great way to use up your Zucchini, or get kids who otherwise won't eat it to gobble it down. I'll definitely use this again and modify it according to what I have on hand. I'd like to try peanut butter instead of oil. :)

This one is a keeper for sure. Extremely moist but not dense- still rises high (but I did increase baking powder to 1 tsp instead of 1/4 tsp). my tips are... 
1) 1C brown sugar + 1/2C white sugar (can even cut out white sugar. This bread is sweet already, especially if you are going to add chocolate chips)
2) used 2 medium sized zuccs
3) used 1 tsp baking powder (along with 1 tsp of backing soda)
4) Increased cinnamon to 1 tbsp and used 1 tsp of all spices instead of nutmeg
5) used 1C of whole wheat floor + 2 C white flour
6) used 1/2C oil + 1/2C apple sauce
7) added 1tsp of orange extract since I had it in my pantry

** YUMM. really good and moist. I kept 1 loaf wrapped in tin foil and saran wrap in the fridge for 4 days and it was still perfect 4 days later. This recipe is highly recommended!!

Delicious.  I use mini chocolate chips to help distribute the chocolate flavor.  I also use about double the orange zest because I like the flavor it adds.

Great recipe! I also cut the oil to half and used apple sauce. As another reviewer suggested, I used diced apple in place of half the zucchini because I didn't have enough. I also used pecans instead of walnuts (not a fan of walnuts). I followed the rest and got exactly 24 beautifully dense moist muffins. Don't be afraid of the nutmeg! Thanks for a keeper!

Tastes good. I zested two small/medium sized oranges and was a little worried that it wouldn't have enough orange flavour, but it actually has enough and maybe could be a little less. I used half applesauce and half oil, and about x1.5 times more for the amount of zucchini. I didn't have walnuts so left out. Overall I like the flavour, but just because I undercooked, the bread tore badly. I will try again.

While the bread has very nice flavor, I have some issues with the recipe. It needed more flour; the batter was VERY thin; all of my chips sank to the bottom. And the loaf pans should have been greased and floured; one of the loaves broke in half and the other left a quarter of it stuck in the pan.

I would like to give this bread 4.5 stars.  It is moist and flavorful.  If I ever make it again, I would add more orange zest to increase the orange flavor.  The current amount is a bit subtle for my taste.  I, too, made a quick glaze of fresh squeezed orange juice, powdered sugar and vanilla.  This is a good breakfast sweet bread.

very very good as I grow zucchini in my garden! I use less sugar and put a bit of oatmeal in it! Tastes great ! and it is healthy. I substitute half of the oil with soyamilk.

Best zucchini bread I ever tasted!  For some reason though, it stuck to my loaf pan and wouldn't come out in one piece.  Next time I will try some parchment paper.  And there will definitely be a next time.  I threw out my previous zucchini bread recipe, and am keeping this one!

Very Good!  I made a few substitutions: I used an intense orange dark chocolate bar. It actually had pieces of orange rind in it!  I didn't have any cinnamon so I used a pinch of ginger and an 1/8 teaspoon cloves.  Came out great! I have made it twice already!

I love zuchinni bread and this bread was okay but I probably won't make it again.  It sounds a lot better than it tastes.  It was moist enough.  I also made "Blueberry Zucchini Bread" the same time and it was delicious -- recommend you try that recipe first.

these are pretty fantastic!  They are moist and very flavorful.  The organge zest really adds to the mixture well. However the changes I made was that instead of the zucchini I added finely chopped apples as I was all out it.  I also omitted the choco chips since I don't like chocolate.  They were still wonderfully delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Really enjoyed this recipe. I also used 2 tbs. of orange zest like another reviewer recommended. Next time I think I'll use mini chocolate chips in hopes that they won't all sink to the bottom like the regular size did. Great combination of flavors.

Good, but not "wow". Very orangey, I might cut back on the zest. It makes it taste...not like zucchini...which isn't why I make zucchini bread. Left out walnuts, upped chocolate chips accordingly. Very moist. Reduced the oil.

Delicious! Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose. Also chopped up a premium dark chocolate bar rather than chocolate chips. Used 1/4 cup canola oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. Very good!!

A very heavy, dry and very dense bread.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil and that may be why it wasn't very moist.  I also used whole wheat flour.  This did not turn out well for me.  Perhaps if I had followed the directions exactly I might have had better results.

Great recipe, very addicting and delicious bread. Super moist with tons of flavour. Always up the zucchini to 3 cups, add 1/4 tsp. cloves and increase cinnamon + nutmeg slightly. Very versatile. ***Second Yummy Variation: All i had was sweetened coconut and carrots, so i shredded those instead of zucchini. Of course i used slightly less sugar, and about 1/4 cup brown to sub for some of white. Lends to a deeper flavour and moister bread. Also didnt have any orange so i used lemon zest... turned out great! Everyone raved and gobbled it up.***

Soooo Good!!  Recipe is just perfect the way it is.  My neighbor always gives us zucchini from her garden.  I'll be making this many times this summer and freezing the loaves for next winter.  What a treat. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Made this recipe to the letter.  With all the great reviews I thought I was in for something great.  I was very disappointed and upset that I wasted my chocolate chips on this recipe.  Well lets just say it kind of tasted like fruit cake.  I will stay with the lemon blueberry zucchini bread recipe I have for a different zucchini bread.  I did not like this at all.  Will not make it again.

I would probably give this recipe only 4 stars, but I don't really like orange flavored food. However, my husband loves orange especially with chocolate and I made these for him. If he could he would give this bread 6 stars. He gobbled these up like crazy! I made these just like the recipe called except I made muffins and I used butter instead of oil and I had to use a little brown sugar because I ran out of white. Lastly, I forgot to buy nuts so I omitted the nuts. I really wish I hadn't forgot them because I think the nuts would have been really good. Overall, I think these muffins are great if someone is inclined to like orange. I don't even care for orange and I ate about 7 or 8 of them.

This bread is great!  The combination of chocolate and orange really enhance the recipe. My whole family enjoys it - kids too.  I sprinkle some coarse sugar on top before baking to make the crust pretty and a little crunchy!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  Very moist and lots of flavor.  My whole family and friends loved it.  I even changed it a bit to make it healthier.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, deleted the cinnamon, used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda and added 4 tsps of wheat gluten to help it rise.  EXCELLENT!  Highly recommend this one.

I was looking for a yummy way to use my zucchini that both my boyfriend and I would enjoy. The mixture of the chocolate chips and orange is a tastefully twist to an original recipe. I not only enjoyed the bread itself but the smell it spread throughout my home. Wonderful! Superb! I will definitely make this again.

these are great! i also used half splenda and half brown sugar. i also left out the nuts, my bf hates them! i made this into muffins and they are superb. i made an orange glaze as well, but i think this would be great without it.. it gets a little too sweet with the glaze.

This was a great zucchini bread recipe - a litte different from the norm.  I did the usual applesauce for oil substitution and added a teaspoon of orange extract for additional flavor.  I upped the amount of cinnamon to 3/4t, reduced the nutmeg to 1/4t and addd 1/8t of cloves.  We'll be making this often with our bumper crop of zucchini.

This has a wonderful flavor, but I suggest using 2T of orange zest instead of one. One T barely gives an orange flavor at all in my experience. I used one stick of meted butter and one 1/2 cup of oil instead of all oil. This is probably why mine was not as moist as I would like it. I will use the full cup next time.  If you have a convection oven, you probably already know this, but just in case, definately reduce the temperature 15 degrees and only cook for 45 minutes. The taste is fantastic without being to overly sweet or cake like. Made two beautiful loaves. I will definately make this again. Bravo.

This had great flavor and texture.  I loved the addition of orange to this bread.  My kids love it too!!  I did 1/2c. applesauce and 1/2c. oil, and it turned out great.  I'll probably use mini-chips next time to spread out the chocolate.

Yum!  I substituted half of the flour with wheat flour - with that and the zucchini I've convinced myself it must be healthy even though it tastes SO good. I made muffins instead of loaves. Can't stop eating them! FYI they freeze great too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good, but took longer to bake in my oven.  Also, be sure to squeeze a fair amount of water out of the zucchini or the bread could be heavy and undercooked in the middle.

I love the flavor of orange and chocolate.  The bread received rave reviews from family members who like zucchini, but those who are skeptics wouldn't try it.  I used the orange glaze another reviewer mentioned, and that just added the final touch.  I ended up freezing the bread into single servings.  It thawed well.  I made one batch of muffins, but they ended up being "too much" bread for a single serving.  Using a loaf pan worked better.

This is a wonderfully moist bread that lends itself to variations.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce in place of all the oil.  Also added chopped pecans.  Next time, I plan to add dried cherries.

I believe I cup the sugar back to 1.5 cups and it was fine. Great recipe, thanks!

It took my breath away! The flavor of this bread is incredible!I did modify it as recommended by using 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 c. vegetable oil (rather thhen the 1 c. oil). The orange glaze on top added that extra zing. Thank you for sharing!

So good!
I used a half of a cup of packed brown sugar, and only a cup of white.
I also used only half of a cup of oil, and used 1/2 of a cup of unsweetened apple sauce.
The batter did not rise very much, which is great because I made half of my batter into muffins and filled them almost to the top.  The muffins took around 20 minutes to bake.  I would recommend using mini-chips because due to the thin batter the regular sized chocolate chips all sank to the bottom.
These are absolutely delicious!  Still high in calories, but at least I feel like I am getting some nutrients from my treats this way!
I am soooo glad my neighbor had too much zucchini!

This is delicious! I used the zest of 2 oranges, which was about the same amount as what the recipe called for, and I liked the amount of orange flavor. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the chocolate chips sank to the bottom. I think I will like it better next time without any chocolate chips, or maybe I'll try the tip from another reviewer of dredging the chips in flour before adding them to the batter.

The best. I use this every fall to make zucchini bread and fill up my freezer with some of the yummiest bread there is. I cannot give this a high enough rating. Our family loves it.  For the past two years I have had no problem figuring out what to do with all that zucchini. *s*

Yummy Yummy! I made this recipe into 24 muffins and topped them with a glaze of orange juice, orange zest and powdered sugar, very nice! The only changes I made were substituting brown sugar for 1/2 of the white sugar (I ran out!), using 1/4 c. of egg substitute for one of the eggs,cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, and used 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for part of the oil. They turned out great and I'd probably use 1/2 c. applesauce next time.

Very good recipe.  I may have baked it too long, I like a more moist bread.  Chocolate chips did not all sink to the bottom in mine.  I also used orange orange flavoring instead of vanilla flavoring.  This is definately a chocolate chip zucchini bread, wonderful to serve at parties, small get togethers, holidays, will make it again, and again.

I substituted 1/4 cup of orange juice for 1/4 cup of the oil, and I used orange extract instead of vanilla. The orange flavor was there, but it was still subtle. Next time I make it, I'll mix the chocolate chips with the dry ingredients to see if it prevents them from settling. I might also try adding some coconut. This recipe is a nice change of pace from other zucchini bread recipes.

I've never had zucchini bread before, that I can recall. Perhaps it is a very good recipe for someone who actually knows, and likes, zucchini bread. I found the recipe's ingredients a little bit of an odd combination from the get go, but was feeling adventurous. To me, the bread tasted as weird as the ingredient list looked. Is it a sweet bread? A spice bread? A vegetable bread? It seemed confused as to what it wanted to be.

It might be an acquired taste, but I won't be making it again to test that theory.

I made this recipe yesterday, with a few changes. I cut the oil to 2/3 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. Just as smoist and a few less calories. Really delicious, though the chocolate chips tended to stay together. Maybe flouring them slightly would help. I had only pecans and they are fine in the bread. The slight taste of orange is really nice with the zucchini.

I am not very good in the kitchen, but I had a lot of fun making this bread with my children. I'm so glad I have a recipe that is fun to make and tastes wonderful. I have more zucchini on the vine and cant wait to make some more. My co-workers loved it too. Thanks so much.

The zucchini provided perfect moistness, the orange and chocolate, together, perfect sweetness, the spices made it a perfect holiday treat, and the 2 cups sugar made the top of the bread sweet and crunchy!

This recipe was really good. I put a little salt on the zucchini, let it sit 10 minutes than sqeezed the water out, it made it much littler. I like it better as muffins it wasn't so dense.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's very filling. I'd like to try what many suggested as to using less oil and use applesauce. I'd definitely make this again as I always enjoy the fresh essence that zests give recipes.

Replaced 1 cup of oil with 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup ground flax seed. Reduced sugar to 1 1/4 cups. Increased zucchini by about 1/2 cup, and it turned out just fine. Much better to our tastebuds this way, and healthier too!

I didn't change a thing and  this bread  tasted wonderful - freezing the extra loafs -- I made one big pan and 2 mini  loafs-
-- its the same recipe  I have been making for 42 years ,but  with  the addition of toasted walnuts, choc chips and orange zest -  we could taste the   orange and was tasty -- loved it !

Good stuff! I made two loaves, both with some modifications. 

Sub coconut oil for veggie oil
A little more zest
Only used baking powder for lack of soda (heaping tsp @ 7000ft)
3/4 cup chocolate
Half an orange's juice
One of them had orange chunks (this one was a little more moist than I would serve in a restaurant, but I still maintain that it tastes better)

Make this if you have tons of extra zukes and you're hankering for the sweet stuff.

I didn't have orange zest, but I subbed some orange/ginger seasoning I had. While it's not dry per se, it's a little dryer than I like my zuchinni bread, next time I'll add an extra cup or so of zuchinni. I also followed some other advice and subbed 1/2 oil with applesauce, and reduced the amount of sugar I used by 1/2 cup. Tastes great, will definitely make again!

So delicious! Used apple sauce instead of oil, 3 cups instead of 2 for zuchinni, 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 1 (lots of batter), and replaced 1 cup of white flour with whole wheat flour. Used orange rind I dried and ground myself. Def a keeper! Made 31 muffins, cooked at 25 min.

Tasty! I used applesauce instead of the oil, and used almond flour and a little ground flax seed in place of about a quarter of the flour. I also added about a cup of extra zucchini so I could use mine up, but I squeezed out the moisture as other reviewers recommended, so it didn't get soggy. I increased the grated orange peel because it sounded so good, but I think it ended up a little too strong, so I'd recommend sticking with the original amount.

I doubled the recipe, and it made two very large loaves and three mini loaves.

I'll definitely be making this again.

I love the combination of orange and chocolate!  The changed I made were:  the cinnamon and nutmeg. However, added 1/2 t. of orange extract. The only other change I made was using coconut oil for the vegetable oil.

I have made this recipe twice since finding it on Sunday!  I made 4 loaves tonight.  I made the recipe as is except no nuts and I added an orange baking emulsion (like an extract) the first time since I didn't have an orange.  I added one teaspoon of vanilla and one of the orange extract.   Tonight I added both the orange extract and the orange peel. It is the best!

Very good recipe! Delicious. ....I used 1/2 - 2/3 c. oil and made up the one cup with chopped up orange which strengthened the orange flavour. Took it to coffee and everyone wanted the recipe and complimeted me on it. Thanks for the great, easy recipe.

I made he recipe just as stated. It was delicious.  It's a joke when I read other reviews that say it's their favorite recipe yet change the entire recipe.  If you can't make it as is then don't rate it. You're rating your own recipe and not the one published.

Very flavorful! I've made many zucchini cake, bread, muffin recipes through the years, this one will certainly be my go-to recipe from now on. I did cut back on the sugar a bit, added a little more cinnamon, and used fresh grated nutmeg. I think the orange zest may be what made it.  The spice flavors together makes this a winner!

Added the zest and juice of one medium orange instead of measuring out the zest, and baked it in one sheet pan until a toothpick came out clean.

This was OK. We thought it was a bit heavy on the nutmeg, which overpowered the other flavors for us. Also, it wasn't as moist as I was hoping (it wasn't DRY, but it wasn't moist either). I may try to play with this again either reducing the nutmeg or omitting it completely b/c I think the idea of using the orange rind and chocolate chips is a great idea, we just couldn't get the full effect of it w/ the nutmeg. Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious!  I have made this twice.  Each time I substituted 1 C. white whole wheat flour for the regular flour, used 1C. brown and 1 C. white sugar, used orange zest from the entire orange and substituted 1 and 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg.  To reduce the fat, I used 1/2 C. apple sauce and the second time I used a ripe banana.  The banana version was sweeter and better!  The next time I make this, I am going to use the dark chocolate chips.  I am using mini loaf pans and giving these as Christmas gifts.  The loaves are done in 40 min.

Delicious - although I would like the orange flavor to come through a bit more (maybe 2 T of orange zest as some other reviewers recommended). I did use less sugar (~1 1/3 cups) and it was still plenty sweet.

My new favorite zucchini bread! I did add a little extra orange zest but made no other changes and it was perfect. Combination of orange and chocolate is delightful.

Love this bread! We make it every fall. If you have someone with an egg allergy, it's super easy to sub out eggs with apple sauce, turns out moist and delicious.

I am always looking for new ways to use zucchini.  I made a number of changes to the recipe, based on what others have said.  I used 1/2 C canola oil; 1/2 C homemade, unsweetened, organic applesauce; 1 C white and 1 Cup brown sugar; 3 T orange zest; 1 teas of cinnamon and omitted the nutmeg and chocolate chips.  I baked it in two 8" square pans for 35 minutes.  I also glazed it with an orange juice glaze made from 4T OJ and 1 cup confectioners sugar.  It was better, more moist, after sitting for a day.  I think I will use all oil for the liquid (to make it even more moist) and add walnuts and raisins the next time I make it.  Yummy!

AMAZING!!! Flavors are wonderful together!! I only had half the amount of zest needed (I doubled the recipe) so I used 1 tsp orange extract to finish it off and it came out great! I did used 60% cocoa chocolate chips (personal favorite). Totally my new favorite zucchini bread recipe! I made two loaves and then a bunch of muffins! My son has already ate 4 muffins (16, football player, he can eat!!) he loved them!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!! Now I need to convert the flavors into a cookie version.... :)

Yummy! I took the suggestion in other comments to make these into muffins..they took out great! (only took about 30 minutes to bake). Very moist and delicious. Made the recipe as written except I ran out of Vanilla extract, so I used Almond extract instead which paired nicely with the orange. Can't wait to make another batch. Good use of an over-abundance of zucchini from the garden. Thanks for posting!

This is really good! I love the unique orange flavor! I added extra zest and a teaspoon orange extract to the mix. I also added about a cup of coconut flakes and used pecans (cuz I had some i needed to use up). Topped with the suggested orange glaze and served cold. Loved it! Keeping this recipe for sure!

Was okay.  Didn't "love" it, but we ate it.  Only wanted to make 1 loaf, so I cut the ingredients in half (used 2 eggs.)  I reduced the sugar and felt this is one of the few recipes that probably needed the full amount.  Could not taste the orange peel, so I'd just leave that out next time. For my oven, baking it 50 minutes made it a little too dry.

I have tried this. I used 1 cup brown + 1/2 cup white sugar to reduce sweetness. I added 2 tbsp freshly squeezed orange juice+ zest of 1 orange. I used 2 round 12 cm dish and one loaf pan 5x9. It has a nice dome shape and taste crunchy on the outside. Yummy..

I've made this recipe for years - it's a Thanksgiving tradition.  I make half the batch with chocolate chips and the other half with fresh cranberries, and I make muffins instead of loaves.  The bread freezes well.

I made this a few days ago.  My mother-in-law and her breakfast crew made short work of it, absolutely LOVED it.  I had to print up several copies of the recipe, the last piece was gone this morning.  Due to popular demand, more is being made today.

Excellent recipe, thanks! I substituted yellow squash for zucchini with no problems. As other reviewers suggested, substituted applesauce for half the oil. I made a batch and a half because that's how much squash I had on hand, and it exactly filled up one muffin tray. In my oven, the muffins were done after 25 minutes.

Love all the flavors and it didn't last long! The only change I made was a little less nutmeg and a little more cinnamon, next time I might try a little more orange zest. But super good the way it is!!

I like the orange-chocolate flavor, but definitely prefer regular zucchini bread if I am going to make zucchini bread. Better to save the orange-choco combo for a different cake altogether.

What an awesome recipe! The only problem with it is that I ate FAR TOO MUCH of it! :) Did drop the oil and sugar by 1/2 a cup each, used chopped dark chocolate dusted in cocoa so it didn't sink, hazelnuts instead of walnuts, and of course did the orange glaze! All I can say is 'WOW!' Going to make it again right now, but into muffins so that I can freeze some and not eat them all!! Thank you!

I made this into muffins - did a mix of white chocolate and milk chocolate chips. I definitely tasted the orange flavor, it was subtle like it should be. They were a little too sweet but my kids certainly didn't complain!

Excellent!  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce instead.  I also exchanged 1 cup all-purpose flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour with no change in flavor or taste.

A very moist, yummy bread. Tried it with dark chocolate chips as well and I think I like that even better. Definitely a keeper recipe and have made this many times.

Amazing! Only changes I made were a bit more cinnamon and omitted the nuts (personal preference). Baked in four mini loafs for 60 min.

Delicious!  I used only half the sugar and whole wheat pastry flour in place of white flour.  Added 1/3 cup flax meal and extra cinnamon. Very moist. Loved this recipe!

Flavorful, moist, and unique.  Next time I will add just a bit more orange zest b/c the orange flavor was more subtle than I wanted it to be.  Also, I used dark chocolate morsels.  The flavor was both nostalgic and elegant....awesome!!

I used the recipe exactly as written and it was very good. Only problem is... a tsp. of nutmeg is WAY too much... it just overpowered the taste of everything else. But other than that, this recipe is a keeper.

This is an incredible recipe.  I made one loaf with chocolate chips and one without.  I preferred the one without the chocolate chips, but both were very good.

Very tasty.  I skipped the walnuts (kids are allergic) and the orange zest (never liked that taste).  Next time I'll cut back a bit on the nutmeg.

I don't really care for chocolate with spices, but thought the orange might make a difference. Unfortunately, I used dried orange peel which was totally tasteless. I would not make this again with the semisweet chocolate, but I plan to try this with the white chips suggested by another reviewer, and definitely using fresh orange peel.

When my in-laws gave us some zucchini from their garden, I searched for a recipe that would be fun and yummy for our 4 children.  I wanted to prove to them how great using items from the garden could be.  This recipe is fabulous!  Everyone loved it.  It's moist and delicious and quite a treat.  I made a loaf for my in-laws and they loved it, too!

Yum!  This bread came out incredibly moist.  I omitted the walnuts and finished the bread with the orange glaze recommended in previous reviews.  I also opted for mini chocolate chips; they were well distributed throughout the bread.  This one is going in my rotation for sure!  It did take longer than the suggested bake time to set, but it was well worth it.

My kids and I made this recipe together, my neighbor happened to be here to, he called 3 times to see if it was done yet.  After taste testing he took off with 1/2 of one loaf then came back for more later.  I think we all liked it..ya think??!!

Everyone loved this recipe.  It was a big hit at our last family gathering. Very easy to fix and no one even guessed it had zucchini in it. It was great!!!!!!
