I added some extra spices (garlic powder, onion powder, Cajun seasoning, garlic salt and some seasoned salt) and increased the oil slightly.  I put the oil and seasonings in a large plastic bag with the potato wedges and tossed them in the bag.  It worked very well!

These were great! I put them in at 350 because I was cooking chicken at that temp., it didn't really make a difference except that they took a little longer. One note, try not to get the extra oil onto the cookie sheet, I dumped the fries onto the cookie sheet when they were all coated and the fries that were sitting in more oil weren't as good as the others.

Needed a bit more olive oil; added some garlic as well as rosemary. Just a little too plain for me otherwise.

Made these with yukon gold potatoes & they were a hit.  I added more seasonings: onion powder, paprika, parsley, garlic powder etc and cut them into thinner pieces.  I baked them at 400 until for about 45 minutes, until they were crispy.A healthy way to eat "fries."

This is much easier & healthier than fried potatoes.  I like to play around with different spices and seasonings- Italian, Cajun, or any other combination.  I always add garlic powder and paprika to make them brown more evenly.

We had some friends over last night and I made these to go with some burgers on the grill. I didn't have any because by the time I got to eat they were gone.I heard they were awesome though.

Pretty good! I have to cook mine a little longer to get them crispier.  I also added a little more salt.

I was looking for something perfectly simple- this was it! I didn't have noodles to compliment Beef Burgandy III so I made these.  I was looking for a roasted NOT elaborate in the spice department potatoe that would not take away from the savory flavor of the beef.  This was it!  I made as the recipe states except I doubled the olive oil, cut the potatoes into a cube and cooked at 350 for 50 minutes in a casserole dish.

Healthy and much tastier alternative to deep fried potatoes.  Also a better choice that store-bought frozen fries.  Used with a Philly Steak Salad recipe from this site.

Stopped using the frozen fries because of the chemicals put on them, and the same with fast-food fries. These are delicious, and because I know exactly what is on them, more healthy eating.

These are great. Simple, quick, and quite tasty. Just make sure to keep them about 1/2 inch thick or they'll be too mushy.

These are a great basic fry recipe. The herbs and seasonings can easily be changed/varied depending on what flavors that you want.

Instead of baking potatos, I used fingerling potatoes in a trio of colors (red, yellow, and purple).

Great basic recipe to start with!

These fries were great! I changed a couple things: I used a a 1/4 TBSP more oil and also added about a tablespoon of garlic. When I cooked them we were also making ribs, so they had to go in on the bottom rack. I cooked them for about 15 mins the first time and 8 mins after flipping them and they turned out nice and crispy! Thank you for this recipe!

The advice to use a bag to toss the oil and spices with the potatoes was very helpful as well :)

Wonderful!  I used Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced them into my fries and let them hang out under the running faucet to remove some of the starch.  I towel dried them, then put them in a bowl with a bit more of the specified ingredients than suggested and tossed with my hands.  Ended up leaving them in the oven just a bit longer than recommended (I was grilling, too) and they ended up perfectly crisp - especially when I let them sit for a few minutes before serving.

We make these with the little round canned potatoes.  They are always a hit at our holiday get togethers.  We don't measure the amounts but all the ingredients are the same except we add a little butter to the tops of the potatoes.

So, so, so, so, so easy and equally delicious. I used garlic salt and seasoning salt instead of the cayenne, etc. My boyfriend keeps asking "are you SURE these are healthy???"

I made this recipe today for dinner. I followed the recipe, but I did add garlic powder, onion powder, and cajun seasoning. The fries turned out just right, tasty with a nice crunchiness.  I will definitely make these again.

These are yummy!  I use 3/4 tsp. Kosher salt instead of regular salt and it tastes even better to me.  Be sure and taste test the oil before tossing the potatoes in it to be sure that the seasoning is to your liking.  We gobble these up every time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mixed it all in a gallon bag (to avoid mess like someone else suggested),  added just a little rosemary, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and cooked it on foil on the cookie sheet (again to avoid mess).

These were very good.  I cut the potatoes into little bite-sized pieces.  I then added garlic and onion powder, seasoning salt instead of regular and about a teaspoon and a half of Cajun seasoning.  Also, I didn't bother to flip them.  I cooked them until they were just about done and then I turned on the broiler for a few minutes.  They were crisp, a little bit spicy and full of flavor.  My oldest son is really picky about potatoes and he ate three helpings of these!

So easy, and you can put whatever spices you like.  I used garlic and onion powders and a little oregano too.  I also cut the potatoes smaller so they would cook faster.  By cutting them in about half the size I took 10 min off the cooking time and they came out nice and crispy.

These were very good! Much healthier than frying them. I used more spice and they were perfectly seasoned. Perfect late night snack.

These were super tasty.  My family gobbled them up. I tried another microwave recipe and it left them soggy and the coating made them taste like shake and bake wedges. These were perfect!

Tried this for the first time.  Good change from oily fries.  I cut each potato into 12 wedges to make thinner.  They turned out good.  Thanks for recipe.
