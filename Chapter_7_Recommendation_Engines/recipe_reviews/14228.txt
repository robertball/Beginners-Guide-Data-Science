Come on people!Doesn't anybody taste the dishes they make before they serve them?!I'm so tired of people giving a recipe a bad review because it didn't have enough flavor,salt,spice etc.Adding more flavor is about the easiest change you can make to a recipe.Make it,taste it,if it needs something more for your taste,add it!Everyone's taste is different~think for yourselves!Don't blindly follow a recipe that was made to a different persons idea of flavorful!
 That said~this was a great start and a great recipe once I personalized the flavor level.I added more lime,mustard,garlic,salt and pepper,and used 1Tbs veg. oil and 1Tbs peanut oil.I also used Yukon Gold potatoes because I like their texture more than Russet's.Great looking,great tasting,great texture! Enough said!

5 stars only for Great recipes -- this one deserves it!  Don't be put off by negative reviews... some people just don't get it.  This is NOT a potluck item or the deli slop you get at the supermarket; it's designed to be featured in a menu of complementary dishes.  I continued the Caribbean theme and grilled jerk chicken (Jay's), accompanied with a spicy mango salsa (both recipes on this website) and rice.

As with all dishes calling for produce or herbs, freshness is key! -- most ingredients were purchased the same day at a farmer's market.  Used Yukon potatoes and fresh sweet corn sliced from the cob.  Cucumbers add an unexpected freshness and texture.  After a decade of cilantro overkill, this dished utilized it for maximum definition.  The dressing was wonderful; just added a little extra lime for zip.

Will be using this dish repeatedly -- especially at potlucks where previous reviewers will leave it for me to take home and devour!

Loved this. I made it for a gathering and everyone loved it! 
I used parsley instead of cilantro...only because I goofed when I bought it, but I'm not a big fan of cilantro so it worked out for me! 
I also doubled the entire dressing part of the recipe and used about 2/3 of the amount of the dressing I made. 
I bought two medium russet potatoes because they didn't have the giant ones, also bought a yam (or so it was labled - I don't really know the difference). 
Also, I cooked the potatoes the day before, dunked them in ice water after cooking (as stated) and then sealed them a plastic container in the fridge. I think this really helps set the potatoes so that they don't fall apart. I also made the dressing the day before and I think that helped meld the flavors. 
I mixed the solid ingredients at home before taking to the outing and I put the dressing on at the VERY LAST minute right before serving.

This is a unique recipe for a different potato salad.  For Weight Watchers -- it has 4 points per serving.  I cooked white and sweet potatoes together and tested their doneness at intervals.  Added frozen corn at last minute.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add some curry powder --- made all the difference in the world....picked up the flavors of sweet potatoes, as well as other vegetables.  I will be making this recipe for a long time.

I made this on Sunday and it was really good. The only change I made was to cut back on the oil a bit. I made it a day in advance as I wasn't going to have time on Monday to make this. Big mistake. I don't know quite what happened, but on Monday this tasted really different. The cucumber had shed a lot of water so it was watery and bland and not very appetizing. I am going to try and salvage this tonight, somehow but if you do decide to make this.. make it on the same day you are planning on serving it. letting this sit overnight like some salads does not improve the flavor. I didn't add the nuts until I was ready to serve so those were kept crunchy.

This salad was cool and delicious. The only problem was that I made it in the morning for dinner that evening and couldn't get out of taste testing mode. Almost didn't have enough for dinner! I did use extra lime juice, cut fresh corn off the cob (super easy and it doesn't get mushy like canned), and used a seedless cucumber. Don't let the unusual ingredients scare you away. They really make the salad.

OOOOH, YUMMY! This was delicious! We used twice the amount of potatoes, and used half of the oil called for. The amount of dressing was perfectly preportioned to the salad. The combination of sweet, tangy, and nutty was fabulous. We'll make this again (and it's pretty too!)

This recipe is fantastic, a refreshing change to your typical sweet potato dish. I used extra lime juice and used regular mustard with honey rather than dijon and it was gobbled up in no time!

I felt this is served best at room temperature and don't add the nuts and cucumber until serving time to preven them from going soggy.

A must try! I have been making potato salads for years, and this one is tops. For probably the first time in my cooking career I did NOT change or add anything to a recipe. It's perfect just the way it is! I love the contrasting textures and flavors, and friends commented on the beautiful presentation. Thank you.

Excellent!  I used a little less oil to cut down the fat..and it was fantastic.  Served this with jerk chicken and mango salsa.  Will make this potato salad again!

There was a poster in my doctor's office that showed recommended healthy foods and the sweet potato was on it and I've been looking for recipes that aren't sweet (candied) versions so I was excited to try this recipe. I'll be making this again for sure. I had pastachios on hand so I used them instead of peanuts. I added a touch more cilantro too. Great recipe- I like how all of the flavors pop out as you chew, the onion, cucumber, cilantro. Mmmm. This would be a great side at a bbq. Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe and will definately make again.  I've made it 3 times already.  I did not add the corn the first time.  It adds an extra sweetness that the salad is lacking if you don't put it in.  I used whole mustard all three times- my preference and I think it was great.  The only other thing I've added to the recipe that it did not call for is some ground red pepper (1/3 tsp).  The first two times it seemed to need a little more zing so I added the red pepper for a little zing.  That's what it was missing to make a perfect salad for me- the red pepper balances the sweet ingredients in the recipe.  The peanuts add a lot to the recipe.  If you make it without the peanuts please note that you are reviewing a completely different tasting dish when you leave out the peanuts (and actually any other ingredients).  It's a 5 * when I added the red pepper. But it was great enough exactly as is that I made it 3 times so just that gives it a 5 * as well.

If you're short on time andor ingredients, I recommend Newman's Own Parisienne Dijon Lime Salad Dressing. It's a great substitute!

This was a fantastic change of pace for the everyday ho-hum version of potato salad.  I'm so tired of making it the way my mom makes it (not that there's anything wrong with it, Mom!).  This is like an explosion of flavors.  The sweet potatos and lime based dressing really make this dish.  It was easy to prepare and a big hit!  Definitely one of my new favorites.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but agree with another reviewer that it needs some adjustments.  I used a Yukon; as another reviewer suggested, and I thought the texture was a little too soft.  I only used 1 T of cilantro (my herb garden in waining!)and I will use the 3 suggested next time.  I think the peanuts are a great idea for texture, but not quite the right taste.  Might almonds, walnuts, or even cashews be better?  Definately taste before serving........I bumped up the salt and pepper.  I thought the onion added a much needed zing, and might even add just a touch of cayenne to the vinegarette next time.  I know this sounds like I have torn apart the recipe, but I do like the idea of a creative and mayo-less potato salad, and I will make this again!

I brought this to my family reunion pot luck dinner and got rave reviews from those in my family with less traditional tastes!!! Like one reviewer wrote its not your typical potato salad, but then again its NOT suppose to be. Its delicious and different and thats why I and others appreciated it and liked it. Next time I would even try it with all sweet potatoes as they were soooo delicious with the combo of other ingredients. T
he dressing was awesome.

Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I thought this recipe was terrible.  It doesn't make nearly enough dressing for the salad, is time-consuming to make, and tastes rather bland.

Looks great but the dressing is missing a little something - I'll play with it and give it a little kick next time - maybe some Ginger or a Fruit Based Hot Sauce.

This recipe is the greatest.  I cant stop thinking about it.  The people that said this doesnt taste good or it takes too long to make are crazy.  I put in more mustard than the recipe said -- how could you even taste 1 teaspoon of mustard in with all that salad?  I used like 2 tablespoons of mustard, and it had a pretty good flavour but not too overpowering.  Also, I think it calls for the juice of an entire lime.  Dont waste your time measuring out the juice from your limes.  Just squeeze it all in there!  Also, when I made it I forgot the peanuts, but I'm sure that will be an interesting twist the next time I make it!

Excellent salad.  It will be one that you take to family gatherings.  One suggestion that I found makes thing a whole lot simplier is if you cook the sweet and white potatos in their own pots.  The cooking times are so different.  The first time I made this recipe I over cooked the white potatos.

A delicious potato salad; much better than mayo-based salads.  I would suggest using a Yukon Gold potato instead of the russet; better texture and flavor.  I will make this again and my guests loved it too.

This recipe is awesome...substituted pecans for the peanuts, yams instead of russet potatoes, peas instead of corn, and olive oil (1/2 to 2/3 the called for amount) in place of canola oil. Vegan, vegetarian, healthy, whatever...this dish was tasty!!

This salad is always a big hit!  I double it and use all sweet potatoes (usually 5 medium sized).  I slice a large red onion as thinly as possible- it is great for flavor and texture in this dish.  I also   halve and de-seed the cucumbers before slicing.  Leaving the seeds in the cucs would water-down the salad a lot, especially it you are making it a day ahead.  Cooking the potatoes to the proper consistency is most important: I cut the potatoes before I boil and cook just until the potato can be cut with a fork and then blanch in cold water. I mix in the dressing and let it refrigerate overnight.  This isn't necessary, but I like how the flavors mellow and meld together overnight.  I find the amount of dressing to be perfect, but I make a little extra to add right before serving and grind on some sea salt and black pepper.  If I was making this just for myself, I would also add some freshly ground red pepper flake, but not everyone likes spice, so I leave it out.  A wonderful, refreshing dish for BBQs, picnics and parties. I love it and make it all year long!

A very delightful recipe. i didn't realize that it didn't ask for mayonnaise and it tasted great without it. However, we were in the mood for a mayonnaise based potato salad, so I added 1/2 cup and it tasted wonderful with it too! I omitted the onions. Wonderful recipe, will make again.

Very Good! A great change from your typical potato salad. Found myself having to make more of the dressing and adding more of each flavorful ingredient in order to give the whole thing a stronger taste.

I would never consider this a substitute for regular potato salad.  This might be a good side dish for an open minded group, but even the most adventurous eaters at our gathering weren't impressed with the very different flavor.  Sorry.

I made this tonight -- just as written, and served it with grilled salmon.  It was fabulous!  It would also be great with just white potatoes, or just sweet potatoes.  What a great accompaniment to grilled foods.  I am always looking for good, different salads and this one is definitely a keeper!

I enjoyed this salad, as did my sister, but my husband did not. He was expecting a more traditional potato salad. I liked the dressing so much that I made it a couple of days later just to put on a tossed green salad. Yummy!

delightful salad that I will serve again. This recipe is much lighter than a mayonnaise based potato salad and much more flavorful.

This was a nice change from the mayo based potato salad.  Nice flavors that everyone enjoyed.  Will make again.  I made as written.  Next time though I will cook my potatoes less than they say as they did get a bit mushy.  I just need to watch them closer.

I doubled the recipe except for the cucumber, because I only had one, and put in some chopped celery.  The dressing seemed too limey to me so I added a small blob of mayonnaise and about a tablespoon of sugar, which did the trick.  I really liked this, but my husband, who generally likes just about everything didn't care much for it.  He expects his potato salad to have white potatoes, hard boiled egg, and a rich mayonnaise dressing, like his mom used to make.  Now I'm sorry I doubled the recipe.  Thanks, though, I thought it was tasty.

This potato salad is beautiful and delicious.  I assembled the night BEFORE the party and found the next day, I needed a smidge more dressing.  On the second day dressing, I used only lime juice, mustard, s&p and a few drops of oil... This was excellent.  I used salted crushed peanuts and it made all the difference (without it, I would have had to add more salt to the salad).  I have to admit, this was the prettiest dish on the table! And although I doubled the recipe, this was the first bowl emptied!  Great summer recipe!

As with any recipe: read the reviews first for advice and tweaking, and then make it your own. Before bashing a posted recipe, understand that cooking isn't always an exact science, it's food. And everyone likes different things. This is the only sweet potato salad I've ever tried/made that was so creative with such a unique taste. I brought it to a potluck myself, and everyone loved it. The only thing I would have changed would to use salted peanuts instead of dry-roasted because I didn't add that much salt to begin with. Also, I cut the onion in half and minced it well. I didn't get the chance to use fresh corn, I used canned, and it was STILL amazing. Definitely a keeper!

I LOVE sweet potatoes, so I was anxious to make this recipe.  I turned out excellent!  I did make a couple of changes, though.  I used 2 sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, and I omitted the onion, cucumber and nuts.  I also added about 1 Tbl of honey to the dressing.  Even my husband thought it was great!  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was very  good and interesting. I used olive oil instead of canola, and raw, fresh corn. I also used one yellow and one orange sweet potato (no white potatoes), and it wasn't too sweet at all. The potatoes definitely needed to cook longer, though. The softer pieces had a nice texture and were a smooth contrast with the crispness of the raw corn and cucumbers (which I seeded). Surprisingly, though, this salad was best on the first night.

Fantastic - had 12 people ask for the recipe.  I do not know what salad those of you who complained had made. If you do not know how to cook a potato, I can see where there may be a problem otherwise this is easy!!  I used all sweet potatoes and no peanuts.  One of the best salads ever.

I love this salad!  I leave out the peanuts and add pine nuts due to an allergy, but is works well without them too.  I also omit the cucumber, just cuz it seems out of place.  I add black beans, yummy!  Thanks for this recipe!!

This is tasty, but I'd sub celery for cucumbers next time - the cucumbers were weird. The dressing is great though. I might also add pickles next time

Took this to a bbq last night, and it flopped.  Not necessarily because of the flavor, but because only 2 people tried it (myself included).  I thought it was *ok* but not great, and won't be making it again.

I reallly liked this!! And I was suprised that the kiddos and the hubby did too, considering they only seem to eat chicken and pb&j sandwiches. I made this for the cookout I am attending tonight, but I had to sample it of course and I let the family tsate it too. I added a lot more garlic, salt, pepper and mustard because I like my food with a ton of seasoning.I also used Yukon GOlds. YUM!

It was so delicious! I used olive oil instead of canola, and I also added an extra half tsp of dijon mustard. 

Next time I think I'll use a bigger sweet potato and smaller white potato. Loved it.

This was just fabulous.  Instead of boiling the potatoes, I cut them up (used 1 white and 2 sweet) in bite-sized chunks, put them in one layer in a glass casserole dish, covered with water and microwaved for 8 minutes.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was even better than I had hoped!

Great texture, beautiful colors, and wonderful flavors...this potato salad has it all. I was curious about the combination of mustard, cilantro and peanuts since they are all strong. The result is really sensational. Give this a try for a really different change from run of the mill potato salad.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  Oh, and did I mention that it is yummy?  I made this last night to have for dinner tonight and almost ate the entire bowel last night.  I was concerned that there was not enough dressing, but it is just the right amount.  I held back half the onions also and used can corn and it was still great.  What I love is that you can taste each ingredient without being overpowered by the dressing!!!  And I have to admit I LOVE anything with cilantro!!!!  Perfect for Florida and the dog days of summer!!!  Thank you for sharing this!!!

I really wanted to LOVE this--and it was very tasty--but it lacked zing. One thing, for sure, is that it needs more salt than what's in the potato-boiling water. It would also benefit from a little more lime juice. Even still, I will most definitely make this again because it was still a tasty potato salad with beautiful preentation. I'll just try to doctor it a bit more!

This is now my favorite potato salad.  Goes great with Carribean Jerk Chicken on the BBQ and mango salsa also found on this site.  Highly recommended for BBQ/picnic get togethers- it gets raves every time.  I usually use a few red or new potatoes as a personal preference.  Russetts can get a little soft.  I also leave out the peanuts and the recipe is still wonderful.

Did exactly what the recipe had said, same measurments of everything, it wasn't all I thought it would be, we ate some for dinner, then it sat in the fridge untouched for 3 days, needless to say it went down the garbage disposal.

i thought this was pretty tasty, but my family didn't really know what to think of it. they barely touched it.  I added honey - and lots of it- to the dressing. The mustard overpowered it, and I would not add it again. I also added some cinammon and allspice to sweeten it a bit.  The cilantro put it over the top for me. I didn't use the peanuts. And the onion might give you heartburn if you use all of it, so soak it in water beforehand.

A great alternative to the regular potato salad.  I skipped the peanuts and didn't miss them.  I would recommend placing this in the fridge before serving.  Probably even better after sitting overnight.  I could have even used a stronger flavor and will probably add more of the dressing next time.

Cooking time for russet potatoes WAY too long.  I thought it was too long but did it anyway, and they turned to mush, so I had to start over with the russets.  I would cook the russets and sweets together for no more than 15 minutes total time.  It's an interesting recipe.

I thought this was a really good recipe.  I do not like mayo-based salads so this was a great potato salad.  Nice flavor and goes very well with a Caribbean-themed menu as other reviewers have mentioned.  I will make this again, especially since I overcooked the sweet potatoes just a bit the first time.

Served this at our housewarming party and I got tons of compliments on it. It's colorful, has lots of taste and different textures. Not your typical potato salad -- definitely improved and healthier.

I thought that this recipe was terrible, which really surprised me after reading the other reviews. Made it for a potluck...it was a ton of work, and the taste was so average that I did not even take it to the potluck.

super fantastic.   The only change I will make next time is making the potatoes in two separate pots.  My russets were getting a bit mushy and the sweet weren't quite done yet

This was a really nice salad with a twist for my Jamaican dinner for 50. Very interesting combination of sweet potatoes, corn, cucumbers, etc. the funny thing is that some people were turning their nose up at first but when they tried it they loved it and went back for seconds. One of the keys to this is to make sure you don't over cook the vegetables. make sure to pull the sweet potatoes and potatoes off the burner as soon as you stick a fork in them and it slides out easily. this was even better the second day with all of the juices mixing together. very interesting and fun and enjoyed by all. thank you!

This recipes was GREAT... I messed around with the ingredients a lil... I had a can of drained and rinsed black beans (for protein) and I used olive oil instead of canola. Excellent dinner. I recommend serving room temp. (you can taste more of the flavors that way).

Very good.  I added more cilantro and lime as recommended and it has a little kick but not too much.  The sweet potato softens the blow.  Impressive.

I had to jump up mid-meal to write a rave review of this salad!  I was looking for a side dish for a Caribbean entree but it completely stole the show.  What a great blend of flavors!  My dinner companion and I both had multiple servings and left the entree barely touched!  Easy peasy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I was using leftover sweet corn that I cut off the cob, so I didn't bother recooking it.  I shared this one on Facebook and can't wait to make it for family again this weekend.

Excellent. This was a nice change from a mayanaise potato salad.  I chilled the potatos prior to slicing and topped it with slices of avacodo.

I've just made this recipe for the first time. It is delicious and well worth repeating. For a start, it contains ALL my favourite ingredients and the tangy freshness of line juice with the sweetness of the potato is delightful. I didn't have any peanuts in the storecupboard so I used 2 tsps of crunchy peanut butter which I beat into the limejuice.It was good, but I think peanuts would have been better. Many thanks to you, Jessica, for this hugely tasty dish!

I thought this would be unusual, but I was so impressed.  It was incredibly flavorful and the peanuts turned out to be a nice surprise.  I thought the dressing tasted too tart and overpowering by itself, but once mixed with the rest of the ingredients, it toned down and was perfect.  It tasted great the next day.  The cucumbers still had crunch, but were more "marinated".  I loved the sweet potatoes, but my husband liked the white potatoes better - so there is something for everyone.  I made it with a carribean papaya marinated flank steak. I will make this again and again!

This was great!  I used 2 yukon gold and 2 sweet potatos and it made a ton!  I boiled them in separate saucepans, the yukon gold for about 10 minutes and the sweet potatos for about 15 minutes.  For the dressing I doubled the lime juice, garlic, and dijon and used olive oil instead of canola oil (didn't double that).  It was plenty to cover the extra potatoes.  I served this chilled, letting it sit for about 2 hours before we ate it.  High prise all around.  The corn adds a nice sweet touch.

Very good--I added a little cayenne pepper to give it a little zip, and a little vinegar as well.  I used a yam instead of a sweet potato, and definitely use sweet potatoes because yams get too soft and make the whole thing kinda mushy.  I love the blend of textures and tastes, though. I might use more lime and garlic next time.

I cooked the two kinds of potatoes separately, and this worked out well.  I cut fresh sweet corn from the cob instead of using frozen.  I seeded and diced up the cucumber, and I didn't add the peanuts because I didn't have any.  This is delicious and it had plenty of sauce, the only thing I would change is to just use all sweet potatoes instead of half white and half sweet.  It was very fresh-tasting, even the next day, and it's healthy.  Served with the Jamaican Jerked Chicken and Mango Salsa from this site.  Very nice meal on a summer day!

YUM!!! This is amazing!  To begin with I couldn't really imagine how these flavors would come together, but they work wonderfully together. I made some modifications based on other reviews and personal preferences. For starters, I used yukon gold potatoes and yams and I cooked them in separate pots. For the dressing, I used 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of olive oil instead of 3 tablespoons of canola (just don't like canola oil.) I added a bit of extra lime juice to replace the other tablespoon of oil and I used bold and spicy mustard. Also, I used celery instead of cucumber (just happened to have it in the fridge), only used 1/4 cup of chopped red onion and forgot to add the corn! I was going to use a can of corn instead of fresh and just forgot all about it.  The recipe turned out amazing regardless! I will be making it again and again.

This is a delicious, fun, and funky summer salad.  You have to double it, because you are going to want extras, and it's almost too much work for just a small amount.  The cooking instructions for the potatoes are a bit cumbersome, but clearly designed with keeping dishes low.  I just cook them all separately - the corn in the microwave, boil the white potato, and steam the sweet potato (boiled sweet potatoes can get waterlogged).  Of course, then I have 2 big pots dirty, but whatever.  It's a totally great recipe.

I used all sweet potatoes.  I loved this recipes and so have my friends.  It was a big hit.  Cooking time for the potatoes is very important.  I will make this again and again.  I leave out the nuts for those with nut allergies.

I did not care for this salad - it tasted bland, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  There was not enough of the dressing to cover/mix with the potatoes, so they were dry, and I only used one potato of each kind.  Sorry, but we threw the whole batch out, it just didn't taste good.

Light and cool - perfect for a barbeque/picnic when you don't want to deal with the mayonnaise of regular potato salad.  I didn't have cucumber on hand, but celery worked splendidly. :)

The best thing about this potato salad is that it looks nice.  I served this at a picnic today and had several people inquire about it before we ate and no one comment on it after that.  It was rather bland and nothing special.  The recipe is going the same place the leftovers did - in the trash!

Very unusual and delicious!  I skipped the cukes and added a little extra lime juice and oil to the dressing.  I'll make this one again.

I used this recipe in a catered luncheon I was doing.  Everyone just went crazy over it and wanted the recipe.  After I had finished preparing it, my husband found it in the fridge and was upset that it wasn't for him.  I gave him a taste after the luncheon, and he thought it was wonderful.  The aroma just makes your mouth water!

I was pleasantly surprised when my husband and I made this for the first time.  It was Passover and we needed something new to do with our sweet potatoes.  Delicious, addictive potato salad, that lends itself easily to some adaptations.  To make prep easier, we chopped up the sweet potatoes and then microwaved them (took less than ten minutes).  Modifications we made: we used two sweet potatoes only, didn't have any cilantro, used only 2Tbl of olive oil (which was plenty), chopped celery instead of cucumber, and less red onion (eye-ball it to personal taste, we used about 1/4-1/3 cup).  The crushed peanuts really added a lot, so don't skip them if possible.  We will certainly make this again!

My young girls and I offer modifications that will thus perfect the salad for our family. Half the cucumber and smaller pieces, 1/4th onion, double white potatoes thus equalling perfection! A delicious lightly sweetened alternative to the heavier regular potato salad.

The recipie was delicious as is but I tried a variation to suit my taste. Omitted the corn but added chunks of pineapple and cashews for peanuts.  Cooked potatoes the night before but mixed in dressing right before the barbecue and added nuts at the last minute. Play around with the seasoning a bit (I added a spritz of Siracha to the dressing to kick it up). I would think with the pineapple shredded coconut might be a nice addition as well.

Great fun twist on potato salad. I think next time that I will add some black olives or kalamata olives for some extra zing. It was better after it sat for a while as well.

I took this to a potluck, and was unsure if it would go well bc sometimes sweet potatoes are a little scary for some people. Everyone loved it and gobbled it all up!! The only things I changed: I added plenty of salt (like 3x as much as I would normally add to a recipe bc the potatoes soak up so much), added a couple extra teaspoons of dijon mustard, reduced the oil by about half, and next time I think I'll throw in a boiled egg. I liked the sweet potatoes better, but my husband liked the white potatoes better...so I guess it's just a preference thing but this has them both.  Will be making on a regular basis from now on. Thank you!

This was great!  The recipe has a mild sweetness of its own due to the sweet potatoes.  I didn't have cukes, or peanuts, so I left those out, but added some chopped walnuts instead.  I also used olive oil instead of canola, used some of the lime zest for some extra lime flavor, and added some chopped jalenos for a little extra kick.  It is really different and tasty.  I will make this again!

We loved it! I didn't have cilantro on hand - thought I did, but was mistaken. So I used green onions instead.  Also, I cooked 3 pcs of bacon and crunched up over it instead of the peanuts.  It was yuumy!

Delicious. I had to make one change. Since I am unable to have nuts, I tossed in Chick Peas in place of the nuts. That is not due to the fault of the recipe. I would've loved to have the nuts.

I just served this with a grilled pork loin on a very hot evening and it was perfect.  I scooped the seeds out of the cucumber before I chopped it, I think that help keep it from watering the salad down.  I also used peeled Yukon Golds. I am not a cilantro fan, but it was needed in this and the taste is not overpowering.  I did all the prep. the day before, then a couple of hours before serving I put all of the components together to let the flavors meld.  It tasted very fresh, but the potato had a chance to absorb some of the dressing flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe, very tasty. I did not have all the ingredients so I had to substitute. I substituted the canola oil with olive oil and I did not have peanuts but I had crushed almonds. I recommend it. I will be making this quite often.

This is AWESOME!!!!!  What a great side dish for chicken, pork or fish.  This dish has so much flavor and is really easy to prepare.  I brought this to a BBQ and 10 people asked for the recipe!  Don't go by the negatives reviews on this dish, try it for yourself!!!

Fabulous!! This is such a delicious, unusual salad - a perfect compliment to anything spicy. I pretty much doubled the dressing because the potatoes just soak it up. Also, we added extra lime juice and more peanuts (they just give it a great rich flavor)AND some fresh chopped jicama for crunch and sweetness! Thanks for the recipe, we will make it again, for sure!!!

LOVE IT.. My husband and I fell in love with this.. I replaced cilantro for parsley as I'm not a big fan of cilantro.. I also used 2 tbsp of olive oil and one tbsp vegatable oil.. Turned out GREAT.. A definite keeper..

This a wonderful recipe! After reading the other reviews I, as many already have, altered a few things which I think make it taste even better! I used far more potatoes than called for as I assumed that two large potatoes would be less than sufficient in feeding a large group of people. Secondly, I added about three TBSP's of curry powder and honey. I also doubled all the other dressing ingredients. This made an AWESOME dressing! I will definitely make it again and have to say that the curry made all the difference for me...if you like that sorta thing ;)

We made this salad without the sweet potatoes for our guests, but even without it was great.  The cucumbers add a nice cool crunch to the salad and the dressing is yummy!  Next time we make it, I'll make sure to include the sweet potatoes...delish!

While I changed quite a few of the ingredients for this recipe (used only sweet potatoes and omitted cucumber), the recipe actually turned out very well. The dressing was fantastic and a good alternative to mayo-based dressings.

This is a great, healthier alternative to a classic comfort food. I didn't have any corn on hand, so I used freshly grilled orange bell peppers instead.  It turned out great!

Easy to make, Took it a BBQ and everyone loved it.  Didn't miss the normal Mayo version at all.  The potatoes break down just enough to make it creamy.

This was really good.  I served it at a bbq last night with black bean salad and Jay's jerk chicken (both from allrecipes).  One guest who doesn't normally like potato salad came back for a second helping.  It was a big hit.

I really liked this recipe. I brought it to a bbq potluck and unfortunately I ended up taking quite a bit home. It could be because my local store was out of sweet potatoes and so I used yams instead which made the dish really colorful, but the yams probably scared people away. Also, my dish was sitting next to a traditional pasta salad and everyone just got done bike racing so they went for what was most familiar. Despite the lack of enthusiasm from bbq-ers, I loved this dish and would most certainly make it again. Also, the cilantro-mustard sauce was awesome and I think it would go well on lettuce salad, chicken or fish.

The sweet potatoes and russet potatoes took way too long to cook 
and still didn't cook evenly.  The dressing is great, though!

This recipe is a great "warm weather" salad. It's different and tends to be more impressive than the traditional potato salad at parties and BBQ's. I made it for a pot lock BBQ and already have to send it to everyone who tried it. Great mix of ingredients. They really compliment each other.

This recipe sounded good, and a change from your regular Potatoe Salad.  The time that it takes to make it is totally misrepresented, Hey it took forever just to chop the cilantro and then the cucumbers and then to peel the potatoes and to cut the corn off the cob  before...how can you say the prep time is so short?  The taste was ok...it was different.  I took it to a Ladies Club Salad luncheon, I have ALOT left over.

used kiwi, chicken and pecans instead of corn, cukes and peanuts.  Great flavor combo with the lime dressing. I'm sure the original would have been good too but I didn't have those ingredients.

I love this recipe!  It's now my go-to for barbecues - flavorful, perfect for the summer, and no mayonaise.  It's always a hit and the simple ingredient list makes it easy to whip up in a pinch.

This was good, but not spectacular, so I only gave it 4 stars. I used just sweet potatoes and they were both large. I am not sure if perhaps they soaked up all the dressing, but the salad seemed to need more dressing, or more of a kick. I will make it again and use smaller potatoes, and maybe double the dressing?

This was good!  I boiled and cut the potatoes ahead of time and then added everything together right before serving.  Everyone really liked it.  I only give it four because nobody at the dinner table said it was "fantastic" including me.  But it was good and I love sweet potatoes!

This is by far one of the best recipes I have ever tried from allrecipes. No changes needed. I was looking for a cool summer salad that incorporated sweet potatos and hit the nail straight on with this scrumption version. The combination of flavor is addictive to say the least. Once you start eating this, it is hard to stop. I haven't served this once without having to produce the recipe!!!

This is a refreshing salad.  I didn't have only half the lime juice, but it turned out okay.  Be careful not to overcook the potatoes and definitily put in fridge overnight.  Hard to measure potato size so just add potatoes to taste.  You don't want them too dry.

This is so interesting, both my husband and I were a little nervous to try this but it is really good with all of the different flavors and textures. I used a yukon gold potato and one very large sweet potato. I used parsley instead of cilantro since I hate cilantro entirely. Other than that, followed the recipe, let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours and was pleasantly surprised! Will make this alot in the summer.

Penny P says: This was a lot of work to prepare, but the results were definitely worth it. I added a few extra cloves of crushed fresh garlic to this (about 4 total)which gave it a great kick and a wonderful aroma. I made this for a BBQ with some other side dishes, and this was the one dish that everyone finished. I got lots of compliments on this one. It's also really colorful and looks nice on the table. The different textures in the ingredients are what made this so unique and delicious. NOTE--I tripled this recipe and it came out fantastic.

My super picky husband loved this recipe and kept stealing spoonfulls before dinner!  I didn't have Dijon mustard so used regular yellow instead and it still tasted yummy.  I also omitted the cucumber as I didn't have any on hand and I'm glad I did b/c the lack of excess water meant that this salad could stay refrigerated for quite a few days and still taste great, if not better than the first day!  I also just threw in the peanuts whole to save time.  A keeper and I will make again!  Thank you so much for the great idea!

I have made this recipe twice.  Once exactly as written and once with all sweet potatoes and very little oil.  I loved it both times.  I brought it to a party and people literally raved about it and called it the best potato salad in the world.  I think it is a such a nice alternative to a mayo based salad and it has great flavors.  I serve it with jerk chicken.

This recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS!! Whoever gives this a neg review must have the most boring taste buds.  I made it to compliment my jerk chicken and I loved it and so did my husband. Very easy and tasty.

Whole family loved this.  My daughter hates sweet potatoes but she loved them this way!  Hubby is diabetic and cant have white taters so I sub all sweet taters.  Diabetics can have sweet taters cause they are low on the glycemic index.  FIL loved it too.  He tends to not like new things but he asked for the recipe! Really yummy.  I doubled the sauce too. I liked that it didn't have a creamy mayo based dressing.  I might add some heat next time.  THANK YOU for sharing!

Made the salad for a cookout, using some of the tips from reviewers -- more dressing and added honey & curry -- both good additions.  I didn't really like it and only 1 person at the party did.  I think it just wasn't what I expected.  I would have preferred a sweeter dressing and I found myself wondering if adding pineapple juice to the dressing would  help.  I won't make this again so I'll never know.  Also, the Russets didn't have a good texture.  I'd recommend either using all sweet potatoes or maybe some new red potatoes with less cooking time.

Made this last night and decided to withhold my rating until today to see how it tasted after spending the night in the fridge.  Tasted right after making, uh...no way.  BUT...today is a totally different story!  I think I like it because it is soooo different from your routine summer salad.  The only downside is that it did seem to take a lot of work bringing it all together.  Nonetheless, I'm glad I tried it!

I had high hopes for this salad and while it did not get tossed into the trash, it did not give me that "I want seconds" feeling.  Everyone I served it to at dinner and at a potluck picnic the next day cleaned their plates, but no one went back for more.  I think it needs some "zing" some spice.  I will move on, though, instead of trying to improve upon this recipe.

Seperately I love all the ingredients in the recipe and it sounded like it would be just fabulous all together, I thought it was really just blah...  I read some of the suggestions and did add more salt, added a little extra dressing...all in all, it still ended up just ok.  Perhaps the suggestion of some extra kick might have helped.  Not a keeper for me.

Made this with sweet potatoes only and prepared it a day in advance so my husband could take it to work with him.  I only added the dressing to the cooked potatoes (none of the other vegetable ingredients) and refrigerated them overnight.  My husband forgot to add the cucumber and onion the next day, but remembered the corn and nuts.  Although he does not like sweet potatoes, he said this was very good, especially when eaten with Jay's Jerk Chicken (from this site).  I also thought it was quite tasty (from sampling it) and really loved the smell and taste of the dressing!  Next time I think I'll try both types of potato and make sure all of the ingredients get into it!  Thanks!

Took it to a potluck this weekend.  I left out the peanuts and cucumber... a few folks were scared because it looks different (but the colors are BEAUTIFUL!).  The taste is really good though, very unique!

Loved it!  Didn't have cukes or peanuts on hand. subbed celery for the file, and added a tablespoon of natural, chunky peanut butter to the dressing. Outstanding at room temp immediately after making it

I did add the dressing to the potatoes ahead of time.  (One review mentioned soaking the potatoes in ice water before transferring them to a bowl.  I did this.)  Right before dinner I added the cucumbers and peanuts.  I added a little more mustard and vinegar since the dressing had soaked into the potatoes.  This is the best mix of flavors.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this dish.

The recipe doesn't mention peeling the cucumber, so I did not. Don't like it in this salad at all. Don't see the need to cook the russet potato for 25 minutes either - too mushy!

This was a big hit at all my summer potlucks this year.  My one change (based on other ratings) was to increase the lime juice and reduced the oil to a 1-1 ratio (1 tablespoon lime juice to 1 tablespoon oil).

I made this with freeze-dried cilantro-big mistake.  Would have been pretty good with fresh cilantro.  I also cooked the potatoes too long. Too much oil, not enough flavor.  Mushy. Will not make again

A nice switch up for potato salad.  The dressing is really good and the peanuts a nice crunchy complement.  Maybe a little too much onion and the sweet potato makes more sense than the russet in this salad because it adds flavor obviously.  Pretty solid though and definitely something you can add too as well.

My husband and I both really like this. We rarely eat regular potatoes anymore, so I used 2 sweet potatoes. I had a home made dark mustard dressing on hand so I added lime juice to it. I'm curious what the leftovers will taste like tomorrow. I purposefully added the cucumber to just what was served so we won't have the weeping cucumbers overnight that some people mentioned. Served with Cajun pork loin from this site and sauteed turnip greens. A really nice combination.

Doubled the recipe and made this as a side dish for a cookout. I thought the flavor turned out great--had my doubts when I saw the unique combination of ingredients, but somehow it all worked!  My only problem was that the sweet potatoes turned to mush.  When I mixed the ingredients together, the sweet potatoes didn't retain their shape and just kind of blended into the "sauce." Maybe I cooked them too long?  Never made a potato salad with sweet potatoes before, so I'll have to be more careful next time--and I definitely will make this again! Thanks for sharing!

I love it!  Made it today and used all fresh ingredients...my neighbor's homegrown corn and cucumbers, and cilantro from my garden.  I don't usually follow recipes to the letter and decided not to add mustard or peanuts.  I used olive oil and canola oil and added more lime.  I also used more potatoes and corn.  But the basis of this recipe is divine.  Great alternative to regular potato salad and will withstand the heat for those picnics and BBQs.

We omitted the russet potato and used only sweet potatoes for this recipe. We also used olive oil and slightly increased the cilantro. I didn't have a red onion and substituted green onions for this.  Turned out terrific.

I rate it 4 only because it needed a little more kick in spicing.  Maybe more lime? More caribbean flavoring?  It was an interesting recipe to eat and make and it looked beautiful on the table with our other caribbean dishes.  Will repeat if we go with a repeat caribbean theme!

A new favorite in our house even though I forgot to add the peanuts. I seeded the cucumber. Served this with jerk pork topped with mango salsa and fresh brussel sprouts. Looking forward to making this again...so refreshing!!

This is a very fresh tasting salad - perfect for picnics!  I used fresh corn cut off the cob and increased the lime juice.  I used sunflower oil (since I had it on hand) and a bit more salt.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this for a family picnic a few months ago and it was a hit! The second time I made it, I cut back on the red onion and mixed in a small amount of mashed avocado to the sauce that I had leftover from another recipe I was making and absolutely loved it. Not only does this potato salad have a terrific flavor, it's bright and colorful and I'll be proud to bring it to many more picnics!

I made this for a Jamaican themed wedding shower. It went really well with the jerk chicken and pasta someone else made. I was really skeptical about the overall flavor, but it turned out really good! I got so many compliments on it. I left out the cucumbers because I couldn't find any fresh ones at the grocery store. It still turned out really good. I will definitely make again.

Loved it! I made most of it the day before, and just added the cilantro, cucumber and peanuts at the last minute. Doubled the recipe and took it to a gathering of girlfriends and got a request for the recipe and it was almost gone when I left. I don't really cook, but I can chop and stir. This was perfect for me, and my cooking friends loved it!

I made this for dinner today....my husband and I loved it! Next time will serve slightly chilled. I also used frozen corn and mixed in with water at the last minute, then drained everything together. Did not use peanuts - I don't think I would have liked it. Would have given 5 stars - but I hate chopping & peeling!

My DH hates potato salad but loves sweet potatoes so I thought I'd try this.  It was a hit!  He loved it!  I did make some minor changes; I added a bit of cayenne to the dressing and a little sugar.   I prepared this in the AM so at serving time I squeazed some more lime juice over the salad.  (Note I reserve 5 stars for only to-die-for recipes so for most this would have received a 5)

I wish I'd taken a picture!  I made this with the Alaska Salmon with Pecan Crunch.   It was really good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used two white potatoes and one yam.  And I didn't cook the corn.  I used frozen sweet white corn and just tossed it in with the rinsed potatoes.  I mixed the mustard and honey to taste and others might like it less sweet.  The cucumber and onion should be added last to keep everything fresh and crunchy.  Everyone loved it (four of us destroyed the entire bowl).  I'll be making it again for and upcoming potluck wedding reception/barbeque.  It paired really well with the Pecan Crusted Salmon.  Yum!

I was looking for a salad with no mayo, and this was a good option.  I didn't change anything.  Fairly labour-intensive to prepare the veggies; I cooked both potatoes a day ahead and put in fridge, which helped.  Makes a fairly small salad as recipes states; for a get-together, I'd double it.  Unique combo of flavours and I will make it again.  I served it with chicken tacos.

This was phenomenally good!  I made it with sweet potato as the only vegetable and it was awesome!  My husband usually doesn't care for sweet potato but he gobbled up this and even ate leftovers the next day!  We thought it was best at room temp.

I actually preferred this salad right after I made it compared to after refrigerating overnight.  The lime flavor lessened a bit in the mingling.  Also, the picture of the salad is misleading, since the spectacular color comes from yams, not sweet potatoes (which cook up a pale yellow).  The sweet potatoes were good though, and a nice variation on your average salad.  Thanks for the recipe.

Have to admit, this was not my favorite. I really expected it to be better than it was. I did, however, overcook the potatoes so that had something to do with messingup the texture. Will probably try it again as it sounds really good.

This was a lot of work to prepare, but the results were definitely worth it.    I added a few extra cloves of crushed fresh garlic to this (about 4 total)which gave it a great kick and a wonderful aroma.  I made this for a BBQ with some other side dishes, and this was the one dish that everyone finished.  I got lots of compliments on this one.  It's also really colorful and  looks nice on the table.  The different textures in the ingredients are what made this so unique and delicious. NOTE--I tripled this recipe and it came out fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty different, but in a good way.  I boiled 2 sweet potatoes and about 5 red potatoes.  After they cooled down, I cubed them and added the dressing.  I skipped the cucmber, corn and peanuts because I just felt like it didn't go with the salad.  It still came out pretty good.
The dressing was light and refreshing.
Thanks!
