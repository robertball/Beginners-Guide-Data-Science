This is a new St. Patty's day favorite for us.  I used ground lamb instead of beef, and substituted celery for parsnip.   I also added fresh chopped parsley and fresh chopped rosemary.   It was still a bit bland, but that can be fixed with a few extra spices, and my kids actually prefer it more on the bland side.  I will be making this again! :-)  I might try adding garlic next time.

This was a nice simple meal to make. However my husband didn't like it and he's mostly Irish. The consistency was off for him. I enjoyed it more, but will not be making it again. I had listened to others about the blandness of this dish and spiced it with thyme, peper and garlic salt. We both enjoyed the flavor. I toppped mine with shredded white sharp chedder too which helped.

I was disappointed.  I made this for St. Patty's day. Bland and watery.

So nice to see this! Just like my Granny's white stew we have had for over 40 years. I do the same but without the parsnips and add a tsp of worcestershire. But that sounds yummy too.

To keep this from being runny, make sure the water just covers the potatoes. 

 All my kids devour this with Irish soda bread (NOT the kind with raisins in it). Thanks for putting this recipe up!
