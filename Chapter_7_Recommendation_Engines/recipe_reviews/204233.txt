Great for lunch and being that BLT's are great sandwiches it would make sense that with the proper variation they'd make a great salad.  Well, logic did prove correct and this was very good, quick, and easy - even if you don't use Wonder bread you can use whatever bread you have in your kitchen.

I cheated and use pre-made texas toast garlic and cheese croutons. Other than that, I followed the recipe exact. Next time, I'll increase the tomatoes. We really enjoyed this salad. All the ingredients went together well and it was a snap to assemble.

A nice idea for getting the same taste as a classic BLT.  The way I made the bread croutons was that I toasted the bread cubes in the skillet after I cooked and drained the bacon.  Also added some milk to the dressing to make a better (I thought) salad dressing consistency.

I used some store bought croutons I had on hand and put a couple teaspoons of sugar and a little mustard in the dressing.  As is, the dressing was too tart for my taste.
