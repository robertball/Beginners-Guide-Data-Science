This recipe had a nice flavor. It was different than I expected but still good. I also wrapped the ground beef in the crepes then topped with sauce and cheese. They looked a lot like enchiladas but the cornmeal crepes were a nice variation. I will definitely make this again but maybe next time I will try adding Ranch Style Beans to the meat. I think they would go nice with the flavor of the sauce.

I changed this a bit just to suit our tastes. Didn't use celery, added corn kernals instead of creamed corn and didn't layer the crepes. I just put some meat and sauce mixture in each crepe, rolled each one up then layed them in a dish, sprinkled with cheese and cooked until bubbling. Served with a dollop of sour cream on top. Very yummy.

I wouldn't make these again.  I found them to be bland and dry.  They need a whole lot more sauce and a lot more kick as well.  The cormeal crepes weren't worth the effort.  They tasted barely any different than regular.  I would have preferred tortillas.
