I baked these in small individual casserole dishes which worked great.  Packed in the potatoes, used a custard cup to make the “well,” pressed in the ham, added the egg, and that was it.  I served with  Quick and Easy Hollandaise Sauce in the Microwave on this site.  Just really tasty, really easy, and a fun new way to serve potatoes-ham-eggs.  Excellent brunch item, too!

With lots of shredded cheddar and chives, gave a nice flavor combination.  Easy to make, looked good on the table.

I didn't have ham slices, so I cooked bacon and crumbled it.  My husband raved about this casserole and wants it again and again.  Thanks.

Fantastic!  Made it just like the recipe using leftovers from Thanksgiving and my wife said it was the best breakfast she has ever had.  Very tasty!

Made these in an oversized muffin tin (6 muffins) with leftover mashed potatoes and diced ham. No parsley, just salt and pepper. Used Trader Joe's prepared hollandaise - couldn't have been easier. Overcooked the eggs with a 30 minute bake time, but the little cups were tasty and cute as a button!

This recipe is about as simple as it gets and it is delicious.. As suggested I used up all the left overs in the fridge except for the smoked salmon. I even put some crumbled blue cheese in the potatoes and it was very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good!  I think the individual cups is a great idea, as mine was pretty goopy, but SO loved them!  I used the Blender Hollandaise Sauce recipe from this site, and that was surprisingly good.

Loved these! I had some leftover tarragon mashed potatoes that I needed to put to use, and some deli ham as well. Did an ingredients search and this recipe popped up (love that feature). We love eggs benedict, so I knew we would like this. Thanks Chef Ernie!
