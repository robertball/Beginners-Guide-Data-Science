Well, no fault of the recipe - more like my nonexistent "butterflying" skills - but while my stuffed turkey rolls were pretty ugly, they tasted good!  I did make a couple changes - made my own stuffing and added some sauteed onions,  celery and herbs; poured a little turkey stock in the bottom of the baking dish to help keep moist (ended up making nice drippings for a gravy base) and I put a couple little pats of butter on top of each turkey roll for flavor, color and additional moisture, and sprinkled with some thyme.  Not so sure I liked the pecans in this, but it was overall a pretty tasty meal!

These were great!  My entire family loved them and it made a ton.  It actually ended up making 4 rolls and five of us only ate one.  We froze the others and are excited about getting to eat them again.  Definitely a great alternative to boring turkey for the holidays.

This recipe is good because it's adaptable.  I think it would also be good with the cranberries and pecans, but I have fussy eaters in my house.  I instead mixed a little honey and garlic in with the stuffing.  It tasted great.  It's easy to customize for your family's taste, but makes a beautiful presentation for dinner parties an other occasions too!  Very tasty and nice appearance.

I made this recipe for Christmas Dinner and it came out great.  I had a lot of stuffing left over, and just baked it off in a casserole dish to serve along side.   The recipe says to remove the skin, but I left it on in an effort to keep the meat as moist as possible.  Also, I poured about a half a cup of chicken stock in the pan prior to roasting.  This allowed me to make a nice gravy to go along with it.  The gravy definitely helped with the moisture level.  All in all, I'll definitely make again!

So Good!  This was very tasty, and the leftovers are great sliced up for sandwiches.  I was worried I wouldn't have enough so I made some extra with large chicken breasts as well and they were good too.  The hardest part is stuffing and tying - but then I'm a bit of a klutz :)

I changed the recipe to use apples in the stuffing instead of cranberries.  They turned out okay.  Good recipe but not a wow recipe.  I would make it again though.

I found it prety easy to make with easy ingredients and a relatively short cook time (considering it's turkey). BUt I do not see my extended family being happy with this as the main entree on Thanksgiving day...I will have to make a whole turkey but I think I will also serve this on the side. I did not sear it before hand, just put in a pyrex dish and rubbed some sage, poultry seasoning and pepper on it and poured some chicken broth in the bottom of the pan.  Cooked for 1 hour but I could have taken it out earlier. One thing that got on my nerves is that the cranberries and nuts fell out once I started cutting and serving. Seems like something sticky should be added to sort-of glue the nuts and berries together.

This was very good and pretty! A little difficult to make but well worth it. I used walnuts instead of pecans.

Making a stuffed turkey would have been much easier!  It was impossible to "roll" up the turkey without it falling apart.  Didn't cook evenly (dry edges).  Very cumbersome and difficult recipe.

I loved the recipe and thought the flavors went very well together.  Unfortunately my husband doesn't like cranberries in anything other than trail mix and picked them all out.

A hit!  We served this for Christmas dinner 2012.  It made for a beautiful presentation on our family china and was yummy!  The leftovers were just as yummy the next day.
