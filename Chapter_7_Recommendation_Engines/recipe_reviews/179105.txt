I was very disappointed with this recipe. The cooking time is way off. Had to move it to a pot on the stove to finish cooking it to have it for a supper that was later than I planned. I will not make it again.

I found this recipe very basic but with a little creativity it was very good. I added some of my own spices and the cook time is also off I ended up cooking on high for 6 hours. But in the end it was pretty good.

This was a good base to jump from.  Instead of water and powdered beef, I added a can of condensed beef boullion (soup) and a can of condensed consumé soup.   And then I went crazy because I had some things to get rid of, so I added about 2 oz of saké and half a can of poutine sauce (similar to chicken gravy) that were taking up space on my counter.  Usually when I start throwing things in like that, it ends up tasting like a mistake -- but not this time.  It's absolutely delicious.  So I gave myself 5 stars.

Thank you Kel67.  Great recipe.  Tried it, and just keep on making it.  Would not change a thing.  Your Gram's cooking is what keeps the memories alive.  Keep up the good work.

Cook time was way off and needed to add more cornstarch that it called for.

I haven't even finished cooking it yet, but it smells wonderful.  I tasted it and it was absolutely delightful.  The sage reminds me of Thanksgiving Day when I was a child.

This was pretty good but I think the addition of an Irish stout would have put this over the top!
The husband said it could have been thicker but that was my fault for not adding more cornstarch.
