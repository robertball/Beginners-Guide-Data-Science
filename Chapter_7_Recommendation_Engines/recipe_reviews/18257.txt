My husband gave me the ultimate compliment saying, "You can make this again!"

Here is what I did - steam the cabbage (healthier and tastier than boiling). Make a bechamel sauce with butter, flour (I used Wondra) and 1 cup of milk. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Layer the tender cabbage, bechamel and grated Swiss cheese. Bake until golden on top and bubbly around the sides.

Next time we're going to add a little mustard to the bechamel for extra tang. But it's delicious as is.

I would have rated this higher, but I did make some changes.

this was really good. after reading all the reviews i didnt precook the cabbage and i used much less than called for. i sauteed some onion and garlic w/ the margarine before making the bechamel sauce. then i added some shredded carrots to my finely sliced cabbage. salt and pepper made this wonderful. it really reminded me of mac and cheese. i melted some margarine w/ the bread crumbs and added those 10 mins before the end of baking time.i will make this again.next time i will melt the cheese into the bechamel sauce so i dont have to cut it. served this w/ tuna coney dogs from this site.

Not bitter at all -- sweet and cheesy.  Make sure to let the white sauce thicken before spreading it.   We liked it a lot.

I liked it, but mainly because I used some delicious cabbage.  The cheese was kinda runny and the overall appearance and texture was not appealing.  It did not keep well in the fridge.

good but instead of layering the cabbage & bechamel and american cheese slices I added shredded sharp cheddar to the bechamel and then added the steamed cabbage (don't boil the cabbage - it is easily overcooked and too limp) then into casserole and topped with bread crumbs - add breadcrumbs about half hour into the baking for toasted but not burnt crumbs or cover for the first half hour and then remove.

This is a delicious dish.  I scaled it down for two, but didn't use nearly as much cabbage as specified in the recipe. As listed that's a lot of cabbage. I also didn't pre-cook the cabbage. And I added a teaspoon or so of parmesan to the roux - otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the dish was cooked perfectly.  Will be using this recipe again soon.

This was O.K. My husband who generally likes cabbages didn't care for it at all. I proably won't make it again. I did cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot!!

What a change from just steamed or boiled cabbage! A great substitute for potatoes or rice.

We love cabbage and have had cabbage cooked in similar recipes but this one is just too too rich for a side dish.   It is fine for people who like heavy rich side dishes but not to our taste.    Sorry for this review but this is how we feel about it.    Glad that some people did like it.

Surprisingly good!  This makes much more than 6 servings though, so cut it in half.  I did not put the bread crumbs on.
