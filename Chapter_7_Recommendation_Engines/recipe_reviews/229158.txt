Very tasty - sweet shot.  Everyone liked the taste.  Our Irish cream didn't curdle as much as we would've liked (maybe we poured too much or didn't wait long enough), but it still looked cool and was a big hit at the party!  The more grenedine, the more bloody and sweeter the shot.

I'm sure this would have tasted better if the liquor was chilled before we made them....
