This is a recipe with potential. For my batch I used chunks of beef rather than ground beef; I added a celery stalk cut in small pieces; some rosemary, marjoram and thyme; about 1/4 cup of cooking wine and a bay leave. It turned out to be a very fragrant dish and quite tasty!

Love this recipe with a few modifications.  I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of chopped fresh garlic and some chopped mushrooms.

Tried this recipe this evening, was good.  One other poster mentioned it was a bit bland and I have to agree.  Going to try it again tho, and add some tomato chunks, turnip, and bump up the amount of soy sauce and molasses.

Good basic recipe. Definitely one you want to change up! I used 1 full cup of barley, 1 (14 oz) can of chicken stock, and seasoned my meat while cooking it. I also added some chopped cherry tomatoes. Next time I will add a lot more veggies! Chard or kale would be great and I would definitely up the carrots to at least 2 c. (maybe even a full pound) to make it a more complete one pot meal. Serves more than just 4. I also suggest cooking everything in a dutch oven on the stove top so you can just slide it into the oven without dirtying another dish.

Really, really good! I added 3 stalks of celery, sliced, some garlic salt and upped the Soy Sauce and Molasses to 3 TBSP each. Very easy and very good.

I made several changes to this recipe after reading through previous reviews. First, I used 1 cup of barley. I used one very large clove of garlic (the equivalent of 1 or 2 smaller cloves) and sautéed it with the onions for a couple minutes in about 1 Tbsp butter before browning the ground beef. I used 2 cups of sliced carrots and chopped up 2 stalks of celery as well. I used pure maple syrup in place of the molasses (because it's what I had on hand) and then used Campbell's beef consommé in place of the water. It was absolutely delicious and I have already added it to my recipe binder!!

Based on other users suggestions, I added 1 cup more of carrots, upped the soy sauce and molasses to 3 T each, and used beef broth instead of water. At first I thought it was too sweet, but then it grew on me. This recipe has great potential, it just needs a little tweaking. Upping the carrots was a good call. Next time I'd go back to 2 T molasses and maybe use worcestire instead of soy sauce

I too added garlic, thyme, mustard powder, red pepper and changed water to beef broth. I like this better than soup and my picky eater says he like it!

I thought it was too dry and way too sweet. If I do try again, I will cut the molasses in half and use beef stock instead.

We added most of the things that different cooks suggested i.e. mushrooms, garlic, celery, bay leaf, rosemary and thyme, and substituted chicken stock for the water. We left out the molasses as we didn't have any and we don't like sweet tastes combined with meat very much!
Absolutely delicious

Well we liked it. I season ALL my meat while I am cooking it. So I had added salt and pepper to the beef while I browned it. WE love garlic so I added minced garlic to it as well. BUT I added two strips of crisp bacon that we broke up into small pieces. (left overs in fridge we didn't want to go to waste or have kids fight over. Left a small batch plain for youngest and both tasted pretty good.
