This recipe was great! As another Texan reviewer mentioned, it is almost identical to King Ranch casserole, if you make it with plain corn tortilla chips, which is what I had on hand. I also made a few other modifications; Added about 1.5 cups of coursely chopped white onion (wish I hadnt, red or green would have been better). I poached the chicken in a T of olive oil, 4 small cloves of garlic, salt, pepper and mesquite seasoning, adding about half a can of tomatoes with green chile and juice. The flavor from that was good. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of slicing the processed cheese and I think I won't do that again - shredding would have gotten a more even consistency. I added a layer of finely crushed ships over that and topped it with shredded mixed cheese (monterrey jack and colby) - this made a great topping. Topped it with black pepper and parsley.  My boyfriend had 3 servings - he loved it!

I used salsa instead of the can of tomatoes and chili's, I also substituted lime tortilla chips.  It tasted exactially like "Applebee's" tequilla lime chicken.

This was okay. I didn't care for all the soup.  Maybe a big jar of salsa instead for a change of pace.

Instead of shredding the cheese food, you should slice it

Made this for dinner tonight.  Perfect for the crumbs at the bottom of our chip bags.  Use blue and white corn tortilla chips.  Drained the can of rotel so it wasn't as runny as others said.  Great quick meal, just wish I hadn't eaten so much of it.

I did not like it as much as my family did, I prefer my chips crunchy. Could use the topping as a dip.

I made this for my husband and son.  They loved it.  I make a mexican chicken that is very similar to this which they love as well.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again and again.

my boyfriend really liked the flavor of this dish.  I used tomatoes with jalepenos in this version of the recipe and I flavored the chicken with chicken spices and parmesean cheese.

Pretty good stuff. Instead of the dice tomatoes i used green salsa. Also added some colby cheese and chopped green onions. I used some alredy cooked chicken i had and threw it in with its seasons. It came out pretty good. Perfect use  for leftover chips and chicken.

Delicious!  This dish doesn't look that appealing but it is really tasty.  It was a big hit with my kids and my husband when I first made it.  I ended up making it again about a week later for company and it got rave reviews again.

Very much like King Ranch Chicken (Biggest ranch in Texas). King Ranch is better, but this is so much easier to make.  I just threw the chips in the bottom, layered leftover chopped turkey that I had browned a little in garlic, olive oil, chili powder.  I then added a thin layer of shredded casserole cheese (sharp cheddar will also work) Spread the soup mixture ( I also used salsa instead of the tomatoes and chile peppers). Cooked all for 30 min. then topped with cheese.

We liked this recipe for the most part.  It was kind of bland. I did change a few things.  I added a can of black beans, cut the chicken up and put the chips on top, under the cheese instead of at the bottom.  It gave it a nice crispy topping.  We also topped ours with sour cream and salsa.  Next time I make it I will season the chicken before adding the soup mixture.  I will also cut the milk down to 1/2 a cup, it was far too runny.

I used habinaro with tomatoes, and it was really spicy. Surprisingly, it was like a casserole, the chips sofetened and provided a nice layer under the chicken. I would make it again.

Excellent and very easy casserole!  I browned some lean beef with an onion and spread that over the chips instead of the chicken and it was great.  I'll be making this again for future potlucks.

I love how quick and easy this dish is. My husband and son love it as well. I use blue corn chips on the bottom and dice up some red onion as well. I also serve it with salsa on top to add some more flavor.

This had a great flavor but was way too runny for my taste. I think next time I will cube the chicken add about a pound of egg noodles to sop up all that milk. Otherwise, excellent!

easy to do but pretty bland even though I added black beans, garlic and onion powder and chili pepper flakes. I swapped the milk for sour cream because I didn't want this to be soupy and it was still a soupy, sloppy mess that didn't look good at all.  2 cans chicken soup instead of one of them being mushroom. probably better with nacho chips but all I had was regular. Not sure what processed shredded cheese is even supposed to be, so I went with layering in about 3 cups of Mexican blend between the layers I created. 350- 30 minutes. 375 seemed to hot

the only thing i did that wasnt stated here was drain the rotel, and boild the chicken breasts and shred them up a bit before layering it all. i also used colby jack shredded cheese, this made it not soggy and more evenly flavored bites
