Light Tasty Easy vinaigrette dressing! I added a half cup of lemon juice the same as the balsamic and rice vinegar. Very Happy! Thank you for sharing

I made this dressing to put over some broccoli slaw. I threw them together and let it soak overnight. I found the balsamic vinegar in this recipe to be overpowering so I tried adding garlic. This didn't help; the only thing that did was adding more oil/rice vinegar. I would not make this recipe again.

Easy and tasty this salad dressing complements the veggies without overpowering them. I followed the recipe exactly cutting everything in half for fewer servings. Thanks for the recipe!

Ran out of dressing with guests on the way:eek: and threw this together worked great! Used a bit of Stevia instead of sugar. Put it in a store bought almost empty bottle and everyone thought it was store bought!!!! Yikes:)

Try making this with WHITE balsamic vinegar! Adds a lighter taste.
