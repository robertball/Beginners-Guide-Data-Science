There are a couple of "secrets" to making the perfect gooey Rice Krispie Treats:  (1) the stovetop is THE way to go (2) you HAVE to melt the butter sloooowly and make sure it doesn't turn brown at all.  (3) mix in the marshmallows and melt them just as slowly. If the butter gets brown, the treats will be dry.  We double our recipe and it still fits fine into a 13x9 pan (grease the pan w/butter).  To make them truly gooey use the following measurements: 11.5 cups Rice Krispies, 1 whole stick of butter, (1) 16oz bag of mini marshmallows. (I always use Jet Puff brand).  I've become the neighborhood "treat" maker because the neighbors say theirs never turn out like mine.

I only make rice krispies for Valentines day.  I add red (or pink) Wilton's concentrated paste icing colour to the melted marshmallows, about 1/4 TSP.  Incorporate the red tinted marshmallows to the cereal by stiring in very well, Making sure it's all covered. I cut them out with heart shaped cutters and melt down pink (or red) candy melts and then spread it around the edges of the krispy hearts to adhere the pink sugar on half of the batch and the other half I use heart shaped sprinkles!.  It's very cute.

Pressing the squares into the dish with waxed paper is an ingenious idea.  I took a hint from the recipe on the marshmallow bag and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the melted marshmallows.  This takes me back to middle school...

Can't go wrong with a good rice Krispie treat, I say!! My version gets a five star, though. I add about 1/3 cup of mini M&M's sprinkled in while spreading so they don't melt. Delicious and colorful!

Very good with 1/2 tsp. vanilla stirred into the melted marshmallow. Also spray one hand with cooking spray to press down in the pan with no mess & no stickiness. This is the best if eaten all in the same day!!

I kept looking at the cute photo of the hearts and had to try making these. I made it in the microwave and after the 2 minutes the marshmallows blew up! Ugh, what a mess that was! I should've taken a picture of that! Instead of using a spatula or wax paper to press shape them, I just sprayed my hands with nonstick spray. These are a classic and loved by all, so I'll make again, but next time on the stove!!

You almost can't get any better than this!  For an extra something special I like to frost them with 3/4 C butterscotch chips and 1 1/2 C semi-sweet chips, melted.

I've never used exact measurements for rice krispies treats, but this one is a winner.  I did however use about a cup less of cereal, because we like our treats extra gooey!!!

Hands down the easiest, quickest, and most delicious rice krispies ever!  I made these for the first time ever following this recipe exactly, and everyone raved!  Don't change a thing, this recipe is perfect as is!  A word of advice...patience is key in this recipe.  I had my burner set to low heat the entire time I was melting the butter and the marshmallows.  It does take a little while, but your patience will be rewarded!  I also sprayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray to aid in removing the treats from the pan when they were ready to eat, as well as a spray for my hands to help me press the treats down into the pan.  Thanks for a perfect recipe!

Yum! The original is always the best. I use parchment paper to line my baking sheet since it doesn't need any preparation, nothing ever sticks to it, and makes for easy clean up too.

I love rice crispie treats because I remember them from my childhood. Since I know live in chile i love baking "american" things to give to my family.. and these were great!  I replaced the rice krispies for choco krispies because they dont sell the regular cereal here.. they are just as good, i recommend trying them. this was perfect, DONT CHANGE A THING. the amounts of ingredients are just right..

Everybody loves this recipe!  It's also kind of fun to mix the cereal.  I've used Frosted Flakes (interesting)and Cheerio's.  I also like to put sprinkles in around different holidays and occasions.

This recipe is the BEST.  Too many people twist this recipe and ruin it completely.  There is absolutely no need to change a thing.  Use real butter and the real Rice Krispies not generic.  If you are going to make them, then make them right.

When I was a kid, my Great Grandmother added 1/4 to 1/2 cup peanut butter to her Rice Crispy bars and they were AWESOME! I still do that today and they are the hit of the neighborhood! Add it to while melting the marshmallows!

I think it is a good idea to melt the butter and marshmallows slowly because high temperatures turn them brown. So, I'd like to recommend that you use the microwave instead of the stove. It's faster and it doesn't turn the marshmallows brown. Why don’t you drink some milk with it? Add some almonds or peanuts, etc. If you want more colorful Rice Krispy Treats , try to add ½ teaspoon of green tea powder or strawberry powder. It makes them look more exciting.Thanks!

very good. i made some variations based on other recipes, so here's what i did: i used roughly 3 tablespoons of light butter, 1 package of mini marshmallows, 5 ish cups of rice crispies, and a couple dashes of vanilla extract.  after everything was combined, i formed it into the pan and put mini chocolate chips and drizzled peanut butter on them. SO good!

If you want Rice Krispies Treat then this is, in my opinion, the only recipe you should use. It may not be complex, but it's always yummy! Personally, I like my bars a little thicker, so I fill a 9x9x2in. pan to the brim. Yum!

Mine were quite hard to bite in... I had to warm it a little bit before eating it all, but over-all, it was really yummy! I think I'll add some vanilla or a tablespoon or so of milk next time, Great recipe!

We love this recipe as well BUT you MUST try them at least once using the cocoa krispies!!! They are just as good plus you get a little bit of chocolate fix at the same time! So good & yummy. Hope y'all like them.

Such a classic, and you can use so many different types of cereals! A friend of mine used the fruity krispies (Sorry I don't remember the name) and they were so good, although a tad sweet. Experiment!

Perfect treat! I can spend hours making elaborate desserts but nothing makes everyone dance and sing the way this does. I like to add a little extra marshmallow which will keep it softer for longer as well as occasionally add some peanut butter or regular M&M's for a special treat. Be careful to only lightly press into the dish otherwise you'll end up with an inedible brick 2 days later.

These are great simple treats, you can make in minutes!!! Cheaper and much better than buying store-made. I used equal parts ceral and marshmellows, I like a chewier bar, more marshmellows do it for me!

This is probably the first thing I ever made by myself. I even did a presentation on how to make them for a school project as a kid. I made them in the microwave of course, which I don't think alters them at all.

My kids love eating this as well as helping me make it!  My step-son is a chocoholic like me, so we use Chocolate Rice Crispies instead although we have used this with different cereals as well.  This is an easy recipe to make that takes no time and the kids can get involved with.
