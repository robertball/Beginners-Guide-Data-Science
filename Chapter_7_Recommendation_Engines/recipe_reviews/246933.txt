First time,  followed recipe.  Love it.  Second time,  substituted ground turkey and added a little poultry spice.  Third time, substituted diced chicken and added thawed mixed vegetables.     All delicious and easy.

Family loved it, even my picky kid.  I used a full box of stove top and increased the milk to 1.5 cups.  Also used tasteful simple dried onions & garlic instead of fresh.  Turned out great

Made as written and this turned out good for me. The stuffing mix gave it a uniqueness from others I have tried. I do think it needed more milk but that is the only change I would make. Thanks for sharing!

I put the tater tots on top instead of bottom. It was a huge hit with my family. Crunchy top.
