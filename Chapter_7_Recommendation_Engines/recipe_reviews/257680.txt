Absolutely delish! I didn't have any fresh basil on hand, but with all the other flavors, I didn't miss it. My artichokes were the marinated variety, so that probably helped. It came together easily, but felt fancy. I would definitely serve this to guests.

This was excellent! I loved all of the extras that went into this. The one flavor I didn't think went together was the green olive and basil. To me they clashed but my husband liked them together so there you have it. I love green olives but for me, black would have worked better in this. You be the judge...
