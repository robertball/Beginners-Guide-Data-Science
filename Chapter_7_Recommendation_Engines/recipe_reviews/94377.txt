This is like a cross between a calzone and a Philly cheese steak sandwich. As far as my family is concerned, it's the best of both worlds. I used steak-ums with this, added more seasonings and used provolone cheese. You Eagles fans are the most loyal I've ever seen in the country and I'm loyal in that I'll certainly be doing this recipe again. Thanks Airborne!

Oh, yum.  This recipe took 2 of my favorite foods (calzones and cheesesteaks) and combined them into a practically sinful meal.  What a great idea.  Now, I typically like my cheesesteaks "Whiz Wit", so that's how I made this sandwich.  I used a whole onion and good ol' Cheez Whiz.  I probably could have went a little heavier on the Whiz, but it was fine.  I also used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh.  25 mins cooking time would have burnt my tasty sammy, because when I checked in at 21 mins it was just at the point of dark where if I would have let it go a bit more it wouldn't have been a good thing.  Next time I think I'll take it out around 19 or 20 mins, but that may just depend on the brand/type of dough - this time I used store brand.  Either way, keep an eye on that.  I will most definitely make this again.  Everyone in this house dove into it.  I should have made 2!

My variation:  I brushed homemade pizza dough with a little bbq sauce before adding the toppings. and used fresh grated cheddar and mozzarella cheeses; added chopped green peppers too.  This is definitely one for the recipe box!

This is pretty good.  I added some horse radish to give it more flavor.Makes a good size sandwich and it's also a kid pleaser.

I thought this was great..first time I followed recipe exactly and I loved it. Second time, I decided to put an italian spin on it, I used ham, pepperoni, mozz cheese, bell pepper and a little pizza sauce. It was delicious and so good left over for lunches...we'll be doing a lot more experimenting with this recipe..thanks!

This was not good. It had no flavor and needed some kind of sauce or dressing inside. Will not be making it again.

Phooey.  Couldn't get the bottom to crisp up, even upping the temp and time.  I put in extra spices, onions and green pepper.  Perhaps saute the veggies first next time.  I think they pretty much steamed in the dough and kept it from browning.

This was a nice treat.  It really is not like a sandwich, but more like a calzone.  I had to cook mine about ten minutes longer as it was not done in 25 mins.  Other than that, it is a quick, easy dish.

Awesome! I made two of them for my honey and I, and we ate one and a half! Instead of American cheese, I used shredded cheddar. I also added extra onions and mushrooms. I was going to dip it in pizza sauce, but it was too amazing alone. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy!  My husband and son gobbled it up.  I did add some more seasonings to the onions and mushrooms.  A pepper of some kind would add flavor.  All in all, a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Left out the garlic and made more of the onion and mushroom mix than it called for because my pizza crust came in a 13 oz size, and I wanted plenty of veggies.  It was awesome and my Eagles fan hubby loved it too.  Even my 5 year old liked it and he hates anything with meat in it.

I didn't have any refrigerated pizza crust roll, so I used my own pizza crust recipe.  The dough was not cooked thoroughly on the inside, so I would suggest cooking at 425F for 20 min next time (or whatever your pizza crust recipe suggested cooking time requires).  My husband love this dish regardless of the somewhat uncooked center.

This was a very quick and easy supper. Nice blend of flavors, probably could have added some chopped green peppers in this.  It even warmed up nice.

The sauteed vegetables were delicious in this sandwich. I substituted the American cheese (I don't believe in it) with Havarti that I had left over.  MUCH better than that fake stuff.  The crust got a bit soggy at the thinner parts from all of the grease.  The flavor was great.

I enjoyed this more than hubby did, but he still liked it. He's not fond of "vegetation" LOL. I used provolone cheese and some monterey jack that needed used up. This was quick and simple, and we'll be having this again.

Excellent recipe and very versatile!!  We made these like a Philly cheese steak sandwich and used cheese whiz rather than sliced cheese.  Served with pizza sauce on the side.  Also made with sliced ham (left over from a Honey Glazed Ham - recipe from this site), swiss cheese and honey mustard.  Yummy!!

This was very tasty as is, and has lots of potential!  I made it according to the directions posted, but can definitely see myself adding pepperoni, salami, ham, and other ingrediants as well.  Thanks for posting!
