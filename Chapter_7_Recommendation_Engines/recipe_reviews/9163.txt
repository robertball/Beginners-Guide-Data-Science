Before I even know what this recipe taste like, I am in a dilemma. I followed the recipe exactly to the dot, but not knowingly, used fresh pineapple juice I have on hand.  Then I discover that the jello won't set.  I think if the recipe had warned that only canned pineapple to be used, I would be in a better spot right now.  So warning to all newbies like me.

This cranberry salad was wonderful!  So much so that my guests on Christmas found themselves filling up on this rather than meat and potatos.  Full of texture and flavor much like that of my grandmothers.  Loved it.  Thanks Mary.

This recipe will become our new family tradition.  It is delicious.  We like the fruit-a-plenty texture and flavor.  I followed it exactly except did not find raspberry flavored gelatin in the store so used mixed fruit flavored.  Overly particular mother-in-law said she could make a meal of it.  I made it for T'giving and think I will make it for Christmas again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, MTM.

This was so good! Everyone loved it. I used pineapple juice for the water, sugar free jello, splenda, and I also added celery, walnuts, and pomegrante. I will have to make this every year at Thanksgiving.

This turned out to be awesome! I would give it 5 stars but I had to change some things according to what ingerdients I had. I used cranberry jello, can pineapple chunks, sweetened cranberries, and cherries. I didn't have an orange so I used a can of mandarin oranges. I also used only 1/2 cup sugarand a little less water------it was soooo good!!!

Served this at Christmas and it received rave reviews; tool a while to set, so would recommend making the day before.  Used fresh cranberries and ran through a food processor.  Great with both turkey and ham.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it, even those that don't usually like cranberry salad.  They requested it again for Christmas, and it was a big hit again.  This is a keeper.

I have made this salad twice and everyone loved it both times.  The first time, I forgot to get rasberry jello and used cherry instead.  It was still great.  I also added crushed walnuts to the recipe.  I was asked for the recipe both times.  Highly recommend!

Absolutely loved this recipe!!  It will from now on be a Thanksgiving staple at my home.  Followed the recipe w/ few exceptions.  Used one cranberry flavored gelatin and one raspberry.  Also left out the grapes. The flavor is amazing.  All of them blend together beautifully.  My favorite is the orange smell and flavor.   Thank you for sharing your recipe :)

I don't know what I was thinking, I agreed to make a jello dish for an anniversary luncheon.  Nobody eats jello, and I knew I would be stuck with lots of left overs.  

When I saw the reviews for this dish, I was willing to take a chance.

I did use dried cranberries, that I chopped up.  I also chopped up pecans and threw those in.  I also cut the grapes smaller, since I knew there would be babies eating it.

I think the real key is, it needs to be in the fridge 24 hours.  
when I blended the ingredients, it didn't look good at all.  I tasted it, and was not pleased.
Then after sitting 24 hours in the fridge, it was totally different in appearance & flavor.

Out of the hundreds of events I have been too, there is always left over jello.  Until now, not only did I come home with a clean bowl, I had many people asking for the recipe.

Thanks for all the reviews for their helpful suggestions!

I was trying to figure out a way to get the kids to eat their cranberries at Thanksgiving and figured there was no better way than in a jello! For the most part it worked! The adults liked it too, and I actually preferred it over the actual cranberry sauce. I will make this again, and not just during the holidays.

So tasty, I could and have eaten this for dessert!  I use my little chopper from Tupperware to chop the cranberries.  Also I use canned mandarin oranges in place of the orange it calls for.  I add chopped pecans too.  Very good!

A similar recipe had been a traditional holiday side dish that my Dad made for many years. He asked me to take over a couple of years ago. Last year, I couldn't find the recipe so I made this one instead. He loved it more than his original recipe. The only thing I do different is add about 1/2 cup (heaping) toasted chopped pecans. Delicious!

This is very similar to the cranberry salad my mother made in the 40s, just leave out grapes and orange. I made it for years in a meat (food) grinder. My family makes it in food processor, but results are always 5 stars.

My jello did not set. Only after this blunder did I notice that it says on the jello box NOT to use fresh pineapple. It would have been helpful to say 'use only canned pineapple' in the ingredients list.

This is almost like the one my mother made (from back in the 50's) -she never gave me the recipe, but she used black cherry jello and added Coke to the jello (in place of or partially for the cold water). She also cooked the cranberries til popped and cut up a peeled orange and chopped celery and walnuts. If anyone has this recipe -please let me know! This one comes really close.

I was sooooo upset to learn after putting lots of hard work into this recipe, that not only was I not crazy about the taste, but my family did not like it either.  Two whole pans was wasted this Thanksgiving.  :(  What can I say...us, Southerners are used to our salty, homemade cornbread dressing.
