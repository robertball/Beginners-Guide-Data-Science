I wonder if the person that gave this a poor rating because it took so long to cook neglected to notice that the chicken in the recipe is to already be cooked? I used my own biscuit recipe and this turned out fabulous!

takes MUCH longer than 20 minutes to cook. After 35 minutes I had to take it out because the biscuits were burning and it was very runny. Didn't like the cream of chicken flavor and couldn't taste the dill at all. Will not be making this again.

I adore this recipe but i find it much better with just a few very simple changes. First of all i cook it in the oven without the biscuits for 10 minutes then add them on top and put it back in for 15. I also add a brick of cream cheese to the soup mixture for some extra taste. and if i really want to be adventureous i mix in corn and i top with grated cheese cheese goes on before the biscuits. these are just a few fast easy things that i find improve this meal. thanks for it i love it

This recipe was great! Instead of using refrigerated Ready-made biscuits we used the Bisquick Drop Biscuits recipe off the Bisquick box. It was so fantastic. Next time we also might try the recipe with Rosemary and Thyme instead of Dill. I am sure that would be fantastic as well.

This is wonderful comfort food. Usually recipes with dill don't contain enough for my taste but this was right on the money. I omitted the olives and used a cream of chicken and herb soup for a little extra flavor. I served it up with baked potatos and it was so filling that no one even thought about seconds. It also reheats wonderfully.

The dill flavoring was great (but very rich). I think you really have to be an olive lover to enjoy this one (which I am not). Also this biscuits were burnt on top and completely raw on the bottom. I had to flip the biscuits to get the tops done...kind of messy.

I used this as a base to make a chicken pot pie type dish. I used 3 chicken breasts cut up into small peices and mixed that with the soup and milk. I also put in carrots peas and celery and a big spoon full of lite sour cream to give it a bit of extra creaminess. I also put in some garlic salt and some salt and pepper to taste. NO green olives though-YUCK! Then I put it in a large cake sized pan and put 2 containers of biscuits over the entire thing. It turned out amazing!! Everyone who had it raved about how good it was!

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe to the letter and will be making it again! I had some leftovers and they kept very well over the next couple of days.

I really liked this recipe. We accidentally put in way too much dill and it ended up tasting really good. However 20 minutes wasn't enough to cook the biscuits. They were still really doughy on the bottom. I like it though because I love dough haha.

Sorry although it was easy to make and smelled very good it didn't turn out too good. I had to cook longer then directed and the rolls were half cooked half mush and the chicken was a little dry. The sauce was great though I will give you that.

Very quick easy dish! I added a little broccoli to it cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and mixed everything together. Yum! The only issue I had was with getting the biscuits to cook on the bottom; I wound up covering the whole thing with foil and cooking an additional 10 minutes which made them come out perfect without the tops burning. Would definitely make this again!

This really tasted like a chicken pot pie without the crazy crust and baked shell. Bf really liked it. I would add some frozen peas/carrots to it next time. I thought the biscuits on top sounded strange but it turned out very tasty (and I finally cooked the chicken right!).

you can precook the chicken which i did and spiced with garlic salt and pepper. when i made the sauce i skipped the olives but used chopped onion and as well as milk i added some sour cream for a bit of a tang. if you don't want to precook add the biscuits the last 20 mins as i cooked the dish about an hour. turned out wonderful

The whole family loved this dish. We thought it was so good we made it again to impress at a "potluck" dinner. We've never given green olives a chance until now and are glad we did! THIS IS A NEW FAMILY FAVORITE!!
