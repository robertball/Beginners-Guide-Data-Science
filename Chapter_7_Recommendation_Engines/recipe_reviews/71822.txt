Very, very good.  This is going into regular rotation in our household...fabulous lunch!  I used other's reviews and added hard boiled eggs and I also marinated the tuna in the dressing while I cut up the veggies.  Very flavorful and very filling!!!!

This is a very eye-catching and yummy meal. It's also very filling. It's easy to take to work - whether you make it there or make it in the morning and bring it. I really liked it - it's a nice change from the same ol' salad that I'm sick of.

not bad...I liked it better when I put it on toast and broiled it until the cheese melted.

Really delicious. It was easy to make and enjoyed it enough that I plan on making it again. I added  a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar to the dressing, but other than that I kept the recipe exactly as written.

We thought the salad combination was quite good and very pretty.  I'd add a sliced boiled egg next time.  Not so wild about the dressing.  Found it to be a little too lemony for my taste.  Next time I think I'd make my own oil & vinegar combo.

Light dinner, easy to fix.   Lacked the wow factor for us, though.

Yummy salad.

Use a pinch less lemon juice, marinade the tuna in the dressing for a few minutes while you are chopping the veggies and pile on the pepper!

Excellent! My husband and I prefer this salad more than the South Beach Tuna Salad.  We live in Germany so if there are others on SB living here, we found it very easy to make this salad using the "Feta Snack" from the Lidl with Feta cubes and Kalmatata olives, its perfect size for two servings!

This is one of my all time favorite salads.  I make it nearly every day and take it to work for lunch.  I've made the dressing in the recipe but also frequently use a balsamic vinegarette. Can't go wrong no matter what dressing you use. People at work think I'm a gormet cook because my salads look so good.

Good salad!  I didn't have red pepper but otherwise followed the recipe with minor tweaks.  Cut the Dijon to 1 teaspoon and used 1/2 teaspoon of dried tarragon instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons of fresh. Also...I was making one salad.  I used four ounces of tuna and the full amount of dressing.  My head of romaine had exactly sixteen leaves, so 1/16 would have been one leaf. Needless to say, I used much more than that!  (It was probably a 'heart' instead of head, I guess.) I'm surprised that no other reviews mentioned the amount of lettuce.  I fill up on veggies, especially lettuces, when I'm watching calories.  I will fer sure make this again over the summer, especially as I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.

Quick and easy to throw together. Didn't have feta on hand and not a lover of tarragon, so I just cheated and used my favorite bottled Lite Ceasar Dressing and I thought it was pretty good.

This salas was delicious! I made it with fresh tuna instead of canned tuna. I also had to double the dressing recipe because it didn't seem to be enough for a meal for 2 people. I will definitely be making this again.

This dish was a wonderful Sunday afternoon lunch.  The Dijon I used was a little to strong, so I suggest you use a mild version.  My 8 year old son loved it too, but since he is not on the South Beach Diet I added a little honey to his dressing to tone down the Dijon.

This was surprisingly good. My husband even thought so, and he's not too into healthy food. Will definitely make again. Thank you!
