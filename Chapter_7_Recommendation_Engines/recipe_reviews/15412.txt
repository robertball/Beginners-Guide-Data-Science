The first words out of my husband's mouth when he took a bite were "Mmmmm!  Wow!"  I think that the earlier reviewers who found this recipe "bland" must have done something wrong because the chops were SO FULL OF FLAVOR!!  I accidentally added a whole 1 cup of chicken broth, but I would recommend that everyone make this "mistake"--it made enough creamy sauce to serve on the side!  Some other changes:  I substituted marsala cooking wine for the sherry, added some dried crushed rosemary to the flour mixture, used dried minced onions instead of onion powder, and ommited the fresh onions (since I didn't have any)--the recipe still turned out wonderfully!  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  Thank you Stacey!!  :-)

It was ok, but I thought it was bland, no spice to it!  My husband is on Weight Watchers, so I reduced the oil to 3 tbs., but I think that's still too much.  My husband said to not make it again!

Husband and I loved this dish.  I added crushed, dried rosemary, dill, and taragon to the flour mixture and it added wonderful flavor.  As suggested by others, I added extra stock and sherry and made a delicious gravey.  Served the pork with roast garlic mashed potatoes and a salad.  We will definitely have this again.

Wonderful dish!! Thanks, the only thing I would do next time is add more rosemary! The chops where very moist and the coating was awesome. I am not a big pork chop lover, but these changed my mind. Thanks again!!!!

You're right, Stacey, incredibly good!  I used dried rosemary, and doubled the sauce.  I also removed the chops once they reached 160 degrees, boiled the sauce down some and then finished it with about 3 T. butter.  Mmmmmm-mmmm! (The chops didn't take 25 min. to cook, more like 15 total.)

This came out great.  I did make alot of changes to the recipe cause I didn't have some of the ingredients and add extras as some other reviewers suggested. I made it with whole wheat flour since I didn't have white flour.  Also added about 1 cup more of the chicken broth only cause I wanted the chops more juicy and wanted to make extra gravy with the left over juices. I also used minced onion since I didn't have onion powder and added dried rosemary to the flour. Added 1t. of tarragon to flour.  Also used about an extra T. of dry sherry and an extra T. of fresh rosemary to add to the chops. Served this chops with mashed potatoes and green beans using the extra juices of the chops to make a gravy.  Tip always try to eat chops hot cause if you let them get cold they start to get dry.

These were very good and flavorful, a nice alternative to the standard porkchop-in-cream-of-mushroom-soup  thing.  Because others complained of this being bland, I made my chicken broth by boiling 1/2 cup water and then adding a whole chicken bouillan cube to it (since one cube is supposed to make one cup of broth--this way the broth was twice as flavorful).  I then omitted the salt in the recipe.  I also only used about half the oil (I just pour in enough to cover the bottom of my skillet, and 4 Tbsp was just way too much).  Everyone enjoyed these, and I'll make them again.

Try reducing the oil to 2 tablespoons, adding a bit more if needed. Try tarragon    instead of rosemary.  Also, depending on your pork, simmer 1/2 to 1 hr. for really tender chops.

Very good! I used a poultry seasoning instead of the rosemary, used red wine instead of sherry and thickened the sauce with cornstarch as suggested.

Moist tender chops with a very subtle combination of flavors. We enjoyed this very much. I love recipes that contain chicken broth, sherry or white wine, garlic and onion powders. But Wow, the rosemary was an unexpected wonderful flavor. I doubled the rosemary and the sauce. Reduced it down and added some butter at the end. Great recipe, Stacey.

I halved this recipe for the two of us, but I did not halve the broth ,sherry and rosemary.  I'm glaad I didn't too because there would have been no sauce at all.  This was a tasty, easy, quick way to do pork chops and chardonnay can also be used instead of the sherry for a slightly different but good flavor.

Absolutely delicious. Followed the directions step by step. I used red wine vinegar instead of the sherry, and dried rosemary instead of fresh, but it was great. My husband and 4 year old loved it. My husband kept mentioning how it tasted like it was made in the restaurant.

Really loved this recipe! I think the chicken broth is really what gives it the most flavor. I used 3/4 inch thick chops and they came out on the dry side, so next time I make them I'll simmer them for five minutes on a side instead of ten and five. I also used garlic salt and onion salt instead of the powders because that's what I had on hand, so I just didn't add salt by itself. Turned out great!

My husband and 2 year old LOVEd this dish! My 2 year old ate almost a WHOLE pork chop. The rosemary and sherry added wonderful flavor to the pork chops, which were tender and moist. I served this dish with "Early morning Oven Roasted New Potatoes" and the dishes really complimented each other. I took the other reviewers' ideas and doubled the rosemary and chicken broth, added flour at the end of its cooking time and stirred the extra gravy into the potatoes. YUM!

* Can I just add that it's so frustrating to see people rate dishes low when they didn't follow the directions or use the key ingredients?? No wonder you don't like it when you eliminate and substitute things!!!

This was really simple to throw together and let do it's thing and had a good flavor as well.  Next time I'll caramelize my onions before placing them on top of the chops, but aside from that, I think this one is a keeper.  Anytime I can find a chop recipe without having to use cream of mushroom (or the like), I am a happy camper! Thanks!!

Delicious! I doubled the broth and sherry as others have mentioned, and since I didn't have any onion powder on me, I added some extra garlic powder and fine-chopped a large shallot. We served it with white rice, boiled in a mix of cranberry and apple juices. This will definitely become part of our regular repertoire.

First time ever and it was a great hit.  Took some advice from some of your raters and added extra broth and rosemary.  I also simmered for an hour and you could cut them with a fork. Will definately make them again.

Yumm! Made this one pretty much "as written". Only major changes were omissions -- left out the dried parsley because I rarely see the point  of that herb and pepper 'cause my husband doesn't like it and I can add as much as I want when serving!  :)  Oh, and I substituted Marsala for the sherry.  We both really enjoyed it. Served over some garlic sauted haricots verts with a salad along side (yep, watching those carbs).  This would also be DELICIOUS over smashed potatoes, rice or orzo. Will certainly be making this one again. Thanks, Staceyo!!

I followed the directions completely, and found that there was very little difference in the taste of the pork chops. If I make this again, I'll probably change the ingredients. My wife said that she prefers chops that are baked or grilled.

This is a great recipe!!  I've made a couple changes just to keep the health value up.  I've left out the flour, instead I just rub the other ingredients into the chops.  Then instead of using all of the veg. oil I replaced it with olive oil and only use enough to cover my pan but enough to keep the meat from burning.  Other than the flour and oil I've left the recipe alone.  It's wonderful just the way it is or with the changes I've made!  Have fun with this one!

This was a wonderful recipe. The flavor was wonderful. The only changes I made are as follows: boneless chops, 3/4 C chicken broth, 2 tbl. red wine (I didn't have any sherry), 1 tbl. olive oil and 1/2 tsp. dry rosemary. Now looking at the ingredients, I realized that I forgot the onions! That would have made it even better! I served it over rice, and the sauce was wonderful over it.

It was delicious! And very easy to make.  This should get a 5 star but I don't particularly like rosemary. I made it for my husband who loves rosemary and he gives it a 5 star.  I will definitely make this again and I may subsitute rosemary with oregano or thyme.

This was a very good recipe.  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner at my house.  The sauce is great.  Especially good over grilled pork tenderloin.

This was very bland.  I probably won't make this again.  Can't see any way, even based on other suggestions, that this would be any better.  I made it exactly as directed but found it bland and uninteresting.  The chops were tender, but that's about all that was good.

I have made this recipe several times and I've affectionately labelled it "Rockin' Chops". I hated onions all my life but wanted to test myself and this was the first recipe that made me suddenly love them. I just wanted to thank you Stacey for the recipe, it's so easy and one of my definite favorites.

Wonderful!!  I didn't have any rosemary on hand so simply used italian seasoning...with great success.  I have no idea how anyone would think this dish is "bland"...the chops are full-flavored and moist.  I also doubled the sauce and reduced it with a touch of cornstarch toward the last 5 mins.

This was delicious! The pork was very tender, flavourful, moist and juicy eventhough they were about an inch thick and those tend to be tough. Definately a keeper

This recipe was fast and good although not exceptional.  I added some paprika and black pepper to the flour for the chops, and cut the oil by half.  The rosemary taste with the sherry was pleasant, and I would be tempted to add a bit of cornstarch and water to create a gravy next time I make this.  This paired well with garlic mashed potatoes for a meal that's good for weeknights.  I would look for ways to add flavor because this was a bit bland in my opinions, perhaps bell peppers with the onion would be good.

The pork was very flavorful and moist and the sauce was delicious!! My boyfriend absolutely loved it and he's super hard to please because his parents own a Country Restaurant.  I made a few minor changes.  I cut the amount of oil in half per others suggestions and I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of vegetable.  I also used dried rosemary instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand.  I served it with Cream Cheese Mashed Potatoes and Parmesian Asparagus.  I will definately be making this again...yummy!!

It was ok, this was the 2nd time we have made this and it seems like the meat is not that tender.  Probably is my fault for cooking too long.  We liked the flavors though.

Solid 4 stars.  You may want to use 3 TBSP of oil out of the 4.  Quite tasty.  And the chops cooked up very tender.

I used about 1 tbs of olive oil and omitted the salt.  I would have added salt at the table if it were needed but I didn't think it was.  Unfortunately, my chops were a little tough but the onions were excellent.

We loved the onions (I used half a big sweet onion but wished I'd sliced the whole thing!).  Half-inch boneless chops, dried rosemary and cornstarch (ran out of flour).  Definitely not boring!

This was a huge hit with hubby, small kids and a teenager.  Made sauce like earlier suggestions which was yummy tossed into baked new potatoes.  Chop rosemary very fine for those who don't like its texture.

Very yummy.  I doubled the amount of liquid so there would be lots of gravy, halved the amount of onion (not a big onion fan) and added a dash of thyme.  It was an easy recipe to make and follow.

I didn't think this recipe was all that flavorful.  I used very thick pork chops, and probably shouldn't have, because they didn't come out all that tender.  Sorry.

This is a flavorful recipe for pork chops.  I did as a previous review suggested and reduced the sauce at the end & added a little butter.  Then we spooned sauce over the chops at the table.

Very tasty! I'm not a pork fan, and I enjoyed it. Served it to my parents ... dad loved it, mom said it has too much rosemary (but she's hard to please and really hates things that aren't near-bland, so interpret as you will). I used a whole stick of rosemary instead of chopping it the second time around, and removed the stick about halfway through to reduce the rosemary flavor to her taste. Sad but true ... mummy dearest always wins.

No major changes, except the second time I made it, I carmelized the onions first. Blackening is too much, but get them nice and brown and a tiny bit crispy, and it adds so much texture along with just a little sweetness. It really improved the mouth-feel, because the one thing this dish lacks is texture.

We really didn't care for this recipe.  I even went back to recipe to verify I did everything correct.   I did you olive oil and I apparently didn't brown the chops enough because the coating turned to mush when I added the liquid.  With so many good review perhaps this was just me, but I won't be making this again.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted great! I used boneless pork chops instead of thick pork chops with the bone. Will definitely make again. It's a keeper!

I felt like Wolfgang Puck after this meal, it was soooo good. I used Port because it was what I had on hand. A Great meal for impressing.

I found the flavor to be very mild, too mild for my taste. My husband however, liked them.

These were amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, and they were so delicious. My husband requested them for next week, as well. I used very thick pork chops, which came out tender and juicy, and even the onions were yummy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Was looking for a new recipe to make like what I saw but their was one thing that I wouldn't do with this. Pork should be cooked to 145 not 160 degrees. Which will help keep the pork moist and tender.

Good, but rather boring. I probably should have served it with something more creative.

Super easy and delicious! I'm always looking for something different but not overly time consuming for dinner. This was perfect.

Despite flouring and well browning the chops, they were slimy. All four of us agreed. I did use grape seed oil as the vegetable oil and drained it off.  I will try with my variations.  Just pan browning the chops including the sides to render the fat, then the top and bottom with seasoning on them.  Also, the sherry was very understated.  For a recipe with Sherry in the name, I'd add more than double.  Timing was on target.

This was an easy, uncomplicated week night dinner. I also reduced the oil to 2 tbsps. I used Port wine as that's what I had in the house. Timing was right on. Very simple flavors that stand up to a spicy or more complicated side dish.  I served it with scalloped potatoes and I did like that it wasn't very "saucy". However, I do think I would double the sauce for certain side dishes. Thank you Stacyo for a new dinner idea.

Followed several recommendations and it worked out well. Used less oil, added dried tarragon and dried rosemary (chopped fine) to dredge. Sauteed onions first then added them back in for the simmer stage with full branches of rosemary (easier to remove at end).  Added bouillon cube and doubled the broth. did not have sherry but it was fine without. Chops were tender and had good flavor.

I FOLLOW this recipe with bone-in chops, boneless chops and thick chops.  It's always delicious!  After quickly browning, doubling chicken broth, sherry, rosemary (and adding white pepper) I throw it all in the crock pot.  Voila! Yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

It turned out pretty good with minor alterations, but my husband wasn't too happy about hte rosemary being all over it.
