My family loves it! The only change I made was adding some extra chicken stock. I will be making this again.

It was very good!!!  I doubled this recipe and it was enough to feed a party of 25 people!  I am rating this recipe a 4 1/2 star because I added added a package of taco seasoning to add a little more flavor.  Everyone really liked it!

Got rave reviews at a work luncheon. I did make a few changes based on other reviews and the fact that I doubled the recipe. I used 4 large cloves of garlic, substituted one can of tomatoes with fire-roasted tomatoes, and started with one package of instant potatoes  with applewood bacon (couldn’t find the chipotle flavor) and slowly added about another quarter package until desired thickness. I did add about 1 Tbs of reduced sodium taco seasoning to balance out the flavors. Soup is always better a day or two later so make it ahead if you can. Would definitely make it again.

3x I've had it, but first time I've made it myself and it's still delicious as ever! I used a smoked applewood bacon instant potato instead though. I added pepper, garlic salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper to it as well. Probably will add a bit more chicken broth to it to make it more soup like next time. Either way it is a delicious recipe!

I loved this! I had to eliminate some things that my family didn’t like but I added a taco seasoning that I made from Allrecipes, and it was sooooo good.

Decent by the original recipe but if following it your going to want more umph. I read the reviews before making. glad I did. I used an entire deli chicken, more broth, could not find the exact potatoes. added four cheese potatoes, two onions, and a pack and a half of taco seasoning. I also added a tad more salt. felt like it needed it.

love the flavor but will add more chicken stock next time. It turned out very pasty. I am a novice cook though so will try again...
