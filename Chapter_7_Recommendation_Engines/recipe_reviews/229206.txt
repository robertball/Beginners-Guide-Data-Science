I was a little more liberal than usual in how I followed this recipe. I cooked up the shallots and garlic as directed, but then I decided to put in 3 T ready-made pesto, and 2/3 c. heavy cream (because I only had a total of 1 cup). While that reduced, I cooked the chicken, though I decided to take some out and set it aside because it looked like too much chicken per sauce. Then I added the rest of the cream to that mix and reduced it another 15 min. We already had angel hair from the night before, so we used that, though I would use a smaller, chunkier pasta next time. overall, it was great.
