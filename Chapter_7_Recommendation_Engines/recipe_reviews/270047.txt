I did not have Farro so used brown rice and left out Jalapenos.  It was good and my kids ate.

This looked and sounded delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.   I will never make it again!  Farro is a difficult grain but this dish would be better with rice or orzo.

This is a really good, and essentially easy recipe for a busy weeknight dinner. My family loves bok choy, so I added a good deal more of it to the recipe, doubled up on the garlic and ginger, and used one jalapeño, seeds and all. Since fresh garlic and ginger tend to “disappear” in a dish, the additional added good flavor to the chicken and bok choy. The farro gave the dish body. This could be used as a vegetarian dish by substituting firm tofu for the chicken. As a caterer I will definitely try this on our vegetarian clients.
