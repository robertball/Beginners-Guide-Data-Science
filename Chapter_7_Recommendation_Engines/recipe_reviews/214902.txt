Good and simple recipe for Gazpacho, my sister-in-law makes it this way. I make it the classical way, I use about 1 lb. of tomatoes, 2 cloves of garlic and no onion, plus a good sized piece of stale bread soaked in cold water added to the veggies. That gives it more consistency and makes it a bit thicker. Another spanish variant called Sopa Marbella adds 2 or 3 carrots, giving it a nice slightly sweet taste.

Quick and easy to make perfect for the end of a long hot summer day. I added a small amount of garlic and some siracha sauce for a bit of a kick the second time around, but even made exactly to the recipe, its really good. My pregnant tummy can't get enough.

I did not enjoy this recipe at all. All I could taste was the onions.

save the spoon and serve this in a glass with a sprig of cilantro.  (we added that and fresh cracked pepper.)  this will be a weekly staple around here!

Used exact ingredients and measurements.  If I used this recipe again, I would only blend half the ingredients, so some of the distinct flavors would be retained and I would also add tomato juice to give it a stronger base. But there are other recipes on this site that I prefer;  the only advantage to this one is the short ingredient list.

Perfect recipe. I made it with different colored heirloom tomatoes instead of plum, used a red onion instead of green onion and I added the water sparingly after blended everything. I doubled the recipe and used a green pepper and a red pepper. Came out great. Perfect for a party.

As a member of the USN,  I first tasted Gazpacho In Barcelona, Spain and immediately hooked.  Forever trying to duplicate the taste (near impossible) I experienced in that great city.  This recipe comes close.  I still travel to Spain from time to time  and always sample whatever restaurant I am dining in their rendition of Gazpacho.  Nothing better than being out all day,  arrive home and take the pitcher of Gazpacho out of the fridge and savor the cool flavors of my concoction.  I do add cilantro though.

I love gazpacho but I found this very bland.  I tried this because I was looking for a quicker to make version, but I'm sticking with my  preferred version from the Gasparilla Cookbook (Junior League of Tampa.)

Added 2 branches of  celery. I find that 6 tomatoes was not enough. They are fresh from the farm, so I added 2
To say it takes 15 min is a stretch took me much longer I guess I don’t work at a chef’s speed

This was quick and easy without a lot of ingredients, which is what I was looking for. I found it a bit bland, however. With a little garlic, hot sauce and lime juice, I love it. If I had cilantro, I would have tried that, too.

Fresh and light. I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar as suggested, and topped ours with some diced cucmber for crunch and a tablespoon of nonfat Greek yogurt to give it some zip. A nice light summer dinner with a salad and bread.

If you are one of us who drink out of the pickle jar, you will love this! I strained thru  a sieve to make more of a juice...YUM! May also go really good with beer (if you like red beer) or nice spicy start for bloodymarys! Flavor is stronger the next day, oh yeah!

Really simple and tasty. I doubled everything except the spring onions, and added 2 small cloves of garlic and half a serrano chile pepper.  Definitely better than the last few gazpacho recipes I tried!

This was a great addition to a fresh summer salad. We served it in small cups to drink as an appetizer.

Great recipe with a few modifications.  I only used 1/2 red pepper and 2 green onions.  I also added some fresh cilantro while I was blending the ingredients and tsp of sugar to cut the acidity.  I serve with sour cream and cut up cucumbers for garnish.  The longer it chills, the better the flavor.
