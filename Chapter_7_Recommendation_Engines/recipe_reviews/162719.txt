I made this last night after a long. hard. day. 

Tasty. Very, very tasty. On my second, 
I doubled the Crown, just to make it stronger. I like my glasses to get drunk before I do.

Thanks, ambibambi. You made my night better. I forgot about my troubles, that's for sure.

Went down very, very smooth! I thought it was like drinking chocolate milk with a shot of root beer, which sounds weird but is very good. I measured everything exactly, my only sub was to use a different whiskey (cheap Kentucky bourbon), which is what I enjoy in my usual cocktail of choice. Loved it, thanks for a great recipe! Update: made again, this time with Kraken. Wow. Even my boyfriend said 'Interesting,' and not, 'Ew' like every other cocktail.

I love root beer, milk, Kahlua... But the combination was a bit much for me. I don't regret trying it, but next time I'll use a little less whiskey or perhaps try rum instead since rum is more palatable to me. Overall, a fun drink that's a nice change. Thanks for sharing, Ambibambi!

We thought the original was good, but we thought a natural progression would be to add ice cream... This too is delicious.

This was pretty good but the root beer was a little too dominant for me, next time I will try using less.

A little bland as written.  Needed to increase the amount of liquor to give it a little more flavor and kick.

These go down so smooth and easily. They taste alot like a root beer float, but will make it hard to walk afterward. I have substituted rum for the whiskey with great success. Very tasty!

Good but I prefer Canadian Club to Crown as it is much smoother. Will make again!

Wow... I needed a drink and this hit the spot. Reminded me of a rootbeer float only deadly. One was all I could handle (I know I'm weak). Thanks for the drink ambibambi and thanks Lambchop'sMom for suggesting it.

Certainly fine enough on a hot day! But utlimately I thought it tasted a bit too much like a watered down Black Russian or a Brown Cow with root beer in it!

This looks like a great drink. I'll have to go out to get some kaluha and try it. 

I love the reference to Canadian whisky! Up here we call it rye.

I made these with a cheaper brand of Canadian whiskey. Really good, I'll try with rum. One last thing, both CC and Crown Royal should be enjoyed straight up or with ice.
