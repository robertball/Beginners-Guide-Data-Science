Thank you, Pippy for this great recipe.  I admit, I didn't have fresh parsley,and I added green pepper, but it was fabulous.  I made it in honor of a guest's request, not because I'm a fan, but that has changed.  Maybe it was the fact that I used excellent sherry?  Anyway, it was delicious.  And after dinner, it looked less appetizing as a leftover, so I whirled it up and now I enjoy a wonderful pate.  Thanks again!

Tyhis is fabulous!!!   Doesn't even taste like liver.  Thyme seems to be the key flavor to make this out standing!

I am not a great fan of liver, but my wife loves it, so for her I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did not have French bread so used some Sour Dough that I had on hand, and it worked just fine.
I also did as Dr. Shaw , and turned the left-overs into a Pate for the wife, as she loves that also.
This is definately a keeper and will probably make it for the next family gathering just to turn it into the Pate just for the pre dinner appitizers.

Loved it!  I have made this 3 times so far.  I once substituted chicken broth for the sherry and wasn't nearly as good.

I thought I would try something new on my family.  Needless to say that all 5 of us do not like liver.  We ended up getting pizza instead.

A good solid liver and onion recipe. I used a blush wine as I had no sherry. Good flavor. Next time I will add mushrooms.

It was a bit bland. I added reduced balsamic,  1 tbsp mushroom soup powder ,hot n sweet sauce, hot cayenne, boiled potatoes,Worcester sauce n brandy. Then it tasted good.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made it as written, except I used dried parsley, as I did not have any fresh.  Take the time to make the croutons - it is so worth it!
