I first followed this recipe exactly, and found it needed something more.  I ended up adding significantly more vinegar, as well as a splash of lime juice.  I personally, would have also liked the addition of a diced jalapeno, though we didn't have any on hand.  (Next time...)  GREAT base recipe, with lots of room for modifications.

S is an amazing recipe, light and simple.  I added jalape√±o juice and used a Mexican cheese blend and backed it at 350 for about ten minutes.  It was a keeper for sure

I put slices of avocado on top instead of in the black bean mix so that we could eat left overs without the avocado turning brown. These are delicious!!

Little salty for my taste but I can easily adjust that for next time, and a little lime also goes well with the burrito. I used an oven instead of a microwave so if you don't have access to a microwave, putting in a burrito(s) for like 3-5 minuets at 350 works just as well. 10/10 would make again

This taste great. Left out the veggie oil. The tomatoes had juice which took the place of the oil. I did olives to the dish.

Instead of using canned corn, I steamed frozen corn to add to more of a fresh flavor.  I also added some lime juice to prevent the avocados from turning too fast.   Also, I think I would use two less avocados next time to reduce the fat and calorie count.  Lastly, I would make up some fresh pico to top the taco with.

As is, this recipe lacks some real flavor.  But as I read from other's ratings, I increased the red wine vinegar and added lime juice.  It was excellent with those additions.  I would recommend adding those ingredients to taste.

This was good. After tasting it as written I decided that this needed more vinegar but that was the only change I made.

I didn't have black beans so I used chicken. That way, I needed salsa.
