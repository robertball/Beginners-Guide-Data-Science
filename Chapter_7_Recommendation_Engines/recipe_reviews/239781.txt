I'm not really a fan of butternut squash, but roasting veggies makes them all delicious so I gave this a try, minus the kale because the husband refused to eat it. It's a bit time consuming with the separate roasting of the sprouts & squash, but worth it in the end if you have the time. You could also roast the veggies the night before and hold them in the fridge until you're ready to put the dish together. 
The Barilla Plus Farfalle was great. With all that protein this dish is a great choice for a meatless Monday meal. 
5 out of 5 kids in my house ate this, so it's a winner. The sprouts are the star of this one, so if you love them, then you'll like this meal.

I made this with half of the indicated pasta, and it was plenty, IMO. I used romaine lettuce in place of the kale because I didn't have any but otherwise followed the ingredients. The vegetables can be roasted at the same time, but you will need to pull the sprouts well before the squash is finished. I am not entirely certain why the pasta water needed to be reserved here. I know that it is supposed to make sauce "stick" better to the pasta, but there really wasn't a sauce in this case. It didn't necessarily detract from anything, but I'm also not sure if it added anything. If you made this with regular farfalle pasta, this dish might go great with some pecans or other toasted nuts, but the Plus Pasta by Barilla packs the protein your body needs.

While I love all the roasted veggies in the ingredients separate, I'm not sure I love them all together in this dish.  I think the Brussels sprouts overpowered the flavor a little. I would have preferred a more mild winter vegetable with the butternut squash. If i made this again, I would leave out the Brussels Sprouts.  I did roast onion with the veggies, and that was a nice addition. I also shaved the Parmesan and added to the top of each plate along with some chopped fresh parsley.  I did like the Barilla® Plus pasta.  Very good texture and how can you beat the 17g of protein per serving?

I made with an enhanced rotell pasta, otherwise per directions. Came out well, with a nice roasted flavor. Using a good cheese is important.

YUM!  This is  a great dish for a meatless Monday or as a side dish with meat.  We couldn't find the Barilla Plus Farfalle so we used mini farfale.  I'm anxious to try the Plus though. I found at the last minute that I was out of garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder.  I also added a sprinkle of cayenne for a slight touch of heat.  I ended up adding some butter at the end to make the sauce more unctuous.  It was delicious!

Used a yellow squash not butternut. Added salt and pepper to veggies before roasting. Added mushrooms and some green onions to garlic. Very good flavor. Will definitely make again.

I used vegan cheese to replace the Parmigiano Cheese but it still turned out fabulously delicious!

This was a bit time consuming, but well worth it on a Friday night. I followed the recipe as written except I used shredded Parmesan instead of grated, and additional garlic as a personal preference. I thought this was absolutely wonderful - the textures and flavors were great. Left the cheese off my son's portion to make it vegan. I may try adding mushrooms or onions to the kale while sautéing next time. Definitely easy to alter this recipe to your taste.

My husband and I just loved this!  Our only complaint was that the kale is pretty tough if you only cook it for a short time.  We'd opt for cooking it a bit longer (or maybe separately before putting it in with the dish).  The kids were super keen on this with the harder kale, but I think with it softer and cut up even smaller, they wouldn't been more into it.  I'd make this one again, though, for sure.  It's very sweet and a great comfort food (only a healthier comfort food)!

Great recipe!  Instead of EVOO, I used avocado oil.  When I sautéed the garlic I used about 2 T cocoanut oil.  It gave it a nice flavor.  Also, since I love garlic, I used 4 cloves instead of 1.  I did not have the bow tie pasta, so I used a rotini type pasta.  All in all, I give the recipe a thumbs up.

I didn't have any squash so I went with kale, Brussels sprouts and onions - delicious!! I used a little veggie broth for the liquid and this was great. I could see adding walnuts like another reviewer suggested (or even mushrooms!) This is gonna be great for lunch this week!
