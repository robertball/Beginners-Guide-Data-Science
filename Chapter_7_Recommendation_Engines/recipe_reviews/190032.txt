I made this recipe last night and it was a big hit. I did however make a few minor changes. I didn't cook this in the crockpot as the recipe states. I sauteed the green pepper, onion, and celery in two tablespoon of olive oil. I sliced the sausage and cooked them for 10 minutes in a separate pan. I added all the ingredients to the veggies and mixed everything together well. I added the sausage last and let all the ingredients cook together for about 45 minutes - 1hr. Once it was done we ate it over rice. I used red onion instead of the white onion. I also added 1 tbs of cumin. I will definitely make this again.

I started making this for a softball team that I cook for on Sundays.  Then for my sisters and brother.  As of yet I havent' found anyone that doesn't like these beans with sausage.  I use dry beans and soap them two days and rinse about 4 times during that soaking time.  I also go for the slow and low method, low heat and up to 12 hours in the slow cooker.  Melt-in-your-mouth GOODNESS!!

This recipe was Awesome! I made it in the slow cooker. I cooked the sausage whole, then cut the sausage into medallions and browned them before adding them. I also cooked it on high for the first 2 hours and only cooked it for a total of 5 hours. It turned out really tasty, a little spicy, and perfect with rice. It can be kept for a long time int he fridge and it feezes well too! I would definitely recommend this one, even for kids! Get some fiber in them!

I used andouille sausage and it really was very good. I wouldn't recommend andouille unless you do like things somewhat spicy. The meal was thoroughly enjoyed by the 4 adults last night. I did use 8 ounces of tomato sauce since I had only 8 ounce cans.

One of my family's favorite recipes - I've been making it for years, I think I originally got it from Southern Cooking. The only thing I do differently is cut the sausage into smaller pieces, leave out the bouillion, reduce water by 1/2 and increase cayenne to 1 teaspoon. I make this at least once a month and it makes your mouth water all day while it's cooking.

This is a good recipe. I liked that it offered many of the flavors of traditional beans & rice or gumbo without the added fat that comes from making a roux. I found the end product to be a bit too saucy for my tastes but that's probably because I increased the vegetables & they cooked out more liquid, so that's something to consider if, like me, you wind up increasing the veggies. I halved this recipe; 1 sausage, 2 beans, 1 whole onion, 4 stalks celery, 1 whole pepper, half a can of tomato product (in my case diced tomatoes) (and seasonings, but we're talking volume here) fit neatly into my 3 quart crockpot, with a little bit of room to spare but not a whole lot. Thanks for the recipe!

Slow Cooker BB & Sausage Haiku: "I give this three stars. Husband says 'five stars for me!' We'll call it a four." I think 6 hrs in the crock pot was too long and resulted in everything frequently drying out, requiring me to add a splash of red wine. (If I make this again, I'll go with a can of diced tomatoes instead.) I should've just gone w/ my instinct (and rumbling stomach at the delicious aroma that it emitted), and pulled it from the crock pot early. Idk, I like my beans to be beans, and not to disappear into a thick moosh, which is sort of what happened here. Don't get me wrong, the taste was pretty good (I also added a generous TB of Josyln's "Creole Seasoning Blend"), but I think I'd rather stick to a beans/rice dish on the stovetop. The thickness of it; however, was nicely complimented by a blanket of lightly-seasoned brown rice beneath it.

This smelled soooo good while cooking.  I used chic broth instead of bullion, and 1 can of kidney beans and one czn of black beans.  I'd make it again, the kids were not fans, though...

I loved this recipe. It really tastes like a great southern style dish full of flavor, I made some dirty rice instead of white rice. Will make again very soon.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I did it Cajun style with chicken stock and diced tomatoes.  But it is still a new favorite at our house.  I used dried beans, so I put it on in the morning in the crock pot and when it's time for supper, I make some rice and we're good to go.

Found this to be a great cold weather dish. Very filling and flavorful. I used Johnsonville Andouille style sausage for the smoked sausage. I believe this made it a little more spicy than reg. smoked sausage would have been. That was the only thing I changed

In the words of my 9 yr old "this is the bomb".  I did not make this in the crock pot, instead sauted the sausage (I used turkey sausage) in my dutch oven, removed and sauted veggie's with a little extra EVOO.  I then added the remaining ingredients using one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and two cans of black beans and one can of drained  chili beans (it's what I had on hand) then added the sausage.  I simmered for about 45 min-1r,  The result was a thick rich sauce I served over rice.  Excellent and easy recipe, thanks for the post.  I will definatly be making this again.

This recipe was delicious! Other than the fact I added a little too much extra cayenne pepper for the little ones, we all loved it! Will make this one again and again. Great way to use sausage.

This was absolutely fabulous. I had never cooked dried black beans before so used this recipe to try. Also instead of using slow cooker, I cooked them on the stove top. I think 6 hours w/canned beans would have been way too long. I used dried beans & it only took 3 hours. Instead of tomato sauce, I used  diced tomatoes. (That's what I had on hand). Also added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch during last 20 minutes cooking time to thicken sauce. Served over rice favored with lemon pepper & parsley. Will add this to my winter dinners.

I love this recipe. I like to cook from dried beans and am always looking for flavor variations. This cooks in a skillet with diced tomatoes instead of tom. sauce.  I like to use spicy smoked sausage the best and serve with rice.

4 and 1/2 stars really.  Great meal.  The only change I made was I didn't put the beans in until a few hours before it was dinnertime.  That way they didn't become smushy.  But yum, yum, yum.

Great tasting and easy.  I didn't have enough sausage so I added chunks of rump roast and didn't have smoked sausage so added 1 t. liquid smoke.  Also didn't have enough bell pepper so added some ripe jalapenos.  Used half pinto beans and no celery.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that this recipe is also highly adaptable to what one has on hand!

I have been making this for years, it's great over some white rice. I tend to only use 1 lb of sausage, and buy the smoked ready-to-use and skip the whole browning step. Assemble the night before, pop the cooker on in the morning and come home to a yummy dinner smelling up the place.

Good way to clean out the refrigerator.  Not the most exciting meal, but slow cooker meals always get a thumbs up for being convenient.  I was pressed for time so I didn't brown the sausage first.  And I left out the celery.  I'd make it again.

Not sure how to ask a question - I am making this but wonder why I need to brown the sausage when it is already cooked? I know when I use smoked sausage for jambalaya I don't brown it first, so why is this step necessary? Thanks,

This will make its rounds in our dinner rotatiion for sure.  Great flavor and so easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half (there is only 2 of us) and used 2 whole cans of black beans and 1 1/2 lbs of smoked sausage.  Wonderful recipe-thank you!

I will definitely make this again.  It was a great hit with my boyfriend. He has already asked me to make it again. I used smoked turkey sausage to make it a little lighter. We had it over rice. Nice flavors and spices. Thanks for a great inexpensive recipe.

I was very disappointed in this.  As a previous person noted, it was lacking something.  I followed the recipe -- just cut it in half.  I expected more of a smoky flavor from the sausage, but it just wasn't there.  My husband and I wound up seasoning it with hot sauce just to give it some flavor.

VERY good!  I used turkey sausage and served this over white jasmine rice.  I'll definitely make it again - and maybe add more cayenne pepper next time!!

the only substitution we made was to use spicy ground italian sausage, and dried beans. We enjoyed this as a family, and served it with brown rice.

I admit that I changed this quite a bit, but the result was very yummy. I turned it into a soup, almost like gumbo. I halved the recepe and  added 5 medium potatoes, some chopped carrots, used 1 can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon, 2 c water, left out the green pepper and celery since I didn't have it. Served with parmesan on top. DELISH.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  It thickened up in the last half hour or so of cooking.  I served it over brown rice.  Can't wait for leftovers.  The flavor was good, we didn't think it was all that spicy. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

The picture looked very tempting, and since I had two lean turkey keilbasas in my freezer, I thought I'd try it out. It was great! Slow cooked for 8-10 hrs made everything very tender. I did two cans of black beans and one can of garbanzo beans. Knowing I was serving young children, omitted the spices. Before serving, I saw that the sauce was watery, so I also added a 6oz can of tomato paste. Perfection. My two year old ate it up. Good by itself or over rice or ramen noodles. Let me not forget to mention that I put the keilbasa in frozen and the veggies in raw. No prob.

I have to rate this a 4-star as a good base recipe.  However, with a few adjustments, definitely a 5-star.  Most of the local markets here don't carry true Cajun/Creole/New Orleans ingredients so I have to make do with what is available.  I used 2lbs of hot links, yellow onion, red and yellow bell pepper, beef broth instead of water, beef bouillon cubes (about 4), 3 jalapenos diced, 2 tsp cayenne and a dash of seasoned salt.  I forgot the bay leaves but turns out they weren't needed.  The husband LOVED this and frankly, I agree.  It was flavorful and hearty with a good kick.  I also made mango chutney and corn bread to go with it and the whole meal was to die for awesome.  Next time, I may not rinse the black beans since they sometimes come in a lovely lime juice which might be a good addition.  I did use the black beans with jalapenos though.  Yummy!

I first came across this recipe in a magazine and I love it.  The only changes I've made is doubling the cayenne because we all like it spicy.  I might try the andouille sausage next time as it sounds great

Good basic recipe but a little bland for my taste, so I added some oregano, garlic powder, fresh chopped cilantro, and 1/2 packet of sazon.

This is a great slow cooker meal.  I increased the white and cayenne pepper a little because we like spicey food. Other than that I didn't change a thing.  It had a good amount of liquid but not too much and we served it over rice.

Very good.  Has similar flavors of gumbo.  I too prepared everything in the skillet, only using one pan.  I left out the green peppers and only had 2 cans of black beans on hand, so that's what I used and was sufficient.  We all loved the flavors in this dish.

This is excellent!  It does not need 1 1/2 cups of green pepper, celery and onion.  I put in 2 medium sized onions (chopped), 3 stalks of celery and 1 green pepper (normal sized).  That was perfect, actually, might put 1 less celery stalk.  Over Basmati  rice, this recipe was awesome.  I actually was upset when I looked down and it was all gone!  Served 4 people (2 adults and 2 boys) and have at least 3 - 4 servings left for leftovers.  Which is NICE!

This recipe was so delicious, easy, and flavorful.  I just added more cayenne pepper because we like spicy food.  Mine came out much more soupy/runny than the photo but it still tasted awesome... however it might have been the type of sauce I used.

Very tasty - I followed the recipe but used turkey smoked sausage and served it over rice.  A little salty but I suspect that is from the sausage. Great fast & easy recipe!

Very Tasty.  We added extra cayenne pepper to make it a little more spicy, and used turkey smoked sausage to make it a little bit healthier.  Turned out good!

So I liked this, but felt like it was missing something.  I used broth instead of bouillon, so adding some salt helped a bit. I will definitely make it again and experiment with some additional seasonings.

I skipped the slow cooker and made this on the stove. Browned the sausage, set it aside and cooked the veggies for about 5 minutes with the garlic. I then added everything in and cooked on low for an hour. I did add a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes (partially drained) and some cumin. When you first add everything it looks like there won't be any sauce, but as the beans cook it thickens quite a bit. Served over rice, it was FANTASTIC!

Pretty bullet proof.  I did not brown the sausage prior to cooking and I used andouille sausage.  It was a little runny/soupy but that did not really bother me at all .  I will make this again for sure.

I wanted to try something different and based on the reviews, I gave this recipe a chance to change my day.  Well, like most of the people here, I've made couple of changes. I added 1 tbs olive oil, 2 carrots cut in pieces, 1 potato in squares, corn on a cob cut in 1/4 and added a pinch of salt. Served over white rice. It was a keeper.  The smell in the house during the day were phenomenal. What I would change next time? I would put the sausage to cook the last 30 minutes since I browned it in the pan but leaving the sausage for so long in the crock pot, made it smoochie. I didnt like that but the flavor over all was incredible.

This was fantastic. I substituted 1 cup chicken broth for water and chicken bouillon. I also used 1 lb chorizo and 1 lb andouille sausage in place of smoked sausage since that is all we had. Will make again and again.

This is great. Added two boxes of Zataran's jambalaya mix after cooking the dish. Makes it even better.

Excellent, just as written! Put an extra pinch of cayenne as we love the spice...

Made this recipe for football Sunday. I added a teaspoon of cumin and used a can of rotel instead of the tomato sauce. I put the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and served over white rice. It was a crowd pleaser! Will make again!

Good flavor. Used dry beans ( soaked overnight) sausage got a little mushy...don't cook all day next time. Served over white rice with a dash of hit sauce.

I let it cook overnight, but wasn't quite satisfied with the taste in the morning. I added a fresh minced jalepeno pepper as well as a teaspoon of cumin, which seemed to waken the flavors a bit. Overall it is a nice recipe though...I cooked it for a potluck, and there were no leftovers--always a good sign.

Yum, on a rainy day.  Used 1 pound presoaked dry beans, one pound smoked turkey kielbasa.  The rest of the ingredients were added as written.  Served with cornbread and choice of toppings.  My husband chose shredded cheese.  I chose sour cream and cilantro.  Will make again.  May add cumin next time.  Thank for the recipe and all the input.

A bit spicy for my family. I would cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.

This is very much like red beans and rice.  The soup is good with or w/o the rice.  I cooked it on the stove for about 30 minutes.

Super good and super easy. I used half turkey smoked sausage, and half andouille. I used for cups of black beans that I had in my freezer, and since I didn't have any green peppers I just threw in a small can of diced green chiles. Ours was super spicy, but still delicious. Served over brown rice.

I did not find this seasoned enough.  It was bland.

Loved this.  The spices were just perfect.  I added 3/4 cup chopped cilantro for that extra fresh taste.  We served this over rice and really loved it.

A little runny for my taste, and the sausage didn't quite work for some reason.  Definitely needs work.
