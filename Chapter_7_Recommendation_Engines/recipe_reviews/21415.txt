There are a couple problems with this recipe.  First, the real Skyline chili doesn't have this much chili powder if any at all.  Second and more serious is that it is way too dry, as a couple people here already mentioned.  I have checked a dozen or more Skyline recipes on the internet and most of them mention adding 3 cups or 1 quart of water, which would make the consistancy more like that of Skyline's.  As the recipe is here,  there is not enough liquid, and it is more like a thick paste.  Either this recipe has not been tried by the auther, or she left something out when she typed the recipe.

following this recipe will give you a basic chili. "Cincinnati Chili" (i.e. "Skyline") chili, is much juicier... I would suggest NOT browning the meat first; let it cook in the sauce, stirring constantly. (hint; use a hand-held mixer to finely shred the meat in early cooking stage). Some folks have suggested adding beans to the sauce during cooking - that's not how we do it in Cincy. the basic chili is "garnished" with the addition of beans, finely chopped onions, & finely shredded cheddar cheese. Adding all of these garnishes yields a "4-Way", adding any two = a "3-way", etc. I have never seen olives used as a garnish with this dish, but I suppose that could work - just not authentic! use plenty of cocoa powder for that Cincinnati-caffeine kick.

This is a great recipe but the meat should not be browned. You should mix the dry ingredents with the the liquids and mix in the meat also instead of 2 cans of tomato sause use 1 can of sause and i can of paste, bring to a rolling boil the reduce and simmer for about and hour to hour and a half. the meat will melt in you mouth. Try it like this i promise it's wonderful.

My family loved it.  We recently visited (ok 6 times while on a 3 week vacation) the Hard Times Cafe is Old Town Alexandria Va.  My kids loved the Cincinnati Chili Mac and were amazed it had Cinnamon in it.  I followed some of the recommendations in the comments like adding Cocoa powder.  I added petite diced tomatoes (1/2 a 28oz can), 1/2 a 28 oz can of tomatoe sauce, 1 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, 2 galic cloves, and 1/1/2 tsp cocoa.  I served this with cheese and sour cream.  Yumm!  This kids loved it!!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I grew up in the midwest and this was a staple in our home. My husband is from Southern California and had never heard of this type of chili. He wasn't too crazy about it at first, but now he LOVES it. We have this once a week in winter. This recipes also freezes well (without the noodles) I pile my chili high with cheddar cheese and oyester crackers. In fact, I'm making this tonight for dinner. YUM!!!!!!!

If you are looking for  a true"skyline chili" I will give a few hints that I remember as a child. I worked for Skyline in my teen yrs. I know that they boil meat not fry and also you must add cinnamon and baking unsweetened cocoa. If I remember right there were about 16 different things we added in all. I do know cocoa and cinnamon is a must have. I lived in cincy most of my life. Anyone from that area knows you always add cocoa and cinnamon. I hope this is help for for those of you looking for a true Skyline chili.

My husband absolutely loves this dish and says it tastes just like he remembers Skyline Chili tasting!  However, getting that consistency right perplexes me.  I've made it twice and it seems to come out more like meaty tomato paste rather than like spaghetti sauce.  I even tried cutting the meat portion in half, but it's still very thick and pasty.  Flavorful though!  Thanks!

This isn't really my favorite kind of food, but my husband absolutely loved it!  He mentioned that this chili would also be good used as a sloppy joe type of sandwich filling.  We may try that!

Being born and raised in the Cincinnati area, I grew up on Skyline Chili and I love it. This recipe does not even come close!!! I could go on and on about what is wrong with it but the end result tells the story.

Adding cinnamon doesn't make it Cincinnati style chili. The ground beef should be cooked in with the boiling water, spices and juice, never browned and then you need to use a hand mixer to chop up the ground beef into a finer texture. Chocolate is a must (bakers chocolate...) 

This tasted good, but it wasn't Cincinnati style chili... Look elsewhere if you want something closer.

This recipe lacks some key ingredients that are crucial in making Cincinnati Style Chili.   One being chocolate and the other being nutmeg.    Also you should never ever brown the beef, cook it within the sauce for about 6 hours.   Meat will be cooked throughly and be at the consistancy that makes Cincinnati style chili one of a kind  and famous.

True Cincinnati Chili (Skyline) does not use chili powder or brown the ground beef and onions. Many years ago I read an article from the owner of Skyline. This original greek recipe prides itself in not using chile powder and it boils the meat and onion. Try it you should enjoy the difference.

Guess it's something of an acquired taste...  Tasted like an odd spaghetti sauce to me, not 'chili'.  Not totally bad, but I'll stick to how I'm used to chili.

After reading other reviews I made a lot of changes & it turned out wonderful.  With the tweaks I made to the basic recipe it is very authentic tasting.  I only used 1 lb ground beef & boiled it with the onions.  I used a mixer for meat but I think next time I'll use the food processor. I used only 1 tablespoon of chili powder & added much more cinnamon.  I also added about 3 Tbsp of cocoa powder & little nutmeg.  I used 2 -15 oz cans of tomato sauce.  A lot of work, but worth it! I topped it with onion & cheddar & served it with "Sweet Corn Cake" from this website.

Sorry, this Ohioan has say that while this may be a chili, it's just not really Cincinnati Skyline Chili.   Just a few of the differences:  The meat should be boiled in water (not browned) to break it down to a fine texture; the spice list isn't quite right;  there should be little to no chili powder; and it needs to have cocoa powder added.

I NEVER NEVER NEVER brown the meat. That ruins this for me and anyone who's had the real thing. Boil the meat along with the other incredients and serve over pasta.

I agree wth CKruse's review. Don't brown the meat first (let it brown as it cooks) and use a hand blender (like a Braun) to grind the meat up finely. And for me, I use pinto beans on top of the spaghetti... not mixed in. Plus be sure to use lots of finely-shredded cheddar cheese. It should melt on top of the chili and sort of 'bond' to the chili, so you can cut a bit of the chili and lift it off the plate. (And also, don't put it in a deep cereal-style bowl... serve it on a plate with a bit of a rim to it, so you can cut a bite off and scoop it up. True Cinci chili lovers don't twist their spaghetti on their fork... they cut and lift!

This recipe was great, but we elected to make a few changes to suit our tastes better. 

Firstly, instead of one clove of garlic, we used four. We used around a full tablespoon of cinnamon to make it stand out more in the end. Plus, about a full tablespoon of cayenne was used to give it some more heat. Finally, we cooked the beans in with the chili because it seemed to need some extra liquid. I suppose leaving the beans until serving time would have worked, but everyone wanted them anyway.

Other than those minor changes (and we used fresh pasta) this recipe is fantastic. It picks up Skyline Chili by the shirt collar and smacks it around.

This MUST be an aquired taste...either you have grow to love it or pass it up.  For me, we will opt to pass. The "taste" isn't bad and maybe it would have been better if it had been a little saucy. If you make it as is, its a little dry to serve over spagehtti noodles. My boyfriend, who thought the taste was good, said the texture was like sloppy joes over spaghetti. Perhaps another can of tomato sauce or the addition of a can of diced tomatoes? Oh well, it was worth a try!

This is my favorite Chili recipe! Everyone loved it! I only put in 1 pound of beef and added another can of tomatoe sauce. It is spicy so if you serve it to kids you might want to cut the chili powder in half. The taste is still great even with less chili powder! I've already made it several times!

This recipe was delicious, and I will be using it again.  Not living near any "Skyline Chili" restaurants (it is available frozen in some supermarkets near me, however), yet very fond of their chili, I was very glad to stumble on this authentic-tasting recipe.  I didn't get the consistency right on this first making, and, should this happen again, might proportionally increase the tomato sauce and spices or cut the amount of meat in subsequent preparations.  The thicker consistency I got would be perfect for a "Skyline coney dog", I think.  Thank you, Rennie!

This recipe was great.  Tastes just like Skyline.  I did take the advice of some of the other users and I cooked the ground beef in water and broke it up really fine with a whisk.  I left the water in and then added the other ingredients and doubled the amount of tomato sauce so it was runnier.  Yummy!  I also added a little more cinnamon.

This recipe was really easy and REALLY delicious! The flavors mixed perfectly and (thank GOD) it wasn't too cumin-y. I hate chili with too much cumin! 
I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a 15oz can of diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato sauce. Gave it a little extra juice without making it too saucy. I also used soy ground instead of ground beef (make sure to add 1-2TBSP vegetable oil when browning with onion since soy ground doesn't have any "natural" oil). Sooo good. Will make again and again!

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I did add a 28 OZ. can of tomato sauce to the chili rather than 2 8 oz. cans. I like my chili saucier. I also broke the spaghetti into smaller pieces, boiled it, then mixed it right into the chili along with the beans. I had company over this weekend and they devoured it! The "corn dog muffin" recipe on here goes really well with this. I will make this again! Thanx!

I'm in agreement with other reviewers--way too thick, nothing like the real Skyline Chili.  The flavor was good, but still not like the original.  I'll keep looking for their dry mix--they had it in grocery stores at one time...

Good! I followed one reviewers suggestions and didn't brown the meat. It was fine and eliminated a step.  I think it was a tad bit dry.  Not sure quite how to fix it.  Its been a few years since I have had the real thing so not sure how to compare, but I will say that it is good enough to have again!

Very easy and delicious. This will be a repeat selection at my house. I cut the ground beef to one pound, and between me and my husband (and the dog) there were no leftovers!

I tried this recipe as written and like many others I thought it needed more sauce. Family liked the flavor (I only used about half the chili powder) and said they would eat it again if I fixed it. Thank you.

This recipe was okay.  I added a cup of water, as others commented that the chili was a little too thick.  I also chopped the browned ground beef/onion in a food processor.  Additionally, I used a little less chili powder and added a couple shots of cayenne pepper sauce and a pinch of unsweetened cocoa powder.  My husband thought that this was good, but commented that the flavors didn't meld together quite as well as Skyline.  He said that it was "Cincinnati-style" but definitely no Skyline.

First, let me say I think I have discovered the secret ingrediant!  While it may not be perfect, I think I got pretty dang close... This was a good recipe for a start... but being very familiar with the way Skyline tastes and the texture- they don't have this right.  I added about a cup and a half of water and I used a hand blender (on the finished product) to get it to the right consistency.  This recipe must have forgotten to add any water, because it is waaaaay too thick.  I would decrease the chili powder to about half.  I added 2 pinches of cinnamon and 2 pinches of cocoa powder (per other's recommendations).  I also added about a teaspoon and a 1/2 of what I think is the secret- curry powder.  I didn't use onions or beans because I like my skyline as a "3-way" (spaghetti, chili, and cheese).

Very good  but not quite skyline.  This is only the second recipe I've tried and it's far better than the first one I made.  It's missing something, but it's just as good as a mix/envelope.  I didn't brown the beef and added a bit of water.  I also added a little cocoa and extra vinegar which I thought made it a little closer but still no cigar.
