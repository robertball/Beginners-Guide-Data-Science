While very good, I think the butter could be reduced to 1/4-1/3 cup-I had the same experience as another reviewer who commented that butter had actually seeped through the paper liners and was visible in the pan after the muffins were removed.  Good banana flavor, hearty texture because of the oats and nuts, and a crunchy brown sugar topping. Muffin tin sizes vary, so you may get more or less than 12 muffins--just remember to fill the muffin cups 3/4 full.

It really bugs me it when people review recipes after making a ton of changes but because a lot of swaps are suggested in reviews for this particular muffin, I will say this: these were good the way I made them after reading through the reviews but I suspect they would have been better had I not swapped half the butter for applesauce, exchanged for wheat flour and  subbed low-fat yogurt for the sour cream.  A solid three or four with the subs, I have no trouble believing they'd be 5 star if left alone.

These are irresistible! I made two batches, one as muffins and one in a brownie pan, and I thought the brownie pan batch turned out better - much moister. Perhaps I would reduce the cooking time for the muffins a bit next time. I also used whole oats rather than grinding them, as I don't own a food processor, and it was terrific - gave it great hearty texture. The crumbles on top are amazing, everyone loved them! These were an overwhelming hit. Highly recommend--thanks for a great recipe!

I make a lot of muffins and these are probably my favorite.  They are very moist, and my favorite part is the wonderful texture!  With a few changes, they're healthy too!  I substituted white whole wheat flour (you could also use ww pastry flour or plain whole wheat) for all the all purpose - subbed extra banana for 1/2 the butter, and nonfat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  The nuts are definitely optional, as is the topping.  They are also plenty sweet with only 3/4 cup of sugar. Also, remember the baking soda - it's not in the directions! My kids gobble these up!  Thanks!

This is absolutely the best muffin recipe I've ever come across.  The flavor is outstanding, and I've never even used the crumble topping.  This last time I made them I actually substituted half the butter with coconut oil, and what was great became out of this world!  Since I use really ripe bananas, I usually cut back a little on the sugar.  I use 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown.  The only other subsitution I make is with the use of pecans rather than walnuts.  I have already shared this recipe with many and will continue to do so!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made these using sweetener rather than sugar and low fat yoghurt instead of sour cream to make them healthier. I liked the idea and taste of the ground oats, makes them more dense. As I don't have any muffin cases I made these in smaller bun cases and only cooked them for 20 minutes. I didn't top them just sprinkled them with brown sugar (again for health reasons). Absolutely delicous and tasted very much like professional muffins. I lovely change to banana bread. The recipe made 26 muffin buns.

these are soooo good! i didn't have any nuts, so i added some dried cranberries.  i accidently added a half tsp of cinnamon, but it wasn't a problem. might add a touch more next time. i was a tad disappointed that they didn't get a big muffin top on them, but i'm over it! LOL  Really really tasty muffins. thanks for sharing AAMMEGAN!

Ummmm! These were great! and my co workers agree. I made a couple changes to the recipe, I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. I also substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c butter that the recipe called for. I didnâ€™t have any sour cream, so I just left that out. But my end result was still great, and the topping is wonderful!! Thank you so much for this recipe!

wow... these are GREAT muffins.  so yummy.  great even without the topping, so i will cut out (or maybe just use a sprinkle of brown sugar) next time.  also... i like a more textured muffin, so i didn't grind the oats, i used them as is.  delicious.  thanks for the great recipe!!

These were really good. This has replaced all other banana muffin receipes including other ones found on this website. Since I like the texture of oats I didn't grind them up. I also replaced 1/2 of the butter with applesauce and used all whole wheat flour. I didn't do the crumb topping but just sprinkled with some decorating sugar and cinnamon. These are really fantastic.

As written 3 stars.  I didn't care for the topping.  It actually sunk.  With moderations, 5 stars.  Substitute 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup canola oil.  Increase bananas by 1/2 cup.  Add 1 tablespoon molasses (incredible). Substitute 1/2 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Substitute 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat stone ground flour (next time I'll substitute completely with wheat flour)  Omit topping.  I baked this in a loaf pan for almost an hour (checking at 45 minutes.)  I do have to thank AAMMEGAN for the base of this recipe, though.  I'd like to also try substituting the banana for pumpkin.

These. Were. Amazing! I didn't make any changes- I usually don't the first time I make a recipe. Made them for the family during a members hospitalization, and I know my husband would have eaten them all if i didn't make him share!

These were AMAZING! I could not get enough of the banana flavour. The oatmeal also added an inviting texture. I used low fat vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream, since that was what I had on hand. It worked great! I also used 1 tbs. of baking powder b/c I had no baking soda. Unfortunately, I did not have any walnuts either, but the muffins still turned out great. Full of flavour--thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

Without question, 5 stars!  Moist, lots of flavour and the kids love them.  I doubled the batch and since I always use large flake outs, I ground 1 cup and poured 1 cup in whole for texture.  As another review said, try cutting back on the butter a little. Instead of 1 cup (I doubled the recipe), I used just a little bit over 3/4.  3/4 cup probably would have been perfect.  Half the batch got lots and lots of dates and the other half got 85% Lindt dark chocolate pieces I broke from a bar.  If you can't get the family out of bed in the morning, try making these.  Not sure what is better, the taste or the smell in the house now.  :)   Thank you so much for sharing.   These are perfect the way they are.

This recipe was not only very good, but also very easy. I simplified the recipe even more by using Quick cooking oats instead processing the whole oats. Also instead of cutting in the butter, I shredded the cold butter in the topping mixtre using a cheese shredder. I give this recipe 5 stars. I'ts also a wonderful recipe to cook with kids. Thanks.

Excellent!!  I like to include whole wheat flour in baked goods to increase the fiber, so I used 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat; omitted the nuts; cut the sugar to 1/2 cup BUT added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips; left off the topping (wasn't in the mood for topping).  Kids and husband loved them.

These are super good. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, used almond extract instead of vanilla (ran out of vanilla) and added 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. LOVE these! They taste much better after sitting out for a while. I tried one right out of the oven, and it was just good. 5 hours later they are outstanding. I also added 1/2 tsp of baking soda!

This recipe is fantastic!  These muffins are more like a banana bread texture which is fine by me.  I used quick cooking oats rather than processing regular oats, and they just kind of melted into the muffin.  Also, I didn't have sour cream, so I used yogurt instead, and that worked out fine.  The only thing I would like to have different would be that they rise more, but I'll sacrifice looks for taste!  My four year old gobbled his up!

These were wonderful.  I used fat free sour cream (that is all I had) and cooked them in texas muffin tins, adding 5 minutes to the cooking time.  They were just wonderful.  Best breakfast treat ever!!

Delicious! I only changed a couple of things to make them lower in fat, and you would not even know it. I used lite sour cream, substituted 1/4 cup of butter with 1/4 cup applesauce and only used the walnuts in the topping. Thank you for the great recipe!

I LOVE these muffins. I have made as muffins and as bread (both are amazing!). I know that everyone has said they made changes, I didn't the first time, but the second I used applesauce in place of butter in the batter and cut the walnuts (just to make them healthier)... still outstanding!

These were WAY TOO buttery. I read other reviews but didn't think they could possibly be so greasy. Well, they are. They either needed more flour or less butter. They tasted really yummy, but they fell flat in the middle I think from too much butter. Kind of a waste of ingredients. I'm going to eat them still though because I hate to throw food away. I will make these again, but cut butter down or just add more flour.

These are AMAZING!!  I decided to lightly sprinkle the topping on top and I'm glad I did - didn't want it too sweet.  These are moist and have a great texture!  My new go to muffin recipe!  Thank you!

These were so good!  I used Greek style yogurt instead of the sour cream, and brown sugar in place of the white, both because it was what I had on hand.  I used my mini muffin tins and the first batch ran together.  A little disappointing, but in the end, that just meant more muffin top!  I added another 1/2 cup flour to the double batch and the next round came out just fine.

-substitute greek yogurt for the sour cream (tastes EXACTLY the same without the unnecessary fat).
-I prefer the texture only grinding about 1/2 of the oatmeal (personal preference)
-I'd skip the topping (although who doesn't love brown sugar and butter) I think it makes it too sweet.

This recipe is a keeper!  Changes I made were to use 3 T rolled oats in the batter vs. 1 as I had no nuts, and I upped the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. I probably had more than 1 c bananas; I used what I had which was 3.5 med very ripe ones. This made 18 muffins for me, so next time I will make 1.5 times the topping to generously cover. Also I will be careful to fill tins only 1/2 full, as the overfilled ones tended to stick more. This recipe takes a banana muffin up a notch to a banana streusel muffin.  Mine were not chewy but very soft, and held together well. Loved the topping even without the nuts.

These are easy and yummy! I used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream and left out the walnuts as my kids are nut free at school. Great!

OMG these muffins are amazing!!! Everyone LOVES them.  Make sure you do not overfill the muffin tins.  I filled them a little over 2/3 full the first time because there was so much batter and they rose over...I had to put a cookie sheet under them to catch the drippings.  However, they still turned out amazing.  I also have made them with vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream in a pinch and they were still amazing!

I think this is a good recipe.  But I liked it better with half the sugar, low fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and a little more cinnamon.  But otherwise really good even if you dont make changes

These were fantastic, but I made some changes.  I used Blue Bonnet Light vegetable spread instead of butter, used 1 1/4 cups bananas (because that's what I got from the three bananas I had), and used 1/3 cup all natural sour cream (because that's what I had left in the container).  I also left out the walnuts (don't care for nuts in breads) and the topping.  Since 1/4 tsp cinnamon didn't seem like it would be much flavor, I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg.  The way I made them, these are the best banana muffins I've ever tasted!  It ended up making 16 muffins instead of 12 because I couldn't fit it all into 12 muffin cups.  My version also has far fewer calories at about 130 per muffin (according to Livestrong.com's recipe builder).

Very good, moist, topping was perfect! I didn't process the oats, used plain yogurt because that is what I had on hand, used almond and banana flavorings, used pecans and chocolate chips, used only 3/4 cup sugar, added wheat germ and flax seed. Will make again with out the flax seed as it caused some problems with my daughter. I love it however and so does my husband.

These are amazing. Just the right amount of banana flavor. I did not make the topping nor did I process the oats but they turned out great- a bit heartier for breakfast with the whole oats in them and a bit healthier without the topping. I bet the topping is great tho!

Wow, these are simply delicious.  Just took them out of the oven about 45 min ago.   So moist and tasty.  The only thing I did was leave out the nuts.  Mine came out with huge caps on them, yummo!!  Cooked them for exactly 25 min., no need to change anything as they are perfect as written.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this muffin gluten free by substituting half soy and half Quinoa flour for the regular flour.  Also used half olive oil/half butter.  I substituted Sugar Twin for the sugar....but only used about 1/2 cup.  With all those health substitutions, they were amazingly good!

I can't believe I've failed to rate this recipe before now - I've made these muffins dozens of times and I don't even really like bananas!  Even my extremely picky 2 year-old likes these!

Adaptations I've made over time - substitute pecans for walnuts (personal preference), omit the cinnamon, add 2 tblsp lemon juice, and 2 tblsp meyer's rum (it isn't a strong/recognizable taste but really adds something).  I also tend to add a bit more banana than recommended because that makes the bananas more moist.  I also don't add the topping, I don't think the muffins need it.  As another reviewer advised, don't forget the baking soda because the recipe doesn't actually call for it.

Amazing - worth trying at least once!

Yummylicious!  I didn't grind the oats as I like the added texture of leaving them whole.  Also didn't add nuts, but I imagine these will be "over the top" when I add them next time. I'll also probably add more cinnamon.  Great recipe!

these taste really good, but the topping made them too sweet. also, the weight of the topping made the middle of my muffins sink in. maybe if i do these again, i will reduce the amount i put on & put less sugar in the muffin itself.

Perfect Banana Muffins - just as it is.  I left out the nuts because not everyone in my family is a fan it was still a wonderful tasting recipe.  Very moist.  I made no changes to the recipe and I made some as regular sized muffins and some as minimuffins.  The minis only took 13 minutes to bake in my oven.

These have a nice texture and flavor.  They are moist and do not fall apart. The oats add a slight crunch. The bananas make these sweet without being overbearing, and the sour cream adds a little tartness.  I substituted applesauce for the butter in the muffin, and nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream, and they were still delicious.  I will definitely make these again!

I really loved this recipe.  Instead of sour cream, I used low fat plain yogurt... I also nixed the topping to cut down on calories, but they were still delicious!  My family loves them!

I have been trying to find a recipe for banana muffins for years that my husband would eat.  He LOVES these and he was fighting our kids for them!!!!  These are so good with the oat/brown sugar topping and the cinnamon.  The interior of the muffins are moist and extra yummy too!  Now I am just waiting for more bananas to get over ripe... :)

These were fabulous!  I made them for my sister for when she had her first baby, and she gobbled them up all night after the birth.  They taste very similar to muffins from Tim Hortons, but are much better for you.

This is such a great recipe.  I used 3/4 cup all-purpose and 1/4 wheat.  I don't like to bite into a nut so I ground my nuts very fine for the muffin and for the topping.  They turned out great and very moist.  This is a keeper.

These were almost too moist!  The butter soaked thru the muffin papers & made them greasy.  Also, they didn't rise to my liking.  The tops were flat, and I like a big domed top.  The flavor was good though.

These muffins are excellent.  I will use the muffin liners next time because it was hard to keep them from coming apart when taking them out of the pan.  They still tasted great!

Well these have the potential to be amazing. I made these with a 4 year old and so I just wanted to get them done quick.  In the ingredients it called for baking soda and powder.  But in the instructions it only asked for baking powder. It didn't occur to me till I had already put the batter in the muffin tins and my daughter was putting the oat topping on.  So disappointing to have flat muffins.

Super delicious way to use up the old bananas.  I agree with many other reviewers; they were too sweet as written.  Next time I will use 3/4 c. sugar or less in the batter.  These filled 12 standard muffin cups to the top, so they rose to make a beautiful muffin top.

Delicious but THIS SHOULD BE THE "HALF THE BUTTER/SUGAR AND TOPPING RECIPE!" VERSION OF BANANA MUFFINS!


TOPPING:  I did read the review about cutting the topping in half so they don't sink -- and that worked.


BUTTER: Did not read about cutting butter in half so used the whole stick that the recipe called for and they are greasy and leaking through muffin paper cups.  


SUGAR: I don't like overly sugary things (just a personal preference,, no weight issues nor am I a healthnut) so I just automatically cut the white sugar in half and they are still plenty sugary esp. with the topping!


Overall a very nice recipe, great flavor and texture.  Next time I will just CUT the 3 ingredients in HALF and I am sure they will then be 5 STAR!!

These muffins are crazy good! I took a chance and went ahead and made a double batch and I'm really glad I did. I did make a few small changes. I only ground half of the oats and the rest were straight old fashioned oats. I used half butter, half coconut oil. And I cut the sugar in half. So yummy! Next time I'm going to cut the butter/coconut oil down and sub in some applesauce and cut the sugar down even further. The bananas make them quite sweet to begin with. Great for snacks and breakfast!

Love the texture of the half oat, half wheat flour! Very good. I used maybe half the crumble topping, cut back on the sugar and used greek yogurt in place of sour cream. Made 2 weeks in a row!

This recipe is one of the best. I have made it following the recipe almost exactly, except for leaving out the sour cream, as I simply don't keep it in the house, and I have made it with many modifications. I personally agree with other reviewers that have said that there is too much butter. I have in my subsequent uses of this recipe cut the butter down to 1/4 cup. It could be my bananas or my area simply has too much moisture for that much butter. I also have made this recipe with half whole wheat flour, and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. This is due to personal preference. I also don't measure out my banana quantity so I probably use too much. I also don't add butter to the topping. Once again, this recipe is great as is, but I have also enjoyed tinkering with it to make it more to my tastes.

These muffins are awesome!  I made a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I left the oats whole since I don't have a food processor and the texture came out really well.  Since I didn't have any sour cream I debated between yogurt or mayonnaise, and opted for the mayo.  I had some apples that needed to be used or tossed so I chopped those up and threw them in, so glad I did!  I also doubled the topping since I was able to make 18 muffins from this recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Next time I want to add raisins, increase the cinnamon a bit, and add a pinch of salt to the topping.

These are awesome!!! I am not a banana lover, and these are great! They are very moist and soft.  I used 1 (6oz.) cup of Yoplait French Vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream. I made the mistake of filling the cups too full. My muffins were more muffin tops than muffins. That's ok...the tops are the best part!! These are a new favorite.

this was a good recipe to use as a guideline for a healthier muffin. Using whole wheat for part of flour, egg substitute, greek yogurt, half sugar, apple sauce for all but 1TB oil, punch up the spices a bit, and no butter in the topping,  I used spray butter. Still sticks to the papers but really good muffins!

Great recipe ... Muffins very moist. 
I doubled the recipe & substituted chocolate chips for walnuts.   FOR DOUBLE the recipe, I used 1.5 cups sugar total (1/2 white + 1 cup brown),  and used 2/3 cup butter total.   All else the same ... YUMMMY !!   
Thanks !

These have a great flavor, but the butter seemed a little fussy for a muffin recipe. Next time I'm  using melted butter and leaving the hand mixer in the cabinet. (I used melted butter for the topping and it came out fine.) I'll also cut it down to one stick for the whole recipe since my muffin cups came out a little greasy.  

Also, don't forget the baking soda! It's in the ingredients list, but not in the directions.

These are absolutely amazing!  I only made two modifications because I had to otherwise I would have stuck with the exact recipe.  I was out of butter and all purpose flour so I used Extra Virgin Coconut oil and whole wheat flour.  Amazing!  I will make them again.

I would have to say this is probably the best banana muffin i have ever had. I found them to be very moist and they rose nicely. Love the topping. I did everything exactly as the recipe said and i wouldn't change a thing. My husband thoroughly enjoyed them, said he doesn't like it when the banana flavour is too over powering and he thought these were perfect. I will definitely print this recipe and add it to my recipe binder and will make them again.

I loved these. Not too sweet, not too fluffy-great chew, very moist. I made them in the xtra large silicon muffin pan and had enough batter left over to fill an xtra small (1 bite) muffin pan. The big ones are perect size--and they kept well for days! I didn't do the topping but will try that next time...they really don't NEED it. Thanks for this recipe--it's a keeper.

This is the best banana muffin I've ever had.  The only "change" that I made was excluding the nuts due to allergies.  I can image how great they would have been with them.

I made this recipe exactly the same except I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  These muffins are really terrific and my husband really enjoyed them.  I will definitely make them again.

These are fantastic.  I made them just as the recipe suggested EXCEPT I had to substitute some of the butter with no cholesterol spread.  I did use the 2 tbs of butter in the topper. 

This recipe makes 24 muffins with regular muffin tins.

This is a great recipe.  As others suggested, I cut the butter to 1/4 cup.  I did not put the additional topping on and I think they were just as good.  I found them a little sweet so will adjust the sugar next time as well.  Definitely a keeper.

Great Recipe!
Made a few changes of course. Used grapeseed oil instead of butter, changed 1/2 of flour to whole wheat. Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.
The muffins were light in color. served with cheese.

Absolutely delicious!  I've tried numerous banana muffin recipes, all of which are very similar.  This is the first recipe that calls for sour cream that I have tried, and I beleive that is what makes these muffins soooooo good and so moist.  And you needn't bother to grind the oats.  I used them whole and it was great.  Also I cut down on the butter by half as suggested and they still had a yummy buttery flavor.

This is a really excellent banana muffin recipe!!  The muffins turned out much lighter than I would have expected and had a "heartier" taste than many banana muffins.  The only change I made was to use half white and half dark brown sugar (just because I like the taste of brown sugar).  I will definitely make these again as my husband loved them.

I love these muffins! I'm so happy I found this recipe because they are just perfect.They turned out very tender and moist and I love that they have oatmeal in them.I didn't make the topping I just sprinkled a little brown sugar on top.I used wheat flour in place of half the white flour and I couldn't even tell.I also used part oil and part applesauce instead of butter and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.I left the nuts out just because we don't care for them in our breads.Even with the changes they turned out incredibly moist and had a wonderful flavor.I sent one in my husbands lunch and he even called to tell me how good it was.I'm making more of these today they really are delicious!

I used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, subbed half homemade organic applesauce for half of the butter, used 1/4 cup of sugar and fat free sour cream. I did not make the topping in order to cut back on the sugar/fat. These turned out nicely and they smell SO good.

I left out the nuts (for my husband the nut hater) and added 1/2 cup ground flax seed. I did not put on the topping to save calories and left the oats whole. Turned out very good, moist and yummy!!

These are great!  Light and fluffy, not dense like most banana breads.  The streusel is pretty too.

Awesome recipe.  I've made it countless times and has always been a hit.  I make 2 batches and freeze them.  Every morning and take one out and microwave it for 40 seconds, tastes as if I just baked them.  I added ground flaxseed to give it more fiber content.  At times, I substitute flour for whole wheat flour, then add 1 tbs of vegetable oil so it doesn't come out too dry.  They're AMAZING.

This is my new favorite banana bread recipe. I made one loaf of bread and put the remaining batter into a muffin pan with chocolate chips. Everyone agreed that this is the best banana bread we've ever made. One problem is that the middle did sink in, though it was cooked all the way through. Maybe I'll cook it a little longer next time.

I made these muffins with some alterations. I didn't grind the oats because I do not have a food processor. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. I switched the nuts for chocolate chips. Also substituted the sour cream for non-fat yogurt. My muffins didn't rise but they taste great. I would cook them for longer and put even less sugar if I made them again.

I made a few small changes and left out the topping, and they were great! I used half whole wheat flour, 1/2 C white sugar and 1/4 C brown sugar, toasted walnuts, 1/3 C butter, and about 1 1/2 C bananas. The recipe made 18 muffins for me. They are really good, and reasonably healthy!

I doubled this recipe for my Bible Study group.  WOW!!  These are wonderful.  The only alteration I made was substituting yogurt for the sour cream (it was what I had on hand).  I anticipate many demands for the recipe.  Kids love them also!

These muffins are great!  I also replaced the butter with apple sauce, used whole wheat flour, cut the sugar down to a little over a 1/2 cup, and added wheat germ and flax seed.  Next time I think I will use yogurt instead of the sour cream. So good, and healthy too!

These muffins were really yummy and pretty easy to make. I followed other peoples' suggestion and also used applesauce instead of butter. I was running low on vanilla so I increased the cinnamon in the recipe. These muffins came out so incredibly moist and flavorful and were a big hit with the familly.

This recipe is great for too soft bananas and peaches that would otherwise get tossed. I know - strange combo, but what I had on hand that day. Muffins came out very dense, but not watery at all and my husband has been eating them for breakfast, lunch and dinner since I made them two nights ago.
If I have any criticism, it is that they are too addictive!
Great recipe says hubby, so they are a keeper. 
Thanks, Kimberly!

This recipe is great!!  The only thing I changed was instead of using 1 cup of all purpose flour I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 1/2 cup of almond flour.  (Almond flour is simply almonds pulverized in your prossessor.)  The topping adds a nice crown to the muffin and as the recipe calls, be generous with the topping.  I did note from another review that the butter in the topping caused the paper  cups to be greasy so when I took them out of the oven I immediately set them on paper towels to absorb the butter.  My husband and mother-in-law just loved these.  Thanks, Kimberly, for a keeper.

I have been trying many banana muffin recipes over the last few years trying to find one that I really like. This is, hands down, the best recipe I have come across. I love them! YUM! YUM! YUM! Thanks Kimberly!

Instead of topping, I added chocolate chips. Moist yet firm on outside.

I have made these several times and I never grind the oats like it says and I cut the sugar in half and add chocolate chips. 
I also tend to use a mix of whole wheat and almond flower and I put blueberries instead of walnuts in them. In short I don't follow the recipe  but I do make them often and my family enjoys this version (I also use full fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream).          :P

Best banana nut muffins! I didnâ€™t have sour cream, so just left that out. I did half brown, half white sugar. I used quick outs and didnâ€™t process them. I used a different crumb topping left over from another recipe. I didnâ€™t measure the bananas, and might have added more than called for (used 3.5). Keeping this recipe.

I am trying various oatmeal muffin recipes and this one is the best so far.  I did make it slightly healthier by using lite sour cream, egg whites and reduced butter to 1/3 cup.    Next time I make these I will try replacing 1/2 butter with applesauce.  These are delicious as is.

This recipe is more complicated than it's mash, mix and bake relatives, but the payoff in texture and flavor is well worth the effort! 
I used three bananas, substituted brown for the white sugar, and left out the salt and nuts. Combined with zero sodium baking soda and powder, these tasted amazing with only 18 mg salt each!

Great muffins.  I didn't have to substitute anything.  I also included the topping which adds extra crunch and texture. I will definitely make them again.

It was good. I used less butter and added coconut. Very soft and moist. The second time I added two cups flour, no oats or nuts but did add shredded coconut, apple and raisins with less sugar. The  muffins were moist and delicious.

The directions omitted baking soda, other than that I followed the directions. I used large muffin tins, and ended up with 8 muffins instead of 12. Love this, will make this again.

Worst recipe ever.  Too much leavening caused the muffins to rise and overflow the tins, then sank in the middle.  Could not remove them from the pan without crumbling.

Am I crazy or is baking soda not needed in this?  Its listed in the ingredients but never mentioned in the instructions.  Perhaps a typo?  

In any case, I LOVED these as did my picky daughter.  I think the trick was chopping up those walnuts so they didn't take over the bites!  

I used Smart Balance Buttery Spread instead of butter which make it a bit more difficult to make the crumbly topping.  Perhaps I should have gotten the spread harder by freezing it a bit.  I also use the SBBS for the other times the recipe called for butter.  They were still delicious!

I used a manual chopper as I don't own a food processor and burned some calories in the process of grinding the oats.

Well, like a lot of bakers, I did make substitutions.  Whole wheat flour instead of white and crushed almonds because had no walnuts.  Put in some ground flaxseed. Totally yummy and satisfying and didn't even have the topping.  That would have been delicious and I would have had a harder time stopping at three....yes, three.  I got 18 small to medium muffins.  Love the ground oatmeal, it gives a heartiness to these muffins.  Thank you!

Very, very delicious! So addicting... did not stick to the paper liners like some other recipes did. Like others, I would recommend using a little less butter in the muffin batter. I would say about 1/4-1/3 would be a little better. Also, the topping was also a little buttery, so you could leave that out id desired. But overall, very good!

These are wonderful. Perfect cross between a banana cupcake and banana bread. I did only ONE thing differently because other reviewers said that the butter oozed out from the paper liners. I reduced the amount of butter from 8 Tablespoons (1/2 Cup) to 6 Tablespoons. I used remaining 2 tablespoons of the stick in the crumb topping as directed.

Didn't make the topping, but made the muffins following the recipe. Usually I make a few tweaks, this time the changes were very minimal - no walnuts for me, and instead of grinding oats, I used instant plain oatmeal. Amazingly this recipe even incorporates the cinnamon and vanilla I usually add on my own. Topping was not required at all. These are amazing!!! So moist (the sour cream does its job well here) and a lovely texture. Lots of flavour.  This is my new go-to muffin recipe!!!

Wow! These were the most moist muffins I've ever made! I opted to leave the oats whole and add mini chocolate chips. I also omitted the crumb topping. To make them fancy, I baked them in a 6- mini bundt cake pan. My husband requested that I make them again some time and my 2 year-old gobbled hers up!

I made it with half the butter, the other half extra yogurt- full fat as we have plenty of that.   I used yogurt not sour cream in this. I used 1.5 extra ripe bananas. I used oats without grinding them & used reduced sugar, 1/2 cup.,and no nuts as we have a baby that isn't eating nuts yet. I diced an apple &  added that. I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg & generously dusted the top with nutmeg. I skipped the topping. Also for the mixing, I skipped the two bowl thing & mixed it in one bowl. The butter happened to be melted, not softened. I made it in one pan instead of muffins, a 8x8. It took longer to bake, more like 45 min & the last 15 min were at 375 degrees. This turned out great! It smelled so good & was tasty, nicely spiced & not too sweet for us. That's our preference. We snacked on it this evening & will enjoy in the morning!

First I used bakers spray to grease the muffin tins. I didnt add cinnamon but I did add dark chocolate chips and I felt the batter was a bit runny, so I added a fistful of flour extra which helped. They tasted very nice, not too sweet. Actually with the addition of choccy chips I think the sugar content in the batter could be reduced a little and next time I make them I think I will add a few more unground oats. The only other change I made was I didnt do the crunchy topping..................BIG hit with the family, will definitely try them again...   :o)

These were great. I made a few alterations. I threw in a handful extra of oats. Added 1/2 cup of applesauce for moisture. Added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and skipped the crumb topping. Served warm with a scoop of peanut butter YUM

I made  these todays after looking for a new spin on banana nut muffins.  I followed other reviewers recommendations about cutting the sugar and wished I hadn't as I found these not quite sweet enough.  I also didn't really care for the cinnamon and won't use that again.  Otherwise, they had a very interesting texture due to the oats which at first is odd but is strangely addictive.  I like them and hope my hubby will as well.  They don't rise the same as other muffins but otherwise, are pretty good.  I'll make again.

Awesome!! While it took me a little longer to prep and ten minutes longer to bake (in an electric stove), this is an amazingly moist recipe.

yummy! Really moist! subbed applesauce for butter; used 1 cup quick oats; 1/2 c ww flour n 1/2 c white; 1/2 t cinn; 1/2 nutmeg; 1/4 salt; 1/3 white sugar n 1/3 brown; 1/2 cup lowfat banilla yogurt; and TONS of pecans! 30 minutes for 13 rectangle muffins. (next time - maybe 1 t cinn, and 1/4 each sugar if using that yogurt... it's already got lots of sugar.)

This was an excellent recipe, and a wonderful "new way" for me to use up bananas that had gotten too ripe!  I was looking for something different, beyond the everyday "banana bread".  My husband said this is THE best muffin recipe I have ever made.  I used one of the suggestions offered and added a 1/2 cup of chopped, dried cranberries.  I also added about a 1/3 of a cup of chopped, dried cranberries to the topping, and I think this addition really adds a lot to the recipe.  It also makes it kind of "seasonal" for Fall, November and Thanksgiving!  I did not have walnuts, so I used pecans instead and it turned out great!!  I made a double batch and used 6 large bananas, so I probably ended up doubling the amount of banana that it calls for.

These muffins are very good! I made changes also; I used buttermilk instead of sour cream and I also substituted the White flour with whole wheat flour. Everyone was right about the butter; it was seeping through the muffins liners when I was taking out the muffin pans. Next time I will use 1/4 cup of butter.

Really good recipe. I have made a lot of banana bread in my life. I liked the oats as they give the muffins a nice texture. I didn't make the topping to save calories and they are still really good. I did top with a little Turbinado sugar which gave a nice crunch. I forgot the sour cream which I was mad at myself for because I love the flavor that it gives to baked good. Still good. This is definitely a keeper.  I will update this to say that I added a little sour cream to the remaining batter and it made a huge difference in how they rose in the oven. So, don't forget the sour cream like I did.

I recently tried this recipe. I increased the amount of cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts. They tasted good. I will say, I think you could go with at least half the butter that is called for in the recipe. The paper liners were drenched in butter. I don't think any butter is necessary in the topping.

these muffins were amazing but sadly I found not give them a 5 star rating because I had to alter the ingredients so much first I added only half cup sugar and two bananas I added one tsp of cinnamon and one tsp salt and for the topping I added the oats two tbs of butter one or two tsp of white sugar one tsp cinnamon and left out the nuts I was a little disappointed with the topping because it did not cover all of them only covered eight and that was really stretching it which was really a shame because the topping was fabulous I baked for twenty five minutes and they were perfect I drizzled warm honey over the top for a little more sweet.

Delicious!!  A very hearty and delicious version of regular banana muffins.  The only change I made was I used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream because I did not have sour cream.  They were awesome anyways - next time I will try them with sour cream and see which is better.  Made 6 large muffins for me, good recipe!

I made these according to the original recipe, and they were quite good - nice and moist with a delicate crumb, and a great way to use up that warehouse-sized box of oats and those brown bananas taking up space on my countertop.  My biggest problem with them was that there was too much topping, and it made the muffins too sweet, and too hard to get out of the tin.  Next time, I'll substitute whole wheat flour for half of the white flour, and cut the amount of topping in half.  And, I can't say emphatically enough USE PAPER LINERS.  No matter how carefully you prepare the pan THESE WILL NOT COME OUT OF THE PAN GRACEFULLY.  THEY WILL STICK.

Not a change made to the recipe, and we loved it. Muffins are sort of my "thing" and I'm usually reluctant to try a new recipe, but I will absolutely add these to my weekly muffin rotation.

I was craving some chocolate so I added some chocolate chips to the recipe.  Other than I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a huge hit with my family.  I was told that I definitely need to make these again.

Wonderful muffins!  I made this pretty much as reads, except - like others - I cut the butter to 6 tbsp (instead of 8)and sugar to 3/4 cup.  I didn't have any walnuts so I used chopped pecan pralines instead.  They turned out moist, light and delicious.

Very yummy! I used pecans rather than walnuts, and it turned out great! Next time I am going to try 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar sugar rather than all white sugar.

Oh my WORD, these are amazing.  Moist, depth of flavor and textures- just perfect.  I have never really liked banana anything, but made these because I had brown bananas.  Maybe I'LL let my banana's go brown more often now!

love them! I took advice from others and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and did not use the topping.  I didn't have sour cream and I poured in a little apple juice for moisture.  They are amazing!

Definitely a keeper!  I made substitutions based on my dietary preferences and what I like to bake with, but I'm sure it's fabulous as written too.  I reduced walnuts to 1/4 c in muffins and 2 tbsp. in topping.  I exchanged 1/2 c coconut oil in place of butter and reduced sugar to 1/2 c sugar + 1/4 c honey.  I used 2 ripe, mashed bananas (not sure the equivalent measurements, but they were good sized bananas) and eliminated the sour cream altogether.  They were perfect baked for 25 min...12 oversized muffins with crumbly goodness on top!

Delicious! And we're not banana lovers. I didn't have sour cream, so used vanilla yogurt instead. Can't go wrong there, but maybe slightly sweeter. The tops were not as beautiful and full as the best muffins I've seen, but the flavor made up for it.

My hubby just had a heart attack so am trying to use heart friendly alternatives.  I left out the walnuts and then I used olive oil instead of butter for both the batter and the streusel topping and replaced the sour cream with applesauce.  It turned out fabulous!!!

Amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only put walnuts on the top so my non nut-loving kids could pick them off.  The batter spread out a little on top creating wide muffin tops.  I probably could have gotten 14 muffins out of it instead of 12.  The taste was terrific!   Hearty enough for breakfast, sweet enough for dessert.

These weren't bad, but they weren't my favorite banana muffins.  I give it 4 stars because I think this recipe has serious potential if you leave off the topping.  I did my best to stick to the ingredients listed.  The only changes I made were using plain greek non fat yogurt instead of sour cream and I used old fashioned outs instead of rolled oats.  I also left out the walnuts because I don't care for them.  The results:  these muffins sunk, were far too sweet, and could use more banana flavor.  The muffins were also a little greasy, but I don't know if that's because of the topping or the butter used in the batter.  Next time I will skip the topping, add a little less sugar, and maybe add an extra banana.  I like strong banana flavor so that may be a personal preference.  Also, my old fashioned oats weren't very moist and were on the chewy side (and not in a good way) so I might par cook them, put them in the food processor for a second or just go out and buy some rolled oats.  Long story short, old fashioned oats just didn't cut it in this recipe.

I made these and fed them to my son and his 3 friends.  Three of the four loved them and the other wasn't thrilled.  I thought they were very tasty.  The only change I made was using pecans instead of walnuts, but that was because pecans were all I had.  I couldn't find where to add the baking soda, so I just added it in with the other dry ingredients in step #2.

I made these with whole wheat flour, added a ripe banana and a tsp. of cinnamon, then topped with a sprinkling of brown sugar and oats.(After following the directions exactly the first time. ) They're pretty good and substantial, but not very sweet.  The kids love them but it's not a WOW recipe for showing off.  This is now a breakfast staple at our house!  Thank you!

Wow!  I didn't have buttermilk, so did the typical milk/lemon juice substitution.  I made half the recipe in muffin tin and the other half in a loaf pan.  I froze the loaf - and when we ate it two weeks later it was even more moist and tasty!  I think I'll freeze the entire batch next time!

I love these muffins but I've doctored them and they're great! add almond extract, coconut, pecans, and chocolate chips either with or without the banana and its amazing! Also Sometimes I don't do the topping and its great. I never put the oats through the food processor, I like them whole! And I always use whole wheat flour!

These muffins were excellent! I only used 3/4 cup of sugar, but next time I will add only 1/2 cup. I also omitted the topping because the kids prefer without it.

I made a few small changes... didn't grind up the oatmeal, just dumped it right in... used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and 3/4 cup of honey instead of sugar... also added 1/2 cup of wheat germ... ended up with delicious, hearty-yet-sweet muffins that I will definitely make again!

These muffins have great flavor and texture.  I wished they rose a little higher, though.  I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and sugar to 1/2 cup, and they were still plenty moist and sweet with the crunchy topping.

HOW ARE THESE SOOOO GOOD? I've done many banana muffin recipes, none this amazing. Used fat free yogurt instead of sour cream, added an extra 1/2 cup of banana.Don't use the full amount of sugar, I substituted half with 1/2 cup brown sugar and about 3/4 cup white sugar & it was still a bit too much sugar. Yummyyyyyyyyy

Wow!!  These are really good!!  My family is going to love them. I am always looking for a good oatmeal recipe for my kids.  Now, I had planned on doing the recipe as is, but it seems as though I wasn't prepared to do any baking today!!  I didn't realize that I was out of so many things.  So I had to improvise.  I did double the recipe.    My brown sugar was hard, so I heated to loosen, (I think I got a cup out of it) with a 1/4 cup of white.  Used 1 cup each of white and whole wheat, with some wheat germ (1/2 cup) as well.  Used spiced rum instead of vanilla.    This one is the best...Had  only 1/4 of oats, (really thought I had more) so I strained all the sugars out of about 6 packets of instant oatmeal.  2 being multigrain ones.  I also used about 9 banana's (5 of which were smaller), as I love having lots of flavour.  I didn't add nuts--kids can't take them to school, but topped each one off with some chocolate chips, instead of using the crumb mixture.  These again were awesome...and BTW...Everything else I did have...lol

Absolutely delicious!! Even my husband who is very particular abut what goes int the cakes, cookies & muffins loved these muffins :) He only asked if it is pssible to substitute the sugar with Hney.. may try. My 3yr old didn't even take a bite but 6yr old has been having 2 at each sitting, he LOVES it. Between the 3 of us, the 15muffins I got from this recipe don't last more than 2 days. I didn't have sour cream so used plain yogurt instead (healthier anyway), also cut down on the butter(used only 1/3cup) & the w.sugar(3/4cup). Forgot to seperate the walnuts for the topping and mixed them all in with the flour. Only brown sugar and rolled oats for the topping yet it was still Excellent. YUMMY! Missing it already, will make more as soon as I buy some rolled oats!! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper :)

Really good muffins! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white.  I omitted the topping.  The result was a hearty muffin that had a great banana-nut flavor.

Delicious, even without the topping.  I'm trying to eat a bit healthier, so I omitted it and used a scant 2/3 c. of brown sugar instead of 1 c. white.  Also used yogurt instead of sour cream.  Cooked only 20 minutes. Results were  moist and yummy!

Delicious! I made these according to the recipe. My suggestion would be to bake these in two muffin pans so that you can separate one empty space between each muffin while baking because mine were touching eachother while baking. Great recipe!

these were really yummy, i substituted 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter, and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.

I also put in extra cinammon and some nutmeg and cloves.

I will definitely be making these again.  They were incredibly moist, next time i will put just applesauce and no oil.

these muffins are definitely moist, but they don't have a lot of flavor. If you like the banana flavor in a muffin, don't make these. If i try to make these again i would halve the salt and add more spices.

They were wonderful with great flavour.  I made some changes to make it more gluten and dairy free.
I used 1 cup rice flour and 2 tablespoons corn flour and only 1 egg.  I also used soured soy milk instead of the sour cream.  Still turned out wonderfully.

Fan. Tas. Tic! 
Ok ok, so I switched it up slightly by using 4 VERY ripe bananas, only 1/4 C butter, lite sour cream, and I subbed 1 tsp of Captain Morgan's rum for the vanilla. I baked them for 24 min--will bake maybe 1 or 2 more minutes longer next time. So very mouthwatering!

These muffins were very good, however they were a little bland.  Next time I will probably add more cinnimon and maybe some allspice or nutmeg.  I did take the advice of others and used applesauce instead of butter and replaced the sourcream with yogurt.  I will definitely make these again.

YUM!!!! These muffins rock!!!  I didn't do the topping (ran out of oats, oops!) and I used 1/4 C butter 1/4 C applesauce, reduced the sugar by 1/4 C.... and chopped the oats coarsely by hand (food processor is packed! moving!) and they were still fabulous.  These are dense, but still very soft, yummy muffins.  I did not find them to be crumbly at all as some other reviewers did.

My fav. healthy muffin so far. I was feeling experimental and added 1/4 tsp cloves and 3/4 tsp  cinammon, and reduced the shugar to 3/4 cup. 

I would have rather made 1.5 times the topping, I ran out and used coconut instead. I ended up with 18 regular muffins. I will definitely make them again. Next time I will try applesauce as other reviewers suggest.

This recipe is awesome!  I reduced the butter, opted for fat-free sour cream and they tasted great.  Rave reviews from family members and co-workers.  Really moist muffin w/a yummy, crunchy topping.

One more 5-star review can't hurt, right?  I made these this morning, and they are delicious.  I used half applesauce and half oil, and half wheat and white flour.  I also made them in a jumbo muffin pan (which I slightly overfilled), so the cook-time was longer.  They really are delicious, though, and I can't wait to use the topping for other recipes.  Pumpkin pie, anyone?

First off, one batch made 24 mini muffins and 6 regular ones. I just slightly ground the oats, a few quick spins in the Magic Bullet. I omitted the walnuts (we're out!), added maybe 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, and used margarine instead of butter in the muffins. I used cartoned eggs and fat-free sour cream. I omitted cinnamon and walnuts from the topping. They turned out awesome! They flattened out a lot (and almost overflowed!) but that could be my fault with using some fat-free ingredients. Thanks, Kimberly, my daughter was scarfing the mini muffins!

these were pretty good just out of the oven.  but the next day the oats on top became a little tougher and didn't have that crunchy effect anymore.  the kids (ages 6 & 12) and the dh also liked a lot.

These were delicious, especially right out of the oven.  The topping made these muffins!!  I got 18 muffins out of this instead of 12, but I think I may have smaller muffin tins than others.

I really liked these muffins and I even forgot to put the topping on. They were still sweet and good.

This is the best muffin recipe I have ever made -- I used low fat sour cream and skipped on the topping to cut down on the fat and calories -- they are delicious and soooo moist!

Thanks Kimberly!  These are the best muffins I have ever made.  I now have a use for all my over ripe bananas.  The topping made them taste even better!
