Today is my son's birthday and this is the third year he has requested this cake. I mix the cake according to the directions and it comes out moist and fudgy. The almond extract really compliments the cherry filling. I make this in two 9 inch round cake pans and bake them for 35 minutes.Instead of the glaze I frosted it with chocolate icing. I topped the cake with about 1 cup of additional cherry pie filling and used white icing piped around the edge to keep it from running over the sides. It looks gorgeous when finished. Everyone thinks it's from a bakery. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this cake in a bundt pan and drizzled cherry pie filling on top of the chocolate glaze.  It was wonderful!

Divine and easy. Hubby gave 5 stars and he is hard to please. I used Pillsbury moist supreme devil. I added 1/2 c oil & 1/2 c water. I also placed batter in 2 greased 9 inch cake pans baked 30-35 minutes. I cooled the cakes and in between the layers I put chocolate icing then covered the entire cake with it. So good!!  Icing simple: 4 & 1/2 c confec. sugar, 1/2 cup milk, 1 c soft butter, 1 & 1/4 c cocoa, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Beat butter, then add rest and beat....so good and like I said easy

Okay, I hesitated giving this five stars because I didn't really make this. I had every intention of making it. I went to my cupboard (like old Mother Hubbard) and all I had was a caramel cake mix and apple pie filling. Another recipe was born. I followed the same premise using caramel cake mix, white chocolate chips and apple pie filling (I chopped the apples finer). Instead of the almond extract, I used 1.5 tsps of butter flavoring and 1.5 tsps of rum extract.  I heated some caramel frosting and used that for a glaze. It was a major hit and the entire cake is gone. My brother's best friend said it's the best cake he's ever eaten. I can't wait to try it the "right" way.

This is hands down a great recipe!  We have used it for 4 years for our church dinner theater and I just pass the recipes out to the cake bakers and the all 25 cakes come back perfect!  It's almost fool proof!  We wanted to change our dessert this year, but with 4 of use looking couldn't find a better recipe!  It tastes great, is so easy, and when put on a plate drizzled with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, a cherry and a wedge of chocoate, it looks and tastes like heaven.  If you're looking for an easy recipe, but still want it to be something special- look no further!  We do mix the mix according to its directions (including the oil), then add all the goodies, rather than just using eggs.

Just made this cake for my husband's birthday and it turned out great. I made the cake almost to the recipe but made only minor changes. Instead of regular chocolate chips which some people on here said didn't work out so well, I used mini chocolate chips and it was perfect. I also saw on another recipe the use of Black Cherry Soda in the cake so I added about 6oz of Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda to the mix. I also used a chocolate frosting recipe I got from America's Test Kitchen and then decorated it with chocolate covered cherries. FANTASTIC!

Well, my hubby requested BFC for his birthday this year, so I made this one. Not so great!  First off, the cake ends up being a little bit dry, because there is hardly any moisture in the cake itself. It looks great coming out of the oven, and the taste is okay beause the base is a cake mix. I didn't personally care for the taste of the chocolate chips in the cake either.  Overall I didn't care for this, and I like chocolate cake!  The absolute WORST part of this was the frosting! Oh my goodness.... too sweet! (Like, makes the roof of your mouth itchy sweet.) If you like the type of frosting that is on Texas Sheet Cakes (and we don't), then you'll love it, because that is exactly what it is, without the pecans on top. Wish I had known! It would have been much better with a simple chocolate ganache or melted canned frosting drizzled on the top.  Adding the pie filling to the cake mix was the only thing I'll take away from this recipe.  Other than that, it was a big waste of money on our tight budget.    I would NEVER make this again.  But for those still contemplating this one, try this - get TWO cans of cherry pie filling. Make the cake in two round pans, and put the extra pie filling inbetween and a layer on top.  It might help rescue this one. Be prepared for a sugar rush...

Made this one for an anniversary.  Easy and really moist.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond and spinkled walnut pieces on the chocolate glaze while it was still warm.

I made this cake twice in a weekend for birthday's and it was a hit!  I made the cake as directed but instead of the chocolate topping I put real whip cream and mixed it with mini chcoclate chips.
This cake came out very moist and very tasty.

Excellent!  I made it in a bundt pan instead of the 13 x 9 pan.  Makes for a prettier cake!  The entire family loved it!

I made this cake for a pot luck dinner. At the end, it was the only one completely gone!! It was very moist and easy to make. I used a bundt pan because I like the way it looks. I decorated it like Donna's. Next time, I will make the glaze a little thinner, so it will run down the sides. My glaze was more like a thin frosting. This is a must for chocolate lovers. I used Reddi Whip in the can, and it was delicious! One man even went back to get seconds (the last piece)!!
Thank you for sharing.

Made this in a bundt pan, took 55 mins.  Used a Duncan Heinz mix, 1/3c oil, mini choc chips, and only added 1 tsp of almond extract (which I will increase a little next time).  I'm not a super big fan of Devils Food cake, so I may try another kind in the future, but this was still really good.  UPDATE:  This was much better the next day!  More moist and the flavors melded together (no need to change cake mixes).  Increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

Besides being quick, it is easy!  I took this to a church potluck (the ultimate evaluator), and it was well received--delicious, moist, yet held together very well. The pie filling I used was "no sugar added" and it still turned out well.  I baked it in a bundt pan; I feel it is prettier that way.  You could use other icings, but this one is easy and goes well with the cake.

I signed up just to be able to review this cake! It is so easy and moist and has a wonderful flavor combination of chocolate, cherries and almond. I am making it once again for a family party. It gets rave reviews! I am usually a baker from scratch but this recipe is worth using a boxed cake mix. I make it in a bundt pan and follow the cooking time on the cake mix watching it in the last few minutes. This is a mouth-watering cake!

Very moist cake.  I also was not able to find a cake mix w/ pudding - I used Duncan Hines Supermoist Devil's Food cake and followed the rest of the recipe as written as written above.  I made as a bundt cake and cooked for 60 minutes.  I got several compliments - thanks for sharing your recipe.

The recipe was a little vague, but I wound up with a 5 star cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. I made a huge layer cake- 2 9X13 cakes. In each cake I used 1 devils's food mix (dry mix plus I added 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup water from box directions) ,3 eggs, 1 pouch non-instant pudding (not prepared), 1 can cherries, reduced to 1/2 cup MINI choc chips, reduced to half tbs almond extract. I used 1 box of instant pudding (prepared) for the filling between the layers. I made all this the night before and layered, wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated. I did not use the choc glaze. I used whipping cream and some conf sugar with dash of vanilla for topping. I put the rest of the bag of mini choc chips up the sides of the cakes. I used some reserved cherries for garnish. Next time I will get about 12 fresh cherries for garnish instead. This was SOOO good and almost every guest took home seconds. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this into cupcakes and topped with the glaze, whipped cream and a cherry.  Tons of compliments on how it looked, zero on how it tasted.  I wasn't thrilled with the taste.  The cake is very dense and doesn't rise much.  I think maybe I'd prepare the cake mix as per the directions then add the cherries in so it is fluffy and light.

I followed the recipe to a t.  I am not impressed.  The chocolate chips are not necessary.  I will have to do this recipe again since there were so many good reviews.  I had to read the recipe 10 x to see if something was wrong.  Are you supposed to make the recipe on the box of cake mix first then add everything else.  It is unclear.  I didn't do that, which seemed weird.  Because in the cake mix recipe, you are supposed to add milk or water.  It seemed far too dense.  And, honestly chips were too hard.  So something must be wrong.  I wish it would say, make mix according to directions on box.  I think that is what to do.  Very confusing and I wasted alot of money here.

This recipe was really a hit with everyone at our Oktoberfest party.  I baked the cake in two nine inch rounds, and split another can of cherries between the two layers and the top of the cake for a beautiful presentation.  I skipped the glaze, although had I made this bundt style, I definitely would have made it! Great, easy recipe.  Love the chocolate chips in the batter!  Thanks!

This cake was delicious, made it for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake so far. I did tweak this a bit and did an experiment however. I bought 2 tiny bottles of rum. I added one bottle to the batter, and half of the other to the glaze. So.. mine was more of a Rum/Black Forest cake.. I highly recommend the addition of rum.

This makes a very pretty and rich cake.  I will make this again, it is so simple.  I baked it in a bundt pan instead of a 9x13.  I also used cake mix I had on hand, which did not have pudding in it.  I subbed vanilla extract for the almond.  My glaze came out really thick and just sat on the top of the cake and didn't roll down the sides like it should, but I was able to save it.  After the glaze cooled I was able to pull it off of the cake and I made more glaze; but added 1 extra tablespoon each of butter and milk and it came out perfect.

Made as directed, but put in a bundt pan dusted with cocoa powder & decreased almond to 2 teaspoons.  My daughter recquested it for her 11th birthday, she loved it!  I am not a fan of black forest cake and I thought it was delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I tried another black fores cake recipe and totally messed up the frosting and did not have time to make aonther from scratch so I made this one instead...Boy am I glad I did!!!  It was a show stopper!  I made this in a bundt pan and drizzled the glaze over top.  Once set, I topped with a few marachino cherries.  It looked beautiful!!!!

According to my husband this is a very good cake. I don't like cherries with chocolate so I can only go by what he says.  I did add 1/2 cup of vegetable oil for extra moisture and baked it in a bundt pan.  I used Duncan Hines icing and heated it in the microwave and pour it over the cake.  It gave it a beautiful glaze.  I used Pillsbury devils food cake mix with pudding.  He thought it was great.

Easy and delicious.  I did not add the almond extract and people liked the less "cherry" flavor that resulted.

WOW! Yum!  This cake is delicious & moist.  I had black cherries that I had picked, pitted & froze myself, so I used those after thawing.  I added 1/3 cup oil.  I used the mini chocolate chips.  I used 2 round cake pans & baked for 45 min.  They were perfect.  I also made the glaze but added more confectioner sugar to make it more firm.  It was hard to spread & not pretty but tastes like fudge spread on it.  Sooo yummy!

Love this recipe!  I do bake it in a bundt pan for about 55 min. and when I'm in a hurry, just sift powder sugar over the top of it, instead of making the glaze- gorgeous, easy to make, and everyone raves!!

Nobody was impressed by this cake.  The almond flavour was SO overpowering!  It's all we could smell and taste.

I LOVE black forest cake. I was looking for a quick recipe using the ingredients I had; this one is a total winner! Like many other reviewers, I made the box cake as directed, adding the pie filling and choc chips at the end. It was deliciously moist. I forgot to add the almond, and even though it didn't "need" anything extra, I will use it next time. I made mine in a bundt pan (I almost always use it instead of a sheet cake).

I brought this cake to a potluck at work and it got raves.  It is so easy to make, you can hardly believe the way it comes out.  I added the whipped topping on top for a fantastic finish to this cake.  Thanks for a quick and wonderful recipe.  I will make this again.

This recipe would be a five star but I always have trouble getting the glaze to turn out.  After fixing it several times as written my favorite variation is to make it a bundt cake and use the satiny chocolate glaze recipe by Ginger.  I've also fixed it in a casserole dish and topped it with more cherry pie filling and whip creme.  It's wonderfully decadent that way! Either way it's an easy cake to make and receives wonderful compliments.  My very picky aunt even asked for the recipe!  Note--if you need to make this gluten free I've tried this recipe with the Betty Crocker Devil's Food gluten free mix and it turned out great.  No one knew the difference.

I read the reviews AFTER I put it in the pan, but decided to go with the original recipe anyway. I am so GLAD I DID! I did NOT add oil and water--maybe why it was dry to some was that it was overbaked. I checked it in about 30 minutes and it was puffy and done. I just used a regular devils food cake mix (no pudding) and served it with whipped topping--it was delicious!! I will be making this cake often!  Its a WINNER!!

Amazing!  I made this for my boyfriend with a few changes because he can't have regular chocolate.  I used a white cake and white chocolate chips instead!  It was a beautiful pink cake and the white chocolate was the perfect topping!  It was so moist--I can't wait to have it again!

This Cake is sooooo good, my kids love it!  The only change I made was to omit the chocolate chips in the batter but did everything else as the recipe stated and will be making this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this in a bundt cake pan and it was just ok.  I love chocolate but the chocolate chips are just to much. I will make again but I will leave out the chocolate chips next time. I also like a lot of cherries so next time I will use two cans instead of just one. I think that making these changes will definetly make it a five start cake!

I tried this recipe on Christmas Eve (which was a risky little move!) but it fantastic.  I didn't have almond extract so I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract instead.  The batter seemed a little dry so I was particularly wary but it was fantastic. I baked the cake in a bundt pan and decorated it with cherries and whipped cream.  I think I'll use the glaze recipe on other cakes too!  Thanks!

This is a delicious cake and easy to make I make this whenever I give a treat to someone because it is fast, easy and delicious! But one precaution make sure you really whisk the icing. If you don't it results in a chunky icing.

Made this for a guest who loves black forest cake. This was fantasic! Very moist and choc full of chocolate and cherries. I baked in a bundt pan, and it turned out perfect..50 min. I followed recipe to a tee, but next time might frost top with a thicker chocolate frosting. Nice with cool whip too. My husband who is not a cake eater loved it, and I am a true cake snob, and will make this again! Thanks for a winning recipe!

what a beautiful cake, and so easy.
the only modification i made to the recipe was to add the water and oil that the box called for the cake.
i put the glaze on top and then cool whip and a few cherries.  nice presentation, and guests really enjoyed it.

I have made this cake multiple times as it is delicious. The only thing I would recommend is using Duncan Hines cake mix, the pillsbury with the pudding mix in it does not come out as moist or as flavorful. I also  make it into a layer cake by spreading additional pie filling as well as whipped frosting between the layers. I used the "cool whip frosting" from this site and it pairs perfectly with the rich cake.

This is my go-to cake recipe anytime I need to make one for my mom (she loves chocolate and cherries). I have made it a few times; however, I only just noticed the time before last the size of the cake mix. My grocery store does not have 18.25oz cake mixes in devil's food. So what I did this weekend was buy the regular 15.25oz without pudding in the mix. I also bought a 3.9oz instant chocolate pudding mix and used most of that to get close to 18.25oz. This resulted in a super moist cake! Like many others, I also use mini chocolate chips. Until this weekend I would make the glaze but eventually I realized it was too sweet, so I made the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting from this site. It was amazing!!

This cake was very chocolatey, dense, and easy.  Perfect for my chocoholic sis-in-law's bday.  I did not have canned cherry pie filling but I had canned sweet cherries so I made pie filling in a saucepan with some of the juice mixed with cornstarch, sugar, a little lemon juice, and almond extract.  I also used mini chocolate chips instead of regular size as suggested by a reader.  The cake is a bit on the dry side when served (serve with whipped cream or ice cream) but the few pieces left over were quite dry the next day.  I would like to find a way to make it even more moist (was thinking of soaking in cherry brandy) but it was not overly dry that I would not recommend. I think stemmed, hand-dipped dark chocolate covered cherries would make the best decoration (as a last minute thought I picked up a box of regular chocolate covered cherries from the grocery store).

This was my alternative to the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe.  I didn't have pudding and wanted to avoid a trip to the store.  Thank you Donna for this wonderful recipe.  I made it for the girls at work for one of their birthdays.  To my surprise the birthday girl does not like cherries combined with chocolate, but everyone else was in LOVE with this cake.  It was so easy and we all enjoyed it so much.  I did try another glaze with 4 ingredients that another user mentioned...again because of lack of ingredients.  It would have been great with nothing on top too....SO YUMMY!!!  I made it in a bundt pan and baked for 45 minutes.  My stepdad loves cherry so this will be made again very soon for him.

Absolutely delish! I didnt have the almond, so i used vanilla. I swear, we tried to save this for dessert.. we really tried lol but everytime i went in the kitchen, someone was cutting a small sliver of it lol. SO GOOD! My husband runs a restaurant and even thought of making a large version to serve there. We used the chocolate glaze you find in the frosting area of the cake aisle on top of the cake. SOOO YUM!

I made this into cupcakes, topped with a different ganache recipe I love, whipped cream and a cherry. (like another review picture) because I made them into cupcakes and I didn't have pudding in the mix, I did add half the amount of oil and water the box called for. They were Moist! Rave reviews from all who ate them. I would probably only put a 1/4 of the oil and water next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and LOVE this cake.  What I wish I had known to do... make it in a bundt pan.  It would be very pretty, but I didn't print the photo and since the recipe says use a 9X13 inch pan... that is what I did.  I made my own icing only because I ran out of chocolate chips.  But I give it five stars just the way it is!

Thank You! This is the absolutely BEST chocolate cake I have ever made, and it was one of the easiest!  It was very moist, had great flavor and everyone loved the chocolate chips.  I did not use the topping listed, I used home made whipped cream...YUMMY! Port wine really is the perfect wine to have with this cake.

I've made a similar version of this cake for years, and add 1 small box of instant chocolate pudding in addition to the box of chocolate cake mix with pudding in it, and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil which makes it a pudding cake so dense you need to refrigerate it to keep the cherries from getting rancid. You can, also add some almond extract to the glaze for additional flavor.

I made this cake as suggested in earlier reviews by following the directions on the cake box, adding all the extras next and then baking.  Made it in a bundt pan the day before eating. Served with real whipped cream...heavenly. It was quick, good and still impressive even if not authentic.

This cake was verrrrry sweet, and I left off the glaze.  My daughter & I made it together (she's 6) so baking it together was easy & quick.  If we make it again, we will not add chocolate chips, as I think that's what made it too sweet for us.

Not enough cherries. Next time I will add two cans, and maybe even dump 1/2 the batter in pan, then cherries, then cover with the rest of the batter.

This recipe turned out great! My husband, who doesn't like cake, even rated it a 4 star...My daughter on the other hand, gave it a 5. I prepared it mostly as the recipe stated, except I used the Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate mix like others suggested. I sifted powdered sugar over it to garnish, along with a couple cherries I reserved. It looked great and tasted even better! Thanks!

This is a very easy and delicious, quick cake.  I made it for my brother's bithday and the family wolfed it down.I use about half the almond extract (there is still PLENTY of sweet almond flavor) and topped the icing with mini-chocolate chips.  Served with homemade whip cream and this one is a hit!

I was looking for a recipe just like this..easy, and delicious. To save even more time, you could just frost it with a store-bought frosting, but the glaze is so simple.  I thought it was great, moisty and flavorful.

Very, very good recipe. Loved it.  Very sweet.  I used a bundt pan and it turned out great.  I didn't use the glaze. Instead, I used Betty Crocker's "Whipped Cream" frosting, heated it in the microwave, and drizzled it on top as a glaze. YUM! Thanks for the recipe. Will be using it again and again.

This cake is awesome. I used no sugar added cherry pie filling, with Splenda to cut down on some of the sugar. it didnt change the richness of this cake one bit. Everyone loved it. I served it with whipped cream and a cherry on top. I will be making this cake again and again. Very fast, very easy. The glaze was good but I think it would be just as good without it as well. Thanks for such a easy, awesome recipe.

This cake was quick, easy, and ohhhh, so good. I used a german chocolate mix because that was all I had. I also used milk chocolate chips because that was all I had. I added some chopped almonds to the icing. I loved this recipe, thanks Donna.

It is an excellent cake but I made the
mistake of using granulated sugar instead
of confectioner's sugar as recipe
indicated..next time I will use the
proper sugar and I'm sure it will be
even more fantastic...I made it for
Valentine's Day and my husband loved it
as did I!

I have a standing order to bring this cake to any family get together.  I never have any leftover, so I think they love it.  I'm never telling them just how easy this cake is to make.  
I make it exactly as written, but I use a bundt pan instead of a 9 X 13.  I bake in a 350 oven for about 40-50 minutes.  If your toothpick isn't coming out clean, make sure you're not pulling it through melted chocolate chips.   

Serve with a small dollop of whipped cream.

This was okay. Wasn't as dark and dense as I would have liked it to be. More like a store bought cake, but it was still good.

Such a moist and light textured cake.  Did not add ingredients on back of box, just the eggs and cherries - as per recipe, and vanilla extract (can't use almond due to allergies).  Glaze was way too thick and had to use hot water to make it runnier.

I used thawed pitted cherries instead of the pie filling - used the cherries plus the juice.  based on the other reviews, I cut the almond extract to 1 tsp. and omitted the chocolate chips.  I also didn't make the glaze and topped with either Cool Whip or ice cream.  We both liked very much.

This is a terrific recipe.  Love starting with a mix. So easy.  Here is my variation.  I use a bundt pan.  Made a glaze starting with Duncan Hines dark chocolate icing, added two capfuls of cherry liqueur and microwaved for one minute.  I poured over the cake and let it set for about 20 minutes.  Then I topped with a squirt of whipped topping and and a cheery on each section of the cake. Everyone at the office just loved it.  Super moist and I'm not a fan of dark chocolate, but I tried a little piece and it was yum yummy!

DELICIOUS cake! Very moist and flavorful. I think it definitely would make a spectacular bundt cake (as shown in MANY of the pictures) instead of a 9x13 (as listed in the directions). I came very close to burning the cake and took it out of the oven at 40 minutes. (I wonder if the time listed was actually meant for a bundt cake?) I definitely will make again. The frosting (actually more of a glaze) was delicious, too. Might double the recipe next time if using a 9x13 pan.

I have made this a few times already and everyone loved it! I get a lot of requests for this cake. I do mix the cake according to package directions (with oil and water). I bake them in mini bundt pans and top each one with melted chocolate and fresh whipped cream.

Used a dark chocolate cake mix and can of dark cherry pie filling. Most amazing! Baked in a bundt pan for 50-55 minutes and just sprinkled with powdered sugar, didn't feel it needed the glaze to take it over the top! Very good and easy to make, will make again and again.

So easy and quick to make!  This has become one of my family's favorites with a few minor changes... only use 1 tsp. almond extract and Mini chocolate chips.  Sprinkle with sifted powdered sugar before serving.

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and everyone enjoyed it.  I frosted it with chocolate fudge frosting from the store, and I reserved a cup of the cherries to put on top, then put puffs of whipped cream around it.  It looked pretty and tasted good, too.  I did mix the cake according to directions on the box before adding the cherries and almond extract (which I reduced to one teaspoon).  Thanks for the recipe; it's an easy semi-homemade cake that seems really special.

LOVED it.  did it exactly how they said.  not too sweet like some of the reviews said, and the perfect amount of cherry flavor.  It was even better with fresh unsweet whipped cream on top. REALLY good for so low in fat.  One of my favorite new cake recipes!

AWESOME! Instead of cake mix I used the Dark Chocolate Cake I recipe. I also made the cherry pie filling from scratch the night before. I only added 1 c. chocolate chips so they'd be more hidden. I made cupcakes and topped with a little pile of the cherry pie filling and drizzled chocolate over them. I now have a reputation as an "amazing cook". Thank you!!!!!

This cake was the BEST I have ever had. I used to love German Chocolate, but this is my new FAV!!! Not only was it so easy to make and sooooooo sooooooo delish, but it looked like it was professionally made!  I was almost shocked that I made it!  THANKS so much for making me look impressive to all my friends! :P

I don't know what I did wrong but this was a disaster. FORTUNATELY, the birthday girl loved it but everyone else scrapped theirs into the trash.  It was heavy, dense, overly sweet...  I'm tempted to try again though as there are just too many positive reviews.

I cook for my self. I also ate it all myself.I need to make another soon. The mix was a little dry after I added a package of chocolate pudding.1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup olive oil took care of that. It could even use more cherries. Still a great cake.

Very yummy!  I would recommend getting a second can of pie filling to serve as a topping per slice with the whipped cream.  Do not leave out the almond extract - adds a nice dimension.

Excellent cake.  I was worried about it at first because it came out of the oven a little lumpy and hadn't risen much.  The good thing about it baking flat is that if you bake it in round pans for a layer cake, you won't have to cut the tops off to even them off.  I baked 2 9" rounds for 35 min.  I added a package of 5.9 oz chocolate pudding because my cake mix didn't come with pudding.  I used Mini semi-sweet chips  and added some simple syryp to keep the cake moist before frosting.  I then used the Chocalate Butter-Creme recipe to frost the middle,  top and sides, and then Rick's Special Buttercream recipe for some white icing that I piped along the edges of the top to keep in a resevoir of cherry pie filling that I placed on top.

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it - even my mom, who has never been a fan of black forest cake.  The description of this cake being easy, delicious and moist is Totally True.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is essentially the Pillsbury recipe for "Chocolate Cherry Bars" but with 1 Tablespoon of almond extract instead of 1 teaspoon. I make this in a tube pan using dark chocolate cake mix and just 1 tsp. almond extract, and reduce the chocolate chips slightly.  I don't think it needs frosting.

I just baked this cake for my brother's bday. It's yummy!!! I made a few changes:  I added 1/4 cup veg. oil and reduced the amount of Almond extract to 1 tsp. (trust me you can still taste the almond)  For topping: I used lite whip cream and flaked chocolate and strawberriees and almond flakes.   It looked pretty and tasted very nice.  Thank you :)

Truly an amazing cake. The consistency of the chocolate chips throughout the batter, along with the cherries, makes it taste phenomenal. I'd highly suggest some kind of whipped cream along with it!

I was a bit reluctant at first about this recipe, since I'm a total "from scratch" kind of gal.  However, my family and I were very pleased with the results...this cake is super moist and delicious!  And I made it exactly as written, no modifications.  Great served with vanilla ice cream!

I am making this for the 3rd time in a month.  The first time was my first time making this, and everyone who tried it loved it.  It has been requested twice more since then.  Great recipe -- It's almost too easy, it feels like I'm cheating.

Pretty, easy, and everyone loved it!  Different take on your regular chocolate cake.  I cut the maraschino cherries in half and put them all around the top of the cake, gave it kind of a polka-dot look.

Something about this didn't do it for me. It was really moist and tasted good but was missing something..maybe it's just me and I'm picky. My family loved it. Thanks for the easy recipe.

I've used this recipe for years.  In fact, I won first prize in a contest at work with it!  My version uses a jelly-roll pan, baking 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees.  That way, you can cut the pieces much smaller and serve lots of folks!

My family loved this recipe!  I used amaretto instead of almond extract and I baked in in a bundt pan- I snuck a little amaretto into the icing too.

great recipe. I loved it. I added only half the powdered sugar to the glaze, and it was perfect. Not quite as good as traditional black forest cake, in my opinion, but still lovely.

This cake was very easy to make - just assemble the ingredients and put in a baking pan.   I made it in a bundt pan as others suggested, and the end result was very pretty.  Did not make the frosting, but it was still a very good cake.  If you are a chocolate lover you will really love this cake!

This cake was alright, but not anything as good as a real black forest cake, and everyone who tried it said it was just 'ok'. I thought it was a little too rich, and not as soft as I generally prefer cakes. The cherries weren't as prominent when baked inside the cake either I thought. I won't be making it again.

Everyone Loves This Cake! A few substitutes: I used a chocolate cake mix with pudding and didn't add chocolate chips; chocolate frosting in place of glaze; and topped slices of cake with Cool Whip and a little chilled cherry pie filling.  Easy and delicious!

Very quick and easy to make and my family loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, but the next time I make it, I'll try using a bundt pan as others have suggested. I put the cake in the refrigerator overnight, and it tasted even better chilled, especially the glaze.

I'm sorry, but I thought this was not very good.  I didn't have 'pudding in the mix' cake mix, so I went ahead with the cake recipe with oil,water, and eggs--just to make sure it was moist enough.  Next time I'll try it exactly as stated; although, I doubt if I try it again.  All the cherries and chips sank to the very soggy bottom.  Horrible presentation (especially since I used a bundt pan.  I guess if I want a real black forest cake, I should take the time to do it right!

This is an incredibly rich, moist cake.  And it keeps really well too.  I made it on Monday night and it was still moist the following Sunday!  Hubby LOVES cherries, so this made the perfect b-day cake for him.  I used a cream cheese frosting since that's what I had on hand and it was dee-lish!  I might cut down the almond extract next time to one tsp.

This cake was great, and super easy.  I was a little dubious when I saw the batter, but it came out moist and yummy.  I used a tub of cool-whip and a second can of cherry pie filling to garnish the top. Thanks for a great recipe!

Simply delicious. I put a thin layer of whipped cream on top, followed by about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  My father-in-law & 15 month old couldn't stop MMMMmmmmmming & AAAHHhhhhing.  The absolute best black forest cake I've ever eaten!

This recipe is AWESOME. I copied someone else's idea of covering the cake with whipped cream and then sprinkling the top with chocolate chips. If anyone does this, be sure the cake is really cool before you add the whipped cream...mine wasn't quite cool enough and the bottom part melted a little, but it was ok. This was very easy, very delicious, and easy to serve in the 9X13" pan.

This cake is so great that you can smell it all throughout the house even when it is in the oven!  It looks great too, but you have to have the almond extract.  That is what makes the cake.  Without it, the cake is nothing.  The glaze is great too!

This is sooo good, after the glaze I frosted with cool whip and then sprinkled with the remaining chocolate chips. Served with cherries on top

I poked holes in the top of the cake before I poured the glaze on.  Best if served warm.  Great for chocolate lovers.

It was too sweet for my taste and the cherry pie filling did not stand out enough.  I used vanilla instead of almond but maybe Kirsh would have been more appropriate.

Wonderful, and delicious.  My husband thought it was like a gourmet "death by chocolate" dessert.  He is very discriminating about food.  Easy.

I made this using the recipe as is & found the almond extract a little overwhelming. I would lower the amount by 1/3 (2 teaspoons instead). Good quick recipe overall.

After reading one person’s review about dry cake, I chose to separate the eggs.  I followed the recipe but only mixed the yolks with the dry ingredients then folded in the whites.  I thought the quantity of almond extract was a bit high so I also reduced that amount to 1 tbsp.  Cake was very moist  and light.

Black Forest cake is one of  my all time favorite cakes. In yrs past, I'd always make it in the bundt pan as a layered cake with the cherry filing in the middle. I'd then glaze it and serve with whipped cream rosettes. This , of course, was  delicious, but there was always something super sweet about all that glaze sitting on top cake.  I often found myself scrapping much of it to the side.  However, after seeing some photos on the net of the cake being made in a 9x13 pan and served with ice cream, my first thoughts were, "Wow, so much simplier, but still with all the great flavors, win-win!!" I decided to make it as a " dump cake" of sorts, by following this recipe, but rather then creating a glaze for on top of the cake, I incorporated a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips into my batter. After baking, I let it cool to just below luke warm and served it wth vanilla bean ice cream. Absolutely out of this world rich and decadent good. My new favorite, simplified way, to have bfc. Of course,  if I'm needing to bake to impress , I'll do my traditional bundt pan version, or even a beautiful bfc trifle, but for an everyday dessert-this way will be my go to.

I followed the recipe for the cake (it was a little hard to follow as I wasn't sure if you were supposed to make the cake mix then add the cherries. I did NOT. I put the dry cake mix in the bowl then added the ingredients in this recipe. I used two round cake pans and baked for 30 minutes. I stacked the two cakes (nothing in the middle between them). I  frosted with a dark chocolate frosting and put about 10 oz. of cherry filling in the center on top. I surrounded the cherries with "Real" whipped cream from a can. It won "Best dessert" at a large picnic event!

The stars are for the cake. The frosting didn't work well but tasted good. I hid it under almond slices. I made the cake for my husband's birthday with the family here. The following day was Thanksgiving, so I stashed what  little was left of this in the freezer for husband to enjoy later. However, people wanted to skip the traditional Thanksgiving desserts and kept asking for this cake until it all disappeared. Will have to make another very soon. I included the oil asked for in the mix, but not the water.  Had ordinary store-brand devils food mix. Truly outstanding cake!

I made this recipe exactly other than the fact that I only found a 15 oz box of devils food cake mix and saw nothing about pudding involved! Lol 
Oh! And I did cut back on the chocolate chips IN the cake by about 1/4 cup. 
I chose to make this one for my sons 9th birthday because he’s never had Black Forest cake but he LOVES cherries! 
I drizzled the icing I made over the top in a cross-cross design and it was very pretty. :) 
This tasted unbelievably rich and sweet. It tasted similar to a brownie (possibly because of the melty chocolate chips). I think next time I’ll just use some whipped cream as a topping or something to cut back on the sugar.

It was a very moist and wonderful cake. It was served to a group of friends who raved about it, men & woman.  I substituted a chocolate fudge cake mix that I had on hand, but pretty much followed the directions otherwise.  The whip cream really added to the final presentation both in looks and taste.  The cake was so rich that the whip cream helped to cut the sweetness.

This was great for a quick and easy dessert! The only thing I did different was to get two devils food mixes in order to have the right amount of dry ingredients. (I used the scale to make sure I had 18.75 oz.)  While it’s not traditional Black Forest cake, it was quite tasty!

I will use a little less almond favoring next time.  I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the batter, so just used them in the  topping. I also made it in a bundt pan instead of the 9x13 pan, and baked for 45 minutes. It was very moist and had a good favor.

This is one of my go-to recipes for bake sales, birthday cakes when I don't have a lot of time. I add 1/4 cup plain flour for the high altitude ( I live at 6500 ft) It always comes out moist and delicious! It's not what I would call a Black Forest Cake, more like a chocolate cherry cake. Sift a little powdered sugar after the chocolate glaze has set. Yummy and pretty!

Made this for a party, everyone liked it! I of course did not eat any since I hate cherries. I made the cake as directed on the mix as some reviewers suggested and then added the other stuff. Made my mom's glaze recipe (satiny chocolate glaze) and put maraschino cherries on top and served with cool whip.

I haven't made it yet but have a question regarding ingredients. It says cake mix and pudding but doesn't say how to incorporate the pudding in the directions. I'm assuming chocolate pudding but do just add the powder? Or do i prepare pudding then mix it into the batter? Maybe I'm missing the obvious? I'm also thinking the cherry pie filling would be quite sweet and i find most pie fillings have a funny taste... maybe it's the preservatives or something else. I'm wondering if a can of cherries with the juice would work? I'd appreciate any advice as I'm considering making this for easter weekend. I'll be using gluten free cake mix etc.

Surprisingly moist despite being so dry going into pan.  Should have sifted my sugar for glaze, it came out lumpy

I have made this before but put chocolate chips on top of cake after it came out of oven.  
But have altered it with many different variations:  For a blackberry cake,  I use a spice cake and blackberry pie filling.  Or Strawberry cake mix with strawberry pie filling.  Actually the combinations are limitless.

i made the cake as a b-day cake for a friend. i used a dark chocolate mix i had.  didn't put the glaze on, it was rich enough without it.  but i bought whipped cream for the top.  very good and easy to make.

I made this cake 20 plus years ago and it remains a family favorite.  I substitute a 1/4 cup sour cream for one of the eggs.  I pour half of the batter in a bundt pan, sprinkle only a half cup of chocolate bits then spoon the cherry filling  on the batter in the pan and lightly press it into the batter, Top with the other half of the batter.   Comes out more like a filling.  When the cake is cool, I dust with powdered sugar.   Serve slices with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream - whatever the family decides they want to compliment the cake.   You can be as creative as you'd like with this recipe.
Never fails to be a hit!

This was a really nice and delicious cake! I made this with my grandmother and she and I noticed there was a bit too much sugar in the glaze. I would take it from 1 1/2 cup to 1 cup. Otherwise, it was great!

Totally delicious. Disappeared in a hurry. I couldn't find an 18-ounce cake mix, but the 15-ounce one we bought worked just fine. I'd make this again for sure. Add whipped cream on top and maraschino cherries... divine.

Made this recipe today using a Pillsbury cake mix with pudding.   Followed the recipe on box before adding pie filling and chips.   Used only about 3/4 of a cup of mini-chips.  Used one teaspoon of almond flavor.  

Using 1 1/2 cup whipping cream with a bit of icing sugar to stabilize, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 2 heaping spoons of white sugar.  Whip till stiff.  Used this for frosting with grated dark chocolate to decorate.  I had saved about 10 cherries from filling to decorate with.

Baked in a bundt pan as others recommend.   This cake was as good if not better than any Black forest I've ever had.   Will definitely make again.  Especially as it is so so so easy!

I made this in a 13x9 glass baking dish for ease of travel to a party. After pouring glaze over cooled cake, I added another can of pie filling on top of glaze, then topped with homemade sweetened whipped cream and shaved chocolate Hershey bar. It was a big hit!

This cake used to get me out of trouble at work!  I would screw up in the morning, bake it at lunch and have it ready for afternoon.  You can make it in a 9" x 13" with no problem and recently, we have had great success making it into cupcakes.  Makes 18 very large cupcakes, which freeze really well.  Ice them with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

This was my first attempt at any type of Black Forest Cake and I will certainly be making it again!  I followed another reviewers advice and added an extra Tablespoon of milk and butter to the glaze but I would skip that next time because I felt it was too thin.  I also decreased the almond extract to 2 tsp. based on other reviews. -I baked it in a Bundt pan and it came out looking great.  My father in law and husband even asked for seconds!

I'll jump on this band wagon! This cake is great! I did however use the oil and half of the water the cake mix called for because the batter was SO thick. I also skipped the chocolate chips in the cake. Turned out fabulous and moist. Doesn't even need frosting! I made it into cupcakes, took about 24 minutes at 350. Filled the cupcake pans pretty full. Will serve with real whipped cream for a birthday party tonight. Thanks for sharing!

This was an interesting cake.  The texture was surprising.  It baked up looking like a brownie, but it tasted like a very moist almost custard like cake.  The cherry flavor was great, but I was wishng it was even stronger.  I gave it 4 stars because of the use of the mix, but I have to admit, everyone lapped it up.  I did follow the advise of others who made the mix as directed and then added the cherries and chocolate chips.  Served it with whip cream and a cherry.  It looked pretty special.

I made this cake last night for a birthday dinner party and it was fabulous.  The only thing I can say is that I probably won't use as many chocolate chips in the cake next time because it was super chocolatey-rich but otherwise a fabulous, delicious and easy recipe.

This was wonderful. Unlike the previous reviewer, this is not meant to be an authentic german cake. This is meant to be a quick and easy recipe. Which it is. And very, very good. I made it as written except I skipped the chocolate chips added to the mix (just to reduce the fat/calories a little). We will make this often!

Excellent cake!!!  We had a devil food recipe w/o the pudding so we added a small box of instant pudding.  It made the cake very moist.

This was a big hit with my guests.  The only thing I would change is the icing recipe.  Just use a simple gaunche recipe instead (chocolate melted with some heavy cream).  I served it with some fresh whipped cream and was delicious.

This is just delicious!  I took it to my ladies' Bible study, and everyone wanted the recipe. I took whipped cream and cherries with me, and some ladies chose to use them, some did not.  Either way - it was a hit!! I've just made it again, and expect the same result.

This ireview is for the cake only. Very yummy & moist. Misread the instructions and left out the choc ships. I thought they were just for the glaze which I did not intend to make. Next time, I will do this in a bundt pan (instead of cupcakes) so I can try the glaze.

I had some issues with the glaze being too thick to drip down the sides of the cake (I used a Bundt pan), but the overall taste was delicious and it was very easy to make.

Excellent!!  I took this work and it was devoured in no time!!  I used low sugar cake mix, lite cherry pie filling and Less chocolate chips to make this lower carb and it still turned out moist and delicious.  I'm planning on making this again!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and he was over the moon! I used a Bundt pan and it turned out great. It's really easy to make, but people will think you slaved over it. Yum!

The cake is delish! The only thing I did different was not use the glaze, instead I made the Seven Minute Frosting 1 from this site. It reduced the calories to 216 each and the fat to 4.95. Not much of a difference but when you're counting those things it makes a difference. Next time i may try it with half the chocolate chips to see what kind of difference it makes since it would reduce the calories to 200 each and the fat to 4...so just a slight change....

This was very good. I made it as written, was a little worried about not following the box directions, but it turned out very moist, and we didn't think it was overly sweet.

I think the summary of this cake hits it on the nose.....Easy, delicious, and moist! I couldn't find my almond extract and it was delicious so I can only imagine it would be better with the contrast of the nut flavor!

Love this recipe and it's a huge hit every time I make it, but I do think the full 1T of almond extract can be a little strong.

This cake tastes great and was very moist. Next time, I will probably omit the chocolate frosting (its plenty sweet without it) and just garnish with a little powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream.

This cake is soooo good and moist, however I did make a few changes. I used Duncan Hines Dark Fudge Chocolate Cake mix and mixed all ingredients according to the back of the box. Then I added 1 tbsp. of chocolate pudding mix as well as 1 tsp. of cherry extract and cut the 1 tbsp. of almond extract to 3/4 tsp. I also added 1/4 c. of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. It came out amazing!!! I used a white almond glaze recipe for the top and then garnished with chocolate covered strawberries. Divine!!

Best cake EVER! And not overly sweet.Co-workers love this, even those  that don't like cherries. I use a Dark Chocolate cake mix and add 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup milk to the cake mix to make it really moist. The frosting always comes out a little runny, but that just makes the cake even more moist. Perfect for chocolate lovers.

Yummy and moist!  Not too many cherries which I think is good.  I cut the chocolate chips that go into the cake to about 1/4c.  It was just the right amount of 'suprise' in the cake.  I was a huge fan of the glaze.  Frosting can get to be too much for this desert. No one asked for the recipe or seconds, so I couldn't give it a 5.

My husband said it wasn't quite as moist as he was used to my cakes being but found it tasty nonetheless. I did not find any moisture issues. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested. I did serve with a dollop of whipped cream as well. I will probably change the icing next time though to a ganache with a cherry garnish or my favorite chocolate frosting, again, with a cherry garnish.

The cake dense, not very moist. Next time I'll whip the cake batter a bit before I add the cherries to make it more fuffy. The taste was awesome just needs more fuffiness.

We didn't like this that much.  It seemed way too sweet.  I felt the chocolate chips in the cake plus the chocolate frosting were simply too much (because they're essentially the same thing).  I substituted Amaretto for almond extract, as someone suggested.  People ended up eating around the chocolate chips in the cake.  I would omit them next time and perhaps skip the frosting and use something lighter like whipped cream.

Wow, this is my new favorite cake!  I made two of these cakes for a special family gathering.  I made them in springform pans.  They came out beautifully.  I was in a hurry with the glaze, and used all the remaining chocolate chips, so I had to add a little more powdered sugar, but it was so delicious and looked SO impressive, like a restaurant dessert!  I served it with a dolop of whipped cream.  The only thing that could have improved this winning recipe would have been some chocolate dipped strawberries for garnish, but it is January!

This is my son's favorite cake! I made this as a birthday cake for him and did a couple of things that made it even better.  First I made it in the 9X13 pan and after it cooled, I carefully sliced into two layers.  Poured the chocolate glaze on one layer and put the top on.  Then, like someone else suggested, I piped cream cheese frosting all around the edge and poured another can of cherries in the center.  It was awesome!

We loved this recipe!  I made this with a can of no sugar added cherry pie filling and without the glaze and it was still so good.  (I alos reduced the almond extract to 1 tsp.)  We served it with a little whipped cream, but ice cream would have been great too.  It was so easy too.  Can't wait for another excuse to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this cake.  I am not a great baker from scratch and this recipe was sooooo simple.  Now, I am not a big chocolate chip fan, so I omitted those and instead of the chocolate glaze, I just used a spoonful of cool whip on top of each slice when served.  My husband said it was ok, but he isn't a big cherry fan, but he said he will eat more of it (more for me though..yippie).  I will definately make this again.

I did not like this cake, my 5 year old wouldn't even finish her peice.  The almond extract was too strong.  Maybe if I had left that out I would have liked it better, but it was a moist cake.

This was a good cake with a nice almond flavor from the almond extract.  I could smell the chocolate whenever I was near it - so tempting!  I baked it as a bundt cake.

Wonderful cake!  I made this for my husband's birthday last year and he loved it so much he's asked for it again this year.  Instead of the glaze, we frosted it with fudge chocolate chip frosting.  May have been a little more chocolate than any of us needed, but it was VERY yummy!

Wonderful cake! My glaze was lumpy - don't know if I was supposed to cook it or if I dumped the powdered sugar in too quickly. Other than that - a HUGE hit!

This was a very easy/simple recipe to follow.  It is perfect for something home-made, but still easy.  Friends and Family were full of Wow's.  I definately reccomend this to anyone who wants a sweet chocolately treat!

This recipe was absolutely awesesome - thank you so much for sharing!  I used cherry dessert topping from Cherry Republic in Michigan (great source for all things cherry) and this cake was out of this world!  Also used extra cherries on top.

I don't care for chocolate much but I really loved this cake. It's very moist and flavorful. Big hit at the office party. Easy and inexpensive to make.

I made this for my son's birthday. Black Forest is one of his favorites. I served it with extra cherry filling served over the slice. The cake is very rich and we all thought it would be better without the glaze.Over all it was a hit.

This recipe was very surprising. I made this for my dad's birthday cake because it is his favorite kind, but definitely not mine. I had served it with cool whip...and OH MAN! I actually really liked it. The chocolate chips definitely are a BIG most; they just added something to the cake that made it exciting. I will make this again and enjoy it every time!

Quick easy and really was a hit at Oktoberfest.  You can taste just a hint of cherry in the chocolate cake.  Perfect!

This cake is amazing, even for those who do not love cherry pie filling!  I made it in a bundt pan and it turned out perfectly!  This is an incredible cake and super easy!!  I prefer whipped cream rather than the glaze, but all in all an A+ recipe!

I found this to be average.  But, enjoyable if you need to make something in a hurry.  I might make it again.  Thanks.
