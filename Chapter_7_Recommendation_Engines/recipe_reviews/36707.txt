I left out the olives (don't like them), and the salad was still colorful and had plenty of flavor. Don't cook the potatoes too long, though, or they'll get too mushy while chilling.

This is a nice change from the regular creamy style potato salad.  It's a keeper for me!

I changed this recipe somewhat by using non-marinated artichokes to cut the fat and by using fat-free Italian dressing in place of the vinegar marinade. I served it with some parmesean cheese and it was a huge hit. This is part of my summertime repertoire of recipes now. Thanks for posting it!

I made this for a picnic and it was awful.  I assembled it yesterday and put it in the fridge thinking that the flavors would blend overnight.  But today, it tasted absolutely bland and boring.  I wouldn't make this again.
