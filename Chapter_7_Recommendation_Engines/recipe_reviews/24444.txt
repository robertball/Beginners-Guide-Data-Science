I used 1/2 cup honey instead of the sugar and 1/2 cup molasses instead of 1/4 each of honey and molasses. I also used 1/2 cup wheat flour for part of the flour. I didn't have all the spices, so I used 1 tablespoon cinnamon (I like to taste my spice). I also used margarine instead of butter. I'm at high altitude and these came out very thin and flexible, or if I cooked them longer, crispy. I hardly tasted the peanut butter. I think these are a great tasting spice cookie.

We didn't add the ginger which was probably a good thing. They're good cookies but are more molasses cookies than peanut butter cookies.

Double the flour, and these cookies are fantastic. Oh, and don't call them Peanut Butter cookies, either. Got an earful from my PB cookie-loving kid. They taste more like gingersnaps.

Added 1/4 cup cornmeal as I'm always in the quest for a crunchier cookie living in humid Hawaii. Also added some fresh ground black pepper,  coarsely chopped roasted almonds and raisins. Rolled them in turbinado sugar and oh my they are great!

My ten year old wanted to make cookies, so we tried this. Although he added the 2nd 1/2 cup of sugar to the batter instead of rolling the dough in it, they were delicious and not too sweet in spite of it.  Will make again.

I really enjoyed making these cookies, they have a mild nutty taste with just the right amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground ginger. Chewiness and crispiness are balance perfectly. I love this recipe. Thank you!

The batter was really loose and I couldn't roll it into balls, so I added more flour.  I must have added too much because they ended up too crispy and lacking flavor.  I may just try again with  the measurements exactly as listed but a little more patience on my part in rolling them.

I substituted 3oz of cream cheese for the butter on a whim, and it created a smoother richness.

I used almond butter instead of peanut butter.  That may have altered the taste since almond butter has a much milder taste than peanut butter.  I thought they tasted like subdued gingerbread cookies.

These are very tasty, but the peanut butter is too subtle to notice, if you're looking for that. Also, as you do batches, decrease the cook time. My oven was well pre-heated and the second batch were a little on the dark side. I'll definitely make these again!!

the dough was really loose so I added some oats and then refrigerated it. It was good but I think they were too cake like for me.

I could've done without the honey.  Next time, I'll just substitute more molasses.

I liked this recipe overall. I changed it in that I used 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of the 1/4 peanut butter, 1/4 butter. Also I got 60 cookies out of the batch, not 36.
