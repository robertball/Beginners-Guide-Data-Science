I get so many compliments when I make this. I use dry onion soup mix instead of vegetable soup mix and everyone raves over it.

Use the Knorr Vegetable soup mix. It's better than the other brands in this recipe. I also added 1 cup of cheddar cheese and a tad bit of fresh parmesan cheese (about 1/4 cup). I served mine with tortilla chips. Thanks for the recipe!

VERY quick and easy!  Yummy taste too.  You can even reduce the sour cream a bit and use less mayo and it still turns out creamy!

This is a great dip; however I did not add the vegetable soup but did add a package of ranch dressing mix.

Was a tad boring - so I spices it up!  I made a double batch for a larger party and instead of 2 packets of vegetable soup mix, I did one veg and one onion, and through in some all purpose seasoning.  Turned out great!  Also attempted a low fat version â€“ I suggest you just run a mile after eating it, as low fat loses all body, texture and well, the flavor!

I added about 2 chopped green onions and used Knorr brand dry veg. soup mix (in my opinion it's the best).  This dip is great and so easy to make!  Great with bread, Ruffles, or veggies!!!

I only gave this a four star because again, used as a springboard to fit my own needs!  I used 'Lipton Herb Garlic' soup mix instead of vegetable and also added some cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I minced up about a  half cup of water chestnuts and WOW!!  What a great recipe.  THanks for the inspiration!! (oh yeah, almost forgot, only had canned spinach, it worked perfect:).

Has potential.  I agree with one reviewer that Knorr's Vegetable Dip is best to use.  Also add
on small can finely chopped water chestnuts, about
3 or 4 chopped green onion, and  one cup finely shredded swiss cheese.  Yum!

We love this version so much.  Even a brother-in-law who says he hates spinach dip says its not bad at all. Every week we take turns in the family making on thing we have never made.  This was mine. I had to use an envelope of dry onion soup mix the first time but it still turned out great. Both ways are awesome.

I have used this exact recipe for over ten years.  I have found that YOU MUST USE HELLMAN'S MAYO for the right flavor!  Period.  You HAVE to give it a few hours to chill for the flavors to "marry" (about 4 hours is prime).  It is ALWAYS gobbled up at parties, even by those leary of spinach, and even my six year old loves it!  I have used either Lipton or Knorr Vegetable soup mixes with equal success.  Serve on cocktail pumpernickel, triscuits, tortillas or my favorite bagel chips.  I have also tossed in some chopped artichokes and some extra mayo along with some grated parmesan for a warm spinach / artichoke dip on a whim and it was equally delish.  Super easy, much loved, and you can't go wrong!

The original recipe for this calls for minced water chestnuts. They really make a great addition, adding some crunch. Always a hit at parties.

This was a quick & easy recipe on its own, but I have a few suggestions. I definitely agree with the other reviews that the Knorr's vegetable dip works well. Additionally, I would use 12-16oz of sour cream as opposed to 8oz so the dip is creamier. The most important step to ensure the dip is not runny is to drain, drain, drain the spinach! Because this recipe is so simple, I would go the extra step by presenting it in a bread bowl...I used a round Italian loaf that I carved out and let sit overnight to harden for stability. I also let the dip set overnight in the fridge.

I lost my hard copy for this dip so I thought I would search the site for the ingredients I normally use-Generally I add a can of pimentos but this time I thought I would try it with sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil-Yummy-gives this dip a different zip-will definitely add the tomatoes again

If you do decide to use the mayonnaise, Hellman's tends to work the best.

I was aiming to have this taste better than store-bought! I made some slight adjustments based on what I had on hand...... I used 1/2 container of sour cream, about 1/2 cup mayonaise, and 1-8 oz. package of cream cheese warmed and softened in the microwave with about 2 tabs of 2% milk. I added 1 package of onion soup mix and the frozen spinach thawed. I added some spices in dashes--Salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, sage and crushed red pepper, which I also used as a 'topping.' It looks great against the spinach! The spicy-ness can be adjusted to your own taste.

This recipe is great, I did alter it some but only to my personal tastes. I used the Knorr brand vegetable soup mix, added about 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper, 6 ounces of chopped water chestnuts, and 3 green onions sliced thin. It was a hit at my work potluck and they are now asking that it be my signature dish.

I make this often to take to BBQ's, parties, etc, but use creamed cheese instead of the mayo and french onion soup (to taste) instead of vege.  Serve it in a hollowed cob loaf and there's never any left.

I use Knorr veggie mix as well and add green onion, and water chestnuts (chopped fine). I make it the night before, and add a whole squeezed lemon before serving to wake up the flavors. Hawaiian or pita bread goes well with it.

Simple and wonderful served with pumpernickel bread...if you are in a hurry simply sift the vegetable soup mix and microwave the dry veggies with a little water until soft... this way you can eat it right away and not hurt your teeth on the crunchy dried veggies!

This was the first time I had made spinach dip and this turned out very yummy! I actually liked the dip before putting in the spinach also. I thought the veggie soup mix gave it a lot of flavor. I wish I had noticed though that my spinach was not prechopped...

Your basic spinach dip. You cant go wrong with it. I followed directions as is. I used the Knorr Vegtable soup mix. Next time might try to change it up a bit for a different taste.

Eh, made this the other day when I got a craving for spin dip. I have to say I didn't like this. Mine was pretty dry it seemed like the spinach sucked up all the moisture in it. I loved the flavor of the veggie soup mix ( used lipton) and if I ever make this again I will be sure to chop the spinach up fine, add two packets of seasoning and another 8oz of sour cream. Thanks!

I love this recipe and I make it all the time with bread, crackers, and fresh vegetables on the side. The only variation that I do is I omit the mayo (it is still creamy without it) and occassionally I add some chopped onion to taste.

Just took some advice from other reviews...  I used 16 oz frozen chopped spinach (thawed, of course), 16 oz light sour cream, 1/2 cup smart balance light mayonnaise, and 1 envelope onion soup mix.  OUTSTANDING!!  Everyone loved it and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is close, but not quite complete, to a recipe that circulated for years. It also had added to it one bunch of green onions, one can of water chestnuts, drained, and it called for Knorr veg soup mix as others have suggested.

Made this a few weeks ago when I needed a last-minute appetizer - it was great!  I used cream cheese instead of sour cream and onion soup mix instead of vegetable based on what I had available and it turned out really nice.  I served it with a variety of crackers and veggies.  Thanks!

I didn't make this version but mine is pretty much the same, except mine has larger amounts and makes more....and also I add dried onion flakes to mine...I use 32 oz of sour cream, about 1 1/2 c. mayo (more or less to your taste), knorr vegetable mix, 10 oz box frozen chopped spinach (its easier than whole spinach which is harder to eat, the leaves are long!) and i add about 2 tbsp of dried onion flakes, but can be omitted if you don't have it.  (oh yeah, make sure you thaw out the spinach completely and squeeze out the excess water) I will use lowfat sour cream, and alot of people don't seem to notice the difference.  my portion is good if you have a larger group...i have also served this in a carved out breadbowl centerpiece and put bread pieces and/or chips, carrots and lettuce to dip.....definitely a party favorite!

Very good HOWEVER I used the pkg of Knorr's (is the best for this dip), added a SMALL onion, finely diced and 1 can water chesnuts, chopped. Gave it more bulk (so not too runny) and more taste. Served in a hollowed out sourdough bread bowl and was wonderful.

My sister and I have been looking for a recipe for this spinach dip for awhile and we finally found the right one.  It is great.  We have this all on it's own for a really naughty dinner.  Yummy!

This was so.. easy to make!  I was easily able to adjust the recipe to the amount of stuff I had on hand (I used a half bag of spinach-and then adjusted the other ingredients).  I will definitely be making this for my new get together!

Good startoff recipe. Use Knorr's Leek soup instead of veggie - you don't get the funky textured vegetable chunks that way.

Good dip!  Made it to munch on during the football game...our team didn't win, but the dip was a hit.  We had it with corn chips.  I only used about a tablespoon of mayonnaise. Still good.  Next time will try using the Knorr Vegatable soup mix.

This is delish!  I am a "fresh" over "frozen" veggie person - so I steamed a bag of fresh spinach instead to mix in.  Served in a rye bread boat with fresh cut carrots, califlower, broccoli & celery sticks.  Also put the bread that was cut out of the bowl on the side for people to dip.  Went over very well!

I thought this was a good base of a recipe that can be tweaked w/many variations.  The proportion of spinach to mayo/sour cream was spon on...not too wet and not too dry.  Didn't have veg. soup mix so subbed 1/2 package ranch, added 1 clove of garlic and some grated fresh parm, and a bit of dried chili powder for a little zip.  thanks for this quick and easy recipe with good proportion of ingredients.

Yummy.  I reduced the sour cream & mayo (used light mayo) to about a 1/2 cup of each. (Ended up adding about 2 tbs more of sour cream.)  I also used 2-3 chopped green onions.  Make sure that spinach is totaly drained otherwise dip will get watery. (I squeezed spinach thoroughly.) I used Knorrs vegetable soup mix per other reviewers but feel that Lipton's vegetable soup mix turns out just as good.

This is a 5-star recipe ONLY if you use Knorr's LEEK soup mix.  It's the best for this.  I always serve it in a bread bowl.

This was ok, your typical party style spinach dip.
Had a sort of fake chemical taste to it if that makes any sense. I think there are probly far better recipes of this type out there.

i only give it a three......it COULD be a five if you do what I do.  Add two cans sliced water chestnuts, a whole package of shredded swiss cheese, a dash of garlic powder, and double the sour cream (add a couple tbsp of mayo to taste)....YUM YUM, you've got a five now!

Very easy to make! although i would use a little less sour cream next time it was still way better than any dip you can find in the store!

Great starter recipe but use an envelope of powdered ranch mix instead of soup mix, add one minced garlic clove, and a few turns of the pepper mill. divine.

I doubled the recipe for a party I had last night, which may have been the root of the problem, but it seemed to have too much mayonaise flavour to it. I think I may have to go searching for a new recipe to match my tastes.

After trying a bunch of other spinach dips, this one remains my favorite. The others used too many cheeses, which made them too rich to eat more than a few teaspoons. The simple ingredients in this recipe keep the fat content down and lighten the taste, making it easier to eat. I used lite Mayo and fat free Sour Cream and my husband (who won't eat things that say "Lite" or "Fat Free", loved it. He ate it with sourdough slices, pretzels, and even spread it on his sandwiches. I can eat lots of this without feeling guilty!

I've been making this recipe for years, after having found it on the back of the Lipton Soup Mix box.  It is delicious and great served with Honey Wheat Thins, Hawaiian Bread, or carrots.  I've made it with Miracle Whip, too, which is great as well.  Also, once I tried it with the water chestnuts, and I felt they ruined the dip.

This is a great quick and easy recipe. My grandmother uses this recipe to make spinach dip and she never has leftovers! I would add 1 med onion and 1 can of water chestnuts, both chopped, just to add a little something different!

I'm giving this recipe a four only because I haven't tried other spinach dip recipes (e.g. with water chestnuts or shredded cheese) and can't say that this is "the Best!" recipe. However, it is very good and, more importantly (to me), easy. Just mix all the ingredients together, allow the flavours to mingle overnight (refrigerated), and you've got yourself a real crowd pleaser. Friends always ask, "Are you making your spinach dip?"

I take this recipe to work for pot luck every chance I get. There is never any left by the end of the day. I bring Club crackers and Wheat Thins to eat with the dip. Defiantly would recommend to everyone, I always get compliments.

A little heavy on the mayonaise and sour cream. Would add some cream cheese (light) and a little less of the prior mentioned. I would also sautee some fresh spinach before hand as it seems frozen spinach retains so much water it is nearly impossible to dry.

One of our favorites!  I sometimes use some low fat yogurt for the mayo.  Also add a little cajun seasoning and some garlic and onion powders.

I used a 1-oz. vegetable dip mix, 3/4 cup mayo (instead of 1 cup), added a dash of crushed red pepper, 2 tsp. of dijon mustard, 2 tsp. of ranch dressing, and 2 tblsp. of diced green onion.

The vegetable soup mix was too powerful, so I ended up adding another cup of sour cream, which made it a bit better. It was pretty good, but I've had better spinach dip.

This recipe is great and so simple.I made this for Christmas and everyone loves it. Only changes I made was I added some garlic and finely chopped dried beef. I got a round pumpernickel bread and took the middle out to make a bowl and toasted it as well as the pieces I made from the middle. Put the dip in and fill the top with the pieces for dipping and it is wonderful.

I used a hidden valley ranch packet instead of vegtable soup packet. I was a huge hit at the party!  I put it in a mini bread bowl and served it with sour dough bread slices. My friends love it so much they always ask me to bring it to parties.

This is worth 10 stars!  I made this for a boating cocktail cruise with friends here on our river.  Everyone devoured the stuff - I thought one friend was going to eat it with a spoon.  The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup of tomato/herb crumbled feta because I wanted to use it up.  Believe me, it was fantastic!  Wonderful recipe, thanks.

Easy recipe.  Consider using Knorr Cream of Spinach soup mix instead of the vegetable soup mix, using 16 oz sour cream, omitting mayo, and add about a tsp of fresh chopped garlic (or more or less to taste).

Delicious and easy! I agree with the idea of putting one packet of dry onion mix instead of the vegetable mix and using about 3/4 cup of mayo instead of a whole cup.

I have been making this dip for years and I am asked to bring it eveytime I attend a party. I make it exactly as written above and use the Knorr vegetable seasoning. I serve it in a round bread loaf. It's best with King's Hawaiian Bread, but sourdough is good too (if you can't find King's). I cut a hole in the loaf big enough to serve the dip. Then I use the insides of the bread to dip with. I buy extra bread to tear up to dip with. I never have leftovers!

Delicious...especially using Knorr's Vegetable mix. On the back of the package it says to squeeze dry the chopped frozen spinach. If you don't have time to fully thaw, just toss the spinach in water to finish breaking it up. I found that if you put the spinach in a dishtowel and ring out the towel, this makes the task of squeezing the spinach extremely easy. Hope this helps.

Very good recipe. Not quite what my husband was looking for, but it was delicious. I also added 2 green onions, 1 cup of shredded cheddar jack cheese and I used the Knorr brand.

This is ALWAYS inhaled every time I have made it. I completely agree with past reviews that it requires Knorrs vegetable soup mix. I go easy on the mayo and it always turns out fine.   The hands down, absolute best way to serve this is in a hawaiin bread bowl!! Sorry, but it blows the sour dough bread bowl out of the water!

I make this dip frequently for parties and every time it disappears quicker than anything else on the table. People love this stuff! I used to use Knorr's leek soup mix, but it seems that they have recently stopped producing it. However, the vegetable soup mix works just as well. I add one can of chopped water chestnuts and some chopped green onion too. I serve this dip in a sourdough bread bowl with wheat thins.

Add chopped green onions and water chestnuts and it's the best dip ever. I make it just the same and add these couple things. It's the most requested appetizer in my family.

Great base to start with.  I made mine with miracle whip, mainly because I can't stand the taste of mayo.  Also used 1 can of chopped & drained water chestnuts and a package of Knorr Cream of Leek soup mix instead of the vegetable.  Loved it! Kinda has a sweet addictive taste that I really like.

Loved it!  Let the recipe sit overnight so the flavors can truly melt together.  Don't use Miracle Whip in lieu of the mayonnaise--it will leave a bad aftertaste.  I also add 1-8oz. can of chopped water chestnuts for extra crunch.  I have also made this with Knorr's Leek Dip/Soup Mix and received rave reviews.  This is my favorite cold spinach dip recipe for many reasons--it is so easy to make ahead of time and tasty.

This makes a very good dip. I used Knorr's veg soup mix, and added a can of chopped water chestnuts at a co worker's request. I get requests for this dip every party now. I do make this  dip a day ahead for flavor.

It was delicious. It was a little too salty for my taste, so I took the second half and added more sour cream to it to take care of that. I will use 16 oz of sour cream the next time. I used Knorr brand Vegetable mix. I used Dukes mayo because it doesn't have any sugar in it. I am going to also try this with the Onion Soup mix as suggested. I'm on a Keto lifestyle, so this worked very well with my plain pork skins which is what I was looking for.

Fantastic. I used 1 Tablespoon of mayonnaise as noted in previous review. I also put in one wedge of Laughing Cow Swiss Cheese. Plus I used dried chives in place of green onions. I also added a splash of lemon juice.

This is the best tasting spinach dip recipe. I use Lipton veggie soup mix and don't add the water chestnuts. I have made this dip for Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, or anytime I am hungry for spinach dip. Sure beats the Frito-Lay version.

I added 2 tsp of grey poupon mustard and some Montreal steak seasoning.  I changed the veg packet to Hidden Valley ranch dressing packet.  Took it to work for a potluck with various veggies, and everyone loved it.

I made the dip for company and everyone loved it!  It was so good, I was afraid they would fill up on it before dinner was even ready.  It is really good and I will make it again.

Made this recipe many times, very delicious. Try heating the spinach dip with some grated cheese on top. Mmmm

This is a great base recipe. For mine I added green onions, fresh dill and finely chopped red bell pepper. This recipe was a hit, even though Spinach dip is not popular in Estonia and only I have eaten it before. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

I add a can of diced water chestnuts for crunch and sometimes garnish with diced tomatoes. Yummy dip!

This recipe is just a good, basic spinach dip recipe that you can doll up if you like.  I used marbled rye to accompany it.  Yumm!

I made this but I made a few alterations. I used knorr soup mix. Reduced fat mayo. I only used half sour cream and used half 2% milk yogurt to cut calories (it was still very creamy). I cut up half a firm tomato, a small yellow onion, and some green onion and I mixed that in. Hollowed some pumpernickel bread, put in the dip and it was a hit! It was the favorite appetizer at our thanksgiving.

This was OK, I used the Knorr Leek soup mix.  Added artichokes, green onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and celery seed.  It wasn't horrible but I thought the soup mix made it taste a little chalky.  I might try again with the vegtable.
