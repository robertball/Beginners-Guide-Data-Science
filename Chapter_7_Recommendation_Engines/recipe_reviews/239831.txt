It doesn't matter if you eat this because you follow a low-carb diet or you are simply too lazy to make tortillas (who, me?). Just eat  it! As the submitter writes, this does satisfy a craving, but she is humble. This is  more than a settlement for tacos. This is a great dish. No need to change a thing. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!  I used a taco seasoning recipe from this site and did everything else as instructed except I used fresh jalapeños because I didn't have canned.  I was wondering if I was supposed to drain the meat and decided not to since the recipe didn't say to and it was so good.  Thank you, I will be making this again for sure.

I hate it when people completely change a recipe.  However, after making this several time I felt the meat was a little bland.  Now I add 1 can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles to give it more flavor and a little more kick.  This is a quick easy meal your family will love!

For those who find this too much to make, because they live alone etc. There is a adjustment button on the same line as the Ingredients header on the right hand side. It looks like a pie with divisions. Next to it is a button that tells you the nutritional breakdown.

Uh...did anyone else notice the picture attached to this recipe shows sliced black olives and avocados?
Even so,  good low carb recipe for my files.

Pretty good! I missed the chips or taco shells, but since I AM doing low carb- that's to be expected- This is a super idea! I wouldn't have thought of this idea and it's great to have something besides chicken (Even my husband who is not on a low carb diet enjoyed it!)

Looks good, can't wait to try. Question: Why are there black olives in the picture but none in the ingredients?

You don't need to be watching your carbs to indulge in this recipe. So easy to make with ingredients on hand and eat right out of a bowl. A great blend of overall flavors.

My husband loved loved loved ths meal. I actually put the meat mixture in cheddar taco shells (the kind that stand up with a flat bottom). I also did not add the peppers since we both have sensitive tummies. Still tasted great!!!

Great idea to toss all the ingredients for a taco in a bowl --leaving out the taco shell.  You can easily add or subtract ingredients depending on your preferences.

I used the basic recipe but used taco seasoning from this site. I also used green olive jalapeno stuffed olives and pepper jack cheese. I added the salsa and sour cream together for the dressing it was delicious.

Easy weeknight dinner. I made with ground turkey and kept everything separate so wouldn't get soggy for leftover. Will make again!

I liked it but my boyfriend didn't. I guess healthy eating isn't for him, lol. I added black olives since they were in the picture, used turkey meat, and baby spinach instead of shredded lettuce (more nutritious). I also love cheese so I doubled that. i thought it was a home run, though.

I loved, loved, loved this on crispy lettuce. It was tasty and very satisfying. I plan to make a double batch and freeze in portions for a quick meal.

I love this recipe since I'm on a lower-carb eating plan. I can make regular tacos for the rest of my family and this is now my go-to on taco night. I can vary it any way I like and it comes out great every time! Its starting to catch on with others in my family too! and it's fast and easy. Great recipe!

I used low sodium taco seasoning, and added sautéed onion, chopped fresh cilantro, a can of low sodium black beans (drained/rinsed) and a small jar of salsa to the meat while simmering for added flavor and protein. This was very tasty; also used plain fat free Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.

A favorite in our house! No jalapeños though, my hunnie has a weak stomach.  We've added white rice for when we're really hungry (rice on the bottom, then beef, then toppings ). We make it with chicken breasts too. Ranch dressing works great if ur short on salsa and sour cream.

Excellent dish for a low carb life style. I also added chopped green chilies and a few sliced black olives. I served with low carb tortillas (3 net carbs). You can also add a dab of salsa. It's the real thing!

Nice and easy recipe. Instead of a bowl, I serve it with a lettuce wrap, for a more taco-like effect.

Low fat and low carbs are different things. The ratio of Fat to Saturated Fat is high, and this is not a lowfat recipe by any means.

“Best tacos we’ve ever had,”said my family!!  I picked this recipe as my husband and I are eating low carb these days. I wrapped ours in butterleaf lettuce and the kids in tortillas. By mixing all of the ingredients in the bowl, it made assembly so much easier and the food was served warm. Loved the outcome!!  Only small tweak was no jalapeños; just a persona choice. Yummm.

Loved it. I have been making taco bowls for years but it’s nice to have some good measurements to be able to make a lunch. The only thing I did different is stored frozen avocado slices to thaw for my lunch portions so they thought by the time lunchtime hits.

Excellent recipe!  I made it as the recipe is written. I left out the hot peppers because we don't like them. I used a taco blend from this site, which I made without salt. We didn't miss the salt.  I ate it  without carbs, but served corn chips on the side. Some of us ate it as a dip with corn chips for dinner(a big hit!)  One of us didn't like the lettuce mixed in. The next day I served it like a soft taco rolled in a low carb tortilla. It's yummy this way too!

I followed the recipe, except I left the jalapeños out. I thought there was way too much meat for the amount of other ingredients.

I am afraid to make this recipe like is stated in the instructions. The outcome could not possibly look like the picture.  Frankly, it was the picture that drew me to this recipe.

Been making this for years. We call it taco salad. Usually serve it with corn chips on the side. But just as good without, when dieting.

This is a take-off on Taco Salad from back in the day, minus the tortilla chips.  I alway use an Italian dressing (or oil & vinegar) in addition to a little salsa, since I'm not a big sour cream fan.  I'm sure you could find a low-fat version to add.  Yummers!!

Excellent. Full flavored. Only thing it's missing is the shell. I added additional cheese.
