Love this bread. It is simple and delicious! I did make a few changes.  I used 1 1/2c of sugar instead of the 2 cups, used 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce, used wheat flour instead of all purpose and since I didn't have enough zucchini on hand I used 1c zucchini and 1c shredded carrots. Yum!!

Wanted to try something different this time when making zucchini bread, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.   Greasing the pan is NOT ENOUGH. You need to flour it as well or you'll never get it out of your pan, especially if you use a bundt pan like I did.  I added chopped walnuts to mine.  Flavor was very good and ready to eat as soon as it cooled.  I find that with most quick breads, they are better if you wait to eat them a few days after baking- no need to wait with this one.  It even made a nice crunchy crust.

I have to say this is a very classic zucchini bread and it is perfect.  :D  We love it, a lot!  I hate all of the fancy schmancy recipes, this one is very simple and yet very classic, almost like Grammas!  Good job.

I followed the directions except I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil... if I can avoid using tons of oil, I do, so I did. :) I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Had absolutely no trouble removing it from the pan, used PAM and lightly floured my pans.  Very moist and Truly delicious!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely Delicious! I've made 4 loaves in the last 3 days and my family gobbles them up! I've added chocolate chips, coconut, and walnuts and it is so yummy. This is definately a keeper. It needs no modification at all unless you want to add any extras like I did. Thank you so much for sharing!

Help! The muffins and the loaf fell in the center! Also, too much oil for me. Smell delicious and taste good, though! I live at ~7600ft. could this be the problem? Also, the recipe says only 2 cups of flour but similar ones call for 3 cups. Misprint?

This recipe is simple to make, yet incredibly delicious.  I have never made zucchini bread until now, and it came out great.  I only added about a  teaspoon of vanilla instead of the tablespoon it calls for, and it was perfect.  Also, hazelnuts make a great addition for those who don't like walnuts or pecans, but still want the crunchier texture.

This came out great!   Moist and flavorful.  I made some alterations; I added 1/2 c. grated carrot & the zest and juice of 1 lime.  When it came out of the oven, I topped it with a lime glaze made by stirring 1/4 c. lime juice with 1/2 c. sugar in a saucepan until it boiled and the sugar dissolved.  I brushed it all over the tops right out of the oven and let it solidify.  I made muffins, too, 18 minutes in the oven was perfect.

Delicious and simple. I made them as mini-muffins, baked them for 15 minutes at 350. I also made one mini loaf with some leftover batter and baked that for about 37 minutes. I added some chocolate chips to the mini muffins for my son and he scarfed the down. Great recipe!

I plan on making this tomorrow night, and based on reviews it sounds delicious! But I'm wondering, do I need to drain/strain the moisture out of the shredded zucchini first? Thanks!

I have baked this zucchini bread twice within one week, now, and it is absolutely delicious. My three kids are already asking me to bake it again. The first time, I made no changes, and the bread was perfect - sweet, hearty, and nutty with the perfect amount of cinnamon. The second time, I replaced 1/3 of the sugar with Splenda, andit was equally delicious, if a tiny bit too sweet.

I made this recipe yesterday to try and use up the zucchini from my garden. The flavor is excellent, but thought the bread itself was a bit dry. This could be because I baked on convection bake instead of regular bake. Next time I will not use convection bake and see how it turns out

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect. 2 whole loaves gone in about 3 days. Used 2 medium size zucchini's which equaled just about 2 cups. Baked for 50 minutes. Making it again this week and will not do anything differently than before.

This was the moistest most delicious zucchini bread I've tasted. I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had 1 pan for baking. And I used whole eggs but that's the only change. My husband ate half the loaf in 1 sitting. Thank you for sharing! : )

this recipe was wonderful. my vegetable hating husband really liked it. the only thing i really didnt love about this bread was that it didnt seem to stay together too well...especially after it was warmed. i will certainly be making this recipe again soon, as i need to use up the rest of the zucchini. has anyone frozen this loaf? how well does it freeze,and will itnfall apart worse once thawed? many thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe

I made this for the second time last night.  The first time I made it, I made it exactly as written.  We thought it was to sweet and to oil.  This time I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also used 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons.  We absolutely loved the changes and will make it our zucchini bread recipe from now on.

I used half brown sugar (and olive oil, b/c i was out of canola!) and it was fab.  I could have done half whole wheat and still had perfect results.  Moist, sweet, and delicious.

Excellent! This recipe is exactly as advertised - a good, classic zucchini bread.  Only thing I changed was to add extra walnuts.  I always press as much liquid as possible out of the zucchini by squeezing it or pressing between layers of paper towels.  This bread had a great texture and I loved the cinnamon flavor.  Might try reducing the sugar or using applesauce for half of the oil, but really this recipe is just perfect!

Caley's Classic Zucchini Bread Haiku: "Mouthful of bread, yum! Made some wee "healthy" changes. Thanks so much, Caley!" Swapped the optional walnuts for miniature chocolate chips, and reduced oil to 1/2 c. adding in 1/2 c. applesauce, but didn't change anything else! Two lovely brown and beautiful loaves were ready in 55 min. and I don't know how I kept myself for diving right in w/ pats of melty butter and my cup of coffee. Upon indulging in a slice (OK, more like 3), I was in heaven. Sliced the 2nd loaf and froze for later, but truth be told, I'll probably be thawing it much sooner!

Made this today and it came out great! I followed the advice of others and only used 1 1/2c sugar and 1/2c of oil and 1/2c of apple sauce... I didn't have any walnuts on hand so I had no choice but to omit them...wished I would have had chocolate chips to add!!

This was my first time making zucchini bread. I made one loaf with walnuts and one with chocolate chips. My boyfriend had fun making it with me and we both loved it. Easy to follow recipe it was moist and tastes great. I followed a reviewers tip and replaced 3/4 of the oil with applesauce. I just need to find out how to cut out some of that sugar.

The best bread I have ever had or made hands down!  It makes two loaves, I was planning on giving one to a friend but my husband and I ate both!  It kept very nicely (wrapped in plastic wrap) and stayed extremely moist while holding its form.  An AMAZING recipe!

I misplaced the zucchini bread recipe I grew up with and have made for years, so I was rushing around to find a recipe this morning to use with some fresh garden zucchini. This was great! It is moist and has an airier texture than my original recipe because of the eggs beaten separately.

Oh my gosh, this recipe is perfect.  I followed it exactly and it was so moist and flavorful.  My 2 year old son could not get enough of it.  I also had my cousins try it and they LOVED it!  This will be my go-to dessert recipe for Christmas or Thanksgiving.

The texture was great.  However, it did not have a lot of flavor.  I followed the recipe but added a half cup of walnuts and half cup raisins.  I will try it again but will add more spices, perhaps some lemon or orange flavor, too.  I will try it again.

I made this quite often this summer with all my zucchini from the garden.  The recipe comes out very, very moist.  I found that using 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce made the recipe lighter and better in my opinion.

Very nice, with changes. I halved the recipe; I used carrots instead of zucchini; two large eggs; half white and half wheat flour; half vegetable oil and half unsweetened applesauce; a bit less sugar (still a bit too sweet). It's a great recipe that I will definitely make again...with actual zucchini next time,

Changes:. 1cup of sugar instead of 2
2 cups of bread flour
1/2 cup of whole wheat flour
1/2 cup of shredded carrots
Olive oil instead of vegetable oil
This bread was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

Everyone loved this one, especially the kiddos!
I used 1/2 C of Oil and 1/2 C of Applesauce instead of the whole cup of Oil, a little healthier that way and very moist.
I used mini loaf pans, baked them approximately 35 minutes (when knive poked into center comes out almost clean).
As long as my garden keeps giving me 3 zucchini’s a day (use normal size, not the huge ones) I will be making this bread to freeze for later.
Oh, I didn’t add the nuts!

I was cooking multiple breads when I made this, and ran out of vegetable oil.  So I ended up using half olive oil, and half coconut oil.  It turned out great - very moist and tasty!

This bread is AMAZING! I did change it up a little as one of the reviews stated. I doubled the recipe, used half the oil & the other half applesauce. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 of the amount, then I accidentally used Lemon Extract instead of the Vanilla--I am glad I did too! It was great! I am not hungry but I've already had 2 slices & I'm fighting the urge to go back for more while it's warm. This will be my go-to recipe for zucchini bread from now on! (May or may not continue to use the Lemon Extract!LOL)

06.27.17 ~ When I think of a traditional zucchini bread - this recipe is exactly it.  I have a lot of zucchini in the freezer and I'm trying to use it up.  I made this recipe and two others.  This was my favorite.  I got 7 mini loaves (6 x 3 1/2  pan size) from this recipe and had a lot to share.  I shared with girlfriends, in-laws and even the siding company where we are ordering our siding.  Everyone loved the bread.  I will be using this recipe, again.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made this.  It was wonderful!!  This time when I made this I cut back on the sugar because I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar mixture around the bread pan after I greased it.  My dad ate one loaf by himself!!

Turned out very good. I followed the advice of other reviews and used 1/2 a cup of oil and 1/2 a cup of apple sauce. I also replaced a 1/2 of cup of white sugar with a 1/2 of cup of brown sugar.  Next time I make this I plan on adding a 1/2 of teaspoon more of cinnamon as well.

I made it according to the recipe, but was disappointed in it.
It came out more the consistency of cake instead of this type of bread. I'll be looking for another recipe for this.

I made muffin!  I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of sugar.  Replaced 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour. Added 1 banana for sweetness.  Added a little more zucchini :) Only put 1/2 of canola oil.  Made exactly 12 muffins.  Yummy!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe except I used 1/3 cup of olive oil and 2/3 cup apple sauce.  This made 7 large muffins and one loaf pan.  Gotta run!  Headed to the farmers market to get more zucchini!

I made this today and though a little unsure about the 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract I stuck with the recipe but the bread came out flat and more like cake than sweet bread. Tasty all the same. Is the vanilla amount correct?

Great recipe for a classic sweet zucchini bread!  the second time I made this I added 1/4c chia and flax seeds and sunflower seeds for  texture and more fiber (we did not use nuts).  The original version or the modified version were both  fantastic.

My family loved this recipe. I used whole wheat flour, and almonds since that is what I had on hand and added 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. I also made muffins instead of bread and used 3 cups of zucchini because I have a ton.

It's super moist.  I use cane sugar.  Substituted 1 cup apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil.  I used pecans as suggested.  It turned out great.  I will definitely share this  bread with my friends and co-workers.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Yum. Love the cinnamon. Personally I prefer it with an additional half-cup of flour, to make it more cake-y.

Great zucchini bread.  I did make only one change 3/4 C oil instead of 1.  I also substituted yellow squash for a moister bread.

I made this pretty close to the original, the only substitution I made was one cup Spelt flour for one of the cups of white flour. That has never changed a recipe before so am not sure what happened. But, this fell a bit. I had to cook them longer as well. Next time I will add a bit more white flour and a bit more baking powder. The flavor was great however.

I  cut down  the sugar to 1 and /1/2 cups -- I used less cinnamon- 1 tsp>  then  added  1 cup each of choc chips and  chopped walnuts . My recipe made  2 small and 1  9 x9 loaf    which I baked  about  40 to  45 min-- took mini loafs out first then bigger loaf about 8 min later -- tasted  great! oh and I  added about 2 t. pure vanilla.
 I think  this is one of those  easy recipe to  change and fool around with- to one's  preference and  it  still comes out  great!

Delicious! Simply delicious! The bread I prepared was gone in a blink of an eye. Everyone -and I am talking about a gathering of adults,- went crazy with it. They all kept talking about the "gingerbread".
The best is that I FORGOT the oil and so I didn't add it; yet it the bread was delicious, just perfect!

In place of the vegetable oil I used virgin olive oil. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the recipe. I baked the recipe for 50 minutes. This recipe is very moist, I will be making it again :)

Delicious bread!! I added about a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the dry ingredients and toasted the walnuts before adding them to the mix. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon/sugar and brown sugar to the top before baking. Bread was delicious! Planning on make this again today and freezing the loaves for later...

I modified the recipe by using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, whole wheat brown flour instead of regular flour, and added a bit less sugar. (My small contribution to trying to eat healthier.) I also used muffin tins and baked them for 45 min., and they came out great with a crunchy top. Definitely, spray and flour the tin.  Very yummy.

Geesh!!!! Here I go again! Yep, I have to make more.  I didn't get any of the last batch.  I was only told that it was delicious and I should make it again.  I wouldn't know - I didn't get any! I do believe that earns a 5 star. My family is picky. This time I'm going to have some before announcing that I made some, he he he!

The taste is fine, but it came out too moist. I kept cooking it but eventually had to just take it out because the outside was getting brown and crusty.

This recipe was excellent! I loved it, my husband loved it and I took some to work and people couldn't believe I made it from scratch. I followed the directions to a "Tee" except for the sugar part. I only added 1 1/2 cups instead of two cups and it was perfectly sweet enough.

I like to try different zucchini bread recipes (tons of zucchini in the garden) and this recipe is what I would consider a traditional zucchini bread.  We thought it was very good.

This is the exact recipe I just dug out of my grandma's recipe box. Thanks for sharing! It may not be the healthiest recipe for zucchini bread but it IS the best tasting.
