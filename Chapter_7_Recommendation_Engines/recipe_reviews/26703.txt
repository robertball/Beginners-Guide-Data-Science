We're having poker night at our house tonight and I am serving a few appetizers. I prefer to try most of my recipes first before serving them and I was most concerned about this one. Bread, cream cheese and bacon? The combination sounded interesting but I was skeptical. Therefore, I decided to try it with dinner tonight first. There's not a single one left! Even my boyfriend, who shys away from cream cheese unless it is discretly hidden in the dish loved these (not that the cream cheese is very apparent though). Now I have to make another batch for tonight! Great recipe! Thanks for posting this Robyn!

This is superb choice for a hot appetizer.  I made these for my husband's birthday party and they were devoured in a flash.  I used turkey bacon sprayed lightly with olive flavored Pam (since he doesn't eat regular bacon) and chive-flavored cream cheese with a fews drops of tobasco sauce for a little kick.  Look forward to making this again with rye or wheat bread. Make sure you flatten the bread well with a rolling pin for the best results.  5 spoons up!!

These are really yummy, if you love bacon, you will love these! I could not find the Pepperidge bread (I am in Canada, maybe they do not have here?) I just used plain white sandwhich bread and instead of making the cream cheese mixture I used Philly Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese, Yum!

These are delicious.  My friend has made these for years and I have loved them.  But after reading the comments here I made  a couple of additions.  I added about 1/2 cup cooked and drained chopped spinach and 1 tablespoon Tastefully Simple Spinach and Herb Mix.  I cut both the bread and bacon into thirds rather than in half.  Also, rolling the bread, as suggested by one reviewer, made it easier.  Do not precook the bacon as some have said.  Adds a step that is not needed- you need the flavor of the bacon and your roll-ups are not at all greasy.  Just drain on paper towels.  Took to a party and were devoured!  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this appetizer at my Christmas party and it was the first to go!  My guests kept asking if I had any more hidden away.  My advice:  double the recipe!!!

I liked this, but I used flour tortillas instead of the bread.  It seemed to be a lot better versus using the bread.  Also, I crumbled up the bacon before I made the mixture.  I ended up preparing this a day in advance and then let it chill in the refrigerator.  This seemed to really, really help out a lot.  I made it once before and followed the recipe directly.  Then, I tried the changes and it seemed that the roll-ups turned out a lot better.  I took these to a get together and a lot of my friends loved them:):)!!!

These turned out to be pretty dang good.  I also added a little dry ranch to the cream cheese.  I made them for the super bowl party and they were all gone by half time!

I first made these as a appetizer for last year's Thanksgiving dinner.  And they went FAST!!  Everyone who had one HAD to have to recipe.  Now it is definitely used every time I entertain.

These had no flavor.  For the time it takes to make them - they are not worth it.  I won't make them again.

Love the simplicity of this app!  I use pineapple cream cheese (or I mix a can of pineapple w/plain cream cheese).  I roll out the bread with a rolling pin, spread the cream cheese, roll & then wrap with bacon.  I make these ahead of time, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze them. I defrost these before baking and slice while still partially frozen - it is much easier & cleaner to cut these while firm than once cooked or right after you roll them.   These are great to have on hand and each time I have made this app, they are gone within minutes & people always ask what they are and how to make them!

I was skeptical, but these were amazing!  I am kind of a snob about how my bacon is cooked (I only like it perfectly crispy or it grosses me out) and these turned out just right!  I also worried the bread might be soggy, but that wasn't the case.  I was having Mediterranean themed appetizers that night and this didn't fit, but I really wanted to make them anyway so I experimented and discovered I like them with roasted red peppers inside with the cream cheese (kind of a stretch, I know).  I tried lots of variations earlier in the day and decided that I didn't like them as much if I added any seasoning because it just distracted from the main flavors.  All the variations were still quite good, but none of them beat the plain simple ones--so why make it more complicated?  I will make these without any additions from now on!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good. Next time I think will try making it with crescent rolls instead though.

EVERYONE REALLY LIKED THESE. I MADE 22 FOR 4 PEOPLE AND THEY WERE GONE IN MINUTES. SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO MAKE AS AN APPETIZER IF YOU ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE TYPICAL DIPS. I WILL MAKE THESE AGAIN.

I usually don't change up a recipe too much but I got some tips on this one beforehand and decided to do them.  Same ingredients but with the addition of brown sugar.  I cut the crusts off Wonder sandwich bread (about 20 slices), spread softened cream cheese on them, sliced them into thirds, rolled those up.  Cut bacon slices in half, dredged them in brown sugar, rolled around the bread rolls, secured with toothpicks.  Baked at 400 until just starting to brown.  Turned broiler on and crisped them up.  OMG-these were gone in a NY minute at a super bowl party.  Had to recite the recipe several times.   Simple ingredients.  AMAZING results!!!!

Great little appetizer, but agree with others that the cream cheese needed a little seasoning - I think I'll try the garlic powder next time.  I used a light wheat bread instead of white and that worked/tasted great, too.

I made these for a party a couple weeks ago, they were gone in less than 10mins, my husband and his friends really enjoyed them. What I did differently was took a loaf of french bread split it in the middle horizontally and spread the cream cheese mixture(I mixed the cream cheese with a 1/2 packet of ranch seasoning) on both halves and added some shredded cheddar cheese to that mixture, cut the loaf into smaller pieces and wrapped them each in a half a piece of bacon, used the same cooking time and temp. Really yummy and different. :) Thanks

These were easy and delicious!  Added 3 Tbsp. of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing mix to cream cheese.  Baked at 375 for 20 min. on wire rack on baking sheet and they were nice and crispy without being greasy!

I have made these for years and they are always the hit of the party. I usually use cream cheese with pineapple which is so so good.  Cream cheese with chive/onion is also great - try whatever might be one of your favorites.  Heather

I thought these were yummy and easy.  Read some other reviews that they were bland.  Not sure I agree.  I did use multigrain bread and cream cheese with chives maybe that's why they're tastier?  Either way, easy peasy and delish...

I loved the various textures of these.  Crispy bread, creamy cheese, and bacon.  I experimented a bit, and tried some with plain cream cheese, some with cheddar and cream cheese, some with garlic, and some sprinkled with brown sugar.  Every single one of them was great.  I did up the oven temp to 425 to cook the bacon faster without burning the bread.

This recipe was simple to make.  Rolling up the bread and bacon got messy but not unbearable.  I recommend buying good quality bacon.  I went through 1.5 packages because some of my bacon was fatty and I did not want to use one strip of pure fat.  Also, I baked the roll ups for 30 minutes at 350 and it did not seem like enough.  I increased the temperature to 375 and baked another 10 minutes and they were perfect.  Before I served them I pulled out the toothpicks because I did not want anyone to accidently pop one in their mouth with the toothpick still in it.  I will defiantly make this again.

eating theese are like tasting a bite of heaven. you may want to cook theese a little bit longer then it they call for. Another word of advice- we made theese at a party for Jr.High girls and tried to go colorful using multi colored toothpicks and the girls were grossed out because the color was soaked into the bread. Also slightly melt the cream cheese before spreading it on the bread, it makes things so much easier.

I made these for New Year's Eve. My husband isn't fond of cream cheese, so I used a cheddar spread for most of them and cream cheese for a few. We both preferred the cheddar ones, so that's what I will use in the future. This was a great appetizer, not difficult to make, and even reheated well in the microwave. Thanks for sharing!

These are great!  I do mine different and these changes are AWESOME!!  I use cheese whiz instead of cream chease and wrap mine in baccon then sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar over the top!  They are so good and although the brown sugar may seem odd it actually bring out a wonderful flavor that will make you want to eat them all!!

I decided to try this out on my partner and I first - so I only made 12 appetizers.  Wish I had made more!  I prepared them earlier in the day, flattening out the bread with palm of my hand to make it thin for rolling and I was able to use a slice of bacon for three rolls.  I did not secure with toothpicks and found it wasn't needed.  Maybe because they were chilled in the refrig.  I will make this again using scallion cream cheese next time for more texture and added taste. Real easy to prepare, ingredients I normally have on hand for unexpected guests!  Oh, I also just used plain old white bread and I wouldn't change that.   This is a keeper!

This is a great quick appetizer to make but instead of using regular cream cheese, I substituted using cream cheese with pineapple and strawberry flavor. I like it best when it's right out of the oven.

This recipe was great!  I love a recipe that calls for such a short ingredient list. I used Natures Pride Nutty Oat bread.  I cut the bread up and spread them with cream cheese, I sprinkled them with Garlic Garlic from Tastefully Simple.  I rolled them up wrapped them in bacon and sprinkled brown sugar on top.  Delightful and easy!

I was very hesitant to make this, as I kept thinking of Break and Cream Cheese together not being very appetizing.  I decided to try it though and loved it.  I did broil the dish for a few minutes to get the bacon crispy after cooking it for the alloted time.  I will definitely make this again :)

Very simple recipe, which is nice.  Tasty (can't go wrong with bacon!) but maybe could use a little more flavor like using flavored cream cheese or adding something to it.

I made these for coworkes...they were gone by 9am. I used crescent rolls instead of bread. The rolls will require a little more cream cheese and maybe a whole slice of bacon. But I've learned for next time, and there will be a next time. Great recipe!

Many, many stars!  My family inhaled these bacon roll ups!  When you think about it, it doesn't seem like the ingredients would work.  But, it does and its fantastic.  I added a little garlic powder and salt, shreddard cheddar and chives to my cream cheese.  Then, on half of the bread, I spread on the cream cheese mixture, rolled it up, then sprinkled brown sugar on my bacon and wrapped it around the bread and secured w/a toothpick.  I'm not sure if it was the type of bacon I used but mine did drip.  I will definitely use a broiler pan next time b/c it made a mess in my oven and we had to open windows from the smoke, lol.  Totally worth it though and I'll be making these again!

I made these for a summer family party. Everyone loved them! I did use cream cheese with veggies it being summer and all. I'm going to a Luau Party next week and I'm going to try these with Pineapple Cream Cheese. I think it will be a big hit!!! Thanks for the recipe.

These were awesome & sooo easy to make. I used deli rye and Philadelphia chive & onion cream cheese and they were addictive! I did turn the heat up to 400 toward the end of baking so that the bread and the bacon got pretty crispy and I thought they were perfect. My picky husband and 14-year old daughter loved them too.

I changed this recipe just a bit...I use whipped cream with chive and mix in a 1/4 t of garlic powder, then I make as directed.  Never any leftovers when I make them for gatherings.

These were very good! I used maple hickory smoked bacon and veggie cream cheese. I pre-cooked the bacon on a broiler pan while I was preparing the bread to save time and then rolled the bacon up with the bread and baked until it was done. Everyone loved them!

VERY GOOD!  I didn't want to cut the crusts off a whole loaf of bread, so I left them on.  This gave them extra crunchiness.  I also added dry ranch to the cream cheese, for a little kick.  I baked them on a broiler pan, so all the grease drained to the bottom.  I also like to vari broil them for a couple of minutes at the end of baking to get the bacon really crispy!  We've tried them both warm and cold, room temprature gets the most votes!  I have made this recipe at least 6 times in the past month, EVERYONE loves them.  Great finger food for the office!  KEEPER!

I thought this recipe was good, however, I used the onion and chive cream cheese which I did not particularly care for.  I would have used the garlic cream cheese, but could not find any anywhere.  I also used a thicker bread, which helped when spreading the cream cheese.  I served these this past weekend at my christmas party, and I got tons of compliments, and a clean plate.  Next time I may try the plain cream cheese simply for me.  Everyone loved them!

These are a good start, however I felt they needed somethnig-  they were a little bland.  I experimented and had success with two additions:  On one batch I spread about a teaspoon of Harry and David's pepper relish on each peice of white bread with the cream cheese before rolling them up.  It added a nice little bit of sweetness and peppery flavor, which was nice.  I brought them to a party and everyone loved them at at multiple peices.  Then, I  also did another batch, and sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on the outside of the bacon rolls and then rolled them in a little brown sugar.  Again, the added ingedients gave the roll-ups a more balance flavor.  Thank you for the original recipe.  I will make them again, with my suggested additions.

These were the first appetizers to go the first time I served them at a party.  They were so easy to make and the cream cheese can probably be substituted with another type of cheese or spread.

I can't believe that I found this recipe here.  My mother-in-law made this at a party while I was dating my husband about 25 years ago.  I made this for an office party and they couldn't get enough.  I have been known to make them for dinner.  Talk about comfort food.  This is sooo good as is but I have played around with it and added pesto to the cream cheese and even sun dried tomatoes.  I get asked to make these all the time and every time I have to buy 2 - 3 loafs of bread.

These little things were amazingly good! I made these last night for a party and they were the FIRST thing to go. They were seriously gone within 5-6 minutes. I was wishing I would have doubled the batch. I think having flavored cream cheese would be excellent as well. Now I am hungry for more. Thanks!

These were amazing!  I made them Yesterday for an appetizer and My husband and I ate the whole thing in minutes!!! they are extremely easy  & quick to make. I cooked the bacon first then rolled them up and put them in the oven that way it only had to be in the over for 5 minutes till the cream cheese melts and till the bread browns/toasts. BUT AMAZING I deff recomend it! Thank YOU

MMMMMMMM! So simple and so good! I love this because there is no measuring...you can make as many or as little as you like. Just be sure the cream cheese is soft and the bread isn't 'baked that day' fresh where it will tear when you spread the cream cheese on it!

I hate to be disrespectful because I do appreciate every recipe on this site but these are horrific.  The concept was a good one but the taste is awful.  It was like eating bacon with lard.  I tried everything to jazz them up but for some reason the cream cheese just wouldn't pop with taste.  So warning to those making these.  If you can come up with a way to get rid of that bland greasy taste please let us know.  Otherwise stay away from these.  I was a bit embarrassed at the reviews I got with these.

Very good. I pre-cooked the bacon somewhat to release some of the fat and they turned out well.

My family and friends love this recipe. So do I, it couldn't be easier. The only difference is that I use onion and chive cream cheese (like some of the other reviewers) and flip them after the first fifteen minutes of cooking, then cook until the bacon is browned nicely. Always a hit at our house!

I made these on the day after Thanksgiving with my younger sister as a break from turkey! They were great! We added garlic powder & pepper to the cream cheese, which was just enough. They are a fast and delicious recipe. I plan to make them again on Christmas Eve.

I love this recipe, what an easy thing to make, it is always the first to go at my parties so I now know to make double!  I have also started to make other kinds without the bacon, asparagus, onion, pineapple, salmon the list could go on, thanks for this great treat, looks good, tastes good and everybody loves it....what more could you ask for and also it's not expensive.  Thank you xx

I do not eat pork, so i made these with turkey bacon. i would imagine the extra grease in regular bacon would make these better. i read the other reviews, and decided to add 1/8 tsp. prepared minced garlic and a sprinkle of onion salt on each cream cheese section before rolling in bacon. the boyfriend loved it. thanks for the recipe.

I was making a lot of these for a get together so I decided to cook a few for us to taste before I assembled them all.  I thought they lacked flavor except for the bacon, so I added some garlic powder, a little cayenne, and some green onions (green part only) to the cream cheese and we thought they were much better.

I find rolling the bread flat with a rolling pin helps with rolling the bread tightly. Used rondel garlic and herb for the cream cheese. Left bread slice whole and wrapped with one slice of bacon. Freeze for about 30 min then slice into thirds. Delicious!!!

My mother-in-law shared this recipe with me.  These are absolutely delicious - you wouldn't think that bacon, bread, and cream cheese would be anything to "write home about", and yet they are devoured every time I make them. Party guests request them.  They really don't need any doctoring… the bacon and bread crisp up, the cream cheese gets all melty and gooey…  salty, crispy, crunchy.  Yum!!!

This is a favorite treat at all my parties! I use Challah bread instead of plain white. This sweetens things up while the bacon remains savory crisp. Yum!

I won our annual culinary throwdown with these!!  I used Philadelphia chive and onion cream cheese, but that is the only thing I changed.  They disappeared at an amazing rate. Mine stayed put without toothpicks and I transferred them to my cookie cooling rack to "drip" off the excess grease.  They were crispy on the outside and gooey/chewy on the inside.  Perfect.

This is simple and looks good on a plate. I have made it several times and the kids really like it. I find it a little plain tasting. I will continue to use this recipe but I think next time I will add turkey inside roll up and add some seasonings to cream cheese.

Made these for Fathers Day...they were very good. Gone really quick! :) I used cream cheese and a little bit of sour cream mixed together with some garlic and lots of black pepper.. Brioled the bacon a lil first so they wouldnt be so greasy. Very good and easy to make.

Got some good reviews from male guests but I felt it still needed some more pizzaz. will season the cream cheese more next time and will buy better quality bacon.If your bacon is TOO fatty it's just a greasy mess.

These are awesome! I expected there to be a lot of bacon grease in the pan when I pulled it out of the oven, but there was virtually none. I thought the bread would be soaked with grease, but it wasn't. I didn't even have to blot them on paper towels before we ate them. These were excellent!

Yummy!  I used the Philadelphia cracker spreadable cream cheese pepper jack with jalapeno flavor.  They were so good!  I didn't even know that kind of cream cheese existed - I just happened upon it with the other cheeses, not with the regular cream cheese.  Definitely adds that extra kick!

I can't throw a party if I don't make these or people get very very angry. When they are cooking a crowd of people gather around the oven because they are usually gone in under 5 minutes. People will grab them straight off the baking sheet as I am trying to take them out of the oven.

Not so much. The men liked it - it's bacon after all, but the filling was needing something. I used garlic onion cream cheese to try give it a boost, but it didn't do anything.

I would have rated this more stars if I could!  It was so yummy, I made a huge batch for a small dinner party and they were gone in no time.  So easy to make, and a real crowd-pleaser.  I added some hot sauce, garlic powder, and green onions to the cream cheese, and it was delicious!

I make this every party that we have - which is usually about 80 people to serve food to, who are drinking. EVERYONE loves this recipe - and it's especially good with alcohol because it soaks some of it up. These are usually the first items on my table to go, and they are very easy to make.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this.  I changed a few things from reading others' reviews, but overall this was easy and wonderful.  I made half a batch with regular cream cheese, garlic powdwer and cracked black pepper.  The other batch I made with honey nut cream cheese and both wwent over BIG!  I will DEFINITELY make these again!  THANKS!

Pretty good. I served these to my husband and his friends during "football day" (aka Sunday) -- only thing I changed was I used maple bacon and soft-wheat bread.

Pretty good but not phenomenal.  I did half just as the recipe stated and the other half I added garlic bread seasoning on the cream cheese before I rolled them up and I definitely prefer them plain.

I have made these a few times, and I find that using maple bacon adds a nice flavor to the recipe.  I also just added maple syrup to them after I took them out of the oven, and it reminds me of stuffed french toast.  Very good!

Big hit at the party!  I made them super quick, so I didn't add any extra seasoning.  I didn't use toothpicks, they held together fine without them.

after reading all the reviews and making some recommended modifications (i added a package of hidden valley ranch seasonings) i was really disappointed.  these tasted more like bacon grease than anything else.  maybe cooking on a broiler rake so the fat can drip away would have been a good idea.

I made these tonight using garlic & herb whipped cream cheese, white bread and maple bacon.  They turned out great.  I will definitely make these again and will probably continue to play with the combination of ingredients.

This appitizer was wonderful.  I made it for my partylite candle party and they were all gone before i could get up and get to them.  I did just as the recipe says and they came out great.  Although, i would cut the cook time down, but i guess it all depends on what stove your using, anyways, this was a definite keep and will definitly make it again

I had this appetizer at a party a few years ago.  I got hooked!  It's great tasting, and simple to make.  I prefer to substitute cream of mushroom soup for the cream cheese. (I'm not a cream cheese fan!) Thanks for the posting the official recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Took advice of other readers and flattened out the bread a little by rolling with the side of a glass. (No need to use large rolling pin!) Used cream cheese and chive spread on white Pepperidge Farm bread for half of the batch and then cream cheese and jalapeño pepper spread on whole wheat for the other half. Left the toothpicks in the roll ups for the spicy ones and made a little tent sign that said "Spicy ones with toothpicks".  Funny thing - I made them for a Christmas party last night and then after they came out of the oven, I reread the invitation that said the party is next week!! So, my husband and I snacked on them all night! Delicious hot or at room temperature. Next week I'm going to dye the ends of the toothpicks red for the spicy ones and green for the onion. Will definitely double the recipe though and use garlic herb spread for a third flavor. Do keep close eye toward the end of cooking to make sure the bacon is cooked but not over cooked.

These disappeared so quickly. I was a little skeptical whether the bread would be soggy with the bacon but it turned out crispy & delish.   I did divide the cream cheese in 1/2 added chopped jalapeño in 1 half and ranch seasoning and chives in the other (for those that don't like spicy).   This will definitely be made in our home again!  Thanks for sharing

Easy to make, I used a half a packet of  ranch. (suggested by other reviews)  I didn't need to use tooth pics. Everyone loved them. I grilled them turned out perfect.   I will try other spices, it is limitless what you could try. I  Will be putting these in my rotation for BBQ appetizers.

I Love these. My mom has been making these for years. We find using thin sliced bread to be best when making these. Either use Pepperidge Farm or Brick oven breads. Philadelphia Cream cheese over store brand and doesn't really matter about the bacon, as long as it is not thick cut. Yummy. We made over 3 dozen for superbowl 51.

These were excellent! I got many complements on them. This was my first time making them (made for book club) so I stuck close the 'as written' recipe. The only thing I added to the recipe was ranch dressing dip mix to the cream cheese. Everyone asked me for the recipe and couldn't believe there were only 3 ingredients. I do have to warn you that the cook time took me a little longer than planned. Due to the size of my oven, I could only make 12/16 at a time. I had to cook each batch for 35 minutes. I ended up with 4 batches which took over 2 hours. It was definitely worth the time/effort however I didn't plan accordingly. I hope you enjoy as much as my group did.

I was so-so about these, although I can say anything wrapped in bacon is good! I did however get positive feedback at my party. I used plenty of garlic-herb cream cheese for each and made sure to bake them till crispy.

I mixed the cream cheese with shredded colby jack cheese and it added a great kick - not quite as sweet. Always a crowd pleaser!

The only change I made was I used onion and chive cream cheese. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes then broiled on high for 8 minutes to make the bacon crispy... Served this at a football party. The male guests LOVED these, female guests (myself included) didn't care for them... If you are hosting a party with mostly males, this recipe is for you.

These were so good and just a funny idea for an appetizer. Needs a pop of something, maybe try a sweet cream cheese flavor or add a layer of jam over the cream cheese, or even use sharp cheddar. You have to use Peppridge Farm THIN bread, it is perfect for this.

I made these but I added a little sugar and brown sugar to the cream cheese and mixed together. Then rolled to bacon in a mixture of sugar and brown sugar before baking! Turned out wonderful! You never have enough..bake extra

I wouldn't have believed something so simple could be so great!  But these are terrific.  Because I like a little extra spice, I'm going to try these with a little garlic powder in the cream cheese and a super thin matchstick of deseeded, deveined, and pre-sauted jalapeno pepper in each appetizer.

These was awesome.  I made this for a NASCAR Party and they were a big hit.  Gone in no time at all.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I used cream cheese and chives vice regular cream cheese.  Will definitely go in my recipe box for the future.

I made this on Sunday at a Bible study group I go to.  I am still getting compliments.   I made a variation.  Some with plain cream cheese, some with onion and chive, and also one with garden vegetable cream cheese.  The onion and chive won hands down. All were eaten.  Bacon is good with meat and seafood wrapped around it. You can't go wrong. I still had 1/2 pound bacon leftover and a few slices of bread.  My oven cooks fast.  Next time I will precook my bacon and drain it before wrapping it around the bread. My bread toasted way too fast.

I made these for company the other night and they were a big hit.  I did add a little chopped garlic and some snipped chives which was a great addition.  Will be making these again for various friends.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

These were great! I also made a vegetarian version using veggie bacon, and they turned out great!  I used wheat bread, and flattened the bread with a rolling pin before spreading the cream chz mixture on.  A great affordable appetizer.

good recipe & friends love this, quick & so so easy to prepare. i did not cut the bread but instead roll the whole slice in diagonal side looks more appealing to eat. also, just 1/3 of bacon slice for each bread.

These were easy to make, and went over good, but not great.  The flavor was really nice.  I did add some ranch to the cream cheese.  I think that putting them in the broiler to make the bacon crispy would have made a HUGE difference, as the bacon on mine was rather chewy.

These were so easy to make, and a big hit with my family on Christmas Eve.  I used whipped onion and chive cream cheese, and they were very tasty.

I made these just as the recipe calls for.  I thought they were way too bland and just not very tasty.  I would use a seasoned cream cheese and bread if I were to try these again.

I also like to test recipes before I make them for party guests!  We tried these last night and they were AWESOME!  I had some leftover Veggie Dip, which I used instead of cream cheese.  It worked fine.  I'm definitely making this recipe for our Christmas Party.  I think I'll substitute the flavored Onion & Chive whipped cream cheese.  I'm also thinking about wrapping a shrimp up in the bread!

Made these for Christmas last year.  Per several previous reviewers I did change the type of bread (used pumpernickel) and cream cheese (used scallion), but these were the first appetizer finished at the house that day.  I also pre-cooked them at home and just slightly reheated at my aunts house and they were great.  I've already been asked to make it again for this year and will be adding it to Thanksgiving as well.

These were pretty good.  They did get kind of greasy, but if you cook them long enough the bread gets crunchy from the grease.  I am not a big fan of warm cream cheese, so I was a little leery, but they were still good.  I read some more reviews after I made them and I think I will try a different cheese next time, maybe thin Velveeta or sharp cheddar slices?  This is stuff we always have around and they go together quickly!  My guests liked them a lot, but one person thought they were more of a brunch thing than an appetizer.  Still, great idea and a nice basic recipe to play with.  Good stuff!

This is a fave recipe of mine as well.  Except I use vegetable cream cheese and mix in 1 pack dry ranch mix and do a very thin layer of this on the bread.  -mm-mm  I had a batchelorette party the stripper ate them all :-)

Great recipe...I needed an appetizer for a last minute party and this hit me because we have a bunch of thick cut bacon in our freezer.  I used onion and chive cream cheese and regular old white bread.  It was a hit, now I've gotta make it for 2 other summer parties!  I didn't need the toothpicks but I guess that depends on how you roll 'em.  You won't be disappointed with these!
