This is a good recipe. The broccoli is tasty, but my husband thought there was too little sauce. The cashews tasted great with the sauce. Try toasting the cashews (375 degrees for 8-10 minutes on a cookie sheet) first.

We liked this recipe.  I did cut back on the butter (used half the recommended) but followed everything else in recipe.  I think next time I will saute the garlic in the butter  a bit before adding the remaining ingredients for the sauce.  Also, I will allow the sauce contents to boil for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a bit so that it will stick to the broccoli a bit better.  Overall, good recipe...I'll be making this again.

I couldn't believe how unbelievably fantastic this recipe turned out to be. My mom and I devoured this in less than 10 minutes. It just had the perfect flavor, the perfect amount of sweet, plus the perfect amount of tang. I asked my mom how she would rate it on a scale from 1 to 5, and her answer was... "from a broccoli lover's perspective... a 10"... and I agree with her 100%! I'm definitely making this one again!

Just made this for the first time and I will absolutely make it again!  I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter insead of the full 5 and didn't seem to miss anything.  This was so tasty and goes great with a light fish.  I made the sauce and tossed the broccoli in it before serving instead of just pouring it over.  We loved it to the last little floret!

This broccoli is sooo good. I made it twice already for a family get together and a party at work and everyone loved it. I had so many people ask for the recipe. The only change I made was adding 1 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

This was the highlight of the dinner I made tonight.  I was surprised when we all ignored our chicken in order to eat more broccoli.  I used half broccoli and half sliced onions, which was very good over rice.  I think I'll add some more vegetables next time-- bell pepper, celery, maybe carrots or water chestnuts-- and serve it over rice as a vegetarian stir-fry.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's excellent!  I used half the amount of butter called for to cut down on the fat.

Yes, yes, yes!!! Incredible hit with my family, including 3 children (11, 12 and 14). They continued to take extra helpings until it was all gone. I added a 1/2 Tbls. cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. I also simmered the garlic for a bit in the butter first to meld the flavor. Thank you so much! This is a great recipe for any day or special occasion. The cashews make it 'gourmet treat'.

Very good!  I'm glad I used unsalted cashews as the soya sauce adds plenty of saltiness to the dish.

This is fabulous!  I didnt have any cashews, and I used frozen broccoli,but it tasted wonderful.  I will use this every time I make broccoli.  I will just pretend there is not so much butter!

Loved this - what an interesting flavor!  This sauce is so delicious the cashews aren't even necessary, but do use them if you can.  I wasn't sure I'd like them but I'm glad I gave them a try because they did add character as well as another layer of flavor. Other than cooking the broccoli for a couple of minutes less than recommended, I didn't and wouldn't change a thing.

EXCELLANT RECIPE REMEMBER TO PLACE BROCOLLI IN A BOWL OF ICE WATER FOR 15 MINUTES BEFORE COOKING.  THIS STEP WILL ALLOW BROCOLLI TO RETAIN A DARK GREEN COLOR WHEN COOKING.

Wow!  An hour after dinner and we still cannot stop talking about the broccoli!  Served with shrimp & rice.  Will make this over and over again.  I did add a bit of cornstarch to thicken.  Perhaps I will cut down on the butter slightly next time too, to make it a bit less fattening.

Really tasty! I used less butter(about 1T), substituted honey for brown sugar, red pepper flakes for black, pine nuts for cashews, and balsamic vinegar for white. so basically everything but the soy sauce. Also I saut√©ed the garlic, pepper and pine nuts in the pan before adding the liquids and then let it boil a bit to burn off the vinegar. It was superb, I will be making again in the near future. I also mixed it up a bit with some cauliflower...

This was pretty good, my wife thought it was the best thing ever lol! For me it was a lot of soy sauce, maybe if the sauce was thicker it wouldn't tasted like you were drinking straight soy sauce..next time i'll thicken it up a bit but overall good change from broccoli and cheese!

This was yummy but didn't go well with my main dish.  This recipe taste like a chinese recipe so be careful selecting your main dish.  I loved the taste of this recipe and made it into a main dish the same week.  Double the brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, pepper and garlic to make more sauce, add cooked chicken and put over rice.  Makes a great stir-fry.

Made this as an additional side dish for our Christmas dinner of standing rib roast & buttered, parsley red potatoes yesterday.  It was a HUGE success.  My brother-in-law tries to pick a favorite dish each holiday and this was it.  My sister said sometimes soy sauce is overpowering.  This was NOT.  She loved it.  I used lite soy sauce.  I followed suggestions of using 3T butter then doubling the entire sauce recipe.  I sauted the garlic in the butter first, brought to boil then simmered till thick with just a little cornstarch.  The broccoli DID overcook at 7 minutes.  Next time I'll decrease the time or steam it.  This did not dampen the enthusiasm of my guests.  They LOVED it.  Thanks for making me look good.

I was really excited about this recipe. The flavor was very good, but 7 minutes was too long to boil the broccoli. I took it out after 5 minutes and it was mushy. Maybe my pieces were too small? I would definitely try it again with less steaming time.

I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter"¬Æ instead of butter and low-sodium soy sauce in place of regular soy sauce.  I added the garlic to the melted "Not Butter" and let it soften before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  The vinegar was too pronounced for our tastes.  I think the addition of a cornstarch wash to thicken the sauce so it would remain on the broccoli & let the cashew pieces adhere would be an improvement.  A little freshly grated ginger would also be a nice addition.

good stuff .. 
Steamed the broccoli and doubled up on the sauce (1/2 the butter). I let the sauce reduce while the broccoli steamed - the sauce thickened considerably on its own. 
Added toasted almonds on the second go - it was just as yummy.

Also (stored in the fridge sauce & broccoli seperately overnight) heated the next day and tossed with pasta .. fantastic.

Very good side dish and a nice change to plain ole' steamed broccoli! I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter insead of the full  1/3 cup butter called for. I followed the rest of the ingredients as directed. I cooked the broccoli until it was tender but still had a slight crunch to it, not the full 7 minutes. I also let the sauce simmer down to a glaze before pouring over the broccoli. I also toasted the cashews on a baking sheet right before adding them to the broccoli along with the sauce. A nice twist with a lovely flavors this turned out to be! I can taste the sweet, the slight "tang" and a little garlic butter all at the same time but not overpowering at all. This sauce is delicious and the cashews add a nice texture to the side dish. I love the blend of flavors and it really complemented the beef and rice dish I served tonight. Thank you for sharing this!

This was good. I found it just a touch strong on the vinegar and would have liked it if the sauce was a bit thicker to better coat the broccoli. Needed a little more garlic too :) I cooked the broccoli in the microwave to save a little time (and so I didn't have to wash another pot!) I ate this as my main dish, with a piece of crusty bread on the side. I would definitely make it again with a few little tweaks. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! Its a keeper for sure! I followed the advice of sauteeing the garlic in the butter first before adding the rest of the sauce, as well as toasting the cashews. I have also tried this with green beans and its great! Its a great base recipe for different flavours. For a calorie conscious meal, have also substituted the butter for sesame oil once....it gives a lovely Asian flavour.

Great dish.  I chose to steam instead of boil and I think I went for seven minutes.  Will cut it a little shorter next time to have it come out a little more crispy.  The sauce is fantastic.  I made the whole dish the night before and reheated the next day.  I believe the flavor was a better the second day after the broccoli absorbed more of the sauce.

This is fabulous paired with an Asian main dish, a wonderful compliment! I made an Indian curry shrimp dish, and this went perfectly with it. Delicious flavor and a nice change on regular broccoli. Would make this again!

MY NEW FAVORIT RECIPE!! I made this tonight with frozen broccoli and it was to die for! We left out the cashews due to an allergy. It made a lot of sauce  so next time I might cut it back a little but this was wounderfull! I can wait to try it on fresh green beans!! Thanks for the wonderful side dish!

What a nice change from basic broccoli!  This was really a big hit with my family, and they have already requested it again, less than a week later!  I steamed the broccoli, but made no other changes.  This dish does have a slightly Asian feel to it, so it goes well with an Asian-themed meal.  However, if you served it with almost any other kind of meal it wouldn't seem out of place.  YUM!!!  Thank you!!

Really delicious! I only had chopped walnuts and the reaction was still "next time buy more broccoli- I could have eaten a lot more of this." Next time I'll be excited to try with cashews, but otherwise keep it the same. (I did steam the broccoli instead of boil them- but it was close to the same thing, and the sauce was quite delicious.)

This is a delicious broccoli recipe, with a great combination of flavors!  I'll definitely be making this again.  I made a few small changes to the recipe: 1)I steamed the broccoli for the same amount of time, instead of boiling it, 2) I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 cup, to cut out some of the saturated fat, while keeping the rest of the sauce quantities the same, 3) I added the garlic to the melted butter and allowed it to saute for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients, and 4) by accident, I used a lot more cashews than the recipe called for (~1 cup), but the cashews add such a great crunch, that I thought the quantity was great.  Next time, I might try reducing the butter even more and using some olive oil.

My husband loved this dish! I made a few changes though to make it a tad healthier:
Olive oil instead of butter
1/2 fresh squeezed lemon instead of vinegar

It made our broccoli taste amazing! We're going to try this on chicken next!

I thought this was a really great change from the norm when it comes to broccoli.  I've made this a few times and the first I thought it was overly salty so the second time I used unsalted roasted cashews and low sodium soy sauce.  I also let the sauce simmer a little longer so it reduces and glazes the broccoli better.  YUMMY!

delicious! I only had frozen, but it worked very well. While cooking the sauce, I noticed it was thin, so simmered 2 minutes to thicken it up. I tasted the finished product and loved it, but as I like some heat, added a tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes. This is a wonderful side dish!

Wow! This is delicious - such a great variation on the usual side dish. I followed the recipe exactly. Will be making this again! I suggest serving it in a bowl or on a platter with a slight dip though, because you'll want to scoop out some more sauce!

I made the sauce, and added it to a cooked bag of frozen "stir fry" vegetable mix (broc., water chestnuts, carrots, peppers, etc.).  It was great.  The flavor was distinct and refreshing- not the heavy teriyaki type of sauces you find in stores so often.

This was so good!!  I needed a quick veggie side dish for a dinner with friends.  Everyone loved it.  I made the recipe exactly as called for, except I added 1 zucchini, 1 squash, and some onions.  I'm lazy, so I bought a bag of fresh broccoli instead of an entire head that I would have to cut up :)  Next time I want to try substituting olive oil or a lighter buttery option (eg. smart start) instead of the butter.  Also, I think this would make a great base for a stir fry - maybe add some tofu and chicken, pour it over rice ...  yummy!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  Such a change from the old brocolli w/ cheese.  If anyone has ever eaten at PF Chang's, then this sauce is similar to their Mongolian beef sauce or Chicken lettuce wrap sauce.  Very yummy.

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  We've had it three or four times and each time, it's delicious.  I did find that you could cut back on the soy sauce a little (half) without changing the taste much.  If you want to have this leftover (if you can get it away from the kids!!), do cut back on the soy sauce, otherwise the leftovers aren't as good.

Thank you for posting this!  We've enjoyed it very much!

This is the only way I will ever fix broccoli again...I also added carrots, thyme, and purchased the fresh broccoli pieces in the big bag @ the warehouse club...I steamed the veggies and then added the hot marinade with the cashews...thanks, you made me look like I was really spectacular in the kitchen...

This was better than I actually expected...I usually just like my side dishes plain, but sometimes I feel the need to change it up. I made this per the recipe, but next time might cut back a bit on the butter and reduce it a little longer. It made a nice sauce to put not only on the broccoli, but also on our teriyaki tenderloin and brown rice. Will make again.

I like butter on my broccoli - period. But I'm willing to try new things. When the Mrs. served this tonight it didn't seem like something I'd like, but the flavors ended up being subtle and quite good!

This was pretty good, but I can't give it 5 stars because there was hardly any sauce.  The sauce that was put on there drained right to the bottom and left the broccoli damp and tasteless with the cashews.  I recommend adding more sauce.

Yum-Yum-Yum!  I actually followed the directions exactly until I forgot to add the garlic!  These still turned out great!  I did not feel it was too much sauce, but we like things saucy!  Next time, though it was still tasty, I will remember the garlic!  LOL!  (But seriously - it wasn't missing it at all!)  Great easy recipe!  I will definitely be making this again!

So good and really simple. I don't think we will make broccoli any other way! I also have made the sauce with brussel sprouts which everybody besides my husband normally hates. The brussel sprouts were gobbled up faster than any other part of the meal. My four year old even loved them and has asked for them again. I add in a little extra brown sugar.

This recipe was a hit with a recent family dinner I held, and surprisingly the vegetable was the first thing gone.  I didn't have cashews on hand so I used slivered almonds and I toasted them for about 8 minutes like another reviewer suggested. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This was an amazing dish!! My 12 year old son can't stand broccoli, but he loved it with this sauce!! The only adjustment I made to this recipe was that I added the garlic to the butter while it melted so the garlic wouldn't be spicy, then added a very small amount of cornstarch at the end to thicken it. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I made this for my husband who only eats broccoli with mayo and he loved it.  Huge hit and very easy to do.  Next time Im going to try it with a touch of cornstarch so the sauce doesn't run all over the plate.  This one is a keeper! Thanks!

I really don't know what is wrong with my taste. I found that if I would have poured a bottle of soy sauce over cooked broccoli,I may have achieved the same recipe. Thanks for sharing this recipe but I still wonder how it got such a hiiigh rating? However, I did try some the next day so I think the sauce at least needs an overnight to blend the flavors and cook the broccoli the following day.

This is a favorite dish at our house.  Add chicken to the mixture and serve over egg noodles to make it a meal!

WAY too much soy sauce.  That was all I could taste.  I think next time I will only use a touch of soy sauce making it more of a butter garlic sauce.

This is the worst recipie I have tried from this site.  If I had eaten the veggies alone, it would have tasted much better than using the sauce from the recipie.  Gave everyone who ate it a stomach ache....don't know how this recipie got such a high rating.

This was Excellent! Easy to make and delicious! I used this as a side dish to accompany a roasted chicken, however I think you could easily adapt this to become a main meal with cooked chicken breast (cut into small bite-sized pieces), and served over jasmine rice. It has a nice Asian flavor to brighten any meal.

We really enjoyed this - substituted butter with coconut oil - doubled the sauce recipe so that there was enough to coat the broccoli.

YUM! This recipe was easy and delicious. I followed it almost exactly, except I did trade some of the butter for vegetable oil. I made some tofu separately to go with it and the sauce tasted great on that tool. I will make this again for sure.

I was not a fan of this at all. The combination of butter, soy sauce, and brown sugar just didn't do it for me. My wife was impartial to them, and my daughter said it was gross.

Very little flavor and that that was there took away from the broccoli flavor. Cashews added a good crunch though.

Sauce tasted good, but it was so watery, it went into all the other food. The taste was good though so I will make this again, but will add cornstarch to thicken the sauce

Made to recipe.  The broccoli absorbed the soy, and all you could taste was the soy sauce.  Will not make again.

Very, very good. I followed all directions/ingredients and the broccoli was delicious. I am not a huge vinegar fan so I will sub a mild vinegar (maybe seasoned rice vinegar) next time, but the mix of flavors is very satisfying. Thanks for sharing.

I was hoping for better. Needs to be a way to make the saucy flavor stick to the brocolli...my sauce  ended up watery on the bottom of the bowl.

Sounds odd but we used green beans instead of broccoli. It's the sauce we're really rating anyways, right?? It was delicious and a great way to use canned green beans.

I didn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce, I think the soy sauce and vinegar combination was a little too strong for me. I think if i did make this again, i would use very little of both and see how it turns out.

This was unbelievable delicious.  I felt maybe there was a little too much butter so I had to cut back a bit.  But overall it was awesome!

Excellent recipe.  I was low on soy sauce, so only used 2 tablespoons and it was perfect.  I'm really not a huge broccoli fan, but this was probably the best broccoli dish I have ever had or made.  I do agree with a couple of people that the sauce was a little thin - maybe a touch of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken just a bit to help it stick to the broccoli better.  Cashews were fantastic in this.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!!!

I made this recipe the first time for Easter.  Everyone loved it, it was a great change from the basics.  One thing I did do was I increased the brown sugar about a half a tablespoon to suite my taste.  I will make this again.

Oh my! This was delicious! I will definitely make it again. And I think when the brocolli gets drained, it would be best to try and soak up any water that would be left in the brocolli (that way, when you pour the sauce over, the sauce won't turn super watery. I also cooked the sauce a bit longer so it can thicken because I personally do not like watery sauce. Overall, this was great!!

I'm sorry but I did NOT like this recipe.    There was absolutely NO sauce at all, just brown crumbly stuff.  I had to throw it out.  This is the first recipe on this website that I have given a low rating to.  I followed the directions to the letter, only reducing the quantity for two people.  Did anyone else end up with no sauce?

This is absolutely the best sauce I have ever had. I used unsalted cashews as the soya sauce adds enough salt. The sauce can be used in so many different ways, salads, on chicken, rice, diff. veggies etc. You could also make up a couple of batches and keep it in the fridge for a few days and just reheat when needed. It is a MUST TRY....

I've made this multiple times, and everyone loves it!  I started adding a slurry of cornstarch and cold water to thicken the sauce a bit because I like it to stick to the broccoli a bit more.

Sweet and salty broccoli. This is the BEST broccoli side dish that I have made. I have made this a few times and here is what I have done differently to make this an A1 perfect recipe. Saute the garlic in the butter for a min or two before adding the other ing. Also mix 1/2 TBS. of cornstarch to 1/2 TBS  cold white wine and then add to the simmering ingredients and simmer for a few extra min and it is much thicker and sticks to the Broccoli well.

I wasn't too impressed.  I have a much better broccoli recipe which is similar but uses more vinegar, no butter (just a little olive oil), and sesmae seeds.

Wow is all I can say.  Both my girlfriend & I found this to be a great recipe.    This goes great with any meal and you can use the leftover sauce for other items.  The ONLY change I made is to use fat free better to make it more health conscious.  I haven‚Äôt even tried it w/ whole butter and it still tastes great.  I also don‚Äôt cook the broccoli as long because I tend to like it crisp.  But it is so fast and easy to make that I would suggest it to anyone.  You can‚Äôt mess this one up!

Broccoli is an absolute staple for us non-potato/rice eaters. We both fell in love with this recipe as a perfect way to jazz up regular old broccoli! 

I'd recommend to toast the cashews before - we like them even a little browned. You can also add a little cayenne for more kick or even some ginger to bring out the asian flavors. 

Thanks for the recipe!

I'm always looking for new ways to serve up broccoli - Husband loves it plain, but I get easily bored with it. The sauce needed a touch more soy and garlic, and I think next time I might add a little Hoisin for extra flavor. We loved the addition of the cashews but I think I would prefer them halved instead of chopped. I'll be making this again. Thanks!

My family enjoyed this very much.  I used almonds instead of cashews.  It was still very good.

This sauce is the best, and I would use it on all sorts of vegetable or even chicken. I used light soy sauce and margarine, added a bit more cashews and kept everything else the same. I had some leftover sauce that I saved and I'm going to eat it on some vegetables today. We ate this with the Garlic Red Potaotes recipe on this site, and it was a great dinner.

It was tasty but there ended up being way too much water.  I used fresh broccoli, drained them after cooking and measured the sauce to the T but ended up with the broccoli swimming in a soup of soy-water.  I don't know how I could get any more moisture out of the broccoli so I would add cornstarch or flour to the sauce.

This is a great recipe for perking up brocolli. I cooked the garlic in the butter a little before adding the other ingredients? I was just about to add the soy sauce when my gluten sensitive daughter walked in and noted she could not have the kikkoman's due to the wheat in it. The other ingredients were already in the pan so I just left out the soy sauce, no substitution.  No soy sauce needed, the broccoli was delicious! 
As other reviewer's have noted, seven minutes is too long to cook the broccoli.

Doubled the recipe, toasted the cashews, browned the garlic in the butter first, replaced white vinegar with rice vinegar, and added about a teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in water at the end to thicken it up. Served over warm rice and it was perfect!

Surprisingly good, I made the mistake of adding more cashews cuz we love them, but it actually took away from the flavor, and became too much w/ broccoli. I made it again the right way and it was the perfect amount of everything. A new favorite in our home.

Excellent!  We used half the butter suggested and low sodium soy sauce.  As suggested by another review we too let our soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, pepper and vinegar mixture thicken.  The mixture was then thick enough to stay on the veggies.  This was such an excellent broccoli recipe.  We will definitely be making this one again.  I think this would also be great to take to dinner parties because it reheated well.

This is absolutely fantastic and easy to do.  Doesn't really taste like broccoli so you may even get your non-broccoli eaters to try it!  Used abt 1/4 C. butter and under 1 T brown sugar the second time with the same great results!

Awesome! Used frozen broccoli b/c I found this at the last minute. Also didn't have cashews, but followed everything else exactly. Broccoli was so yummy. Will def make again. (PS: This is coming from someone who could care less about broccoli, so I'm impressed!)
Update: I have made this over & over again. I reduce the butter to make it a bit healthier, and it's still delicious! I've also used this sauce on spinach & my 2 year old loves it! Loooove this recipe!

Yummy!  I used about 2 Tb of butter and a few swirls of EVOO.  Also, I used unsalted cashews and low sodium soy sauce and thought it was fine, no extra salt needed.  For my one head of broccoli, I could have cut the sauce in half and it would have been fine.  It didn't go to waste though.  I dipped my steak in the extra sauce which was tasty.

Wow, this was a really good recipe. I didn't have cashews so I didn't get to use them but the sauce for the broccoli was delicious. I used low-sodium soy sauce and I thought the saltiness was perfect with that.

DH and DS liked this recipe, and since broccoli is a frequent visitor to our dinner table, it is nice to have a way to change it up a bit.  I used low sodium soy and unsalted cashews, and cut the butter back to two tablespoons, improving both the sodium and fat counts.

This recipe was so good. My daughter fixed it for us a few nights ago & we could of eaten more. My husband who always turns down broccoli tried it & said he liked it. Will definitely have it again.

This recipe is a keeper and a winner. I served it for Christmas dinner, it was gone before they went back for seconds. The recipe is PERFECT just the way it reads. SO easy. This is the kind of dish that will make people want to eat more broccoli. Even my 4 yr-old gobbled it up.

I felt it was too soy sauce-y as is so I added another tablespoon or two of butter.  Otherwise I thought it was quite yummy.

Very tasty recipe.  I don't know why some said it had no flavor, because the broccoli eaters at my table love it.  I used slivered almonds because I did not have cashews.  Also, I cut back on the butter a little and only used 2T of soy sauce as I was afraid of it being too salty.

We did not like those flavors on the broccoli at all. If we are looking for a salty/sour flavor we will make stir fried broccoli.

This recipe was sooo good. The best broccoli I've ever made & tasted. The changes I made were; I used shallots instead of garlic because I don't like garlic and I used less butter. It still was fantastic!

Yummy! After reading several reviews, I decided to add cornstarch to the recipe to thicken the sauce, but did not reduce the amount of butter. Next time, I will probably reduce the butter, because it gets quite juicy after it sits with the broccoli for a minute. Overall, a very tasty addition to basic broccoli. Everyone in my family loved it!

I used about 3/4 teaspoon garlic pepper and a little less soy sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Really good - fresh broccoli is the way to go, this was so filling I didn't even bother to make any rice to go with it. Thanks!

Easy and delicious!  I steamed the broccoli for 2-2:30 minutes and used toasted almonds since that's what I had, otherwise made as written.  Great flavor--will make again~soon.  Oh...I used about 3T butter as others recommended--perfect amount.

Skipped the cashews because we didn't have any on hand, but the sauce was FANTASTIC!  -it definitely kicked the broccoli up a notch.

agree with the other ratings regarding the consistency -- the flavor was fabulous, and I tried to cook it down a bit to thicken it and couldn't get it condensed much, so it was liquidy... it would have been great to have it adhere to the broccoli!

I love, LOVE this recipe. I did not have cashews on hand. I used pecan halves and it was delicious! I can't wait to try the cashews in it. Those are my favorite nuts.

This recipe is too much work for the outcome of broccoli and garlic! I simply prefer to saute' gently simmered broccoli with a little Smart Balance and lots of minced garlic.....yum!

I was tired of plain old steamed broccoli--this filled the billl for something new and tasty!  I used sliced almonds instead, and I also cut down on the butter.

great recipe! i wanted an alternative to asian style broccoli that i often make, and broccoli with butter that i also make.. it was like the best of both worlds! i just replaced the sugar with agave nectar and didn't have cashews, so used macadamia nuts- roasted like another reviewer recommended.

I made this recipe exactly as it was called except I left out the cashews... I am not a huge fan of nuts in my dinner. I think the title of this dish should be renamed to "broccoli with an Asian Zing" because that is exactly what it is. It was quite tasty; but, I probably only cook this if making an entire Asian meal.

Very tasty and easy!  I didn't have cashews so I was going to substitute almonds which I do think would be good, but then I just decided to leave them out entirely.  I think this would probably be great with caramelized nuts also!  Will make again!

Very good and so easy to make! I do think I'll cut back on the butter next time (I am trying to get rid of these last ten pounds before I reach my goal).  I did add about 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch to thicken (as other reviewers had done) and I used frozen broccoli and rice vinegar b/c I didn't have white vinegar on hand.  This was great over some brown rice and it can probably be adapted to include other vegetables (carrots, some onion, bell peppers, baby corn, etc.).  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

Yummy. I put the sauce below the steamer basket with strips of cooked beef and the steamed the broccoli on top. IT was great, but a little salty (probably the soy sauce because I added more otherwise there wouldn't have been enough sauce). And I only used 1T butter.

Super awesome!  I doubled the recipe bc I didn't trust it would be enough, but only put in 1/2 cup butter in and I noticed that I could taste the butter.  Next time I won't double it, and I'll add less butter.  Other than that definitely a keeper!!!

This was a great side dish. I expected it to be very salty b/c of the soy sauce, but using lite soy sauce and the vinegar must cut the salty taste of the soy sauce which gave this dish a mild flavor.

We liked this! In the future I think I'll simmer the sauce awhile to reduce it, so that it's a bit thicker, kind of like the sauce on the spicy green beans at PF Chang's. My husband put Sriracha on his and declared this "some good broccoli", which is a winner in my book! Thanks for sharing.

didn't have the cashews so I omitted them, but followed everything else.  Sauce was ok, a little heavy on the soy but it coated nicely without being thick.  Next time, and there will be a next time...I will decrease the soy and increase the garlic.  Thanks!

Made this several times with fresh broccoli, no cashews because I didn't have any.  It was ok but it seems the soy sauce was too strong.

Good taste, but I would prefer a "stickier" sauce.  Next time I would add a thickener and cook sauce longer. My preference only!

I made exactly as the recipe states.  This recipe is SO delish.  I'm always looking for new sidedishes and this one will go in my regular rotation.  Perfection.

wasn't too fond of this. i think the brown sugar was too much sweet. and there was too much sauce for the dish. maybe cut the whole amount in half.

This was the best broccoli dish I have ever tasted.   Wow!   Unfortunately, there are no leftovers!  I had to use frozen broccoli which i steamed and it was definitely a huge hit.42

I tried this yest and was impressed.  The sauce and cashews really went well with the broccoli.  I used frozen broccoli and it still came out tasting great.

This was very yummy.  I made it twice, once with almonds and once with cashews and we did prefer the cashews.  I served it at Christmas dinner and got lots of great feedback!

We didn't like this at all. The soy sauce flavor was overwhelming, and the sauce was too thin and pooled at the bottom instead of coating the broccoli.

This tasted good but I thought the sauce was very watery and there was a lot of it, although I did not make a lot of broccoli. I liked the flavor a lot though. I think that next time I might stir a little bit of corn starch into the soy sauce, maybe 1 tsp, before cooking it to help thicken the sauce. I would not boil it longer since the flavor might get too intense and sticky.

This was soooo yummy!!!  I could have just eaten that for dinner. I actually had a "steam in the bag" broccoli which made this even easier! I cant wait to have this for company.  Just uutstanding and I bet it would also be great on green beans.  Thanks for a great change my regular steamed broccoli!

We liked this.  I only used half the butter and then tasted it at the end to see if I should add the rest, but felt that it didn't need any more butter.  I also used low sodium Tamari Soy Sauce and the salt level seemed about right.  If I were to make this again, I would also thicken the sauce a little.

Wow...so good and easy.  The family LOVED it - said it tasted like something from the fancy asian restaurants.  ** my only advice is to follow the recipe exactly.  I added my steamed broccoli to the pan and that made the sauce get all watery.  DON'T DO THAT.  Just pour the sauce over the broccoli and serve right away.

This was so tasty. I did not have the cashews so I didnt put it in but i'm still rating it 5 stars on flavor. I did not cut back on the butter but used I cant believe its not butter to reduce the calories. Added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to give it a kick! Very good. Thanks for the post and next time i'll have to try it with the cashews.

This was scrumptous! Every one loved this, even my dad who says he doesn't like any type of nut mixed in with "real food." I wanted to make this recipe the way it was posted, so I figured that he could just pick the cashews out. Him and the rest of my family (myself included) gobbled them up so quickly that I forgot to take a picture of them. This is a wonderful recipe all the way around. It is easy to prepare, uses standard ingredients, has a beautiful table presentation, and tastes fabulous! This is going to become a regular at my house!!! Thank you so much for this recipe.

Delicious.  I made the mistake of adding a little salt, and it made it a little too salty.  The soy sauce is plenty.  Delicious!  Also, a majority of the sauce stays behind on the plate, so this would have been perfect over rice.  Yummy!!!!!

Excellent taste and super easy to make.  I made this for a small dinner party and everyone enjoyed it.  Leftovers kept well for a few days.  I do agree with some other reviewers who recommended cutting down on the butter.  1/3 cup is quite alot.  You could cut 1-2 Tbls. off and I think it would still be quite good.

This was sooo good!  Really different.  I made only minor modifications - I only used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce instead of 3, I added a little more brown sugar, and I used 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon vinegar.  I didn't want the soy sauce and vinegar to be overpowering.  I also didn't use the cashews - didn't have any.  My husband loved this as well.  I will definitely be making this again!

A-Maz-ing!!! Yum, yum, yum! Both of my kids (6 and 9) asked for seconds.... This would be awesome with beef over rice too. The sauce is to DIE for! I used Rice Vinegar instead of white (just because it's what i had in my cupboard) and it was phenomenal.

All I can say is wow!  Made this for the first time the other night and it was amazing.  I cut the butter in half to save the calories and used balsamic vinegar instead of white.  Everything else was perfect.  Can't wait to have this agian.  May try putting over some brown rice for a quick and simple dinner.

Very, very good. This dish had a wonderfully Asian flair. The sauce was so tasty that next time, I'll thicken it a bit so that it sticks to the broccoli more.

Made this for Christmas dinner in deference to my kids' desire for me to serve something besides red meat & taters. EVERYONE raved about it & I had to type up the recipe before they left. I used low sodium soy and doubled the garlic. Suggestions I incorporated: (1) doubled the sauce amount; (2) added 3 Vidalias, thinly sliced (2mm on mandoline) then gently saut√©ed in 2 T EVOO until just tender; (3) boiled sauce until it had thickened and (4) toasted cashews - if nothing else, do that!!! It was a bit watery, so next time I will take greater care to drain the broccoli before assembling the dish (I was in a rush). Definitely a 5 star keepsake / heirloom & we are so grateful it was shared.

This sauce got rave reviews! We put it on grilled salmon too.  I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken and a bit more brown sugar to sweeten it up a tad.

This recipe is now called "cashew broccoli" for me. I start with the broccoli in a pan with a little bit of water at the bottom and allow it to cook a little, then I throw everything listed in and let it simmer before adding the cashews. It turns out wonderful and delicious every time. To save calories/fat I sometimes cut back on the butter, but really you can't tell. This is a regular recipe for me now.

Served this with Thanksgiving dinner this year; it was a tasty compliment to the turkey-day staples. As is essential of any Thanksgiving recipe, it holds up well as leftovers--the garlic has a chance to really do it's magic by day two. Next time, I will thicken the sauce; it turned out pretty watery.

Great recipe - makes me wonder why I don't eat broccoli more often =) I would have to agree that there is tooooo much butter. Next time will reduce quite a bit... and let it boil longer so it thickens more. Love the cashews; but easily could substitute sliced almonds if you don't have cashews. --The soy sauce made me think "Asian" but I didn't get that at all...it would be a perfect complement to any meal.

This may be my family's favorite Allrecipes recipe. They ask for it ALL THE TIME. Tips: the more cashews, the better; drain the broccoli well before adding the sauce or else it will become watery; and MAKE EXTRA because it goes like crazy!

This was really good. I usually make the recipe as is to rate it. The only changes I made was to use a low sodium soy sauce and thickened the sauce with corn starch. This is a keeper!

Quite good.  I love broccoli and I'm always looking for ways to serve it as a sidedish (because it is so healthy and tasty).  This gives you a nice taste to the broccoli but also is a little bit wet.  I enjoy the cashew flavor mixed with the broccoli.

I've made this recipe a few times over the last few weeks, and I've come to a few conclusions: don't overcook the broccoli (I steam for 5 minutes TOPS) and don't let the broccoli sit in the "sauce." I have started pouring the sauce over the broccoli in a colander. If it sits in a serving dish, the broccoli ends up WAY too salty! With those modifications, it's a total crowd-pleaser.

This is fabulous! Even my college age son will eat broccoli fixed with this sauce. I did make a few changes to "lighten" it. I use 2 T butter, 2 T brown sugar, 2 T light soy sauce, and 2 tsp white vinegar. Everyone will love this-guaranteed!

This is pretty amazing and does well with variation. I used a Trader Joe's bag of broccoli and cauliflower so all I had to do was stick that in the microwave to steam it. I am not a big cashew person so I left them out and it was still delicious. I also didn't have white vinegar... just apple cider vinegar and it was still yummy. You could probably use lots of different vegetables with it too.

I added fresh carrot coins for more nutritional value and color. I substituted sliced almonds since I didn't have any cashews. I also decreased the amount of butter and didn't officially measure the other ingredients, and WOW delish in a pinch.

Great flavors. Like other recommendations, I reduced the butter and toasted the cashews. I would also recommend adding a tablespoon of flour or cornstarch to the butter then cooking with the the other sauce items to thicken the sauce a bit. I will probably reduce the cashew amount a bit next time to maybe 1/4 cup. This recipe seems like it would work equally well with the addition of carrots and/or celery.

This tastes like Chinese takeout, MMMM!!! Note: As others have advised, it's not necessary to use the full amount of butter called for in this recipe. Use half and you'll be just as satisfied! Also, next time I will try toasting cashews in an attempt to make a 'perfect 10' dish an '11!'

This was a nice and easy side dish. Due to high blood pressure I used lightly salted cashews and two tablespoons of worcestershire sauce in place of the three tablespoons of soy sauce. It was still a tasty dish and the sodium levels were much more acceptable.

I didn't have cashews but made it anyway; it's terrific!  Really something different to do with broccoli.  I made the sauce exactly as written.  I might try it next time with less butter, but it's a wonderful recipe as written.

I accidentally added 2x the brown sugar.. but it was still heavenly. I also left out the cashews since my 1 year old doesn't eat nuts yet. SOOO good! (the guys in my house didn't know green veggies could taste so yummy!)

This was fabulous. I made it without the cashews because I didn't have any, however it turned out great.  My son loved it and my brother waited until he ate everything else to finish the broccoli because he wanted to make it last.

This was really good.  I used olive oil instead of the butter because I like using a healthy fat when possible, and it still tasted great.  Also used seasoned vinegar instead of white vinegar and 1/8 tsp of chili-garlic paste instead of black pepper...just seemed to fit better with the recipe.  I'll make this one again!

Oh, my! This is tasty! It's the perfect combo of slight sweetness, saltiness, tang... I didn't have brown sugar, so I used white sugar and added a splash of molasses. 'Didn't have white vinegar, so I used seasoned rice vinegar. Fabulous! LOVE it!

This dish was absolutely delicious and just what i was looking for - something other than boiled broccoli.  I did find out why you need to serve it straight away as the sauce separated while i was waiting for the family to get together, but it tasted wonderful anyway.  Will definitely make this again!!

I have made this several times in the past few months, now I don't even use a recipe!

We LOVE it, even my 3 little boys.  I do thicken it a bit, but I've had one disaster with making it too thick, and lumpy.  I just use a bit of water with cornstarch mixed in and stir it into sauce, boil just a few seconds and its finished.  

Thanks so much for this great recipe!
Katy

It was OK.  I reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp, which I think is plenty.  Should have reduced the soy sauce to 1 or 2 Tbsp.

Fabulous taste.  I prefer to steam veggies rather than boil. Used only 3 Tbsp. butter and white wine vinegar.  Thickened it with ~1 Tbsp. additional vinegar mixed with 1/2 Tbsp. corn starch.  Had some additional fresh green beans on hand so added it to the broccoli. My son liked the green beans and husband liked the broccoli.  I liked both. We will definitely have this again!!

Great flavor and very quick and easy to prepare.  I steamed fresh broccoli in the microwave.  For South Beach considerations, I substituted Smart Balance for the butter, Splenda brown sugar (2 t), and low sodium soy sauce.  I'll be using this recipe again, and next time want to try balsamic vinegar.
****************************************
Update: Suggestions from SPOW, XANNI48 and ELKA pointed to stir fry.  Reduced Smart Balance (butter) to 1/4 cup.  Used 2t of arrowroot to thicken.  Stir fry reduces moisture over steaming.  Balsamic vinegar is great.  I could enjoy this several times a week!

Yum.  Cut down the amount of butter to maybe 1/4 c, and used almonds instead of walnuts.  After reading other reviews, I was worried the sauce would slip off the broccoli, so I added cornstarch.  The cornstarch stayed in small lumps, but after simmering for a while, they improved.  Perfect.  The next time I made it, I added 1 T cornstarch mixed with a little water: a mistake.  Lumps were out, but it started clumping together and came out as globs among the vegetables.  Taste was still excellent.  Thanks for this amazing recipe.  Will be using it again and again.

Totally easy and delicious recipe. I used those new microwave steam bags and this recipe took all of about 5 minutes to get it on my table. I don't care for nuts much so I omitted the cashews and just used the sauce. I also cut way back on the butter and it was still great. Thanks for sharing!

This was good.  It reminded me of a stir fry sauce.  I think the next time, I will saute the broccoli instead of steam it.  It seemed a little watery.  The flavor was delicious, though.

This was incredibly simple and tasty.  I subbed apple cider vinegar and added some arrowroot starch to thicken the sauce.  I think that pecans would work well also in place of the cashews.  Tasted great served next to  orange juice and lemon grass poached salmon over gingered rice.

I scaled the recipe to serve just two; only change I made was to use apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar.  This was a nice way to dress up steamed broccoli.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Salsiepie!

I made this dish as a part of a New Year's Eve "feast" for my hubby and I. It was fantastic! I will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation. The only thing I will do differently next time is add a little cornstarch to the sauce so it's not so runny, and sticks to the broccoli better.

Wonderful recipe! I was trying to lighten up my christmas dinner, being that I am a dietitian, so I took the butter out. You won't even know it's gone. I also used the brown sugar splenda. Saved tons of calories and was excellent. Don't add the cashews until right before serving to keep them crunchy. Will definitely keep in my recipe box and recommend to clients.

This is yummy.  Omit the butter though - you dont need it and you have so much less fat in the dish.  Making it again tonight!

I'm only giving this a 4 because the sauce wasn't thick enough to coat the broccoli and stick to it.  The taste is DEFINITELY a 5.  I'll make again but thicken the sauce before pouring it over.

I made this minus the cashews, b/c I didn't have them but still wanted a flavorful broccoli.  I will make sure I have cashews next time, I know I'm going to love it!  My little ones liked it too.

You know what the only thing wrong with this recipe was?  That I didn't make more!  It was sooooo good!  I even (purposely) overcooked the broccoli so it would be soft enough for my 12 month old boys to eat.  It was still amazing!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Excellent! My husband does not care for broccoli, and the two of us finished this off.  I made it exactly as written and it is delicious.  I'm sure it is the only way I will cook broccoli in the future.  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe for jazzing up the vegeatable super star, broccoli.  Even the veggie hating teen liked it! I cut back on the butter a bit, and next time will toast the cashews. Delicious!

Brilliant!  Everyone loved this dish--nothing was left!  Next time I'll steam the broccoli rather than boil, though--keeping it a bit more crunchy.

We were not all that struck on this dish I'm afraid.  Both my husband and I weren't expecting such an intense Asian flavour....we also both found that the flavour of the sauce overpowered both the taste of the brocolli and the cashews; we won't make this dish again.

The sauce is really tasty and my husband loves it! However, next time I would stir fry the cashew nuts first with a bit of oil in a non-stick frying pan so the nuts are crunchier.

This was the BEST broccoli recipe EVER!!!  My husband and I like broccoli but usually just steam it and add olive oil, salt, pepper, dill, and balsamic vinegar.  But this...this was ridiculously delicious.  We could not get enough of it.  I will definitely make this again.  It was a treat!

This was by FAR the best broccoli dish we have ever eaten !!!  DELICIOUS !!!  I did as several reviewers recommended and doubled the recipe for the sauce (but used half the amount of butter),  sauted the garlic in the butter beforehand, roasted the cashews in the oven on 375 degrees for 7 minutes, steamed the broccoli for 5 minutes, added 1/2 Tablespoon of corn starch to thicken sauce, and threw it all together !!!  My husband (who doesn't like broccoli) went back for seconds TWICE !!!!  Unbelievably the BEST recipe ever !!!!  I will be making this on a frequent basis !!!!! Thanks for sharing !!!

So I think the flavors in this recipe are well thought out and have amazing potential. I will make this recipe again but I will steam the broccoli to al dente. The cashews I chopped and popped in the oven to bring out their nutty flavor. Added cashews directly to broccoli as opposed to sauce. Then added sauce to cashew/broccoli mixture. My biggest problem with this recipe is boiling the broccoli created a water logged thin flavor combination‚Ä¶. So will try steaming and/or baking...

I had cauliflower on hand, not broccoli, so I used that. I steamed the cauliflower for about 9 minutes. The sauce is incredible--tart and sweet. Yum.

I absolutely love this sauce.  I am not a big fan of broccoli, therefore I wanted a sauce to enhance the flavor and make eating it tolerable.  The general consensus with the negative reviews was that it was too salty and the soy was too strong. With that information I decided to use low sodium soy sauce and only added a third of the recommended amount, all other ingredients remained the same.  It was perfect! I will definitely make this again.

Pretty excellent recipe. My husband wanted something other than "plain old broccoli," so I went looking for broccoli recipes and decided upon this one. Glad I did too! My hubby was very happy with it! We didn't have cashews, so instead I used 1/3 cup of sliced almonds that I sprinkled with kosher salt and then toasted in a pan. Everything else was as the recipe states and I think it was a success! Used this as a side to go with our pork tenderloin and roasted potatoes and we had a great meal! I'd probably make this recipe again, thanks! :)

We LOVED this recipe! Used raw, organic honey instead of brown sugar to TRY to kind of make it Paleo. It was very tasty. Thank you for this new addition to our favorite foods.

This is too funny! I went to my boyfriend's house months ago for dinner and his mom made this. I could have eaten the whole dish! She gave me the recipe, and now months later I stumbled upon the original here! I have made this countless times now, but of course I did some finagling. I've found that if you make the sauce with wayyyyy less butter (half, maybe even less) and let it sit for a little, the butter will separate to the top. You can pour that off, leaving a much thicker (and healthier!) sauce...this makes it stick much better to the broccoli, providing intense flavor in the dish. Like others, I felt the original seemed to not have enough sauce, but it is actually because of the thinness of it - it can't cling to the broccoli as well, so it winds up in the bottom of the serving dish. Also, as others mentioned, saut√©ing the garlic first gives a nice rich flavor. As written, it truly is a 5-star recipe...but with a few tweaks, it's off-the-charts good!

Flavor was good, but I also will try adding a thickener, it was too runny. Went well with the Honey Glazed Chinese chicken recipe.

Really easy and tasty dish, however I was expecting a stronger garlic flavor and was greeted with a heavy soy sauce taste. Will be reducing the soy sauce next time.

This is a fantastic recipe for someone who wants to try something new with broccoli. The only thing I didn't like about it was the cashews didn't add too much to the dish and it was a tad too buttery for me. I loved the flavor (a little goes a long way with the sauce).

I'll use this recipe over and over.  Great flavor.  Used low sodium soy sauce and lightly salted cashews.  My biggest problem will be keeping the nuts in the house.  The nut bag has gone into the freezer for the next time I make this recipe.  We really like cashews.  Thank you for posting this delicious recipe.

This was so easy to make and very tasty!  Next time I'll just steam the broccoli a little less so it's a little firmer, and I'll try the suggestion on toasting the cashews.  I loved the cashews in the recipe but they may be even better if more crunchy!!  Thanks!  Delicious and easy, and fast!

Soooo goood! I was looking for a different way to prepare broccoli... I found this fabulous recipe! I did not have the right ingredients so I had to substitue worcestershire sauce and marsala wine for the soy sauce. We loved it! 5+ rating.

Used toasted sliced almonds in place of the cashews as I'm not a fan. Delicious. My 16 month old couldn't get enough.

I've made this several times. My favorite way to prepare broccoli. I cut way back on the butter, only use a dab. You can add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce if needed.

Very good side dish. Tried it as original with broccoli, or substituted for green beans, and both work well. The sauce can seem a little runny at times, and always a bit too much, but never a complaint from anyone on how good it tastes.

My picky 3 year old chose to eat this instead of her mac & cheese tonight.  It's that good!  I steamed frozen broccoli in the bag (which was less than the suggested amount) so I had a lot of sauce on the bottom of the bowl, but I was fishing in there for every last piece of broccoli.  I did use 1/4 cup butter and substituted pecans, bc that's what I had. Delicious!

Got rave reviews from my hubby whose usual response to asking about any veggie is to say, "Yeah, not really my favorite."  He asked me to make it again. Didn't have any cashews in the house so simply omitted.

Great and easy recipe! I didn't have cashews, so I used walnuts instead. Yummy!

This is a really great side dish. I used only a little bit of low sodium soy sauce and also unsalted cashews. Very tasty, thank you.

A nice switch from plain steamed broccoli. Definite Asian tones to this dish. My family loved it.

I used baby broccoli and followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't have cashews so used sliced roasted almonds.  This recipe really made a change, from simple plain old green vegetables.  Thank you for sharing.

My family wouldn't eat this. I thought it was okay, but prefer butter and salt! This was pretty soupy too. Love broccoli, love cashews, love garlic, and butter and soy, just wasn't that crazy about this and won't be making again.

Delicious! You could almost call it "Asian broccoli". Makes a perfect summer side dish. I was thinking this sauce could really be used on other things too (asparagus, etc.)

This was delicious. I cut down the butter to 3 tablespoons per other reviewers suggestions and I didn't have cashews so I just left them out. I also added just a tad bit more brown sugar.

Ended up being too much soy sauce for the amount of broccoli I had, but I guess that's what I get for not weighing it.  Other than that, it was tasty.  I think next time I'll still reduce the soy though, as well as the sugar.

Loved it!  The one thing I did different to the recipe was steamed my broccoli instead of boiling it. My hubby said it was a keeper recipe.

Exciting new way to eat my favorite veggie!  Made it as written, with the exception of reducing butter to 3T rather than 5, and I really can't imagine it with more butter.  Will probably add a little cornstarch next time I made it based on others' reviews.

The other reviewers are right.  This had way too much butter.  Cut the butter down to a couple tablespoons, maybe, and this has potential.

I have one dyed-in-the-wool broccoli hater in my house, and I didn't have cashews.  I made the sauce according to the recipe, except with a little less pepper, and my lazy self just tossed frozen green beans and pecans right in the sauce until heated through.  Delicious!  The sauce will be very versatile with meats and other veggies, too.

Love this recipe!  I usually just microwave the veggies till they are crisp-tender.  I've made it with broccoli, green beans, and broccoli/cauliflower mix.  Green beans are my family's favorite.

This was awesome - I served it for Easter and everyone enjoyed, even my grandkiddies !  I became delirious upon getting everything to the table and forgot the cashews !  Can't wait to try it again with "all" of the ingredients !  
Thanks for the great recipe - very different from any other broccoli recipe I've used.

Amazing, one of the best side dishes ever! I did sub 2 tbsp of Olive oil for the butter and toasted almonds for the cashews. Mmm, thanks so much for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Used margarine instead and cut out the nuts, both for food allergy reasons.  Was loved by all broccoli eaters in family, but no converts.  Made twice now and will continue to grab for this recipe when don't want to eat the broccoli raw.

This was delicious. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. My husband and stepdaughter loved it (as did I). The real test will be on my broccoli-hating 14-yr-old triplets. The butter and cashews negated the health effects of the broccoli a bit, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But, wonderful!

Seriously good way to spruce up the same old broccoli. The Soy flavor was a little overpowering, but eaten with rice it cuts the flavor down just a bit and it is mouthwatering.

Made as-is and it was delicious!

My sister and mother (how should I say...?) have a more conservative taste palette than I do and, although they liked the recipe, they didn't love it enough to ask for the recipe. If you have people like that in your family, maybe just stick to the traditional cheese sauce!

This was easy to make, and my family liked it. Next time, I would cook the broccoli slightly less time, maybe 5 minutes, and use less of the sauce, as there was far too much in the bottom of the bowl. Thanks

Delicious! Revised the recipe a bit. Adding asparugus spears and sauteed chicken with the garlic in veggie oil. Then added remaining ingredients plus chili flakes for a little kick. Served with rice.

This is good but needed something to make it great. When making the sauce I added about 1 Tablespoon more butter and when it was simmering I put in 1lb. of baby sliced portobella mushrooms. Once the mushrooms were done (about 6-7 mins) I put the mushrooms and sauce over the steamed broccoli (steamed in the microwave in a covered dish in about 1/2" of water) and added the chopped cashews. It was a hit at the pot luck!

Love this dish!  I have made it many times since the first.  Try slivered almonds with it too.  You will not be dissapointed.

If there was another star available this recipe would get it.  The flavor from the sauce and the crunch of the cashews made this a must for our kitchen table again!

VERY good - I was tired of plain ole broccoli and found this and sure am glad I did! I made the recipe exactly as is, just decreased the serving size to suit my family. Even my 21 month son liked it and he's pretty darn picky. This is definitely a keeper and going into rotation at our house.

FANTASTIC!  My husband will usually tolerate broccoli, but he ate this like it was candy!  I've made this for company and they all loved it.  I like to thicken the sauce a little bit with cornstarch or flour to keep more of it on the broccoli.  Great recipe!

So yummy! We couldn't stop eating it! I used only about 3 tbsp of butter & added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit. I also used the salt & pepper flavored cashews.

The only adjustment I made to this recipe was to use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/3. Felt the vinegar flavor was overwhelming and the sauce was too thin. May play around with it more to suit my tastes.

My Lady is getting tired of the amount of veggies I'm putting in our diet but she pounced on this simple but delicious variation on steamed broccoli. I made it exactly as posted; next time I may take one others advice and use some thickener, but the flavor combination is perfect.

I made this with Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it!  I did use frozen broccoli and just microwaved it.  As suggested by some, I sauted the garlic (3 cloves, we like garlic a lot) in the butter and then added the remainder of the ingredients.  I kept all the other ingredients in the same amounts, except for doubling the cashews because we all love nuts too!  It really was excellent.

I really liked this!  My husband and kids were not as enthusiastic although they said it was good and it all was eaten. I always try to follow a recipe exactly the first time, but this time I accidentally used teriyaki instead of soy sauce (grabbed the wrong bottle) so it tasted quite a bit like take-out.

Husband LOVED it! Next time I make it I will cut back the soy sauce to 2T-just too salty for me.  I took other suggestions and cut the butter down to 3T.  Other than the saltiness, it was very good.

I would give it 3.5 stars if possible. I prepared it exactly as directed and it was good, a nice twist on the usually broccoli. The only thing though is its kinda a little too sweet and doesn't thicken quite that well (mind you, I didn't add cornstarch because I was trying to follow the recipe exactly; might be something I do next time). And it definetly requires cooking the garlic in the butter for a little while before adding the other ingredients.

Awesome. My husband told me this reminds him of the vegetables at Panda Express. That wasn't my goal when making the dish, but still very delicious nonetheless. Instead of butter, I used a vegetable oil spread with natural yogurt (Country Crock). It cut down on the amount of fat, but still tasted great. This recipe would be great on any type of steamed stir-fry vegetable.

I didn't have cashews, so I used sesame seeds for a bit of a nutty flavor.  This was so fast and easy and a nice twist on boring and simple steamed broccoli.  My man said, "This is the best broccoli I have ever had, are you going to remember how you made this?!" (since I normally experiment and don't use a recipe).  Gonna' have to save and reuse this one after that comment.  Bravo!

This was great! I steamed the broccoli and used pistachios instead of cashews cuz I had them on hand. Next time I'll try using 1/4 cup butter- I felt a little less sauce would still work well and , well, butter is fattening.... This recipe would also make a good side dish for an Asian meal.

I have now made this for three sets of guests.  All three have asked for the recipe and even when I make a whole head of broccoli for two people, we never have any leftovers!  This is so delicious.  The cashews are amazing in it.  No changes, just don't boil the broccoli too much longer than recommended or it gets too soft.  Oh, and I did reduce the vinegar by a about half a teaspoon, so the other flavors could shine. Yum!

Great!  I replaced the butter with olive oil, and I added water chestnuts.  I also, like other reviewers, thickened the sauce with corn starch.  I am going to make a full Chinese chicken with brocolli dinner using this recipe as the base for the sauce.  It really is restaurant quality.

Excellent recipe.  I went back for seconds and I hate broccoli.  I did make the following modifications (per other reviews); used half the butter, sauted the garlic in butter for a few minutes, and added a little cornstarch to thicken.

This recipe is the greatest!  My boys went from hating broccoli - oldest gagged on it a couple of summers ago and reminds his younger brother, so neither would touch it!  Unfortunately for us, my husband's favorite veggie is broccoli.  With this sauce over the broccoli and making sure I don't overcook so it's not soggy - the whole family gobbles it up!  Can't believe it - they now request broccoli!  Thank you, thank you!

yummmo!!  Family raved and it was all gone.  Only thing I recc is not cooking your broccoli for 7 minutes - for my taste it way too long and my brocolli came out way too soft.  2nd time I only cooked for about 3 minutes and it was perfect so watch your broccolli!! if it looks dark green then it's getting too soft.

This recipe is fabulous! I actually used spinach and omitted the cashews and it turned out delicious! My husband doesn't much care for spinach, but he virtually inhaled it! I too cut back on the butter. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good, but like other reviewers I would: cut butter in half, allow sauce to thicken (bring to a boil, or add cornstarch w/soy sauce before adding to butter).  Non broccoli eating husband had 2 helpings.  Definitely will make again.

pretty good.  The cashews are definitely a good combination, but don't think you need the full amount of brown sugar or butter.

Very good.  I used frozen broccoli (didn't have fresh) and used 3 T. of Smart Balance butter to cut back on fat and calories.  I served this with Baked Teriyaki Chicken (also on this site).

My boyfriend and I weren't blown away by this recipe but it was good. So I give it 4 stars because it is a GREAT way to jazz up broccoli and our dinner guests LOVED it. It was different which I loved and the recipe calls for things I would normally have on hand in the kitchen; BIG A+ for that!

I have made this a few times and it is FANTASTIC! I stumbled on this recipe while looking for a veggie side dish for a company holiday party. The first time I made this recipe (test run for the party), it was a bit saucy and you could taste the soy sauce which is salty. Now, I just add a bit more broccoli which I steam in the microwave in one of those steam bags. It was very easy to make (hardest part is cutting the broccoli) and a great short cut is frozen broccoli. It was a big hit at the holiday party and everyone asked for the recipe.

Awesome dish! Used Broccolini instead of Broccoli and the results were still fantastic. Had a couple of friends over for dinner that raved about the sauce!

A delicious change to everyday vegetables. I can‚Äôt wait to try it on several other dishes. I couldn‚Äôt find any cashews in the house so I tossed in peanuts and it worked.

EXCELLENT. The ONLY change I made was to add more cashews (I just eyeballed what I thought my friends and family would like). Otherwise I made exactly as the recipe states and I got RAVE reviews!! I will most definitely make this again.

Great Recipe.  However, instead of butter i used olive oil and did a little saute with the garlic to bring out the flavor and its a lot healthier.  Oddly enough it does not come out greasy at all.  I made two separate dishes.  One with the standard recipe and the other with the olive oil and they're both very flavorful from what i gather. However, i added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar to my recipe and it gives it a little kick. All in all its a great idea and side dish that can be served with almost anything.

Hrm. We didn't like this recipe at all. The broccoli seemd like it would be good, but ultimately all the sauce  was too strong/took away from the taste of the broccoli. The flavors didn't mix for us.

This recipe deserves every single 5 star rating it has.  Even people who don't like vegetables will come back for seconds of this.  The only thing I did differently was to decrease the butter and sugar.  Will make again.

yum! yum! yum!  so good, with our abundance of garden broccoli, this was a fun way to change the taste around a bit.  we went heavy on the garlic (love it) and a little lighter on the sugar.  it was fantastic! thanks!

I ended up having to add some carrots to this because I didn't have enough broccoli.  Oh my GOSH is this stuff GOOD!!!!!  I want to make it as a stir fry with small pieces of chicken and water chestnuts next time!  I made the sauce as directed, except for adding the garlic to the butter while it was melting (just changing order, not ingredients).  This is another "standard" on our family menu now :)

This was pretty good and was sooo easy to make. I didn't have white vinegar and substituted it with cider vinegar. I think that most, if not all, ingredients in this recipe should already be in almost everyone's cupboards. This time all the ingredients were already stocked at my home. I would definitely make this again.

In addition to my first review, I just have to say that my 22 month old daughter, who grew weary of plain broccoli and refused to eat it, gobbled this up and asked for more 3 times! That to me is a sign of a fantastic recipe because she's super picky. I can't wait to make this again. It's SO amazing!

This recipe was so easy and I was at first a little scared of the odd mixture of ingrediants, but it was a hit in my house.  It was so easy and quick that I actually had it done way too early, before the main dish.  It still was good after sitting a while and I did use frozen broccoli and it worked great!

After boiling the broccoli, I mixed the other ingredients in a bowl, added cornstarch to the bowl, put the broccoli in a skillet over medium high heat and added the sauce. I doubled the sauce, but unfortunately used too much butter.

This was a HUGE hit!  Delicious!  Filled the house with an asian cuisine aroma and reminded me of and entree from PF Changs.  I'm going to try mixing in some cut up chicken and adding some steamed rice on the side next time.  So yummy, and so easy to make!  You have to try it!

Double the sauce and cashews, serve over brown rice with grilled/baked chicken for a complete one-bowl meal.  So good and easy to make.  Reminds me of a dish I had at PF Changs.  I did have to add a few more tbsp. of brown sugar to take away from the overpowering saltiness from the soy.  Next time I will use low-sodium soy for a less salty taste.  My kids even liked this and my husband and I loved it for a new way to get more broccoli into our diet.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

Very good!  Made exactly as stated.  Hubby and son liked this quite a bit and asked that I make it again.  I doubled the sauce and poured half over some boneless chicken breasts I sauted on the stove.  Served with brown rice.

Unbelievably good.  I wish I would have made double the recipe, but I'll just have to make them again sometime soon. Highly recommended.

My son, who smothers everything green on his plate with cheese sauce on Thanksgiving, said these tasted too good without it! There were many more compliments on these but that topped them all. This will be on the Thanksgiving menu from now on.

Would you recommend this recipe as a side dish for ANY main course? or would it be best with an Asian meal? The Soy sauce is making me wonder.

Amazing! This was so good! I took others' advice and made double the sauce to give the broccoli more flavor. I also added the cashews into the sauce while it was still sizzling in the skillet to soften them a little more (I was afraid they would be too crunchy for the broccoli). The sauce is seriously amazing, and I would consider putting this on all types of veggies: green beans, zucchini, carrots, etc.

I had to add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  The recipe also needed extra dressing, so I will double that the next time.  Very good.  I tried using leftover salted peanuts.

Delicious! I only used 2T butter and substituted chopped walnuts for the cashews. I used lite soy sauce and frozen broccoli. I also added about 1 tsp of freshly grated ginger. Next time I plan to try this with cider or balsamic vinegar instead of white. The broccoli had a ton of flavor.

This honestly wasnt great. Didnt have all ingrediants on hand so that may be why. Used 1 tblespn white sugar instead of brown, no cashews and minced garlic. Plus I added a little cayenne pepper. Just didnt enjoy at all. The soy sauce/butter mixture wasnt a pleaser either. :-(

This was so tasty we had it two nights in a row!  I served it with white rice and grilled ahi.  It was our best meal this month!  I did add another teaspoon of brown sugar to offset the soy and it came out perfect.  I also subsituted the cashews with walnuts since I didn't have any on hand.  I served the sauce on the side since it will make the broccoli saugy if left soaking too long & everyone can add as much as they'd like! It was so easy and tasty!

This was just ok for me, the hubby really seemed to like it. I would suggest adding a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce so it coats better, ours just seemed to sit on the bottom of the plate.

Oh my goodness! This is the best broccoli recipie that i have ever made. It was a huge hit at a dinner party, and it is so easy to make. I also made it with LaChoy teryaki because i didn't have soy sauce, and it was fantastic.

I helped my sister make this dish at her dinner party and it came out wonderful.  Incredibly flavorful.  I will definitely be using this one again.  The only thing we changed was adding two tablespoons of vinegar instead of teaspoons and it was only by accident that we did so.  It was still amazing though. I highly recommend this dish.

Wonderful!  I knew I would love this recipe because I love broccoli and I love cashews.  I used frozen broccoli, but that was really the only change I made.  I made sure to use unsalted butter, because the cashews and soy sauce are salty enough.  My hubby, who isn't the biggest fan of broccoli, said, "Mmmmmm, cashews make broccoli better!"

Amazing sauce that could be used for a variety of different vegetables.  Four stars since I have a personal affinity against cashews (I used toasted pinenuts), but likely a 5 star recipe for those of you who love cashews.  Yummy!  Will definitely make again.

Delicious.  My family loved this and we would really recommend it!  Made with fresh broccoli, tasted amazing!  I almost substituted walnuts, but found I had cashews, and the taste was so well matched, I'll never think to stray again!

Loved it!  I used every BIT of the butter called for--is there such a thing as too much?  I did saute the garlic in the melted butter before adding the other ingredients, however. I was out of white vinegar so substituted apple cider vinegar... no big deal.. I'm not really on the vinegar party bus anyway.  I let the mixture boil for about 3 minutes to thicken and then added the cashews.  It was wonderful.  I had to nuke the brocolli in the microwave to get it reheated, though... just bad timing on my part trying to get the consistence to  my liking.  The family loved it, and it was a VERY nice change!

This is extremely delicious and everyone loved it, including the kids.  The amount of butter is a little worrisome in terms of saturated fats so next time I may try half butter, half olive oil or just sesame seed oil.  It is quite salty too so I could see using unsalted cashews in the future as well.

This is the first review I've done and had to do it for this recipe. I loved this broccoli and so did my husband and son. I don't like broccoli cooked, but my husband does and I never cook it for him. When I found this recipe I thought that I would try it. I'm so glad that I did, we loved it so much that I will make it at least once a week.

Yum! I steamed the broccoli and added it, along with carrots, mushrooms and onions, directly to the saute pan with the sauce. Served it over rice and my husband says it's a keeper!

OMG!  My 4yr old who hasn't eaten veggies since he was 6 months old scarfed down a full serving, then asked for seconds THEN asked for thirds!  He looks at me with a huge smile and says "Mommy I love broccoli now!"  I haven't even eaten yet but had to run back to the computer and give 5 stars!  Anything that made my picky 4 year old say he LOVES broccoli is amazing.  A million thank yous for this recipe!

Everything tasted great, except for the broccoli.  I was trying to introduce broccoli to my palate (once again) but this still hasn't convinced me.....although the sauce had a great taste!  I will try it over other vegetables, thanks.

Very good flavor.  My daughter didn't like the cashews.  I'd have to make it with them on the side next time.

This is truly an amazing recipe. It is so fast and easy and delicious. Everyone in my family loved it. It was the perfect side dish to my stuffed pork chops. Make sure to cook the broccoli for the correct amount of time. This dish tastes best if the broccoli is not overcooked or undercooked

The best clue as to how delicious this recipe is...my 14 year old boy inhaled the first serving and within seconds asked for seconds! Even my extremely picky 10 year old was able to choke it down.

VERY VERY good - steamed my broccoli  - but made sauce exactly as written.  Hubby thought the sauce was overpowering and "nothing miraculous" (his words - LOL) compared to other recipes I've made. No complaints from anybody otherwise - should have made more because everybody wanted seconds. Will likely make again and try this sauce with other veggies!

Great tasting!! I too, cut back on the butter and added garlic to cook a little. Instead of the vinegar, I added Marsala Wine. Did not thicken, as we had garlic mashed potatoes and they soaked up all the extra liquid!

This sauce was pretty tasty and the cashews added a nice texture. I reduced the butter by more than half and added a 1/4 tsp more of brown sugar.

We loved the flavor of the sauce!!  I only used 1/4 c. butter and that was plenty. I also substituted toasted slivered almonds in place of the cashews. I was a little disappointed that when I poured the sauce over the broccoli I ended up with lots of watery sauce in the bottom of the bowl and not much on the broccoli.  Next time I will toss the cooked broccoli into the skillet with the sauce at the end to cook off any water that is trapped in the broccoli heads (or I may try steaming the broccoli instead of boiling it).

So easy and fast and delicious. My 20-month-old ate and ate and ate this stuff up :) I had all four burners going with other items so I put all the ingredients (except the cashews) for the sauce into the microwave and did it that way.  Also used steam-microwave broccoli b/c I didn't have time to do fresh and it was all still perfect. Double yum!

I didn't have any cashews when I made this and I had a lot less soy sauce then I realized (only about 1 TB).  Still, the flavor was good and I received a lot of compliments.  I think next time I will try it with the right about of soy sauce and cashews.  It was a fun, new way to make broccoli.

Delicious! This one was sitting in my recipe box for over two years, and now that I've tried it I'll be making it often.  I'm not a big soy sauce fan, so used about half the amount and reduced sodium soy at that, and the flavor was excellent! The sauce is runny, but I rather liked it that way on my crisp-tender broccoli (I steamed mine in a steamer).  I suppose if you wanted to thicken the sauce you could whisk in some corn starch, but I prefer it as stated - having the sauce as an accent instead of drowning the broccoli in it.  Great recipe! Well worth the wait! ;)

Made this for my family for dinner, and it was a big hit!  My broccoli got a bit mushy when I had to wait for a late arrival before serving, but still tasted good!  I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, and sorghum molasses rather than brown sugar, and it was delicious!  It had a great oriental kind of taste, and a nice crunch from the cashews.  The sauce tended to pool in the bottom of the bowl, so make sure to dip deep to get enough sauce on your plate!  Broccoli is a favorite vegetable in my family, so will definitely keep and make again!

THIS WAS A GREAT & EASY WAY TO GET OUR SON (17) TO EAT HIS VEGGIES. HE GOBBLED IT UP. THE ONLY THINGS I CHANGED WAS I MICRO THE BROCCOLI FIRST INSTEAD OF STOVE TOP & LEFT OUT THE CASHEWS (MY GUYS DON'T LIKE NUTS IN THEIR FOOD), OTHERWISE STUCK TO THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN. IT IS DIFFENITELY A KEEPER. TKS!

This is a GREAT recipe! My husband is very health conscious and loves new recipes for his favorite veggies. It is great as is but we change a few things to better accommodate our diets.We cut down a lot on the butter and add cornstarch to thicken it instead of boiling it so it doesn't cook away nutrients. We also add chicken breasts for protein, spinach, and tonight we will add some chopped serrano peppers for a little kick. I sub walnuts for cashews since they are less fattening and have omega oils, Then serve it over fresh brown rice!

This is a great and tasty way to eat healthy! And it is so flexible!

I used frozen broccoli and the dish was excellent.  I love the sauce.  I am going to have to find some other foods I can use this sauce for.

This was very good and easy!  Even my kids ate their broccoli!  I replaced the cashews with pecans for allergy reasons but other than that made no changes and it turned out superb.  Thanks!

What an elegant way to dress up a broccoli side dish. I was giving this a test run as a possible side at Thanksgiving. It earned a thumbs up from everyone. The cashews were a tasty delight. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a dinner party and the broccoli was an amazing hit!  The flavor was just perfect!  It makes you believe that even those who don't like broccoli would still enjoy this recipe.  Loved it!

Oh-My-Gosh!!! This sauce bursts with flavor!  I only made the following changes: 1 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp soy sauce, crushed some unsalted almonds (in lieu of cashews), and increased the vinegar to 2 tbsp (by accident), and added a 1 oz flour/water thickener at the end.

Wasn't too sweet, wasn't too runny, wasn't overly tangy... it was incredible!  Before I'd even finished (and it didn't take long), my seven-year-old pulled herself away from the tv (!!!) to ask what that wonderful smell was!

I'm definately bringing this to the in-laws (whose love for *good* food can be intimidating)!

This was really tasty. I used unsalted cashews though. I would definitely toast the cashews the next time I make this.

This recipe is the best broccoli I've made!  I steamed some broccoli with portabello mushroom stems (hate wasting them when I make mushroom burgers!).  I used half of the butter called for and 1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 Worcestershire sauce because I ran out of soy.  Also, I didn't have any cashews.  The crunch would have been good, but even without, this turned out amazing!!!

Update: I just made it with cashews.  I didn't think they added too much to the recipe.  It's still a five star recipe, but especially with the price of nuts, I'm going to omit the cashews from here on out.

Oh my goodness. 350+ people aren't wrong when they say this recipe is amazing! We were in need of a recipe for a potluck and had a bunch of broccoli in our fridge that needed to be used. Not only did I eat almost half of the dish before I even got to the potluck, but what was left was devoured almost immediately. Even my most picky-eater of a friend said they were pretty good for broccoli. I am craving some now as I write this review...

DELICIOUS! I turned this into a main course by cutting the butter in half, then saut√© the garlic in the butter before adding a 1/4 c of water two chicken breasts, and the broccoli. Cover and poach for ten minutes on med heat. I sub'd almonds for cashews and served it on basmati rice - my husband and two year old picky baby boy both went for seconds!

I don't like broccoli except for maybe in a broccoli casserole smothered in cheese or bread crumbs BUT this dish was fantastic! I bought 4 heads of broccoli for 8 people thinking that there's no way one person would eat more than 1/2 a head... I was WRONG the dish was gone in a flash and I wish I'd made more. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to the sauce before boiling to thicken it up and I substituted almonds for the cashews because that's all I had. So great, I will definitely be making this again.

This is a delicious way to prepare broccoli!  I didn't make any substitutions.  I bet this would be great with the sauce doubled, and chicken or shrimp added and served over rice!  Enjoy!

This was good, I really liked the sauce, but I felt it over powered the broccoli. It was a nice change, but I don't think it was good enough to out weigh the fat & calories of the butter.

After reading the reviews, I decided to give this recipe a try.  I was surprised at how simple it was, but very very good.  I used frozen broccoli and just cooked it according to the package. The sauce was soooooo good.  I think the next time I make it, I will add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  I think it would be great on other things, like rice or chicken!  Thanks for a new way to fix broccoli!

I made this for Easter, (12 servings) and it was a huge hit. I agree with a couple other reviewers in that there was too much sauce, so next time I'd cut down the butter a bit. But overall, there were 12 very happy people with this dish.

I could eat this every night! I used it as a side dish to a meatloaf casserole that I made from leftovers, and it complemented the meal perfectly.  Of course, it's Asian flavor lends itself to complement most Chinese dishes, too, but you can do a lot more with this one!

I just didn't dig it.  I actually followed recipe amounts (rare for me) and while I was RIDDLED with butter-guilt, it didn't thicken, so it mostly splashed onto the serving platter instead of my hips.  It smelled incredible cooking (minced garlic and butter? spoon me baby!) but it didn't come together for us.  Gave it 3 stars because the taste was about a 3...... I don't think I'll try for a repeat on this one.

Very tasty, I used half the butter.  Just when the mixture was beginning to boil I mixed (separately) a couple Tbsp of water with a Tbsp of cornstarch and then added that mixture to the pan. Helped thicken it up.  I served this recipe with "Honey Baked Chicken II" from this website and brown rice, and it made for a great meal. I recommend cooking the broccoli AFTER making the sauce and for less than 7 minutes so it doesn't get mushy and still has that "tender but crisp" feeling when you bite into it.  Since I brought this dinner to a friend's house, I made the sauce first at home, put it in a gladware container, cooked the broccoli at his house, and added the sauce just before serving. Worked really well.

I made this for my boyfriend, who loves broccoli (I'm always looking for different ways to prepare it). He LOVED it. He said it's the best broccoli he's ever had in his entire life (and yes, he was actually that enthusiastic!). He couldn't stop raving about it. This is a keeper!

I love this recipe and my guess is that if you are checking out broccoli recipes you will love it too. It is great as is, but I do mix the sauce ingredients first and thicken slightly so it sticks to the florets. I prefer to steam the broccoli or boil for just a couple of minutes to insure it does not get soggy.  WARNING - the first time I used this recipe I "sampled" so much  that I ruined my appetite for dinner!

This was really good.  I think the hardest part is to avoid over-cooking the broccoli.  Once the water was boiling, mine took only about 3 MINUTES!  Just watch for the bright green color and then test for tender cripsness!  Yum!

This was good, almost the whole family liked and wants me to make it again.  Even the broccoli hater tasted it and didn't act like he was going to die.  I did decrease the soy sauce a little and I steamed the broccoli in the veggie steamer but that is the only changes a I made.

I made this last night for my husband who is NOT a big broccoli fan and he LOVED it.  It was really good and a nice change. Broccoli always needs help in my opinion so this was a nice change.

I LOVED THIS.  The only change I made was using liquid butter substitute as am really trying to watch the fats.  I made this for dinner along with a baked chicken breast.  I am sure that those not needing to watch fat intake will use butter, but the flavor did not suffer at all.  I will be making this again soon.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  I added some red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick and added corn starch to thicken up the sauce a bit.  The dish was a hit - there wasn't any left and my mom requested the recipe.  This would also be a good recipe to use as a base for stir fry.

this recipe is great!  we love to have vegetables with nuts on them because they give a little crunch so we can omit additional carbs.  this recipe worked out wonderfully.

This is a great recipe for steaming broccoli and very easy.  I didn't have any cashews so I used slivered almonds.  Turned out well.

This is a really easy and tasty vegetable side dish. My daughter even liked this recipe, and she usually hates broccoli. The only things I did differently was to saute the garlic in the butter a couple of minutes before adding other ingredients and add cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. Thank you for the recipe, SALSIEPIE!!! I will be doing this one again and again!

Wow! Served it tonight for the first time and it was a big hit! My in-laws wanted the recipe so we got online and shared! Did reduce the butter to 4 tbsp but left it as a sauce and did not use a thickener to make a 'gravy' - a very flavorful and tasty alternative. Will definitely make again!

This was great. The sauce was great with peas/rice too. I didn't have cashews so I used slivered almonds. Could have used more garlic though as it had a strong soy flavor but weak garlic taste.

The flavor of these were really good, but the sauce just sat in the puddle in the bottom of my serving bowl with all of the cashews.  Since nuts are so expensive I really wanted them incorporated into the dish.  I should have read the other reviews which advise thickening the sauce with cornstarch.  I will try this dish again, but if the sauce doesn't thicken up and stick to the brocolli I will try a new recipe!

I'm not a broccoli lover at all, but I wanted to make something healthy for the family everyone raved over it, and I couldn't stop eating it. I used the Smart Balance in place of the butter. Definatly a keeper

My husband ate 2 helpings of broccoli!  This hasn't happened in the 10 years I've known the man.  Very nice change of pace... we'll use it regularly (with a bit less butter).

I really liked the taste of this.  I could've probably gone without the butter.  To save time and cleanup, I just made the sauce stovetop, added the broccoli and cooked for a few minutes, and then I added the cashews.  Very good!

I'm not sure that the name is fitting, but the recipe tasted excellent!  I used white wine vinegar instead of plain white, and used dark brown sugar.   This really tasted fabulous and everyone (even those who don't usually eat veggies) was asking for more!

We really enjoyed this, though it started to get heavy as we continued to eat, so I might go a little lighter on the butter and more soy sauce next time.

It was SO easy to make AND delicious. I used Splenda brown sugar and "I can't believe it's not butter" and it was still great.

not impressed.
The dressing overpowered the broccoli instead of complimenting it.
It was the only food I threw out after my holiday meal

this was a very unique way to serve broccoli.  I did'nt have cashews on hand so substituted walnuts and it was a delicious marriage.  Instead of butter, I decided to go a little healthier by using smart balance light buttery spread.  In addition to it being very flavorful, it was a pretty as well.This dish is perfect for guests and family alike.

The flavors of the sauce were very tasty, but it was a bit too salty and a little runny and thin.  It wouldn't stick to the broccoli and pooled at the bottom of the serving bowl.  I followed the instructions for the recipe exactly and since we liked the flavor of the sauce I will make a few modifications 
the next time I prepare this.  First, I will use unsalted butter and low sodium Soy sauce to cut back on the saltiness.  Secondly, I think I will add some corn starch to thicken the sauce so that it sticks to the veggies and doesn't run off the veggies and pool at the bottom of the bowl.  This was a nice change from broccoli with just another cheese sauce poured over the top.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe states last night for dinner, to go along with Tilapia. It was yummy!  A nice change from regular steamed broccoli.  I agree that the sauce was a bit thin, but the taste was excellent.  Thank you!

OK.  I know everyone hates it when you review a recipe after having tweaked it, BUT it turned out really good and was WAY healthier, so I thought I'd share.  I only steamed the broc for about 2 mins, then into an ice bath and drained.  I left the butter out, subbed a splash of canola oil, a touch more sugar and vinegar and otherwise followed the recipe.  I served it cold, as a salad.  My family devoured it, it was SOOO good.

This is a wonderful way to fix broccoli!!  I served this dish at my son's graduation party and it was a smashing success.  I upscaled the recipe using 9 lbs of broccoli and there were no leftovers.

These were really good.  I would cut down on the soy sauce next time, maybe to 2 tbsp.  I steamed the broccoli for 7 minutes and it was still a little crisp which is how I like it.  Overall a very good flavor and I really like the hint of brown sugar you can taste.

This was a great broccoli side dish.  I only gave it 4 stars because I used almonds in place of cashews because i didn't have them.  It was great with almonds and would probably be better with the cashews!  Will make again and again!

I made the broccoli with the cashews the first time and then without the second.  I think the cashews take a little bit away from the broccoli...maybe peanuts would be better?  Either way, I get asked all the time to make this.

We enjoyed this dish - I used pine nuts instead of cashews. I rated this a 4 only because I found the broccoli started to get a little soggy. Overall, very good!

My husband and I love broccoli and I was looking for a way to spice it up a little. This recipe does just that. I admit that I was a little skeptical at first about the soy sauce, brown sugar, and cashews together. But we tried it and it turned out great. Even the kids loved it and usually they complain about eating veggies. I wouldn't change any of the ingredients. It was great and I will definitely be making this again!

Great, Great recipe.  I'll be making this one for many years to come.  I have a folder in my MasterCook recipe program to store recipes, and I have a "My Favorites" folder in which 1 in 200 recipes I try probably makes it in there - only the best of the best.  This one is definitely in there. Thanks

Absolutely fantastic. Added just a small amount of toasted sesame oil to the sauce. I could eat this every day it‚Äôs that good and easy. Next time I think I‚Äôll just lightly steam the broccoli in the microwave, rather than blanching on the stovetop

Made it for a company meal and everyone raved about it.  I stir fried the broccoli in a wok with a bit of chicken broth.  I made the sauce ahead of time and added 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken a bit.  Once the broccoli was crisp, I poured the sauce and cashews over the broccoli in the wok and combined.  Delicious!

Super easy to make; great flavor; I used a steam bag of frozen broccoli and it worked great.  I didn't have cashews, so I used sliced almonds.  I also used Splenda Brown Sugar to cut down a little on the sugar grams.  We will definitely have this again!

I also make it using 1 lb of broccoli and adding carrot and chicken or beef for a full stir fry style meal.

This is DELICIOUS. I added some sweet chili and ginger to give it a bit more complexity. I doubled the sauce and then turned it into a main dish by putting down a bed of rice (using coconut oil instead of butter because it gives the rice a wonderful, light coconut flavor and lovely dimension in Asian dishes) and then tossed some cut up grilled chicken thighs with the broccoli in the sauce. Spooned the sauced chicken and broccoli over the rice and served. All six of us devoured it, including my three super picky palettes. Absolutely excellent, inexpensive to make, tasty enough for company.

This was a very simple and excellent side dish.  I made the recipe exactly as directed.  The directions didn't specify the exact cooking time of the sauce, so I simmered it until it was just a little thick.  It was just perfect.

Fantastic even if the broccoli is over cooked. I subbed in coconut aminos and used a small amount of miyokos vegan butter. So glad I added the toasted cashews out. They were the best part.

Excellent!
Like many others I recommend using less butter. I used two tablespoons.

There was not enough sauce as written, so I doubled it except for the butter.

I used frozen broccoli because I don't have any fresh on hand, and apple cider vinegar because I don't have white vinegar.

Was pretty disappointed with this dish. I didn't find it to be worth the extra work, albeit not much work. I won't make it again and wish I didn't waste the money buying cashews for it.

Loved it. I    The butter adds a richness to the flavor that makes this a five star recipe.  I sprinkled the cashews over the top instead of mixing. The crunch of the cashews was a great compliment.  Will definitely make again.

As someone else commented, this definitely has an 'asian' dish flavor because of the soy sauce.   I'm not a huge fan, but my wife loved it.   I didn't do a great job draining the broccoli after cooking which thinned down the sauce a lot.   As others commented, 7 minutes gives you well cooked broccoli (which I happen to like).   Cut that back if you like it firmer.

Turned out great.  Made it a meal, by serving over brown rice.  Substituted Vegi Broth for the butter and Braggs Amino Acids for the soy sauce.

This was a nice  veggie dish. 
I adjusted it for my taste, by adding minced ginger. 
I also added balsamic vinegar and Sake, instead of white wine vinegar. 
Yummy for me...

Cheers!

I was looking for a recipe for a side dish. Paleo diet  needs variety and this was a great addition to my recipe file.  I changed things a little.  I used almonds instead of cashews. I browned them in clarified butter and garlic then put them on the side until I was ready to add them.  I had cauliflower, peppers and red onion so I added those into the dish.  NO brown sugar was added.  My family loved it.  They told me not to lose this recipe.

The consistency and flavor was quite good. Buttery and rich. I added a TBSP of cream as the food processor got stuck, as well as grated mozzarella cheese as I didn't have cream cheese. Holy garlic, though! :) I would cut the garlic in half or sautee it first. It's raw and so strong. Not a good date night dish. But healthy and tasty.

Easy and delicious.  I'll bet the sauce would be good with other vegetables, too.  I had mixed nuts on hand, so I used them instead of just cashews.

I do not really like broccoli, but my husband and son do so I made this for Christmas.  This was the best broccoli I have ever had!  I will add this recipe to my arsenal, because the men in my family LOVED it, and even I thought it was pretty tasty.

Super yum!  I didn‚Äôt have cashews so I used almond and it was delicious.  My boyfriend loved it too and he is kinda picky and was hesitant when he saw me use vinegar but after trying it, he said it was one of his favorite broccoli recipes

I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and pecans instead of cashews because they're what I had on hand. It was easy and turned out really well! Would definitely make it again.

This was good. I cooked the broccoli in a different and what I thought easier way. I bought already chopped and washed broccoli. Instead of boiling I just sauteed them in a pan and mix in all the sauce while it was pan frying. Turned out tasty and much a simpler process with only one pan to wash.

I didn't even use the cashews - did 5 tablespoons of butter and doubled the brown sugar, vinegar and soy sauce due to former comments.  Was delicious but don't even think I needed to double the sauce - will make again though.

Such a disappointment! Sauce was so thin it just moistened the broccoli, which was kinda gross. The cashews would not stick to the sauce, so those were lost to the bottom of the plate. Honest to God, I don't know what was the fuss about. Lowest rating I've left in *ages* it was that disappointing.

Nice buttery flavor.  I toasted the cashews and used rice wine vinegar and frozen broccoli.  Needs to be eaten right away or the sauce gets watery once it is poured on the broccoli.

Outstanding!  The wife and I both loved this recipe. Turns broccoli into  something that actually tastes good and is not a chore to eat.  I made the recipe as is but next time I might try using reduced sodium soy sauce and maybe unsalted cashews just to cut the amount of salt.

Very good for something different--easy to make and may make again.  The cashews really made it unusual.  But the best and easiest way to eat broccoli is to steam it and simply add a little melted butter and salt.

Loved this! I reduced the butter to 3 Tbsp. on the good advice of other reviewers. I was out of cashews and substituted sliced almonds, which worked fine because, frankly, this sauce is so scrumptious, it'd probably make cardboard taste good. I will definitely buy some cashews for next time, tho, because there's no doubt that'd taste fantastic. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was an excellent side dish on Christmas. I prepped the sauce and chopped the broccoli ahead of time. It was easy to put it all together and serve hot during party time. I received many compliments and will definitely make again. No changes needed.

Three broccoli haters loved it.  It is the only way I make broccoli now.  I took the reco of adding cornstarch to make the sauce a bit thicker.  I used roasted cashews, but unsalted. We were all good with it.  I have made it a couple of times now.  I boil water, add in the broccoli but only for a minute.  We like it crispy.  I also spread out the broccoli, and drop cashews all over it - we like a lot of them and then pour the sauce over top. Delish!  Thanks for this recipe.

The recipe was good, but I felt the sauce overpowered the broccoli, rather than enhanced it's flavor.  We like broccoli with just a little butter, so I probably won't make this recipe again, but if I do, I will reduce the sauce by half, and simmer it to make it thicker, so it will coat the broccoli, rather than pooling at the bottom of the dish.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks for the recipe - I love trying new recipes, this one just wasn't for us.

Husband on Paleo but not stringent about it.  Therefore only put in a pinch of brown sugar.  After making the recipe and constant tasting, I too added a splash of red wine balsamic vinegar and a healthy squeeze of lemon juice.  I too added some baking powder but must not have been much because I didn't notice it being very thickened.  While waiting for the broccoli to finish steaming I got the idea to add Trader Joe's Sun Dried Tomatoes to the sauce.  They really MADE the sauce in our opinion.  Tossed the broccoli in it.  He raved about the veggies and said it is his new favorite.   Thanks for the recipe!

Really great super tasty. I toasted the We cashews in the oven for a little. And you have to drain your broccoli really well or let it sit a bit after cooking because it retains so much water and will make your sauce watery.

The taste is very good. I do like to keep an eye on the broccoli though and stop cooking while it is still firm.

Broccoli is one of those veggies I like but never really crave, but the sweet salty sauce and the texture combination of broccoli with cashews really puts this one the wow list.

This is a side dish on Thanksgiving. I‚Äôve made it every year since 2012 and several times in between. Steaming the broccoli instead of boiling it keeps it crisper. I‚Äôm going to toast the cashews like someone else recommended.

The reason I am scoring this 4 instead of 5 stars is that I altered the recipe the 1 time I have made it.

I doubled the amount of cashew's,  added about a Tablespoon of honey, ( it tasted like it could use a little more sweet on top of the brown sugar), and about tripled the garlic,  (I like garlic).  I also took the advice of several reviewers and thickened some with corn starch.  

Next time I may go by the recipe to learn whether I helped or hurt the recipe this time.

I questioned the 1 1/2 LB's of broccoli and used only a little over 1 pound.  I think that this was about the right ratio of sauce to Brocc.

Very simple and tasty...even those that say they don't like broccoli come back for more. Nice with all meats as a serve or side dish.....and the only time I had some left over I enjoyed it next day with my salad. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This was really good and gave another twist to serving broccoli. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I did have to substitute slivered almonds since I did not have cashews on hand and they worked just as well, but quite frankly, I don't think that nuts are necessarily needed. It tasted really good with the sauce. I would make this again.

The flavor of the sauce is very good with the broccoli. I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, I overcooked the broccoli and it was mushy....sauce was still good. I will make again this time with more care and steaming my broccoli instead of boiling.

This was good, but I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't cook the broccoli as long as directed.  4-5 mins was plenty!  I loved the taste of the sauce and I did make a double batch but I ruined it thickening with corn starch like other reviewers had done.  Just skip it and reduce the sauce for some thickness.  It wasn't my favorite way to cook broccoli but would make a nice side dish with an Asian flare meal.

This is an amazing recipe!  The flavor of the garlic butter is addictive, I think I may double the recipe next time I make it.  I loved the crunch of the cashews with the soft crunch of the broccoli.

This was delicious! I'll definitely make this again, but I'll probably use a tablespoon less soy sauce next time. It was pretty quick and simple, and my husband liked it too.

It was a little too sweet for me but my husband loved it. I served it over soft fried noodles. I would make it again with a little less sugar.

Excellent.  I thickened the sauce with a little water and cornstarch.  Also I didn't have cashews and substituted macadamia nuts instead.  All the grandkids loved it.  Thanks Salsiepie.

It was pretty good, but didn't keep the zesty flavor very long. I used frozen broccoli- following the instructions on the package to warm it up- and just skipped the first step. The broccoli was very good the first and second day, even after refrigeration. However, the third day the sauce had just lumped together and the broccoli had soaked some up, making it chewy. Long story short: eat this up when first cooked!

My family loves this side. We can't get enough. I do Toast the cashews in the butter a bit before I add anything else. Keeps them crunchy and adds a bit more depth of flavor.

When I followed the recipe exactly, the soy sauce and vinegar were overpowering. So I made it again, this time with less than half of the soy sauce, no vinegar, and I let the garlic cook in the butter before adding the rest. It was delicious, my guests loved it too.

We return to this recipe in particular time after time. We coupled up with another Allrecipes great: garlic chicken. That plus Allrecipes roasted potatoes? Makes for a great fall near him.

This is a really nice alternative to plain steamed broccoli as a side dish. My son's girlfriend does not like broccoli, but liked this version well enough that she asked to take the leftovers home. 

I found the sauce very tasty, but perhaps a bit buttery. I don't usually cook with a lot of fat, so this is probably just a matter of personal taste. The next time I make this dish, I will use about half the butter and perhaps a bit of chicken broth to make up the lost volume. 

I did use more cashews than recommended, but knowing how my family likes them, I figured it was better to have lots and avoid the "he got more than me" arguments. 

I'll definitely be adding this to my regular rotation of recipes.

This is so good.  It can be a meal in itself.  I paired it with smothered steak and nothing more was needed.  Since I don't eat sugar, I added Stevia to the sauce after it was cooked and it still tasted great.

This was really easy and really yummy. You could even throw some chicken, beef, or tofu into this for a quick one pot meal.  I only had frozen broccoli which turned out fine. Fresh is the best option though.

Delicious with a few of the other reviewer's modifications: steam broc for 8 minutes so  not overly mushy; chop then toast cashews in oven 375 for 8 minutes; add garlic to butter sauce first, let it cook a few minutes then add small dash vinegar, pinch brown sugar, 3 Tbs soy sauce, pepper, toasted cashews. Let the sauce boil and thicken then pour over broccoli

Our pediatrician recommended that the kids eat more broccoli--the "super  food". I told him it was a hard sell. I made this recipe without the cashews bc thought kids would pick them out and they loved it!  The next time we went to the grocery store my 8 year old wAndered off in produce and came back with 2 bundles of broccoli to put in the cart. Delicious!!!!

This is pretty much the recipe I make for beef and broccoli.   Same ingredients with or without the cashews.   I do like this. Someone may want to add stir-fried chicken or beef.  If you like extra "gravy" just double or triple the recipe-less the broccoli.   That's the nice thing about stir fry it's how you like it.

I made it with a 50/50 mix avocado oil spread and EVOO.   There was enough sauce.  I steamed the broccoli, need to have the heat up high to get the broccoli hot enough to cook when suspended in steamer.  This would be a crowd pleaser so I would serve it at a family gathering.  One can do all the prep a day in advance then cook broccoli and sauce before serving.

One of my most-requested dishes at all "ladies lunches" - everyone loves it!  Really easy and so delicious - I've probably shared this recipe more often than any other I have.

Soooo good! I used frozen broccoli florets and without the cashews since that's all I had on hand. This is the only way I want to eat broccoli now.

Just made this dish and the flavor was intense. This will go well with brown rice and boneless chicken.

This was great! I will admit I cheated a bit and used a steam bag broccoli vegetable medley. I did this sauce though minus the cashews and it was amazing! I added some red pepper flakes. Next time, as others said, I'll boil the sauce a little more so it's thicker.

I thought this was a nice way to change from the monotony of having steamed broccoli. I liked the flavor of the sauce and the texture that the cashews bring, but it felt like something was missing.

Really good! I  use less butter with great results, like most reviewers say. I've never added the vinegar, just doesn't sound good to me.  I've made this many times and will continue! Great recipe for a crowd!

I used frozen broccoli and watched  to be sure it didn't  go past green and tender.   Mixed ingredients exactly.  Very good, my family of 5 all enjoyed it (mom, dad and 16, 13 & 6 yo kiddos).  Only change i'll make in future is to reduce sugar by 1 teaspoon.  It was a smidge too sweet for our taste buds.

I used this sauce on sauteed broccoli rabe & bok choy - it was fabulous!  Served it with Grilled Salmon Kyoto also from this site on top of Jasmine rice.  It's a delicious, versatile sauce that will be a staple for us....thank you!

Toasted the cashews in oven at 375 8 min, too long, definitely added to flavor. .   Saut√©ed garlic in the butter for a few minutes also.   Every one LOVED it!  Comments were it was a nice change for broccoli.

This was very tasty. I have a nut allergy so substituted sunflower seeds for the cashews. I followed the recipe other than that substitution.

Really good! If you think you will have leftover do not add all the cashews at once. They will not be crunchy when you reheat it. I had a ton of extra sauce but we ate with roast chicken so it was like a thin gravy underneath- YUM! Also, I made for New Year's but will try to make with at least half the butter to see if it can be used for regular dinners.

Very good. I had to hold  the sauce for a long time and it clumped up when I added cornstarch. I also did not saut√© the garlic in butter which I will do next time. The sauce would be good over chicken with rice too.

I'm always looking for good vegetable recipes as I'm more of a meat and potatoes person, but need to eat a more balanced diet. This one definitely fits the bill! 
I always read reviews to see what people think, changes they made, etc. That said, I did add a bit more butter and corn starch to thicken it and yield more sauce. My husband doesn't like nuts with his veggies so instead I added sesame seed. Everything else remained as directed. IT WAS GREAT!!

This is an awesome broccoli recipe!!! Only problem is every time I make it, there is never any leftover! Goes extremely well with many asian dishes and most grilled meats.
Oh, I use fresh heads and chop it bigger than the pre-cut florets. Generally, broccoli needs 3-4 mins max to boil/steam. Check it with a fork after every 2 minutes if you're not sure (remember florets closer to bottom cook a bit faster).  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I used frozen broccoli, turned out just fine. This dish would make a great start to a stir-fry.

This is my new favorite recipe although I toasted the cashews this time for about five minutes to give them a little bit more texture.  It was great.

I also double it and cook two chicken breasts, cut into bite sized pieces, in the sauce.  I let it simmer, covered, for about five to seven minutes and then add the cashews and broccoli and serve it over rice.  It is delicious!

Delish! We aren't broccoli lovers so I thought if I had a yummy sauce we might be able to take it down. Sure enough everyone loved it!  I did use less broccoli and there was plenty of sauce.

Absolutely delicious but loaded with fat and sodium. Would like to try to get the same flavor (again delicious) with healthier ingredients. I didn't have cashews so used cashew butter and it still came out great.

I made this one night with some chicken drumsticks.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  While not bad, I was wanting a more creamy sauce, or thicker sauce. I will say that I cut the recipe in half, since my kids were not willing to try it.  Maybe the alteration changed the flavor and consistency of the sauce.  Not bad, but not what I was wanting.

I've made this recipe dozens of times, and its still a big favorite with my family.  I always steam the broccoli but follow the recipe exactly other than that.  I've made it without the cashews and thats also great, and have made just the sauce to use with other recipes too.  Delicious and easy to make, thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used unsalted cashews because that's what I had on hand but didn't change anything else. My whole family loved it! My teenage son even said it was the best broccoli he's ever eaten.

I made this dish because I had broccoli in the fridge. I made this for my vegetarian son and his girlfriend. They really enjoyed and especially like the flavor of the cashews in the sauce. It was yum yum.

we both really liked this with some alterations given what we had/what other reviewers mentioned.. i only had one pound of broccoli.. i used a little under 2 T squeezable parkay for the butter.. left out the brown sugar.. used three packets of soy sauce (the kind you get at asian fast food joints).. used 1 T white wine vinegar for the regular.. left out the cashews.. added 2 T worcestershire sauce.. some cornstarch and water.. a couple of shakes of Maggi Seasoning (tastes like teriyaki sauce to me) and some salt.. i was surprised that some ppl were saying it was too salty seeing as how i needed to keep adding things.. the end product tasted like broccoli beef without the beef.. i think the original recipe would have been too bland.. but i'm happy with our results.. ty for the recipe

This is so delicious! We make it all the time (without the cashews though). 
It's not as high in fat as your think as much of the butter lightly coats the broccoli and then drips right off. 
Yum yum yum. Who knew so simple would be so amazing!

This was so easy and fast to make! I thought the sauce had a well rounded flavor, and it reminded me of an Asian type sauce. With the cashews being a protein source, this could be a main dish, or a filling side. GREAT idea. Thanks!

When my picky toddler would rather eat broccoli than fruit, we have a winning recipe! I did steam the broccoli instead of boiling it, and I substituted salted sunflower kernels for the cashews since that's what I had on hand. It was a good recipe with just a touch of sweetness but not enough to seem like a vegetable that wants to be dessert.

I thought this tasted pretty good, but it was definitely more of an Asian inspired side dish than an all-purpose vegetable side dish with any meal. I had about 1/2 lb of broccoli, so I changed the servings to 2. It was really easy to make. I just steamed the broccoli in about 1~2" of water in the microwave, covered with plastic wrap, about 5 1/2 minutes on high. I microwaved the sauce ingredients, after melting the butter, about 30 seconds.

This was DELICIOUS!  My 1.5 year old and 8 year old daughters, myself, and an 11 year old visitor loved this broccoli.  Everyone of us went back to the pan and got seconds.  I doubled the batch and was super impressed with how easy it was to make and how much I enjoyed eating it!  My 8 year old told me I need to go on the show "Chopped"...if she only knew how simple it was to make (;

This recipe was really good except the sauce seemed really salty and I am not usually sensitive to salt. Next time make it, I will use low sodium soy sauce. When I made this, I also cooked the broccoli about 4-5 minutes as suggested by other reviews and it was perfect - not too mushy. My family really did not seem to mind because they scarfed it all down!!

Yum, but a little too sweet for my liking, Westernised Chinese food.  Will make again with less sugar.

Made according to ingredients, just microwaved the broccoli instead of boiling. This is a keeper. So simple and so good. I ate it like candy. The only thing that would decrease this rating would be the that the butter and soy make it less healthy, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway since I will make it again.

Enjoyed them broccoli.  Has a slight Asian flavor but not over powering.  Served with white rice and grilled chicken. Will fix this again.

This is a really yummy taste but way too salty. Perhaps I'll use less soy sauce or find a way to dilute it next time.

This is a really good recipe as written!  My family, including two teenagers, all like this one!  We prefer the broccoli florets, but that's not material to my review. I've never seen teenagers enjoy broccoli more!

One of the best recipes I have tried on this site! I used only 2 Tablespoons of butter, apple cider vinegar, and slivered almonds (since I don't like cashews). Broccoli was already cut in small pieces, so I cooked it in the sauce.  Superb!! Dreaming about what to cook in this sauce next.

Love this combination of flavors. My only issue is that I wish the sauce were a bit thicker. I have drained the broccoli so I know the excess liquid does not come from there.  I have already made this 5 times as a stand alone vegetarian dish and as a side to Asian marinated flank steak.

We eat a lot of broccoli so it was nice to have a new recipe we hadn't tried before. We didn't find it amazingly delicious, but we definitely liked it. I just cooked the broccoli in the microwave for about 1 1/2 min. to save on time.

Only change was cider vinegar and slivered almonds due to what I had on hand. Family and friends (7) unanimously thought it was the best broccoli dish they'd had.

Pretty good - my husband was surprised that it was "kind of sweet" so I'll cut back on the sugar a little next time.  As leftovers, the cashews got soggy so they I'll add them last minute before serving to avoid this

This sauce was AMAZING! I made the it as is in the recipe, and then adjusted according to taste as it was simmering. I think I just made it a little sweeter than it had called for by adding some extra brown sugar. Great reviews from everyone. Will be making it again!

This is a good, easy to prepare recipe.  My husband loves spicier foods so I think I will try it with crushed red pepper next time. I thought it needed a touch more garlic also but still delicious.

If you cut the broccoli into bite size pieces and cook it for 7 minutes, you end up with broccoli mash.

I've made this recipe several times and love it! I follow the recipe exactly and it is easy and delicious. No adjustments required. I do use it on other veg, and even use it as a sauce for a stir fry - lots of veg, chicken, rice. Comes out delicious and is a bit different than my usual stir fry flavours.

Wow, my husband just went nuts for this! Even my 12 year old, who usually will only eat broccoli drowned in ranch dressing, liked it. I made the recipe as written and made it with oven "fried" garlic chicken and orzo pasta with butter and mozzarella cheese. My husband used the leftover sauce on top of his chicken and pasta and ate it up, begging me to make it again ASAP.

I put very very little butter, but this recipe was super delicious. I did not have cashews and replaced them with peanuts and this was still very delicious. A bit too much salt though. Next time i will look for low sodium soy sauce.

I just tried this recipe the other night and it was fantastic!  I didn't add as much butter as the recipe says as I was making it for two people and didn't use all of the broccoli, but even with the reduced butter amount it was amazing.  So good!!!!

Loved this one!  Made exactly as written.  It is difficult to get my husband to eat vegetables.  He only likes broccoli with melted cheese but he loved this one.  This will be a regular recipe that I will make often.

Actually I only used the butter, garlic, pepper and a little salt.  Then I added equal amount of olive oil to the butter.  That was delicious!!!

This was delicious!  I toasted the cashews first and that really did enhance their flavour.  Next time, I will try a bit less vinegar and add a squeeze of lemon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very-very good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It goes very well with roast if you don't have or don't like (like me) your gravy.  People thought the souce from the broccoli was actually the sauce for the roast.  By the way, I used Foolproof Rib Roast by Salsiepe - also a great one.

Makes broccoli and broccolini new favorites in my house. Though I personally add a little extra garlic and leave out the cashews.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a little extra sauce and reduce it more than the recipe said so that it would stick to the broccoli a little better. And I forgot to add the cashews, so I can't attest to that ingredient, but this is a definite keeper in my house.

I didn't even taste this dish when I made it because I really don't care for broccoli but everyone else does. Everyone loved it and it is now a regularly request pot luck item. Go figure. Imade it just as the recipe instructed.

I found the recipe far too salty for my taste! I even used low sodium soy sauce. The broccoli cooked well and the sauce had some good potential, but definitely too salty. I'd say up the vinegar and brown sugar, and down play the soy sauce!

Made this for supper with friends tonight, and wow!  We all loved the flavor of the sauce - perfect compliment to the broccoli.  There were only 4 of us, and hardly a cashew crumb left.  Next time I will follow others' advice and boil down the sauce just a bit. My husband after one bite declared "this is a keeper!".

Made this for a pot-luck dinner.  First time, the butter separated, so I made it again very carefully.  It happened again.  Still tasted great and had great reviews.  I refrigerated the first batch of sauce, and used it on microwaved broccoli and cauliflower.  Great flavor!

Absolutely yummy and a keeper! I made it in addition to brisket and corn on the cob. It was simple and enjoyed by all! The only modification I made was to add a little more garlic. I will be using this recipe often :)

Will make this one again--probably cutting back on the boiling time by a minute or two, and reducing the sauce only slightly.  I added 1 tbsp of corn starch to thicken as others suggested.  I served this over rice, which was fantastic.

Was really excited to try this based on the reviews.... had my doubts given a soy/butter base, but figured there had to be some simple magic in the combo of ingredients to justify the ratings.... but no...  this is an extremely bland dish..... I really wanted to like it too...

This was a big hit with everyone.  The only thing I may try different next time is see if the sauce will cook down to more of a glaze before adding it to the broccoli.

A good combination, but calls for way more sauce than needed. I would use three times more brocolli with this recipe.

Wow! This is so amazing.  Tastes like a 5 star restaurant prepared it yet it is so easy.  My husband said he could it a big bowl of this for dinner by itself. Thank you, I will most certainly be making this a lot since I grow broccoli in my garden.

I didn't have any soy sauce on hand, and I read a few reviews about the dish tasting too much like soy sauce, so I put a bit of balsamic vinegar instead of the white vinegar and the soy sauce just to taste. It still tasted fine. Will make it again.

This was good even when it was cold!    My husband was initially skeptical because of the break from the normal broccoli with cheese sauce....but he's convinced now that there are TWO ways to serve broccoli!  I will make this frequently!

Very good! Next time I might cut down the butter and soy (keep the brocc healthy!) and I added a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  A good one for "Cruciferous Vegetable Night" :)

This is a great recipe. My husband does not like cooked broccoli but he went back for seconds of this. I cut back on the butter and used part olive oil, everything else I used the exact measurements. I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe is Fantastic... We didn't have the cashews for it but it was still quite YUMMO..  I am going to try adding bacon to it instead of cashews and see how that is..  EXCELLENT.. 5 stars from my family.

This was super fast to make and tasted really good. We used a bit of the extra sauce on our mashed potatos, which was also very tasty. I used less butter (a little less than a 1/4c) and substituted pine nuts for cashews as I didn't have any cashews.

A nice change of taste for broccoli.  I served this on the side, but both guests and family enjoyed the sauce.  I used a 16-oz bag of frozen broccoli, microwaved as instructed on the bag.  I substituted one teaspoon of minced garlic for the two cloves of garlic and cooked the sauce on low heat.

I am not usually a broccoli eater, but I'm trying to add it in to my diet on a regular basis. This recipe is honestly the best broccoli I've had so far. I enjoyed eating broccoli for the first time tonight! Will definitely have again!

Delicious even without the cashews. I went stronger on the fresh garlic simply because we love garlic. I'm thinking that I should have chopped some peanuts that I had in the pantry since I did not have cashews.

This was great!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  On the other times that I have made it I cut back on the  butter, upped the garlic and left out the nuts.  It was equally good.  Nice change from just a butter or a cheese sauce.

This recipe tasted good, but was too runny. I prefer a thicker sauce that would adhere to the broccoli,at least a little bit. I might not of cooked enough broccoli for this recipe. Maybe it would of turned out better with more broccoli.

This was absolutely FABULOUS!!  My family raved about it and even my pickiest eaters who never touch broccoli loved it.  I didn't change a thing other than I did not add the cashews because I didn't have them on hand but I'm sure it would be even better with them.  I will be adding this to my regular recipes and am even tempted to make it again tomorrow because it was so good!

I made this with low sodium soy sauce and luckily I taste as I go because all I could tast was the soy sauce. I added about another teaspoon of brown sugar and another tablespoon of butter to make it not taste like just soy sauce. With those changes, it came out very good.

This is a wonderful twist for broccoli when you need a slight kick to your side dish.  The next time I make it, I'll cut back slightly on the soy sauce.

I make this dish for people who don't like broccoli, and it's always a hit! One change though, is I usually use less butter and more of the other ingredients, and lots and lots of garlic!

This recipe is fantastic...a new favorite!  I thought this would be a great way to try out our new food/rice steamer. This is now part of our regular "easy meal" rotation. Making and using the sauce, as written, we use broccoli, carrots, squash, snow peas and/or whatever other vegetables we have lying around and serve over steamed rice. Delicious. With this, I might just bring the husband over to my side - the side where meat isn't essential for EVERY meal :)

Super yummy and easy.  The more cashews the better and while I didn't toast the nuts, I can see why other reviewers suggested it.  I will next time to make them stay crunchier.

I had a head of brocolli and needed a quick recipe, I had everything on hand except the cashews. We had sliced almonds instead. I LOVE brocoli and it is a staple in our house, what a great addition to our regular recipes! I did cut the butter to 3 T and it definitely needed salt. But maybe if we had cashews that would have been enough salt? Will make again!

I was looking for a really quick broccoli side dish to serve for supper, and this fit the bill.  Absolutely delish, even without the cashews---I didn't have any on hand.

these were ok.  The sauce ended up very strong tasting.  Also, for those that suggested adding a bit of corn starch to thicken, I tried that and it caused the butter to separate.  I had a thick gluey garlic soy sauce mush floating in melted butter :( I had to throw it out and start again. The second time around came out as expected - it reduced nicely by itself but all in all I didn't care so much for these.

This was SO good!  I will definitely be making this often.  I cut the butter to 4 tbsps., used 1 tsp. of garlic powder because I was out of fresh garlic, omitted the cashews, and added a tbsp.  of cornstarch.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but I don't think it altered the flavor of the sauce.

This is so much better than broccoli with a little butter on it, or with a heavy cheese sauce. I like to steam my vegetables rather than boil. This is one of my favorite recipes! *I had to tell a fresh broccoli tip I've learned. (maybe everyone knows this already, haha) When I'm cutting fresh broccoli to cook, I cut off the florets and then cut the end off of the stalk. I use a sharp paring knife to grasp the edge of the thick peel and pull down with the knife. The tough peeling comes off easily and I then cut the stalk in smaller chunks. FYI the stalk is amazing cut into thin strips and eaten raw.

I followed the recipe (except I steamed the brocolli) and all those at my dinner party who like brocolli gave it 5 stars as well.  Warning-you may find it hard to go back to just plain or buttered brocolli after eating this.

This was awesome.  I didn't have any nuts in the house, and just made the sauce to pour on top.  You must try this.

Delicious!  I used just over 1 T of butter and it was fine.  Next time I might not add any.  Husband raved.  10 year old said it was way better than "regular" broccoli.  I also used a package of steam-in-the-bag frozen broccoli and just mixed the dressing ingredients in a ramekin (heated for a few seconds to melt the butter) and poured over the broccoli when ready to eat.  YUM!

Great way to cook broccoli for a change of pace. Used two bags of frozen broccoli instead of fresh and it turned out perfect. Served with prime rib and cheese mashed potatoes for Christmas dinner. It was a hit with everyone.

I am giving this 5 stars, although I only got one partial broccoli floret, as my entire (picky too) Christmas dinner guests devoured it!  It will be on my regular "go to" vegetable list.

Just OK. Against my better judgment I followed the recipe and cooked the broccoli 7 min. It was mushy - I like more crunch and taste. I thought the sauce would have more flavor - I really couldn't tell it was there. You can never go wrong with cashews, but they were just there among the mushy vegetable and flavorless sauce. It might have been helped by 1. Cooking the broccoli less; 2. thickening the sauce so that it sticks to the broccoli better.

Made it as the recipe is (no mods, I used margarine though) and it was wonderful! It also works great as a pasta sauce for egg noodles. I might reduce it a bit so it's a bit thicker but you wouldnt want it too "saucy" as it is very sweet.

Great combination of ingredients.  Found there was too much in proportion to the amount of broccoli suggested, so next time I'll cut dressing in half.

WOW WOW!! This is hubby and my favorite preparation for broccoli. We have it at least 2-3 times a week, it's that good, and makes eating broccoli such a pleasure! There is never any leftover and I can't say I've ever experienced that with my past broccoli cooking, haha. I follow the recipe exactly, except I sometimes add a dash more brown sugar and serve cashews on the side since hubby doesn't like them. Also I steam the broccoli, which makes it come out a little more al dente which is how we prefer and also the nutrients are conserved this way (vs pouring them down the sink with the drained water). This recipe makes me excited to cook and eat broccoli!

Served this with carrots and it was great. Can't wait to actually try it over broccoli. I sauteed the garlic & a little chopped onion in the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients. I would at least double the sauce next time so we have extra to put on our rice. Yum!

This makes an amazing sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of omitting the cashews.    I steamed my broccoli in the B&D Steamer Plus and spooned the sauce over each plated serving.  We had a little leftover sauce but zero broccoli!  This will definitely go into my regular rotation.

This is perfect.  I think it would serve as a great jumping-off point for a stir-fry as well.  I didn't change a thing, and for the first time ever in my house someone said "Uh, is there any more broccoli?"  Sooooo good.

I used to pay $7.95 for the "Broccoli with Garlic Sauce" dish at my local Chinese restaurant. Then I came across this recipe.... and guess what?  I don't go to that restaurant anymore because this recipe is actually better.....  NOT TO MENTION, WAAAY CHEAPER!  (Seriously, $8 for broccoli?!)

An AWESOME, simple to prepare, side dish!  This was a huge hit, and I will be making it again soon.  I didn't want the garlic to be too strong, so I cooked it in the butter for a couple minutes before adding the other ingredients.

Loved this! Have made it before and also used half the butter and soy. Put a tablespoon or so of water to stretch the sauce. That would of been too salty for my taste.

This was so easy to make! Absolutely delicious. I didn't have any cashews, so I made it without and it was still great. I also used chicken stock instead of plain water. I can't wait to try it next time with the cashews! Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty recipe to use up those ingredients I just keep lying around my kitchen.  I however did not have any white vinegar and I used the low sodium soy sauce, and it still came out very good.

Awesome love the recipe. Didn't have cashews, but the broccoli was fine without it. Will make again. I used low sodium soy sauce and had to add a touch of sea salt.

I messed this up by letting the broccoli cook too long :( So it was quite mushy. I also cut mine in bite sized pieces at the recipe says, but I should have just done it like the picture (which is NOT bite sized). The sauce was too watery..... I wanted it to stick more. I didn't really enjoy this as I should have. I will make it agin though and do it correctly (hopefully). I really want to LOVE this!

I used a little bit less butter than called for and didn't have cashews, so I threw in blanched almond slices instead. This was delicious! Update: I make this sauce for green beans, too, and it is super delicious on them as well. If I have less veggies than the sauce calls for, I'll use about 1 tbsp butter, 0.5 tbsp brown sugar, 1.5 tbsp soy sauce, a little rice vinegar, a clove of garlic diced, a pinch of pepper, and a drop of sesame oil. It always comes out amazing.

Thank you.  What a tremendous flavor!  I agree that the sauce was a touch on the salty side but others may feel differently.  I recommend using low sodium soy sauce if you are sensitive to salt. I added just a little extra sugar and it was perfect...to suit my taste.  Thanks again.  My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  It was rich but not heavy.

so good! I second everyone who said to thoroughly dry broccoli as it gets a bit watery, and cornstarch might be a wise addition. Otherwise, amazing. As my boyfriend remarked, "I'll never eat broccoli again without that sauce on it."

This was a surprise for me because I did not expect the favors to melted perfectly together as they did. I loved this dish and it will be a staple in my recipe collection. Simply d-lish and I personally would not change a thing; however, I can see how this recipe could have some diversity to it.

This is so good. I am always looking for a different way to serve sides and this one is a keeper. We did make a roux by adding a little flour to the butter after it had melted. We added 1T but that was probably a too much because we had to add a little water to thin it back out again. This would be a great sauce for chicken and broccoli in the wok, too! My husband is not a big Chinese food fan but he loved this.

Yummy! I used 1/2 recipe of the sauce for about 1/2 pound broccoli.  I sauted the garlic in the  butter (less than called for,  about 1 tablespoon), mixed the soy sauce (lower sodium), vinegar, and brown sugar together in a very small bowl with maybe 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch, then added the contents of the bowl to the butter/garlic and cooked until thickened.  Cashews were raw unsalted toasted briefly on a pan in my toaster oven.  This will be a regular here!

Fantastic! I only gave it a four because I was unsure of using it as a side dish(a little too much work for a side dish) or using it as a main dish. If you could incorporate chicken with this it would be a 6 star.

I have made this recipe several times, each time guests have begged for the recipe.  The sauce has a wonderful meld of flavors, a taste you strive to duplicate from your favorite oriental restaurant. Definitely double the sauce!  Excellent recipe.

Very good asian-inspired side dish.  The garlic butter was delicious and the cashews added a great crunch and flavor to the broccoli.  I used unsalted butter, low sodium soy sauce and lightly salted cashews to cut back on the salt.  We loved this and will be making it again.

DELICIOUS!  ALthough it was a little too fatty with the butter but the kids loved it!  Anything to get them to eat their veggies.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again for my family.  I made it for my friend too and she loved it also.

This is the closest homemade version of restaurant-style broccoli beef that I've tasted.  I am following a special diet that does not allow butter or sugar.  So I used olive oil instead of butter and REDUCED the amount to 1/4 cup of olive oil.  And I substituted pure maple syrup for the brown sugar.  Since the consistency was probably more runny than the original recipe, I whisked in 1 tsp. cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  My daughter said, "This is GOOD, and I don't even like broccoli!"  We loved it.  Thanks, SALSIEPIE, for sharing it!

YUMMY!  My whole family raved about this dish.  I made it easy by making the sauce first and then sauteing the fresh broccoli from my garden in it about 3 minutes or less.  Great flavors. Thanks for this recipe!

Extremely tasty side dish. Even made with almonds or peanuts or unsalted cashews is great. I also made it with less butter, but because I didn't have 1/3 cup. I also used chopped ready made garlic from the little jars, not fresh. Have made it already 2 times and will do again for sure.

Soooo tasty! I didn't have any cashews but the broccoli with just the garlic butter was plenty for me.  VERY flavorful and a good change from broccoli with cheese or plain! I will be making this one again!

We wanted to try something other than a green bean casserole for Christmas and this recipe really hit the mark with prime rib.  Very easy to make and using cashews (instead of peanuts) as a topper takes it to the top.  I might try steaming the broccoli next time.

My husband, who never has much to say about any recipe, said - WOW!. A huge hit for us on Christmas Eve. I mixed it up ahead of time and simply microwaved it to heat it up just before tossing with the broccoli. Such a simple recipe, with outstanding flavour! Thank you!

this was alright.  i found there to be way to much liquid (sauce) for the broccoli and it was extremely salty and strong.  double the broc or half the sauce and it's a much more subtle, enjoyable dish.  because this was listed in holiday recipes, i used it for thanksgiving dinner and it was awkwardly out of place - it's definitely a chinese type dish... not great for a turkey/stuffing sort of meal.

Excellent! My whole family (even my picky husband and grandson) DEVOURED it! I made it without the nuts due to allergies, but I can see how it would add great texture and flavor. The combination of flavors was yummy. I would use this sauce on sauteed fresh green beans, bok choy, chicken, pork - even double it and toss it with some chinese noodles or pasta! Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely delicious.  My son requests it all the time now (and he is only 6 yrs old!).   I would cut back on the butter though as it was a bit too rich.

The broccoli was great.  Everyone loved it.  The only problem that I had was making the sauce thick enough, but I hate cooking so it probably wasn't the recipes fault.  Anyway it was easy to make and delicious.

This is a great broccoli recipe.  We grew broccoli this past summer and this recipe is a great way to keep up with the abundance.  I half the amount of butter called for, with terrific results.  My family isn't big on nuts, but DH does love pecans, so that's what I use.

This broccoli is amazing! Even my 5yr old son who refuses to eat any vegetable cannot get enough of this broccoli! I make it exactly as stated, however, I have yet to add the cashews (I rarely buy them). Next time, I plan on cutting back on the butter though.

I really enjoyed this with our meal tonight.  I didn't put any nuts in but made the sauce using 50% fat margarine and it was very tasty.  I'll make it again like this soon.

I made this tonight and the only thing I changed was adding almonds because we had no cashews.  I'm sure cashews would have been better - but it was still awesome.  I made it as a side dish to meatloaf.  This is not a good side dish for meatloaf.  I picked this because I can never find a broccoli recipe that my kids will eat - but this went over ok with them (age 3&5) Next time I make this I will make it with shrimp as a main course over rice.  This was great!  (oh - and I did take reviewers advice and let the garlic saute a bit before adding everything else.

I didn't have any cashews. This was good. I can see why everyone says this is like a stir fry. It can easily be changed to one. I used leftover sauce over my rice.

Wow, this is a great way to eat broccoli! I did slim down the recipe just a little since I only had 1 head of brocc. and I didnt use the vinegar-It turned out fantastic, even my hubby liked it-he's not much of a brocc. fan. Thank you for the recipe!!!

Best broccoli I have ever eaten and so simple. Other then maybe the cashews, the ingredients are probably laying around the kitchen. Fresh broccoli is better (but when isn't it?), but frozen works well too. Great with or without the cashews. IF you normally boil your broccoli with salted water, I suggest you don't. Soy sauce has your salt covered. Thank you SALSIEPIE!

Great recipe. Next time, I'll probably boil the sauce for a couple more minutes so that it sticks better to the broccoli. And I used 3 tablespoons instead of 5, as some other reviewers suggested. Seriously fabulous though.

Insanely good!  I made the broccoli using one of those steam bags in the microwave.  This made a lot of sauce (excess in the bottom of the broccoli dish), so next time I will try pouring 1/2 on at first to save calories.  I could take or leave the cashews, but the recipe overall is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

This is a very delicious recipe. My only problem is I wish the sauce were a bit thicker so it would stick to the broccoli more. This tastes great with the recipe on this site "Sweet, Sticky, and Spicy Chicken".

Excellent recipe as is!  I only added the amount of sauce needed to cover the broccoli.  I saved the rest and ended up using it 2 more times.  My husband has asked for this vegetable dish every week.  My 2 year old even likes it!

Delicious!  I only use about 2 tablespoons butter or less.  Works well with green beans, mushrooms, squash and other veg, too.  If you like spicy, a bit of crushed red pepper is a yummy addition.

Left out the vinegar as I didn't have any on hand, but it still turned out great. Used about a cup of coarsely chopped cashews, unsalted. Easy yummy recipe I'll make here and there, thanks!

Really great! I was a little skeptical at first because I dont like soy sauce that much, but I really liked it. I made a little extra sauce to pour over some white rice. The cashews are an excellent addition. The sauce would probably be good on a lot of things, I am thinking it would be great for stir-fry. Also - I took someone's suggestion and used only  3 tbl butter and it was still really good.

This has great flavour!! With or without the cashews.  I ate mine with cashews and my husband and son ate them without. Just add them when you plate your food.  Here's the thing my 29 month old boy ate all his broccoli tonight and half of mine.  Next time I'll chop up two bunches of fresh broccoli.  Now I had a problem when adding in the corn starch the butter separated from the rest of the sauce.  To fix this I added a small amount of milk and it worked great.  This is a recipe I will definately do for family dinners and when company comes. Right beside the honey butter glazed carrots and garlic roast potatoes.

What a great way to mix traditional up!  I loved this, although my son is allergic to nuts so I missed out on that part...I can only imagine the extra flavor they would have added.  I will definitely cook this again and next time my son is not here I will add the cashews.

After I made this I had to double check to see if I did something wrong but I didn't find anything. Neither me nor my husband liked this dish. I think we'll just stick to good ole steamed broccoli.

Absolutely amazing! I was a bit skeptical about all the rave reviews. I mean, it is broccoli. How delicious can it be? But wow! So good. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Will definitely be making this again. And again. And again :)

My husband loved it, but I thought it was ok. All the sauce was just sitting on the bottom of the serving bowl. I don't know if I like the soy sauce and broccoli combo. It was a nice alternative for a side dish.

I did forget to season the chops with garlic powder and seasoning salt at first. As it was browning I seasoned the breading with it. It still was amazing! My husband does not like pork chops and he loved this. My kids even ate it and they enjoyed it too!

I'm so used to making broccoli and cauliflower, then dumping a bunch of cheese on top.[ Which is still good] This I thought was so good. I really liked the garlic and soy mixture, it really came through. I will diffently be making again.

Wanting to try something new with broccoli, I opted for this recipe.  Served this as a side to sweet and sour chicken.  Very easy and as another reviewer had suggested, I toasted the cashews in the oven.  Easy, quick and delicious.  My guests devoured it!  This recipe is here to stay!

My family thought this recipe was good, however I did not.  I was not a fan of the soy sauce and nut mix.  I would think you would need to be a fan of ethnic food to enjoy this dish, which would explain why I didn't like it.

Great way to perk up broccoli.  I had company and everyone, including the kids loved this.  I would agree that a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce would help the broccoli to hold it a litte better.

All I can say is YUCK! The cashews with the broccoli is a good combination but the soy sauce and vinegar made it inedible.

Very good!  It does make more sauce than needed, so you can use more broccoli if you have it.  I also used 2 tsp of soy sauce thinking that 3 would be too salty, but you can absolutely use 3.

This has a very unusual flavor, but it is quite good. My only problem was that the cashews were difficult to actually get onto the fork with the broccoli....they seemed to always separate and it was kind of a chore to physically eat this dish. Other than that : delicious!

This dishis always a success when i make it. I have used as much as double the cashews in the recipe and it was good. I steamed the Broccoli in my vegetable steamer and it worked just fine. I wish it was a big healthier though.

I cooked for my boyfriend and two of our friends the night I tried this recipe out. Delicious! We all loved it. The cashews were such a creative and yummy touch. Next time I'll make more of the sauce, because I used so much broccoli that it ran out.

Great!! Everyone loved it...even the "non" broccoli eaters.  I've made it twice and the second time I was asked to make extra.  I doubled the recipe and I still didn't have any leftovers.  Definitely a keeper.

Made this recipe as side dish for salmon one night for me and my boyfriend and it has become a regular.  We LOVE it!  Sometimes I will make extra sauce and mix the broccoli with some rice and chicken to make an entire meal. I have found you can use way letter butter (I use Light Smart Balance and its still great).  Of cource, we always add tons of cashews. SO yummy! Highly recommend!

I loved this recipe! My fiancee that is was a very nice change to our usual steamed broccoli. I halved the amount of butter the recipe called for and used olive oil instead. Also, I am allergic to cashews so we added chopped almonds. They were very tasty. Thanks for a great recipe!

I went to a party for New Years Eve and one of the guests made this dish on the spot! That's how fast and easy it is to make! I asked her for the recipe right away! I'm going to make this broccoli often! What a great new way to enjoy broccoli! Delicious! MMM!

Excellent.  I will make this again.  I used sliced almonds as I didn't have cashews and it turned out great.  I think this would be good with a mixture of veggies; cauliflower, carrots, onions, etc.

WOW! This was AMAZING. Even my 18 month old gobbled it up. I changed a few things: I used a few squirts of fresh lemon juice in place of the vinegar because I didn't have any. I also used olive oil in place of butter to make it healthier, and let the garlic saute in that for a minute or so. To thicken it, I added a Tbsp. of flour to the melted butter mixture and stirred it over low heat for 30 seconds or so. It was the best broccoli I've ever had. I can't wait to make it again tomorrow.

Excellent!  I received so many compliments on this recipe.  Next time I"m going to cut down a little on the soy sauce but other than that it was fantastic.

This was very yummy! I didn't have soy sauce or cashews on hand, so I substituted them for a peanut sauce marinade and almond slivers. Worked out well! Next time I will follow suggestions to cut down on the butter and let the sauce thicken a little.

Great recipe! As recommended by others, I cut back on the amount of butter and it was just perfect.  I did use a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Very easy way to perk up broccoli and will absolutely make it again!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I loved this recipe!  I just got it yesterday, and I tried it last night, and it was soooo delicious.  I steamed the broccoli in the mircrowave, and then covered it with the sauce.  I also just used 1 Tbsp of butter (didn't see any reason to use more), sauted the garlic in it, and then added the rest of the ingredient.  Also, I used peanuts instead of cashews, because that's what I had, and it still came out wonderfully.  Next time I will double (maybe even triple!) the sauce and add some chicken to it to make a main course.  Thanks for such a fabulous recipe!

OUTSTANDING! I made this for a dinner party of ten. It was a HUGE hit. This is also great with pan seared ahi tuna. I seasoned and cooked the tuna steaks. I then placed the tuna in a pasta bowl and surrounded it with the broccoli and sauce (without cashews). My husband said he felt like we were at a high-end restaurant!

Simply awesome! Since I didn't have cashews I used walnuts and used apple cider vinegar and it was probably the best broccoli I've ever had.

All 4 kids liked it as did the husband.  This will be a recipe I pull out when the vegetable choices get bland.  I used frozen broccoli and lightly steamed it in a steamer basket in an inch of water.  Worked perfect!!

This was a really good dish! I thought there was a little too much sauce but it was really good. Also the sauce was very thin a liquid and it would have been better thick but overall it is a very good recipe and I will make it again.

I served this to my visiting brother who used to get paid $5 to eat his vegetables. Now, at 46, he asked me not to tell his wife that he had TWO HELPINGS because she thinks he doesn't eat vegetables!! Thanks for sharing. It was a big hit.

I decided to make this recipe in search of something different and boy was I glad I did!  I had to modify it a bit because I was out of white vinegar so I replaced it with apple cider vinegar.  I also did not have cashews but the recipe still turned out fantastic!!  It reminds me of the sauce used in the oriental dish beef and broccoli  I think next time I will sautee the garlic in the butter first as another person suggested.  My family really enjoyed this especially my dh who is very picky.  Will definitely make again!

Very good broccoli recipe although I didn't use the butter.  I don't think butter goes very well with soy sauce.  I used light olive oil instead.  Everything did taste very good and I would make it again.

Very good change to same old broccoli recipes.  I did follow others and use a little less butter.  In a houseful of men like mine, new vegetable recipes are tough to get through.  This one did it!

We really loved this recipe. I cut back on the butter, and I am glad that I did. We ate it as a side tonight which is great but next time I think I will try it over some Shanghai Noodles or rice.

NOTE: Since I first reviewed this recipe I have used the sauce (without the cashews) for the House Fried Rice recipe on this site. It turned out fantastic!

I have never taken the time to rate/review a recipe, but I had to for this one. I made this for my in laws and really wanted something good. I have to say, this came out GREAT! It was super easy, even for a novice cook like me. I got rave reviews and will definitely be making this again.

Great sauce to add some zip to broccoli! This could even be used for a meat marinade. The cashews add a great texture and sweetness. I couldn't keep my hand out of the jar while cooking dinner! Mmmm. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I didn't have enough broccoli, so I threw in some baby chard, which also worked well (although the texture of the cashews was better with the broccoli). I subbed coconut oil for butter and used about 2/3 the amount, used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, and used rice vinegar. I think this could have used even more garlic--definitely a keeper!

Very good.  I thought that perhaps there was a bit too strong of a vinegar flavor, but my husband and I both really enjoyed it.  I plan to add chicken to it and serve it with lo mein for an asian-themed dinner in the future.

I am the only person who likes broccoli in my house so we substituted snowpeas.  The sause is wonderful and everyone just loved it.  I cannot wait to try it on some other veggies or even over chicken and rice.  The sause was the highlight.

This makes a flavorful and colorful mixed veggie stir fry, too.  The buttery garlic sauce is delicious served over fluffy white rice.

Wow.  This was amazing.  I bought some baby broccoli, which tastes like a cross between broccoli and asparagus, as my husband loves asparagus but hates broccoli.  And he ate this and loved it!  In fact, he was still raving about it the day after.  I didn't use cashews because I didn't have any on hand.  You must try it!!

Great recipe!  My picky husband and son loved this.  I have also used this sauce for fresh green beans and it works well.  Just steam the veggies first and then pour in the pan with the sauce.

Definitely not bad.  A little on the salty side with all that soy sauce, but my husband likes salty so he didn't mind that.  It's not overpowering.  The only change I made was to use slivered almonds instead of cashews because I don't particularly love cashews and never buy them.

I'm pregnant so I HAVE to eat loads of veggies. I have never done broccoli (frozen or fresh) and this was perfect! Bought fresh broccoli and followed the instructions.  It was not tart or overpowering from the vinegar and soy sauce. On the contrary, the taste was very subtle. I felt like a chef :)

i absolutely love this recipe! it is very quick and best with fresh broccoli, not frozen. i leave out the cashews because my husband doesn't like them, but other than that i don't change a thing. this is always a hit anytime i serve it to guest. the problem is snacking on it before the rest of dinner is ready because it is just that good!!

Really good, although I would cut back some on all the liquids. I rinsed the cashews in a strainer first to get rid of some of the salt. Went wonderfully with the "grilled salmon I".

What a great way to dress up broccoli.  This is very good!  I used 4 T butter and could have even gotten away with less.  I will thicken sauce next time OR serve over rice to soak up the deliciousness at the bottom of the serving bowl.  YUM!

I used toasted sunflower seeds as I didn't have Cashews handy and it was great.  I surely make it again and make twice the sauce as my kids just kept asking for more sauce.

Absolutely the best broccoli I ever ate, and I'm a broccoli lover. My husband's lukewarm on broccoli, but he liked this very much, too. I left off the nuts because one of the people I was serving has a problem with them--and we never even missed them. Delicious!

My aunt made this at a family get-together and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone gobbled it up and even went back for seconds. It's 2 days later and I'm totally craving it. I'm sure it would also be great with fresh green beans but the broccoli "soaks up" the sauce perfectly so I think I'll stick with the little trees. :)

OMG!  Thank you so much!  I have been looking for a way to spice up our usual frozen veggie sides at every dinner.  This one definitely did the trick!  Since I didn't have cashews on hand, I used a few sunflower seeds and it turned out great!  I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is fantastic.  I am a broccoli lover and this is now my favorite way to have broccoli.  I did not use as much butter as stated, and it was wonderful.

I fixed this for dinner last night, and we all liked it.  As others have suggested, I think I will try adding a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce next time I make this so that it will stick to the broccoli a little better.  I also cut way down on the fat, and used half butter and half EVOO.  I also sauteed the garlic just a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients - and added some finely chopped ginger (just 'cause I'm into ginger these days!); it addeded a nice "zing".  Thanks for a new way to serve broccoli.

Thank you Thank you!!!
I finally was able to get my hubby to eat a vegetable other than carrots or salad!!  In his own words "I couldn't even taste the broccoli", and that is a compliment!  I did use almonds (sliced), as I didn't have cashews on hand, added a nice taste and texture.  Great recipe, very easy!

This was great!  This sauce would be great on all types of vegetables.  It could even be used with noodles or rice.  Loved it - I will be making some extra just to keep around for a quick meal!

I fixed this recipe tonight with twice baked potatoes and a chicken wrap, and it was EXCELLENT. I've never liked broccoli before, but I absolutely loved this recipe. I raved about it for a while, and my family really liked it too although they weren't quite as enthusiastic. It's so easy to make I think it'll be included in a lot of my dinners.

I didn't have any cashews, so I used peanuts.  I thought they worked well with the flavor, but I look forward to making it with cashews next time.  the sauce needed a little cornstarch to thicken.  Interesting flavor.

This Broccoli was VERY GOOD. I replaced the Cashews with Walnuts but I can't believed how good it came it. It was not too sweet but not too plain. It was just prefect for a side dish.

This is my favorite broccoli recipe!

After making it exactly as directed the first time, the changes I now make are:

I use less butter. You just don't need that much. It makes plenty just using 2 or 3 tablespoons. 

I found it extremely salty with 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. I now use 1 or 2 tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce (you can adjust the amounts to suit your taste). 

Also, I have a steamer and just cook my broccoli in that.

The flavor of the sauce is great.  It would probably be really tasty with some chicken added to it.  It reminded me of the Broccoli Chicken I get at a local Chinese restaurant.

This was the first time my guests raved about the broccoli. A perfect side dish for hosting and easy to make. I cut back on the butter and will cut back even more next time. I don't think we will miss much more than the fat.

This was really good.  I made it with frozen broccoli florets.  I also added 2 chopped green onions and doubled the soy.  Added a touch of spice with a little dash of chili oil. I did let the sauce cook a little while to thicken up.  Turned out perfect.  Very tasty.

I wasn't overly impressed with this.  Maybe the title was giving me an idea that I'd have garlicky broccoli.  Instead, it had more of an oriental flair with the addition of the soy sauce.  I'm glad others liked it, though.

This recipe is so easy and sooo good.  My 7 yr old gobbled this up. This was my first time using fresh broccoli.  I don't know why I haven't bought fresh before. It was super easy to put together and tasted fantastic.  Definitely a keeper.

This was wonderful!  I used the new sealable steamer bags to steam my broccoli which made this recipe even faster to make.  I doubled the recipe and served it at a dinner party for 12.  Everyone loved it!  This week I am going to try making broccoli beef with it.  I have one batch of the recipe working as a marinade with thinly sliced sirloin.  Can't wait to see how it turn out.

I will try this again since so many gave it a good review.  I found the sauce too thin. Next time, I will use a little cornstarch as suggested. I used a mixture of  frozen broccoli and cauliflower  I will try this again since so many people gave it a good review.

My family loved this recipe, even my picky husband! I added brussels sprouts in with the broccoli, only because I needed to use them up, and it was delicious! Next time I will add a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit, or possibly let it simmer a little longer. We will definitely repeat this one! Thanks!

I LOVE broccoli & this just kind of ruined it in my opinion.  I think it was a bit too sweet for my taste and will stick with butter on my broccoli as have always done before.  Gotta try the new recipes though to know if you like them or not.

I've been in a funk from broccoli lately and was looking for something different to awaken my interest in it, especially since we've been trying to eat more because of the health benefits, and I think this recipe is it! A good alternative to my boring steamed with s/p and a hint of butter. Adding the corn starch is a must for us. We often serve this with rice and chicken. I like to mix this recipe and the rice/chicken together on my plate. Has an Asian flair...

This was wonderful!  We didn't change a thing!  It was great with Morracan Chicken and Cous Cous.  Everyone loved it and no one was miserable when they got up from the table since the meal was so light.

Ok, I totally improvised on this one.  I realized I was out of soy sauce after I started cooking, so I ended up substituting some worcestershire sauce instead.  I also used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar... and almonds instead of cashews.  But bottom line, DELICIOUS and easy.  I'm not even a big broccoli fan and I thought the sweet/salty sauce and the nuts were a nice complement.  I do agree with another reviewer and will probably add a little cornstarch to the sauce next time.  And there will be a next time!

This recipe is easy and incredibly delicious!! It's for those of us who always want to make a great side dish but are unsure of what to do. The sauce turned out a little runny, even after adding corn starch, but that in no way took away from the flavor. So yummy and easy this will definitely become a familiar dish in my home.

This is an incredible recipe! It never ceases to amaze
me how the simplest recipes are usually the best. The
only thing I changed was to add 1/2 tablespoon of
cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water to the sauce to
thicken it. In less than 15 minutes you have a dish
that rivals a 5 star restaurant. Highly recommended!

This is the best Broccoli side dish I have ever made.  It was so yummy, my family loved it.  I get tired of broccoli casserole with cream of some kind of soup or processed cheese.  This seriously hit the spot and it will become a regular in my house from now on.

Wonderful!!!  Everyone at my New Years Day dinner went for seconds.  Made it as the recipe stated and chopped the cashews fine so grandpa could eat it too.  Will make frequently!!!  Paired well with ham.

Made this tonight as a side for my Sunday dinner and it was really good.  I completely overlooked the vinegar but it was still good. Next time, I will try the vinegar too. Made this along with some chicken that I marinated in "Korean BBQ Chicken Marinade" and "Coconut Pie" from this site and some fried rice.  I was so proud because everything laid out so beautifully on the table.  Thanks!!

I was a little scared by this recipe.  The soy and the vinegar seemed like it would be overwhelmingly tangy, but it was actually really good.  I think next time I will try to thicken the sauce a little bit, as other users have suggested.

This makes a quite nice side dish. The flavors are strong though so pair it with similar tastes.  I would recommend doubling the amount of broccoli and making 3/4 the amount of "sauce".  A little goes a long way but it's mighty tasty!

Wow!! Incredible taste to the broccoli!! Although, it did seem a little runny as what i would like it.. Next time i would add some 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the sauce to make it more thicker. But overall its excellent taste and will do again!!!

Wonderful recipe!!  I have tried several broccoli recipes that I've liked, but not my family.  They are melted Velveeta fans and I'd given up finding something else.  I was out of Velveeta and so gave this a try, while they didn't care for the for the cashews, but I loved them, they did have seconds, which floored me.  Thanks so much for an alternative to the overused standard!!!

This is absolutely wonderful as is, but the sauce is also fantastic as a chinese stir-fry adding carrots, celery, onions and papper.  Simply stir fry the veggies (the broccoli too) and add 2 tsp cornstarch to the sauce before adding to the vegetables in the pan.  Stir to mix and allow to thicken a bit.  Then serve over rice.  A GREAT vegetarian meal.

OMI Gosh, saw this recipe on this site and thought it sounded good. I was wrong, It was absolutely delicious. Family devoured it within minutes of it hitting the table.
Even the grandkids came back for more.  I am serving it to the WHOLE family for Thanksgiving dinner.

This was SO good!  I like broccoli but was getting SO bored with it.  This was a great twist and my husband and I loved it.  The kids did not like it, but will probably have to get used to the shock of not having the same old broccoli they are used to.

This is the one vegetable recipe my husband requests over and over.  It's a favorite of ours.  I tried it with frozen broccoli last week, and it wasn't as good; I'd stick with the fresh.

I'm not sure if I goofed this one or not.  The sauce didn't thicken.  Maybe it's not supposed to.  Although I drained the broccoli well it was still a bit runny. It Tasted good.  I would like to try it again, but first I need to come up with a way of thickening the sauce.

This is really tasty. Great flavor for a side dish. I didn't have cashews so omitted them and used cider vinegar, I really don't think that affected the taste. I will plan on using this recipe over and over again!

This tasted good, but I couldn't get the sauce to look right! The first time I made it, it burnt! Then I tried again immediately after, it was better but not to the level I wanted it to be. I still don't know what I was doing wrong. I will try this again and hopefully it turns out right, I think my problem might have been in retrospect that my heat was too high.  Btw, I skipped the cashews as some of my guests were allergic to nuts. I served it on Thanksgiving, made a nice side dish.

This was good, I ended up cutting back on the broccoli and serving it over rice noodles (in a bowl as the sauce is very thin & runny) I wouldn't try and thicken it, it soaked into the rice noodles nicely.

Very good.  I didn't have cashews so I substituted sunflower seeds. I agree that thickening the sauce is a good idea.  Will definately make this again.

The best broccoli I have had in a long time. Good flavor, would go great with oriental meal. I used frozen broccoli only because I did not have the fresh. This one is going in my recipe box.

This is the best way to serve broccoli! Especially if you like garic. The only thing I changed was that I sauted the garlic in the butter first..
I steamed the broccoli in my large steamer for 7 minutes, was perfect! Everyone was impressed and it disappeared in minutes.. A definite keeper!

Okay recipe.  The sauce didn't adhere to the broc enough though and puddled at the bottom.  Also a bit the butter taste was a bit overwhelming.

My husband didn't like this recipe at all, but I thought it was awesome!  I didn't have cashews so I used walnuts and it still came out great.  It definately has a strong taste to it, but if you dont mind zip than this is the recipe for you!

Delicious and so easy!  I didn't have cashews so I used mixed nuts and it was great! From reading the other reviews, it is obvious that cashews aren't the only choice.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I found this recipe wonderful! It was somewhat sweet & sour but with the added texture and flavour of the cashews! Yum. Next time I will try what Theresa R. suggested.  I think I will also saute my garlic as well.

This recipe was easy to make, although it didn't turn quite good. I had to do this recipe twice before I was satisfied with my result. The appearance really looked nice, although I think it had too much vinegar. Anyway, will probably make, better yet, improve this again with my tastes. Thanks for the basic recipe!

I made this for an extended family get together and got rave reviews on it although I didn't care for it.  It was a little too sweet for my taste buds but I'm sure I'll make it again and just cut down on the sugar.

I didn't think broccoli could taste so good but this recipe is amazing! I didn't have cashews so I used raw almonds. I'll try it with the cashews next time. I'm sure I'll be making it again, very soon.

Delicious dish- the only tip I would offer is that the broccoli cooks quicker than you would think so keep an eye on it.  Wonderful though!  Thanks!

Fantastic!  I was finally able to get my eight year old to eat broccoli, and he said he loved it.  I substituted blanched almonds for the cashews becaue that it what I had in the pantry.  Thank you.

Delish!  This sauce reminds me of a sauce that I really like at my favorite Chinese food place in the U.S.  I tossed the broccoli and sauce together in a bowl to make sure that it was well-coated.

Made this last night with Aussie Chicken from this site, and really enjoyed this different take on broccoli. I just steamed the broccoli instead of cooking in water. Interesting flavor combination in the sauce that was very tasty. I love the crunch the nuts added. Mext time I will toast the nuts first to bring out a little more of their flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again! Yum!

This was very good.  I gave it four stars because I had to modify it a bit.  I would suggest a little less butter because it does turn a bit oily.  I also chopped some broccoli and threw it in a ziplock to quickly steam it.  Then I added the broccoli to the sauce and cooked it together for a few minutes.  I also didn't have any cashews, so I used crushed peanuts.  It was very good with the peanuts.  The peanuts gave it a bit of a Thai flavor.  Thanks for the recipe I will make it again.

Like a few other reviewers, I'd either steam the broccoli or cook it in the sauce itself.   Err on the side of al dente ... there are few things worse than overcooked broccoli!

This was pretty good, but next time I will add more garlic and maybe more soy sauce...will definitely make again though!

I think this would be better if you cook the broccoli in the sauce for a few minutes. more flavorful. Toasted almonds was what I used and enjoyed.

This was a good and different way to prepare broccoli.  Next time I think I might actually steam the broccoli in the sauce since the sauce is very thin and didn't really coat the broccoli how I would've liked.  Overall, this was good though.

WOW!!  Was this a surprise.  I didn't know what to do with broccoli the other night, so I looked here for a recipe and found this.  We just loved it!  It's like beef and broccoli without the beef.

Fantastic! I used only three tablespoons of butter to make it more healthful, and also cut down on the soy sauce.  Both my husband and I loved this dish.

Everyone loved it.  A real crowd pleaser.  Only problem was that like the recipe says, you have to serve it immediately or the broccoli gets mushy (however it still tastes great).  I would not put the cashews in until right before serving and maybe toast them first also.  I would also use more crushed garlic and maybe a bit more soy sauce next time.

Excellent!  I even got my 9 year old to eat the broccoli and that's a first.  It was very good, a nice change from plain old steamed veggies. If you don't like a lot of salt, I would drop the soy sauce a bit, but we loved it as is.

I have been an avowed broccoli-hater...until now.  An effort to prepare more healthy food for my husband and myself, I investigated recipes for broccoli hoping to find something that would make it palatable.  Imagine my surprise when I found something that actually makes broccoli something on the regular menus.  I've used this recipe just as listed...with the omission of the cashews.  Neither of us are big nut fans, but this recipe stands well without them.  Bravo and thank you!

This was a very good broccoli dish. It's not the best I've ever had but still good. I liked the vinegar and the brown sugar. The cashews also added a nice crunch to contrast the tender broccoli.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I didn't have cashews in the house so I used butter toffee almonds instead. Simply delicious!
