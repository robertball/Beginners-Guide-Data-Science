I liked this recipe it is completely different to what I had before. The ginger is very powerful so next time I will cut the amount I use. The coconut milk and the pumpkin together make this delicious. I added more coconut milk to make less thick the mixture.

It smells pretty good. I think it could be a little sweeter.

This was delicious! I had left over pumpkin and coconut milk and decided to give this recipe a try. I did halve the ginger and it was perfect. Filling and healthy breakfast. I definitely will make this again.
