I made this recipe for a party I recently had and it was a hit! I followed everything to the T and all the ingredients came from my garden. Those who had found out that it was watermelon were afraid to try it at first but after trying it they all wanted the recipe.

This recipe is a great way to get rid of extra watermelon.  I was a bit apprehensive just looking at the ingredients, but it was delightful.  The sweet and spicy combination is great!

This was perfect to go with the spicy ribs that I prepared but it would go great with almost any grilled dish - Very refreshing - it went quickly!  Thanks submitter.

Just loved this- and will make it many many more times! Great way to use up leftover watermelon. I found Anaheim peppers (spicy!) but think jalapeno peppers could do well too. I pulled some fresh cilantro (about 1/2 TBS) from my garden and threw in about 2 TBS of lime juice. It was devoured quite quickly!

Interesting, and different from the normal picante.  Sweet and spicy.  (Don't let on it's watermelon before guest give it a try.)  Most respond they love it!

Like other reviewers stated, the ingredients combination may throw you off, but once you taste it, it's incredible! I substituted the Anaheim pepper for two seeded jalapenos, and I also added a pinch of dill weed.

This tasted fantastic and a great start for a watermelon salsa.  I personally tweaked the recipe.  I substituted the chile with half a habanero (which amounted to less than a tablespoon) and filled up to the remaining 3 tablespoons with green bell pepper for color and texture.  I also added a 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  I personally thought the salsa was slightly too vinegary, so maybe next time I will reduce to 1 1/2 tbsp balsamic.

Overall, fantastic recipe!

This was super simple to make and delicious!  I used jalepeno peppers for more spice.  I started eating it before the hour marinating time was up and it was already good!  Fed it to my hubby who thought it was tomotoe until he had his first bite.   He loved it!  I'll be making it again and again.  Thanks for sharing!!

I found this recipe last week, and have already made 4 batches of it!  I added a jalapeno for some extra heat, but love the original recipe!  It tastes just like the watermelon gazpacho I get from a local restaurant....but way cheaper since I grew all the ingredients in my garden!!!

Love this salsa! Made it the first time for just my husband and myself to test it out. He is quite picky about his salsa and he loved this too. Asked me to make it for guests that we had over this weekend and suggested I double it. Good thing I did, it was loved and devoured quickly. Such a great summer recipe and really easy! (We couldn't find Anaheim pepper the first time so I substituted green pepper. Either is great!)

This was really delicious, I will def make again although Im going to use some other reviewers suggestions and add some lime juice and cilantro, maybe try another type of pepper.  I cant wait to bring this to some upcoming cookouts this summer.

Okay this was really good. Had extra watermelon from a BBQ, so I used up the slices. (I still have 2 whole melons left though!) I didn't have the peppers so I chopped green pepper, green onion and add cayenne pepper and a tsp of lemon juice. Delicious! I didn't even want to eat it with anything, it was so good by itself!

Excellent. I prepared the salsa two nights before a dinner party and it was rather "hot" when my wife & I first tasted it. The "heat" dissipated by the time we served it, and everyone really loved it. 
Very refreshing!

This was better than I would have thought. I used jalapeno sparingly since I didn't have any anaheim peppers. If I make this again I will add some cilantro, I think that would bump it up to 5 stars.

I love this recipe and was so surprised by it! The first time I made it we just experimented and ate it with homemade tortilla chips. We used the left over's the following night to pour over grilled Cod.. and what a hit! It will be a staple in my fruit salsa group!

This is a refreshing choice of salsa.  You can make it as hot or mild as you like.  I used fresh minced garlic (not too much) and added cilantro.  Very good!

Really good recipe I followed the recipe almost exact, except i used fresh green chiles instead of anaheim peppers becuase i didn't have any and didn't have time to run to the store. My husband really liked this and he doesn't even like watermelon. we put it in crepes turns out really yummy!

Very simple recipe. Hubby was giving me weird looks as I told him the ingredients to add, but then after tasting, couldn't stop him finishing the whole bowl!! Tastes very refreshing! I think some cucumber and coriander would go well as well. Will be making this again.

Adjusted this just a bit based on what I had on hand and used green onions instead of regular onions, omitted the garlic and used two jalepeno peppers. Wow! Talk about a hit! This is a keeper for sure! Perfect balance of hot and sweet!

Quite different, but a bit bland for me. So I spiced it up a with some jalapenos and more garlic salt. Here's the portions I used which yielded enough for a decent sized party (20-30 people).

1/2 small watermelon (8C)
1 anaheim pepper (3/4C)
1 jalapeno pepper (1/4C)

This is an easy, tasty and different recipe. I thought it was a good way to use watermelon.

This is by far the best Fruit salsa I have made and it is quick and easy to boot!  I took a little risk by serving the to the family but they could not get enough!  Everyone loved it and I bet you will too!

my new favorite thing. as another rater stated, the balsamic really works (especially since i had a particularly sweet melon).  this literally melts in your mouth. now i'm on a quest to find/create a recipe that will shine with this.

Too bland for me.  I added a little salt, half a jalapeño, a teaspoon of lime juice and a couple slices of mango and that made it much better.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it.  No one had any idea it was watermelon - just looking at it you'd think it was tomatoes.  It was loved.

Super simple to make.  Thinking of serving it with cinnamon pita chips next time.

Amazing - and works well using strawberries in addition to the watermelon (which tends to make it soppy).
