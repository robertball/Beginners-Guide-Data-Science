This review is for the dressing alone, as I did not make the croutons or the salad as stated. This was absolutely DELICIOUS! The flavors went together wonderfully and I literally can not wait to make it again! I made a spinch salad with vidalia  onions, hard boiled eggs and store-bought croutons. This dressing is definately worthy of 5 stars~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wonderful!!!!! Salad and dressing was amazing!  Didnt do croutons as didnt want to add the fat to such a healthy dish!  This will be a regular in my house!! Oh! and we used fried canadian bacon instead of bacon it called for.

I think I might have messed up the croutons, as they were a lot of work and not worth the effort, but the rest of this salad is to die for!! added romaine to the spinach.

Excellent.  I didn't make the croutons - not enough time.  Meant to add store bought croutons, but forgot once the party started.  Even without croutons, it was delicious.  I had one vegetarian guest, so I put crumbled bacon on the side for people to add as desired. It was a hit.  Got many compliments.
