This recipe is lovely and very easy. I made it last night and it was the very first time I had used my hand me down bread maker. The loaf was a little short but I had accidentally had my maker knead the dough twice so I'm not sure if that was a factor. I will be trying this one again :)

This is a great fluffy white bread recipe. One alteration suggestion. If you use bread flood instead of AP floor the bread rises to a full size loaf in the bread machine. Turned out just as fluffy when I made it the second time with the bread flour. Great recipe.

This is the BEST and easiest bread recipe ever! So soft and fluffy! Since I’m using old bread machine set on medium crust-white bread, the first time I tried this, the bread fell. Then, I reduced the yeast to only 1 TSP, it worked out wonderful, although it was kinda short, about 3/4 loaf of the pan. I experimented a few times to get a full loaf: microwave 1 cup of room temperature water for 1 minute, then add honey, stir, and add yeast, then leave it for 10 minutes, then add 2 cups of flour--make sure the flour covers water-honey-yeast mixture, then add the rest of the ingredients. That's it! You'll get a full loaf. I also added 2 TBSP of Golden Flaxseed Meal, and sometimes 2 TBSP almond meal/flour. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Fabulous! I've made this bread twice this week. One modification: Subtracted 1/8 cup flour and added 1/4 cup of Bob's Red Mill Wheat Gluten. I couldn't find any notes in the recipe about what size loaf it makes so I took a guess.  I set the breadmaker for a 1.5-pound loaf. It rose far, far above the pan - a huge loaf - and was perfectly baked. I've never had a better loaf of bread from my breadmaker. It's almost a delicacy.

I make loads of bread in my bread machine--usually I make the dough then pop it in the oven, and I rarely get a loaf of bread that doesn't work out that way.  I've made bread we haven't liked as much, but it almost always works this way.  I did that with this bread and I have to say that either this is a bread that should only be made in the bread machine (highly unlikely in my opinion), or it's just not a bread that works for us.  I doubled the recipe because just by glancing at the ingredients I knew it would be a small loaf; however, that made for a sticky mess in my bread machine.  Don't worry, I'm used to them, but after putting it in the oven to rise, it rose too high and I ended up with another sticky mess--and that I'm not used to.  I tried again, then let it bake . . .and well, it worked, we got a loaf of bread, but hubs wasn't impressed with this.  It does have air pockets, and it's chewy, but it's not that soft--believe me, my husband is a stickler about that, so I would know--and it isn't as tasty as some of the breads I've tried.  Although okay, it's not our favorite.  However, it does remind me somewhat of English Muffins, so if you like that texture, you may want to be all over this bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Bakers - do remember that bread making is a science regardless if you are doing it by hand or in a bread machine.  Knowing better,  but rushed for time, I followed the directions accordingly and got a very tasty loaf but the rise was not good.  This is often a sign that the dough was too wet. (the yeast that I used bloomed beautifully). I now babysit the bread machine while it is in the initial stages of mixing and kneading to make sure the dough has enough flour.  I know when it is ready when I can see that it no longer sticks to your finger or to the side of the pan.  On average, I am adding up to a 1/4 cup or more of flour - in very small increments- depending on the humidity in the air. I do check the dough right before the second rise as well.  By adding these steps, the bread now bakes up to the size of a 2 lb loaf while using ingredients for a 1 lb.  We love the lightness of the loaf and it makes for great garlic cheese bread or just toast.  Thanks for an easy recipe.

Made it for the first time today--exactly as directed and it turned out amazing.  It's about 1/2 the size of a normal loaf--but about 10 times more amazing.  Perfect with butter and jam!  Great with soup!  My family ate the whole 1st loaf and I had to make another one for dinner!

I'd really like to know how anyone got this pile of  to bake into an actual loaf of edible bread. I'm an avid baker. This is the worst loaf I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. It was like yeast soup in the pan. Baked into a brick. I have no idea how you guys got this to bake into a fluffy loaf. Please share your magic trick.

I rarely leave ratings, so trust me. This is by far the BEST bread I have made in my machine. It is a smaller loaf then any others I have made, but my kids were getting upset that I could only make tough, dense bread until this recipe. LOVE it, will be making more, for sure.

I'm not really quite sure how to rate this, to be honest.  The loaf is only about 4 inches high.  My yeast was fine, as it proofed perfectly, yet this loaf just didn't rise for me.  However, the inside is a lovely texture, full of little air pockets as promised, and it smells heavenly.  I think if this had risen well it might have been fantastic.

The instructions are incredibly vague and the dough didn't make. It was more like batter. It didn't rise like it was supposed to. 

After baking, I cut it and tasted it. It was moist, but it tasted like rubber bands due to using 4 teaspoons of olive oil.  I don't know about you, but I do not like eating moist rubber band cake bread.

I liked this recipe but decided to alter it slightly.   I like to remove the paddles at the 2 hour mark.  After I remove dough onto a floured board I reshape the dough and grease the pan and posts with butter, then put the dough back in pan.  I keep the bread machine closed during this process so as not to lose heat.  I also found the addition of 1/2 cup of flour helped the loaf hold up better.  And an 1/8 of a tsp.  of ascorbic acid to help with the shelf life of the loaf.   Now it is a wonderful tasty light bread.  Yum!!!

We love this bread, it reminds me a lot of English muffin bread with lots of nice holes for the butter to puddle in.  My son loves it.  It was a small loaf, so I doubled it the next time and it was normal size.

Not what I expected, but very good! 

The dough was more like a batter and the loaf was short and kinda ugly, I thought it was a total flop, but it won in the taste department. It's kinda English muffin meets sourdough.  Great with ham.

This loaf was spongy (not in a good, light and airy way) and the taste was not good.  I'm so disappointed as the reviews were all so great for it.  I'll try again in a few days and update my post if I get a better result.

Probably the best bread recipe ever! You do need to add more salt so that it doesn't drop in the middle but other than that it is wonderful!

Thank you for sharing this recipe - we love it at our place. I know some people claim it makes a short loaf but it's not my experience. I adjusted to 12 serving, thinking it would be a 1 1/2 lb loaf. it's HUGE! it rose way to the lid and I had to  poke it down. even so, it turned out great! light, fluffy and full of air pockets. it is very tasty. definitely a keeper!

Thank you for this recipe it worked very well and I finally have a bread - maker bread that isn’t heavy as brick. I modified slightly by using 2.5 cups of flour and a little more honey as my kids like the taste.

This is my family’s favorite Italian bread.  I used a garlic infused olive oil and it brought out the flavor.  I bake it in a curved pan that I bought from King Arthur.  The bread comes out beautifully and sooo big.

I literally threw this bread out after baking. :(  It made a very sticky and gooey mess in my bread maker. It’s very fluffy inside (the fluffiest I’ve ever seen from a bread machine, but the taste is really quite bad. It’s very bland and doughy (hard to describe, but it’s not normal bread flavour). I gave a piece to my husband, the “bread king”, without influencing his opinion. His reaction was, “what the *explative* did I just eat?” - yeah it’s THAT bad! I laughed so hard and then took a picture of my deflated fluffy bread (I know, this is a contradicting statement, but that’s exactly what it was), and shared the flop with my family. I had to make a positive out of this disaster some way! The outside was burnt to a crisp because it overflowed, and it was sunken in the middle with gewy uncooked dough on the outside edges. I used brand new yeast and my other loaves have turned out beautifully. I thought this recipe would be so good based on the reviews. I’m so dissapointed and can’t possibly understand how this could have gone so terribly wrong! The only thing that may have made a difference was I used an older bread machine (2008), Oster, but this is the only bread recipe so far that has been a flop. I’m glad others had success, but this recipe is not for our family.

I loved it!  I like the fact that it is a small loaf since I can only eat so much fresh bread. I put my machine on 1 pound and light crust. The dough was very damp so I sprinkled a little extra flour on it, but not much. It was still very damp but I like to try recipes the way the person posts them. I used bread flour and ended up with a great loaf. I will be making this many time since it is so easy. Regarding the yeast, I have read where if you activate it first, as directed, you will not have a heavy yeast taste.  That proved true in this recipe.

It does make a smaller loaf as people have mentioned. I have had it sitting here for a mere three hours and the loaf is almost gone!! The recipe lives up to its name for sure! It is light and fluffy with a crisp crust. The perfect bread maker bread closest to store bought.

I may bake the next one in the bread machine, but I haven't had such good luck with other recipes, so when it came out after the dough cycle as more like a batter bread, I wondered if I'd misread the amount of flour. But I decided to bake it anyway, and I'm so glad I did.  It doesn't rise very high, and it doesn't brown up like "regular" bread, but it tastes great.  I'll make this again, and I may even try baking it in the machine, too, to avoid the mess of turning it out into a bread pan.  Thanks!

Wow!!!!!! the best tasting bread and the softest.  I was about to give up making bread because I was so tired of hard bread, but this saved me.  We love this recipe.  Great organic and non gmo recipe!

I didn't do anything special with the yeast and water, just put all the dry ingredients in the machine, then the wet ingredients (and our machine has you put the yeast in a little container in the lid, which it dispenses at some point on its own). The bread was SO light and SO airy that it was a bit difficult to cut without crushing even when it was cool! But it was so much nicer than the dense and chewy white breads we've made previously, so we'll definitely make it again!

wow soft .. I did everything like the instructions said to do.  I only add a little garlic powder to it. next will be garlic cloves slices.. the sink a little on one side. but I don't care if it's not perfect shape. I love that it's soft. also in the description it didn't tell me if the put it on light medium or dark crust, so I chose light. and also it didn't tell me if I should put it on small medium or large loaf so I kept it on medium size loaf.  thank you for your recipe.

So I really wanted to like this recipe. I made it and it was all concave. Can someone help? Are we sure it should be AP flour? And not bread flour. I want to try this again. What I did get tasted decent. Just didn’t come out.

Great staple, but I found the loaf a bit small. My machine does 1.5 and 2lb loaves and I think this recipe yields a 1 lb loaf. Next time I’ll just double. But I love the simple ingredients, the flavor and crust were yummy, it truly was soft, and my whole family enjoyed it very much. It’s a good bread recipe and is now on my go to list.

I have been looking for a while now at how to make bread machine bread better, and by that I mean fluffy and light, not so dense. This recipe exceeded my expectations by a lot and I will be making this regularly. The only changes I made were throwing in some dehydrated apple chunks and also I used butter instead of oil. Taste wise - I'll put it this way, it lasted two hours and then the loaf was gone.

I have made this twice now. The first time the bread was really ugly but so yummy! The second time I cut back on the yeast slightly and added more flour. I also added a tsp of bread improver, Half AP flour and Half Bread flour (adding more AP flour as needed though the kneading cycle) tasted just as delicious and this time my loaf didn't cave in! This is the closest I have came to making my Grandpa's homemade bread! Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is the best machine white bread I've made thus far. I have tried a few different machine bread recipes, but this recipe is just what I have been looking for. All the other bread recipes I have made in the past have been to dense for my liking. This bread came out light and airy. It does make a small loaf, but its a big hit in my house. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  Slightly crispy on the outside soft as air on the inside.  For me I added 1/4 teaspoon each of Rosemary and Thyme to it.  The smell while it was baking was fabulous!  I will make this over and over again.

I'm new to bread machining and have tried about 10 recipes in 2 months. 3 loaves have gone straight into the trash they were so thick and flavors weren't right. THIS recipe, really is fluffy. I live in Colorado and the top sunk but it was still good. I will make this many more times.

The best bread maker bread ever!  I make it weekly-- The best part,  you can't even tell it's from a bread maker. I use sugar instead of honey, cause I'm cheap and  add 2 1/2 cups of flour v 2, which gives it more volume.

Well, I’m not the only one who had problems. I’ve been baking bread successfully for years. I made this twice, both times it fell miserably. The yeast blooms perfectly. I even doubled the salt and it still fell. I’m going to try one more time with at least 3 C. of flour, maybe 4 C. and possibly an egg. The bottom half, which was baked nicely, had a crusty exterior and beautiful even holes as promised. The flavor and texture make it similar to ciabatta. I’m giving it 4 stars due to the half that was baked well being quite tasty.

This recipe needs more flour. I did this recipe as instructions said, and their were crust surrounded it. However, the inside was really gooie! I even had done bread machine cycle, and added more time to cycle.

I didn't care for this recipe. The instructions and ingredients were spot on. But, I made it twice as written and it didn't work for me. The first time, I ended up with slop and the second time, a loaf of mediocre bread that fell. I even tried to add some flour the first time. Maybe it was my machine. Who knows. I made another recipe from another site and it was perfect for me. It called for a cup of water, 2 tsp yeast, 3 tbsp sugar, 1/4 cup oil, 3 cup flour, and a tsp salt. It was great.  Same directions. I am thinking I have a very different machine and maybe measuring cups from this recipe.

We bought a Glen bread maker last week. Tried the standard white bread recipe from their cook book, which produced an 'OK' loaf. Found this recipe and instantly decided to try it out because of its title: 'Softest soft bread...'

The end result is just PERFECT! Toasted or plain, it's as the author says, 'slice of heaven'. Thank you!

I added just under 1/4c wheat gluten.  However, the dough was very watery and I needed to add another full cup of flour during the mix cycle.  It still didn't rise very much at all, and the crust was not very good, but the inside....oh my delicious! My pickiest eater, my teen girl, loved the inside and she hates all my homemade breads lol reminded me of those crusty loaves you get at casual dining chains where the crust is too hard to eat but the inside is soft and airy.

This recipe totally worked in my Zojirushi Home Bakery Virtuoso Bread Machine! I made a minor alteration, I put three cups of flour instead of two since my machine size is bigger and it doesn't have different loaf sizes. The bread recipe I found from Zojirushi recipe book (BB-PAC20) didn't turn out right. Bread was dry. I love this recipe and thank you for sharing!!

My husband wanted a bread recipe that was light with a crispy top. This was exactly what he wanted. It made a small loaf but had a great texture and taste. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this exactly like the recipe and it did not rise in my machine it was a small flat loaf of bread. The taste was amazing but not to pretty.  I am trying it again with bread flour this time to see if I can get a better rise. Any one have any suggestions as to why it came out flat? Never had this to happen in my machine before.

Small loaf but very squishy and tasty.  I don't love the olive oil flavor and would personally prefer it with butter or a more neutral oil.  It looked too wet while it was cooking but it came out well.  
Seriously don't slice it till it's cool or it will fall apart.

I just made this bread twice with fast rising yeast and the rapid bread machine setting.  It makes a big gorgeous loaf, much better than the quick yeast usually produces.  I do have to add more flour, though--about1/3 cup or the loaf is too wet and falls in the center.

Made tonight. Everyone loved it. Only thing I changed was instead of all water for the liquid I put half milk..  Otherwise, just the right amount of sweetness,  definitely will be my "go to" bread recipe!!

Made this recipe in my bread machine, used 25% less yeast as I do with all recipes and used 1 lb setting.  The loaf still fell a bit when baking but otherwise made a very light, slightly chewy loaf, not too sweet or salty.  A great everyday bread recipe.

This recipe was a complete failure. I weigh all of my ingredients while baking since measuring flour by the cup can be very inaccurate. I followed this recipe to the letter and even tried it twice thinking maybe I didn't do something right the first time. The dough was more of a liquid batter that couldn't even rise. I think the writer of the recipe must have been measuring the ingredients by the cup instead of the true weight, so there is meant to be more than two true cups of flour in it.

This recipe is so easy! I love that there are very few ingredients required. I didnt have oil so i used equal amount of Margerine instead (in the 4 corners of the pan) and it turned out perfect! This is officially my go-to recipe
