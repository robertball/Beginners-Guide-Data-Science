Pretty good, but with a little tweaking it was GREAT!  We cut down on the sugar and increased the water so they were equal parts of 1.5 cups (your basic simple syrup recipe), and added TWO packets of drink mix.  This really kicked up the flavor, so when you pour it over your snowcone it doesn't taste "watered down".  Thanks for the recipe - I'm now the most popular Mom on our street!  :)

I have worked in a snow ball stand, which is what we called snow cone stands in New Orleans. This is the recipie they all use. Also you can use this for Italian soda. Just add a shot glass of the syrup to soda water and cream. Also if you want a vanilla or amaretto flavor omit the koolaide and add extract according to strength.

PERFECT  syrup for snow cones.  It's super easy and is inexpensive so having a bunch of flavors on hand is doable!  If you need to cool it off fast stick it in the freezer.

**UPDATE!!**  my kids LOVE bubblegum and cotton candy flavors, but they're not available in Kool-Aid.  SO I used a teaspoon (1 dram) of LorAnn candy flavoring oil, and voila!!

This syrup is fabulously sweet, and just as nutritionally worthless as all of my other favorite childhood treats!  I added my Kool Aid a little early which worked out well because it was a little lumpy, so the heat took care of that.  Add a little lemon juice if you like yours to give you a little pucker...

I tried this tonight and the more sugar, the better it is, although not the healthier. I used 2 cups sugar and a little over a cup water and 1 pk koolaid! This is much better than the syrup sold at walmart that taste like soap! Now I can make any flavor I want!!

This is so much better than store bought syrup and cheaper to! I made this 7 times this summer with different flavors. I used water bottles with the sport tops worked great. I also made this with sugar free drink mix and it worked out really good with no sugar! The hawaiian punch and pink lemonade was my favorite.

We keep this in a sports waterbottle (with the special nozzle on top) and it keeps for months!  I'm still playing with how thick I like it.  This is relatively thick as written (though still fabulous!)

This recipie was a HIT! Everyone admitted, adults as well as kids, that these snow cones were better than ANY they've ever had including fairs & Louisianna Snowballs! I followed the advice of other posters.  First I cut back the sugar to 1 1/2c. & increased the water to 1 1/2 c.  I used 2 packages of drink mix for more flavor.  We also added lemon juice because we don't like things too sweet.  I used dehydrated cane juice in place of refined white sugar which didn't affect the flavor at all.  In one flavor I used the kool aid "clear" w/no artificial colors.  It was the Watermelon-Kiwi flavor.  I then colored it w/a little beet juice.  This flavor was voted best among everyone who ate our snow cones!  I will definately look for more of the Kool Aid "clear" since some of my kids are sensitive to artificial colors & frankly it's not good for any of us.  Next I'll try one poster's suggestion to use Loranne candy flavorings.  Thank you sooo much for a great recipie & great suggestions by others!

I use frozen juice concentrate, which you can dilute with water or simply use straight. No need to add sugar. It's already in the fruit!!!

Yum!! My son has a stomach bug and can't keep anything down. The pediatrician recommended pedialyte freezer pops but he's too young to hold the popsicle. I used the powder pedialyte and truvia. Perfect snowcone that he can actually enjoy without losing it :)

I looked up this recipe after buying a Sunbeam snow cone maker machine at Target. I bought the sugar free syrups that they sold and they tasted horrible, so I thought it would be better to make my own. There are many variations and it takes a bit of practice to make it just right for your taste, but it is well worth it. 

Here are several ways that I made it... 

1) With Splenda instead of sugar. Notes: Turns out VERY sweet so use a minimum of 1 part water to 1 part Splenda. You can then add the Kool Aid for a lower calorie syrup! Works great. 

2) With 2 cups water, 2 cups sugar and 1 packet of Kool Aid. Notes: Delicious. Perfect for my taste. 

3) With 2 cups water, 2 cups sugar or Splenda and then lemon and lime juice (instead of Kool Aid). Notes: You need at least a half cup of lemon and/or lime juice, otherwise it tastes too sugary. My tip is to add the juice a quarter cup at a time until it's right. 

Another tip is to store them in those plastic "picnic" bottles that you would serve ketchup or mustard in. You can get them in red and yellow at the dollar store or you can get them in clear at a restaurant supply store.

This syrup was perfect. I also attempted to make it with less sugar, by using a sugar-free drink mix, and only used 1 cup of sugar. No one knew the difference :)

My son is allergic to anything artificial. So snow cones have never been doable for him. After seeing this recipe I realized I could make an all natural version. I skinned and cubed a fresh peach, pureed it and then used the measurements for the rest of the recipe and followed the same directions. 1 peach is plenty. Jarred this and brought it to our church function that serves snow cones. I poured it over and you would never have known the difference BUT better flavor! Plus the color is all natural and it really was delicious. Other kids were asking for mine instead of the fake stuff.

This syrup is better than store bought! And so easy to make! I put the syrup in glass bottles and in the freezer for a few minutes to quickly cool it, then I put it into well-washed dish soap bottles- they are great squeezy bottles! Thank you BONNIE544!

Exactly what I was looking for! I was tired of trying the expensive sno cone syrups only to find they were super sweet used HF corn syrup as a sweetener and really had no flavor.  Thanks to CUTEUTE I also got the idea to try the rootbeer concentrate I had on the shelf I used 1 1/4 tsp.  This leaves the window wide open for flavor options. Best of all it saves money. :)

DELICIOUS!  Just as good (if not BETTER) than the ones you get at the carnivals and fairs.  My daughter got a snow cone machine for her birthday and it did NOT come with the syrup, so I was desperately hunting for a syrup recipe.  We are 100% pleased with this recipe.  It is so easy to make.  Only requires sugar, water, and your choice of drink mix flavoring.  A huge hit with my kids!  We will have fun trying new flavors each time we make it.  5 stars!

I came across this recipe by accident. I was going to order syrup and found this while doing a search. This recipe was excellent. My girls loved it. We also put it in a water bottle with a squirt top which worked great! We will definitely be making this again and again!

I made mine per a review which was 1-1/2 cup water, 1-1/2 cup sugar and 2 packets of unsweeted "koolaid". This was absolutely perfect for me and I think two cups of syrup to 1 cup of water would have been too sweet for us. This combination was absolutely perfect!

Great, easy, fast recipe. I only put a half cup of water to start. I put one cup sugar and half cup water in the microwave for two minutes, stirred, and put it on another 35 seconds, or just until the solution was clear. Then, I added lots of ice cubes until it was cool, and these ice cubes made up for the half cup I did not put in in the beginning. Within five minutes, we had yummy snow cones!

Wowza!  So easy, my 10 yr old son made it for us.  He tripled the recipe but added one less cup sugar in all.  It's perfectly thick and very flavorful.  We made slushees with it in the blender.  Delicious!  I stored the tripled recipe in 3 pint sized canning jars in the fridge but 10 minutes in a water bath canner, right after making it, will keep it for a few years on your shelf.

Love this!  My daughter and her friend were running a sno cone stand and trying to figure out how to get their costs down.  This was a perfect alternative to store bought syrup, and it tastes great.  We just saved the used bottles and refilled them with our homemade syrup.

Perfect!  I went with 1.5 C sugar to 1.5 C water and two packets of koolaid.  It was perfect and you will not see me buying the nasty  the stores sell ever again.  I just put it in a water bottle with a regular top, was simple to drizzle on.  Gonna make more flavors tomorrow!  Thanks!!!

This was great and easy. However, I only need it about half the strength to make slushies or snow cones.

Since the day I bought my snow cone maker I have been unable to find snow cone syrup in the store.  This is great.  My niece and nephew took my snow cone maker and several batches of this flavored differently and sold snow cones at a neighbors yard sale.  They made more money than she did....Thanks

Great snow cone syrup, and it makes a good amount as well, one batch is enough to do over 20 small snow cones.  It's quick too, the sugar/ water boils very quick.

I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups and increased the water to 1.5 cups.  I thought this recipe turned out great and the kids loved it.  I won't be buying bottled syrup again!

I am in the middle of a kitchen remodel so my budget is cramped just like my house.  I have only a microwave to work with and so I heated the sugar and water in a microwave safe bowl for 4 minutes and then added the packet of koolaid.  It was perfect.  I am now going to be able to keep the kids cool and happy all cramped summer long.  Thank you for posting this recipe, you have brought this family of seven a little piece of joy.

A regular simple syrup is a 1:1 ratio of sugar to water.  Doubling the sugar makes for a too sweet syrup, in my opinion.  I use a regular simple syrup and then fruit juice instead of KoolAid (white-grape-peach is really tasty).  It makes me feel just a tad better giving it to my kiddos, even though they're still getting sugar-water-juice!

I also tweaked the formula as indicated by the member sahm2nick.  She calls for 1 1/2 cups water, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 2 packets of your favorite flavoring (I used Flavor-aid).   I took it a step further, not wanting all that sugar, and used 3/4 cup of sugar and used splenda for the other 3/4 cup of sugar.   Remember, one packet of splenda equals two teaspoons of sugar.   So to get to 3/4 cup of equivolent sugar is 18 packets (equals 36 teaspoons, which is equal to a 3/4 cup).    You will get only 35-45 calories in a small to medium size snow cone, versus 70-90 calories if you use just regular sugar.  No aftertaste either, since you are using regular sugar in it as well.  It's a perfect balance.

I made this for a neighborhood pool party. I put about 8 lbs of sugar into a clean empty gallon jug, added 8 cups of water and 8 Kool Aid packets. Wonderful!! I used condiment containers with the pointed tips (store-bought empty) for easy dispensing.

Even better you can make the cream topping version with chilled Eagle Brand milk. Drizzle on top and your done and it did not cost .50C extra per serving

This was fast but quite yucky tasting. The sugar didn't cook long enough to disolve. The finished product was thick and cloudy and did not pour well and distribute through the ice like it should. It was WAY too sweet even for children. Sorry :(

I could not find flavoring during winter when I found machine on clearance. I made the blue Koolaid and it turned out great, I did use equal parts water and sugar. I am making some again and going to try it as a mixer in some adult Fish Bowl drinks. possibilities endless.

What a great recipe! it is easy to make and stores for a long time! I like to use it for my sno cone stands in the summer and for parties. It isn't too sweet and you have such a variety of flavors. I tried pink lemonade kool-aid with 1c sugar and 1/2c water because i didn't need much, but now i know to make a full batch, maybe even more! I would reccomend using Kool-aid or any other kind of unsweetened drink mix (there's a lot at Wal-mart) or using a sweetened drink mix and putting in a little bit of sugar and tasting until it fits your taste. You can also use extracts or what I did one time was put a tea bag in there. (worked a little, but you need a LOT of tea bags) I would recommend  this to anyone with a blender or a snow cone machine that needs some cheap and fast flavor. 5 stars!

This is so easy and so good!  I liked this better than the bottled syrup.  We used Kool Aid tropical punch which only cost 10 cents. I always have sugar on hand so it was nice to buy something to treat my family for 10 cents!  I can't wait to try different flavors!

Followed the receipe as is and my kids love it!  They agree the snow cones taste just the amusement parks! We did the math and it costs 34 cents for a bottle of home-made syrup versus $2.49 at the store!  Thanks for a great receipe and saving money!

Tasted good. Could really taste the sugar, but with snow cones that's not necessarily a bad thing. My husband wasn't thrilled about the consistency, but I'm not sure if he wanted it to be thicker or thinner? I'd make it again as it was cheap and easy though.

This is perfect! I changed nothing. We made snow cones for my daughter's bday. I made grape, lemon-lime, blue raspberry, cherry and strawberry syrup. I used this exact recipe for all of the flavors and everyone loved them! Yes, it seems like a lot of sugar but it's not something you should consume daily. It's a fun treat. If you use less sugar it's not going to taste as good as the usual snow cone.

Having kids with ADHD (& one allergies), we don't do artificial dyes. This is a great alternative when we allow them to have the occasional sweet treat. Instead of Kool Aid, I use 1-2 tsp colorless extract in lieu of the Kool Aid. Usually I divide the simple syrup evenly between two Pyrex dishes and add about 1/2 to 1 tsp extract/flavoring into each and then set aside to cool. Those looking for colorless or natural colored flavorings, many professional cake/candy supply shoppes carry a few. Also, check out the artisan line with Amoretti (Whole Foods uses those in their bake shop); I LOVE the Amoretti flavorings! http://www.amoretti.com/amoretti_artisan_natural_flavors/Artisan%20Natural%20Flavors/30/1

Love this recipe, but it is way too sweet! Next time I'll cut down on the sugar and make sure it's cold before I try to pour it over ice! Definitely a keeper - now I just have to find a pourable storage solution!

Yummy!  My daughter got a snow cone machine for her B-Day and wanted to make one right away.  Of course I didn't think to buy syrup so I threw this recipe together and the kids loved it!  Now I'm going to buy some of those plastic syrup bottles and keep a few different flavors in the fridge all summer long!

I followed the recipe with no changes. Although the flavor was ok, the syrup was too thick. When I poured it over the shaved ice, it just sat on top. It was too thick to soak in.  I found another recipe that is very similar that doesn’t require any cooking.  I’m going to give that one a try. It may take longer to dissolve the sugar, but hopefully the texture will be better.

I order snow cone syrup online. I wanted to save money by making my own. I didn't like it. It's too thick. I will continue to order snow cone syrup online.

This is the perfect recipe to make syrup for Italian sodas!! Make it up, store in fridge and mix with club soda for a perfect, light drink!! Nice way to control the sweetness and if you're looking for more "adult" flavors, head to your local Mexican grocery store where they have pineapple, mango and hibiscus flavored drink mixes. Yum!!

This is absolutely fabulous, taste great, many many flavors of kool aid to choose from, and a whole lot cheaper & better than the syrups in the store. And we strongly suggest peach/mango kool aid, makes the GREATEST snocone/shaved ice/slushi !!

I took another reviewers advice and made a simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar) brought to a boil as directed in the recipe and added 2 packets of koolaid. The 2 packets of koolaid gave it a very funny taste. Will stick with the simple syrup and 1 packet of koolaid from now on. Perfect.

I was so glad to find this recipe. Now we can make all different flavors without a huge expense. My kids love tropical punch and pineapple best. I pour the rest in water bottles and keep in refrigerator.
