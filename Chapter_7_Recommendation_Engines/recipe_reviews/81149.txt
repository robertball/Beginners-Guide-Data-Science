I had this several times when I went to Chile last year & it is my favorite desert. It is very sweet but I serve it (because it had been served 1 time in Chile this way) with fresh rasberries. I find that the tartness of the rasberries really balances out the sweetness. It tasted just like the one I had there made at a friends house. Thank you so much I had been unable to find the recipe in English!!

WHOA! "Painfully sweet" is about right! left me feeling a bit sick. We goofed the meringue and had to leave it off... maybe that would've cut some of the sweetness, but I'm not thinking so. It would be an excellent dip for fruit or maybe something salty.

I have a sweet tooth but this dessert is almost too sweet.  It was good though and not difficult to make.  I served it in espresso cups and found that the meringue topping was too much. (I baked the extra meringue in the oven.)  I might do the custard part only for a ice-cream sauce or a fruit dip.
