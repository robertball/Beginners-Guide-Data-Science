My family really enjoyed this dish.  I thought that the sour cream and Parmesan cheese added to the flavor.

Forget the kids, WE adults loved this recipe...lol   We didn't use american cheese slices tho, but used a pound of Cheddar shredded cheese.  Also, try some sauteed onions instead of garlic powder.  We could eat this at least twice a week!

My family loves this dish!!!  I cook the onions, garlic and onion soup mix with the hamburger.  It adds a ton of flavour!  I also put in a can peas to help with the vegetable intake :)

Made this, with a few slight changes based on previous reviews. I added a bit of extra onion and some minced garlic with the meat while cooking, and a dash of garlic salt .  I added a total of 1c  milk due to the reviews about it being dry. I used shredded cheddar instead of velveeta because it is what I had on hand. It came out delicious and we enjoyed it.

Very tasty! Would just recommend to saute the onions with the ground beef too. Otherwise, they are crunchy.

I thought this was pretty good - tastes like homemade hamburger helper. I didnt add the crackers on the top and it still turned out good. Will make again.

Very simple, and hearty meal. I made it exactly per instructions minus the cheese slices on top, was very good. Could use more seasoning, or Tabasco?

I will make again. I used the Velveeta cheese sauce instead of the solid velveeta and it mixed in really well. I also cut it down to 6 servings, and a 9x13 baking dish was the appropriate size. And instead of adding the onions to the cheese soup mixture, I added them and cooked them in with the meat a bit (as well as a dash of Tony Chachere's seasoning). I also substituted some of the crushed ritz crackers for seasoned bread crumbs to sprinkle on top, and substituded shredded cheddar cheese in place of the American cheese slices (which I'm not really a fan of).

This was a great comfort food meal. We followed the recipe except we sauted the onions because I don't do well with crunchy onion. Excellent!

Made this for the family and they loved it!  I will add a little more seasoning next time for some kick, but otherwise it was a great dinner.

I did some substitutes for this recipe.  I used beef/onion soup mix, minced garlic, ground pepper and cooked the onions with the burger.

This was very good. I used venison hamburger. A little on the dry side. Next time I'll add more milk.

We loved it, including our 21 year old picky son. I'll make it again. I used old cheddar instead of process cheese, and used crushed garlic and saut√©ed onions in it instead of the garlic and onion powder. Yummy.

I followed all the directions for this recipe and it turned out very dry. I cooked it just as long as it stated. What do you think went wrong.

Not bad flavor but too dry!  I will try with less Parmesan and add more milk and beef broth.

Sorry folks.  It was just too bland for our tastes.  I also think the cracker crumbs dried it out.  Was expecting something more creamy.
