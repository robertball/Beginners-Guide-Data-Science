Yum!  Used cinnamon-flavored graham crackers and subbed dried fruit for cherries.  Because it can be messy to mix, I crushed my graham crackers in a large plastic bag, then added dry ingredients and slowly added condensed milk (closing bag and mushing it up after each addition).  Clean hands, no dishes and still turned out delish! Thanks for sharing.

Made it once. Everyone ate it up so fast had to make another one to get through the holiday week.
