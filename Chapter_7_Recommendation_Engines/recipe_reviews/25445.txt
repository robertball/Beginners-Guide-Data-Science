Awesome!! I made this chicken last night on the grill, and it left me wanting more! After reading some of the reviews I did tweak this to my liking.  I prepared the marinade the night before.  I first started with 1 batch, and realizing how little it makes, so I decided to double the recipe.  I used all together 3 tbsp soy sauce, doubling calls for 6, so I cut in half, about 3 tbsp of honey, 2 tbsp oil, juice from 2 fresh limes(squeezed dry), 2 tsp of garlic, and chicken(I used chicken tenders).  Lowering the soy sauce and upping the honey and lime juice is key.  I can see how the soy could become a prominent flavor.  I marinated over night, turning once.  The next day I grilled on low, and the chicken came out tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The flavor was very well blended.  You could taste just a hint of everything. My family loved this.  There were no leftovers disappointingly.  The next time I will be sure to make a little extra marinade and set it aside.  This would be great to have on hand at dinner for an extra kick of flavor and juices. Also, I served this with the oven roasted potatoes from this site, and asparagus (which we put on the grill with the chicken). I topped everything off with some fresh parmesan and romano cheese.

This chicken was SO good! I managed to grill it perfectly, and it was very moist. I served it with cilantro lime rice, tropical fruit salad and a green salad.  What a great meal. Oh, and the chicken was even better the next day on toasted bread with melted cheese, deli mustard and sliced tomatoes (my husband's creation).  Thanks!

My husband & I loved the flavors of this dish!  The ingredients really blended well together, adding some sweetness to the dish.  I marinated the chicken overnight & then placed them in a tin foil-lined pan (with the marinade, and baked in a 350 degree preheated oven for 25 minutes.  I served it with steamed white rice, drizzled with the cooked sauce.  Next time I will definitely try them grilled!

Wonderful!  I read past reviews, added the juice of one lime and doubled the honey.  I didn't marinade it whatsoever (since this was a spur of the moment dinner).  What I did was used wings and legs, seasoned it with pepper, then placed it in a shallow baking dish, poured the marinade over them and baked them in the oven for about 45 mins (turning them every so often).  Served these with a medley of veggies and rice (which I ladled the marinade over).  Everyone loved it!

I marinaded this overnight and in the morning threw some shrimp in, too.  It was incredible!  Great taste and very tender chicken.

This is an easy and quick marinade that you are sure to enjoy.  Even my very picky husband thought this was delicious and we'll definitely make it again.  It went well with grilled potatoes and if anyone knows of another good side dish for this chicken, I would love the suggestion. I marinaded the chicken breasts for a little over 8 hours and after grilling them, they were so tender and had wonderful flavor.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe was boring and lacked the flavor I was expecting.  I made a few changes.  I upped the lime juice, lowered the soy sauce, used tenderloins instead of breasts and left it to marinade overnight.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either and it left my friend and I longing for more flavor.  I probably will not be making this again.

This is a great marinade. I added a healthy pinch of curry powder and some toasted seasame seeds and to it and marinaded some beef cubes overnight - best BBQ kebabs I have ever made!

This is a winner because it's simple, taste great and uses what you probably have sitting in your kitchen cupboards to make. I only marinated my chicken for 30 min. and that was enough to add plenty of flavor. I can't wait to marinate my meat even longer next time.

This is an excellent recipe.  I would advise anyone who is making this to taste the marinade before continuing.  Everyone has different taste buds.  Doesn't mean anything is wrong with the basic recipe.  We all like things a little more sweet or sour or do not have recipe ingredients on hand, that's the mark of a good cook, to use what you have and make the recipe yours.  I did not have honey so used brown sugar, used less soy sauce, then added more to my taste.  This chicken was excellent.  Came out very moist and very tasty cooking on the bar be 5 mins on each side. I will definitely use this recipe again, wonderful succulent lime and sweet flavorl.

I actually used this marinade for boneless pork chops (4) and they were awesome!  Per the "most helpful" reviewer here, I doubled the marinade, but kept the soy sauce (reduced sodium) at 3 Tbsp.  I also added a few dashes of cayenne.  We like to boil the marinade and then baste the meat while grilling... keeps it moist and piles on even more flavor.

I prepared the marinade as is and tasted.  The flavor was very salty and didn't have a strong lime flavor.  I marinated two chicken breasts in the exact recipe marinade and made a second marinade based on suggestions from other reviewers.  The second marinade I used 3 tbsp. soy, 3 tbsp. honey, 2 tbsp. veg oil., 4 tbsp. lime juice, & 2 tsp. chopped garlic.  I marinated the remaining two breasts in the revised marinade.   The revised recipe was by far better.  The original recipe had a very strong soy flavor that overwhelmed the other flavors.  The revised recipe was much more complex.  I could taste the soy, the sweetness of the honey with the bright citrus flavor of the lime.    As the recipe is I would rate it a two.  The adapted recipe I prepared I would give a 4-5.

Side note on grilling chicken. Why does ANYONE suggest grilling breasts when you can use thighs/legs? So much more flavor. This and any chicken grill marinade could use a sprinkling of chili flakes. Dash of vinegar to get the sweet/hot/sour number going!

This is a great recipe! I doubled the marinade,left the chicken in for about 4 hrs.and it was moist and delicious. I had to bake it instead of grilling because of a thunderstorm and it turned out fine. I used a foil lined pan and poured the marinade over it and baked at 350 for 30 mins. basting with the sauce while cooking.

This marinade was GREAT!  I made it ahead and marinated it for two days.  My mom was visiting and I wanted to spend time with her, not in the kitchen.  I placed the chicken on my George Foreman with some summer squash.  I also added rice pilaf to the meal and we both commented on its tastiness.  Definitely will enjoy again!

I doubled the recipe and used Tbsp instead of tsp lime juice, placed chicken in a 1-gallon ziplock bag and marinated for only 1 hour, grilled the chicken until just done. 
It was a real hit. I expected it to be more citrus/sweet instead of soy sauce/garlic; however, I have no complaints. Make very sure you do not overcook chicken or I can see how it may ruin it. Would be good with a medley of steamed veggies and Hawaiin bread.

All in all, tummies were satisfied at Mamma's table.

I liked this marinade, but I just thought by the name and the lime juice it would have been a bit more citrus tasting.  All I really tasted was soy sauce & garlic.  May make again and use more lemon or lime juice.  Would highly recommend if you are looking for a great basic soy sauce marinade.

O M G !!!  I made this last night.  This was by far the best chicken recipe I have found yet.  I doubled the honey and garlic and used 2 whole limes.  It was to die for.  It is such a light sauce.  My grill ran out of gas while heating up so I grilled in a pan on the stove.  And I didn't discard that great sauce after marinading.  I continued to brush it on while cooking and during the last few minutes of cooking I poured the rest in the pan.  I am making it again tonight since half my family missed dinner last night.

If could give this a 4.5 stars I would - this was very good and very easy for a cooking novice like me.  I served with rice and with the extra left over marinade - I boiled this in the dish in the microwave and poured over the rice and chicken - overall - excellent - think I will add a touch more honey and a teaspoon of ginger to give it a little more bite. Highly recommended.

I made this for a recent BBQ and my guests liked it.  It adds just a touch of flavor and makes the chicken very tender and delicious.  It is easy to make; I marinated it overnight.

I followed the directions exactly. It was a wonderful meal! I wanted Surf & Turf, so I actually made two batches of the marinade. Used one for chicken and one for shrimp. I think I liked the shrimp even better than the chicken (don't get me wrong, though, the chicken was phenomenal).   Even my husband, who doesn't like shrimp, liked this shrimp. This is a recipe we'll definitely make again.

Every one liked the taste.  Used juice from 2 limes, used the same amt of soy sauce but doubled every thing else.  Hint of lime taste came thru with 4 hrs marinated.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would!  I served this for Father's Day and everyone raved about it.  I followed the ingredients for the marinade exactly, but doubled them.  The chicken marinated for 2 or 3 hours and was incredibly moist, tender and flavorful.  The next day, I used the leftovers to make chicken salad and it was the best I've ever had.  I finely chopped the leftover chicken, along with some sweet onion, then added a little mayo, a squeeze of lime and some ground black pepper.  Served on a toasted bun with tomato and lettuce, it was perfect!  Key West Chicken salad, who knew?  Thanks, Tina, for a great recipe!

I found this to be rather bland and I marinated it all night. I was expecting a more citrucy flavor. My teens were really dissapointed in this one. I tried to modify it a second time and no good then either. I prefer a more standout marinade flavor, too mellow for me and the kids. Good if you like a soy, honey flavor. Not a keeper for me though.

I also doubled the ingredients.  I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours, it
was worth it!  My entire family loved it, and the chicken was so tender and juicy
right from the grill.  Definately a keeper!

I thought this was amazing.I have to admit that I am not a big fan of soy sauce so I only used two tablespoons and upped the honey and oil and lime.It had a wonderful char taste similar to a perfectly cooked steak.Doing it again today!!! Thanx

Great flavor. I'd only suggest halving the chicken breasts or cutting them in strips to get more sauce coverage.

Both my hubs and I did not care for this at all (sorry!). For one, we could barely taste any hint of lime. I guess if we had marinated our chicken longer than 1 1/2 hours, it might have made a difference (or maybe not...). As the title implies, I was expecting a vibrant, tropical / limey taste. What I ended up with was bland, dry chicken. Key lime pie has more of a "tropical" vibe than this does.... Another observation I have to share has to do with the suggested grilling temperature / timeframe. I NEVER cook my chicken over high heat, especially not for 6-8 minutes per side (ikes!). Cook over medium-high heat and watch VERY carefully!!! It didn't occur to my husband to do so and our chicken was BURNT! Luckily, after flipping our chicken, he realized that it was cooking too fast and adjusted accordingly (he was able to save our dinner from turning into inedible birquettes). Maybe this will float your boat, but it did noting for us. Chicken marinated in plain 'ol Italian dressing is better than this. Thanks anyways, Tina.

I marinated this for several hours. It was moist but not particularly full of flavor. I think I will increase the amount of lime next time, maybe try using some zest.

This is a good recipe, but it needs to marinate for as long as possible.  The shorter time doesn't really allow for max flavor.

Very good. I cut up the chicken in smaller pieces and sauted on the stove.  Served over rice with a side of green beans. My husband and I both loved it. I think next time I will make up a little extra sauce for the rice.

My husband loved this recipe.  The chicken had really good flavor and we only marinated it for a half hour.  All the ingredients we had in the house which made it really convenient.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

O.K. Read other reviews and changed it up. Decreased soy to 1 tbsp., honey increased to 3 tbsp., juice of one lime instead of a tsp., zest of half a lime, 1/2 tsp. sesame oil, left out the garlic. It was fantastic. I know I really changed it up, but it was a great base recipe which was what I was looking for. I used chicken tenderloins. The family loved it.

Took the hint from other reviewers and lowered the soy content and upped the honey and lime. I also added some lime zest which gave extra zing without overpowering the other flavours. Utterly delicious, and will be a mainstay in our house. Served it with basmati rice and avocado feta salsa, also from this site.

Great!  A side note - marinate= the act of soaking meat in a seasoning mixture AND marinade=the seasoning mixture in which one marinates meat.

I marinated it for 24 hours.  I think that was a little too long. Everybody loved it.  The flavors really soaked in and the grilling added to it.  Don't know if it would be as good if it were baked.

Delish!  I took the advice of some reviewers and doubled everything except the soy sauce.  I put the chicken in the marinade in the morning and grilled it for lunch.  So flavorful - the perfect mix of flavors and it was so tender.  I usually dry chicken out, so I tried grilling it slow and it was the best chicken I've ever made on the grill.  Yum, yum, yum.  We'll be having this over and over because it's so simple and so yummy!

My husband and I really loved this recipe.  The only change I made was I used the juice of a whole lime (about 4 or 5 tsp) and I baked it with the marinade at 350º for about 30 minutes, flipping the chicken half way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, went over really well with company.  I added more garlic then what the recipe suggested (we are garlic lovers here).  I only marinade it for 4 hours in a vacuumed sealed bag (cuts marinating time down).  Should have let it sit a couple more hours.  Maybe even over night.  Still had wonderful flavor.  Served over white rice.  I also made up an extra amount of the marinade and cooked it on the stove until boiling.  Then served over the chicken and rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this exactly as listed (I marinated it all day)& it was absolutely the BEST, most moist & flavorful chicken I've ever grilled. It was a HUGE hit with everyone at the table. Next time I'll grill additional chicken so there's leftovers, it'd make KILLER chicken sandwiches!

we used this marinade for shish-ke-bobs, and it was wonderful. In truth, the beef actually took to it better than the chicken! All was wonderfully moist with just a hint of flavor. I marinated overnight.

I used this marinade with half a chicken and grilled it by indirect method on a gas grill - delicious!  I doubled the ingredients and marinated overnight. very tasty.

This recipe was amazing! I did it in the oven for 35 min cause the chicken was pretty fat. I made Brussels spouts with it baked in the oven at 350 for about an hour.  I posted a photo of what the meal looked like. My husband loved it. I will be making this again! Thank you!

I loved this, I just wish I owned a grill because I am sure that would just enhance the flavor even more so! We did cook these on a George Foreman and they still came out tasty, but once I get a grill I will definitely try this again. Thank you!

I'm sorry to say I didn't like this at all. I followed the recipe to a T, but it just had a very "off" flavor. There was no distinction between the flavors and the combination just didn't suit me.

First time I made this, I did not measure my garlic or my lime juice.  It was really good, but I gave it 4-stars in my own recipe box.  Made it tonight with garlic & lime as directed in the original recipe and it is, without a doubt, a 5-star recipe!

This immediately became a standard and have made it several times!  Love it grilled, but after marinating to grill last time I realized I had no gas for the grill.  I browned the breasts in olive oil & a little butter then spritzed bottom of a baking dish with a bit of soy sauce  (about a Tbsp.) and finished cooking in @350 oven for about 25 minutes (covered).  It was excellent!  
IF there is any leftover, I slice thin and use it in quesadillas. It freezes nicely for this use later.

I always add more lime juice to this and honestly, I still find this to be bland.  I do use this recipe quite often however, because I top the chicken with a mango salsa (also from allrecipes.com).  The salsa seems to help bring out the marinade flavors a bit more and tastes quite good.

This sat in the bottom of my recipe box for a very long time. I thought it looked great and finally remembered it and had everything on hand to make it. I marinated it for 6 hourse instead of the discribed 30 minutes and it still lacked any flavor. I used chicken tenders breaded with panko and baked for 30 minutes. The kids at all their dinner and it was fine cut up in my salad but not something I would choose to sit down and eat as is

Made exactly as recipe called for. It did have a good taste and my chicken was moist. I personally would tweak it next time as I found it a tad bit too salty from the soy sauce. Couldn't detect lime at all. Will keep the recipe as my husband liked it, but will probably play around with the ingredients to suit my own tastes.

Good marinade.  Made it twice;.  The first time, as printed; for us it was too salty and did not impart enough "flavor."  The second time I used only 2 TBSP soy sauce, but doubled the honey, garlic, and the lime juice.  I also added a 1/4 tsp lime zest which lended a nice punch. We preferred the second version;  I like that the ingredients in this recipe are generally household staples, or at least are readily available!

The marinade wasn't as strong as I'd like it but it was still good. I marinated for 1 day and then threw it on the grill. Very juicy and nice, but would like more flavor. Everyone who ate it liked it.

We enjoy this dish.  I used maple syrup instead of honey, added more lime juice and only 2 table spoons of soy sauce.  I did it in the oven at 350C for 35 mins.   I will try it on the BBQ next time.  Thank you Tina.  Irene

I am making this this evening.  I am using Key Lime juice rather than regular lime juice.  I think that may make the difference that others didn't find to their liking.

I followed this recipe to the "T".  I was disappointed.  It marinated for 6 hours.  For us, it had a weird texture and wasn't all that flavorful.  If we make this again, it will be with more lime juice and salt. It did not have enough acid for us.

This is a good go-to recipe for everyday cooking.  I marinated my chicken over night.  It is a comparatively fast meal for a week night and a bonus is that it is healthy.  I doubled the recipe for two boneless, skinless chicken breast halves and two boneless, skinless thighs just to make sure I had enough marinade - I could have put in one or two more chicken breast halves (probably a total of 6 if I didn't put in the thighs) and there would have been enough marinade (with the recipe doubled).  The recipe tastes better with the breast in my opinion as it seemed a bit stong on the thighs, but my husband liked the thighs.

My husband like the chicken, but he ate a very doctored version of it.  When I followed the directions, the chicken seemed a bit sweet.  I added pepper, garlic powder and a little salt to rescue it.  I don't like having to add something to a recipe.  just my take.

Chicken came out very juicy and delicious!  I tripled the marinade ingredients except the soy, only doubled that, and used the juice from one lime on 6 breasts.  Husband said it was to die for!  Our new favorite chicken recipe!

A delicious, simple, perky marinade. I usually make a chicken marinade with a huge and varied ingredient list and my boyfriend said he liked this one the same or better - awesome! The proportions of the soy, honey, and lime are great: one flavor doesn't overpower any of the others. I thought without any peppers or bold flavors it may be bland, but something about the mix is very satisfying - the chicken was super tender too. This will now be my standard chicken marinade, thank you very much for sharing :)

I used the marinade for my bone in chicken thighs... I put them in my oven for about 1  hour with the marinade.  I squeezed more lime juice before serving... Very moist.. I will try this on the grill during the summertime!

I doubled the recipe and used a bit more garlic. Marinated for 8 hours, and grilled on the bbq. This was tender, moist and delicious. Really reminds you of a good teriyaki sauce. Will definitely make again. This was really tasty served with jasmine rice & peas. I wish I had made extra marinade and set it aside, for dipping and for pouring on the rice. Keep that in mind for next time!

I doubled everything in the recipe to have more marinade for the chicken. I also cooked the chicken 3 mins. more per side because of the thickness of the chicken breast. It was outstanding. The chicken was both flavorful and juicy.  I will definitely do this again, though I will let it marinate over night the next time to bring out the flavor that much more.

Yesterday was my boyfriend's turn to make dinner and this was the recipe that he chose off of the website. I have to say, I was extremely impressed! It was very simple to make, tasted INCREDIBLE, and was very juicy. I will definitely be asking him to make this again! ;) Thanks for the recipe!

This was a wonderful chicken recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing.  It was quick, easy, and delicious.  I had all the ingredients on hand already and it takes minutes to stir the marinade together.  I marinated for about 45 minutes and the flavor was wonderful.  The chicken cooked on low heat on the grill and came out extremely tender and juicy.  My husband gave this two thumbs up as well.  I will definitely make this again, and often!

From prep time to dinner, the whole process was about an hour - great for those who work. As a novice griller, the chicken stayed moist and my roommates and I loved it! We had stove top stuffing and corn with it - great summer meal!

Was not crazy about the taste.  Mostly tasted the soy sauce and was too salty.

I think it could use a little more lime, or a longer marinade time- but this was delicious! I cooked this and it was delicious!

I tried this tonight and enjoyed it. It is a simple recipe and very easy to prepare and the chicken tasted great grilled. However, I would lower the amount of soy sauce next time. It was the most dominant flavor, and the other flavors (lime, honey) came out only subtly. I did add some paprika and upped the lime to 2 teaspoons, so I think that helped. I would love to try it with more honey next time. Overall this is a great easy recipe if you want to add some flavor to chicken breast.

This was a really delicious marinade. Thanks for sharing it. I don't typically follow measurements, and I know I used more of everything than the recipe called for. I marinated it for the prescribed 30 minutes and it turned out very flavorful - no need to bother marinating overnight. Served with grilled garlic/olive oil/pepper-seasoned zucchini and yellow squash and everyone loved it. Great healthy dinner.

I will have the leftover chicken in a salad tomorrow for lunch!

Very yummy recipe. I added extra lime juice. I like to make extra marinade to add to the pan while cooking for a sauce to put over the top. Husband loved it he was surprised how tender and good a chicken breast could be.

Was not a fan of this at all. Requires so much soy sauce that it ends up drowning out the other flavors.

not bad but kinda plain, quite a light healthy recipe but you may want to make extra marinade to cook down and use as a dipping sauce or use some other dipping sauce I followed others suggestions and made the stronger marinade lots of extra lime ect but still not much flavor to it. All in all it was ok but needs a little flavor

Easy, delicious, a definite crowd-pleaser. I followed the recipe exactly. I did cut the chicken breasts in half so they'd cook through better on the stovetop, and poured all the extra marinade into the pan. That might have upped the flavor compared to a larger piece on a grill.

I made this as written and it was perfect! I marinated it for 24 hours. I grilled it until slightly pink. Then I put in on a baking sheet and covered it with tin foil. I let it finish cooking in the oven at 200 degrees for about 1 hour. This kept it soooo juicy and flavorful! I loved this! Just the right amount of sweet and savoury! I was so tempted to tweak it, but I didn't! It was perfect as is!

Yum!!!  Not having tried every marinade out there, perhaps I'm not the one to have the ultimate opinion here, but we really enjoyed this chicken.  Doubled the recipe, so used juice of one small lime, which was just a tad extra compared to the recipe once it was doubled.  Pounded the chicken breasts out in a plastic bag prior to grilling in order to produce a more even thickness for cooking purposes.  The chicken cooked up lovely on the grill, not charring overly before reaching a nice, just barely cooked, tender, fork-tender texture.  Only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes, but it still produced a nice flavor.  Will be curious to see how this recipe tastes after both marinating overnight, and freezing the chicken with the marinade in a freezer bag.  Also, garnish of toasted coconut?  Used grill wok to grill some onions, green peppers, and pineapple chunks on the side.  Served chicken and grilled pineapple-mixture alongside Tropical Salad with Pineapple Vinaigrette from this site (and my husband liked that as well, even knowing that we skipped the bacon!).  Also tried a tropical soup, but only two of us liked the soup.  The chicken and salad, though, were enough enjoyment for all!  Thanks, Tina B!  I've already catalogued this recipe in my cookbook.  I plan to make it often - both in the summer when grilling is the rage, and in the winter when I just need a sense of an island getaway for a moment (hey, I have a good bit of fun pretending..... life's more fun that way!)!

Yummy! I marinated these for around 3 hours and then cooked them on my cast iron grill pan. I boiled the marinade for a few minutes and served it on the side with extra limes. The chicken was juicy and delicious!

Delicious!! This was so simple to do and super yummy. I did up the amount of honey and lime as some others suggested. I also baked it instead of grilled, and did not marinate it at all. My parents and I all enjoyed and they both made remarks on how good it was. Thanks for sharing!! This one is definitely a keeper:)

It was ok, but family of 4 agreed we would "move on" and not keep as a favorite.  No sparkle on this one.  Yes, I could work it again and add some of my own ideas, but why bother.  We have noted as "tried" and we will find another recipe further on.

This recipe is amazing! I doubled the recipe for about 4 whole chicken breasts, and has marinade left to brush over the chicken while it grilled. The reviews that said this recipe was bland... try squeezing a little extra lime juice on your chicken before eating... it adds a little extra kick.

We loved the flavor of this chicken, so fresh! The amount of marinade here is perfect for a pound of breasts but I would double it next time and set aside half to drizzle over the chicken for serving. I served this with a Caribbean flavored rice and beans. Good stuff!

This was pretty darn good!  I have used this combination of marinades before, so I wasn't expecting anything I haven't already tasted.  However, this really did end up being different than anything I've tasted and it had a great flavor.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!!

Bland?  Let me tell you, I'm the first to say when something is bland and this is far from it?  Not real sure what some of these reviews did wrong!  I doubled the ingredients to baste while grilling, but then forgot to tell my husband!  Will do that for sure next time just for the added yumminess!

Very simple, very quick, great for a novice like myself. Even with only 30 minutes was very flavorful. Will make again.

Made recipe exactly as described, would opt for less soy sauce and more lime next time though. I picked it because of the lime and it was overpowered by the soy flavor.

This recipe is perfect as is!  Only thing I did different is I used 3 full sized breasts and pounded them thinner before grilling to help them cook quicker... I only marinated for 30 minutes and it was delicious! I am happy to have found this quick easy grilled chicken recipe!

We loved the flavors here ! I used 4 bone in, skin on thighs and doubled the sauce. Baked in a foil lined pan in the toaster oven for about an hour. I marinated these for 5 hours, chicken was moist and very flavorful. Will marinate overnight next time and grill ! Thanks for a great recipe, Tina !!!

This recipe was really bland. I also thought the soy sauce was a little overpowering. Even the presentation just looked like a plain chicken breast.  My husband didn't like it at all. :0/

A solid 5 star!  Made as written, but marinated for 7 hours.  The flavor was light and refreshing, and the chicken was very moist and tender.  Perfect for a light summer dinner.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Served with orzo and rice from this site.  And of course margaritas!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and doubled the honey, lime, and garlic. I ended up baking this in the oven at 375 for about 45 minute, and it turned out great that way. -Served it with roasted asparagus and white rice, drizzled with the marinade.

Very good! I marinated overnight. I didn't have any limes, so I used lime juice. Next time I will get real limes and use some zest, too. I cut down on the soy like others said to do, but I think I will leave as written next time, also. I had 3 large chix breasts, so I cut each one in half so the cooking time would be less.  It worked perfectly.  We both loved it!  Took less than 15 mins on the grill. We will be having this one a lot this summer!!

This recipe is really good!  I marinated the chicken breasts for 3 hours.  I was hoping to get more of a lime flavor so I think next time I'll double the lime juice.  Great kickoff to summer!

We really liked this.  It was very simple to throw together, and there was nothing overwhelming about the marinade.  I thought the soy sauce would be overpowering, but it really wasn't at all.  The chicken came out very moist, and was even good the next day leftover!  The ONLY thing I changed was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Everyone in the family loved this one.  We are all pretty much "chickened out", so I'm always looking for a new way to present this meat.  We did not grill out since, of course, it was raining, but I added a couple of drops of liquid smoke to the marinade and cooked on the indoor grill.  Really good!

Very good, and very easy to make. However, I expected more of a lime flavor. I served it with lime wedges so everyone could flavor it to their own taste. I also recommend marinating this for atleast 2-4 hours.......it will be worth it.

Excellent flavor.  I took the advice of others and doubled the marinade recipe but decreased the amount of soy sauce.  Let the chicken marinate in the fridge overnight.  After doing so, it was perfect.  Thanks for this winner, Tina.

This is a VERY good recipe, but if you'd like the real taste of Key West, try using Key Limes for the juice of lime in the recipe...it DOES have a very different taste from a regular lime... Good Job Tina B. for the recipe tho!!!!

I loved how quick this recipe was. It took no prep time at all and I only had enough time to marinate it for 30 minutes - it still turned out great! Nice and juicy. Thank you!

This recipe was delicious.  My family loved it.  I marinaded for about 2-3 hours.  I think it would be even better if it sat in the marinade all day or overnight.  I made it with boneless/skinless chicken breasts and thighs.  Very juicy and tender chicken.    We served this with grilled corn on the cob and the mango pineapple salad with mint from this site.  It was a perfect summer meal.

This is excellent!  I love the flavor of lime so I use a whole lime in the marinade, and let it sit in the fridge all day.  I also fillet my chicken so that it cooks quicker (kids are starving when we get home).  i use this plain, on salads, in tacos....it's wonderful cold as well.  Thanks!

After reading the other reviews I doubled the lime juice and marinated the chicken in a foodsaver bowl with a vacum on it to help the marinade permeate. Let sit for six hours then put on grill. It still came out a little mild but was good. Then I put a little salt on it and the salt killed the taste of the marinade.

This marinade was very good. I marinated almost 10 hours or so.  Besides the great flavor, I think grilling vs baking or broiling really adds to it.  I will use this recipe again for sure.

I think I over-marinated the chicken, ended up being about an hour and a half before I got it on the grill. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, but it was too salty. I quickly made Peanut Sauce I from this site to go with it and it saved the day.

Very tasty! I marinated it overnight and also added dried cilantro, Penzey's Trinidad seasoning, cumin, and pepper. Baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. I thought it could use a lot more lime juice.

I have made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe to the "t", using boneless, skinless breasts. The second time I made it, I realized last minute I didn't have lime! So I substituted lemon juice (and was skeptical), but it turned out great!! The lemon juice was not as noticeable as the lime, but it still gives a nice zest. 5 stars!

My son loved this chicken!  I did too because it's very simple and tastes great!  The flavor is mild, not really strong which is perfect for kids!  I did add an extra TBS of honey and a little more lime juice than it called for since so many people thought the recipe was too salty.  It turned out perfect!  I may even add a little more honey next time, but it was great the way I made it this time!  This will be on our regular rotation!!

Reduced amount of soya  as per another person's suggestion- butI found it to be too tart as a result (lime). Marinated overnight & brought to a party to be served over white rice. Added sliced cooked zucchini, red peppers. Doubled the marinade, thickened it up and served over rice/chicken. Someone had suggested using the marinade the fresh chicken had been in for the sauce - don't think that is too safe.  Overall, the people at the party loved the dish.

Delicious!  I took the advice of others here and used the juice from one lime, about 2.5 tbsp of soy and baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  I want to try it on the grill next.

This marinade has a wonderful aroma. I knew it was going to be good when I mixed the ingredients together. I baked instead of grilled like some of the other reviewers and it turned out great.

This chicken was "okay."  I used the exact ingredients and it seemed a bit bland.  I used breasts that where cut thin and I marinated them for about 6 hours.  My family could not tell if there was honey or lime.  I would imagine if you doubled the marinade and let it sit overnight, it would be much better.  The ingredients do seem great for chicken.  I will try it again because we grill a lot here in Florida.

This was really good. I marinated for a few hours then grilled it. Came out fantastic. I added a little more lime than it called for though. Will make again!

This is my go to recipe when we have company, and it always gets rave reviews.  I add more lime juice, the juice of 3 limes, then after I juice them, I throw the limes in with the marinade to impart as much flavor as possible.  I also add lots of jalapeno lime seasoning and cilantro into the marinade.

We really enjoyed the chicken breast in this marinade.  I did let them marinade 24 hours before grilling.  The flavor is very good, but the next time I'm going to up the lime juice, just a little.  We did squeeze fresh limes slices over the chicken before eating.  A nice change for a grilled chicken.

Possible that I did something wrong, but I followed the directions and marinated it for 2 full days.  For some reason, I did not get a great deal of flavor.

This grilled chicken is a favorite of mine.  I have served it at many church functions and I always have someone  asking me for the recipe.  This works best with large plump chicken breasts.  Allow the marinade to soak in for at least 12 to 18 hours.  Cook over medium heat and you're good to go

I had six chicken breast halves, so I doubled the marinade, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I let the chicken marinate for a couple hours. I thought it was good, not great, but my husband didn't like it all. I probably won't make it again.

Fabulous! Made this as explained but took Melissa and Adam's advice and doubled the marinade then took Melissa P's advice and threw in some peeled tiger prawns too. Marinaded for 4+ hours.  Grilled 5+ minutes to a side on a medium grill. Fantastic! The chicken was juicy and nicely caramelized. My wife thought the prawns were to die for! It was a blazingly hot day so I served Cold Corn Salad and Cilantro Lime Rice on the side, all very popular with the wife and teen age kids.

This chicken is delicious and a quick solution to a weeknight meal.  I grill it alongside pineapple which I soak in the same marinade and everyone loves it.  I also make it ahead and eat it on a salad the next day.  Overall a great recipe that I will make again and again.

This was pretty good, though we thought that the soy sauce completely over shadowed the lime flavor.  My husband said that he thought it tasted more like terriyaki.  Next time, I'll add more lime to the mix and maybe just a touch more honey.  All and all, it was tasty and went over well with my family.

I used this chicken recipe over a taco salad, for a large dinner group last night.  I layered the salad in a trifle bowl with: tri-colored tortilla strips on top, black beans, corn, Chopped tomatoes, quartered & seeded cucumber slices, Mexican cheese, lime wedges (garnish), avocado slices.

I made taco bowls by putting 10-inch flour tortillas over soup cans in the oven, on a baking sheet, baking @ 400 for 10 min, then letting cool completely so they retain their shape.

I had the salad again tonight for dinner, trying the chicken on its own w/ the vinagrette dressing… super yummy!  (I had cooked the chicken on a grill pan and then cut it into strips to serve with the salad.  With the taco salad, I also served taco-seasoned ground beef and had a bottle of Catalina dressing on hand, so people could go “old school” with their taco salad, if they wanted to do so, instead of using the chicken and lime-cilantro vinagrette.  (The Catalina bottle never got opened, though...)

The only change I made to the lime-cilantro dressing was to add a dash of chipotle chili powder and a dash of cumin.

Lime-cilantro-vinaigrette

I think this Key West chicken and a little of the lime-cilantro dressing drizzled over it could be pretty versatile together, even in different dishes.

This was wayyyy ok much soy,  and not much to balance it. I increased the lime juice to more than a tablespoon,  from one whole lime.  I am not even sure about how to improve this, but either use a fraction of the soy, and a ton more citrus juice, or a different recipe. Sorry, this is not a winner.

This was delicious,but with changes,so I can't give it more stars. Use only 2 tablespoons of soy,more lemon and more honey(basically equivelent amounts for the 3) and it comes out perfectly.We marinated green beans in the same marinade. Enjoy !

Wow! So good! Definitely marinate and baste it!  Pound the skinless, boneless chicken breasts to an even thickness for grilling.  I used roasted garlic paste and lime flavored soy sauce. Delicious!

Made this yesterday and what a great recipe it was.  It almost tasted like blackened chicken somehow.  It was wonderful.  Husband and kids loved it too.

We use this marinade often for our grilled chicken breast, I can't believe I've never rated it. I use olive oil and fresh lime if I have it and a bit of zest too...of course fresh garlic cloves.

I tripled the lime juice and garlic, added some ground black pepper and used this as a marinade for chicken kabobs.  I marinated overnight - Delicious! Chicken was moist and tender, but not overwhelmed by the marinade flavors.

Tasty, but even after adding way more lime juice and reducing the soy sauce, the soy still overpowered other flavors.

I butterflied the breasts and marinated this overnight, but it really needed extra sauce for basting and serving.  I did not get much lime or "Key West" feel from it.

Very good taste, great marinade.  Only complaints are that it doesn't really taste as I would expect Key West Chicken to taste like.  The lime doesn't shine through.  Also, had to double the recipe for enough marinade to coat chicken well.  Great taste though!

This was great. Made after we both had a long day at work but I was able to get home a little earlier to get it marinating. SO easy-I used bone-in skinless chicken breasts. We are a big fan of those as the chicken stays so tender, but otherwise everything was followed exactly! Delicious-thanks!

Made this for 8 guys and they all loved it.  Used drumsticks instead of boneless breasts and left the skin on, which was a nice tasty touch.  You will have to cook it longer though, but all in all, a huge success!

Made this per recipe,only change was to increase amounts proportionally because we made enough for 10 people.  Super easy to mix up and marinate in zip-lok bag( did this in the morning to grill at 3pm)  Got a lot of compliments and will definately make this again.

I marinated 12 chicken breasts last night and grilled for lunch today.  Chicken had lots of flavor and was very moist.  My mother-in-law who is visiting  from Key West really liked the flavor.  Thank you Tina.

This marinade is AMAZING!!!   I followed it exactly - except only used 2 chicken breasts, so would probably double this for 4 breasts.  This will become a regular marinade for us now. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this twice, just to give it a second chance. The second time I doubled everything in the marinade except the soy sauce. It still tasted like soy, no hint of lime. I think I'll try this again and omit the soy or double everything and reduce the soy to 1Tbs. If you want a strong soy flavor to complete your meal, then this is a good choice.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The only thing I didn't follow was substituted lemon juice for lime because that's all I had.  I marinated for 3 1/2 hours and although the chicken was very juicy and moist after grilling, it was flavorless.  This was barely enough marinade to cover 2 large boneless chicken breasts, so you might want to double it if you are making 4.  I would suggest marinading at least 8 hours if you want to taste any of the marinade, if you just have to try this recipe.

This is awesome!!  I marinated all day and turned the chicken periodically throughout the day.  I doubled the recipe and used a tablespoon more of lime juice.  I was out of fresh garlic so I used powdered garlic.  I also zested the lime and added the zest to the marinade.  My husband loved it and my picky three ear old even ate it and asked for more.  I bet this would be great on grilled shrimp!!  Think I will try that next.

4 stars as is: quick, easy and wonderfully flavorful. 5 stars with the frequently recommended modification of reducing the soy sauce by 50%.

tasted oily and had very little flavor. While the company seemed to like this I certainly did not and would not make this again. The only thing different I did was add ginger to give it more of a kick, and that still didnt help matters. Unfortunately disappointing...

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made as directed, and found it to me a bit too much of the soya sauce taste (could possibly be the brand of soya sauce I use).  I will definately make it again, but will probably reduce the soya sauce to 2 tablespoons and up the honey to 1 1/2 tablespoons.
Thanks so much for sharing

I thought these had good flavor but too mild.  I marinaded it for about 1 1/2 hrs.  Did everything exact.  The flavor that was there was really good but not strong enough.  Maybe marinading about 8 hrs would do the trick!

This came out great!  The sauce didn't penetrate through the meat but that's how chicken is.  This came out really juicy and the reduced sauce was awesome with Japanese short grain white rice.  Served it with Snow Peas Oriental (made with spicy sesame oil) and it was a great meal.  Adding this to the recipe book!  This would be great to have in ziplock bags in the freezer.  As the chicken thaws, the marinade will penetrate the chicken.

I really, really liked this. I doubled the marinade as suggested but kept the soy sauce the same. Great the next day on top of a salad!

It was pretty good i made a few changes: Doubled the Honey, used the juice from a whole lime. Also i only added a dash or 2 of soy sauce because i decided to use Ponzu sauce instead ( which is basically soy with a hint of lemon flavor). I left it marinate for about 24 hours. Served with Veggies and brown rice. Also used left overs the next day to make a chicken quesadilla

There is nothing Key West about this.  It should be called soy sauce chicken because that's all I could taste.  I would follow the recommendations of the other reviewers with upping the lime juice and honey and decreasing the soy sauce.  Maybe even omit the soy sauce.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting.  I let it marinade for just over an hour.  The only change I made was to double the lime juice - and from what I could tell it still needed more.

Nice tangy flavor, a breeze on the grill.  A nice alternative to the standard summer bbq chicken.

My husband and I thought that this was bland.  The marinade smelled good but once it came off the grill there was not much flavor.  In stead of marinade I would suggest infusing it.

I used this as a marinade for chicken chunks, which I put on skewers with apple chunks.  Hubby grilled for me and it was wonderful!  My family don't usually like citrusy things, but loved the subtle flavor of this.

First my apologies to the one who submitted this recipe because we did not like it at all.  It had very little flavor.  However, it was tender.  Any citrus marinade will do the job though.  Your suggestion for marinating for 30 minutes is correct.  Any more than that the citrus starts cooking the poultry.  Beef is a different story.  Easy, yes..Flavor, no.  Sorry

I am going to try this tomorrow night. But I think I will cook it differently. I'll bake it in the oven and baste it with the sauce every 15 minutes or so, just like I do with my honey mustard chicken.

This recipe sounded so good and when I saw the 4.5 star rating on it, I knew I had to try it. Unfortunately, it was a HUGE disappointment! I couldn't believe that the 4 strong and delicious  flavours in the marinade blended together to make one bland mixture. I will never make this again.

My grill was out of gas and I don't know if that made the difference. I sauteed the chicken then added the sauce and let it simmer. It was certainly moist but the taste reminded me of the sweet, sticky and spicy chicken on this site with the sweet, sticky, spicy chicken being much better.

This chicken was pretty good.  I didn't have to marinate very long to get a good flavor and the chicken stayed very moist.  I mostly followed the recipe, but added a little extra honey and it tasted a lot like a simple teriaki sauce.  I think next time, I'll put about half the soy sauce and more honey and lime juice.

Great recipe. The flavor was wonderful and even more impressive was how tender and moist the chicken was.  I only marinated about 2 hours and it was fabulous.  Keeper.

Although this sounded really good because of the ingredients, it was a little "flat" for me. It seems to be missing something - and I even added ground ginger and onion powder. I think it needed some spicy such as chili paste.

I was very pleasantly surprised with the way this turned out.  At first the smell of the soy sauce really put me off, but the chicken turned out to be very moist, not at all sour and cooked to perfection in the time suggested.

Amazing taste! I used the advice from other reviewers and cut back on the soy sauce since it can overpower a dish very easily. I used 3 tablespoons of soy, 3 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of oil,and the juice of one lime. I marinated this in the refrigerator for 8 hours. The chicken was delicious and the grill flavor was perfect for this marinade. I will definately be making the recipe again!

this was a good marinade, although i didnt really detect the "key lime" flavor.  i did marinade it for approx. 6 hrs.  next time i think i'll double the key lime and see what happens.  also, the thicker the chicken breast, the less the marinade stands out so next time i'd pound the breasts down to thinner pieces before adding to the marinade.

The taste was really good and complex. We marinated for about over 24 hours.  However, it was a little thin. I think this would be a perfect recipe for kebabs or maybe very thin chicken breasts.

Amazing!!! Made my really cheap chicken legs so tasty! I love how easy it is, very simple. I substituted lemon juice for lime juice, since that's what I had on hand. My husband is pretty picky, and has to have very flavorful food.  He loved it!

I loved this!!  I used a little extra lime juice becaue I didn't want to waste it.  The honey I used was a tanagrine honey, and I think it added a nice flavor.  This will be one of my regulars.  Thank you!

This was yummy!  I made it last night and it was a big hit with everyone.  I butterflied the chicken breasts as they were very large.  Followed the directions and it came out absolutly delicious!  (Next time I'll double the marinade, put some aside and serve it with the chicken after heating it up a bit.)

i liked this recipe a lot. I was disappointed by how little of the lime you were able to taste after grilling. I think i will add more to the marinade and then some to the chicken while it is grilling. excellent as a main dish or for salad... Yum!

this is a fantastic simple marinade!  i did double the honey and lime juice, but i would add a touch more lime juice next time.  i also added a few shakes of lemon pepper.  these flavors blend so well together.

Amazingly good. I don't have a grill, or lime juice... so I used lemon juice and my broiler. Wasn't crispy like it'd be on the grill, but the flavor was out of this world. Thank you so so much!

Tried the recipe as written and thought it wonderful! Moist, juicy, with just the right tang to make it rather refreshing. Great recipe. Served it with lemony pasta on the side which accented the flavor well, will try it with one of those basil/tomato/mozzarella salads next time.

Followed the suggestions made by "Melissa and Adam" and the chicken came out wonderful. (sort reviews by most helpful). Only other suggestion...marinade the meat in a ziploc bag.  This will give you much more bang from your marinade. Thanks!

I wanted to make something that would be good served cold, so I stole the marinade idea, tweaked it, and used it to marinate and bake tilapia. (It'd be great with any fish I'm sure). This was amazing! I doubled the recipe, used coconut oil instead of the veg oil, and the juice of about 3 limes, and a bit less soy sauce than called for, and fresh garlic with a bit of black pepper.  The coconut/lime combo was amazing, and everyone loved it.  Don't skip the honey! Serve it in more of the sauce and it's incredible.

This is THE best way to grill chicken. I doubled the marinade, and let it chill in the refrigerator for a two days (was supposed to be one, but other dinner plans came up). This made the meat sooo tender and the flavors really melded together.

Very good taste. Definitely let it marinade overnight, it soaked right into the chicken. I will make again but will double and save some to dip the chicken in when eating.

I thought this recipe was awesome, following several suggestions. For3 breasts (most packs I found in my local grocer came in three), I used 2 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 2 fresh limes, squeezed dry, 2 teaspoons chopped garlic and I added a "pinch" of cayenne pepper and 1 teaspoon of meat tenderizer to the marinade. It was perfect. I wouldn't have used any less or any more of any of the spices. 
  I added diced red potatoes, tossed in light olive oil, 1 teaspoon of garlic, and a little salt and pepper baked at 425 degrees for 25 min., and steamed asparagus as sides. It was incredible. Even my fiance, who isn't a big fan of healthy eating, loved this!

Very easy to make, and quite good.  Next time, we will reserve the marinade to pour over the grilled chicken as the  dish could have used a little more sauce.  All in all, a keeper.

This had a milder flavor but was excellent.  You couldn't really taste the lime, so I think the next time I would atleast double the lime.  This had a slightly sweet flavor.  We will definitely make this again!

In a word, BORING!  This was so flavourless.  It was like there was no marinade at all.  I tasted it prior to putting it on the chicken and noticed it was a bit bland but had thought it would improve over time.  No such luck.  I will not make this again.

Pretty good, but nothing really special or different. I used 1/2 TBS sesame oil instead of the TBS of veg. oil. I doubled the marinade and reserved some for basting while the chicken was grilling. Both of these changes probably gave it more flavor than it would normally have. I think a much longer marinating time would bring this from pretty good to very good.

This was so quick and easy.  I just had one chicken breast that I wanted to prepare quickly.  This was perfect.  I shortened all of the ingredients accordlingly,  mixed them in a small non-stick skillet, cut the breast into strips, and cooked on the stove for a few minutes (no time to marinade).  Lots of flavor!  The only reason I hold back one star is because, while it was good and did have lots of flavor, it wasn't spectacular.  No wow!

I really liked the flavour of this chicken and I too doubled the recipe but didn't double the soya.  What would've made it 5 stars was to have a nice sauce to top it with.  Next time I'll follow another reviewers suggestion and add some cornstarch to the marinade and use it as a dressing.

I scaled this down to one serving.  I didn't have any soy sauce on hand so I used Worcheshire sauce (one of the main ingredients is soy sauce).  I cooked it on my George Foreman Grill - this is a keeper!

Just OK.  I made as directed except for substituting fresh garlic for minced garlic and used fresh lime juice.  Nothing spectacular about this, we ended up dipping it in salad dressing during dinner.

Fantastic - I used a little less Soy Sauce though, as I'm not a huge fan of it and didn't want to get too much flavor from that.

We've made this recipe several times with great success.  Lately I've taken to pounding out the chicken breasts to flatten them out just a bit and render them a little more tender.  It works.  The flavors in this recipe go with so many other things like citrus salads, couscous, rice.  Sometimes for a little extra kick we double the lime juice, it's great. Our whole family loves this, guests have loved it, it's a hit.

This recipe was just okay to me.  I was really hoping for more b/c I use a similar recipe for a grilled pork tenderloin (with the addition of vinegar)and everyone loves that recipe.  This just tasted like soy sauce to me.  If I make it again I think I would cut down on the soy sauce and increase the amount of lime juice.

This was very tasty, but like the other reviewers I was hoping for more of a lime taste to it. Next time I make it I am going to up the lime juice, decrease the soy sauce and add some lime zest. I did marinate this overnite and it was very moist. I will try this again with the changes.

Very good marinade; works great when broiling, too.  I would add much more lime juice next time though to give it a truer "Key West" flavor.

I put the ingredients in a ziploc bag for a camping trip.  Let marinate in bag for over 24 hours.  Cooked on the grill.  It was a very big hit.  All the children loved it.  It was nicknamed "Laura's chicken" by everyone.  Great recipe, wouldn't change a thing.

The chicken was very moist, however the flavor was bland.  If I make this again I would increase marinate time to see if flavor was more intense.

Very yummy! I used more honey than called for...and it made a nice, sweet glaze. This was very good with a fresh salad and cornbread. I will definately be making this again!

Delicious...moist, flavorful, tender, etc.  There were no leftovers, and lots of raves.  Easy and quick preparation with regular, everyday ingredients.  I'll definitely make this again.  I marinated for about 8 hours, and that worked just fine.

Came out a little dry, possibly due to marinading overnight, but the taste was lovely.  I substituted margarita mix for the lime juice.  Next time, I'll try marinading for just a few hours.

This was wonderful! Simple and great flavor. We marinated overnight. The one thing we did was pound our chicken breasts to cook evenly on the grill.

Delicious!  I included lime zest in the marinade. I also cooked the chicken in the oven at 400F for about 20 minutes covered with foil and another 20-25 uncovered.

Really good marinade.  I doubled but didn’t really need to with just four pieces of chicken.  Think it would be good with thighs too.  Will definitely use again.

This recipe was so easy to make and  tasted good. I like to marinate meats overnight. But this gives flavors from the ingredients. The only difference was I used low sodium soy sauce and cooked it on an outdoor griddle. It came out good!

It's not enough marinade to cover all the pieces. I increased them significantly.  Instead of grilling I put the individual pieces of chicken and thick chunks of potatoes, carrots, onions and peppers in foil packs with the marinade covering it. Bake in oven or on grill. If you do marinade don't reuse it after the chicken has been in it.  Divide the marinade in half before adding the protein.

Grilled over indirect heat with some hickory chips for smoke. Made it as written this time, might try substituting sesame oil for part or all of the oil next time. Served it sliced with jasmine rice and some sautéed baby Bella and cherry tomato with green pepper, shallots and garlic for a garnish. Definitely a keeper!

7-30-2016  ~When Hubs grills chicken he much prefers bone-in chicken breasts over boneless, skinless.  I would have to agree with him.  While boneless chicken breasts are less tricky to get right, and cook more quickly, they don’t hold a candle to the flavor of the bone-in.  Here too, we also used bone-in breasts, which I marinated for several hours.  To use a trite expression, Hubs “grilled them to perfection,” which always helps with chicken!  (So easy to either over or under cook) This chicken was just awesome good, the marinade itself simply perfect just as is.  No tweaking necessary.  Just enough lime, garlic and soy sauce gave the chicken a mellow, enhanced flavor that even Hubs, who hates marinades in general and anything teriyaki-ish in particular, enjoyed.  I served this with Tammy’s Turmeric Rice, also from this site, and fresh sautéed Swiss chard from my garden.

This was just ok for us. Used bonesless skinless chicken thighs and adjusted cooking time. With the name Key West Chicken we were expecting more of a lime/citrus taste - and when I saw the soy sauce in the ingredients it did make me wonder but thought i would try it anyways. Marinated for about 40 minutes then baked in a toaster oven instead of grilling, and i did use Agave nectar instead of honey - but I thought this was more of an Asian taste and not a "Florida" taste which was what we were looking for (we were doing a Florida food themed dinner). Overall it was good so thanks for sharing.

I tripled the marinade and after tasting I decided it needed more lime flavor. Ended up adding the juice of 3 whole limes and boiled the mixture on the stove so I could baste the chicken while it was grilling. It turned out amazing! =)

I felt like it was lacking depth without any S&P. I chose to sear the chicken in a pan for a minute on each side before baking for 20 minutes. It was perfectly cooked but I felt the marinade was bland.

Good, good stuff (marinated overnight) and very easy inside on the Foreman grill.

Hands down the best marinade for chicken ever. Tons of flavor. We make double for leftovers and have it cold on a salad or in a wrap.

I live in an apartment so I couldn't get that lovely smokiness that the grill provides, but the George Foreman left it very tender and very juicy. I squeezed a little lime juice over the top before eating and it was great. In my opinion it could have done without the garlic, but it was still very delicious.

My chicken tasted good, but somehow didn't have much of the flavor I was looking for.  I even let it marinate over night.  I might try again by adding in a bit more lime juice an honey.

I had made this a few times, with a few tweaks.Double up the lime, honey and garlic. Score the chicken with a few slits then marinade the chicken for an hour or so. You may want to make a separate but smaller batch so you can brush the chicken during the grilling process.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I followed Melissa and Adam's suggestion and doubled everything except  the soy sauce and used the juice of two limes.  I marinated the chicken breasts for about 6 hours.  My husband basted the chicken a little with the marinade while grilling.  The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I am not a chicken fan, but I was fighting with the family over the last pieces of chicken!  I made a double batch of marinade because it just did not look like enough for the chicken breast halves I had.  I let it marinade 24 hours.  It was so flavorful and delicious that the family requested I make it regularly.

This was good.  I'm not much of a fan for just chicken in marinade but I was looking for a marinade I could use that I would then use the chicken for a salad.  This was very good. Not overpowering.  I will try again to just eat the chicken alone but as I mentioned, I'm not much of a fan of fairly plain chicken.

This was very good and really easy to make, although I added more lime juice in order to avoid having the soy and garlic dominate as others had mentioned.  I used chicken thighs and marinated them for 2 hours. Very good with a side of cilantro lime rice and a grilled veggie salad. Yum!

OUTSTANDING!!! I've now made this twice - first; as-written ... second time with VERY minor additions to suit my tastes. In place of the garlic I used a tablespoon of Vietnamese Chili-Garlic sauce so it would have a bit of a kick. Came out great ... but the original recipe is wonderful all by itself. TRY IT on chicken or shrimp kabobs!!!

My family totally enjoyed this dish. It is wonderfully simple and quick. The next time I make this I plan to double or tripple the honey. I could taste the honey ever so slightly. My husband and son said they couldn't taste it all but they loved the dish and want me to make it again with more honey next time.

This recipe is great! I didn't change anything, except doubled the lime juice. I did double the whole recipe, only because I was making 6 chicken breasts. I made this along with Cilantro Lime Rice and everyone loved it. Really, really good and super simple recipe!!

This was good but not wow.  Just not the flavor punch.  My family said it was ok.  I marinated it overnight.   This does not taste like the chicken we had in the keys. 
It was however one of the easiest marinades ever and did smell great.

This was quite tasty - I wasn't actually able to grill the chicken, but baked it in the marinade for about 20 mins @ 425 in a glass baking dish covered with foil.  It turned out juicy, moist and tasty!  I will definitely make this one again!

The honey in this recipe predisposes 'burning' of the poultry and a mess on the grill. Moderate cooking temperature and careful watching are critical to the success of this recipe. Mine did not turn out so well, and I won't be trying it again.

I added some lime peel (about the peel of one half of a lime) and two teaspoons of sherry which has ginger in it and one fourth of a teaspoon of that ginger. Family loved it with boneless pork chops. Thanks for the jump off point to start with. Also doubled all the ingredients except the lime zest and the sherry and ginger, which were added to the doubled recipe.

Love it!  I made 2 recipes to marinade 6 breasts.  Next time I will make 3 or 4 recipes of marinade and reserve some to serve with the chicken or to use when cooking rice.

Tried this twice:  once with regular soy sauce, the second time with low sodium soy sauce.  Barbecued both times.  It was definitely better the second time around, but won't be making again.

Great recipe!  I zested my lime in with the marinade which resulted in more lime flavor.  Would be great with pork also.

We doubled the marinade and skewered the chicken on the grill.  Had an Asian taste to it with the soy sauce.  Good flavor.  I would like to try it with a little heat next time.

This chicken is fast, easy, and delicious! Perfect for when you don't have a lot of time or energy! I usually like to bake my chicken in the sauce at 375 degrees for 30-45 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken breast. The leftover sauce goes great over rice!

Very good! Quick and easy. I was concerned at first that it wouldn't be very flavorful. The lime or garlic didn't really come through for me but the sweet (honey) & soy sauce added good flavor.

This wasn't bad but couldn't give it rave reviews. The chicken was very tender, though.  I didn't taste much lime.  It was more of a sweet barbecue taste.

This was an excellent recipe.  Marinating the chicken all day is what makes this dish moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Very nice, especially for such a simple preparation. I halved the soy sauce and doubled all the other marinade ingredients. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours before grilling, then served each breast sliced over a large salad with baby greens, tomato, red onion, avocado, crumbled cotija and lime-cilantro vinaigrette (recipe on this site). So easy for so much flavor.

Was concerned about a reviewer saying it was lacking flavor, so I kicked it up a few notches. Added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and I used grated orange peel and juice of one orange as I had a bag sitting around. Loads of flavor.

Good, healthy, easy chicken marinade.  I used 3 teaspons of canola oil instead of the veg oil to make it a little healthier.

LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS DISH. i made it on my cast iron griddle on the stove. didn't really get the lime flavor through, but what i got was better. the chicken was very moist and cut easily with a fork. because i tenderized the chicken and preheated the griddle, it took 6 minutes to cook. will definitely make it again!! perhaps on a busy day, just slap it on a bun and go. :)

This was great! I made this in my skillet, I cut the boneless skinnless chicken breast into chunks, doubled the sauce and then used a little cornstrach to thicken the marinade to drizzle over rice. Fantastic, my Hubby loved it!

Great recipe! Next time I will add more lime and marinate alot longer. I baked it at 350 for about 45 mins. I added onions, mushrooms and I love spicy food so I also added 1 tsp of cayenne.

This is a favorite of my family!  We stick to the marinade recipe exactly how it is written but sometime use chicken legs and thighs instead of breast.  Marinade overnight or throughout the day and then grill to yumminess!

I was really hoping this chicken would be great. I followed the recipe exactly even adding another half an hour to the marinating time. The one thing I did different was broiling it instead of grilling it, but I do that all the time. It goes from being done to blackened quite easy because of the honey. It was so simple to make, but the marinade just oddly didn't add much flavor to the chicken for some reason.

This recipe is fabulous!!!  We were very disappointed that there was no chicken left after we all ate.  I doubled the amount of marinade, which seemed to cover better, and I also made this recipe with chicken tenderloins, which was also very delicious.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Excellent!  Made as per recipe, but stir-fried with onions and peppers instead of grilling.  Also, delicious with coconut rice topped with cilantro.  A keeper of a meal, even for my kiddoss!

quick, easy and came out great. Lacking chicken in the fridge I did a turkey cutlet in the marinade and grilled that. Even the fussiest eaters in our house loved it.

A very good marinade for salmon.  I marinated it for about 2 days, and the flavor was not too strong, but delicious. But then, I always marinate meats and fish for longer than it says to.  You could taste just a hint of the lime flavor.

I've made this twice now, and neither time was I able to marinate it longer than about 3 hours. The flavors did not penetrate the meat well, and the marinade does not leave much flavor on the surface either. I think I would combat this in the future with the addition of a tablespoon of some rice vinegar and a bit more canola oil to give the marinade both more tenderizing power and more sticking-to-the-meat power. Thanks for the recipe!

What can I say...people go absolutely crazy over this chicken every time I make it.  Skinless boneless thighs work well too.

tasty! Next time I think I would like a little more lime, so maybe I will baste with juice while on the grill. Chicken was moist and well received!

I marinated this overnight and it had a very good flavor. Served over lettuce and topped with rotel and cheese. Squeezed a lime for a little dressing and my husband and I enjoyed a lovely, light summer meal.

Mouth Watering Goodness!!!! Simple and unpretentious, yet so moist and flavorful!  Let the chicken marinade for 4 hrs or more and the flavors are only enriched.  Extra garlic doesn't hurt either.  I can't wait to try it again......a new favorite of this family of 9!  Thank you so much!

This was very good grilled chicken.  I grilled 10 chicken cutlets and quadrupled the amount of marinade.  Marinaded for about 9 hours.  Very nice subtle flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Tina B!

Very good chicken!  I think we bbq'd it a bit too long so we lost some of the flavour.  Would definately try again to get it right!

This was great.  I added some black pepper, and some garlic seasonings.  Also a full tablespoon of lime juice.  I marinated all day and couldn't believe the flavor.  I also used this marinade for some pork chops  and was delicious.  Thanks this one is a keeper

I saw this recipe this morning...and I had all the ingredients so I thought I'd make this for supper tonight.  What an easy and fantastic recipe!  The only thing I did different was to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs and EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  I also didn't want to grill them with a foot and a half of fresh snow...so I just pulled them out of the marinade after 30 minutes and threw them on top of the stove in a fry pan.  Awesome flavor...and it must have been the honey that charred some of the outside of the thighs...you could have sworn they were grilled.  Thanks for giving me a new favorite way to prepare and eat chicken!

I made this last night and it was very good and easy.  I cut my chicken and put it on kebobs and broiled it, (too cold to grill.)   My son liked it a lot and rated it 4 1/2 -5 stars, My husband loved it.  I think it would also be good on beef.  Today the left over chicken will be great on a salad.  I did use more garlic than the recipe called for.

The flavor is fantastic.  I used a tablespoon of lime juice rather than a teaspoon and it came out great.  Since it's the dead of winter in the Pacific northwest, rather than grill I seared the chicken in a pan with the marinade sauce, then finished it off in the oven.  When I served it, I poured a little of the sauce over it.  Absolutely delightful!

It was ok, but kind of bland. I made sure to pour honey on top before eating, and squeezing a little more lime juice on.

I used triple the lime juice, honey and garlic called for, it still had a pretty mild taste.  I grilled it, too, I think that really made the flavors work together.  I also noticed it seemed to taste better cold the next day.

We call this Manti Pageant Chicken because every year it is served at a outdoor play in Manti, Utah. Have been making this marinade for years and it's always a hit. I haven't ever changed the recipe as we think it is perfect just the way it is. Also excellent with turkey cutlets.

My family loves this! The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle the chicken with garlic salt before grilling.

The flavor was so good, not to mention the aroma of the chicken while on the grill!  My friend whom I prepared it for just had to have the recipe. The only change I made was a little more than a tsp of lime juice - I used 1 1/2 tablespoons it was fantastic.

I made this last night and I will say it was the best chicken I ever made.  I added a little extra soy sauce, a little more lime juice and a big helping of honey, I left the teaspoon of garlic.  I marinated it overnight and cooked it on my George Foreman Grill.  I am excited to share my leftovers with some coworkers today.  Ta da!  Thank you Tina B!

I made this last night and it was amazing.  I did marinate the chicken overnight and we grilled it.  I copied exactly as Melissa in her 2005 review did and it was delicious, plus I doubled the recipe to make more sauce. Delicious and we all had second helpings.  I loved the marinade and so did my entire family.  I will definately make this again.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and only used 2 T. soy sauce and upped the honey to 3T, and 3 cloves of garlic.  Glad I tasted the marinade before because it really lacked any flavor of lime. Actually tasted like teriyaki, which I hate.  So added a whole lime for the juice.  Nice flavor over all, but for marinating more than 24 hrs I thought the taste would have been more pronounced.

I was very excited to try this recipe after reading all of the rave reviews, however even after marinating for 2 hours, this chicken had next to no flavor.

Very nice recipe.  I took the advise of some of my fellow cooks and doubled the marinade recipe (everything except for the soy sauce, I left that at 3 tbsp).  I let the chicken tenderloins marinate for around 5 hours before grilling them.  The chicken turned out great!  However, next time I may take the soy sauce down to 2 tbsp and add an additional tbsp of honey.

I'll give this 5 stars because I think it's me and not the recipe.  I have  hard time getting overly excited over any chicken recipe.  Chicken always seems kind of bland to me.  Definately marinate this overnight to get the full flavor.  I don't know how anybody could marinate chicken for 30 minutes and get any additional flavor at all.  Nice blend of ingrediants and I had everything on hand.  Thank you.

We had this for dinner tonight. It could not have been any more moist.  I did add a little more honey as well as lime juice. Also added a few red pepper flakes for a little heat. The marinating time by recipe was fine, but next time I will do it a bit longer when I have more time to plan.  But it was definitely a HIT in our house.  Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe is AWESOME!! Both my husband and I loved it and are looking forward to left overs tomorrow. My official measurments were 5 tablespoons of soy sauce and honey, 3 tablespoons lime juice, 2 tablespoons veggie oil, and I stuck with the tsp of garlic. Made with yellow rice and sweet potato= SO GOOD!!!!

Pretty good basic recipe.  If you want sweeter, just drizzle a little honey on the top of the grilled chicken after removing from grill.

Made exactly as written, marinading all day while I was at work.  The chicken was flavorful and moist.  Hubby and two picky kids ate with many compliments to be heard.  Thank you for sharing; I will be making this often.

Awesome recipe, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, marinated for 6 hours and the flavor and tenderness was great!  I'm thinking of using it for a pork tenderloin I have in the fridge maybe using pineapple juice to boost the sweetness!

Ah-MAZING!!! Wow, my husband and I both looked at each other when we were done and agreed that we wanted more!  I followed the suggestion of doubling everything but the sooy sauce and I used lemon juice because I didn't have lime.  It sat in the marinade for about 1 1/2-2 hours.  I can't wait to make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Absolutely perfect marinade!  I did make 1.5 times the marinade for three very large chicken breasts, because it didn't seem like it was going to be enough.  The blend of flavors was delicious and it kept the chicken so moist.  This is going to be made quite often this summer on the grill...thanks for the recipe!

I used boneless chicken thighs and they worked beautifully. I marinated them for about five hours. I doubled the honey and added a little more lime as well. I also added chili flakes for a little heat. I will definitely use again.

The flavor of this was okay, but could have used more lime.  The marinade gave the chicken a weird texture, though, that we didn't really care for.  The meat was nice and moist, which was a plus, because BLSL chicken breasts can be so dry, especially when grilling them.  I'll make this again sometime, but I think I'll use more lime and maybe sub brown sugar instead of the honey, because I think that's where the funny texture came from.

I learned you can't buy limes where I live, so I substituted with lemon juice and it was still fantastic as-is...and the recipe was true, I only had to marinate it for 30 minutes, though I had cut mine into strips before marinating because it worked better with my grill.

This was ok. I followed the recipe exactly but instead of grilling, I cooked it in a skillet. Maybe the grilling makes the difference? It just tasted like chicken doused in soy sauce. I couldn't taste many other flavors. Sorry!

Turned out great!! I followed the other reviews and upped the honey and lime, cut the soy sauce and let it marinate for about 6 hours, it was full of flavor and went really well with rice and the Broccoli With Garlic Butter recipe from this site. We'll be using this recipe quite a bit this summer!

This was absolutely amazing. I did have to change the amount of the different ingredients to dull out the soy sauce a bit but that was more for my boyfriends taste than due to recipe error. Other than that this is one of the best things I have ever made and is now my boyfriends favorite meal I make!

This came out good, but I definitely didn't marinate it long enough (a few hours). The flavor wasn't really strong enough and I used the juice of a whole lime.  If you can't marinate overnight, it's not really worth making.  I also suggest squeezing fresh lime over the chicken right before eating.

This was great and received thumbs up ratings from my husband and 3 year old. We baked in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes and then broiled for 10 minutes because I was too lazy to grill. Even in the oven, this recipe was great.

This was just okay for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't have as strong of a lime and honey flavor as I had hoped.  I wish the flavors had been bolder.

Like others, I made extra sauce and baked it. I'm not a big white chicken eater, but this marinade is good. I would cut down on the soy sauce next time and really kick up the lime - the flavor didn't come through.

This is the best grilled chicken recipe EVER!  I make it all the time on my foreman grill.  Pesto noodles or pesto rice accent this dish to the max!  My hubby says this meal tastes better than at a restaurant.  And I agree!

I used the juice from a whole lime and substituted garlic powder for garlic (more concentrated flavor). I cooked this on my countertop grill. This was really delicious. I think next time I will marinate the chicken for more than 1/2 hour to get even more flavor.   I made a cous cous side dish with this.  I put 1-1/2 cups chicken broth, the grated rind of the lime (that I juiced for the chicken), 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a pat of butter in a pot and brought it to a boil. I added 1 cup cous cous, turned off the heat, covered the pot and let it sit 5 minutes. Really tasty and a great compliment to the chicken.

The marinade is a super way to do pork loin as well.  I sliced a 2-lb. loin into medallons and soaked them all night in the marinade, turning them once, halfway through the soak.  Then I grilled them for about 15 minutes, turning once.  We loved them!  After all, pork rally *is* "the other white meat."

After reading reviews regarding the lack of lime flavor I opted to zest a lime as well as increase the lime juice, soy, honey and garlic. Fantastic!  Thanks for sharing.

I upped the amount of lime juice, but still didn't think it was as noticeable as I would have liked.  I think the key is maybe to decrease the amount of soy sauce?  I'm going to try that next time and increase the amount of honey, also.  I love all of the flavors in this marinade, so I hope to be able to perfect it according to my taste.

I thought this was good but I think the next time I make it I'm going to tweak the recipe a but. I did as others had suggested and increased the lime and honey but I still felt the lime was a little understated so I may try increasing it again next time. I also think I may try baking/broiling it so I can save the sauce to plate with the chicken to enhance the flavor. The people I served it to thought it was very good but I felt it could have used a little more oomph!

This was a great marinade that I will use again and again.  I followed some suggestions, using a little more lime juice, less soy, and a tad more honey.  I didn't measure the proportions, so I can't recreate 'my' recipe, but I think there is plenty of room to play around with this recipe.  This was very moist and flavorful.

I did not think this was that great. The soy was overpowering. We sqeezed some extra lime juice over the cooked chicken, which helped some, but it still was not anything special.

Was really not crazy about this recipe.  The soy sauce over powered everything else and you could not taste even a hint of honey or lime.  Will not make this again.

Maybe it's because I didn't grill the chicken but I thought this had very little flavor.

Recipe sounded so good I couldn't wait, so I had to try it using lemon juice since I didn't have lime.  Boy am I glad I did! I marinated it about 5 hrs and added a dozen large shrimp the final hour. My son devoured both breasts and ate all the shrimp, then gave it 2 thumbs up!  Thanks Tina for sharing!

I marinated it for about 4 hours, and it was very moist.  Everyone in the family liked it, which makes it a winner around here!  I did as other suggested and doubled the honey and used a whole lime (and the zest).  We'll make this often!!

I'm giving this four stars because after marinating over night I thought it would have more flavor. It was good but now "Wow". However, the BF said it was one of the best chicken recipes he has ever had.

These were very good. I doubled the recipe and marinated the chicken overnight. I didn't get enough of the lime flavor, it was a small lime. I think next time I will used the Lime Juice that comes in the plastic lime container.

This was great on the grill! I used olive oil instead and marinated for about an hour. I also brushed the extra sauce onto the chicken while on the grill. The chicken stayed juicy and flavorful. I will be making this again!

This recipe was quick and easy. I added more lime, garlic and traded the vegtable oil for EVOO. The flavors mesh together so well and turned out excellent. This will definately be a keeper in our house

I thought this was good, I barbecued it myself.  Hubby and daughter really like the taste of it and ate more than I did, which is a big deal for them since they are not wild about chicken.

Delicious and so easy!  I used boneless chicken thighs and grilled on a gas grill.  I made extra marinade for a dipping sauce.  I will be making this over and over.  So tasty!

The chicken was certainly very moist.  I marinated for 6 hours and used my stove top grill.  A bit salty and I did use low sodium soy.  I probably won't make again - was nothing particularly special for me.

* Deelicious *

I changed the lime juice to lemon juice and added a little more honey. I let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours, and OMG it tasted like in was in there for days. Great quick marinade that won't take all day to pack lots of flavor. Thanks

I doubled the marinade and did 4x's the lime.  Marinated for several hours and it was yummy.  Nice and moist.  Served with a wedge of lime for those who wanted more on their chicken.  I will make again.

Very simple and delicious.  Tasted a bit like a teriyaki to me.  I don't have a grill so I cooked the chicken on the stovetop with a little olive oil and a couple spoonfuls of the marinade.  The marinade cooked down a bit with the chicken juices and made a nice sauce.  Great way to jump start your chicken without having to think too far ahead!

Missing the WOW factor. the chicken came  out nice and tender and juicy but I expected more flavor in the marinade. My family said the same. But with some adjustment I think this could be more flavorable.

This was perfect. I did let it marinade all day but next time it really needs to sit over night to get the full effect of the flavors. I did double the marinade but decreased the soy sauce, which with the extra honey and soy made the best flavor combo. I paired this with the Garlic Parmesan Orzo from this site. This will definitely be one of my top grilling marinades this summer!

This was the best chicken I've ever cooked.  I marinated it for about 5 hours before grilling. It was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and had a wonderful flavor. I served it with Grilled Sweet Potatoes, also from this site.

Everyone loved this!  I reduced the amount of soy sauce, and added more honey.  I also added the zest of 2 limes, and used minced garlic out of a jar and let it marinate overnight.  Definately a keeper!

This was really good. I think I would have even liked it better if I would have marinaded the chicken over night, but I did use the small chicken tenders which really soaked in the flavor in the small amount of time I did marinate them. Definately a keeper.  Worth a try!

I doubled the marinade to give the chicken more flavor.  My husband said that is was also a little too salty, but it was still good.  I would definatly make it again with a little bit of alterations to calm down the salt taste.

I added an extra half teaspoon of lime juice to the marinade and marinated two whole chicken legs in it for 5 hours.I found that the flavour of the soy sauce overpowered the dish and the taste of lime was very mild. Next time I would probably double the amount of lime juice and decrease the soy sauce to about 2 tablespoons or less.

I give this recipe 5 stars not only because of its tastiness (very moist and flavorful) but also because of its ease in preparing (quick marinating time so this can be made last minute) and also because of the availability of ingredients (most are usually on hand).

this marinade had a delicious sweet taste. instead of grilling outdoors due to rainy weather, i cooked it on the george foreman grill. the chicken came out very tender and juicy.  next time i will marinate the meat longer then 30min so it will have a little more taste. all together it was a great recipe.  i will be serving it again, thanks for posting it.

I cut down soy sauce by a third after reading some reviews, and had time to marinate for about 6 hours.  I'll definitely marinate for longer next for more flavor, but its a keeper.

This was good! I used it on Pork Chops and then grilled them...which wasn't bad. However, chicken would probably be better as directed. I would add a little fresh ginger next time! Thanks!

this wasn't bad....I make something similar but without the lime juice/honey.  if I made it again, I'd add WAY more lime juice/honey to really make a difference.  Try it...

I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours and really didn't feel the flavor came through when I grilled it.  Didn't really taste much more than the soy sauce.  I also forgot to 'dab' the excess marinade off so the first side came out really dark and carmelized.  Probably wouldn't make it again.

My family loved this marinade.  I doubled the amount just to make sure my chicken was all covered.  Grilling gave the chicken a nice caramel color and the chicken was moist and juicy.  I marinated for about 4 hours.  Will definitely make again!

Kind of bland when I marinaded over 30 minutes. Would definitely need an over night or several hours to get a better flavor. Probably won't make it again. There are plenty of other marinades that will do the trick quickly. I don't usually plan that far ahead.

This was OK - nothing special.  I used drumsticks because that is what I had.  We could only taste the lime if you got some with lime zest (which I added). Maybe it needed to marinate longer (I marinated for the recommended time).

This is fantastic-not too sweet, not too tart.  I suggest using low sodium soy sauce if marinating for more than 30-45 minutes.

This was a pretty tasty chicken dish. I was a little unsure about the ingredients but the flavors compliment each other nicely. Next time though, I will marinate this longer for more flavor and add more lime juice.

I marinated my chicken breasts overnight and they did turn out moist & flavorful.  The taste was good, but the prevalent flavor was the soy sauce.  I would make again and cut back on the soy & increase the lime juice & honey a bit.

Good taste, very easy. Reminds me of a few other recipes with soy sauce/garlic/something else sauces. I calculated the net carbs to be 5.1 per serving, using the Atkins carb counter. Not bad!

One word- SALTY!!!!!!! Didn't have a bad flavor, just wasn't great either. Marinade smelled great, but I was very disappointed. Would definitely use low sodium soy if I made again.

I'm not sure what the hoopla is about this recipe. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. It was bland. I'm not even sure how to give it more flavor because the taste of the soy sauce dominates everything else.

I always hesitate to barbeque chicken because it usually is overdone and tough.  This is an excellent recipe.  I was having company during the latest "big black out, summer of 2003".  Cooking was a problem.  Fortunately I had the ingredients for the recipe on hand.  I had bought some fresh boneless chicken breasts and used the recipe exactly as written...just doubled it.  My company raved about it.  This is a keeper.

I mixed this as the recipe says except I used a roaster instead of chicken breasts.  I lifted the skin all over the bird, poured about 1/2 of the marinade under the skin. Let set in bag to marinate. Cooked on 450 for 20 min. then 350 for 1 1/2 hrs. Black but delicious and juicy!

This chicken was awesome!! My husband's not a huge chicken fan and I usually think that chicken breasts are too dry, but we both loved these. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I used the same marinade for zucchini and mushrooms and grilled them also. They were okay, but I think it would have been better with some rice. Will try that next time - and there will be a next time!

Followed recipe as given; husband & I both found it good, but not remarkable.  If I make it again, I will bake it rather than grill (as a previous reviewer did.)

I found this to be a little on the salty side.  Other than that, nothing too special.   I probably won't make again.

With so many great ratings this sadly disappointed.  After mixing everything and doing a taste test it lacked pizzaz.  I reviewed the recipe to confirm the measurements and ingredients.  Not finding any mistakes, I added it to my zip bag with the chicken and marinated overnight assuming it would meld and we’d enjoy it.  Nope.  Several other reviews suggested adding more lime juice and honey.   Neither my husband nor I could decide what else is missing, so I’m just not keeping this one.  Sorry.

This was just ok to us. We all sampled one piece between us and nobody dug in for a piece alone. Even with adding splashes of lime juice while it was cooking it only had a hint of it. Maybe if it marinates longer it’s better I’m not sure. Right now I’m getting rdy to look for a recipe to try and salvage it with as nobody will eat it. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is great! The chicken turned out tender and juicy and my husband and son loved it. I would’ve preferred to have a bit more of the lime flavor come through so next time I will add more. The family has already requested these again so I will be making them again soon!

Having grown up in South Miami I had to give this recipe a try. I must say that it was very good. I had every intention of following the recipe exactly as written, but alas... I had to make a slight adjustment as to how long and in what manner to grill the breasts. The chicken breasts that we had were rather large and we thought that the cook time might need to be increased. We were correct. We cooked the breasts at 8 minutes per side over direct heat but at that point the meat only had an internal temperature of 142° F. We always cook poultry to an internal temp of at least 160° F. The USDA suggests 165°F. Anyway, so at that point we moved the breasts to the indirect side of the grill, placed the cover back on and allowed them to continue to cook for another 8-10 minutes. They came out fantastic! We paired them with black beans and rice, a salad, Cuban bread & butter and a nice red wine (I know... but I prefer red over white). :) This is a “keeper” and I’m sure that it will be made again before the end of the grilling season.

I found this recipeat Publix as one of their apron meals.. I do add a tablespoon of lime juice instead of just the teaspoon and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey.  This is one of the juiciest recipes for chicken breasts that I've ever made.. And i now make it often.. People request it often.  Lol

This is delicious and it is hard to make it better.  I substituted Gazebo Room dressing  ( from central PA) for the vegetable oil. It’s delicious and leftovers are great in a salad.

This was just “okay”. We marinated the chicken longer then the recipe said, over an hour. I have a feeling that adding more lime juice and marinating for a longer time, maybe even overnight would make it tastier. Honestly it just tasted like any juicy, well grilled chicken breast. The flavours of the marinade failed to shine through.

Great flavor for such a simple recipe with so few ingredients. I did double the marinade and placed in a ziploc rather than a glass dish to ensure complete contact with all surfaces of the chicken. I served with black beans and yellow rice and sliced avocados. This meal will be great for mu husband’s lunchbox tomorrow! Definitely making again!

I used chicken thighs and, per others' suggestions, decreased soy sauce and increased honey and lime juice. Next time I might add a little red pepper flakes. Delish.

Bland. Bland. Bland.  I got only the faintest hint of flavor from the  honey and a lot of salty flavor from the soy sauce.  It was just so disappointing.  I followed the recipe exactly and just can't believe the positive reviews that this recipe received. The only positive was that the meat was tender but that's NOT due to the marinade; it's because I know how to grill.  I'm glad it worked for others and I sure wish it would have for me too.

To start off, I will definitely make this again! I did not change any ingredients but I did make it with two protein choices. I used chicken and shrimp, marinated separately. The recipe went very well with a cilantro lime rice dish that I served as a side.

I made this straight from the recipe. When I make it again, I may tweak the amounts of the ingredients. It went well with sliced seasoned potatoes on the grill with fresh pineapple. I don’t cook a lot but my wife said she liked it also kudos

OK, sort of. It was okay, but a little dry. It might have been my fault [probably] However; skinless chicken should never be grilled!!

Doubled the recipe since I cooked a lot of chicken. It tasted like teriyaki which I'm not to fond of.  My husband liked it so was happy about that. Would have liked more of the citrus taste so will use less soy sauce next time and increase the lime. Maybe more garlic,  too.

Very good chicken. I ended up using 2 TBSP of lime juice instead of 1 tsp and multiplied the other ingredients (except chicken) by 1.5 times to increase the amount of marinade. I then coated chicken per instructions and marinated for 24 hrs. I rotated chicken after 12 hours and grilled as instructed. Chicken turned out very flavorful and moist.

I don't usually like boneless skinless chicken because I find it very dry.  Not with this recipe.  Very moist  and everyone loved  it including my picky  12 year old grandson.

My husband and I were disappointed at the weak flavor of the chicken.  We will try it again as it has ingredients that we enjoy using. We will go for the overnight marinating and perhaps make a double batch so we can baste it .

I did this in the instant pot. Marinated as directed then sautéed, then put the chicken back in the marinade dish on the rack with a cup beneath. Pressure for 10 minutes. Delicious and tender!

Like many others have noticed, there just wasn't much flavor to the chicken. It was somewhat moist okay, but lacked in the flavor department.

This recipe is another way to change up your grilled chicken.  Following other reviewer's advice, I doubled all marinade ingredients except soy sauce.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper.  It was a tasty recipe, and came out tender and juicy.  We both agreed it was a recipe to do again.  The next time I will increase the lime juice to maybe 1.5 TBL, decrease the honey a bit, and increase the cayenne pepper.  I boiled the marinade 5-10 minutes, and used it as a dipping sauce for the chicken, as well a "gravy" on our baked potatoes.  I will definitely do that again!

I used Bragg's enzyme for soy sauce and add grated ginger with garlic minced to the marinated mix and marinated about an hour and chicken was delicious.

Tasty
I'm sure it would be even better on the actual grill outside but I live in an apartment and am not allowed to use my grill.
I only changed it up a bit 
I used chicken legs and took the skin off. 
Added more lime and honey and less soy sauce or after reading reviews I felt the soy would overpower the taste. 
I cooked it in a grill pan then in the oven at 350 covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for about 8 minutes on low broil. 
I also did NOT get rid of the marinade.
No reason to with a dish that will be cooked thoroughly.

Made the marinade just as directed, except added a little more lime juice (after reading a few reviews) & used thighs, since that’s what I had.  Wonderful!  Great, complex flavor; a definite 5-star recipe & easy, too!  This one goes to the top of my list!

I totally enjoyed this chicken dish, I tweaked it a little as I don't have a grill, so I marinated the chicken overnight, and baked in the oven on 395 degrees for about 25 minutes....It was delicious, and everyone gave rave reviews on this recipe....chicken was moist,  tender and so flavorful!....KUDOS

This chicken was excellent! Grilling is an easy gateway to cooking, so I recommend it to everyone (including beginners)! My one caveat is that you should know how hot your grill gets, for instance, mine gets scorching hot so I instead cooked it on medium heat and it came out perfect! The marinade is simple and effective, perfect for a weekday meal.

Pretty flavorless. I upped pretty much everything but the soy sauce (3 Tbsp soy, 3 Tbsp honey, 4 Tbsp lime juice, 2 Tbsp veg oil, and 2 tsp garlic) and marinated 45 minutes. It wasn't even well seasoned in terms of saltiness, and I couldn't taste pretty much anything in the marinade. I used chicken tenders as to have more surface area for the marinade to sink in, too. I thought 45 minutes would be fine, as my simple marinade of soy sauce and poultry seasoning does great at 30 minutes. Had to pull out the Yum Yum sauce so the chicken I was eating would have SOME flavor- didn't want to eat it as it was. Maybe it needs to marinate longer, but I probably won't try it again.

This is one of my go-to recipes. I like to use chicken tenderloins and cook on skewers. everyone loves meat on a stick.  I have also put the chicken soaking in the marinade in the freezer - and it's perfect!

I made this for July 4 and it was yummy!  I followed the advice of others and doubled everything but the soy sauce.  I also probably more than doubled the garlic because  for us, you can't have too much garlic!  Marinated for about 8 hours.  Very easy to make and will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. While it was kind of tender and the flavor on the outside of the chicken was good, it really needs to marinate overnight, I believe, to be more flavorful and tender.

I'm not sure why this turned out so horribly for us when everyone else seems to love it. I marinated overnight but there was still almost no flavor. And unfortunately, the little flavor that was there wouldn't have gone well with bbq sauce or other condiments so we just sat in silence, eating our bland chicken. I can't even come up with suggested improvements for this one. It's that bad.

This is my go-to marinade for chicken, especially boneless breasts. I save some for dipping sauce and use the rest to marinate. Taste is balanced without any one ingredient overpowering the other.

I gave 4 stars because, as written, the recipe didn't do what I expected. I added more lime juice until I got the sourness I craved, and after grilling, I could no longer taste the marinade so I'm glad I made extra to drizzle on top.

I used legs and wings, not breasts. It's all I had, and I'm not sorry that I used these pieces. Using this recipe, it could make a fan out of the anti-dark meat club....

That said, the combination of ingredients is incredibly tasty (when tweaked) and it makes the chicken cook up VERY nicely on the grill. Of course, if you are awful at grilling, it won't save you, but it loosens up the chicken meat and makes the skin crisp up and taste great. Like I said, the flavors were muted after grilling, so I drizzled the extra marinade (NOT the stuff I soaked the chicken in; use EXTRA, UNTAINTED MARINADE) on top of the grilled chicken.

Will definitely make again.

Very good. I also made this on the stove with a frying pan with a bit of oil drizzled on the pan (medium / med high for ~7 minutes per side) Recommend adding a bit more of everything, and as other comments say, more lime juice, I used the juice from one full lime and think it could have used more ( I let it sit for 4 hours in the fridge before cooking)

My favorite chicken dish! I follow Melissa and Adam's proportions and it's perfect. I add a dash of red chili flakes to marinade, start bone-in pieces in the oven and finish on the barbecue. I'm hungry just thinking about it! ??????

Very good but  next time I would add more lime juice and let marinade longer. Also the tenderloins were a lot better, so I'll cut the breasts in strips instead next time .

Fantastic.My changes: Tamari instead of soy sauce, extra garlic and lime, used half vegetable oil and half sesame oil, added a splash of chili oil.

Too bland!! I tried to add more flavor with lime ponzu sauce, which added more lime, soy and sweet flavors. I also added extra garlic. Even with the flavor boosts and overnight marination, this chicken had barely any taste, and it wasn't even infused through the meat; the flavor was only on the outside! Famished hubby only ate 1/4 breast, even though he hadn't eaten all day! He requested that I never make this again!

Always make it just like the recipe calls for-only double. I turn the chicken into fajitas and it’s the best marinade for it.  I cut up some peppers and onions throw it all in a pan and -nice, quick and easy!     Perfect every time.

Sorry, but although this was easy and quick to prepare, it was fairly bland. I did marinade it for the 30 minutes as described, but in the end I dipped each bite in some BBQ sauce so that there would be some flavor with the tender chicken.

I made this as written. I could not taste any lime flavor, after all of the work zesting and squeezing the lime!  However, the chicken was really tender and I may make it again using different seasoning.

This recipe is great!  I butterflied the chicken breasts because we like it that way and marinated them for 90 minutes (that's how much time I had).  Also, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil - another preference.  I think this marinade would be good on both dark and white meat and other things like swordfish.  Will definitely make this again!

I followed some suggestions, the first time, and it was good enough to repeat & investigate further. I followed the recipe, this time, except that I used a Tablespoon of lime juice and 2 teaspoons of garlic. It WORKED!!! I'll probably use EVEN MORE lime juice next time but I WILL take care not to marinate too long, as citrus can start making the chicken mushy.

Very good, easy marinade. I doubled the recipe but did add some lime zest as well and green onions mainly for looks. My only wish is I would have done the juice of 2 whole limes instead of one. I also used chicken thighs (for me) and breasts for my wife. Good recipe, but be sure to double it and add more lime like all the reviews say. A little ginger might be a good add as well.

I doubled the recipe for 6 large breasts. Made changes and did the following:
3 Tbsp soy sauce, 3 Tbsp honey, 2 Tbsp oil, juice of 2 limes, several garlic cloves minced. Mixed the ingredients well and marinated chicken with it for about 3 hrs. Grilled the chicken. It turned out super moist and you could really taste the lime

Very nice for a quick chick. Had to do indoors, so marked on the raised skillet, and finished in the oven. Was about 15 mins in the oven at 350. Added a bit more garlic, but other than that, same recipe.  Worked well with Cajun wild rice and asparagus. Kids loved it. Thanks for a great meal!

I read some of the prior reviews and changed just a few things: coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, added mustard, and added a lot more lemon and a lot more garlic. Baked covered at 350 for 30 min and then broiled 5 min on each side, really great! Very juicy and seared :-) just perfect!

It smelled wonderful while cooking. However, there was absolutely zero flavor from the marinade. I had to cut and season the chicken before serving.

My wife and I enjoyed this key west chicken very much.  One of the best new dishes We've had in a while.  We did make a few subtle changes based on reviewers (extra lime) and let it marinate overnight before grilling (with pecan wood).  It was outstanding.  We tried it again the next week cooking it in a skillet inside but it was not quite as tasty as the barbecued version.. then again what is better NOT barbecued?

I've made this twice now. First time,  I followed the instructions exactly.   Very good.   The next time I made it, I made a few changes and I think it turned out better.  Changes I made:

Juice of 1 lime
Used sesame oil instead 
Added 1/4 c of chicken broth 

I marinated the chicken (cut into strips)for two hours.  Skewered and baked in the oven.  Whipped up a peanut sauce to serve with the chicken.

It only lost a star because it was just a bit too bland. Next time I would marinade it longer and do plan on making it again. I follwed the advice of others by adding more lime .It really was juicy and tender. One of my more favored chicken recipes.

This is probably the simplest yet flavorful and delicious marinade you will make. I get generous with the garlic and feel free to throw in the limes into the marinade just to kick up that "lime" kick.

The predominant flavor was soy sauce.  I didn't taste any lime.  Won't make again.

I made this last night - only used 2T soy sauce, and squeezed in some extra lime and honey to make up the difference in volume. I don't think 30 minutes is a long enough marinade time, as I hardly tasted anything special on the chicken. But, the marinade by itself seemed good, so will try again.

This was fabulous!  The chicken was so tender.  I didn't have any soy sauce so I used teriyaki  sauce and doubled the lime juice i also toasted sesame seeds and added some sliced limes to the marinade. Very yummy!

My very picky 11 year old son loved this dish. I also used the marinade to prepare grilled shrimp, and that was even better than the chicken.

Excellent marinade.  We grilled it outside last night.  I used the ingredients as directed, but marinated them in a zip bag for two or three hours, turning occasionally.  We'll be serving this for guests in a few days.  I haven't decided if I want to grill it the night before and serve it on a green salad, or make kabobs with pineapple, mango, and red pepper, and maybe a little mild onion.  It could be served over some kind of rice.  I'm also thinking of marinating some shrimp in it too, as another reviewer suggested.  So much you can do with this!  Thanks so, so much for sharing!

What an awesome recipe! I cooked the chicken breasts on the stovetop. I cooked the chicken in all of the marinade, so that we could have some sauce. The chicken came out moist and flavourful. Next time, I will up the amount of honey and use a little less soy sauce. This one is definitely a keeper!

Everyone LOVED IT! Flavorful and moist. I made this as the recipe says and it turned out great. Only thing I might do differently next time is to marinade it longer (Mine marinaded for just a few hours.) and maybe even baste some reserved marinade while grilling just for fun. Mmm! This also went great with coconut lime rice.

I was really excited about this recipe....only to be somewhat disappointed.  I found the marinade to be bland and it did not add a lot to the chicken even though it was marinated for apx. 2 hrs.  Will try again....will double the marinade, and marinate the chicken over night.  Will also keep some of the marinade seperate so that the chicken can be basted while cooking.  The marinade was made exactly by the recipe.  Maybe next time, I will increase the lime juice, as well as the garlic.  Might also add a few red pepper flakes.

I thought this was quite good.  Not sensational but good.  I will make it again.  I doubled the marinade recipe,  used chicken tenders, marinated only 1 hour, grilled it on my stove top grill pan.  I don't have an outdoor grill. My husband liked it. Because of the honey, the grill pan was a little sticky and required elbow grease to clean it.  I might try broiling it next time on foil for easy clean up.

I've not had much luck with grilling boneless skinless chicken breasts ... until now!  This was delicious, very moist and flavorful.  I did use more lime juice, about 2 Tbsp.  I used 2 leftover breasts in Chicken and Black Bean Casserole from this site, and then used the leftover casserole in burritos.  All good!

This was bland and DRY, DRY, DRY (even with doubling the marinade). Not sure if hubs cooked it too long on the grill, but this added nothing interesting to our meal. I'll be removing this from my recipe box & moving on to other things.

This was a very good flavored quick and simple chicken marinade?  I only marinated for about 20 minutes because i didn't see the recipe before I decided to prepare dinner.  I'm sure it would have been even more flavorful had I let it marinade for a few hours.  I will be making this again.

This was very good. We'd like a little more lime taste next time. I added 2 tsps but it still needed more. But enjoyed the taste

super delicious! I don't have a grill, so I cooked the chicken on a pan instead. But the flavor was amazing!

I love trying different versions of Grilled Chicken. This one was a combo of sweet and salty which goes very well with my husband as he has the biggest sweet tooth. I actually marinated it overnight so the flavor went right in to the last bite. We loved it.

This was a great marinade, simple, yet very tasty.  I used skin on, bone in chicken breasts and marinated for maybe two hours, then grilled them over low heat.  They were delicious!

I tried this recipe and it was excellent - the chicken was flavourful and juicy.  I will most certainly be making this again.   Thanks Tina B. for sharing this one.

Definite summer cookout keeper.  I marinated skinless, boneless chicken thighs overnight.  I overcooked the first couple of pieces; the flavor is delicate, so overcooking the chicken on the grill may result in losing some of the flavor.  Family loved this chicken, I will be making it again!

It was a very nice recipe. I prepared everything as it indicates, just added some grated gingeroot and marinated the chicken overnight. So wonderful its aroma! I used my oven on broil and it had a perfect finish. My hubby and daughter loved it!

This received a big thumbs up by the entire family. That includes the picky hubby and the oftentimes picky 4 yo. I doubled most of the marinade except the soy sauce based on other reviews and pan grilled it. Other than that followed as is. Will be making this again I think it would also be good with a little cayenne pepper. Honestly I didn't have a chance to taste as I used it to mask the Brussels sprouts I was eating lol had to keep my game face on so the 4 yo didn't see. Next time I won't make other new recipes along with this I'll stick with tried and true sides.

This marinade is FANTASTIC!!!!!! My husband and I are foodies and are pretty particular and we both agreed that we will be using this marinade often.  I only used two chicken breasts and marinated it for 3 1/2 hours turning it several times. Treat yourself and try this.

Delicious. I prepare this dish on the stove-top by pan-frying the chicken. Serve with a salad, rice or pasta and some home-made salsa. I have had so many compliments on this dish. Yum :)

Very tasty and simple marinade using ingredients you have on hand! I used 1tbsp of Lime juice instead of 1tsp. I intended to marinade the chicken overnight, but it ended up I couldn't cook the chicken that night. So it sat in the fridge for another 24 hours. It was fantastic!! Will definitely make and enjoy again. Thanks for the recipe.

Quick, easy, and delicious. although i found that the  chicken didn't take as much flavor as i expected it was great. I made this with white rice and vegetable mix. the key for me was to place the chicken on top of the rice and add hot sauce.

This was pretty good.  I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe but kept the soy at 3 Tbsp.  I only had 1 lime so I did use a few squirts of key lime juice.  Wish it all could have been fresh but I did add 1 tsp of lime zest to play up natural flavor.  I was only preparing two chicken breasts so I used half the marinade and saved the rest for later.  I probably could have used all the marinade for two breasts but was afraid it would overwhelm the meat.  I let it sit all day in a ziplock (turned once) before grilling but next time would try doing the night ahead.  The meat was moist and had a hint of flavor.  Nex time would just want to use more marinade or let sit longer.  But like I stated, I was worried with all the acidity from the lime.

Hubby is not a novice griller, and his specialty is chicken.  This was not good!  Very dry, and it burned by the time he got it to the correct temp.  Will try again with more lime juice, but will elevate it from the grill rack (our grill isn't adjustable so we use foil racks) and will keep some of the marinade for basting.  Served with a prepared box of Goya Carribean rice mix, which is dellicious.

This was a good marinade. Not GREAT but good.  I thought it should have had more flavor given the ingredients.  Found it a bit blah but the chicken was very moist.  I used chicken breast and, due to weather, cooked it on an indoor grill. If I make it again, I will definitely add spices.

Great recipe!  I added the zest of the lime and cracked black pepper to the marinade for extra flavor.

Neither my husband nor I thought it had much flavor.  Even marinated longer than stated.  One good thing because of the honey and soy sauce it sealed the chicken and it was nice and moist.  I cooked on medium low with the lid closed on the grill.

Excellent. Made the chicken super tender. I placed fresh lime slices on the chicken the last 10 mins it was on the grill.

I lacked in the lime and used lemon pepper instead. I also used the George Foreman instead of the grill (as it is -10 here in Denver). I think the flavors would be better on the grill, the Foreman just didn't cut it. I served it with Asian style veggies which helped. I give it 4 starts since the recipe was a semi dud by user error!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I grew up eating "Hawaiian Chicken," a very similar recipe, minus the garlic and lime. I will never eat it without those two little touches of heaven again! The depth of flavor that the lime adds is unreal. I love how quick and simple this is to make, and I generally have all the ingredients on hand. Excellent low fat dinner recipe!

Have made this several times now, and it always gets rave reviews.  I marinate the chicken overnight though, to let all fo the flavors settle in.  Yummy!

I have made this for years but please dont call it Key West, unless KEY LIME JUICE is used. Key Limes have a completely different taste than regular limes.  They are not similar. Try it with Key Limes you will love it.  I know they arent avail. everywhere, so then get bottled Key lime juice. thanks.

This recipe is good, but nothing special. It's great for a pinch when you don't know what to have because it is easy and you are likely to have the ingredients on hand.

Simple, but so juicy & tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly as written & hubby said it's a keeper.  I think time I will try increasing the lime juice, but just a bit...don't want to mess with success!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this exactly as written.  Not much flavor.  I think it needs to marinade for longer than 30 minutes.  I would also use LOW SODIUM soy sauce if I were to try this again, but I probably won't.

This is a great recipe.  The only things I changed were a) to marinate for a couple of hours and b) I increased the lime juice to 1T - a teaspoon didn't seem like enough, and as it was I barely caught any lime flavor.  I will be making this one again for sure, and will try it with Lime Cilantro Rice from this site.  Thanks for sharing, Tina.

It's my fault I didn't have charcoal for the grill.  I thought it was just okay but one of my daughters and boyfriend loved it.  I think cooking on the grill would add a lot more flavor.

A nice simple marinate for chicken.  As suggested by others, I upped the lime.  I also added some extra garlic.  I made the marinade the night before and combined it with the chicken (boneless thighs) before leaving for work in the am.  Grilled them up and they were very moist and tasty.  I made a spicy Asian peanut apple slaw to go with it and found it was a great match for the chicken.  I think this would be a good leftover to use in a salad for lunch, but unfortunately I didn't get to put that to the test because it was all gone.

I let the chicken marinade for about 5 hours. Made as recipe called for with a little more garlic.  It was really tender and delicious

This was very easy and great flavors.  I added pineapple juice to the leftover marinade and used as a sauce and served with grilled pineapple slices.  Boiled then simmered the marinade to thicken it.

Great chicken marinade, only had 20 mins to marinade and still tasted great. Served with steamed rice and asparagus, a super easy, affordable meal! Will try it overnight with pork and pineapple juice next.

We only had 5 hours to marinate the chicken. I doubled all but the soy sauce and added red ground pepper. Excellent and we will repeat this one!!

I enjoyed a new chicken recipe.....great flavor mix.  The next time I make this I would like to marinate the chicken overnight to deepen the flavor.

I love it. Thank you. I  made it exactly as written. Soy sauce, honey and lime are't supposed to be "strong" ingredients. They are meant to compliment the poultry in this case and that it did.

Only thing I added was a little bit of cooking wine to the marinade.  Used a stove-top pan that has grill grooves on the bottom.  Turned out amazing.

The combination of flavors was excellent.  The longer the meat marinates, the better the flavor.  Make extra marinade to use for basting during grilling.

This had a really delicious flavor to it.  I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours to really let the flavors seep in.  Then I just tossed them on the grill.  For such an easy recipe the flavor was great, and the ingredients worked really well together.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours, and even though my husband forgot about it on the grill and it got a little black around the edges, it still had great flavor and will be a recipe that we continue to use.

I was encouraged by all the stars this recipe got, but after making it I was a little disappointed. I thought it was good, but it didn't have the type of flavor I thought it would and my boyfriend said it was  really bland.

This marinade was just ok, all you can taste is the soy sauce. It did keep the chicken tender, used boneless breasts and thighs.

I did enjoy this dish.  Next time I will add either some more garlic and rock salt to step it up.  I will also try with agave instead of honey.  Oh only use high heat to sear, then lower to a medium heat.  But good none the less!

Wow!  I followed the amounts given for the marinade but used 3lbs of fresh, boneless, skinless, chicken tenders.  I doubled the marinade for this amount of chicken and had more than enough.  I let this marinate for about 4 hours.  The chicken came out soft, tender and juicy.  My whole family loved this.

Very juicy - grilled chicken is normally very dry in our house.  This maintained its moisture very well and the lime was not overpowering.

Turned out amazing even though I screwed it up (tried to put frozen chicken on BBQ). Once I finally got it all done, everyone loved it. My 1 1/2 year old gobbled it up.   Looking forward to next time as I'm sure it will be even better!

I doubled the marinade ingredients but added more honey and lime juice as others suggested.  I also added a few drops of tabasco sauce.  The chicken was moist and delicious.

Can't beat this for simple and great taste.  My breasts  only took 4 minutes per side and they were not exactly thin.  It is easy to overcook chicken and when you do it gets dry.  I recommend trying a shorter time and checking with a thermometer if you are unsure.  I took mine off after 8 minutes total and they were barely 160 and quite tender and juicy.

This is delicious.  My husband makes this and does a fabulous job.  He made it for my parents, and my dad loved it- way to please the father-in-law!  Note:  it's okay for it to look burnt- part of the deliciousness!  Also, my husband cooks this on a griddle; he sprays the surface with PAM first.

This wasn't bad.  I used a spoon of white miso paste for one of the spoons of soy.  I also used chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand.  I baked it.  I'm sure it's much better on the grill as most things like this are.  Smoke definitely imparts a flavor hard to replicate.  I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't wowed.

I did 3 breasts cut lengthwise and doubled the honey. After marinating it for an hour threw it on the stovetop and it was delicious. Served it with brown rice.

Loved this recipe!  I doubled the sauce part of the recipe, cubed the chicken and cooked it in a pan instead.  The extra cooked sauce over rice was delicious too!  I will definitely make this again!

This was really delicious and definitely easy to make. Like one of the other reviewers I baked this in the oven at 350 degrees.  I didn't discard the marinade,but poured it over the chicken in the pan after marinading and baked it all together

I marinaded the chicken for about 2-3 hours in a baking dish so the chicken was soaking about 1/2 way down in the marinade.  I then baked it in the same dish at 425 for about 25 minutes.  The flavor was great and the chicken was nice and moist.  Good flavoring, but not overwhelming.  Good and easy recipe worth repeating!

I'm surprised I didn't like this recipe. For me, the soy sauce and garlic was way too overbearing...., and I love soy sauce and garlic. I will try again but next time I will cut the amounts of those 2 ingredients by half.

Amazing! I'm just beginning to cook (I literally only made macaroni and cheese and poptarts before), but I decided to get brave and try this recipe! Not only did I think it was good, but my boyfriend who is an excellent cook (and a tough critic) couldn't stop raving about it! Now I'm just going to have to live up to the awesomeness of this recipe every time I cook!

I was expecting this to have a really nice lime flavor, so I was a little disappointed with the result, because I could not taste any lime flavor at all. Even though I could not detect the lime, the chicken itself had a very pleasant flavor, and it was also very tender. I didn't use only chicken breasts...I tripled the recipe and used an assortment of chicken pieces. This was enjoyed by everyone who tried it, but I'm not sure if I would make it again...thanks anyway!

I was craving a Tequila Lime grilled chicken, I used this recipe as my base and added several spoonsfull of Jose Gold tequila, 3 limes, teriyaki instead of the soy sauce. The garlic smelled so good, the honey was lovely and the margaritas we all enjoyed while the chicken grilled made for a blissful Carolina evening. Of course it would also have been nice to be down in Key West with my toes in the sand! We'll make this again for sure!

This was delicious!  I put it over some chicken thighs and cooked it in the crockpot for a few hours.  I didn't even let it sit for a half hour, just cooked it.  I will be making this again.

Love this.  the only change i make is doubling everything in the marinade except the soy sauce, so the soy is not so overpowering, and it makes a bit more marinade.  Marinading overnight is a must.

Just loved this. Didn't have time to marinate for very long but it still turned out delicious! Next time I'll plan ahead and marinate overnight.  Thanks Tina B!

Thought it was just okay but I only marinated fro 2 hrs and I had very thick boned chicken breasts so the flavor didn't quite sink in.  Next time I will try thinner pieces and marinade longer.  I'm sure it will taste very good!

This marinade was alright, but I couldn't taste the lime, garlic or honey at all, just the soy sauce. Next time I will double the lime and half the soy sauce.  I used garlic powder instead because it stuck to the chicken better but I will try shredding the garlic next time. Thirty minutes was plenty of marinating time for me.

Made this as written, with chicken, the first time. Second time I used chuck steak tenderized with a Jaccard tool which I then marinated overnight in the marinade recipe, which I did modify. I increased the ginger to 1-1/2 tsp of powder, garlic to 2 T & cumin to 2 tsp, giving it a bit more "kick" w/o appreciably increasing the "heat." I also increased the honey by 1 T, to 1/4 cup, because I found the lime juice just a bit too sour and added 1/4 C white wine. I added about 1 pound of peeled raw shrimp to the marinade 2 hours before cooking, then cooked the beef & shellfish on separate skewers. It's a great way to prepare chicken, but I think it a five star as modified & used on beef.

This is definitely the best chicken marinade I have found!!! ALL my kids ate it, even the picky eaters. The best part was, the next day, I sliced up the leftover chicken breasts (I made a lot) and made sandwiches with tom, let, and mayo. The kids were so upset when the chicken was eaten all up and there was no more. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will be using it a lot!!

This recipe is great-I did change the measurements slightly though:  3T soy, 3T honey, juice of 1 lime, and 2 cloves of garlic.  I marinated for 4-5 hours and grilled.  It was delicious, but would be even better marinated overnight.  I served it with rice and grilled asparagus that I marinated in the same recipe.  Wonderful-you should try it!!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was, but I did marinate overnight. My chicken turned out amazing! Moist, flavorful,and juicy. I never knew chicken breasts could be so tender and delicious. I will definitely make this again very soon.

I wasn't impressed. Not very lime-y and really rather bland. With all the good chicken recipes on here, I doubt I would make this again.

This was pretty good. I threw in lime zest, too, and let it marinate for about 2 hours.  Made it with the Cilantro Lime Rice recipe from this site.

I definitely suggest marinading it longer.  I followed the recipe exactly-- marinaded for 30 minutes, and it turned out very bland.  I'd also suggest adding more lime and garlic.

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated the chicken overnight.  It was very good, but I'll probably add a little more soy sauce and garlic next time.  If marinated only 30 minutes, I think it would be very bland.  And if you want any leftover marinade to cook and serve with the chicken, you probably should double the recipe.

I also liked this chicken. Very moist and yummy flavor. I marinated it all day and boiled the marinade so I could brush it over the finished chix, giving it an additional coating of goodness! Thank you Tina for a scrumptious way to make poultry not boring!

OMG, this was delicious!!! I doubled the marinade, and served this over brown rice, topped with guacamole.  For the sides I used onion and pepper roasted in balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It is surely to remain a favorite in our house.  Thanks/1

I was a little underwhelmed by the chicken after reading so many rave reviews.  Maybe it's because I only marinated for about an hour and a half and baked it in the oven being that I don't have a grill here in NYC.  My family liked it however, may try again but will defintely marinate overnight next time!

This was really good!!! I let it marinate overnight and we had it for dinner the next day. It was so easy to just whip it up the night before and throw it on the grill the next day!! It looks like it would have a lot more flavor than it does (especially in my case, after marinating overnight), BUT it's still really GOOD! I will use this marinade for anything that calls for grilled chicken from now on. We can't wait to try out grilled chicken clubs with it, or maybe even fajitas! Thanks!!!

Wow, even my very picky husband said "this can go in the rotation"!!  I marinated 2 blsl breasts and 6 blsl thighs in a double batch of marinade for about 7 hours.  They grilled to perfection with no changes to the recipe.  I'm going to put the leftovers in a chicken fried rice for tomorrow night's dinner.. I think it will be fantastic!  Thank you for posting this great recipe.

I increased the honey and oil and marinated the chicken overnight.  I used the full amount of marinade for two chicken breasts.  It turned out well though seemed to be missing something.  Maybe it needed some red pepper flakes?

Just made this today for 4 of us. We all really liked it and I'm impressed at the flavor. I was worried about it being bland because of some of the reviews, so I made a double batch of the marinade sauce so we'd have some for dipping. It wasn't necessary (but is good to have anyway for rice, potatoes,etc.!). I DID change one thing: used an entire lime in each marinade batch. Mine got to marinade about five hours. This meal is delicious, very simple quick and easy, healthy, and different. Thanks for sharing it.

This was pretty good.  I used a little less soy sauce, but the exact amount of everything else.  I was hoping for more lime flavor.  Next time I will add more lime.  The chicken was very tender and moist.  My kids really liked this.  I cooked it on the George Forman.

very juicy and tender but a little bland. I doubled the lime juice and honey and added a bit of italian seasoning; it was on the salty side even using low salt soy sauce. I expected it to be a bit sweeter. I'll kick it up a notch with seasoning next time.

This was a pretty good start. I felt it lacked a little flavor, so I may bump it up with more garlic, lime juice and honey next time. Great jumping off point, though!

This was really good. The flavor was subtle but everyone in my family loved it! Will make it again . I thought it could have used a bit more flavor though, so I upped the lime and honey.

One word...YUM!!!  We LOVED this recipe!  Even my VERY picky 9 year old devoured it.  I doubled the sauce, poked holes in the chicken breast with a fork, and marinated it overnight.  I used fresh limes and garlic.  Boy did my house smell good :)  My husband grilled the chicken and it turned out perfect.  I plan on making this for my family when we visit them in Florida this year.  The only thing I will change is cut back on the soy sauce...it was a bit salty.  But WOW!!!  This was AWESOME!

While this grilled very nicely and was very juicy and moist, I thought it was bland.  The flavors just weren't strong enough for me and my family. I doubled the marinade and made a double batch, cooking just half for tonight's dinner.  My intent was to cook the remaining chicken to use in salads and wraps later in the week.  I've decided to let the remaining chicken marinate overnight and have added more garlic, black pepper and a generous dose of cayenne pepper to the marinade.  I'm hoping this gives this dish the added kick we are looking for.  If you don't mind a mellow flavor, don't hesitate to try the recipe as stated.  It does provide a very nice presentation and is very moist and juicy.

Great, simple recipe!  It was full of flavor and ridiculously simple to prepare.  We used fresh lime juice, which really added some nice flavor and squirted it again once the chicken came off the grill - wow!  Certainly much better than the preservative packed, chemically induced junk found in the store!  Will definitely be a go-to recipe when we want something simple, healthy & tasty!

This is delicious. I accidently ran out of soy sauce so had to substitute 1 tb of teryiaki sauce.  Other than that the only other difficulty I had was that the marinade kinda burned a little bit...but it was good.  Thanks for the post.

I only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes and while the chicken was extremely juicy, the flavor wasn't really there. May try again after marinating longer - the slight flavor was promising.

The flavor of the marinade was tastey.  However, the marinade in the store is just as good.  It didn't stick out as an amazing recipe.

This is a great marinade for chicken. I used bone in chicken breast and tripled the marinade. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This was ok, the marinade was flavorful, just the chicken was a bit dry or something.  I guess thats just the nature of the bird.

One of the best marinades EVER.  My husband is a great griller so ours was extra juicy as well.  This ones a keeper.

this was pretty good for boneless chicken (i'm not a big fan of boneless chicken). My husband had the idea of making a sandwich with it and it was great!

I thought this was okay - no better or worse than using a bottled marinate, except probably less sugar. Chicken charred up nicely.

I didn't think this was very key west-y ...but I would try it again. I only marinated mine for about 2 hours, so next time i would try overnight and possibly double the marinade.

This was great! I think I added a little more lime (I didn't measure that part) but even my picky 4  year old loved it!!! Will definately make this again.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly, just used thin sliced chicken breast instead of regular.  I let it marinade for about 3 hours, and it is absolutely delicious.  Very tender and tasty!  Served with rice and veggies on the side...very good combo if you need ideas!  Hubby, who dislikes grilled chicken, even gave it two thumbs up.

Great, easy recipe. I marinated the chicken breast for over an hour and then cooked them on med heat in a skillet in fresh marinade. They were delicious. My boyfriend said this was one to keep! Next time I will try on the George Foreman grill. I was just nervous that the chicken would dry out since I didn't marinate it that long. Thanks for the recipe!

This was hands down the best chicken on the grill I have ever made. I marinated about 2 hours. I didn't have lime, so I used the juice of one whole lemon. I doubled everything except the soy sauce.  It was just as good the next day shredded and added to a toasted bun with spicy bbq sauce.

We really enjoyed this recipe, and it's a nice alternative to BBQ sauce.  I added the zest of one lime, grilled the chicken and served with rice and vegetables.  Thanks!

Will definitely make again!  The only change I would suggest is to marinate the chicken longer so that the flavors of the marinade soak in more!

This recipe is delicious!  I used a bit more honey and bit less soy sauce and it came out perfect for my taste.  I made this in the broiler during a snowstorm and it warmed us right up with thoughts of warm tropical places!

This was a great recipe, and I also added teriyaki sauce, and it gave it a sweeter taste. I doubled the marinade and set the other batch aside and basted the chicken while it was grilling, since I didn't get to marinate the chicken overnight like it was recommended.

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe based on the ingredients list, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I have tweaked it several times but ultimately am happiest with the original recipe.  This pairs very well with rice pilaf or green beans.

This was very good and I think it would have been better if I had marinated overnight.  As it was I marinated for about 4 hours.  I used 2 Tbsp of soy sauce, 2 Tbsp of honey, 1 Tbsp of lime juice, and 2 cloves of garlic.  It had beautiful flavor and was very moist.  Definitely something we'll make again!

Great flavor.  As other reviewers suggested, I cut back on the soy a bit (and used low sodium).  Will cut into strips before marinating next time so the flavor can really saturate the meat.

I thought that the soy flavor was too intense.  I also added some garlic powder.

Marinated it all afternoon and we really loved the taste. I really love to use marinades when we grill chicken.  I made no changes other than an extra dash of lime juice.

This wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. I let it marinate for 8 hours. Next time I will try overnight and add more lime juice.

Even though I marinated the chicken overnight, there still wasn't a lot of flavor.  I even doubled the lime juice and increased the chopped garlic and it still wasn't very flavorful.

Everyone loved it, even the picky girls.  Didn't have honey so I used syrup as someone as had posted also added 1 TBS of apple cider vinegar.  Will be one of our favorites.

This chicken was amazing! I threw it together in the morning and then we grilled it in the evening. Tender, moist and it tasted so good!! Not being much of a cook myself I didn't have honey in the house so I used pancake syrup. (if I ever have to do that again I will reduce the called for amount by at least a third) Can't wait to try it with honey!

Excellent recipe! We grilled the chicken and it remained amazingly tender and succulent. The flavors blended well. Also,some pineapple slices were grilled and they were fantastic on top of the chicken breasts. This recipe was such a hit that we had it twice in one week. Thank you for a great recipe.

I was pressed for time after a busy Sunday and went looking for a fast chicken recipe.  I came across this one and based on the amount of time for preparation and marinate as well as the fact the I had all the ingredients in hand I went for it.  The chicken was very moist and juicy and the flavor was just great!  No one even wanted to add BBQ sauce or anything else to it.  Was wonderful as is.  Thank you Tina!

Delicious! Simple and different.  Because I didn't have time, I marinated for an hour and it was still very flavorful.  I cooked it on the stovetop and the marinade made the perfect sauce. I sliced my chicken into thin slices to absorb the marinade quicker and the lime made the chicken very tender too. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Great recipe.  I doubled the marinade and left it on the chicken in the fridge overnight.  Hubby barbequed it just perfectly (not overdone).   Great flavors!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this chicken.  It reminds me of what I get at a famous restaurant.  I added more lime juice and a bit more honey.  It came out so tender.  I will be using this recipe for a long time.  Thank you for it.  God bless you :)

We followed the recipe as written w/ the exception of marinating the chicken for approx. 4 hrs.  The chicken was okay – nothing outstanding.  Won’t make this one again.

This was really easy and actually had flavor! Sometimes marinades end up not really tasting like anything but this one had a good mildly sweet and fresh lime flavor- a definite success!

Follwed the recipe exactly - I think that there was alittle too much soy - that was the only flavor that I could taste.  Husband loved it - son hated it.  Will probably try again using less soy or increasing the other ingredients.

I pounded out the chicken breast so they were thin, marinated for a few hours and cooked them on the grill they were enjoyed by the whole family.  Served with grilled aspargus and brown rice what a great meal

This marinade is a standard in our house.  It's easy enough for a week night, yet tasty enough for company.  I always double it and use the leftover chicken in a salad the next day.

This was a good, basic marinade.  The flavor was very good but wasn't really exciting.  I will make again.  Marinaded for about 4 hours.

This was only ok but not as good as I thought. I boiled my chicken first than bbq so it wouldent take so long. The chicken was nice and tender but the flavor was a little different.

A solid marinade, though a bit too salty for my taste. I will add at least twice as much lime juice next time.
I also marinated some vegetables with the chicken (bell pepper, zuccinni, and onion) and they grilled up nicely as well.

Good, easy marinade.  Don't need any extra seasoning.  Gives chicken a golden brown finish when grilled.

Love this receipe.  I use it every time we have a BBQ and it always received rave reviews.  We use chicken thighs instead of breasts because it comes out less dry from grilling.

We were really impressed with this recipe, especially the fact that it only needed 30 minutes to marinate - most recipes call for much longer prep time. I added one teaspoon of grated fresh ginger - I think it could have used a little more, but I'm a huge ginger fan. Definitely a keeper!

GREAT marinade - chicken was very tender and juicy - grill on low to keep the juices in.  Thank you for submitting this!

Yum!  I marinated this overnight, and I must admit that I had my doubts on the soy sauce (I'm not a big fan of it).  But somehow, it just blended so well with everything else that was added.  I just did this on my George Foreman grill but I can't wait to be able to grill it on the real thing!

My boyfriend loves this marinade.  Anytime we grill chicken, this is his request.  It's quick and simple to mix up, and it gives the chicken such great favorite.  It's definitely a staple around our house.

Read reviews before making and altered recipe to serve 8.  I used 2 tablespoons of each marinate ingredient, except garlic (used 3 or 4 small garlic sections).  Marinated chicken breasts for a couple of hours.  Guests all raved about the flavour.  Many thanks!!

They loved the flavor of this chicken.  Made as written and marinated it for 4 hours.  It was delicious.  I served it with nectarine radish salsa.  Yum.

This was good, but I sure was wanting to taste the lime more.  I read other reviews, and subsequently added 1 Tbl. lime juice instead of 1 tsp, but it still wasn't enough to be noticed.  I even marinated the chicken overnight.  I would make this again, but maybe next time I'll add lime zest to the marinade.

The flavor was good (family enjoyed it) but the chicken turned out a bit dry.  Perhaps it was because I marinated overnight or because I cut the breast in smaller strips and they cooked too fast.??  Next time I'll try marinating only for a few hours and keep the breasts whole.

A definate keeper. I marinated it overnight and it was nice and juicy.
