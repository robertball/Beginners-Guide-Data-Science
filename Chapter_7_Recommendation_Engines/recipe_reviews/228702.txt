I'd actually give it 4.5 stars because its almost there just needs a bit of extra love :) But we really enjoyed this. Even my Chicken Pot Pie hating husband went back for seconds and reheated it for lunch. Which says to me he only thinks he hates it. Now I did make some changes to the recipe. I'm not a fan of frozen mixed veggies (lima beans eww) so I diced some carrots, onion, celery, fresh green beans, and a steamed diced potato. Added some frozen peas. Sauteed all these in a bit of butter until they began to soften. Then I made the sauce and added it to the veggies/chicken mix. I did add some extra poultry seasoning, parsley, onion powder, sage and a little thyme. Even with the cutting up of the veggies this went together quickly, love the rotisserie chicken. I didn't add any extra flour just let the sauce simmer with the veggies for a while until it started to thicken then filled the pie crusts. I did use deep dish pie crust.  I thought the sauce was a nice kick start to a pretty good Chicken Pot Pie.

My husband (my toughest critique) said it the best, "I didn't even know I like chicken pot pie or maybe I've never had one this good!"

I'll give this recipe 4 stars because it makes for an easy weeknight meal as it uses a pre made pie crust, deli roasted chicken and Progresso Recipe Starters Sauce.  I didn't make any changes except I did bake on the bottom rack as this helps with cooking the bottom crust when using a glass pie pan.

Prior to making this dish I read through the reviews. I noted that some reviews indicated that the sauce was rather thin.  Knowing this issue in advance, I chose to add in some parboiled cubed potatoes -figuring the starch in the potato would help thicken up the sauce.  I noticed that aside from the mention of salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning that there were no other seasonings that came into play, mainly b/c the recipe focuses too much on the sauce for providing the base of the flavour. I don't care for poultry seasoning and left it out.  I elected to add in parsley, garlic powder, savory, and thyme. It's not bad for a busy working parent to make, but if you have the time you'll want to stick w/ a traditional recipe.

This is a really good, quick dish to prepare on a weeknight. I prepared it just like the recipe, but added a couple dashes of pepper. It took me 30 minutes to prepare, instead of the allotted 15 minutes. I account it to stripping the chicken from the bone and chopping it. The only thing I would change for the next time is baking the bottom crust for about 5 minutes before adding the filling, though, it wasn't bad as is.

Yummy! I added a can of diced potatoes, but will make it next time with just a sprinkle of pepper and no salt (tasted too salty) and maybe a 1/8-1/4 cup of water.

Made this recipe with frozen chicken (thawed and cut up), frozen mixed greens and chicken broth instead of the starter since Target didn't carry that particular one. My husband and I loved it!! We're making it again but this time with the starter and will see how we still like it.

For a quick version, this is very good. The sauce was thin, but tasty.

Absolutely delicious recipe.  I love the fact that I can use the rotisserie chicken leftovers.  I made this gluten-free, so I didn't use a prepared regular crust.  I ended up using a gluten-free bread stuffing "crust" instead.  I also thickened the sauce with Pamela's Gluten-Free Baking and Pancake Mix instead of flour.  It was a big hit with my family.  I could make this recipe at least once a week.

Great recipe.  Followed basic recipe, but didn't have a bag of frozen veggies, so chopped onion, carrots and celery and sauteed them in a little butter w/ salt, pepper & a tiny bit of garlic.  Family loved it.

My family loved this, except I did not follow the directions to make it so easy.  I'm sharing this because I think the pie is so much better this way.  1.  Make your own pie crust.  2.  I used my own vegetable mix of broccoli, corn, carrots (1 cup each) - use vegetables you enjoy.  3.  Add salt to taste because it's needed.  I don't think my family would've enjoyed this at all with the premade crust and the frozen vegetables.  The rotisserie chicken was used in my version, and it was fabulous.

Made this according to directions except I added a chopped, peeled baked potato. Family really liked it and it was very easy to put together. The flavor of the sauce was just to our liking.

I made a 10 inch pot pie, so I doubled the veggies and chicken. Fresh carrots, green beans, corn, onion, and few leftover mixed veggies were used. I made homemade crust with white whole wheat flour. Also skipped the poultry seasoning since I thought the flavor was good without it. The creamy garlic sauce gave a great flavor to this chicken pot pie. My family all loved it. I will make this again.

Easy & Delicious!  I added my own seasonings along with a diced potato.  This was really easy and Hubby went back for seconds.  I would make this again. Thank you Progresso Recipe Starters for another easy meal!

I would give it 4.5, the original recipe just needs a parboiled potato or sweet potato to give the sauce the perfect consistency. It was a hit and we will add it to our "easy" recipes.

Not a fan.  I thought the sauce tasted like tin can.  I made individual pies with lattice top in ramekins with homemade crust.  I used my own vegetable mix and added a potato.  I will go back to my own homemade pot pie recipe.

I'll give this 4 stars because of the easy prep and concept for a weeknight meal. I found the recipe didn't have enough seasonings so I added more thyme & sage beyond what the poultry seasoning and Progresso sauce had. I do agree the recipe needs more veggies like celery/potoato to add to what the frozen bag of veggies lack and to boost flavor. I made pie crust from scratch since I had the time. Husband liked the dinner for an easy weeknight meal.

I enjoyed this but my family didn't care for it. They felt the sauce was overpowering. I made this according to the recipe except for the pie crust which I made. It came together very easily and dinner was done quickly!

Yes, it's and easy weeknight chicken pot pie. It was good, but certainly nothing to write home about. I think it would benefit from some additional seasoning and additional veggies (onion, celery, potatoes). It was somewhat lacking in flavor.

This was easy and tasted good. I added potatoes and fresh veggies that I had on hand. (I boiled them for a few minutes) I couldn’t find the Progresso sauce, so I substituted a Campbell’s sauce mix. My husband wished the sauce was creamier, so next time, I think I will use chicken broth, milk and flour and skip the sauce mix.

I added more chicken seasoning & California style garlic salt with parsley. It came out really good but too runny. next time, I will double the amount of flour. I also used 24 oz. of veggies for the deep dish. I brushed the top crust with egg wash for a darker, crispier crust. Used deep dish, dark purple pie plate so the crust came out perfectly browned all the way around. Used middle shelf in oven. Took me 40 minutes.
