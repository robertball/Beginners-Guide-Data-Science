After making this custard, I read the reviews and saw a comment relating this custard to a yeast infection. After eating this custard, I would like to tell you that if you follow the directions PROPERLY, it will NOT have the consistency of a yeast infection, although I'm not even sure what that looks like. Even if you are the worst cook ever, which I classify myself as, it should not look like a yeast infection. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Hello! If your custard looks like a 'yeast infection', it is because you added too much warm milk into the eggs too soon. Because of the hotness, the eggs will cook. You need to add the warm milk gradually to avoid scrambling whilst raising the temperature. (I will rate it a 5 because I want to post some help ^^)

I used 5c 2% milk instead of whole milk, 2tbs butter, I didn't have any vanilla so I didn't use any. Don't miss it. I used 4 eggs+4 yolks. 
I used almost a full cup of sugar. My boyfriend likes his sweets??
I used 4tbs of corn starch
After it was ready I added 3 smashed banana's & 5 banana's sliced into pieces. It's my first time EVER making a custard. Delicious

It looked okay however the consistency was like a yeast infection and the colour was to. It tasted like scrambled eggs. Should have read the reviews! Waste of money time and ingredients. Please try any other recipe but this.

Followed this receipe perfectly and it toward out incredible! I did add the extra sugar that was suggested and it made a quick easy family dessert...which is a must for a Family of Five! It kept a smooth consistency and set up quickly...will make again soon!

I did half the recipe (2c milk/2eggs etc.) Turned out good I decided to make it a bit sweeter as well. I accidentally cooked it too long and it had a curdled/lumpy texture but that was easily fixed with a hand blender. The hand blender also whipped some air into the custard which made it fluffy but took away the thickness of regular custard. Would use this recipe again but next time will be a bit more patient with the cooking process.

Made as directed with the following exceptions.
1)  I added 2 extra tablespoons sugar.  Wish I hadn't, as it was plenty sweet enough.
2)  Let the milk/butter/vanilla mixture cool, then added it a little at a time into the egg mixture while whisking vigorously.  (Instead of adding the egg mixture into the milk.)  This way I was able to make sure that the eggs didn't cook too quick.  
Served this warm over fresh berries, then topped with freshly whipped cream with almond extract.  It was awesome!

One of the easier recipes for custard. I tempered the egg well but still the texture wasn't what I wanted. I will try it again.

I needed a not-too-sweet custard for a trifle I am making - so this was great! When I realized I only had fat-free milk - I used 3 cups of fat-free milk and 1 cup of half and half - still came out great! Thanks!

Perfect and so easy to make! I made mine with 2 extra tablespoons of sugar added and then when it was cooked (mine took more like 20 minutes to coat the back of a spoon) I ladled into custard dessert cups put in fridge for 4 hours then sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon just before serving. It made 7 one-cup servings. I found the grandsons and son-in-law raiding the leftover just before bedtime. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Not too sweet. I used vanilla bean to flavour. I prefer the appearance given by the vanilla seeds..

WOW this stuff is the bomb. I needed something delicious to serve my cousin and her family that I haven't seen in years; for a light brunch. At first I wanted to do a quick fruit salad but the peaches and apricots  were so dear I could only afford 1 peach and 2 apricots and a small box of strawberries. I cut them up and saw there was not enough for 6 people. I truned the allrecipes for something to expand the amount and found this custard. I made a half amount and after it cooled folded in the fruit. I served it in wine glasses and it was the best treat ever.

This was an easy recipe, and very tasty.  I warmed the milk, and added very gradually to the egg mixture while constantly whisking.  The consistency was perfect.

Awesome and very easy recipe. I've always put off making homemade custard because I thought it would be difficult. 

I used the recommended amount of sugar but found it too sweet. I will use less next time. 

It was very creamy and delicious. My partner, who does not like sweets, really loved it. 

Mix the egg/cornstarch in very slowly and keep stirring the whole time. It was very smooth that way.

I made the recipe exactly as written plus two tablespoons sugar and we loved it. It was great plain but I made a trifle that included pound cake this custard cool whip and fresh strawberries and blueberries. It was a huge hit. The custard tasted like creme brulee to me minus the crispy top layer. Really yummy and easy to make. A delicious stand alone.

Perfect. I made 1/4 of the recipe for two servings as a topping for apple crumble (aka apple crisp), the way my Irish mum used to make. Much better but quite like Birds brand English custard.

I have made this recipe twice. Both times it came out great. I used it in cakes for a filling, and had no complaints. Also sweetened it up a bit. Easy and tasty.

The recipe seems to be accurate. I might not have ever tried custard before. I've had flan & cheesecake! I decided yesterday that I would try to make it. I added maraschino cherries at the end. Think I will serve it with whipcream. I thought about sprinkling nutmeg or cinnamon but didn't! I'm going to look up a tapioca pudding recipe next.

Lovely custard!  This was my first time making custard. It came out perfectly!  No curdling or lumps. Just be sure to follow steps as directed, especially adding the egg mixture very slowly while whisking constantly. Will definitely be making again!

I have made this exact recipe twice now and it has turned out perfect and yummy every time. As for the individual who reviewed it as the consistency of a yeast infection and taste of eggs they must not have followed the instructions properly. It has a distinctive creamy vanilla taste...it will appear in a creamy off white/yellow color...my children loved it and ask for it instead of ice cream...it was nice showing my kids what I grew up eating instead of ice cream. This is a very easy recipe to follow and execute. Definitely a cheap and easy treat to make. 5 stars

This receipe sounded good but it never got thick. It was just very runny. Next time I will use flour and not corn starch.
