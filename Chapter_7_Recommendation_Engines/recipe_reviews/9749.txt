As most Swedish sprits doughs this dough needs to rest in a cool place for at least 24 hours. Otherwise the cookies gets dry and are not very tasteful. These Spritz are very nice when you do that.

This was the worst spritz cookie recipe I have ever used.  You do not have to grease the pan, there is plenty of butter in the cookies to keep them from sticking.  I got 22 cookies not 6 dozen.  It was obvious when mixing the batter that it wasn't going to make 6 dozen.  I'll just go back to my Better Homes and Gardens cookback!!
