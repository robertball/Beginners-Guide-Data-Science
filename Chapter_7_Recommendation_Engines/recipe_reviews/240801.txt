Mine took 18 minutes at 425.  The recipe doesn't call for salt which it needs a little of. Also, this makes 12 regular sized muffin pan yorkies. It does say "large" but I think the submitter meant the Jumbo size muffin pan.

If you haven't got time to wait for it to get to room temperature just give it a quick blast in the microwave and stir every 15 seconds until it has reached desired heat.  I find three lots of 15 second blasts works great!  Thanks I found this a great recipe.

So easy to make and always comes out perfectly.  It seems to work best for me at 415 for 15-20 minutes.  It is now our staple whenever we make prime rib or lobster newburg!

These were super simple! This is the first time I’ve had Yorkshire pudding and it was great! I used bacon drippings instead of oil and they turned out with some good flavor. I would have taken a picture but they didn’t last long enough!
