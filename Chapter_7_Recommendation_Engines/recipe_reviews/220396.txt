These are wonderfully fabulous! Soft, but interestingly crispy texture. I read the other reviews & couldn't help but giggle. There is NO WAY these could have gotten a bad review - not to be offensive, but they do not taste like baking soda & are not dry at all. I respectfully feel that it's a possibility there was a mismeasurement & some over-cooking going on. Tasty tasty tasty! I will make these again & again. The add in of the chocolate chips was genious & I will definitely try the Craisins add-in next. These little honies are magicians with a good disappearing act around my house! P.S. That's my photo featured on this recipe ;)

This recipe has also been passed down from my Great Grandmother & is a family favorite.  We always called them Texas Ranger Cookies, although no one from my family has ever lived in TX.  Instead of butter my family recipe calls for 1 cup shortening (either plain or butter flavor).  The corn flakes (2 full cups) need to be coarsely crushed (put in plastic bag & roll a can, bottle or rolling pin over the bag). We typically add a full cup of coconut & 1 cup raisins as well.  The recipe doubles easily when making for the holidays & giving to a lot of friends.  These cookies don't have to be soft if you prefer a crisper cookie; we've done both to satisfy different palates in the family.

I used all of the same ingredients and added Craisins (we like the tartness of them).  They were fabulous.  I didn't have regular corn flakes but the sugar frosted flakes worked just great as well.  Quick and easy to make and quick to bake and cool for a last minute cookie if need be.

quick to make, and very tasty.  To make clean-up easier, I simply mixed the first ingredients, then added the dry in the same bowl.  It was  a one bowl cookie.  Added raisins since they were on hand.  Kids loved them.

I have made these cookies for years, and they are a family favorite. One thing I do to make them extra good, is to make a glaze of confectioner's sugar and fresh orange juice and frost each cookie. It adds a wonderful flavor, and a little moistness to the cookies. Try it!

I found that these had way too much baking soda, it is almost all I can taste :( I can tell that with the soda reduced though they will be amazing so I will be trying it again but maybe with only 1 tsp of soda

These were just mediocre.  I found them to be very dry.  Nothing special at all.  Will not make again.

I’ve made these several times over the years and they always turn out perfectly. I can’t believe that some people are disappointed with how they turn out. They have got to be doing something wrong! I do not crush the corn flakes and I use old fashion oats plus I add a little extra coconut. I do put some nestles semi sweet chocolate chips in also. I don’t measure them but I’m guessing around a cup and a half. They are crispy to bite into but soft and chewy on the inside. Yummy!

I made these with what I had on hand. I used special k fruit and yogurt cereal and did not add peanut butter. The result was a fabulous, crispy, chewy cookie with a hint of cranberry chew from cereal. So glad I went for it!

My Mom made this recipe in the 1970s, and I was excited when I found this recipe.  I made it with Frosted Flakes.  A big hit with everyone.

Excellent!  We left out the coconut this time simply bc we were out. Still amazing.  These have a tenderness and a crisp!  The Frosted Flakes hmgive it such a unique texture.  We never add cinnamon.  Oh, we also added a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips this time.  Not too much. But, yummmmm.

These were very surprising!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some cereal that my family would not eat (Special K).  I used that instead of the corn flakes and omitted the coconut because my family doesn't like that in baked goods!  I followed the rest of the recipe as is and they were wonderful.  My daughter is now requesting these and says they may be the best cookies I have ever made!  Thanks for sharing!

ok, I loved the way this recipe was turning out, but not at all impressed with how the cookies turned out. in my experience baking this recipe does not have enough flour. cookies fell flat and looks like a pile of mess. flavor is great but if I make it again I will be adjusting flour to cups and not using tablespoons!! might want to adjust the recipe.

These were just ok.  I mean, any cookie is good, but I wouldn't make these again.  I felt like the cornflake texture was "stale" in the cookie and my cornflakes were not stale!
