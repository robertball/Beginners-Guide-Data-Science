Was searching for a recipe for grilled char. This looked easy and healthy so decided to give it a try.  As hoped for, it was simple and easy and more importantly, very tasty.  The only substantive comment I would make is that the instructions say to start cooking the arctic char with the skin face up.  Based on many other recipes I also read before picking this one, all the others started with the skin face down and that is how I prepared it.   Another thing: I decided not to drizzle the recommended 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil over the greens after everything was done.  I didn't feel it needed it.  One last thing:  I did not have mango on hand, but the strawberries and roasted pecans were delicious on their own, along with the char.  Winner for a quick, easy, healthy and tasty way to prepared grilled arctic char

Very easy to make, delicious!
Added a chipotle mango seasoning to the fish before frying.  Added a little fresh Tyme and Tarragon to top off ghe salad and a tbs of the leftover lemon sauce to top the fish.
