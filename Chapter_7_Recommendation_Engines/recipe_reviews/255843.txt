I like the vegetables incorporated into this dish, but it's lacking seasoning and flavor. Perhaps adding some sautéed garlic, Italian seasoning, and a homemade Alfredo sauce would improve it. I also would suggest a different cooking technique for the chicken.

I added cream cheese and grated parmesan to the store bought alfredo sauce to make it more rich and flavorful.

I made this with minor changes, I used 4 chicken breast (2.75lbs) that I sautéed instead of boiled (with minced garlic). I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. I used 2 jars of Alfredo Sauce instead of 4 and it was the perfect amount.  I then topped with shredded parmesan cheese before baking (uncovered). This is one of my husbands favorite meals now.

Thought it was very good. The heat from Rotel was nice and I used Classico Asiago Romano Alfredo sauce worked very well with the pasta and chicken. I used fresh ground black pepper which also gave me a nice warmth to the dish. Thanks for the recipe.
