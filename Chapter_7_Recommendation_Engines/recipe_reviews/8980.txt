SCORE for Richard!  This meal rocks, and I am so glad I found it here!  I used a 9 qt. coated cast iron pot, which after reading the raters, I knew it would need.  I used a 4# bag of boneless skinless thighs, so easy and less fat.  I added all the 5 link pack of sweet Italian sausage, just because I didn't want to freeze the two left over.  I like lots of sauce, so I added two cans of diced Italian tomatoes instead of one.  I think it's very important to add that after you brown the chicken and the sausage, when you add the liquids you need to scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the pot while you stir.  I don't care for rosemary, so added dried thyme in it's place.  Also, after simmering 25 minutes, I uncovered, skimmed off the fat, and simmered another 30 minutes uncovered till the chicken was tender, but not mush.  I also doubled the mushrooms just because we all love mushrooms in my family. When it was done, I added a slurry of 1 Tbl. cornstarch in 1/4 C. cold water and added while stirring the pot.  This gave it a thick smooth consistency which stuck to the egg noodles very nicely.  My husband and sons raved!  I will be making this for company or family get togethers, for sure.   Thank you soooooooooo much on your very different but delicious twist on Coq au Vin!!!!

Superb dish! This should get more than five stars. Used chicken thighs and followed the recipe to the letter. My husband thought it was excellent and could not stop talking about it all night. Served in a bowl with some crusty French bread to mop up the sauce. The flavors were incredible. Recipe was easy to prepare. This was a perfect fall dish. Next time I am going to add more Italian sausage. (I used scissors to cut each link into slices). Left the skins on so there was a little bit of oiliness but my husband liked it that way and think the skin added to the rich flavor of the dish.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  My 'twist' on it: I put 1 cup of wine in a saucepan and simmered until alcohol was evaporated. I did not flour and precook the chicken...I just added all raw ingredients plus the wine into my crockpot and turned on high for 3 hours. When the chicken was done, I made a roux of flour and water and whisked it into the crockpot. Just prior to serving I mixed in 1/3 cup of parmesean cheese. Served over mashed potatoes. SO SO SO D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!

Super tasty, great if you are looking for a nice dinner to impress with.  I used boneless chicken breast, not a dark meat fan.  First time I left the breasts whole and served with garlic mashed potatoes.  Second time I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and served it over pasta.  Great both ways!! Does make a lot too.

This went over very well at dinner tonight. And I even made a little mistake while cooking this. I split this into 2 pans on the stove-top and used 1 can of tomatoes (which I used diced tomatoes opposed to the whole ones) to each pan, but forget to double the already prepared ingredients (didn't know I was going to wind up using 2 cans). Next time when I make it this way, I will leave the carrots out completely (personal preference), add extra mushrooms, onion and garlic, and add some sliced zuccini and maybe some sliced black olive for color. When the chicken was done, I removed the chicken and sausage from the pan and added a little flour/water mixture to thicken the sauce up. Served this with pasta (smothered in the sauce from the chicken of course!) and stuffed artichokes! The whole family went crazy!!

I have made this several times and my family absolutely loves it.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband requests this several times a month.  It is easy and if there were ever any left it would make great leftovers.  I use boneless skinless chicken thighs, and cook much longer than the recipe calls for, probably another hour or so.  That way the meat absolutely falls apart and the sauce really soaks into it.  I usually omit the carrots, to help lower the carbs.  For my husband who doesn't have to watch his carbs, I serve over rice. Great job, richard, Thanks for our family staple.

Delicious, especially on this early fall night. I didn't have sausages, so I threw in some sage and thyme. I also slow-cooked it for about an hour -- I like the meat falling off the bone -- and served it over pasta (like Italian goulash!) and more mushrooms. Do have bread on hand to mop up the sauce. Yum!

This was excellent.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and diced Italian Style tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. I agree with other reviewers who said to be sure and use a big pan.  I used a stock pot - better too big than too small!  I served it with mashed potatos and a salad and it made a wonderful meal.

A great twist on the classic coq au vin made with bacon. I lightened it up by using well trimmed skinless, boneless chicken breasts and turkey sausage. I also thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch. Great over whole wheat pasta!

I scaled this recipe down for two and omitted the wine (I didn't have any).  It was absolutely delicious!  I will definately make it again but will add the wine next time.  I also thought about adding cubed apples to the sauce instead of carrots...worth a try.

This was excellent.  I used fresh tomatoes as that is what I had. I added a splash of chicken stock to make up for the lack of juice from the canned tomatoes. I also used boneless chicken breasts, again what I had on hand, and reduced the simmer to 20 minutes. This is going in to the definate 'do'er again' pile.

So Yummy. However no one has a skillet this big!?  So I cooked all the meat and veggies in separate batches, then put all of it in a cast iron pot, put it in the oven at 400 for about 40 minutes.  (I preheated the pot and tomatoes at 400 while browning everything else, that way it didn't cool down and sped up the oven time).   The sausage really makes this special!

WOW!  I can't explain how much I love this recipe!  I made it exactly as written the first time, it was wonderful!  Now I've evolved to substituting browned whole baby onions (Julia Child, thanks!), browned small whole mushrooms, 1 can Italian flavored diced tomatoes.   I have made this with red cooking wine - it was great.  Chianti - it was great.  Burgandy - OMG excellent!  Syrah - it was OK.  Cabernet - OMG excellent!  This is definitely - both one to keep and to share with friends!!!

This recipe was great . I made it for a birthday dinner. Instead of simmering for 35 min I put everything in a baking dish and put in the over on 300 for an hour. It was wonderful.

This came out soo so good.  I didn't expect there to be enough liquid (I read the ingredient list like 5 times), but it really was fine.  I brought some to work to share with a friend and found the empty tupperware with a post it note that said 'LOVE IT' on top of it.  I increased the mushrooms.  I used a pinot noir, which I believe is one of the best kinds of red wines to use for coq au vin's.  Next time I'll break up the tomatoes, or make sure that they are completely submerged in the liquid so they break down.  I also hate rosemary and used someone else's suggestion and used thyme instead.  Worked out great.  The chicken comes out soooo tender and the coating with the poultry seasoning is sooo good.

This was good.... I used baby carrots and whole button mushrooms and hot italion sausage for a little kick.
But, FYI, there is NO WAY to fit 4 pounds of chicken into a large skillet with everything else... and then expect to STIR it, too!
I ended up having to transfer half the dish into another large skillet (from a dutch oven no less) and still, it was a bit more crowded then I would have liked. Next time I will cut the 
amount of chicken in half and leave everything the same. But still, wonderful aroma and a very lovely dish.

Sounds like it was written by a really good cook, someone who knows what happens to chicken when white meat is overcooked. I'll give this recipe an A+

Pretty good. Prefer it with white wine, and thyme as well as rosemary (just a little bit of each). With some nice crusty bread, this makes for a hearty comforting meal. Thanks!

After reading thru many of the reviews (didn't quite have the stamina for all 160+) here was my take.  1/2 the meat, everything else the same.  2 Italian (Tuscan)links cut in half long-ways, then into slices browned in about 3 tbsp EVOO and removed from pot.  3 BSCB pounded to an even thickness, cut in half and  shaken in a bag with flour, poultry seasoning s&p and browned in the EVOO & sausage drippings, then removed and covered. Add garlic and 1.5 cups wine (Cab Sauv), 1/4 cup chicken stock and cook 2 minutes while scraping up the browned bits from the pan.  Add tomatoes (diced Italian), onion, carrots, mushrooms and Thyme (more traditional for Coq au Vin than Rosemary). Returned Sausage ONLY to pot, covered and simmered for 40 minutes. S&P to taste.  Add chicken back to pot (with any drippings) and simmer for additional 30 minutes.  Added a quick slurry of the remaining flour and water.  Served with mashed potatoes and good French Bread.  Reviews ranged from good to excellent, with an avg. rating of 4 stars.  Your mileage may vary.

I've made this about a dozen times.  Absolutely perfect.  Usually serve it with mashed potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes and wilted spinach sauteed with minced garlic and onions.  I add a sprinkle of lavender to the recipe to give it an herbs Provencal flavor.  Delicious every time, thanks!

Delicious recipe. Super easy and quick to prepare. I served it with pasta which was okay but I guess it would be (much) better with a creamy herbed pollenta...*sigh* well for next time anyway !

AWESOME!!! This was sooooo delicious! My fiance & I were homebodies today. Being at home lent itself perfectly to making a slow cooked meal (not to mention that I was gifted w/ a 6.5 qt. Le Creuset dutch oven for Christmas!) - and boy was this a winner!!! :-) I did change things up a bit, tho. I followed STARDUST's cooking direct. w/ the except. of 1 step... After browning my sausage & veggies, I deglazed my pan w/ a about 1/8 c. of wine (I used a Chiraz). I then added my UNDRAINED tomatoes (Italian-seasoned diced) / remaining wine, & proceeded as direct. My only other changes were to 1/2 the recipe, use thyme instead of rosemary (personal preference) & add 1 T cornstarch dissolved in 1 T (cold) H2O at the very end in order to thicken. I purchased a 1.5 lb. pkg. of 2 bone-in split chx. breasts & used my local Italian grocer's homemade HOT Italian sausage for some kick (which was plenty for the 2 of us). My only suggestion for next time would be to omit the mushrooms alltogether (I used baby portabellas, but realize that it doesn't matter WHICH variety I use, I hate them all!!!) & sub. w/ more carrots. I just love the sweetness they add to the dish! Oh, and I ended up browning my chx. for 8 min. instead of the recommended 4-5 min. Served over garlic mashed potatoes (i.e. refrigerated Country Crock) w/ French baugettes on the side. Next time, I'm going to make my fancy Gruyere taters (yum, yum!).  Thx. SO much for sharing your version of a wonderful classic, Richard. :)

This was SO good.  Per other reviews, I adjusted as follows:  browned the sausage, removed, browed the cut up , flour coated chicken, removed, then sauteed the veggies.  Put everything together & simmered 1 hr.  I cut the recipe in half but left the wine & tomatos for the full recipe. I wouldn't have wanted less liquids.   Served with mashed potatos.  Half a recipe was MORE than enough for 3 adults, with a lot of leftovers.  Next time, I'll use hot Italian sausage just for a little heat and serve with Garlic Mashed.  Love it!

Very good. We served this for company and they thought it was great. The next day I used the leftover sauce spooned over some rince and it was fantastic. I used bonless skinless chicken breasts and didn't have any issue with dryness. I highly recommend this recipe.

A suggestion for those without a large pot: brown the chicken twice as long, then remove the chicken parts to a plate while preparing the sausage and vegetables.  After adding the wine and tomatoes, put the chicken back in the pot.  Proceed to simmer as the recipe suggests. (You can sauté a tablespoon of flour with the vegetables to make a thicker sauce.)  We enjoyed this meal.

Ohhh, so yummy!  We had guests over the night I was making this - they had already eaten, I knew, so this was just going to be for my husband and I (we were running a bit late).  But it wasn't long before they just couldn't resist getting themselves a serving - it smelled so dang good!

Nice recipe. I made the mistake of not removing the skins from the chicken so it came out oily. But overall, good tasting and I will make it again.

Richard, you're a genius.  This recipe is GREAT!  I fudged a little with the chicken, using chicken breasts, but otherwise kept true to the recipe.  I had friends over for dinner and they all left with the recipe.  No lie.  I also made it again the following night at my husband and son's request.  GREAT!!!!

I LOVE THIS DISH!  I used a cheap $2 wine from Trader Joe's, left out the mushrooms (don't like them), and used fresh rosemary from my garden.  It came out tasting awesome, was easy and fun to make.  Got tipsy from drinking the wine while cooking :P

Excellent. Used the exact recipe. For the meat used drumsticks. Will try thighs next time. The Italian Sausage is the most expensive ingredient, and, if cost is critical, could be replaced with a teaspoon of sweet paprika. The rest I would do the same, next time. It's really easy to prepare. While you are cooking, the house smell good too. Maybe it's just the wine :-)

Wonderful winter night meal. I will give it five stars because the flavor was really there.  Only thing I changed is just used less chicken.  Cooked the sausage first, chicken  then vegetables and combined everything together and simmered on low heat for about 1 hour.  Better even the 2nd day -- served over garlic mashed potatoes

Delicious!  we hit the farmer's market for this one (locally made sausage, foraged wild shrooms, and local chicken).  the chicken is very tasty, so we blew off the poultry seasoning.  we celebrated this recipe's Italian and French influences by opening a bottle of barbera and a bottle of vacqueras!  we put the bright and spicy barbera in the dish, and then had some of each wine with the meal. the vacqueras might have been just a bit better, even though the barbera was in the dish. but either way, you can't go wrong. Tremendous, memorable meal! Grazie et merci, Richard!

I absolutely love this recipe & will make it again.  The sauce is rich & earthy, and the flavors are complex.  I served this "stew" over mashed potatoes & it was heavenly.  

I used legs & thighs, also I thought the sausage would make the dish too heavy so I left it out.  I also left out the carrots.  Next time I'll halve the recipe, because I used my largest skillet and it barely fit, it made enough for eight people.  I took it to lunch at work all week & it smelled so good re-heated in the microwave that my co-workers were jealous.

I have to say, "I really enjoyed this meal!"  My fiance, who loves Italian food, kept saying how good it was while he was eating.  I followed the advice of others and left out the carrots and added about another 7 ounces of tomatoes.  I also added cornstarch to thicken (2-3tsp) and sugar (2tbs) to balance the bitterness of the red wine.  I used about 13 chicken legs for this meal without the skin and the meat was really tender; however, next time I will try with boneless dark meat.  All in all this was an awesome meal and I highly recommend.  Oh and you can get at least 6 serving with this meal.  I served over pasta and with garlic bread.

This is a great dish! We added zucchini and celery with veggies and simmered for about an hour, taking the lid off during the last 20 min. or so to thicken the broth and served over rice.  DH loved it but picky 10 yr old did not! I think the sausage is a big key to the flavor. Thanks, Richard, for sharing this recipe. It's definitely a keeper - a great comfort food!

The recipe took a while because the chicken thighs took far more than 4-5 mins to brown (maybe I should have taken it from the bone). Nonetheless, everyone liked it a lot!

This was really, really wonderful.  I used my largest skillet and took the chicken out while sauteing the sausage and veggies, then returned it before the tomatoes and wine.  I ended up simmering about 45 minutes and then removed the chicken again for a couple minutes and added a Tbsp. of tomato paste to thicken the sauce a bit.  Served it with bowtie pasta and crusty baguettes from a recipe on this site.  I think next time I may put everything in a dutch oven or covered casserole and cook it in a slow oven for a couple hours.  It would be even more magnificent.

I made recipe as written and it was very good. Served over mashed potatoes the first night and stuffing the next night. Definitely liked mashed potatoes more. The house smelled wonderful while this was cooking.

This was amazing!  Ended up simmering for over an hour as we entertained our guests and it still earned raves from all.  Left out carrots (they were in my side) and used the italian style diced tomatoes.  Tough to stir because pan was very full but a couple stirs does it.  Served with wild rice and a medley of steamed veggies. I was told it looked very elegant.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I added celery in one inch slices which I wanted to get out of the fridge.  I forgot about slicing the sausage first so I just broke it into small crumbles which I think added more flavor to the sauce.

What a lovely stew! I used the larger 28oz can of tomatoes because that's what I had on hand, but otherwise I was faithful to the recipe. I simmered it longer to reduce the broth, and served it in bowls over oven roasted dutch yellow potatoes. A great fall dinner!

I cooked this minus the red wine, didn't have any on hand, used white wine & chicken broth combo, we did not care for this taste.  We prefer simpler flavors, I think.  In my opinion, maybe sometimes too many ingredients ruins a dish.

Very tasty!  My only change was 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of one can of whole.  I used b/s thighs so there was no grease that others have mentioned.  Served over mashed potatoes with lots of bread for sopping up the juices.  Oh- and by using turkey sausage it was a pretty healthy meal!

This was very good using canned italian flavored diced tomatos and adding a little extra italian seasonings to the chicken before I coated it with flour. I think without that it would not have been quite as much flavorfull. I used white wine instead of red and used a water/cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. Served over extra wide egg noodles...mmm!

Great recipe! I've never had a traditional Coq Au Vin, but this was so easy and delicious. I made the recipe as is (just thickened up the sauce at the end with a little corn starch and water) and served it stew style with some whole wheat bread! My family and I both thought there was plenty of sauce. This one's a keeper, will definitely make again!

Yummy & easy. Even my picky eater liked it.  I would make it again and even for company.  It would be very easily made ahead and reheated.  The flavor was 5 stars, but the directions were closer to 3 so I am giving it an overall 4.  I browned the sausage 1st, removed from pan and quartered, then the chicken, removed from pan, deglazed with a tiny bit of the wine and then browned the onions and mushrooms.  Added everything back in and then added carrots, wine, etc.  Reduced the sauce and thikened it with a beurre manie so it was more like thin gravy.  Thank you for this recipe.

5 Stars +. This is one of the best recipes I have ever made. I added the remaining flour mixture to the sauce to thicken it a little. Everyone just loved it, I served it with Penne noodles.I used Merlot.

This was delicious! I used chunky crushed tomatoes and Italian seasoning blend in place of the rosemary. I also skinned the chicken and used both chicken breasts and thighs to keep eveyone in my family happy. Thanks so much for the recipe. We all LOVED it!

This was easy and tasted wonderful. We had some quail in the freezer from my husband's hunting excursion last fall so I used them.  I think I overcooked the meat, but had some chicken tenderloin breast meat sauteed separately and that was good with the sauce.  Speaking of the sauce....it's heavenly.  I used some fresh thyme and rosemary (I had them on hand because I grow them)which really enhanced the flavors.  I made a white wine risotto as a side with reggiano parmesano and pecorino romano melted in at the last minute and we really enjoyed this alongside the main dish.  Will definitely make again but not with the small wild fowl; I'll use chicken pieces next time.

My husband and I served Coq au Vin at our wedding reception, so the dish has special meaning for us. This is the first time I've tried to make it myself and it turned out great. I used prosciutto ham instead of sausage and it turned out wonderfully.

This is very good but I'd only use maybe half that amount of chicken .... I still had to cook in stages as others have said.  I added zucchini.  Next time I'll probably add more tomatoes and some broth or something--I like more sauce than this made.  I had it over egg noodles with crusty french bread.  Again, very good.

Just like my Mom's! Depending on the size of the apple, you may need only one. I used a very large Pink Lady.

Excellent! I made this for the family last night and they loved it. I used close to 4# of boneless chicken thighs but I had to brown the chicken in two batches since my largest pan was only 5qt. I followed the recipe to the letter except I used a larger can of the tomatoes. When it was done I poured it over rice and made homemade Buttermilk biscuits to go with it. What a great dish! I am going to add more sausage next time at my family's request.

This smelled wonderful while it was cooking. But the taste was bland and a little off, I am not sure if it was the wine or something else. I do not think I would make this again.

I must admit I left out the Italian sausage, but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter. The flavors melded perfectly, and I found the preparation to be very simple. I chose to serve this with cornbread stuffing, as we aren't potato people. Would be simple to increase for a large winter's meal for company.

I made this for dinner last night.  I used hot sausage instead of sweet, as my husband loves anything hot.  I browned the chicken and sausage in different pans, and then combined them in a pot with the remaining ingredients.  I usually serve my chicken with rice, but served it on mashed potatoes, as suggested.  It was fabulous!  My husband raved about it.

This is a fabulous recipe.  As other people suggested, I cooked the sausage, chicken and vegetables in stages before putting them all together to simmer in a big pot.  I used hot Italian sausage and we spooned this dish over buttered egg noodles--excellent!

Very good. Added more spices and carrots/onions than called for. Made in stages, as others described. First browned sausage, then browned chicken, then cooked veggies before adding everything back into a stockpot to cook. Chicken was done in about 45 minutes this way. Makes a ton!

This was very tasty. I did leave out the mushrooms but that was because my husband hates them. I cooked it in the crock pot all day. I threw everything in except for the wine I added at the last hour also I used white wine because that is what I had on hand, it worked just fine. I served it over creamy polenta. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.  Has a nice flavor of coq au vin but with a twist.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes and put in a little extra by the way of mushrooms, since I like them in sauces.  It came out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! kids, adults- we all loved it and it made a great hearty meal. I substituted smoked turkey sausage for the sweet italian (I don't eat pork) and served with egg noodles. Next time I will make mashed potatoes to soak up more of the incredible sauce! Thanks for sharing ;)

When I first saw this recipe I was intruiged. I had never heard of it, so I did some research on its origins and what to serve with it. I was a hit with my mother-in-law's birthday. However, I added a few more vegetables and used some 5 day old wine. Next time I will use a little more salt and open a fresh bottle of wine. We voted five stars

Excellent - I left out the mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand, and my wife just picks them out anyway. Very good, and uses ingredients that are almost always on hand.

This did not have enough flavor. I ended up adding Sweet Thai Chili Sauce and more salt and pepper, but it was still not very tasty. Needed more heat?? Don't think I will make again.

A very respectable basic recipe.  I followed the recipe (although I used slightly more fresh rosemary) and used skinless/boneless chicken thighs.  It was bland as published. This recipe must require a VERY ROBUST wine. In the end, I messed around with it adding small amounts of balsamic vinegar, extra garlic, and finally sundried tomatoes to give the dish more "punch."  A very nice beginning for someone with a good palate to play around.

This was WONDERFUL!!!  Don't make the same mistake as me though, I put in the whole can of tomatoes without draining them and the sauce came out so watery I ended up adding a can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Even with that, this was so delicious.  Served it with angel hair pasta and even my picky eater liked it, although she ate around the mushrooms :)

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was just OK.  I was dissapointed as it smelled AMAZING while cooking. If I ever make this again, I will make sure the remove the skin from the chicken thighs, as it made the "sauce" very greasy.  We kind of strained the veggies, chicken and sausage from the sauce.  I made this as written, minus the rosemary, as we don't care for it.  As I said it was just OK...sorry!

I doubled the tomatoes and cooked it in my 9 qt. cast iron pot as all others said that it was too much for a regular frying pan.  It turned out great and I served it over egg noodles.  I put the left over noodles in the bottom of a plastic container placed sauce minus thigh bones on top and it froze beautifuly.  Upon thaw I layed 4 cooked chicken breasts on top sprinkle 1 C mozz. cheese and baked for another great meal.

Great recipe. I thought it was very tasty exactly the way the instructions were posted. I will use this again. I served it over mashed potatoes one day and the leftovers over rice the next day and both were equally tasty.

I served this over couscous and it was delicious! This is great as it is so not be tempted to add extra flavor like chicken stock/poultry seasoning. I did that and it came out a tad too salty. But that was my mistake and it tasted wonderful otherwise, thus 5 stars.

One of the best Coq Au Vin recipes I ever tasted.  The only thing I did was to bring up under the broiler before serving to give it a little crunch.  Great presentation.

Fabulous.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added a little chicken stock after the first 25 minutes.  I then thickened it slightly.  This was superb and a big hit at my family dinner.  Everyone loved it.  Very flavourful.  You could do so many things with this recipe.

I loved this!  Rich flavor, super filling, great with mashed potatoes and crusty french bread.  I followed recipe exactly but added extra wine and tomatoes for more sauce.  I was planning on serving over noodles but once I tasted this it was more like a stew than a red sauce, so I made mashed potatoes.  DH didn't care for it, had a problem with chicken and Italian sausage together, but I thought it was fabulous.  Great on a cold fall evening.

This was excellent.  The sausage gave some added flavor.  I added more tomatoes and wine to make more gravy.  I'm making it again tomorrow for my daughter's birthday and Fathers' Day.

This recipe is delicious.  It's relatively simple to follow and produces impressive, gourmet-tasting results.  The great thing is, it's versatile.  You can play with the ingredient list and cooking methods and still get a terrific dinner.  I converted it for a crowd of 60 people by baking the chicken in the oven and adding the sauce of sausage, wine and vegetables to the chicken half-way through.  Served with brown rice and peas, it was a big hit.  Thanks, Richard.

This has been a huge hit in our house.  I've made it with different kinds of sausages - Chorizo has been a favorite, which I guess makes this Coq Au Vin Mexicali.  :)

The most important things to remember when using this recipie: the pan should be industrial size, and serve it with rice or bread so as not to waste any of its delicious sauce. Delicious!

This is a very good recipe and one that I would serve again. You do need a very large pan or be prepared to move ingredients from one pan to another. The sauce is very tasty. I used Rioja wine and a mixture of dark (3/4) and white (1/4) meat.

Served this yesterday for a feast day meal for a community of 16 nuns! THEY LOVED IT! It was so easy and the sisters thought I had slaved away all morning. I used cut up pieces of chicken breast. This will be a favorite! Thanks

This was fabulous.  I cooked it without the sausage and it turned out great.  I used fresh vegetables from the garden.  The presentation is beautiful...full of colour.

Great recipe. I love the combination of French and Italian. The result was a refined, subtle Coq Au Vin. The sauce was delicious and I served it with egg noodles. I only used 4 chicken thighs for the 2 of us, but I did keep the sauce serving the same as written. And it was perfect. I had a little bit of leftover sauce but I had to save it for a well deserved leftover dinner for one with spaghetti. Yum. Will make this again!

Did this recipe for the 2nd time and it was a hit again. Chicken is so moist and tender and the juices are great on mashed potatoes. It's a winner.

I forgot to use the sausage we had on hand, and instead of legs/thighs, I used tenderloins, and decreased the cooking time. It was great! This is definitely a keeper. We served it with bread and just ate it as-is. We used Chianti and that was delicious (both in the dish and in our glasses!) - I'll be making this again for sure, especially to use up veggies from our CSA.

We thought this recipe was really good.  I skinned and boned the thighs to make them easier to eat.  They came out very tender and flavorful.  A couple of small changes, I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I used salt and pepper with the flour. Didn't seem to make a difference.  Didn't bother with the sausage either.  Next time, I would use diced tomatoes, rather than whole, since I ended up crushing them down before adding them to the pan.  Last, I took the cover off for the last 10 minutes of cooking time to get the sauce to thicken more.  I served it over quinoa, but rice or cous cous would also work.

Made this Sunday for our Dinner Club.  Everyone loved it!!  Used fresh thyme instead of rosemary because I don't like rosemary.  Added a TBL of tomato paste to add some depth, & 1 cup of beef broth for the same reason.  Served over rice, would try orzo pasta next time.  Oh  yea, instead of whole tomatoes I used pureed tomatoes, because I don't like the seeds of the tomatoes in my food.

My family loved this recipe! I substituted summer squash and zuccini for the carrots and thickened the sauce with the left over seasoned flour I dredged the chicken in. After reading previous reviews, I made sure to serve french bread as a savory sauce sweeper. What a hit!

Update:  used BSCB and turkey Italian sausage; added cut-up red potatoes with skins.  Double OMG.  Original:  OMG!  This was sooooo good!  I don't usually cook with any kind of chicken except boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but decided to try the dark chicken for a change.  (BSCB can get b-o-r-i-n-g.)  Well, I bought a package of chicken thighs, bone-in.  Wow.  I don't know if my package was any different, but I ended up trimming a lot, eventually ending up with about 25% waste (skin and fat).  So, I decided to use half chicken thighs and half BSCB.  The only other change (that I can recall) was that I crumbled the sausage instead of slicing.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.  Delicious.

This was AWESOME...I love the smell of the red wine, rosemary and garlic all simmering together. I used chicken thighs and one chicken breast since I prefer the white meat. Also, used spicy italian turkey sausage. I browned them first in olive oil and garlic, took them out and then sauteed the vegetables and added all the meat back in. This is a great meal to serve company and have them think you spent hours in the kitchen!!

Very flavorful, yet pretty simple.  I was afraid the wine sauce would turn off my 10 year old, but she loved it and smothered her mashed potatoes with it.  Some simply sauteed swiss chard from the garden completed the meal.  I did use a teaspoon of minced fresh rosemary for the 1/2 tsp. dried.  Also, I had to brown the chicken in batches and then remove it from the pan while I sauteed the sausage and vegetables.  I then returned it to the pan and finished cooking the dish.  I used mixed chicken parts and the white meat was moist and delicious.

This was a wonderful dish.  My mom asked me for the recipe.  I used bone-in skin-on thighs and I recommend that.  Next time I will leave the sausage pieces bigger.  So fast, so easy, so delicious!  I served it with spaghetti.  Perfect!

Loved this! I followed other people's advice: used a larger pot, cooked longer. I left out the sausage as I didn't have any. A tip that may or may not have affected the recipe: I reduced (simmered on low) the wine while prepping everything else.

So delicious and savory - this was an instant hit with my boyfriend and I. I now have a giant potful of delicious coq au vin that I will be eager to eat as leftovers. The only changes I made was to use 3 lbs of chicken thigh meat (instead of 4), and I also used kielbasa sausage that is not sweet. The rest is as. Bravo!

Fantastic!! This was sooo yummy, I made it exactly as the recipe said but used diced tomatoes and venison sausage (because that's all I had in the house. Then served it over a mound of mashed potatoes and green beans, even my pickiest eater licked the plate clean! Would definitely recommend and will definitely make again! Thanks!!

Made this last night for my mom's birthday dinner and it turned out fantastic.  It looked, smelled and tasted delicious.  It was easy to prepare and made a lot.  I added a 28oz can of tomatoes, substituted zuchini for mushrooms, Italian seasoning for the rosemary and used a pinot noir.  I also added a bit of sugar.  Will make again=)

Have made this a couple of times using boneless, skinless chicken thigh meat.  This is a great, hearty dish for cold winter nights!

Super recipe- I made it with bone-in chicken breasts because that's what I had.  I just let the veggies cook a bit before adding the chicken so it wouldn't get dry.  Thank you for this recipe!

I served this recipe at a dinner party, and everyone asked for the recipe.  I did sub thyme for the rosemary, and used Pinot Noir wine as other members advised. Will make this again, and again.

I omitted the sausage and it still tasted fantastic.  Although I don't know what an authentic coq au vin really tastes like, I still really enjoyed this recipe.  So much so, that I made it twice in a week!

We loved this more than classic Coq au Vin.  I too doubted that there would be enough liquid for braising so I added a small amount of chicken broth, about 1/4 cup that is the only variance, but I don't think I would do it next time. I served it with Easy Polenta from this site (left off the tomato sauce) and the combination was wonderful.

Very tasty!!!! I did not have the italian sausage on hand, so I replaced it with chorizo. I liked the chorizo, but hubby is not a fan of it. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and served this over potatoes. I also used white meat chicken and had no problems with it drying out. This dish has a lot of taste and I will be making this again and again! Thank you!

This recipe is fabulous.  It is one of those classics that is great as is.  But can be customized with ingredients on hand.  This one is staying in the recipe box. Great hardy Fall and Winter meal. Along with the recipe ingredients, for quantities I used 12 boneless/skinless chicken thighs. 6 sausages. 28 oz can of whole tomatoes. 6 large garlic cloves chopped.  1 tsp fresh rosemary because it was in the garden, 6 slices of bacon diced and fried off the fat before adding. The bacon added another layer to this dish. I had to add the garlic when the tomatoes were added to avoid burning the garlic. Like the previous reviews I added double the tomatoes, double the wine, used a dry white, and after cooking the dish had no cornstarch so had to resort to making a melted butter and flour roux to add for a little thickening. I did not have a stove top pan suitable for this dish so when the stove top frying was done I transferred the dish to a 9 x 13 ceramic casserole dish and cooked at 320 for an additional half hour.  So much flavour and so tender. The family loved this served over rice.

This was good we we cleaned out the pan!! I followed the recipe but at the end I thickened with chicken broth and cornstarch. Served with rice and french bread. Next time I will use fresh rosemary, white wine, throw in a bay leaf and maybe even add some potatoes for a hearty stew.

Oh So Good!  I followed the recipe to the letter and it is fantastic.  My husband and kids loved it.  They ate several slices of bread just to sop up the gravy.  This is a keeper and will be a regular meal for my family.

I thought this was fabulous! My boyfriend thought it was only so-so, and his son hated it, so I can only give it 5 stars. But I loved it and will definitely make it for myself again. Pretty easy to put together, too!

This was easy to make and the taste mediocore. Our whole family was not impressed, but they ate it. I thought the flavor was too bland and the sauce turned out oily from all the dark meat.

This was great.  I had to use canned mushrooms though.  Also I believe this would be great made as a stew, cutting the chicken in bite size pieces and adding cut-up potatoes and green beans or peas.  It would serve a crowd very well and I am planning on making it for one of our football parties during the season.

Made some minor adjustments: no sausage, so I used thinly sliced bacon. And added Italian spices instead of rosemary. And no mushrooms in the fridge, so I used an orange bell pepper. Laid it atop ‘Carolina Gold’ rice.

I added cayenne pepper ( I like the heat) and exchanged mild Italian sausage with andouille sausage giving it a low country flair.. I then served it over rice.. It was excellent!

I have never bothered to find my id and password to post but this is worth it.  I followed it "almost" to the letter.  I had to use canned mushrooms because I didn't want to go to the store.  

I used skinless bone- in chicken thighs so cooked it a tiny bit longer than called for.  It was so good and the best part is when your husband says it's a keeper and wants all the leftovers (not much) for lunch tomorrow.

this was very good, even hubby said "you have to make this again". it is hard not getting a complaint when I make anything chicken. my only changes were to add 1/4 teaspoon of thyme, 1 teaspoon of sugar, added zucchini and I browned my chicken in a pan, but afterwards put everything in crock pot on high 5 hours. I was impressed with the flavor.

Pretty amazing, really. The sausage added the spice the dish needed to make everyone beg for seconds.  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and added a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit-- which is a personal preference of mine, but definitely not necessary. Easy to make, and if you buy bone-in chicken, pretty cheap to make as well.

This dish was really tasty and easy to make.  I had to leave out the sausage as I didn't have any but it was still  good.  I served it over noodles. My husband asked me to make it with rice next time so will definitely make it again.  Instead of a can of whole tomatoes I used a can of petite diced tomatoes.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this as written except for subbing a fruity white for the red wine (since that's how I prefer my coq a vin), and it was fantastic.  I did leave the skin on for flavor, but when it was finished, I poured the liquid into a gravy separator to get the excess grease out.

my husband like it, matter of fact we got no left over. and my picky eater 5 year old ate it (over rice), thus anything that passed my little girl's taste deserve a 5 star... i added celery, potato and i used tomatoe sauce cause that's what i had on hand. served it over bread

i am not sure what i did wrong, but the flavor  was a bit off.  not sure if it was the wine or the rosemary. it tasted better the next day, but still not my favorite.  i might try again with different spices.

Delicious! This recipe EASILY fed eight people, with some left over, and everyone was pleased with how it turned out. A little time-consuming, but fairly easy to prepare and definitely worth the wait. I'll be making this again :)

I made this last night for my hubby and he gave this an 8 out of 10! I was impressed by the simplicity of this recipe and had a ton of fun making it. The flavors were really good. I substituted bacon for the sausage and used fresh rosemary as well. 

The only problem I ran into was forgetting to add the mushrooms in with the onion, carrot, garlic & rosemary. That didn't pose too much of an issue. I just added them after everything was in the and gave it a stir. 

I served this with garlic toasts I made out of some french crusty bread. Absolutely delicious!

Not spectacular, but hearty and satisfactory.  I served this with rice, and that worked fine.  Leftovers freeze well.

Yum-Yum-Yummy!  This was sooo good.  We followed other peoples advice and added extra tomatoes and put it under the broiler to crisp up the chicken and served over mashed potatos.  We used fresh rosemary since we have it growing in our yard.  We will make this dish over and over again.  It was Maaa-verlous!

I thought it needed more tomatoes. It is a large meal. I don't think I would make it very often.

Tasty dish. Not something I would serve often because of fat content. I will make again when having company as it serves quite a bit. Was a bit greasy. Next time I will remove skin from chicken. Thanks for recipe Richard!
