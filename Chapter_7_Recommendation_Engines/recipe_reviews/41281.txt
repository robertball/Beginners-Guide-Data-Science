My kids said it was good-but they didn't eat the leftovers. I thought it was too rich.

I made this for a party.  Everyone loved them.  They're easy to cut and serve, unlike most brownies.

Okay...I expected better with all of those great cany bars in it. I prefer chewier brownies and these were cake like. It is a definate 5 if you like cake like brownies though.

Lord help me! These were the best brownies ever!! Not the prettiest as others have also said.  The caramel in the snickers chunks sticks to the bottom of the pan preventing a nice clean cut.  Maybe if I use parchment paper to line the pan next time.  My brownies were very moist and a little chewy, just the way we like them. I  probably undercooked them just a tad, but that was okay.  I did make one small change-I used Hershey's Special dark bars instead of the milk chocolate.  Careful- these are addictive!!

blah!  Has a lot of great things in it, but the brownie mixture was very mediocre.  Perhaps actually using a brownie mix in a box would be good.

The best brownie recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot!  Don't mess with this recipe, follow it exactly--it is perfect.  It made a huge batch, and the center was cooked to perfection yet the outer ones were still soft, too.

Like other reviews I don't think these were near as tasty as I thought they would be with all the candy bars in them.  I don't think they would really be considered a cake brownie as mine did come out semi-chewy.  They weren't near chocolatey for my taste.  My husband's office and a friend loved them and wanted the recipe right away so for that I will give it four stars.  I have other brownie recipes that I will stiick to for our household.

This is a great tasting brownie! They are not the prettiest or easiest to cut, but they are delicious, which makes up for the presentation.
