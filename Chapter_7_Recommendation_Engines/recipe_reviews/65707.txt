This was very good combination.  I did not want to have a "knife&fork" kind of  sandwich so I used sourdough bread and made it into a panini. (see my photo)  I did use a bit of the parm but I also topped it with fresh mozzerella.  It was soooo good.  I have since even used the basic ingredients to make a quick pita sandwich.  I cook the onions in evoo for a few minutes then add the roast beef, soy, and parsley for a minute just to heat it up and into the pita it goes.  Very good!

We had this last night and it was so good. I did make a few changes though. I marinated the meat in the soy sauce mix for a couple minutes, I sauted the onions first and didn't marinate them as long as it says to. And the final change I made was to put mozzarella cheese on the top and broil it for 2 minutes. The only suggestion my husband made was not to broil the bread the first time. Twice under the broiler made the bread a little too crispy. Other than that it was super good and a definite make again.

Unfortunately these did not go over too well in our house. I was the only one that liked them, so I probably wont be making them again. I really like the taste the soy sauce added. I added mozarella cheese and toasted the whole thing in the oven instead of broiling it. Be sure to use low sodium soy sauce though.

Very tasty and good. Make sure to heat the roast beef before you place it on the bread slices.  Also, Go easy putting the olive oil/soy sauce mix on the bread to avoid making it overly oily.
Make these smaller and they are perfect little appetizers.

My family  and I liked this very much a tasty change for a sandwich. I like the fact that you don't use any mayonaise or mustard  just the onion soysauce and olive oil and parsley. great with teriyaki-flavored chips!

This recipe is excllent!  I went to a very high end restaurant awhile ago and they served a prime rib crostini as an amouse bouche that I loved and have been trying to find a recipe to duplicate it.  This is excellent!  I bought store bought crostinis so didn't have to broil them first.  So just brushed with the oil/soy sauce and topped with thinly shaved roast beef, topped with the onion/parsley mixture and topped with provolone instead of the parmesan.  It was soooo good!  Just sent my husband out to buy more ingredients so I can take this as an appie for a New Year's Day party tomorrow.  I bet they will rave about them!
