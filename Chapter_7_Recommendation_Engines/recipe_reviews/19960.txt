Wonderful salad John. I used red onion, red bell pepper for color, lemon instead of lime, parsley instead of cilantro (hate it) my usual garlic and onion powders and served it over some baby spinach. Read how someone rated this low due to under ripe avacados? Don't quite get that, however, just so no one else makes the same mistake, the avacado should be dark and give a bit when you press it. A couple of days in a paper bag on your counter (not in the fridge) will ripen them nicely. Thanks for a great recipe John!

Delicious!  If you cut your avocado in large enough chunks then even the leftovers won't remind you of quacamole.  I used a orange bell pepper to add more color, extra lime juice, dried cilantro (sorry, its all I had!) and added 2T of olive oil.

Simple dish that showcases avocadoes.  I used 4 avocadoes since I was serving 3 of us, and I used more lime juice than was called for to make the dish brighter tasting.  I thought the vidalia onion was a great call; it contributed to the flavor of the sald, but didn't overshadow the mild avacado flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

REALLY good combination!  I chopped the onions, pepper, and tomatoes very small and the avocado into larger chunks, and the result was almost like a chunky guacamole.  If the avocadoes are ripe enough next time I make this, I may serve it with baked tortilla chips as a sort of dippable/spreadable salad.

Loved it! I also added black beans. A tip if you leave the avocado seed in the bowl it will keep the avocado from turning brown.

This sounded like a good idea and I had lots of ripe avos to use. I added 1/2 cup of feta cheese, 1 cup of diced chicken breast, 10 strawberries, 3 chopped scallions, on chopped Fijian apple and some grapes. Served it as a meal on top of fresh spring lettuce. Very tasty. The avo becomes like a creamy dressing when you stir the salad.

This recipe is a keeper!  It is halfway between a salad and a fresh salsa and is a delicious sidedish for grilled meat.  I did not have sweet onion on hand so I substituted 1/4 finely chopped red onion.  The color was gorgeous and the flavor was excellent.  This is the type of recipe where you can make endless variations and it will still taste great.  Thanks for sharing it!!

I loved this recipe!  Being that I'm a huge fan of lime and cilantro, I doubled those ingredients.  I served this to company at my home along with chili, black bean salad, Mexican-style cornbread, and Corona beer with limes.  All the recipes with the exception of the chili were found on this website.  And all were great!  The whole meal was enjoyed by all.

How can you go wrong with this "chopped-up-instead-of-stirred-until-smooth version of guacamole"?  Great with tortilla chips!

Delicious.  Cut all the vegetables except onion into bigger pieces so that it was less of a " chopped salad".  Added boiled shrimp tossed in lime, crushed red pepper flakes. So fresh and healthy.

Nice! I was a little worried about the green peppers taking over the world, but they worked well in this after all. I did add one chopped jalepeno for heat, but made as written otherwise. Thanks for the recipe! :)

So... avocados were on special for $1 each this week and I made the impulse buy for two of them. Looked up recipes and tried this one. Fantastic!!!!!  Only change I made was to cut the onion down to a half because I had a very LARGE onion. Cilantro is my favorite herb and I love what it does for this salad.  I already ate some for lunch and it's "supposed" to be for our dinner. Thanks for a great healthy recipe.

This was easy and quick to make plus it was delicious.  I added my own salad dressing to this which knocked it up to 5 stars. This is an awesome raw vegetarian meal.

The flavor was alright but this just didn't turn out that great. Giving this a three is very generous. Make sure your veggies are ripe; my avocados weren't that ripe and I think that is why this one failed. Otherwise, very simple to prepare.

This was very good! I only made some minor changes: I used an orange bell pepper instead of green (just to add a different color), I used a pint of halved grape tomatoes instead of cutting up one large tomato, and I added some feta cheese (as suggested by another reviewer).  I think next time I will use a little less onion and add a cucumber. Yummy!

This is a great side to grilled chicken or steak.  I used green onions instead of a regular onion and I also used a red pepper instead of green.  Used the leftovers the next day as a topping on nacho chips with melted cheddar cheese.  Delicious!!

I made this for dinner last night. It made enough for three nice sized salads. I used a red onion and orange bell pepper. Salad was very pretty and just fresh lime juice makes it very refreshing. I find when making a lime dressed salad, it is best to let it sit for about 30 minutes before serving, then give a nice toss...brings out the flavors of each vegetable and the lime isn't overpowering.

This was great!  I just made a few minor changes, orange bell pepper instead of green and I used the whole lime.  I then scooped the mix into lettuce cups and rolled them up.  Served with the chicken kabobs mexicana from this site, and I had a light, refreshing, yet very satisfying low carb meal!

This is a really fresh crowd pleaser. Cut down on the onion a little though. I used a orange bell pepper for color and sweet vidalia onion.

Mmmm, so good!  Easy, fast and healthy.  I cut the recipe in half but still used 1/2 lime.  It could've used a little more even.  Love it!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a good salad!  Very easy to substitute things... I used red peppers and lemon juice instead because that's what I had and it was still very good!

This salad is amazing. I made it for the first time and it tasted very good. I was planning to do this salad for my husband, but by the time he got home i had finished the entire bowl:>)

I use lemons instead of limes. Never tried it with the green peppers - but I bet that would be good.

I really like this recipe. It is VERY easy, which is key for me! I used 3 avocados (I needed to use them up), red bell pepper instead of green (what I had on hand), a little extra lime juice due to the extra avocado, and a little bit of olive oil. I am so glad I found this recipe!

This is so good! I don't use the green bell pepper and instead of vidalia onion, I used red onion. I have also marinated chicken breasts in lime juice and garlic and made a chicken salad with it. NEVER any leftovers!

Was good flavor, but I'd probably use a little less lime next time.  The chunks of vegetables were so big that the flavors didn't blend together, I didn't think.  I'll make it again, because I have the ingredients many times, but I may change it around some.

I have made this several times and it is a huge hit! The left overs, if there are any, are good mixed in rice or with a western omelet. I do prefer a stronger lime flavor and usually use the juice of two small limes. I have done it with and without the cilantro and enjoy it both ways.

Straight lime juice was a bit bitter.  Maybe it was the lime?  Next time I think I'll add my standard: cumin and coriander!
I served it on lettuce w/ shredded cheese, and then later as a main meal I added chicken sausage...  Good.

Add zucchini, lightly shake veggie mix with lime juice. This will prevent the avocados from getting mushy.

This was great! I made a few changes though. I used one half of a jalapeno pepper instead of a green bell pepper and added in a few green onions. I will definitely be making this again.

This was excellent!  It is best once you let it set in the refrigerator a few hours.  I added jalepenos and used both lemon and lime.  It was great with tortilla chips.  I will add boiled SHRIMP to it next time.  YUM!

This was pretty good! Unfortunately I only had two smaller avocados... I think it certainly would have been better with more. But still a delicious fresh salad. I took the leftovers and put them in a food processor and made salsa!

This was okay.  Definitely refreshing--that's a good word for it.  It ate it all, but what can I say...it's not really a salad.  It's like eating a chunky (but good) pico de gallo.

This salad was awesome! Perfect pick for a hot summer night. We love to have a salad nights during the summer here in FL and this was a wonderful addition to the menu. Next time I think I will add some corn or black beans and crumbled bacon.

Yummy! Very fresh tasting and a nice blend of flavors. We scooped it onto tortilla chips and my husband also put it on top of his tostada. Even my 2 year old ate it.

Left out the green pepper, but added a little crushed garlic..I squeezed the tomatoe seeds out so it wasn't so watery, used some red wine vinigar instead of the lime juice and added a little extra virgin olive oil.

Light and refreshing!  All ingredients are my favorite so I found this to be an excellent recipe!  I didn't have cilantro on hand but I'll try that next time.  I think I'll even try adding some chunks of whole milk mozzarella cheese.  Yum!

I liked this recipe a lot, using it more as a salsa than a salad.  Could use a bit more heat.

I loved this Avocado salad!  It was so delicious as a side dish, and the next day for chips and dip with tacos.  Very balanced, and will make it again and again...  I used red pepper rather than green to give contrast to the avocado, and juice of one whole lime, rather than half, only because we are partial to lime, but I'm sure half a lime would have been sufficient. 
Thank you for this refreshing recipe!

The salad is great. I made a change to this by adding some sliced pickle ginger to the salad, it compliment the Avo and bring out the taste of the other ingredients.

This one was good, except for the peppers, which I think are too strong and tough. I also subbed parsley for cilantro.

Delicious salad. This recipe was a hit with my company as well. I did not have cilantro so I left it out, and I used lemon juice instead of lime because that is also what I had on hand. Thank you!

A great salad all the ingredients seemed to fit with one another very nicely... I don't know if there is a lot I would change... make sure your avocado is ripe and your onion isn't over powering... when I ate mine I sprinkled a little lemon pepper on top at that was fantastic....

I really enjoyed this salad as a change of pace. I subbed grape tomatoes for the chopped and omitted the pepper because I didn't have one on hand. It was delicious, filling, and healthy (although watch the avocado, which is high in fat). I will definitely make this again!

It makes a lot for our little family, but it's so good that we don't want to waste any, so we almost make ourselves sick trying to make sure that there aren't any left overs. This is a family favorite!

I don't normally like avocado as a main ingrediant but this is delicious!!! I made it for a small dinner party and everyone commented on how good it was.  I left out the cilantro (since I really don't like cilantro) and used lime juice.  Salt and pepper aren't neccessary.  It was a wonderfully refreshing starter salad.

Great, simple side dish.  The only changes I made were using grill seasoning instead of salt and pepper and grape tomatoes because larger tomatoes are not very tasty this time of year.  I served it as a side with a Mexican casserole.

Delicious! A friend served it at a barbeque and I thought it was so tasty I asked for the recipe. Happily, it was from my favorite recipe site! She did use lemon juice instead of lime because that's what she had on hand. Worked fine but I'm going to try it with lime because I love limes. Fresh cilantro is a must!

I didn't have any green pepper or cilantro on hand, so I punted.  I decided to have this as my main meal for lunch.  I added some small shrimp and sprinkled feta cheese on top ... YUMMY!  Thanks for the recipe

Very tasty as a "dip" with tortilla chips.  I love all the fresh tastes - wish I would have had cilantro to use, but it was delicious even without it.  I used green onion both in the salad and as a garnish.

Yummy!  I omitted the cilantro (personal preference) and went a little light on the onion.  I made this as a side dish for Beef and Bean Chimichangas (from this site), but we ended up just using this as a topping instead.  Very tasty, even if it wasn't quite as salad-y as I was expecting by the title of the recipe.  It's more like an avocado salsa or chunky guacamole.  Whatever you call it, it's good eats!  Thanks for the recipe!

To make it more salad-like, I had this with mixed lettuce leaves, diced red onion and sliced radishes.

Refreshing and tasty.  It is a cross between chunky guacamole and an avocado salsa.  I chopped up some fresh garlic and subbed a minced jalapeno for the bell pepper.  We had it over some shredded iceburg lettuce along side some chicken enchiladas, as they serve it at our favorite Mexican restaurant.

This is a wonderful addition to our dinners. I usually serve this with a sandwich, last night we had this with a turkey club sandwich. The last time I made this is was great but it tasted a little bland for us (we love loads of flavour) so this time I used the whole lime for juice and fresh cilantro paste (picture attached)  and two minced garlic cloves. Amazing salad! Thank you for this

As written, I'd give this a 4. Too much onion and not enough avocado. I will definitely try again but I will use someone else's suggestions of using red onion and red bell pepper. I think the green pepper is just too strong. I'll probably add more tomato as well next time. Still, I liked it and will use it as a great starting point to make my own variant

I made this but used a combo of red and yellow peppers because I had those on hand! It was very delicious and was Keto friendly. I will make it again.

I just made this on my own without looking at a recipe. I didn’t add bell pepper tho. I used tomato, cucumbers, avocado, onion, parsley , cilantro, pepper, onion powder, lime, oil and vinegar.   Delicious!

Love, love, love it!  Especially since we have our own avocado tree in the back yard!  Limes can be a bit hard to get here as they have to come to us from South Africa, but I buy, slice, and freeze!  Making this one for supper again tonight!

You're so right Johnlynn....I liked it!!!!  A lot!!!!  Didn't have lime on hand so I used lemon and another thing I used differently was a red pepper...not a fan of green peppers at all.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will be going back to this recipe often.

I made this side dish for my family of four adults, so I added one avocado.  I also didn't use a whole onion, which I thought would be too much, but everything else as stated in the recipe.  Very light and fresh, and easy to toss together!

Very tasty salad...reminds me of chunky guacamole.  Did't have lime juice so replaced it with fresh squeezed lemon juice and added about 1/2 tsp. diced garlic.  Salt and pepper to taste and it was excellent!

I'm going to have homegrown tomatoes this summer, looking for recipes to use them in.  This salad looks great.  I grew up thinking of avocado salad completely different.  My mother mashed avocados with just salt and pepper and lemon juice.  Then mixed it with large curd cottage cheese.  At serving time it was spooned on very thinly shredded iceberg lettuce, then topped with chopped green onions.   It's delightful  it was sort of reserved for special dinners.  It was served ahead of the meal, which is the only time I remember an appetizer being served before our meals.  Sorry I didn't mean to hijack this recipe!

I like it. Wish I could have tasted it with sweet onions. I used escalot onions instead and accidently spilled some of the bowl of lime juice on my kitchen desk in the process, resulting in adding a bit too much lime afterwards, so mines' can get tastier if I don't make these errors.  I consider adding cucumbers in this dish. Thanks for this excellent recipe I enjoyed it!

Very good.  I don't usually eat raw onions, and I didn't think just lime juice would be enough flavor.  But I made no changes, and I thought it was very flavorful and easy to make for just one or two people (just change quantities).

1-23-18 ~Since I was using this as a salsa for Cilantro-Lime Chicken, also from this site, I chopped the ingredients fairly small, and all to taste rather than precise measurements.  I used red onion and eliminated the green pepper as for my taste it didn’t appeal to me because of its strong flavor.  I’m not sure I would appreciate this nearly as much as a salad, but as a salsa for this chicken, it was beautiful.

Loved this salad and so did our guests. I substituted yellow pepper for green & added a small amount of olive oil. Served this with the Spinach & Chicken Enchilada Recipe from this site. Booth are keepers.

I would definitely make this again, but without the fresh cilantro. It was too overpowering for my own personal taste. Otherwise, 5 stars.

Added extra tomato, used 1/2 small vidalia instead of whole, 1 green onion sliced white & light green part only, diced mini-cucumber b/c forgot to buy bell pepper & juice from entire lemon. Salt & pepper to taste. Looking forward to trying as written. Had on top of mixed greens but easier could eat alone. Nice flexible recipe.

Rating it a 4 because of the bell pepper.  Leave it out and it's a 10!!  Hint, use a fairly firm avocado, not too soft.  It will hold up better and not turn to mush.  I toss the avocado separate in the juice before adding anything else.  That way it will get totally coated and not discolor.   I use one large lemon or two small instead of lime.

Too much onion in the salad for me. I will try to use 3/4 onion next time. 
My mom who likes eating onions also has to pick some out to eat.

My first time making an Avocado salad. My husband and I do not care for cilantro, so I substituted fresh parsley. Only used a third of a sweet onion and used Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper. We thought the green pepper was too strong so will leave out next time. Would like to try green onion next time. The beauty of this recipe is that it lends itself to so many variations!  Thank you! Nice job! PaulaO

Love this recipe!  My variations: I used red onions instead (but I soaked them in ice cold water for 10 minutes before dicing them as that takes the pungent smell out of them). I also used sweet cherry tomatoes instead and sliced them in half.

Great salad, like the instructions say use a sweet onion. I would also make sure to chop the onion into small pieces, mine were a bit big so sometimes you'd get a bite of all onion.

Delicious  and  so simple ! ! My husband  couldn't  wait for dinner, and devoured  1/2 of it before  I could  plate it. I did not add bell pepper ,  not a   fan., served atop spinach along side  grilled  pork chops with Italian  toppings   (also on this  site  ). Bravo!

A little disappointed -it wasn't bad, but not particularly good either - I followed the recipe exactly and used quality ingredients,   but it was ho-hum.  I don't think I'll make this particular salad again.

Love it! In Houston we call this "Mexican Guacamole" with the addition of a bit of chopped fresh jalapeno and deletion of bell pepper. It's prepared tableside and is so delicious. I'm thrilled to make it at home now.

I added another avocado and only used half as much onion as suggested. This was a better ratio in my opinion. I also juiced a whole lime and added in some onion powder, which added a lot more flavor I thought.

Great recipe! I halved the ingredients (used juice from half a lime) which made enough for two people and added about a half-teaspoon of granulated garlic. Liked it so much I made it again the next night!

It was good, but it just tasted like chunky guacamole to me. So next time, I'm going to add cucumber for more crunch, and maybe some shrimp to make it a main dish.

Very tasty!  This would make a nice side or lunch.  I left out the cilantro, as my husband hates it - still tasted very good.

LOL This isn't a salad.. this is salsa.

I used to make this all the time.
I don't use bell pepper and I add a couple of cloves of garlic.

This was great!  I added a can of Tyson white meat chicken and it was really good.  I paired it with wheat thins.  My husband is not an avocado fan but he thought it was pretty good as well.

This was wonderful!  I was worried about the amount of onion and lack of "dressing" other than the lime, but it was just fantastic as is.  I followed the directions exactly except I used red pepper instead of green.  Will make again.

I'm trying to eat more avocado because of them being so good for you.  This was delicious!  Only thing I did differently was I had a regular onion rather than a sweet one so I used half the onion.  Yumm!

So good! I am normally not a fan of lime juice and was going to try to use a different dressing until my fiancé tried it and told me it was delicious!.  We opted for bell peppers and some bacon bits and left out the tomatoes.  Seriously so good!

VERY good salad!  I did double the amount of avocado, only used 1/2 a red onion (which was plenty in my opinion), used 1 green pepper & 1 red pepper, a whole lime, added minced garlic & just eyeballed the cilantro.  Additionally, I placed some crumbled queso fresco on the side for people to sprinkle on top & it was pretty much an amaaaazzing addition.  THANK YOU for sharing!

Delicious, a great "south of the border" recipe and wonderful on a warm summer evening. I served it on a large iceberg lettuce leaf and also had some chicken on the side.  My hubby liked it a lot. Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was great.  Used fresh flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro as a flavor preference.  Used red and yellow peppers instead of green because that was what was on hand.  The lime was subtle and added a great overall flavor.  Healthy use for avacados and garden tomatoes.

This is only as good as your avocados, so make sure they are ripe!  Very good, healthy, and easy to prepare.  Useful to serve with fajitas and tacos as a topping.

Liked this and my 4 year old even ate it.  I used a red pepper instead of green, because that is what I had.  I didn't have cilantro so skipped it.  I also didn't put any salt or pepper because it didn't need it.  We ate this as a side with spaghetti.  I will be making this again.

My mom and I loved this recipe.  I didn't have any cilantro on hand, but it turned out fine.  Also, I added about 3 avocados, only a half of tomato and very little onion (I'm not an fan of raw onions).  Very good recipe!
