I didn't have Malaises so I substituted with apple sauce, about a half cup, turned out great. really soft . Its pretty sticky to work with but if you use it to just drop on a cookie sheet or pan its great .  Tin foil in the pan works great . keeps in the moisture

Loved these.  Will make again.  Only change was I added 1/4 t of nutmeg and added extra 1/2 t of ground ginger.  Spice level was perfect fort family.

I added in a little freshly grated ginger giving the cookies a wonderful ginger flavor.  I made half the recipe, using a whole egg therefore the batter was softer than usual and I didnâ€™t roll them in the sugar mixture, simply used my cookie scoop, place them on the cookie sheet and sprinkled with sugar.  The sugar pretty much dissolved during the baking process so I sprinkled them with some raw sugar in the end.  If you like a soft ginger cookie, you should like this recipe.
