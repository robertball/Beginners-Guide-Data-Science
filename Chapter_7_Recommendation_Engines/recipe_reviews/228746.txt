Sazon is a latin seasoning that you can get in any grocery store (walmart included) in the international aisle near the rest of the latin items. It is usually in a box and comes in little packets inside. There are sometimes lots of different ones to choose. I personally go with the red box or the yellow. They are the most basic in flavor profile.

Easy? Too many ingredients to be called easy.
I'm sure it is good but doesn't fill my search for easy quesadilla.

These were really good! I think you could also roll this up burrito style and maybe add some salsa and sour cream inside. Will make this again for a nice lunch!

My family loved this! The only thing I would change is  cutting back on the salt. The original recipe had a little bit of a salty bite to it.  I did make my own Sazon Seasoning because my daughter has Celiac and cannot have most prepackaged seasoning mixes.  So, it may have been the salt from that recipe mixed with the salt from this current recipe that was too much.  Other than that, it was a great hit in our home and will definitely be made again.
