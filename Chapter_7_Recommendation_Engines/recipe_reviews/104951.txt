This is a really simple recipe and quick.  I love it.  I serve it on a bed of brown rice with soy sauce.  I use the low fat spam instead of regular.

Oh yeah, this is the real thing! I LOVED this stuff when I was a kid. Now that I'm all grown up (and a vegetarian),  I like this dish made with a polynesian-style marinated tempeh. Also, try it with either pineapple chunks, sliced and peeled sauteed apples, or "rehydrated" dried fruit like raisins, fig, cherries or apricots. Delicious! Serve it usually over a brown or basmati rice, but I'll sometimes make a nice risotto if I have the time.

Pretty good, like other reviewers say it was on the salty side. Less soy sauce next time, I didn't add the extra salt the recipe mentioned either. I used young kale instead of cabbage. Next time will scramble an egg with the kale and spam.

I'm surprised this is not on the SPAM website... This is a quick and tasty meal ( I served it on white rice). It's so simple and flavorful. Great way to incorporate your veggies. I used 1/2 TBS. of soy sauce and if I needed more added it to my taste while I was eating. Great affordable meal..

very tasty.  I should have used low sodium soy.  I rolled it in wanton wrappers and made egg rolls.  My kids loved them.

A little salty, but very good.  Will use a low salt soy sauce next time.

OMG - I am so glad I tried this!  I did make a few minor changes -- I only bought the small 7oz can of Spam, so I diced and cooked 1 chicken breast with the Spam to make up the difference.  I also threw in a thinly sliced leek (using up veg from my CSA box), only cut up half of my enormous Napa cabbage (should have used the whole thing), and I only added about 1.5 T of low sodium soy sauce.  Oh, and I put quartered grape tomatoes on top of each serving.  SO YUMMY!  I, too, served over rice and will definitely be making this again!

This was a good, quick meal.  I used 2 cans of Spam and a large head of Napa cabbage.  I was surprised at how much the cabbage reduces in volume.  I will make it again.

I don't think the spam went well in this. It would be better with shrimp.

I scramble a couple of eggs and mix them all in together, then sprinkle chopped green onions over the top and serve on top of rice.

This was good! I would use just a little less soy sauce, as this was just a tad too salty. I even used lite soy sauce and SPAM. I would make again--very simple.

Had Napa Cabbage leftover from making Spring Rolls.  My daughter had just brought some Spam home.  This recipe is very good and easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Great idea.

I made this according to the recipe. It was my 1st time using Napa cabbage. Delicious! I think it would also work well with chicken or shrimp in place of the Spam.

I used hickory smoked Spam and left out the soy sauce because I forgot it but my family loved this dish. My dad raced about it and my teenage daughter came in and ate all of the leftovers!

I have never really liked corned beef and cabbage because the cabbage always comes out so mushy.  I am so glad I found this cabbage recipe because I can eliminate the texture of the cabbage from being too soft/mushy.  My family really likes the way this recipe tastes and they also enjoy the bite of the cabbage they can feel when chewing it.

My husband thought their was too much Spam. Since the cabbage shrinks down, the dish is over-come with diced Spam. Other than that, it was really good.

I reduced the soy sauce to 1 T. left the rest as is.  My family ate it up (I served it for St. Patrick's Day).  It really was quick and easy.
