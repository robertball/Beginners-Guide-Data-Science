My twelve year old loves to bake and begged me this evening to make something but we're a day or so out from our grocery trip. We searched by ingredients for a recipe and this came up! Glad it did! These are ingredients I almost always have on hand! The family is very pleased! Thanks for posting! This will be a keeper!

Thank you, Cricket18 for posting this recipe! Years ago my dad told about his mother and aunts making mayonnaise cakes during the war because it was readily available and eggs and oil were not. I wanted to try it and I finally found a recipe from a company, but it called for eggs. I made it per that recipe and it was delicious, but I still wanted to see a REAL recipe without all the extras that the mayo was supposed to replace. I will be going home and making this cake over the weekend! Thanks so much! I knew there was someone out there that must have had this great piece of history to share. (Note, I give this five stars because I know how good it really is!)

I just made the frosting to put on another eggless chocolate cake for which I had chosen.  Since I didn't have any marshmallows, I cooked the milk, butter & sugar for an extra minute (3 min. total time) & then I added the peanut butter & vanilla & whipped it by hand for a couple minutes.  Be careful not to whip too long, as it will be too much like fudge!  Anyway, it came out wonderful.  Since my cake was only 8x8 size, I only used half of it & put the remainder in a jar & leaving lid off till it cools well.  I now have enough for another cake.  I am pretty certain I will just need to warm & stir to make spreadable again!!  Very tasty & I will make again :)
