Followed the recipe and thought it was great!  We paired the rice with the baked soy lemon chops from this site, and it was a huge hit!

I give this about 3.5 stars. It turned out and was easy to make, but mine was really oniony. When I make white rice, I typically make Brazilian rice from this site. I thought I would try something different. It will more likely get eaten, just too much onion taste for me.

I really enjoyed this rice. It was a nice change from ordinary rice. Make sure to use a mild onion because a strong one might overpower the rice. I would make again!

This is the BEST RICE!  So much better than plain white rice and better than prepackaged mixes!  This has become a 'go to' recipe for me!

I will be making this rice again! I made it with 3 cups of uncooked rice and five cups of chicken broth; but other than that followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great.

It is very good. Though many say tastes to oniony, so I cut the amount in half and it was so good.

Love this!!! We didn't want just plain white rice. I didn't use the olive oil, but a little real butter. And heavy on the garlic. Definitely a go to, to change things up.

This rice is excellent as is. I have made it several times. I used it with the Pan-Seared Chicken with thyme from this site and it is an excellent pair!

It's a great everyday staple.  My daughter thinks 'm a chef now.  My only issue now is generating enough chicken stock to fuel the rice.  

I try and pick up a Rotisserie Chicken every couple of weeks for a meal, and to make chicken stock from the leftovers.  The one's from Sam's Club  are the biggest and best for the money.

Ive tried several recipes for rice and hadn't found one I liked until I tried this one! It's delicious and so simple! My husband, who is a very picky eater (he claims to hate onions) had two helpings of this! He loved it! I made it as a side dish to baked chicken and a salad and it was wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

My husband and I love rice and I'm always looking for ways to spice up a common dish. We LOVED this!! He gulped it down and asked for seconds. I replaced the chicken broth with Swanson veggie broth and it was super tasty. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I know people don't like when you change something and review it but I always like to see people's positive variations. I wanted to try this but had no more onions. I knew I needed more flavor and used a cup of chili mix I had on hand and YUMMMMMM!!! Next time I may use butter to toast the rice but I will certainly make this again.
