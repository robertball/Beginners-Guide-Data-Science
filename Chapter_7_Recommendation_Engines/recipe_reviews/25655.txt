Different than your average onion soup but great. I didn't like the smell or appearance (it looks like gravy) and was worried I'd picked a bad recipe but I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked this. I didn't have spaghetti sauce so I just used tomato sauce and it worked fine. I will make again. Thanks!

This is quite good.  If you want French onion soup, make actual French onion soup, not this stuff.  But I highly recommend it, it's really tasty.  Be sure to cook the onions as long as the recipe says.

This is very good.  I used worcestershire instead of soy to cut back on sodium and I also added some red wine to the recipe. I have been making onion suop for years and really enjoyed the addition of the tomato sauce.  Thank you!

This was pretty good...I love onion soup and was very excited to try this twist.  It wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be, but I will make it again.

This is not onion soup it's more of a tomato soup. Had you called it tomato soup I'd give it 4 stars. Anyway this tastes just like a decent tomato soup. Sub out tomato instead of spaghetti sauce. Spaghetti sauce has ingredients in it that I don't think belong with Creole.
