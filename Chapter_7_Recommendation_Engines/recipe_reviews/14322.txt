Very good, but used a 16 ounce bag of shredded coleslaw mix and there was plenty of dressing. Great with chili and "Rory's Most Wonderful Corn Bread" from Allrecipes.

I surprised my wife by cooking dinner and I served this as the salad. We both loved it and will make it again. I used "medium" salsa and I should have used "mild" as it was a litte spicy for us.

This recipe is delicious!!!  I doubled the recipe in only 10-15 minutes of prep time!  I'll be making this again for bar-b-ques for the summer.

I was dissapointed in this slaw.  I was expecting a much more vivid taste...and it turned out rather bland.  It was really easy to make since I used pre-shredded cabbage.

The taste is pretty good.  It is really quick to make and it is easy to make, does not require a lot of time or a lot of ingredients.  I am not sure if children would enjoy the tast of it.  I would say that most kids would like it. I give it a good rating because  I thought it was great coleslaw with a kick.  I added a bit of pepper to mine though to give it some more flavor.  Great recipie for a get together or a cook out.

Easy to prepare, delicious. I never would have thought of adding the salsa to cole slaw.  A nice surprise for the taste buds.

Take a chance - use at least a medium salsa!  This is a nice variation on an old standby salad - especially good with grilled meats.

This didn't have the kick I expected the salsa to contribute, but the taste was quite good and it was simple and quick to prepare.  It drew mixed reviews from the tailgate crowd.  Thanks, Susan!

I thought it would have been better than it was.  Not the tex-mex flavour I expected.  Very easy to make and very saucy.

This recipe was horrible! Too much sauce for all the cabbage in 16 ounces. I'm going to leave it in the fridge for a day or two and see if I change my mind about the flavor.

This was OK.  I must admit that this recipe made me realize that I can go outside the box and change up my old usual recipe.  So next time I make my coleslaw I will definitely be adding extras.  TY for waking up this sleeping cook.  :)

I thought this was pretty good...but I did modify it a bit to give it a little more oomph...I was using broccoli slaw to begin with and I was out of mayo so I had to use miracle whip...I also added 1/2 cup black beans, 3 cloves garlic (we like garlic :), a little extra olive oil, some fresh cracked pepper and about 2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro.  Will make again...it was great with the Turkey/black bean burgers I made!

I expected this to taste more salsa-y but the mayo to salsa ratio seemed off to make it a very tasty slaw. Sorry for the negative review - others seemed to like it. We did not care for it.

If your craving the typical coleslaw this wont cure it at all; im sorry but i didnt like the flavor the olive oil brought to the dish. It might just be the brand that i personally have here at home but it wouldnt be worth testing out again in my opinion.

This was so good! I did change up a few things; I added basil, garlic powder, onion powder, dill, and pineapple salsa (to add sweetness). I also did not measure anything, I just threw it all together until it tasted the way I wanted. I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this variation.  I added about a tsp of chili lime hot sauce to kick it up even a bit further.    Thanks for the recipe!

This is yum!! I used homemade pretty spicy salsa. The salsa will make or break this recipe. Pick your fav salsa and make it a few degrees above what you would normally like the heat ;)~

Delicious and very simple.  I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any on hand, and used fresh cabbage and green onions rather than coleslaw mix.

While I love the idea of adding salsa to coleslaw, I wasn't entirely pleased with my results. I used Newman's Own Tequila Lime salsa, and tasted the dressing as ingredients were added. I thought it tasted better as just mayonnaise and salsa - the addition of the lemon juice made it too tangy. That could have been because of my choice of salsa, though. I also thought the seasoned salt made it too salty. Next time, I would go with a plain salsa, and a few pinches of assorted spices in place of the seasoned salt. Also, I used the entire 16-oz bag of slaw, and had plenty of dressing. With a little tweaking, I could easily suit this recipe to my tastes.

This is fantastic.  I've made it several times, using a different salsa each time (the spicy green tomatillo salsa has been my favorite so far). For a twist, I piled some on top of hot dogs in buns.  It gave them a great bit of heat and crunch.

I was looking for a way to use half of a head of cabbage that had been in my refrigerator, and a recipe without too many ingredients.  I thought that this seemed different and interesting, and I wasn't disappointed!  I added a carrot (nothing that you wouldn't find in a bag of mix) but also a bit of red onion for a little extra kick, since I wanted a little more color and some reviewers had considered the recipe a bit bland.  I used a medium-hot pineapple salsa (Newman's Own) and was pleased with the result.  I'll look forward to trying this again with a fresher cabbage, and serving it with something Tex-Mex...a bean tostada or cheese enchilada casserole would probably be really good, though I did enjoy it tonight with some great brisket!  Plenty of dressing for the amount of vegetables, it almost reminded me of a slightly spicy, not-as-sweet 1000 Island dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

Overall it was a very easy recipe ~ which is what I was looking for! It was on the bland side though. I would definitely add more seasonings the next time around.

This was a fast, easy and tasty side dish to go along with the grilled fish tacos that I made for Cinco de Mayo.  My husband and boys really liked it.

Really good and easy.  My husband loved it and already asked me to make it again!  I want to tailor the ingrediants slightly so that it doesn't have as much liquid leftover after chilling...but that's my complaint about most coleslaw.
