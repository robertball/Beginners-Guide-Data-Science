Good recipe. It can be made healthier with a lot less oil, use olive oil, and less flour. For this kind of frying, don't use your evoo, use a lighter one. Less smoke.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I followed very close to the original recipe, however I used less oil and I used seasoned bread crumbs. I also couldn't find halibut, so we used cod. DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing.  We will make again. Yummm.

This is nothing more than fried fish with onions and balasamic vinigar sprinkled on top.  Nothing too fancy, but this was surprisingly good!  I seasoned the breading, but that's the only change I made.  My four year old daughter gobbled it up!

I used cod and this fish came out better than I expected. I was worried it was going to be soggy, but it was not.

Sorry but I had a couple of problems with this recipe. The flour/breadcrumb mixture wouldn't stick to the fish without a binder.  I whisked a whole egg, dipped the fish into flour, the egg and then into the flour/breadcrumb mixture.  After doing this the fish was really good.  The balsamic for me was too sweet to serve with fish.  I felt and tasted that the dish needed more acidity.  Thanks for posting your recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this way of making halibut. I used seasoned bread crumbs and all purpose flour. The balsamic vinegar adds a good flavor.
