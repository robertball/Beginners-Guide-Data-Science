YUUU-MMY!  I had a slight "inspiration" while making this last night.  Instead of cooking the green and red peppers along with the onions and carrots, I roasted them by slicing in half lengthwise and placing them in the pre-heated broiler for a few minutes on each side until charred.  Then let the pieces cool a few minutes before chopping them up to add into the soup along with the water.  I also eliminated the dry potato flakes and used a large Yukon Gold diced and cooked with the onions and carrots.  And I added just a little extra of each seasoning listed.  This was a knock-out soup and so easy to make!  Thanks Margo!

This was great! I roasted red and yellow peppers, (didn't use green), used 4 carrots, added a can of green chilis, can of cream style corn, subsituted 1 can of fat-free evaporated milk instead of half-and-half to lighten it up. Didn't use the milk at all and felt like it was just the right consistency. Oh, I also forgot to add the cheese on top and didn't miss it. This was great the first day, even better the second.

I LOVE corn chowder, but have never made it.This is one great recipe! 

After reviewing a number of other recipes and reader comments, I made a few changes.
I didn't have any peppers that day, so I substituted a slice celery rib, and I added a 14 oz can of creamed corn after softening the vegetables. 

Instead of 3 c water, used 2 c water, 1 chicken broth + 3/4 cup skim milk powder. And reduced the potato flakes to 1 c.   It was very good.  Will make this again.
 You probably don't need to change anything in the original recipe, but I think that the creamed corn helps and I would use whatever broth you have on hand for part of the water required.

I made this for the entire staff of the hotel I used to work for and everyone loved it. I made it again and froze it individual serving sizes. It is so flavorful.

This was really good. I refuse to eat potato flakes, so I added 3 finely diced yukon gold potatoes and some extra cheese and some flour to thicken it up. I also added some left over grilled chicken.  Delicious!

This was awesome!!! I used canned carrots to speed up the cooking process. I always make large amounts of soup when i cook. I made this recipe to yield 30 servings. I used Paprika instead of Cayenne,only because i had it in the house and Cayenne is VERYexpensive. To all you soup makers:ALWAYS STICK TO THE RECIPE MEASURES! IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.Sometimes a soups consistancy changes as you cook, wait until the finished product,then add whatever you think you have to add. Its dissapointing to "botch" up a batch of soup but thats how you learn. Karl Buffalo NY.

My husband & I really liked the recipe w/ a few changes. Because we thought it should be a bit thicker, I used 2 - 16 oz. bags of frozen corn, & 1/2 c. more pot. flakes. (I used buds, which work just as well. Next time, I will add 1 can of cream of corn soup as well. Otherwise, delicious & easy.

THIS IS EXCELLENT WITH A FEW MODIFICATIONS: COOK 2 DICED POTATOES WITH OTHER VEGGIES, USE CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF WATER, ADD 1 CAN OF CREAM CORN, AND TO ADD MORE KICK TO IT ADD MORE PEPPER. THE NEXT TIME I MAKE THIS I WILL BE ADDING SOME GRILLED CHICKEN TO THIS SOUP!

Not the creamy corn chowder you might be thinking about but reminiscent of the flavors with a lot more veggies. I like to think of it as the healthier alternative.

This soup was outstanding. My family just loved it.  I added some crisp bacon right before serving and also used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of the water.  I will definetly make this recipe again.  Thanks

I absolutely loved this chowder!  The only thing different I did was to add more pepper and extra potato flakes to thicken it more.  I will try the added bacon to it next time as suggested.  This is definitely a comfort food.

Yummy corn chowder, though I have tasted better. Sauted 3 slices of crumbled bacon with the vegetables instead of using butter, used 1/2 tsp of salt & 1/8 tsp cayenne. also used chicken broth in place of water. My 9 year old loves this chowder and is taking leftovers for lunch today :)

I added some celery, and used a can of creamed corn and a can of evaporated milk instead of the milk and half and half.  I also used a couple of potatoes and the bags of corn were 16 ounces and I used two.  I used canola oil to cook the onions and green and red peppers in and used a can of chicken bouillon plus a few cubes of bouillon and water instead of salt.  I did use a lot of ground pepper but no hot pepper, I let each person add their own red pepper flakes or sauce as they preferred.  My children raved about this soup. We added sharp cheddar at the end when re heating the chowder and I have never had so many raves even from my son in law who never eats soup and he said he had it for lunch and then for dinner.

Absolutely fantastic!  Like the little kick of spice.  I add some grilled chicken chunks to it and I have a full meal.  Not the best for freezing, but when I make it, I just have to make so much that I can enjoy it anytime!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  My only changes were to use lower fat evaporated milk instead of half and half and to add a little extra liquid.  I found it a little too thick for my family's liking otherwise.  Rich and flavorful and tastes even better the second day.  A real KEEPER!

Kids thought this was really good and hubby happily took it to work for lunch.  I added celery to the veggies.  I also used two cans of corn.  Added extra water to make a little more. Next time I might sprinkle some crumbled sausage on top with the cheese!  On a side note all I had was potato pearls and I went ahead with it anyway.  There IS a difference and although I made it work I wasn't able to follow liquid recommendations as closely. I knew that would be the case.  Wish I had flakes around my house but I don't!  Oh well.  :)

It's one of those "It's not me, it's the recipe" moments. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used fresh corns. I had to try to do something to salvage the chowder. I will probably not make this again. Sorry for the bad review.

I followed the advice of others and used some creamed corn with a bit of the regular frozen kind and substituted evaporated milk for the half and half and had disappointing results.  I'm not sure which did it, but the soup had a unwanted sort of sweetness to it. If you're thinking of making this I would suggest avoiding the creamed corn and evaporated milk and just stick to the original recipe.

This was the best corn chowder to date.  I didn't have
potato flakes so I used real potatoes.  I also used chicken stock in place of the water, used fresh corn on the cob that I grilled.  I also roasted the red pepper. I thought  it had  a lot of flavor.  My boyfriend thought this was the best corn chowder I have made.  Thanks for the recipe.

An easy tasty recipe.  I was worried about the potato flakes tasting "artificial", but the spicy seasonings hold the flavor together

I made this as a starter for Thanksgiving dinner this year. Everyone loved it. My husband has been begging me to make it again. The only thing I did different was to use canned carrots instead of fresh. It cooked a little faster that way. This is a keeper for us. It was delicious.

Yummy!!  We really liked this soup.  We didn't have any cheese, so we didn't use it, and we replaced the half and half with non fat plain yogurt.  Still tasted great, and without all the calories and fat!

This recipe is a total winner at my house! It has become my husbands favorite. He can't get enough of it.  I've also made it for family and friends and they've all asked for the recipe. The prep time does take a little longer than it says, but it's really easy to throw together! It's also very filling! I like to put more cheese in it than it calls for, it seems to make it thicker. Also, it tastes great the next day, so I always make enough for leftovers!

Great soup, make a nice amount too. Followed recipe except for adding more frozen corn and one can of creamed corn. I did use what Emeril calls his 'boat motor' to mix it a little at the end. I would serve this soup again, family loved it except for youngest son. Great recipe Margo!

This was a very pretty corn chowder.  I added a can of creamed corn to it, as other reviewers suggested. I will definitely make it again, but will probably add diced potatoes and double the red pepper.

The chowder turned out great, but the cooking time far exceeded "25 minutes".  Perhaps the recipe should call for cutting the carrots smaller to save on cooking time.  Overall, the soup was delicious and pretty easy to make.

Quick and easy.  After 3 bowls of it, I was in the bathroom for hours!  Really cleans out the system.  I'd rate it higher if I could.

This soup was pretty good but nothing special.  If I make it again I will use higher quality corn instead of a generic brand to help the flavor.

I learned of this recipe from a friend last year.  My daughter loves making it and it's a family "comfort food" favorite for those cool evenings.  We added a can of crab meat and it's over the top good.

Bit surprised over the ratings.  I just didn't think this was very good.  It had a weird 'hot' sort of after taste that sat on my tongue, and yet it wasn't really hot, and was in fact bland and didn't have much flavor.  But that weird after taste kept me from adding more zing to it.  Won't make again.

I've made this recipe twice and have  adjdusted some ingredients to my taste. I had leftover cooked bacon so I chopped and added that along w 2 small diced/cooked potatoes. I used less water (2 1/2 cups), non-fat half and half and reduced fat shredded cheese. I think I will try it next time w chicken broth as others have suggested. Overall very good and even better the next day!!! Thanks

Hm, I'm not so sure about this one. It was edible, but tasted just as if it was some vegetables served in some warm milk. On top of that, the peppers really didn't seem to fit in with that concept at all. The potato flakes didn't seem to do much for the consistency. I see most people really enjoyed it so maybe this one is just not for us. Will try other corn chowder recipes. Thanks anyway.

This was awesome.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i had to do some tweaking.  I added more water because it was too thick after I added the potato flakes, and I also added a can of creamed corn and a pinch of caynne pepper.  Husband loved it and it made a great meal on a cold day.  Will definately make again.

This was okay but a little lacking in flavor...nothing that can't be adjusted.  I made the recipe as written (why review a recipe if you have changed it into an entirely different one?) and liked all of the vegetables.  Prep time took a while but not too bad.  It did hit the spot on a cool, rainy night but next time I will play with some more seasonings.

I loved this recipe. I did make some changes.  I added chopped potato and chopped celery.  I also used chicken broth. I used salt, pepper and some tobasco chipotle sauce instead of cayene pepper.  When serving, I sprinkled with cheese, bacon pieces and green onions.

I played around with this recipe so I don't know if my rating is accurate for the exact ingredients.  I added salt, pepper, paprika, chile powder, and red chile flakes to taste.  I substituted chicken broth for water.  I also added a can of creamed corn and added chopped potatoes(put in microwave first for 2 min).  It turned out SO yummy.  It was the best 4 days after I made it.

This tasted GREAT! I made it for 2 Filipinas & they loved it ;) I used canned corn (we don't have frozen here), I reduced the amount of carrots, added a little more water & added more of all the spices. I will make this again & again THANKS!

This was very good, I wouldn't say it was awesome but I would probably tweak it a bit to change the recipe to make it tastier. I think real potatoes, instead of potato flakes would make it better.

I liked this recipe very much!  Sounds terrible but I am single and live in a cold area, this served up a nice, thick, hot soup for a couple of days accompanied by a sandwich.  I did take liberty and add some potatoes!  It is a great recipe!  Thanks!

this was one of the best corn chowders i have ever had.  I like it a little thicker than it came out so I added an extra cup of potato flakes and 3 tsp of flour. also added 2 chicken boullion cubes w/the water, 1/2tsp garlic w/vegeies,1 can cream corn,and extra 1/2 cup frozen corn. ommitted the carrots.

All my guests loved this soup.  I used flavored potato flakes (roasted garlic).  I thought it was a little spicy, so I added more veggies, milk and half n' half.  I will make this again.

This soup is so good and looks so pretty with different colored peppers and corn.  I make it for Thanksgiving every year.

My kids LOVED this soup, even the picky eater.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Well, except the cayenne. Next time I'll add paprika.

a tasty soup for sure.  shared with a few others and everyone loved it.  I did use creamed corn for one of the frozen pkgs. of corn, did use chicken broth instead of water and more half and half and no milk.  minor changes but the soup was a hit and even my husband liked it, and he doesn't eat soup! awesome!

Great recipe, quick & easy.  I made the following substitutions -

1 potato for potato flakes *
2 cups almond milk for the milk & half and half. 

At the end I added a little cold water to about 2 tbs of corn starch to thicken.  It turned out great!!!  My 9 year old son even liked it :)

I've always loved corn chowder but had never found the perfect recipe until I came across this one a couple years ago. This chowder is such a delicious and comforting meal during those cold wintery months. Not to mention so easy to prepare! It has definitely become a family favorite!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a can of green chiles and a chopped up russet potato to the first step (I did not want to buy potato flakes).  I used a veggie "chicken" stock in place of the water.  Everyone loved this recipe, though all agreed that it was the cheddar (get the sharpest you can find) that sent it over the top.

Used one can of cream-style corn and a can-full of frozen corn niblets instead of the 2x10oz packages. I also replaced the water with chicken stock, and omitted the cream. A great, quick version of corn chowder.

Tasty soup1 After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments to suit our tastes. Instead of water, I used vegetable broth, cumin instead of cayenne pepper, and I also added more potato flakes after adding the milk and half and half to thicken it more.

This is a very good soup and quite simple.  My kids thought it was bit spicy, but the cayenne was just enough to warm the throat.  I added some leftover smoked sausage for some smokey flavor.  Next time I may replace the cayenne with cumin.

This recipe was just "OK" for me.  There was too much pepper for us, and it really wasn't that flavorful.  If I were to make it again, I'd use less pepper and substitute the water with chicken broth.

We really liked this and will make again. I used skim milk and 1 cup half and half to cut the calories and it was great. I think that I will use a bit more cayenne next time for more pep. I wouldn't change another thing. Thanks so much.

This corn chowder is excellent!  I have tried corn chowders before and was disappointed, until now. However, since we like our soups thicker, I added more potato flakes and next time would add less liquid, either milk or half and half. It makes a large amount and is very rich and creamy. I also added more cheese than the recipe calls for. Try it- you will love it.

I used a Poblano pepper, rather than the green bell, and roasted it with the red bell pepper. Since I wanted it savory, rather than sweet, I skipped the carrots.  Used diced potato like some reviewers.  To help thicken it, I used 5T of masa harina (since it's corn flour), which I mixed with water before adding.  I also used some  chipotle and ancho pepper (the kind you can shake on).

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used evaporated milk instead of half and half with fine results.  I personally thought it had too much "kick" with the Cayenne pepper and in the future will half the amount called for.

I made this for a friend after he had sugury so I only got to sample it. I 1/2 the recipe, used fresh potatoes, and added some cooked bacon. His 6 year old gave it thumbs up!

Made it for us, freezes great,actually tasted better, reheated.

i made this last night - i tweaked it a bit, i added fresh parsley and more seasoning as it seemed a bit bland - i didn't add milk or cream as it didn't need it because of the potato flakes, it was delicious and my kids loved it - served with fresh homemade ciabbata bread (recipe also on this site)

Maybe some substitute for the potato flakes? It seemed grainy.  As with everything though it was much better on day two and three.

I thought this was pretty terrible.  It had no flavor at all.  I tried to doctor it up with a bunch of spices, but I couldn't find any way to make it tasty.  It is a very simple recipe, and thats what it tasted like.  I guess you can't expect to make something this easy and have it taste wonderful.  My friend liked it more than I did, but she still didn't think it was too great.

This chowder was fabulous.  I have never had corn chowder before, but this recipe sounded very interesting and I was SO glad I tried it.  My husband raved also.  I did spend the extra money on the Cayenne Pepper and was very glad that I did, it added that extra kick!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This soup is a keeper! I increased it to 16 servings and it worked for my soup group. Everyone loved it! Very tasty - quick to put together. Thanks again for a great recipe.

If you like thicker chowders, you may want to add more potato flakes.  Otherwise, its a great recipe!

This recipe was quick and easy. Very filling so you don't need much. Loved the cheese melted on top. My kids rated it thumbs up.
