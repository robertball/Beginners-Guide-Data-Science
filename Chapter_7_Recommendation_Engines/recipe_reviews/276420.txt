This is a very good Gnocchi dish, we really liked it.
I used mild Italian Sausage and San Marzano tomatoes.
The San Marzano tomatoes donâ€™t have water in them so I was a bit short on liquid. I added some water to the can to scrape out the can and it worked great.
The flavours are wonderful, all in all delicious.
Thank you for another great recipe and another  way to make 
Gnocchi.

Super easy to make and very easy clean up. Even better, it was an absolute hit with my husband. I think he had three servings. We both had it for lunch today - as with many dishes like this, it was even better the next day. Highly recommend!
