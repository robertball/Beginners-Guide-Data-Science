I am torn with this one...the rice itself was pretty basic (I used spicy tomatoes from the can and that helped considerably) and I found the salsa to be pretty darn good...but the two mixed together really weren't spectacular.  I ended up using the salsa with some chips and will be eating the rice either wrapped up in a tortilla with other ingredients or adding something to liven it up.  Thank you for the recipe, because again, I thought the salsa was pret-ty good!

This recipe was very easy to make but didn't have all that much flavor.  The peppers on top didn't really add anything to your typical Spanish rice recipe.  I have a lot of leftovers so I'll be eating it again but I won't be cooking it again.

Excellent meal, could add some chorizo sausage/shrimp and call it paella!  If too spicy would take out some of the chili powder.
