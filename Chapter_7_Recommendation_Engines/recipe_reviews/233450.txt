The idea of these three vegetables was appealing; however, as it turned out I did not enjoy the dish.  I was neither a fan of the coriander nor the lemon juice.  Especially the lemon juice.  And given this is a sauté, where was the fat?  I used olive oil.  Other than maybe some minced garlic, I should have left it at that.

We really enjoyed this dish!  It was a great combination of vegetables and the lemon juice gave it a bright flavor.  The coriander was a nice touch and everyone loved it.  The only thing I did differently was to use fresh parsley instead of dried.

This is a great recipe to make when your garden is overflowing with green beans, squash and cherry tomatoes! I used fresh parsley as that was also prolific in our garden. I used have a little EVOO & butter to cook the veggies in and waited until the very last minute to add the parsley and tomatoes so it stayed fresh. Everyone loved it!

Just so happens I was given yellow squash, green beans and cherry tomatoes from a relative's garden. Couldn't believe it when I found this recipe using those exact veggies :)  I regularly use lemon juice on veggies, and I love coriander but have never used it on veggies that I recall. Turns out I loved it.  That along with the lemon juice complemented the produce very well.  I'll be trying coriander on other veggies in the future.

I feel there could of been adjustment.  My husband was not a fan. I think the slices should not be thin slices. Thin slices made it more mushy then firm. He really did not care for the lemon juice and neither did I.  Will be making some adjustments to the recipe.

i found the dish to be pretty bland.. i did have to make some substitutions but i don't think it really effected the intended flavor.. mexican squash for yellow squash and chopped up tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes.. i probably at least tripled the salt but it does state "or to taste".. i felt like something was missing.. so i sprinkled some garlic powder and onion powder over this.. maybe some parm would help.. i was just hoping for something more

I didn't have any coriander on hand and I used fresh parsley instead of dried. I did start with a table spoon of olive oil too (I use olive oil for everything though). I also had to cook veggies longer than directions said but I like my green beans a little mushier. It was so good and healthy! Will make this again and like another person said, great recipe for garden overflow next summer! A keeper!

Not sure where it went wrong but the lemon made it inedible. Maybe the lemon was off

I used fresh ingredients. Using fresh green beans they didn’t cook as quickly as the squash so I would start them first next time.  Recipe was quick, healthy and complemented the tropical pork chops perfectly. I will definitely make this again

Really good but a little heavy on the lemon juice. I will cut back on it the next time I make this dish.

Very good dish! I sauté the green beans and squash in 1 Tablespoon of butter and 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. I omitted the lemon juice. Came out perfect. Thank you.

This was Great! I omitted the lemon juice, sauteed with 1 tablespoon olive oil & 1 tablespoon butter, used fresh green beans and kept everything else the same.  I also covered it for a few minutes to steam (We like our vegetables a bit softer). I wasn't sure about the coriander,  but it added a nice subtle taste. Will definitely make again!

I used Zima grape tomatoes instead of cherry and it came out great. Went really well with tilapia.
