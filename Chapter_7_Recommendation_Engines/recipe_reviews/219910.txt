I'm giving this five stars just for the gelatin idea alone. Fabulous! However, I did make minor changes.  These were interesting to make. For our taste, we thought the cake was a bit too sweet as written, so I made it again using just the yellow cake mix and 1 tb. meringue powder. Worked great.  I quickly rolled them in the gelatin mixture (not to overly absorb.) The outer edge seems a bit soft at first but firms-up nicely after gelatin sets. I froze them in a square cake carrier with some plastic wrap lightly covering them for added protection and put on the lid too. I can take-out however many I need to defrost at room-temp. about 15 minutes. Makes for an unexpected treat for company. Everyone I've served them to, thought they were extremely tasty. For a faster fix can pump-in whipped topping for the filling, (if desired.) Won't be as flavorful but very good still and lite. Thank-you for the recipe.

I made these for dessert yesterday and hubby is still raving this morning! Seven people ate these and all seven absolutely loved them. Many comments... "the best"... "much, much better than store bought"..."so good...moist, not too sweet and great flavor", etc... I agree with every compliment. They are perfect! Followed the recipe except used a canoe  pan and didn't chop the coconut in the processor. Excellent recipe with great instructions. I'm looking forward to making these often. Thanks for sharing, Caroline!

Tastes great!  I used chocolate cake and chocolate pudding (that's all I had) but they made it so good.  VERY time consuming it took me at least 1 hour to make the boat like fixtures.  I filled each half way but still had 4 tin foil boat things.  Very delicious especially with cream on top.
YUMMMMMMYYY!

I made this tonight ! OMG Excellent !!!! I did 2 round pans and cut each layer in half. Put Jello on crumb side and frosted the other with the cream filling, as I assembled the cake. Then just sprinkle coconut on the frosted parts, making sure to save some for the top of cake. This recipe is well worth the effort !!!  Thank You for sharing.  P.S.Instead of the jello you can use raspberry (seedless) jelly Add small amt. of water to thin it out and paint it on with a pastry brush. Muffin pan is much quicker if in a hurry....

Freak'n awesome!  I did use my own filling recipe, so can't rate that;  used 1/2 cup veg oil as the only pudding I had was a 1oz pkg, but they turned out superb.  I used a bar pan with about 1/4 cup mix per mold - mine took around 20 minutes to cook.

I only use 1 cup of boiling water with the raspberry jello.  I put it in a spray bottle while warm and spray it on.  Easier for me than dipping.

You can buy a pan to make the Twinkies from Amazon. Just a FYI.

I am not a Twinkie fan, but I made these for my wife and kids for Valentines Day.  I made 8 of the boats and used 8 mini cake molds. I used a 1/4 cup to scoop the batter into the molds to keep everything even. I then used an apple corer to hollow out the center to inject the filling. They all thought they were good, so I consider that a success. It did take a while to make this, and I didn't use the raspberry jello or coconut. The cakes are spongy and have the same consistency as the real deal. Thanks for good recipe!

This is a really good recipe, however, mine came out tasting like a cake and icing in the shape of Twinkies. I was a great treat and fun to make. Will definitely make more and may play with a chocolate version like another review mentioned.

Zingers are one of my mom's favorite snack cakes so I wanted to give this a try to surprise her.   I opted to make this into a cake instread of individual snack versions. 

The recipe was easy to follow but I would say that I dipped my cake a bit longer to get that raspberry flavor more prominent. Doing that I recommend doubling the coconut.  

This was an absolute sucesss.  Will I modify it in the future?  Yes!  I envision changing making it pineapple jello soaked with the coconut in the summer.
