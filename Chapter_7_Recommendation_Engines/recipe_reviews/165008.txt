I tried this recipe on a whim and was able to make some adjustments that made it a fantastic dish for the whole family.  In the cream sauce I didn't use the chipotle chilies instead I added 2 T fresh snipped cilantro, 1/2 t cumin, 1/4 t onion salt & 1 T lime juice.  Next time I will add green chilies.  For the fish I used 3 T olive oil, 2 t cumin, a dash of cinnamon, 1/2 t onion salt, 2 T minced garlic, 2 T dehydrated onion and a bunch of snipped fresh cilantro.  I let it saute about 5 minutes and added 4 T lime juice and 5 tilapia fillets.  I warmed the soft taco sized flour tortillas in a skillet added fish, the garlic/cilatro mix, put a small amount of cream sauce on the tortilla and topped with finely shredded green cabbage.  My 10 year old & my husband loved it!  It was fast, easy & flavorful.  I will double the recipe next time!

This was the BEST fish taco I have ever had! My family really enjoyed it. Tilapia is so clean-tasting and with the spices, it became very flavorful. One change was adding an extra chile to the sour cream mixture. It made it spicier and more delicious. Definitely a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious, my whole family loved these tacos.  However I did leave the chipotle cream off the kids tacos.  But the cream was perfect for my husband and I and we smothered our tacos.  The only thing I did different was instead of putting greens in the tacos I topped them with bagged coleslaw mix.  And I used a little more oil and garlic than called for.  What I really liked is that I threw this dinner together in a matter of minutes.

These were simple to make but not worth the effort! They were so spicy that we could not even eat them. If I made them again, I would eliminate the adobo sauce (I think that is what made them so spicy) and replace with another type of sauce.

Very good! I cut the tilapia in chunks after cooking it and used shredded cabbage instead of the mixed greens. I also added a little chili powder. Great flavors. Thanks! :)

I really loved this recipe for the fish, it's really tasty and a great start for a fish taco. I keep the fish just the way it is in the recipe, but I like it  better with corn tortillas, shredded cabbage, and fresh pico de gallo (diced tomatoes, diced yellow onion, fresh minced jalepeno, and fresh cilantro)-- I like the chipotle cream but I have used softened cream cheese (1 whole package)instead of sour cream, I really like it that way, I think I will also try to make the chipotle cream with mayo, which may sound strange but mayo sauces seem to usually go good with fish tacos. Just be careful with how much of the chipotle pepper and adobo that you put into it (start with a little and add more to your taste) This is a a great recipe, but but not for those who have sissy tongues that can't handle spice!

This is so good!  I made it as a fish entree, served it with black beans and rice and used the chipotle cream sauce as a dipping sauce.  At first I was hesitant about adding cinnamon to a fish recipe, but it works well with the lime and the smoky flavor of the chipotles.

If you like to eat healthy, and like a little spice - these are the best fish tacos I've ever had.  I make these every 2 weeks, as I am now addicted.  I make it with low or no fat sour cream and the whole wheat tortillas from the bakery.  Even if I don't have fresh cilantro, I used dried - I don't care - I must eat these at least a couple times a month.

My sister made these tacos and they were sooo good. She used mayonnaise instead of sour cream, and she didn't add any salt. They were a little spicy, but that was easily fixed by reducing the amount of adobo sauce.

Made these like the recipe said, except I flipped the fish prior to adding the lime juice so the color would be on both sides of the fish.  They are awesome, I've already made them twice and am adding them to my personal recipe collection.  I used cabbage as I was out of lettuce.  Really good!

Interesting recipe. If you don't like cinnamon, leave it out because it packs a powerful punch.  The chipotle sauce was so good I could've eaten it with a spoon. :)

Admittedly, my husband and I don't like things quite as spicy as this recipe is, we really liked it.  Next time I will cut down to 1 chipotle pepper for the sauce, and that will be just right for us.  Also, I think next time I will combine all the spices together and dust the fish with it before frying.  Maybe that will give it a more even coatng.

This is one of the best ways I have found to cook tilapia. These tacos are so flavorful that you want to keep eating them even when you are full!  We have these every other week now because they are so good! The only adjustment I make is to use alot more cilantro than what is called for, but that is personal preference.

Delicious!  This is one of my new favorite recipes!   Folllowed the recipe almost exactly, except I mixed the chipotle cream sauce in my food processor, as that was much easier than having to mince and mix myself.  Also, my fish took a little longer to cook, and I had to turn it over to help in the process.  I used the regular iceberg lettuce I had for the greens, then used some diced tomatoes and shredded cheese for the tacos as well. YUMM!

I made this recipe for my mother and she liked it. Me, on the other hand, not so much. The spices that I sauted were really wonderful, but the lime juice made it seem overly fishy. It was much better when I put it with hot sauce and guacamole.

I was hoping that this recipe would be a family favorite, but it wasn't.  I liked them enough, but the tacos were missing something...I'm not sure what, though. I will make them again, but I'm gonna do a little tweaking to the recipe.   LOVED the chipotle peppers :)  I had never used those before and will use them again!

I can't vouch for the sauce recipe (hence the four stars -- we used aioli) but the fish was remarkable.

This was fantastic!  I wasn't expecting it to be so tasty, nor did I expect the combination of spices to turn out so great!  Loved the chipotle sour cream dip - make sure you only use two out of the whole can!  Used pre-made cabbage instead of greens and had black beans and rice on the side.  Husband loved it, will definitely make again!

This was a fun recipe! I didn't tell hubby what I was making, so when I brought them out, he said "what is this?" And I said "fish tacos" And he goes "Hmm, that sounds strange, I don't know about this." But he tried it and ended up eating 3! I made the fish as written but used a simple mayo/dijon mustard blend for the sauce, since we can't have anything too spicy. Also added a little grated parmesan cheese (we love cheese). The cilantro really made the fish taste great, and the lettuce greens provided a nice crunch. We'll definitely have this again!

Unfortunately this meal was not really liked by my family - it was below average.  I think the problem stemmed from steps 2 and 3 of the recipe - when I sauted the spices in the oil they just got too dark and scorched despite the fact I turned down the heat and only cooked it for a couple minutes instead of the full five.  If this step was included to cook the garlic it wasn't really necessary because the garlic can cook while the fish does.  It might have helped to have more liquid with the spices, but the lime juice wasn't added until step three.  If I was to make this recipe again I would either add the lime juice to the spices so they didn't scorch or I would skip step 2 and throw everything in the pan to cook at once.  I like fish tacos so I will either try this recipe again with changes, or look for a different recipe.

Loved this!!!  I only sauted for about 3 min over med heat & used cole slaw mix instead of greens.  I think next time I'll add the cole slaw mix in with the fish to let it steam a little.  Like the cinnamon, but might cut back a tad next time.

Great recipe - especially when you have to fudge some of the ingredients. Only had the opportunity to buy canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce whole and with seeds. VERY SPICY but I was able to cut down the spice a little with extra sour cream. Regardless, the meal is delicious. I threw it together and had most of the ingredients on hand. Seriously a flexible and forgiving dish!

To those who say this dish is too spicy: Don't use two CANS of chilis.  Use two CHILIS!

My husband is very conservative with his praise for food, and he loved it.  My modifications:

Three chilis instead of two.

Do NOT cook the spices on "medium high for five minutes".  Your kitchen will fill with smoke and the spices will burn.  Try "medium low".

The whole tilapia loin didn't get enough spice coating, so I would cut it into big chunks for more surface area, and possibly double the spices/garlic/cilantro too.

Awesome! So full of flavor and spice. I did not change a thing about this recipe. Try it. You'll LOVE it!!   Warning: If you are sensitive to spicy foods, you may want to find a milder recipe. We love hot peppers so this was just what we were looking for.

My family loves fish tacos so I was eager to try this.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I thought this was not very good at all.  The fish was mushy and the chipotle cream sauce overly spicy.  Based upon past experience with chipotle peppers in adobe sauce, I knew to use less than one can.  But, it was still WAY too spicy for us.  The dish was edible, but not something I'd make again. I read and re-read the recipe 4x to make sure I was following the directions properly.

I thought it was wonderful, but I prefer my food VERY SPICY, so I made some additions to the cream sauce.  I added 4 chipotle chilies, 1/2 of a red jalepeno chili, about 1 tsp of red chili flakes, a pinch of garlic powder, and a pinch of black pepper.  Now it really has bite.  I also added more fresh cilantro leaves to the tacos themselves.  Excellent.

I love this recipe but I have never made it with tilapia! I always use the small (50-60 count) shrimp. So delicious and so easy. I guess I'll have to try it with the tilapia someday...

Easy to make. Bland. Not spicy at all. If I make again, next time I will double the spices and maybe triple the amount of chiles.

Really good and really easy.  Some reviews said it was too hot, but as long as you remove the seeds and use two of the canned chilies (not two cans chilies), its really not that spicy.  The flavors used on the fish work really well together.  I wouldn't change a thing! Others mentioned that 5 minutes was too long to simmer the first 7 ingredients, but mine turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

These were super easy to make and my family loved them! We will definitely keep this on the menu. The only change we made was instead of the two canned chipotle chili's we used the can! We love it hot! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was really bland, although it looked nice.  It was the type of thing that REALLY needed the sauce in order to taste of anything.

These were amazing! I made these one night when I was just making dinner for myself and I had one tilapia filet left. It was super quick, super easy, and so delicious. All I have to say is I've never been so sad to have run out of tilapia!

My husband did like this but the sauce was way too spicy.  I didn't care for the sauce at all.  The fish was ok and would probably be good in tacos with regular sour cream on top.  Thanks for the new experience anyway.

My review is for the fish with the spices as we could not find the chiles in adobo to make the cream sauce. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly--Very tasty tilapia with the spices. We really enjoyed this and will make it again. We garnished with a bit of Monterey Jack cheese, fat free plain yogurt in place of sour cream, and a few jalapenos for me. :) I look forward to trying the cream sauce.

LOVED this recipe!  I used corn tortillas and they were wonderful!  We love spicy food, so I would add in a couple more chiles or maybe some of the adobo sauce.

This fish tastes GREAT - perfect for mild, but flavorful fish tacos, and it was SUPER EASY to prepare! I was hesitant to add the cinnamon, so I only added 1/8 teaspoon, and I think it was plenty (but also a nice addition, so I wouldn't skip it). The recipe did not say to cup up the tilapia, but I did slice them in half lengthwise, which made them a better shape for the tacos. The different brands of canned chipotle peppers have varying strength, so I recommend starting with 1 chipotle pepper, and adding more if you want more heat (we ended up using 3 peppers). I blended the chipotle cream ingredients quickly with an immersion blender since I didn't want any large bits of chipotle in the sauce - it's an extra step, but easy and worth it in hte end, I think. The cream sauce really complements the flavor of the fish, so I definitely recommend making it. Finally, for something a bit more authentic I used warmed corn tortillas and shredded cabbage to go on the tacos instead of the flour tortillas and mixed greens called for in the recipe. I served with sides of rice and black beans, and it was a great, easy meal. Will definitely make again, thanks!

My husband cooked this for us for dinner.  This was the first meal that he has prepared for us in over 8 years!!! It came out great.  The flavors go together perfectly.  One taco was plenty for each of us.  My 9 year old asked if we could have this for dinner every night!

Made this for my family. Everyone loved it. I used sliced cabbage rather than lettuce though. You may want to start with half the peppers then add in--my dad thought everything was too spicy.  Only thing I didn't like was the chipotle cream sauce.  Either use a sour cream with a little fat it in or add a little lime juice.  Mine had the texture and consistency of coconut Jell-O.

All I can say is READ THE AMOUNTS CAREFULLY!  I just made this and instead of 2 peppers I used 2 CANS of chipotle chilis.  I am sure this recipe is good.  Maybe after my lips quit burning I will attempt this again :)

Very good.  I did add extra garlic and found that I had to cook the fish a few more minutes, but overall very good.  The chipotle sauce was great!

Medium high is waaaayyy too high on my stove to cook this. I hardly had the burner turned up to medium and the cilantro/garlic/spice mixture was burnt to a crisp. :( I added new oil to the pan after I chucked the burnt stuff, added the fish and seasoned with adobo seasoning. Fish was yummy. I served with purple cabbage, jalapeno cheddar tortillas, 1/2 spinach/1/2 spring salad mix and the results were yummy. I also blended the sour cream and peppers in the blender to make a creamy sauce. Hubby ate 2 huge helpings. All in all a great recipe...just watch the heat!

I've made this recipe twice. This recipe was simple to make and very good. Which I found great for me not growing up on seafood, and never cooking anything not out of a box. I used cabbage the second time around also corn tortillas were nice. Ill be making this again along with exploring more fish & seafood recipes thanks for this one its awsome!

This recipe was very good. I substituted the cilantro to spinach leaves. And I bought 1 can of Chipotle chiles and used 4 of them. The tacos was mild and very tasty. My kids loved them.

I made this by the recipe and we LOVED it!  I almost didn't add the cinnamon, but went ahead -- it added a nice unique flavor!  We will definitely do this one again!

All I could taste on the fish for the most part was the cinnamon and I even cut it in half as others had suggested. So glad I did but it was still to much and overall blah to me. The cream sauce was all heat with no flavor. I did not take the seeds out of the chiles- I guess I thought since they were canned they wouldn not be as potent but they were!!!
So over all it was blah fish with to hot of sauce for us.

My son and I loved this recipe. I thought that the Chipotle cream sauce was going to be a little too spicy for him. I was wrong the sour cream did a wonderful job of cooling it down. Excellent recipe! Quick and easy also.

This recipe is awesome!  A couple of modifications.  My grocery story didn't have chipotle peppers so I used green chilis, threw in a dash of jalapeno for heat, and then added smoked paprika for the right color and that smokey chipotle taste.  Also used half fat sour cream instead of fat-free, because I hate that aftertaste fat-free seems to have.  Had some langostino's in the freezer so added those to the tilapia.  Nice texture.  Then, on the tacos I added a little fresh, homemade guacamole.  The end result was unbelievably good!  Will have to try it with the cabbage slaw that other reviewers recommend, that seems to have gone over well!  This is a great recipe with lots of room to experiment, but the basic foundation is amazing!

I don't actually know what fish tacos are supposed to taste like, so take this review for what it's worth!  I made it exactly per the recipe the first time, and it was good.  The Chipotle sauce is awesome.  The second time I made it with chicken instead of fish, and I left out the cinnamon.  We will stick with the chicken / no cinnamon version in the future.

I could not believe how amazing these tacos tasted!  My husband and I completely devoured them.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, with just the addition of some chopped red onion and roma tomatoes which I sauteed with the seasoning before adding the tilapia.  I thought the chipotle cream sauce was perfect for this dish.  I will definitely be making these tacos again, and often!

I added one more chili and some adobe sauce to the sour cream mixture.  It was delicious.  The tacos were good, but probably won't make them again.

I've never reviewed ANYTHING before, but I felt extremely compelled to review this recipe.  I followed the recipe word-for-word and the only thing I could taste on the fish was the cinnamon. 2 chilies for a whole cup of sour cream?  Not even close to being enough!  It didn't even change the color or flavor of the sour cream!

Well, it wasn't un-edible, but I was surprised so many people gave this such a high rating! My spouse and I like spicy foods, but we could only handle 1/2 can of the chipotle/adobo in the cream sauce. And the tacos didn't taste good without it, so we couldn't skimp on it either! The spices combo tasted a bit off, if there was a next time we would try it without the cinnamon.  Overall, it was edible, but not worth the effort it took in making it, we have marked this one as a "do not repeat."

Edited 4/27/16: I also started making this with Shrimp - One pound large, fresh and I cut each into 2-3 pieces.  First 5 ingredients as indicated add shrimp and stir it around.  Also steam asparagus and use them in the tacos.
It was delicious!  I've never used chipotle chiles before and it's lucky my family likes things HOT because I used 4 chilies instead of 2!  My only problem was -- If you cook the seven ingredients for 5 minutes, how do you keep everything from becoming a blackened mess of cilantro and garlic like mine was??  Lower temp? take them out of the pan?  It was still good but I need to work on that part...
ETA:  I've made this quite a few times (once a week?) since my first review.  WE LOVE IT.  I use wild caught Cod instead of Tilapia, halved the sauce ingredients and very carefully watch the ingredients cooking, take them out after 3 or 4 minutes and then spoon them on top of the fish as it's cooking.  Much better.....

Interesting recipe! My boyfriend and I both thought it was pretty good. I'm not sure if I'll make it again, but I followed it to a T and it turned out fine. The chipotle sauce gave a it flavor and quite a kick. The lime juice also added great flavor. Overall, not bad!

Made exactly as directed.  Bland bland bland...the fish just tasted like lime juice.  Would double the spices next time if I try this again.

Loved this SO MUCH.  Made the following changes/additions:   1) used Mahi instead of Tilapia and cube it -- big cubes but cube it  2) increased the cilantro to at least 1/2 of a full bunch  3) used only the adobo sauce from the canned chipotle -- unless you like it really hot  4) used blue corn taco shells in addition to the soft shells -- one of each  5) use fresh lime juice on the tacos -- just squeeze a bunch right on there!  Holy cats was that EZ and good!

Everything but the fish was fantastic!  The fish just tasted kind of blah.  It would have been SO much better grilled or seasoned differently.  The cilantro sauce was AMAZING though and I'll be using that all the time!

I have made these tacos several times now, and I love them! I only use one chile in my sour cream because I am not a fan of very spicy things, and I think it is plenty. Our local Kroger makes their own tortillas and with these tacos they are fabulous. Soft and delicious!

Amazing, amazing, amazing! I just changed a few minor things. 1) Added cilantro with the fish (instead of with the spices), 2) used mayo instead of sour cream and only used one chipotle pepper, 3) added chopped romaine, avocado, and fresh pico de gallo. What a simple, fast, delicious, and healthy meal.

All I can say is, Yum!  These are awesome! I changed 2 things:  Non-fat Greek yogurt in place of the fat free sour cream, and used thin corn tortillas instead of flour - delish.  If you are a fish taco fan and like little "spice", you'll like/love this dish.  Easy, yummy, healthy - can't beat it.

An incredible combination of flavors!  You can eliminate the cilantro and chipotle without sacrificing flavor.  Because we had no chipotle peppers, I added approximately two additional tablespoons of olive oil while cooking, and then sour cream to the remnants to make a sauce.  Even our five year old loved it!

This was so easy and so good.  I used regular taco shells, not soft.... and I didn't have any cilantro.  My husband and I finished the whole thing, but I think it would have been too spicy for the kids anyway.  The cinnamon was a nice touch!

This was a quick and easy meal if you have a short notice or limited amount of time. For me and my family we got a two cans and only used 4 or 5. This sauce will be good for you if you like spice, but if you don't you can only add a little of the chiles( whether their canned or not) and the sauce should be good. With the mixed greens they mean like the mixed bags of veggies that you would use for salads. I used lettuce and it was fine. I will definitely make this meal again for my family. Loved it!

Great fish taco. I will cut the sauce down to half next time. We didn't need that much. Could also add tomatoes and avocado if you wanted.

LOVED the sauce but be careful and note the recipe calls for "chilis" not "cans of chilis"...I see where others made that mistake - I almost did! Overall good dish - I added a little more olive oil and cooked it on a lower heat. Not the most amazing fish tacos I've ever had but will consider making it again - the sauce is what makes it!

WOW!  We have been stuck in a taco rut for so long...and I thought I didn't like tilapia!  We have made different variations of this 8 times in the last 6 weeks.  It's the combination of fish/cabbage/sauce that makes this so great!!!

A family favorite for SURE!!  The sauted cilantro mixture is SOOO tasty and everything is JUST RIGHT.  This is probably the most satisfying way I've ever had tilapia.

These are amazing!!!!  The only change that I made was using a bagged coleslaw mix instead of the greens.  I love the crunch of cabbage with fish tacos.  You can't beat these!

We are big taco fans in my house but I got tired of the same old ground beef or turkey tacos so I tried this out.  It was a huge hit.  My 5 year old son loved it, even though he didn't like the sound of "fish tacos"!  I went with guacamole instead of the chipotle cream sauce and I spiced up the talapia with cumin, chipotle powder, lime juice, salt & pepper before adding it to the pan.  It had a nice kick and a wonderful flavor!

This was great.  I didn't make the sauce but I made Red Robin's Campfire sauce to go along with it.  We heated both wheat flour tortillas and corn tortillas on a gridle (spray them w/Pam).  Also, used slaw instead of greens.  Excellent quick dinner.

LOVED these! I did not have any greens, but suspect some shredded cabbage would really add a nice dimension to the dish. I had them both hot off the stove and served cold the next day and loved them both ways!!  The cream sauce has a delicious smoky bite to it, but it was a tad too warm for my non-spice loving hubby.

Definitely the best fish tacos ever! Easy and not to spicy as long as you don't confuse jalapenos with chiles. I used plain chopped chiles and added the chipotle and adobo seasoning.

Loved it!  Added my own pico with tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, jalepeno, and lemon juice as an additional topping.  I have also added guacamole as a topping.  The chipolte sc goes so well with the fish.  Amazing recipe!!

These were very good.  I made fish tacos with them.  The cream sauce really makes this dish.  Very spicy!  My son said that it tastes so good but it is sooo spicy! (He drank 3 glasses of milk with his dinner)  :)

SO DELICIOUS!! I have never cooked fish before & thought I'd screw it up in the skillet..but it turned out perfect! Moist and enough seasoning. Instead of mixed greens we used cabbage, definitely will make again! :)

This was soooo good. I was the only one that wanted to eat these, so I just used two fillets out of the frozen package. I used 6 of the chipotle peppers mixed in the sour cream, the cream or sauce was sooo good and spicy. I will make again for a quick lunch or dinner for myself!! Thanks so much.....

This was an amazing recipe as is but I did use jalapenos and onions diced for the fish mixture.  I really like the spicy chipotle peppers cream sauce.  If you don't like that much spiciness then I would suggest using something else mixed in the sour cream such as a spice mixture and/or fresh cilantro.  Give the sour cream a little pizazz

Really liked this. Simple and ultra tasty, at least until I lost my taste buds because I went a little heavy on the chipotle. Perfect quick meal.

Beware that two peppers make the sauce plenty hot.  Also, you could probably make half the amount of sauce.

My picky DH and I both loved the flavor of the fish--very flavorful and a bit spicy.  I especially liked that I didn't have to marinate the fish, so I don't have to plan ahead to make them.  To make them more authentic, we used white corn tortillas and shredded cabbage.  We also topped them with queso fresco and chopped tomatoes.  Yum!  I will definitely make these again.

My husband and I were surprised how good these were!  We did as another reviewer suggested and cut the fish into strips and breaded them with italian breadcrumbs and added lemon pepper to them.  Great recipe!

I didn't use the chipotle cream sauce for these, so my five stars go entirely to the tilapia. SO good! i didn't alter a thing and the fish turned out so tender and flavorful! I used corn tortillas instead of flour and I used the white sauce from "Fish Tacos" from this site to top. Delicious and healthy!

These are fantastic!!!  I did not follow "make sure to de-seed the peppers" part and they ended up super hot, so make sure to follow that direction!!  Outside of my mistake these were easy to make and delicious.  My family loves spicy so I will use the correct amount of chipotle, just w/out seeds next time! The one request of my family was to cut the fish in strips instead of one piece of fish, I'll try that next time. Can't wait to make again!

First off I have to say that the cream sauce for these was outstanding!  I used 3 peppers instead of 2 and it gave it just the right amount of heat and spice.  The spices on the fish were very good, however, I think next time i'll cut down on the amount of lime juice.  To me it had a over-powering taste.

This was delicious!  It didn't taste the way I originally thought it would (I was thinking of fish tacos I've bought at restaurants, etc.) but it's a very delicious mix of flavors.  I couldn't find the low carb wraps and I'm regretting using regular ones because I can't stop eating them! Word of advice, don't start heating the pan until you have all the ingredients ready to put in, otherwise you'll end up with a burnt mess of spices.  I had to throw out my first attempt at sauteing the seasonings.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! Even if you only make the fish, sans the sauce and the tortillas, they are fabulous!  Easy to make, very flavorful, and always an empty skillet! YUM!!

Sooo good and very quick to prepare. In fact the sauce was so good we are making it again for our chicken wraps!

This was a really great combination of flavors!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but instead of making them into tacos, I cooked the fish as instructed, then topped the fillets with some of the wonderful sour cream sauce (perfectly spicy!), and served with veggies on the side.  My semi-picky boyfriend LOVED them, and even went back for seconds!  Thanks!

I'm giving this a 4 because it seems unfair to rate it lower since I didn't follow the recipe.  I used mahi mahi instead of tilapia, cayenne instead of cinnamon and corn tortillas instead of the low-carb ones and I topped them with some shredded cabbage, a simple homemade pico de gallo and a squeeze of lime.  The tacos themselves were delicious! I plan to make them a lot.  What I did make exactly like the recipe was the chipotle cream and I didn't care for it.  I liked the spiciness but I didn't care for the smokey flavor of the chipotles.  Even a small amount overwhelmed the fish.

This tasted fine, but the fish didn't seem to pick up much flavor. I much prefer a fish taco that I can mariante the fish in the seasonings for a while. I might try that with this recipe

The combination of spices makes for excellent flavor AND made my house smell good! I couldn't find the Chipotle Chile so I added several drops of hot sauce which gave the cream a nice spice. My 3 year old loved it too. This one's a keeper.

This recipe was very easy and ended up OK, but the spices didn't work for us. We'll need to play with the flavors. The cooking process went well. The chipotle sauce is VERY (too) spicy -- and we like spicy!  But, to be honest, we're not big fans of the smokey flavor.

This recipe was really good.  I did slice up the talapia and bread it with garlic bread crumbs and lemon pepper seasoning, for some more flavor.
