I did not like this recipe, I thought it was too sweet, but some other people in my family loved it.  If you like a real sweet, caramel flavor, then you'll like this.

If I could give this recipe no stars, I would.  I did not care for this recipe.  this was way too sweet, an awful consistency! I went against my better judgment and decided to make it even after reading the reviews.  Don't do it!

I was looking for something that was easy and didn't seem to sweet.  This was excellant on chocolate cake.

THE WORST FROSTING EVER.  To grainy, to sweet and almost NO Chocolate flavor.  Does not spread well.  I do not recommend this recipe to any one.   Going back to my butter and cream cheese recipe.

This recipe was relatively easy to make. But you will need a candy thermometer. It was actually tasty but really much to sweet for my liking. Like candy. The kids will love it though.

First of all, after I was done on the stove, I removed from heat and added vanilla. I don't know what happened but the vanilla created like a mini explosion when i put it in the mixture. And then, it took at least 20 minutes of beating this mixture before it even began to thicken. Wouldnt recommend this to anyone. Tastes just ok. Nothing amazing. Extremely disappointed. Tastes more like caramel than chocolate. Terrible clean up, I had to scrub the thermometer for almost 5 minutes until it even started to come off.
