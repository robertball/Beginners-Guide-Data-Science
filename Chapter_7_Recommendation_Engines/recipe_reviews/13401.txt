delicious recipe, great for the cold weather!
I used a half pound of large shrimp and cut them in half.  I also added about 2T. parsley to the butter when i sauteed the onions and celery.  Because I used about 3 c. diced potatoes, I needed more milk (about an extra 3/4 c.), but the cream cheese kept the mixture thick.  One more addition I made was 1T. of old bay.  Excellent flavor! Will make again!

1/3/10- I made this again today, a little more gourmet, but both equally as delish!!  I made a shrimp stock with the shells (adding old bay), once the stock was finished, I removed the shells and cooked the shrimp then used the stock to cook the potatoes.  I added some white wine (maybe a Tbsp) to the onion celery mixure while it was cooking, and added more half and half for more broth.  I did add about a half cup of corn niblets for color and because,,, well chowders and corn marry so well!!   OH I also added some lobster that was left from new years dinner :)  If you haven't made this yet, you really should!  Don't be nervous with the amount of cream cheese, it adds such a great, rich flavor!  And if its too thick add more milk, half and half, evaporated milk, shrimp stock or whatever you're using for the liquid in your recipe...  restaurant quality for sure!!

This was great-My kids even loved it!! I changed a few things I boiled the cubed potatoes in chicken stock until fork tender I used 3 cup of potatoes-like others added 1 tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning-added 1 can of corn-1 cup chicken stock an additional cup of milk and a few drops of Tabasco. I also served them in bread bowls GREAT RECIPE! I took some to my sister at work and her co-workers had her call me to ask where I bought it because they wanted it for lunch too =)!Thanks!

This recipe was ablsolutely fabulous!  My husband had recently had a "shrimp soup" as he called it. So I set out to make what he described. This was better than he had! The first time I made it I added a can of cream of celery soup and a can of baby clams (drain juice to use/wash and drain clams) so it was a "shrimp/clam" chowder-delicious!! The second time I made it I used a can of Cambell's Cream of Shrimp (gave a pink hue) and a can of cream of celery. I only used shrimp that time. It was still fabulous! There is not one complaint about this recipe. It would be great for cool weather especially and for a nice dinner in a bread bowl! Thanks so much!

Excellent chowder!! I used a little more celery and added some minced garlic and dried parsley (to taste) to the saute. I also used a little more potatoes (pre-cooked), which meant I had to up the liquid a little so I added 1/2 chicken broth. Finally, I also threw in a can of drained clams. Nice, thick, flavorful and a breeze to make. Take another bow Corwynn for another winning recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I was always threatened by the daunting task of making chowders as I have heard numerous times that it was tough to master a good chowder.  Anyway, I found this recipe to be :

- Very flavourful
- Very colourful ( the celery leaves and stalks make a good contrast to the pink in the shrimp, against the white creamy sauce )
- Very easy to make!

However, I did change some few things to suit it to my taste:

- I did not add the entire package of cream cheese.  I thought it was too much to do that.  I added a bit more milk though.

- Instead of the cream cheese, I added 2 low-heaped tablespoons of sifted flour, as I was stirring the soup.  This thickened up the chowder quite quickly without the fat that you find in the cream cheese.

- I also added a sage, thyme, dill dry herb mix ( around 3/4 tsps ) to give it that underlying flavour that goes so well with seafood chowders.

This is a yummy, super easy recipe!  I went to the seafood counter at the store and got the broken cocktail shrimp which worked just as well and I didn't need to thaw.  It does need old bay though, to give it a kick and a neat "shrimpy" color. A little pepper is necessary too. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was great!  I cubed and boiled the potatoes before adding them.  It would be hard to cook raw potatoes in this without burning the milk...  Also I used cracked pepper and bayleaves.  Infinite possibilites with this, use oysters or crab for the shrimp, or maybe I could try soft tofu for the cream cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought it was bland so I added a can of chicken broth,3 shakes of garlic powder, 1 bay leaf, 3 pinches of chili powder, instead of wine I used 3 tbs of sherry, shakes of tobasco, and slightly less than 1/4 cup of crumbled blue cheese. It was GREAT then

i kept the ingredients the same, but cooked it in different order. After the onions,  I added the potatoes and upped the broth to 2 cups. Cooked the potatoes for 15 minutes until tender, turned the heat down and added the milk/cream cheese. Turned out the perfect thickness, didn't burn, and was very tasty.

Great recipe. I did add a little chicken broth for some extra flavor. I also used a yellow pepper instead of celery. It was delicious. Will make it again.

Great recipe!  I added some Creole seasoning instead of salt to give it some kick.  Also, only had 4 oz cream cheese so I added a can of cream of chicken soup. Turned out fabulous.

My review is for this recipe as written. While it fitted the bill for a quick weeknight soup, I thought it was far too heavy on the cream cheese, which was mostly all we could taste. I didn't care for the heavy feel it left in my mouth either. This also makes four extremely skimpy servings. It really should read only two servings.

Gosh  this was so good! The whole familly loved it. I followed previous reviewers suggestions of using some shrimp stock, old bay seasoning, corn and one garlic clove that I sautee with the onions and celery oh and I also used low fat cream cheese and skim milk, my only regret is not doubling the recipe my husband wished I had made more. Thanks for the delicious recipe! Elvira Silva.

Delicious! I adapted it once for a slow cooker but it was not as good so I will stick to the stove-top. Also, I leave out the wine completely.

Very good recipe.  Hubby loved it.  Followed the recipe pretty much as written - added Old Bay Seasoning, Mrs Dash.  Like others I boiled the cubed potatoes and carrots in chicken broth prior to adding to the chowder.  The chowder was better the second day.

This was pretty good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added corn and boiled both the corn and potatoes in some homemade chicken stock I had.  I used fresh corn on the cob that I of course cut off the cob.  I think I should have cooked the corn and celery a little longer as they were crisp, too crisp for this type of soup.  The cream cheese was a fabulous idea, it added a nice smooth, creamy texture and taste, and it was very “mouth-pleasing”.  But there was still something missing and I couldn’t put my finger on it.  Every time I took a spoonful, I was longing for another flavor to come.  I was looking for a layered flavor, but I just wasn’t getting it.  THEN I decided to use some garlic pepper seasoning by McCormick (in the grinder) in my bowl, and that did it!!!  It completed my dining experience.  We still have some soup left in the refrigerator, so when I heat it up I’ll add the garlic pepper seasoning and see how it tastes the next day. UPDATE: This soup was great the next day after adding the garlic pepper seasoning.  I also didn’t mind the crispness of the celery and corn anymore.  By the way, the garlic pepper seasoning in the grinder has a much more intense flavor than the other stuff; it is actual dehydrated garlic, whole peppercorns, and sea salt.

Love this recipe! I turned it into an easy crock pot meal as these tend to fit my lifestyle better. As for ingredients I increased the milk to 1 & 3/4 cup like other reviewers, instead of salt I used seasoning salt, added 1 TBSP of Old Bay seasoning and 3/4 of an 11 oz can of super sweet yellow and white corn. Basically I just melted the cream cheese, milk, and margarine in a medium saucepan. Added all of the other ingredients into the crock pot with my additions and poured the melted cream cheese mixture over and cooked on low 6-8 hours. This really simplified the recipe for me!

Great recipe...when I read it I knew you would have to precook the potatoes.  I did that plus I doubled the amount as did others.  I had a small piece of salmon frozen and I threw it in.  Also used low fat cream cheese and it worked fine.  This recipes has so many possibilities and I will use it again for company!!

I liked the sound of this recipe, so thought I'd try it for dinner tonight. I added 3 gloves of garlic.  I didn't have any milk so I used cream of mushroom soup and approx. 1/2 can of water.  I added more white wine.  Didn't know if I had a dry wine. It was a Chardonney.  I added approx 1 cup.  This recipe turned out really well.  My husband really like it.

Great! I needed to add another cup of milk, though. Like others, I added Old Bay seasoning (about 1 teaspoon), and I also added 1 cup frozen corn and 8 sliced baby carrots, to add some more veggies. I will be happy to make this again!

I am a huge fan of soups and this one was very good.  I made a few changes to suit my tastes, which made it a 5 star chowder: added a bay leaf, a pressed clove of garlic (sauteed with the onion and celery in butter), and a cup of chicken broth (in addition to the milk).  I also cut back on the cream cheese to 1/2 a package.  Very yummy...I have even traded out the shrimp for a can of crab meat and it is delicious.

Turned out perfectly!  I added three ears of corn cut from the cob, substituted green pepper for the celery, added about 3 shakes of garlic powder and 3-4 healthy glugs of Frank's Red Hot sauce, paprika, fresh ground pepper and skipped the white wine.  My husband and I LOVED it and I will be making it again!!! Also, I substituted regular cream cheese for fat free and used 1% milk to cut down some of the fat and calories. :-)

Thought this soup was a nice change to my recipe for chowder.  I like the cream cheese taste in the soup, but felt it needed a bit more spices, so I added some Old Bay Seasonings and it gave it a nice flavor.  I will try this base for either clam chowder or seafood chowder.  Nice change...

Excellent soup! Very easy and flavorful. I also added corn, extra potatoes (and therefore more milk) and cooked the pots in chicken broth.  Yummy!

I really love this recipe...as a base...I also add potatoes and carrots which I boil beforehand until fork tender I then have to add more milk, a little half and half, and some chicken bouillon but then it is excellent!

Yummy! I added bacon at the start since I've always made chowder with bacon.  This was easy and the kids asked for more.

What a great chowder recipe! Added the bay leaf and some Old Bay. I sauteed the celery and onions in salted butter. This was more than enough seasoning for the chowder and it was unbelievable.

Wonderful recipe, but at the end I decided to add seasonings as others recommended and this took it to a whole new level!  I didn't have Old Bay Seasoning on hand so I looked up a copy-cat recipe and estimated additions using what I did have.  Will definitely make again!

This was really delicious, and heated up great for leftovers too. The only issue I had was the cooking time after the potatoes were added. I ended up having to cook it WAAAAY longer than suggested in order to make the potatoes soft enough and the chowder thick enough. Though once it was all cooked through it really was good, I would recommend.

Pretty good stuff!  The whole family liked it.

I used red potatoes and boiled them in chicken broth, old bay and creole seasoning.  I then sauteed the celery and onions with a little old bay and creole.  I added some frozen corn and all other ingredients as stated.

I added some additional old bay and creole to taste and it was fabulous!

This also doubles as a REALLY good chicken corn chowder if you add the corn.  Just cube up your chicken and fry it.  Then make the recipie with chicken.  Yummy!

Good recipe, but it doesn't say that you need to cook the potatos and shrimp before adding to the chowder.  If you don't boil the potatos beforehand they may come out underdone.

This was absolutely delish although i changed around the recipe a bit. Mostly because half way through cooking i realized i didn't even have milk or celery. 

I used close to a pound of thawed salad shrimp, substituted a can of cream of celery soup (+ a can of water) for the milk. Only about a half cup of very small cubed potato's (i don't really care for them) Also, i added a little extra white wine, substituted creole seasoning for salt and added a little extra, and added some celery seed and cayenne pepper. 

Oh, and i sautee'd maybe 1/8th cup of home garden banana pepper since i didnt have any celery. 

Everything turned out great and tasted great but next time i'd like to actually have milk and celery, as the soup substitute made it just a tad thicker then it should be and it made more soup because i used water to thin it out. 

Either way i highly recommend this recipe, take some liberty with it, add what you like as long as your still sticking to it for the most part, and it will taste great! I'd like to use the same base for a crab soup some time.

Great shrimp chowder! I did double the recipe, for the 5 of us.  I added some minced garlic, cayenne pepper and some Old Bay.  I cooked the potatoes in chicken stock and used about a cup of liquid to thin the chowder a tad.  Served in Italian Bread Bowls from this site.  Will add to my recipe box!!

I read all the reviews on this chowder and then combined the suggestions as follows (I doubled the recipe BTW): Precooked the potatoes in 2 cans of chicken broth and reserved the cooking liquid, Added 1 Tbsp. minced garlic and 2 Tbsp. of dried parsley flakes when I sauted the celery after omitting the onions (picky eaters), warmed up the cream cheese in micro in order to speed up the melting in the soup pot, added a few drops of Tabasco sauce and a bay leaf, added 2 cups slightly defrosted frozen whole kernel corn with shrimp and omitted the wine. After adding the shrimp, corn, salt and pepper; the chowder was a little too thick so I added 2 cups of the reserved chicken broth from the potatoes. Next time I'll add a half cup at a time until the desired thickness is reached; it ended just a little too thin for my tastes. Anyway, after alll these changes my family was happily surprised with this dish. Don't know if I'll make it again though:)

I mashed the cooked potatoes slightly and added a little more wine--a very good recipe and very delicious-I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and you couldn't tell.

I made this soup last night and can I tell all of you just how truly fast a delicious it was!!!!! I will tell you my changes. First I did not have any celery so instead I sauted the potatoes with the onion because they will cook faster. then I added the block of cream cheese and 2 cups of milk and gently melted down the cream cheese. Then I added one defrosted shrimp ring (tails removed) and 1 can of baby clams with half the juice a little salt and lots of pepper. It made 4 hearty bowls for my husband and I. I will be making this for some friends on the weekend, totally satisfied with this chowder...

I was looking for a recipe to use the frozen shrimp in my freezer and this was excellent! I did things a little differently though. I used a slow cooker and instead of celery I put in cream of celery soup. I cut the shrimp into pieces. I also did not use the dry white wine. It cooked in the slow cooker for about 8 hours. This was the first time I've ever had chowder and it was scrumptous! I will definitely make this again!

Good basic recipe.  Prefer not to use cream cheese.  I added more milk and thickeded with instant potato flakes before serving. Add potato before shrimp or the shrimp will overcook and be tough.  Easy to enlarge measures of ingredients to produce larger or more servings.

This was delicious and quite easy to make.  I followed the recipe, but as others suggested, I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth and then added the potatoes and some of the broth.  I also added Old Bay to taste.  To make it easier, I also used cooked salad shrimp...it was the perfect size and I didn't have to take off shells or cut up the shrimp.

4.5 The deli had shrimp and bacon on sale but otherwise THEIR recipe (in their flyer) was JUST the same as this recipe minus the chopped bacon which got fried up first and really added to the flavour.  Also added Old Bay seasoning instead of salt and had fresh shrimp, awesome.

Fantastic!  I was in a hurry to make something for dinner b4 I picked up my kids from play practice.  This threw together in about 15 minutes.  I added four drops of liquid smoke, minced garlic (about one tbls), old bay seasoning, onion powder, and chicken broth (to make it stretch a little).  I sauteed the onion, garlic, celery, and celery leaves in evoo with one tbls of butter.  everything else I threw in and whisked together.  Should have doubled the recipe!  Excellent.

Basic idea is good.  Feel it serves 2 not 4.  I added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne.  Needs a little something to give it zing.  May even add corn next time.

My family liked it, but not I.For me there was the cream cheese that got in the way.To much. Tasted funny. I will try one more time but only will use a 1/4 of it instead of the whole thing.

This was simply delicious! I added more milk because it was really too thick. I poured this over angel hair pasta w/ hushpuppies on the side. Thank you!

I made this with less cream cheese than the recipe calls for but it still turned out Great. Looked really good too... I love for food to look as good as it tastes. I think next time I'll try some cream of celery soup in it as another reviewer did.

There is not alot of flavor in this soup. I made it according to the directions, then added everything that others had recommended and still wasn't satisfied.  Would not make it again.

This is a very good recipe.  I followed some others advice and added garlic to the sauted onions and celery.  I also used one pound of shrimp instead of 1/2 lb.  I cooked the potatoes ahead of time, which is a must.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth, since I had more shrimp.  Finally, I added 1 T. of Old Bay Seasoning, which really made the dish.  If you do nothing else, still add Old Bay!   Oh yea, I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese (microwaved it 30 seconds to soften) and it still tasted great.  It's great served with bread for dunking!

Though the end result of this recipe seems like something closer to potato soup than a seafood soup, it's an excellent recipe nonetheless.  I doubled the recipe and still didn't seem to have a very good volume of soup.  Melting the cream cheese on low takes a LONG time, but I suppose the low temperature is necessary so the cheese doesn't ball up and melts thoroughly.  I added a little extra milk so the soup would "go further."  I also added some white pepper when I added the salt.  Next time, I may use more shrimp.  There wasn't really enough.

Average. Nothing to write home about. I had to add a lot of ingredients to make it more flavoursome. Small sprinkle chilli powder, can of corn, three teaspoons of powdered chicken flavouring, herbs, vegetable salt and only then it was sort of okay.

The whole family loved this chowder!  Great flavor and texture, and I went by the (doubled) recipe except that I substituted butter for the margarine.  It's high on the family's request list.  Thanks!

This recipe is bland as is and needs extra seasoning. I'm going to add garlic, bay leaves and perhaps red pepper and see if that helps. Easy enough to fix and modify though.

made this tonight for dinner.  great base to start with but after reading some of the reviews I added a cream of potato soup to help thicken the sauce and definitely needed more seasoning.. I used Old bay we like it heavy... salt pepper and a touch of garlic powder.... nice thick chowder! oh and I also added corn cuz what is a chowder without it!

I really liked this.  I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and served it in a puff pastry shell.  It was so quick and easy but yet fancy. :)

I boiled my diced potatoes in salted water and added the shrimp for a minute when the potatoes were almost done.  I also added a bay leaf and chopped fresh parsley to the soup because I had some on hand.  I also served it with Tabasco for my spicy loving husband.

This was excellent!  I did however tweak it a bit.  I made my own shrimp stock with the legs, shells, and onion.  Then I just did the recipe the way it was written.  My family loved it.

Very creamy!  Took the advice and added the potatoes with the onion and celery.  Next time I'll saute on low, I burnt the bottom of the pot.  I also microwaved the room temperature cream cheese for a minute on half power and it blended very easily!  And I added cinnamon at the end - yummy!!

I had some problems with this recipe...waiting for the potatoes to cook was horrible. I kept worrying about burning the milk which by the way, I had to add about a cup more of it. I must have had some extra thick cream cheese or something because it looked more like a sauce then a chowder without the extra milk. Definately boil the potatoes first and be ready to add a lot more spices because it will be very bland without them.

this was a very good chowder. i added alittle more white wine about 2 tbsp. more and 1/4 cup half and half. i also used 1 four ounce can of bumblebee tiny select shrimp chopped,and drained instead of the 1/2 pound of shrimp.this was perfect, a taste of shrimp without the fishy smell.

Modified this recipe alot using all the past reviews and my family really liked.  Don't know how it would be in it's original format.  Like most people I used O'Brien potatoes, 1 can of corn, old bay seas.  I also used neufchatel cheese instead of crm cheese and only used half of the recommended amount.

Excellent recipe for shrimp!  I did make a few modifications:  added Old Bay Seasoning, a small can of corn, and garlic.  It was a big hit on Christmas Eve and will make again for New Year's Eve.

This recipe needed more flavor. I added more white wine to make it less stiff. I tried it with shripm, corn potatoes and mushrooms. Added a lot of cayenne and some yellow and red peppers for flavor. This recpe is a good base, but you really need to get creative with it to make it special.

We enjoyed this recipe. I did double it for I have a lot of mouths to feed.
It was great. I did one thing extra to it......I added boiled shrimp and
battered shrimp leftover from last night. The battered shrimp in shrimp
chowder is a "PLUS" all should try it that way. You can not use just battered 
shrimp for your chowder would be too thick.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used only 4oz cream cheese and added 2 cans of chopped clams, (1 with liquid and 1 can drained). I'll definitely make this again but will add the whole 8 oz of cheese.

I made this with fresh shrimp. 1 1/2 pounds instead of half pound. Cut them in 3rds. Sautéd them in butter and garlic before adding to soup. No wine but added a cup of water and two bullion cubes.  Husband said it was best new recipe yet - loved it!

Easy but very rich if made from original recipe. I added 3 cups potatoes (cooked and chopped), substituted chopped broccoli stalk for celery, 1.5 cups milk, around 2.5 cups defrosted frozen shrimp and 1.5 cups chicken stock. It was great and less rich.

I loved it but next time I will parboil the potatoes to speed up cooking time. I only added 1/2 block of cream cheese and two cans of evaporated milk. I added 2 cloves of garlic, minced and 1 tbsp of dried parsley for colour. I added a can of baby clams with its water for more flavour.

We really liked this recipe and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was b/c if I hadn't read other reviews first, I wouldn't have known to cook the potatoes and soften the cream cheese before adding them to avoid frustration and/or burning the milk due to the long melt/cook time.  I followed the recipe except for these changes: I omitted the celery & salt and substituted 1/4 tsp of celery salt because I didn't have any celery on hand. I increased the onions to 2/3 cup b/c we like onions.  I used Neufchatel cheese in place of the cream cheese and softened it in the microwave before adding it to the stock pot to reduce time needed to melt it.  It still took a while to melt, though.  I upped the potatoes to 3 cups and boiled them in one can of reduced sodium chicken broth with 1 Tbsp of Old Bay and when the potatoes were fork tender, I added the entire mixture.  We had 17 extra large-sized shrimp (which had been steamed with Old Bay) leftover from Christmas, and I cut them into bite sized pieces before adding.  I also used 2 cups frozen white corn (b/c I can't imagine chowder without corn), 1 extra Tbsp Old Bay (we're from MD and love our Old Bay!), and 1/4 tsp white pepper.  This made 6 cereal-sized bowls of soup.  I was full after one bowl, but my husband ate THREE because he thought it was so good!  This could easily make a meal if served with salad and/or crusty bread.  Or as another reviewer suggested, serve it in a bread bowl.  Thanks for a great starter recipe!

We thought this was really good! I only used half the cream cheese, doubled the potatoes (cooked in water with 2 chicken bouillon cubes, then drained), added some frozen corn and I also added quite a bit of old bay seasoning. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I added quite a few things to add flavor (doubled the wine, touch of cayenne, chili powder and hot sauce) so I didn't give it 5 stars.  It's a good base, though!

My wife hates celery. She also hates clam chowder. Even so, she loved this soup--the celery gave it a slight crunch and the cream cheese really made for a rich base. We both loved it! Thank you!

This soup was wonderful! We cooked the potatoes before adding to the soup. We added the Old Bay sesoning. It was perfect. My family loved it. Thanks for sharing.

This is great! Not hard to make either.  I added sliced asparagus to the onions and celery, hot sauce towards the end and more white wine. Everyone enjoyed it, will definitely make again. Doubled the recipe and it made plenty.

I made this for a progressive dinner for 12 and they raved about it. Used a bag of potatoes O'Brien, frozen corn and some diced yellow and red peppers. Also added a tbspn of Old Bay. Everyone had seconds and want the recipe.

The boyfriend and I loved it, but made a few changes to accomodate what we had on hand: (also doubled servings by time we were through)
1 can (+ 1 can h20) cream of chicken soup, used veggie and regular cream cheese, added carrots and corn, clove of garlic, chili spice, Sriracha Chili Paste, and added 8 oz. crayfish tail meat.
I loved this recipe(even though we doctored it a bit)! Will def. make again!

Made this for my boyfriend and he said it was the best "soup" he had ever had! This from a man who never goes beyond saying anything is better than "good".  He likes things a little spicier - so I added some black pepper, cayenne pepper, and tobasco sauce.  Great and easy - my favorite combination - will be making this again and again!

This recipe has some serious flaws:

The recipe doesn't specify that the called-for potatoes need to be cooked before the soup is assembled. They  are added just before the soup is warmed for serving. I scurried at the last minute to boil the potatoes 

Also, the "warming" doesn't allow sufficient time for the wine to cook off, leaving a harsh "booziness." 

The recipe also doesn't suggest dicing the  shrimp. This is nnot a major issue, and may be a matter of taste.

All that being said, I made the soup, using a half-pound of jumbo shrimp (twelve). I sauteed the raw shrimp (fresh, in my case)  (shells  on) late in the prepping of the onion/celery mix, thinking this would -- if only slightly -- enhance  soup's eventual flavor. I peeled (and diced) the shrimp after they were all but cooked (about five or six minutes) in the vegetable.

The soup is OK. A bit boozy from the  uncooked wine. Perhaps the wine should have been added with the sauteing vegetables?

I might make it again....a bit wiser about the details next time.

Lesson learned: always read a recipe closely (process, as well as called-for ingredients) before starting. Mea culpe.

we made this recipe tonight and the flavor is delicious but I feel like the recipe is missing something. when you get it all together it barely made any liquid. it didn't even cover the potatoes and shrimp pieces. this definitely would not serve 4 people. we added some chicken stock, flour, heavy cream and corn starch to make enough liquid to even cook the potato chunks. however, super delicious!!!!

I made a keto version of this! It is amazing! I didn't use potatoes, added a couple potatoes, didn't use any milk, and added a little chicken stock instead. It seriously never occurred to me to use cream cheese as a thickener. 10/10

This was a good, basic recipe. I am only giving 3 stars because I had to tweak it - the potatoes really need to be cooked before adding them to the milk. I needed to add 1 cup of water plus a spoon of better than bouillion to the milk and cheese. I took the suggestion of others and added old bay to the celery and onion. I also added a can of drained corn. Topped my bowl with fresh parsley and a shake of Tabasco.

Made a double recipe. 
The only changes I made was adding a can of cream of celery soup because I didn't have enough celery...and added some parsley and a bit of Old Bay seasoning. 
I ended up putting it in a slow cooker because I was called away and all went  well

We didn't have celery and added extra potatoes and milk. We added the potatoes first and then waited until they were cooked through to add the shrimp since it was already cooked. I didn't want it to be over cooked. Really easy and yummy though.

I used a whole pound of shrimp and cut them in half.  I also added a 10 oz box of lightly sauced corn with the potatoes.  It added to t he richness of the soup.  My husband loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

Easy to make and tasted great. Of course I did not follow the recipe . I used it for inspiration and add what struck my fancy.

This is delicious. I made half a recipe and did add 1/2 tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning and about 1 cup of drained canned corn to the chowder after reading some of the reviews. It was great without the Old Bay but better with it and the corn gave it a nice flavor and made it a complete meal. It was very thick, which is fine but I did add 1 cup more of whole milk to make enough for the two of us. It was still very thick and chowder-like. It was very easy to make. Hubby saw the recipe in Allrecipes magazine and asked me to make it, and he likes it well enough to have it again. Despite the great flavor, I must say it is hard on my conscience with all the cream cheese and milk! So I guess it will be a special treat instead of day to day dinner. I served it with crusty garlic parmesan cheese toast.

This was just ok as the chowder was very thick and quite bland.  I halved the cream cheese,  added more milk and some Old Bay seasoning.

After reading all the good reviews, I was sorely disappointed in this mess. Hardy any broth (should have realized that when I saw there was only one cup of milk in it for the liquid!), hardly any flavor (even though I listened to other reviews and added Old Bay Seafood Seasoning, garlic powder, and even some Red Lobster Seafood Seasoning), too thick... simply a terrible meal. I definitely won't waste my time making this one again, sorry.

Delicious, like everyone says. Picky 4 year-old ate it. Second round modifications: substituted  milk for broth, added half cup of corn, Old Bay seasoning, and used up leftover mashed potatoes in place of the cubed potatoes. If you want to thin out chowder: add milk or broth. To thicken, I added potato flakes. Excellent baseline recipe to modify for your family's needs.

I made some changes and additions. I didn't have celery or white wine so I substituted canned cream of celery soup for the milk & celery, added 3 cups chicken broth to simmer the potatoes in and I didn't peel the mini potatoes because I prefer the taste and nutrition of leaving the skins on, added some sauteed chopped red pepper and baby carrot coins to the sautéed onions & mixed them with sautéed shallots, used a tub of Philadelphia jalapeño cream cheese instead of plain cream cheese to give the chowder a kick and for flavoring, cooked the chowder with 2 bay leaves, mixed peppercorns, paprika, dill and parsley, mixing in 1/4 cup capers and 3 chopped scallions at the last minute. Ambrosia!

This turned out really well. I did substitute carrots for celery. I also added pepper, garlic powder, and tarragon. Did not have white wine, so two tablespoons of lemon juice went in instead. This was a great method to make the chowder and turned out wonderful.

Turned out rich and creamy. I added a little extra onion and celery to match my taste. I missed the shrimp taste in the soup bust that may have been from the ingredients I used.

Very good!  Per other reviews, I cooked the potatoes first in vegetable broth.  Reserved 1 cup of broth to add to soup.  Used skim milk and lowfat cream cheese.(trying to save calories and fat).  Added 1 T old bay seasoning.  Used 2 cups of potatoes and 12 oz of shrimp.  Serves 4 very small portions.

I made it with the shredded (raw) hashbrowns you can find in the dairy case. They're soft and cook very quickly. 
This was a bit thick for me, so I boiled the shrimp tails into a broth and added that with some Old Bay. Very good! Cream cheese is a great way to make a cream soup.

I doubled the milk and wine (I used sweet Moscato). It helped slot for my family and friends that joined us because the recipe was too creamy. It turned out great and we served it with corn bread.

My 9-year-old daughter helped me whip this up in nothing flat! We used chicken broth in place of the wine, and she used her nose to add a generous pinch each of basil, dill, and summer savory. It was a hit!!

Delicious starter recipe! I sautéed the onion, celery and 1/2 a chopped red pepper in a teaspoon of coconut oil. I added 4oz cream cheese, 8oz evaporated milk, 4oz almond milk and 8oz chicken broth. I then chose to add 1 precooked chopped sweet potato, 1 can creamed corn and 1/2 cup frozen corn.  I cooked the shrimp in a tsp of coconut oil and added it last.  I seasoned it with 1 tsp creole seasoning, dried parsley, oregano and a dash of red pepper. WOW!!!

Astonishingly delicious!  And very straightforward preparation.  I did use larger frozen shrimp (16-22 per 1 lb. bag).  The chowder is visually appealing, as well.  I suppose because it is not a roux-based chowder - thickening coming from the cream cheese - the surface remained shiny without turning pasty.  Just lovely!

Made this because I had leftover frozen "salad" shrimp.  It was wonderful! Using ideas from other reviewers and because I needed to stretch it just a bit, I added more potatoes (I cooked them first), corn, and a can of chopped clams - juice and all.  I also used Old Bay after a taste test seemed bland. Everyone liked it - and my daughter added some leftover bacon to her bowl - she claimed it only made it better!

I would cook the shrimp in the chicken broth base, otherwise the soup tastes rather fishy. Otherwise it was a decent recipe. I added more potatoes as other raters mentioned, for me it was too many potatoes and not enough veggies.

This was delicious! I added a 15 oz. can of cream-style corn and about half a cup of frozen corn.
