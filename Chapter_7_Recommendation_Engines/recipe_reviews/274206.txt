My family are soup lovers.  This one is very good.  The only change I've made is the onion powder.  Chemicals in it.  I use real onion.   If you have somebody that doesn't like onion, just run them thru the blender.  I've changed a lot of kids that didn't like onions with this tactic.  What they really don't like is biting into the onion.  They actually like the flavor.    Besides, onions are good for you.

Fantastic side dish. Flavors blend well together. Might want to beer to the recipe or to pair with. Cook the leftover bacon and make BLTs or Bacon Burgers to eat with the meal
