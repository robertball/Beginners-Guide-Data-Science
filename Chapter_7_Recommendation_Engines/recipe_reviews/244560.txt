I added lemon pepper and garlic salt before cooking. Turned out perfect. Husband said it tasted like it could be at a carving station at a wedding. Great economical meal for serious meat eaters. I paid $10 for my piece of eye of round that fed a family of four (with 2 sides) and had some for sandwiches the next day.

This recipe is awesome!!!!  I did not have an eye of the round roast so I used a bottom round roast instead.  I followed the recipe exactly and sliced the meat thin using a food slicer.  The gravy is to die for!!  The trick is to not hurry the gravy.  I actually started the gravy in a pan on the stove top and then added the juices from the roaster when the meat was done.  This gave the gravy time to thicken and the flavors to merge together.  I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh, sliced, cooked carrots.  Yummy!!  :)

This was really good! Only changes I made is to add salt to the gravy. I also added a little corn starch to thicken it up a bit because we like our gravy a little thicker. YUM! Thanks!

Very good recipe. My meat was 4 pound eye of round and needed a little more time. Two hours would be perfect. I added carrots, onions and celery to the cooking meat with a bit of stock. The gravy was good but needed salt and thickening. Got good reviews from the family.

I went by the directions and ingredients on this recipe.  I found the sauce to be a bit runny.   I added a little bit of flour, just to thicken it up.   I also found it needed salt.   

It was just ok.   I would probably opt to try something different next time.

Nothing wrong with the roast itself, but we found the gravy to be very bland and too thin. If I make this again, I will definitely add some Worcestershire sauce, some onion soup mix, and some cornstarch to thicken it up a little more. Hopefully that’ll dress it up a bit!

I didn't use all of the ingredients called for in the gravy recipe, but it was still super yummy and simple to make! Full bellies all around.

This recipe is great! I only had a chuck roast on hand, so I didn't roast it as long as the recipe stated. But, I then took it out and let it cool a bit while I finished the recipe, then sliced it and  put it back into the gravy and returned it to the oven...at 250° for 1/2 hr. My hubby loved it, seeved with mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. Note: My asparagus recipe is to cut 2 cups into 1" pieces. Steam or boil until tender crisp. Strain. Melt 1/4 c butter. Wile that is melting, handcrush 1 row (20) Ritz crackers...in its packaging. Transfer  asperagus to bowl. Top with crackers and drizzle with melted butter. Enjoy!

Good, but I didn’t have beef stock, only broth so it wasn’t as flavorful as it would have been with the stock.

As written, the onion overpowers the flavor of the gravy. With less onion and a beef bullion cube, this is much better.

The cook time and temp was very accurate for medium-rare. I love onions, but even for me this had too much...maybe half onion or onion soup mix instead next time. Was fairly easy, but not great taste. Gravy looked great, I made it exactly as recipe calls for (except my parsley wasn't fresh but dried) and it was just too plain. Probably won't make again. My kids wouldn't touch it.

Easy and delicious meal. The hardest part was getting the meat to the right doneness. Meat thermometers are a cooks best friend. I will definitely make this again adding salt during the process.

Very delicious! I love the ingredients -- flavorful w/o using the traditional onion soup mix...I made this in a pressure cooker. Browned the roast on both sides, then added potatoes, carrots, and pearl onions. It cooked up quickly and perfectly, and took about half the time as roasting in the oven.  Thanks, Swanson's!
