This was really good.  I added shrimp when I turned the fish over and also added a bag of fresh spinach.

This was pretty good and very healthy. To add some flavor I suggest cooking in butter instead of olive oil. It also needed a lot of salt and extra spices in my opinion. I also added some parmesan cheese on top when the juices were evaporating. I would also suggest serving this with pasta. Over all a very good dish, but needs a few minor adjustments to make it even better.

Not bad after significant tinkering.  Rather than simmering the seafood in the tomatoes, I grilled a nice piece of sea bass along with the shrimp and some beautiful scallops on our Cuisinart Griddler while my wife cooked the tomatoes and garlic with some shallots and fresh parsley.  We preferred to omit the boldly flavored oregano.  A fresh-tasting, light but satisfying, healthy and delicious dish.  We served this with pasta with garlic and oil and a green salad.

Very good.  I used haddock, catfish, and pre-cooked shrimp because that's what I had on hand.  I used a large can of the diced tomatoes in basil, oregano, and garlic.  I chopped up about 6-7 large cloves a garlic, browned them in olive oil in my Wok, added the haddock and catfish.  Added the diced tomatoes and an additional small can of tomato sauce and 1tblspn of dried oregano.  Then,  I sprinkled about a tblspn of fresh cracked pepper into the mix.  Once the fish was cooked through, I added a couple handfuls of fresh baby spinach (very exact measurement, I know!)  Once that was wilted, I added the shrimp and about 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  I cooked about another 5 minutes to heat up the shrimp.  Finally, I served it over spaghetti with fresh baked dinner rolls.  Yum!

This was a delicious, light, and simple recipe. I added olives and capers and some powdered seasoning. I also added recao instead of just garlic and preseasoned the fish and shrimp lightly. A great recipe for when you want to eat light and healthy.

This was very good with a rich but not overpowering flavor.   I used butter instead of olive oil, doubled the fresh garlic & used Hunt's canned diced tomatoes w/ garlic & oregano.  Delicious!

After reading the reviews I decided to tweak a few things & I must say this was an outstanding dish. First of all seaso. Your cod & shrimp well. Secondly, I wanted to use some leftover cremini mushrooms that I sliced. I also added 1/4 onions slivered thin. After getting nice & caramelized, I added the garlic. Then I added a heaping tablespoon tomato paste from the tube. When I diced the tomatoes, I seasoned them well with garlic salt & pepper then I added Italian iseasonings & the oregano then added some chili flakes for a little kick. I also had some roasted jarred red peppers in the pantry so I slivered some of them up as well. I defrosted a package of chopped spinach squeezed dry, added capers & sliced martini olives. As a rule I generally follow the original recipe to the letter the first time but this was screaming more. The one thing that made this dish even more outstanding was a couple squeezed Meyer lemons over the entire dish. Then I grated some reggiano Parm on top. Note: I served this over angel hair pasta. While shopping at walmart one day I came across small boxes of Walmart brand spaghetti which is cut in half. No more getting out the big pot. I just throw in a handful in salted boiling water & it's so mush easier to drain & eat.

I made this recipe as written and everyone thought it was very flavorful. I think the key is to use fresh garlic! Also, I used canned tomatoes and it was great!

This is now my FAVORITE recipe! So easy to make and tasted great. I  didn't chop the tomatoes as small as the photo and I had my doubts as I had to squeeze the fish and shrimp to fit in my pan...but, my husband loved it and thought I was a genius!

This will now be my go to recipe for cod!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the shrimp, which I did not have on hand.  This is an easy and delicious way to poach cod in tomatoes and spices!  I will be making this again and again!

recipe def needs more seasoning. I added the shrimp after I flipped the fish & used butter instead of olive oil. Fresh garlic is key & we added asparagus also!

This was just ok, I added a little more oregano than called for to help spice it up.  It was also improved by a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese on top.  If I were to make this again, I would consider adding some other herbs and/or vegetables.

I've made this a few times now and the recipe is good as written. My favorite variation though is to add puttanesca favors. I sauté Onions, 2-3 chopped Anchovie fillets, and garlic in a pan. Then add the tomatoes, and season with oregano, red pepper flakes, Capers, and Olive Tapenade when the sauce comes together a bit. After cooking Fish and shrimp through in the sauce I serve over pasta, Polenta or add Italian vegetables as a side.

Just made this for dinner, and it turned out great!  Even though I seeded the tomatoes, it was very juicy.  Next time will serve with crusty or garlic bread to soak up the sauce.  Ate it with white rice, followed the recipe as is, except used less oregano and added frozen cooked shrimp during the last 3 minutes covered and cooked for 5 minutes uncovered.  Would definitely make again!

Made this again last week and added some julienned sundried tomatoes packed in oil, which added flavor.

I've been making  a similar recipe like this for years using diced tomatoes. The shrimp is a nice add.  This is a great weight friendly as well as healthy recipe.

I make this once a month or so since I found the recipe. I add scallops, use fire roasted diced tomatos, and serve over brown rice or angel hair pasta, with a salad. One of my favorite meals!

We tried this last night and I did make some adjustments.  I added some shallots with the garlic, probably several tablespoons.  I also peppered the cod and shrimp, and added pepper when I put the tomatoes in the skillet.  I think next time, I'll add capers and perhaps some additional fresh herbs.  I served it over Barilla Plus angel hair pasta and with crusty bread.  It was really good and I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Excellant recipe, I followed the recipe with the exception of, I didn't have whole tomatoes so I used 1 can 14.5oz of diced tomatoes. I will be making this easy and quick dish again but we like a little more bite so I will use 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes just to add a little heat. I reccomend this recipe to everyone.

Good healthy recipe. Could use a little more spice :)I did use haddock instead of the cod d/t the price.  On sale for $ 6.99/lb and the cod was $9.99/lb
Simple ingrediants and easy to put together. Thanks for sharing

Low calorie and tasty. We had dieters, diabetics, and low-fat menu guests and this was perfect for all.  Grilled some tomatoes and chili peppers, removed some seeds, and blended in a food processor to serve on the side. (Remove the tomato skins, but not the chili skins, salt to taste. )

A little bland. Will make it again in summer as tomatoes from the grocery in Pa are not so tasty.  Added capers as was noted in another review. But also added a little cayenne pepper which really boosted the flavors.

Made it today, will be part of our meal rotation from now on, really loved it. I just  seasoned the cod with salt and pepper then fried it in olive oil, removed from the pan then I sauteed the garlic on the same pan then add the seasoned tomato sauce I got from Costco. I added two tsp. of capers to the sauce and fresh oregano from the garden.  Placed the shrimp and scallop in the pan, and when it is cooked I put the cod back just for another minute and serve. Really Good, Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was, according to my husband, a dinner worthy to be served in a 5-star restaurant, and I agree!  I pretty much made according to original recipe, but I did use a big bunch of scallions, and Fire roasted tomatoes and parsley and lemon zest. Served with saffron rice. Delicious!  Company worthy!

Made it as written except used halved cherry tomatoes. Very sweet. Also added spinach and shrimp after turning the fish. Excellent!!!  Definitely a keeper.

Super flavorful and no guilt if you eat it by itself as I did.  Sure it would be amazing with pasta or rice but for resetters, paleo, No Sugar, etc. this is great, easy and fast.

I'm not a big pasta person, nor do I like meat sauce.  But THIS was amazing! Best pasta dish I have ever had! Served it with brown rice pasta noodles because I'm celiac. Absolutely AMAZING. And for those wanting to eat clean, IT'S CLEAN!

Made this last night for two.  I used a little extra Italian spices and my husband flipped over it.  Lots of flavor for the pallet and texture/color for the eyes!

Delicious!  I added teaspoon of sugar on the simmering tomatoes and then sprinkled on Parmesan cheese.  Used fresh oregano from the garden.  Easy dinner.  Served it with Brussel spouts and Artisan bread.

I made this recipe with chicken and shrimp because I am not a cod lover.  It turned out great!m I also made multigrain pasta to pour it over!  I, like other viewers, used butter instead of olive oil and I also added some basil to add flavor!  I cooked the tomatoes a lil longer than the recipe called for because my husband is not a fan of the texture of tomatoes.  The meal turned out GREAT!  The only thing that I would do next time is add a few more seasonings for a bolder flavor but all in all it was a great recipe.

PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.  LIKE DINING IN A SUPPER CLUB IN OTTAWA - Brings back memories in me.   There was enough left over for another meal for 2.  Had no oregano in the house and had to stoop to using  Fines Herbes Provencales.  It was like amazing.  Next time it will be oregano for sure.  Thanks for this A+ recipe.

Very healthy meal. I added lemon juice and a tea spoon of old bay seasoning. I also served it with cauliflower risotto, to keep the calorie count down, otherwise this would be great with pasta.

Oh,my, what a delicious fish & seafood stew! This is simple, fast and, while not fancy or elegant, absolutely wonderful. You'll want to serve it with crusty bread or rice or something, so as not to lose any of the tasty broth. I followed the recipe closely (ok, I used jarred, minced garlic; I'm lazy). Next time I might throw in some arugula, to represent green veggies, but I don't know. I see someone else added capers, also a good idea. The thing is, it's wonderful without any additions.

This dish is the bomb!  I used Italian Seasonings which has oregano in it (same proportion as the oregano called for in the recipe),  for the tomatoes I used roma, probable diced up 7, and a sweet onion.  Wow! GREAT flavor. Thanks for this recipe. :)

I made the basics of this last night, but because we have a large garden I had a lot of fresh vegetables available.  I used fresh San Marzano tomatoes (they are very meaty) along with yellow squash, zucchini, red sweet pepper and onions. Cooked all of this until it reduced by half then added my cod, followed by the shrimp. It was great, my husband loved it.

This was good but it was lacking in flavour.  The garlic and oregano wasn't enough seasoning for me. I may try it again w/ other changes.  Thanks for sharing.

For two people:  Kind of turned it into a new recipe.   I cooked sliced onions and mushrooms with the garlic (used 4 cloves and half butter/half olive oil).  Used ital seasoning vice oregano.  I used almost two 14.5 oz cans Italian Style diced tomatoes, drained (but not dry).  I used 2 Costco tilapia, fillets cut into bite size pieces and about a pound of large shrimp (tails removed).  After the first 3 minutes of cooking I gave a stir, made sure the fish/shrimp were pretty much cooked, and covered with fresh spinach.  I covered, and cooked (stirring some) until the spinach wilted.  Sprinkled with fresh grated Parmesan cheese, stirred once more, and served with french bread.  Didn't use any pasta with all the extra fish and shrimp.  Soooooo  yummy!   I used a deep skillet.

Very good! You could easily add other vegetables in with the tomatoes, such as onion or spinach. I will try that the next time.

I used original rotelle tomatoes because we like spicy.  Sauted garlic and an onion, then added tomates and cooked to reduce the tomato liquid.  Added cod and right before serving added raw shrimp and cooked just till pink.   Served over rice.  was a hit with my boys.  They added hot sauce but it was spicy enough for me with the Rotelle tomatoes.

I made this recipe on a Sunday. It is delicious, fast and very easy.

I did make a few alterations, though, both to save time and to my preferences:

I used one 15oz can of diced tomatoes (no salt added) along with two large plum tomatoes. 

I added thinly sliced red onion (about a cup) and I sliced my garlic into thin slivers rather than mincing it.

I cooked the tomatoes, onions and garlic most of the way first and then put them aside in a bowl.

I seasoned and placed the cod in the same pan and juices I cooked the tomato mixture in. When I flipped the fish, I poured the tomato mixture over it and cooked it covered for the final 3 minutes.

The shrimp I did separately while the fish and tomatoes were cooking. We love Ina Garten's Roasted Shrimp recipe (it cooks them perfectly and deliciously every single time) so we did that. 

I added the shrimp when I plated everything. 

This is a very healthy meal and it is done in a snap.

Rob~

I followed the recipe as this was my first time to make this dish, It was actually easy to make. I used the spray version of extra virgin olive oil to sautee the garlic, tomatoes. Putting the cod and shrimp on top to cook kept the fish moist. I served it over spaghetti noodles. I will make again.

We loved this and added it to our monthly menu.  I cooked my tomatoes separate from my fish however and added a scant TBS tomato paste to the tomatoes, then oregano.  
On the fish, I used a bit of my favorite (fish) rub, sent my husband out on our icy debt to grill the cod and  shrimp, he brushed a little butter and hot sauce on the shrimp.  Just before serving I added the fish over the tomatoes.  I didn't cook it with the tomatoes because it makes the fish (to my mind a bit mushy)

As written, dish was ok. It became 4 stars cooking again after more spices, cooking in butter and lots of garlic. We felt good about eating healthy.  Mmmmm butter

Really good.  Served over rice, adjusted oregano to taste and added two handfuls of fresh spinach toward end of cooking time.  Easy, healthy and very tasty.

I made it following the recipe, with the addition of capers.  I used precooked shrimp which was a mistake. Use green shrimp instead. I also used fresh oregano rather than dried.   Served sans pasta, but with a Sauvignon Blanc.  Very good and flavorful.  Next time I will use green shrimp, and add parmesan reggiano.

If you love fluffy moist fish - this is AMAZING. I used parmesan cheese, Italian stewed + fresh garden tomatoes, and topped it off with extra parmesan cheese + freshly minced parsley.

I’m on a very restricted diet, and everything in this recipe is on my good list! We cooked it a little longer, also added spinach, and served it over Trader Joe’s organic brown rice pasta.  Delicious!! Will definitely make again.

I loved this.  I used some light butter instead of the oil, and the cod I used had a lemon herb seasoning on it.  I cut down the garlic because I don’t like that much.  I also tossed in some sliced zucchini and squash, about 1.5 cups, since I had it in the fridge to use up.  Healthy and light.  I’ll def be making it again.

It was very good.  I added a mixture of seafood soup which included mussels, scallops and a sausage.  I also used the Hunts diced tomato with Garlic, Basil and Oregano.  My boyfriend loved it!

I have never cooked cod fish before, but I really enjoyed this dish! My girls enjoyed it as well. I did, however, season the fish and shrimp before I added them to the tomato mixture. I also seasoned the entire dish with the same seasonings - Zatarain's season salt, onion powder, and garlic powder.

Really good staple! I did make a lot of changes and it's definitely a new favorite! 
I used butter and olive oil to brown the garlic.  Added rosemary,  basil,  onion powder,  salt,  garlic salt to the tomatoes and oregano. Also added capers,  spinach and parmesan cheese.  I used canned diced tomatoes and fresh garlic.  I also seasoned my cod and shrimp before hand with Tony Chacheres seasoning.  Served over cauliflower rice for a great low carb dish.

This recipe is good. I serve d with pasta. I do however sauteed the cod and shrimp in butter and added a splash of white wine before adding it to the tomatoes. I followed the suggestion of using canned basil, garlic tomatoes. I added a few more tomatoes that I chopped coarsely. Will make it again.

This was really good, but I did make some changes.  I'm very funny about seafood texture, so I grilled the cod and shrimp.  Added a couple of handfuls of spinach at the end, and served over spaghetti drizzled with olive oil.  I consider myself a good cook but I've not been very happy with my results lately....this is probably the best dish I've cooked in a while.

Per some of the other suggestions, I used butter instead of olive oil, and fresh garlic. Added Old Bay Seasoning and Tony Chachore's Cajun Seasoning to the fish and shrimp, and served atop Pasta Roni brand Garlic and Olive Oil Vermicelli. With those tweaks, this was far from bland. My family enjoyed it.

Loved it!  Only changes I made was that I seasoned the fish with pepper and oregano (in addition to adding the oregano to the tomato mixture).  Added about 3T of tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of white wine to the tomatoes before topping with fish.  Add more oregano and pepper to fish after turning and finish with parmesan cheese to sit for a minute or two.  I cooked about 6 scallops separately seared olive oil and added to the fish and shrimp last minute.  Served over pasta (with sauce) - absolutely delicious!!!

I made changes as suggested. I sauteed the cod in olive oil, margerine and garlic. 3 minutes each side. Added a can of chopped tomatoes with basil , oregano and garlic, added a bit more pepper ,  basil , lemon  and oregano. Added some baby spinach , parmesan cheese and the shrimp.simmered a bit to warm. Good over rice or pasta.  Awesome , easy to make and very good !

Used some Old Bay in place of the Salt. Very good. Will make again.

Although this was very good, we both thought that it would benefit from some cubed feta.  I also added some black pepper and substituted a shake of soy sauce for the salt.  If feta were added, I would not add any add'l salt.

Awesome. Like a few others I made a few adjustments.  Used Tilapia as my fish of choice. Other than that  followed the recipe  to the fullest. Will make again.

Made it last night with canned tomatoes and previously cooked shrimp.  Added shrimp at the very end.  Should have only used 1/2 can of tomatoes - but it tasted great.  Leftovers for lunch!

The kids loved this and we served it with pasta. Next time we will add something to give it a little kick- we all agreed it would be better with a little heat.
