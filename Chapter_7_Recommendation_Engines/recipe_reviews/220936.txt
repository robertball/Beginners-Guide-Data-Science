I  made this for Easter.  Very nice presentation.   I will make again but cut back on the coconut extract. It was a little too much for us.

Really loved the idea and the presentation, but made some changes which we loved !  My family members aren’t buttercream fans so I made the frosting by whipping heavy cream with about 1/4 cup confectioner’s sugar and a tsp of rum extract . . I placed a layer the whipped cream on the first layer , the flaky coconut , then piled on the second layer of cake ,  Frosted all around the op and sides with the whipped cream and pressed more flaked coconut on top and all around the sides . Loved the idea of the green coconut “nest”.  Filled that with jelly beans and placed some yellow and pink marshmallow “ peeps” around the “nest “.  It was a big hit.  Made it twice during Easter week

This is a delicious and quick cake to make. I left the nest and jellybeans off. The coconut makes for an interesting texture and a delightful taste to this box cake. Try it!

A very festive cake, first coconut cake I’ve ever made after my husband raved about  a coconut cake someone made at a dinner.  I added the bunny topper I had for a large candle jar. Delicious!

I use coconut milk throughout - no extracts - and it added richness and more robust flavor.

This recipe was easy to follow. I did have extra icing left over and used 3 nine inch cake pans. I also used a solid coconut oil to grease the pagans with instead of cooking spray. I also improvised the decorations by adding peeps to make it look more festive.
