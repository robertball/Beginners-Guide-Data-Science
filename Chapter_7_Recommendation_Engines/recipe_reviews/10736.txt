These were terrific. I used a mixer to blend all of the ingredients which made for a nice, soft dough. These were very eary to roll out. A suggestion for those whose shapes did not stay...break the dough up into small sections.  Keep the rest of the dough in the fridge until ready to use. Also, while other cookies were baking, I put the unused tray in the fridge to cool off quickly. I learned that if the tray is too hot, it will begin to distort the shape of your cookies even before you put them in the oven. Try it. It really helps to keep the shape.

These cookies were pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  You can't expect amazing cookies unless you're willing to go the extra mile and try one of the other sugar cookie recipes that have 15 different ingredients in them.  I picked these cookies because it's a very simple recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand.  The only thing I didn't like too much was that the dough was really thick and I had a hard time working with it.  Because of the other reviews, I didn't roll out the dough or cut shapes.  I just dropped them and they came out perfectly shaped.  Crispy on the outside with a soft, chewey inside.  Overall, these were good cookies.  Perfect for the house, but if I needed a batch to impress, I would try one of the more elaborate recipes on this site.

Best sugar cookie recipe I've ever made.  The cookies are the perfect combination of crispy and soft.  I won't be looking for a sugar cookie recipe again.

I first made this cookie with vanilla 
and that batch disappeared in 3 days. 
The 18 year old loved them so did my 
husband who is very fussy about cookies. 
For the second batch I used almond extract.
Also, well received. I baked them for 
9 minutes so the cookie is soft (a preference for these
cookie monsters). Thank you for sharing this receipe.

These were wonderful!!!  The kids loved them.  My only suggestion is to increase the amount of flour to 4 or 5 cups.  The dough was too sticky only using 3.

Bad Recipe!  I was looking for a new sugar cookie recipe to try with my son.  This is not it.  Way too sticky.  Impossible to roll out.  I even refrigerated the dough for two days.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored Crisco shortning in the recipe, and refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours.  I didn't roll them, but I put rounded pieces of dough onto cookie sheets and baked them.  I had no problems with them spreading at all..chewy/crispy at the same time.  The whole family loved them...couldn't stop eating them!

I made these today and it was a disaster. The cookies seemed fine untill we rolled them out, and they would stick horribly no matter how much flour I used. They didn't hold the shape of our cut-out and burned before 8 minutes was up. The taste was okay but not impresive. I reread the recipe to see if I left something out, and I don't see anything I did wrong.

I was very disappointed in these cookies.  I intended to use them with my son to roll out and frost.  After two days of chilling the dough in hopes that it would stiffen up enough to roll, we gave up and dropped them.  Unfortunately, they are pretty flavorless, so it was all a complete waste of ingredients and time.

I bake cookies at least twice a week, and these are the BEST sugar cookies I have tasted. Even without frosting or sugar, they are buttery and moist. I have thrown away my other sugar cookie recipes and using only this one from now on!

ummmmmmmmm greate i made them for my girl friend but two suggestions 
1. split the dough into 4 parts then they only need to chill 1 houre and a much easier to roll out
2. i added cinnamin only 1/2 teaspoon but add a 1/4 teaspoon extra sugar to ballance there great i and my siblings and my girl friend loved them thanks
also try putting cooking spray and flour on to som wax paper put the dough on top of one piece and then put the other piece on top its alot easier to roll out you might also try adding a little more flour 1/2 cup of so

There's something wrong with this recipe.  The dough is way to sticky to ever roll out no matter how long you freeze them.  I finally used a spoon and made drop cookies.  They taste fine but do not work as a cut out cookie.  I should have checked the reviews.

I keep this dough in the freezer at all times.  When my grandchildren come to visit, they love making these cookies.  I have never had any problems rolling out the dough or working with this recipe at all.

These tasted good but even after leaving the dough in the freezer overnight it was way to sticky to work with.  I had to dust everything with powdered sugar just to get it not to stick.

Don't waste your time trying to make cut outs!  Average flavor, very sticky dough, even after 2 days in the fridge.  Stuck to the ungreased pan, so I used parchment paper and they came out okay, although they spread a lot.  I'm on a quest to find the perfect cookie cutter recipe, but this one was a waste of time.

These were pretty good sugar cookies. I dropped them instead of rolling them out and they made for very soft cookies. I do feel that they had a bit of plain taste that might be improved by frosting the cookies. Do try these though.

Although these cookies taste great, they are EXTREMELY difficult to work with.  I made them for Christmas, and they spread out so much during baking that they no longer resembled the shapes I had cut them into. Also,the completed cookies are rather fragile and esaily broken.

The dough did not cook well at all. It flattened out and spilled over the cooking sheet while in the oven. I'd give this recipe 0 stars if the rating thing would let me.

I wish I would have read some of the reviews before making these cookies.  The dough was terrible to work with, very sticky, even after refrigerating/freezing.  No possible way to roll them out.  They did make good drop cookies, speading nicely.  But the taste was not good.  I was hoping for a buttery sugary flavor, but I did not get that at all.  I made one pan, tasted them and they were bad.  I sprinkled the next pan with powdered sugar and they were still bad.  I checked the recipe to make sure I did everything right, which I did, then I threw away the rest of the dough.  I would not recommend this recipe.  Sorry.

This recipe was super easy and good. I didnt have the million ingredients that the other recipes called for so i did this one. I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda to see if it would work and it worked fine. I froze the dough for 2 hours then rolled it out and baked them. I dont see how you could mess this recipe up, i am not a cookie baking person and i still got it right! Good recipe

Not sweet enough. I put sugar on top to help, but no good. I had to add extra flour as the batter DID NOT stiffen as recipe said it would. Not good either for trying to make shapes with. Cookies stuck to cutters. Not good at all.

WOW! These are great. I barely have any time to cook but with these it only takes less than 15 minutes anyways. I was amaized. All I did was roll the dough and put it on the sheet. They turned out perfect! Fantastic recipe.

I love this recipe.  I'm vegan, so I had to replace the butter with spread and the eggs with flax seeds, and it still turned out wonderfully.  The cookies did rise quite a bit during baking, but I don't think it affected the cutout shapes too much.  Even if it did -- the taste is worth it! :)

Flat and not shaped the way I cut them.  The taste was not that great either.  I used room temp butter, room temp eggs, and froze the dough before I rolled it. They rose so much that the shape of my Halloween cookies disappeared and then they fell and were as flat as a crepe. I followed the recipe and reviewed if afterwards to see if I had done something incorrectly, but I cannot find anywhere where I goofed.  Good luck with these.

Wonderfully yummy cookies!  The Valentine heart cut-out shape I used was distorted because the dough spread out too much while baking, but the texture and taste of the cookies more than made up for it.

these were great! i loved the buttery taste, but if i make these again, i would try to use 1/2 the butter amount. my cookies did not freeze well, and after a few hours i decided to spoon drop them instead. the guys loved them!

When I made the cookie dough, it became to oily and hard to work with because the oil. It also is very hard to use mini cookie cutters because the dough expands when it cooks. This recipe is good mainly because it doesn't need many materials.

Oh goodness, the batter is really goupey - no way you could roll it for cutting into shapes.  They baked up oddly chewy and really flat.  I tried them for the first time for an Easter get-together and they weren't good enough to bring along.  I double and triple checked all of the ingredients too.

I love this recipe, I always make a double batch separate 2/3 into 2 differant bags and freeze for later use while using the other 1/3 to make sugar cookies. just like most sugar cookie recipes you use more floor to stiffen up the dough to roll and cut into shapes so it can bake without losing it's shape. I have yet to drop them. my step-sons and I have enjoyed many hours of decorating sugar cookies w/ this recipe, Thank you for submitting!

These cookies were delicious and I was able to use them as cut-outs pretty well.  I didn't have baking soda on hand so I substituted 1.5 tsps baking powder and they came out fine.  I definitely recommend them!

This recipe is the WORST. I will never try it again. It's way to sticky and thin. when i baked them they would stick and spread. I tought i goofed and tried it again but ended up throwing the dough away. Everyone in my house said the cookies tasted like POPCORN!! It was a waste of time and money.

These were really easy and tasty.  The only problem is that they spread a little too much so some of my trees and stockings didn't look like trees or stockings much after baking.

This recipe was so fast and easy. I didn't chill the dough before dropping the cookies, so it was a bit sticky, but they taste fantastic. They're sweet and stay soft.

Even after I refrigerated the dough, it became very sticky and difficult to work with.  Especially with cookie cutters which is what the recipe recommends.
