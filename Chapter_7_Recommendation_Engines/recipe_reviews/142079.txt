Good.  Served to company and they all liked it too.  It does not say whether to include the cinnamon sticks and pods in the broth that you use to cook the rice.  I did not but I will try doing do next time to see if it strengthens the flavors.  Also, I advise using more than one onion.  The onion was the best at soaking up the flavors.  The perfect bite had some chicken, some onion and some rice - but there was not really enough onion.  Definitely will make again.  Nice subtle flavors.  Distinct recipe option.  Makes me want to try more Saudi Arabian foods.

I enjoyed this recipe because it was very easy to make and had a unique and subtle flavor. I also like that the rice is partially made with milk - it is a technique I will probably use in other dishes as well. In my area, it was difficult to find cardamom pods, so we used ground cardamom (3 tsp) instead. Not having a basis for comparison, I can't say if it turned out the same, but we thought it turned out very good. It was also an experience to try a Saudi dish as I had never had one before. I will certainly be recommending this recipe to others.

Fragrant and delicous. The milk makes the rice rich, but not heavy.

This was really easy and tasty.  I used my slow cooker and then deboned the chicken and served on side.  It probably would have been even better baked.
