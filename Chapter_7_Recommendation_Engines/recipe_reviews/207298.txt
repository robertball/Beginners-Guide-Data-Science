Excellent holiday recipe!  It defnitely turns out more brown than what the pictures depicts with all the kahluah it calls for but it's so delicious! I tried cutting back to one ounce of kahlua for a better color but it wasn't as tastey.  Garnish with nutmeg to bring out the eggnog flavor!

While not a drink that would become a "regular," this was a perfect, appropriate and festive holiday drink. I noticed both the color and flavor change quite dramatically depending on who mixes the drink and what proportions are used! I found I liked almost equal parts of eggnog and Kahlua with actually NO vodka.  Hubby liked his more as written.  Quite a different flavor and really very good!

Another favorite winter cocktail! This is best with homemade eggnog, heavy on the nutmeg.
