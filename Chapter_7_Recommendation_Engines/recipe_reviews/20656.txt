I decided on the spur of the moment, as I sliced an apple, that I would like a dip to go with it.  I found this one.  The 4 ingredients were things that I always have on hand, and it was oh so delicious and easy to make!  We loved it!  It was NOT sour, and NOT runny.  However, if you are one who likes it thicker, chilling it thickens it up a good bit.  We like it both ways.  I had some left over, and the next day I added a couple tablespoons of peanut butter to it, and that was yummy also and made it thicker.  I will use this one again, and again. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious.  Has a carmel taste to it.  Definitely chill well before serving.  Good with grapes, strawberries, apples, and bananas. Will make this again for sure.

Very good!Very sweet! Best to not use any type of melon.  It thickens a bit if it is chilled.  Overall I would definately make it again and use with apples as a quick snack.

This was a great recipe....as long as you are not watching your calories! Instead of using vanilla, I bought a bottle of Disaronno amaretto, and that's what put it over the top!

The ladies at a party I had loved it.  Definitely use real butter as this helps it set up better as well as making sure it chills for 2-4 hours.  I used 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of real maple syrup.  Great served with grapes, apples, but strawberries was the best.

This is soooo good! I took it to a party and ate the leftovers with a spoon. I used fat free sour cream and light margarine, so that helped a little. It's my favorite fruit dip now.

This dip is insanely delicious! Easy to make too and fast. I really loved it hot / warm. I poured it over freezer chilled apple slices and it was heavenly!

I made this at the last minute, I planned on a cream cheese one, but didn't buy enough cheese. Had ingredients on hand for this and it was very easy and good, I served it chilled.

Tastes like caramel. Don't even notice the sour cream (my fiance hates it but loved this dip... I didn't tell him what was in it) I made this because I had the ingredients on hand and wanted dip for my fruit, however, I think I prefer the more traditional flavored fruit dips.

I whipped this up to go with some apples lastnight when I was packing my husband's lunch. He just texted me raving about it!  It's super quick and easy to make!  I substituted Smart Ballance for butter and I think I used low fat sour cream. I also added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. YUM!

I really liked this. The next time I make it I think I will use less brown sugar. I think it was a little sweet for me but otherwise very easy and tasty. I will be making this again. Thanks

This recipe is pretty good on its own.  I added cinnamon and I split the sour cream with yogurt.  It was a wonderful autumn treat with apples and pears!

I made this dip for my sister-in-law's bridal shower and it disappeared faster then the groom did when he dropped my SIL off. I used the recommended fruit and I doubled the recipe (it was a lot), but the guests kept going back for thirds, fourths, one guest even had fifths!! I have never seen fruit get eaten so fast. Thanks, Tina :)

I wish I had paid attention to how much this recipe yields...it was WAY more than I needed for a fruit tray.  I will make this again, but will definitely halve the recipe. Excellent with strawberries, grapes & apples.

This is very good.  I have been to many of baby showers, wedding showers, and most of the fruit dip is marsmallow and cream cheese...  This is so yummy and goes great with strawberries!  It took about 3 min for me to whip this up for my daughters 1st birthday party!  Totally last min.  Everyone liked it!

Five stars for taste and convenience, but only 3 stars of consistency, so I'm giving this one a four-star rating.  I didn't like how runny the dip was.

Pretty darn good. Lovely slightly sour, sweet taste that goes really well with nearly any fruit we tried with it. Gets perfectly creamy after chilling in the fridge for a few hours. Mmmm!

I made this for thanksgiving. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because it was Thanksgiving and we couldn't get to the store! It turned out pretty tasty, I just wish the consistancy was maybe a little thicker. I also added pecans to the top.

I made this fruit dip because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I agree with PP that it would not work with melon...and maybe not with pineapple.  I used it with strawberries.  My first impression was "hmmmm creamy caramel."  I thought it would be best on apples.  After eating about 10 strawberries before my guests had arrived, I decided that it was really good on strawberries as well....maybe grapes too.

Anyway, I give it 4 stars because it is not quite as versatile as other fruit dips, but for a nice change of pace and a little something different, it is quite delicious!

Very good, I found it delicious with apples, bananas, and green grapes.  It is definitely better cold.  I like it much more if you add a spoonful or two of creamy peanut butter.

This was so delicious and so easy.  I needed a "small" dessert to take to a party and I brought this with some gingersnaps I  had made to use as dippers. It was a big hit. It did need to chill to thicken as others have written.

This is delicious! I actually used it for a dessert-drizzled over home grown strawberries in a champagne flute. I have also made it with a few teaspoons of triple sec  instead of the vanilla-yummy-garnish with fresh mint-it's impressive and SO easy!

This recipe is simple and delicious. I served it at a party this past weekend and everyone enjoyed it. I served it chilled and it thickened up quite a bit after sitting in the fridge about 4 hours. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this very easy dip and added fresh, seedless red and green grapes and refigerated them overnight. I served this cold as an "appetizer" at an anniversary brunch for my parents. It was fabulous!! Give it a try!!

Excellent sweet rich caramel-ly dip! This was very thin and runny when warm, but still delicious. I served this with grapes but I think it would be awesome with any fruit and probably would be great drizzled over cake, brownies, or ice cream too. It tasted like Kraft caramels candy with a little twangy aftertaste (I guess that is the sour cream's flavor). YUM! Thanks Tina!

"It's finger linkin' good", says my daughter.  She found this recipe, and we just made it this morning.  I served it cold.  Tasteless red coloring was added.  Next time she wants blue :-)  Thanks for the recipe, Tina!

Really good and easy to make.......Even though I made the mistake of using tablespoons instead of teaspoons with the vanilla extract. Will make again-next time I'll pay more attention and I'm sure it will still be delicious.

I love this dip..but I am living in Brazil and they don't have sour cream here :( so sad cause i love it! so i use plain yogurt instead.   its a lot more runny but I guess if you don't have sour cream it works well. I think if you mix the yogurt with some kind of cream or chantilly it can thicken the mixture. I am trying to find a way to thicken it. It just happens that the yogurt is way runnier in Brazil than the US, so its almost like water. I tried to heat it a little longer and let it sit over nght but it didn't help :(...

This is a good dip if your wanting sweet. I did add 2 tblsp. of peanut butter after tasting the recipe as written. Maybe cut back on the brown sugar.

love it. simple and uses every day items.  I've had to make it several time these past few weeks.  my kids LOVE it and eat so many more apples this way.  They like it warm or chilled with walnuts sprinkled on top. I've also used yogurt when out of sour cream and just as good.

This fruit dip was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and served it cold for Christmas breakfast. It was great on the mixture of fruits we had that day. I was a little alarmed at how much it made (how much I had left!) until I discovered that it's also *amazing* on oatmeal! Yum!

Love! I was craving fruit dip for my apples after seeing apple dip on the homepage today. I didn't have cream cheese on hand so I was so excited to find this recipe using sour cream as the base. It's very rich.

I'm bringing a fruit dip to a recognition event for work next week, so I'm trying out dips.  Bf wasn't too impressed wtih this one.  He said "If I wanted a dip, I'd just grab some caramel."  I think he thought it was too runny--didn't understand it thickens as it cools and won't be runny after being in the fridge.  I liked it, especially with apples.  I don't know if I'll bring this one, but it was a nice dip.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good dip with ingredients you always have on hand. I added crushed walnuts which was nice with pineapple. Serve chilled. Second day mixed with whipped cream as banana pancake topping. Yummmmy.

This is really good! I managed to let it cool for about an hour before I dug into it. Another hour would stiffen it up a bit, but...I wonder if maybe increasing the sugar and butter ratio (or decreasing the sour cream) would help? Or maybe go ahead and boil the sugar/butter mixture for a few minutes before adding the sour cream and vanilla?
Anyway..delicious on apples, going to try strawberries, and already brewing up some ideas for other uses for this. Yum! Thank you.

Delicious, quick, and simple.  I decided on a whim that I wanted a fruit dip, and so I did a search for one without cream cheese since I didn't have any on hand, and this was just the ticket.  We ate it with grapes and strawberries and loved it.

I liked this recipe.  It was very simple easy to create and I already had all of the ingredients.  I scaled the serving size down to 3 and it was enough for me and my three kids for a quick snack with lots ready for tomorrow's dinner with family. We were too eager to wait for it to thicken up and it was smoother than we are use to but from reading the other reviews, I was prepared for it.  Still, it was fabulous.  Thanks Tina!

The flavour was really yummy. I only gave it 4 stars because it did not thicken up for me so was much more a sauce than a dip.

Wonderful fruit dip.  It was just a little too sweet for me though.  I did chill it for about 3 hours because it seemed too thin at first.  It really thickened up though in the fridge and was great.

Excellent! quick and easy dip- I had all the ingredients on hand. I only had 30 min to chill it in the fridge, and it thickened right up. Delicious!! I used grapes, apples, watermelon, pineapple, strawberries. Everyone asked for the recipe!

This is great with cake! I don't really care for it too much with fruit. But it is good. I just want to find out what I should use this with. Definately better with apples than any other fruit.

I made this on a whim, because it looked fast and easy.  I wasn't too sure about what the end result would be, given the ingredients, but who knew such an odd combination would blend together to form such a delicious, caramel flavor.   I followed the directions exactly as written, and it was perfect.  It was a huge success and there was none left over after the event...always the mark of a culinary triumph.  Thanks.

I've made this many times with my culinary arts students.  We've played with the recipe and we have developed a version of this we like more.  We cut the sugar by about a third.  Then when it's all made, we fold in freshly whipped cream until it forms soft peaks.  We find lightening it up makes it much more enjoyable.

This was delicious.  However, I did change it up a bit.  I added in a large pinch of salt, cooked the butter/brown sugar mixture until it was almost smooth (so more like caramel), and added in the whole quart container of sour cream.  I garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Over time, it thickened nicely.  It was a huge hit at the party we attended.  We served it with pretzel sticks since our apples were all a bit bruised and not good enough for a party.

I would've given it two or three stars, but I couldn't even eat it! The caramel was way too sweet and the sour cream smell was overwhelming. The first time I made it I used white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar, and disliked it. The second time I used brown sugar without vanilla extract, and it wasn't good either. The third time I followed the recipe precisely and got the worst results of all.

I needed a quick fruit dip.  I used a cup of sour cream and added about a quarter cup of brown sugar and then added a little vanilla.  It was not thick, but the flavor was delicious.  I just couldn't understand the use of the butter, thought it would be greasy, so I left it out.  Possibly with the butter, it would have been a thicker consistency.

Very easy to make. I served it cold. It was extremely sweet.

So delicious and a great unique taste.  People can't put their finger on why it tastes so delicious!  Perfect especially as it doesn't call for Marshmallow Fluff which I never have in my cupboard if I am making last minute.

Made this for a get together and it was well-received.  Did have some left over, but we had a LOT of food.  The next morning, I used a couple of tablespoons in a fruit salad of strawberries, grapes, and bananas we had for breakfast and it was wonderful!  Edit?

I always get compliments when I make this. I usually just play around with the ratios and tailor it to my taste. I think there is too much of butter and sugar as many of the other reviewers have written.
