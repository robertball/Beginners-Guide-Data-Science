This recipe was awful.  I think the measurements are wrong.  Be careful making this.  It lists 1 1/2 cups of water, and then again 1 cup of water.  2 1/2 cups of water for 6 cups of flour does not make a stiff dough, it was almost like thick cake batter.  Also, it lists sugar, 2 separate places in the recipe, however when you add the ingredients, it does not specify where the 2nd sugar ingredient goes.  I would love to have a recipe similar to this, one that works. Thanks.

There is something wrong with this recipe.  I tried it and it looked ok but when I baked them they would not stay together they crumbled.  I think 1 1/2 cups of water would do better if it were milk instead which I am going to try instead.

It definately lacks work.

This recipe would be good if the ingredient list amounts were correct. To much liquid and to much yeast. The owner of this recipe needs to correct the amounts. All you have to do is compare it to other yeast roll recipes and you can see where it is not likely to work.

I made these ahead for Thanksgiving this year.  They were beautiful and tasty.  A bit salty for my taste however.  (I am on a low sodiun diet and so any salt might be "salty" to my taste.)

I love this recipe, if you follow the directions to the letter, these will be the best rolls you have ever eaten... I melt cinnamon and butter and brush on told when baked then freeze them in seperate bags, packaged for a meal. They are the best.

So easy and so very tasty. If you enjoy soft, yeasty bread, you'll find these wonderful. They make great round buns. I tried twisting them for a different shape, but they sprung back to the traditional posture.  split my batch into two  plastic bags, which provided plenty for 4 at two different meals. Next batch, I'm going to make cinnamon rolls, adding spice and sugar when forming the balls  and a bit of icing atop after baking.

This recipe was very easy.  I read the reviews and due to the reviews I made some changes.  I made knot shape like rolls and they actually were more appealing than the round rolls.    The taste was a little yeasty and when fresh and hot from the oven they were good.  Once cooling for 10 minutes they became almost like day old bread.  You could pop in the microwave for a quick heat and eat immediately and it would be good again.  For starters I changed the servings to 8.  Due to so many noting there was too much water I reduced the water to 1/2 cup to melt with the butter and 1/2 cup to proof the yeast.  I ended up having to add 1/4 cup flour to get a firm dough that wasn't sticky.  After 20 hours in the fridge the dough looked as if it had already been baked, so I pulled it out and proceeded with shaping and baking.  I used about 2 ounces of dough per knot shaped roll.  I have never seen a recipe use self rising flour for a yeast dough, I think I will experiment with an all-purpose or bread dough next time.

Easy it is. I prefer little tight breads than big fluffy ones. Actually, the batch that I took out of my freezer + 24 hours of fridge turned out much much better! Hm, I add 1 star (going from 2 to 3)
