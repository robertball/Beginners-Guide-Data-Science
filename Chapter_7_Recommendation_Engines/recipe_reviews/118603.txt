I had to substitute the cheese, but did everything else the same.  It was great.  I'm keeping this in my recipe box.  Thanks!

I think this is a 4-star, my husband demands 5...  He LOVED it.  I enjoyed it.  There's a lot of flavor in this recipe, even with the asiago cheese taken down to ~2 c.  One reviewer suggested increasing the ranch (we used Kraft FF Ranch) but next time I will use less than a full cup.  It was very saucy.  Maybe I'll use more noodles (Whole wheat!) next time, but it'll need a larger casserole dish.  Really liked the crunchy bread crumbs on top, too!

I had leftover asiago cheese from lasagna, so I did a search and found this recipe.  I figured my husband and I would be eating it for the next week because our kids can be VERY picky.  I was shocked when they went back for THIRDS!  I used regular ranch instead of garlic ranch and also used heavy cream (to get it out of the fridge after another baking project) but otherwise pretty much followed it.  Very yummy!!!

I just made this dish and while it was good, I would use less asiago cheese next time.  Unless you're wild for asiago, it's just a bit strong.  I'd say 2 1/2 cups, maybe only 2.  And increase the Ranch a bit to compensate.  Maybe even substitute some of the asiago with another cheese, I don't know how mozzarella would do.  Oh, and I used Italian bread crumbs and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top.  Good stuff.  Just way too tart.

I thought this was really good and tastey, but it didn't go over well at the party I went to.  I think it was a bit dry by the time it was served.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!  My husband, kids and I all loved it.

I couldn't find Garlic Ranch so I just used the regular and it was the best mac & cheese I have ever had.  Yum!
