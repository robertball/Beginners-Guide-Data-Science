Will be making this for Thanksgiving!   Very good and easy...I very rarely bake and I even screwed up the topping.  I used room temp butter and it even though the topping didn't come out right, it was still yummy!  I did put some coconut in the topping and it was good.  Been raiding the fridge for it the last 2 nights!  :)

This was YUMMY and used my leftover cranberry sauce also.  Is best when hot out of the oven.

This is an interesting recipe.  It is easy to assemble and I liked the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand.  I was intrigued with the combination of  red apples,  pineapple and cranberry sauce and could not phantom what the  ending taste would be. It tasted tart, sweet, and sour and with the toping it became crunchy.  I debated on peeling the apples but am glad that I did not.  I served this as a side for breakfast.  It would make a beautiful and festive addition to any brunch buffet, holiday meal or with the addition of ice cream it would make a tasty dessert. Thanks Eleanor Johnson for sharing and for AR Member Don for nominating this recipe as the AR Recipe Group selection.

Very good, fast and easy. I looked for a way to use up leftover cranberry sauce and since I had everything needed for this recipe, decided to try it.  Wow.  I will make it even when I don't have leftover cranberry sauce.

Used this recipe as a guide to use up some pineapple and cranberry sauce I had left over from another recipe.  Overall, I think I followed it pretty much as written (scaled to half) but I didn't actually measure the pineapple and cranberry.  I would make it again but maybe mix the pineapple and cranberry sauce before pouring over the apples to help break up the cranberry sauce and make it more spreadable.  I think coconut would be a good addition too!

I liked this alot, and my husband and teenage son loved it.  Sort up like Apple crisp, but with a tang from the cranberries.  Will make again!

I thought it was okay, but my three daughters didn't care for the combination of apples/pineapple/cranberry together.  They thought it tasted too sweet, even though no sugar was added to the fruits.  I used Granny Smith apples.

Really like this recipe.  I added some walnut as I forgot to add them to my cranberry sauce.

I would have just given this three stars. The bottom part is good, but the crumble part doesn't have nearly enough liquid. Even though I added a few tablespoons of water, it was still very dry and fell apart. But my family liked this enough for me to up my rating to four stars. If I'd make it again though, I'd use a topping from a different recipe.

I enjoyed the fruit medley, it was a very interesting and tasty mixture. The crumble seemed a little dry and I wanted more crumble. I would do 1 1/2 batches of crumble and add a little more butter for texture and to help it hold together

Recipe Group selection of 9/9/12.  I wasn't sure about this, but I liked it.  I think it would be nice after a heavy holiday meal.  Thanks Eleanor!

Made for Recipe Group.  I cut the recipe in half and followed the directions as stated, used granny smith apples as the ingredient list did not specify which kind to use.  We found this to be too sweet for our taste.  You definitely need to eat it warm; leftovers did not reheat well.  Thanks for sharing a new recipe to try, Eleanor Johnson.

Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED this! I used a smalish, round casserole dish instead of the size dish that was specifierd, so I did have some topping leftover, but would just 1/2 that next time. I used 2 nice sized Gala apples (peeled), 1-8oz. can crushed pineapple (drained), and 1 can (14oz.) whole berry cranberry sauce. Really enjoyed the sweet/tart combo! The crushed pineapple was as noticeable as I had hoped, so next time I would use pineapple tidbits instead. Served warm w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top...YUM! All in all, a great, easy fall dessert that I will be making again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)
