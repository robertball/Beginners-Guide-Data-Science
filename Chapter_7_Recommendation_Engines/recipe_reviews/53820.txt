I personally thought this dip was just fine, but I just got back from a party where it was a HIT! I got SO many compliments on it! At the end there was some left and someone took a fork and just finished it off! It is so easy to make, very inexpensive, and obviously very popular! Like some other reviewers, I just added the dressing until the consistency looked right. I'm sure that the quality of the Caesar Dressing really impacts the quality of the final product. I just used Kraft, but the dressing does have a starring role, so if you are picky about your Caesar Dressing, then be sure to use your favorite kind. I think this would also be really good with tuna or chicken in it as more of a main dish salad for greens or sandwiches.

Very good!  A nice complement to more traditional appetizers.  My only advice is to be sure to squeeze out all tomato juice (so as to not turn the dip pink).  Also, definitely make the day of your event.  Yum!

I made this for my guests to snack on before dinner b/c it didn't sound "heavy".  The first thing my husband said was "wow, this is nice & light" ~
Perfect :)  
I served it with club crackers & I will add the dressing a little at a time next time until I get the consistency I prefer.  I am thinking the amount will depend on the type of dressing used.  Thank you for the recipe - I will make this again.

I didn't have already made Caesar dressing but I did have Johnny's Caesar Garlic Bread dry mix, so I threw in about a tablespoon of that in a half cup of nonfat plain yogurt. Worked out great! Super yummy. I think next time, I'll add finely chopped cucumber and a little lemon juice.

This was an awesome dip! I followed other reviewer suggestions and used kalamata olives for more Greek authenticiy and added chopped cucumber as well. Used Gardini's caesar dressing. I think it needs more than 25 min in the refrigerator...easily make ahead several hours. This is already a new favorite!

This is fantastic! I only had a 4 ounce package of garlic and herb feta cheese and I doubled up on the tomatoes(because they were small). I didn't measure out the dressing, I just added it until the dip was the consistency I wanted. I wasn't sure about the saltines, but this dip really is better with them. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for our annual Mother's Day picnic and served it with Stacey's Simply Naked Pita Chips (from Costco).  I also, as another rater noted, added the dressing until I got the desired consistency.  I included chopped cucumber to round it out!  If you love feta, you'll love this!

I served this as an appetizer for a work holiday party with a lot of picky eaters and children all under the age of 6.   My coworkers stood in a line around the dip and within twenty minutes the dip was completley finished.  At work the next day I had at least six people ask me for the recipe saying that it was amazing.  I doubled the recipe and served the dip with sliced celery and quarted pita bread.  This was such a hit!

Fantastic! We ate this on townhouse crackers and frresh bread. It was so good a couple people just ate it with a  fork! I can't wait to have this again.

ETA: It's even better with kalamata olives!

I made this using kalamata olives instead of regular black olives.  I also included some chicken and served it with pita chips. I added a scoop of the lefteover dip to a nice green salad and it was wonderful too.

Holy Macaroni!  This is delicious!!!!  I LOVE, LOVE feta cheese but I wasn't aware of the many different uses for it.  I stumbled upon this recipe and had to try it. I do agree with other reviewers that the consistency is up to the consumer of this recipe.  I bought a store brand of Caesar dressing which seems to be a bit heavier.  Next time, I'll try Newman's Caesar. Will definitely make this again... and again! Thxs for this recipe MOM2ANGELS!

I made this for a small dinner party and everyone liked it but I didn't think it was that great.  It was very salty.  I cut pita bread into small triangular slices to serve with the dip.  I might try this again but I will get reduced fat feta (less salt) and perhaps a fat free caesar dressing as well.

This recipe was so simple! I only found 7 ounces of feta  cheese but it had tomato and basil mixed in.  I added the Caeser dressing to desired consistency and I forgot to put the tomatoes in.  It tasted wonderful and everybody at the shower raved over it. I will make again and I'll remember to add the tomatoes next time.  Goes really well with Triscuits.

I made this for my book club and everyone wanted the recipe! They loved it!  The only alteration I made was using Lite Creamy Greek Salad Dressing instead of Cesaer and fat-free feta instead of regular. Tasted exactly like Greek Salad! Fantastic! I may add some green pepper next time... or even chopped cuke. It's the kind of dip you can play around with and it will still be delicious! Thanks!!

This was great!! 8 oz. feta is too much in proportion to other ingredients. More tomato and black olives- PERFECTION.  It was very appreciated at a beach bonfire I brought it to.  I will make it again but try my own caesar dressing.  The store bought tasted  "ok" and yogurt based so it had merit nutritionally.

One word..AMAZING! I made this for a family dinner..6 of us and had to double the recipe even though it said for 8 servings. Maybe it was so good it went fast! 2 people didn't even like Feta cheese but loved this! One of my favorite dips. I served it with baked pita chips and french bread.

I don't care for olives, but I used them anyway, and I can't imagine this recipe without them.  I also added extra tomato.  This was fantastic!  Very addictive.  The family loved it.  I will prepare it again.

Absolutely delicious! I made it as written except I used    4 oz instead of 8 oz of feta cheese. Just because that's what I had on hand. I tasted it after I made it. But once it was chilled it took it up a notch. Next time I will add less onion.  If you enjoy strong, rich, flavors this recipe is for you.

I accidentally bought lite dressing and used Kalmatta olives as others suggested. Usually when I make a dip or spread for a family party it's gone within a few minutes of its arrival. My family ate it and enjoyed it but it was definitely not a favorite, mot bad, just not great.

This dip is the best!!! It is super easy to throw together and impresses everyone. I don't think you can go wrong with Feta cheese. I did use tomato basil flavored feta, but I am sure unflavored would still be good.

Very easy dip & tasty too. I served it with home baked pita chips. I used less cheese (~6oz instead of 8) & dressing (~1/4C instead of 1/2-used Newman's Own), added diced red onion, garlic, fresh oregano.
Will make this again & also use over lettuces for a real Greek salad:-)

I made this dip for a party and it was a hit.  My husband didn't like the saltine crackers with it though, next time I will use pita chips or baked tortillas.  Out of 10 people, 5 asked for the recipe.  I also used a little more feta cheese, can never have enough feta!
