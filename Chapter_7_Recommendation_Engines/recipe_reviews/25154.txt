I just made a simple green salad with the dressing and it was FABULOUS!  Even my boyfriend who hates curry powder loved it.  I substituted 2 tablespoons additional water in place of 2 TBS of the oil to cut a few calories.  I didn't miss the extra oil!

I made this for dinner the other night and it was a big hit with my husband and myself.  I added some tomatoes and some shrimpmeat - I couldn't get the thick bacon so I used regular bacon, crumbled into the salad.  Excellent.

Way yummy! I used turkey bacon for lower fat and the results were just as tasty. Thanks for the great recipe

We aren't crazy about curry to begin with, but I still thought this salad was very good.  My husband didn't like it at all just because of his curry hang-up!

This salad was a hit at my boyfriend's birthday party.  Since he is vegetarian, I substituted the bacon with tempeh "fakin' bacon" which tastes closer to the real thing than any vegi-meat around and has a nice crunchy consistancy.  I also added cherry tomatoes.  Yummy...  I will be making it again.

So yummy!  I am not a big curry fan, but my husband is and I tried this one out for him.  Even I thought it was wonderful.  I think I will add cherry tomatoes nextime for a little color and texture.

I liked it, but then, I like vinaigrettes.  My husband didn't think much of it, he likes creamy dressings.  Even the curry didn't save it for him.  We both are curry lovers.

The first time I made this, I used just the  spinach with the dressing and added sliced almonds and raisins. Perhaps it was because the bacon wasn't used to add sweetness and fat, but I found the dressing a bit too tart for me. With the leftover dressing, however, I whisked in some honey and drizzled this over greens topped with garam masala-dusted chicken breast, sliced almonds, avocado, and cucumber. This I really liked! Thank you for submitting.

I made this salad for dinner tonight and it was wonderful. One guest went back for seconds. I would have too if there had been enough. 8) I decreased the oil just a little bit and added two additional teaspons of curry as well as onions, sunflower seeds and cherry tomatos. I will be making this often. Thanks for posting this great recipe.

This salad is great. 
I've made this salad maybe 15 times. I usually add some apples, cherry tomatoes, and green onion, shredded mozz cheese, and chicken breast to make it a great standalone meal.

fantastic.  I added two hard boiled eggs, one green onion, and plum tomatoes, used only 3 T of oil and turkey bacon.  It felt plenty oily for me.

I made this a week later for guests and just did the dressing with a spinach and cherry tomato salad.  It was wonderful and the guests all had seconds.

I made this exactly as the recipe dictated and thought it turned out excellent. A good idea for when you want the nutrition of raw spinach and a bit of zip with your meal.

A nice dressing as a change from the ordinary, but it had a very strong curry flavour.  I think I would cut back on the curry powder next time.  Was cooking for a vegetarian so subbed hard boiled eggs for the bacon.

This is a very tasty salad dressing and I will make it again.  My son kept saying how much he liked it, which is strange to hear from him.  Thank you for a good tasting recipe.

I did not love this. The vinaigrette had too much oil and tasted very sour. I wouldn't make again.

This was the first time I've made this salad, and I brought it over to a friend's BBQ.  It was a big hit; even the non-salad eater of the group was eating the last bits straight out of the serving bowl!  After reading the reviews, I did make a few alterations.  I added two more tablespoons of curry, although I think next time I'll just add one extra -- it had quite a kick tonight!  I also sautéed the mushrooms and used regular bacon as that was what I had on hand.  We wrapped the pre- cooked bacon and mushrooms in foil right before we were ready to eat and threw it on the BBQ to warm up before tossing them into the salad, and it was awesome!

I had started making a different salad and had tomatoes, spinach, red onion, mushrooms, hard boiled eggs but no bacon. This dressing sounded fantastic and it was. Everyone loved it. I don't think it matters much what you put it on. If you like curry, you will like this.

I loved the smell of the curry roasting. I was worried the curry was going go overwhelm the salad, but it was just right! Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and just cooked turkey bacon in the microwave and just crumbled that in. Added chick peas (so good!) and tomatoes. Served to grandparents and children, everyone liked it!
