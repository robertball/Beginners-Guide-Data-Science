Very easy to make.  Almost as good as grandma made.  Possibly the best crust I've ever tasted, and definitely the best crust I've ever made!

This pie turned out amazing, my whole family couldn't get enough of it and they are pumpkin pie fanatics!  I only used a 28 ounce can of pumpkin puree and it still turned out great and there was enough filling for 3 pies (9 inch crusts).  This is THE best pumpkin pie recipe ever!

I really enjoyed this pie! The filling wasn't too sweet and the crust was perfect.
