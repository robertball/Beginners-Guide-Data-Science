Used chick peas instead of white beans because that's all I had. Will make again, definitely with the chick peas!

This is an attractive, healthy salad that contains complete protein for a vegetarian meal. I think it will be even better tomorrow, when the flavours have had time to blend more. thanks!

This salad was really tasty.  I had some bulgur wheat sitting in my cabinet unused, so I decided this was the recipe to try it with.  I didn't have white beans so I substituted with butter beans.  It was fine.  Also used a whole red sweet pepper instead of half a yellow one.  And definitely needed some chopped fresh avocado.  Made a great addition to this salad.  Maybe for some extra Mediterranean flair next time I'd also chop up some kalamata olives to add a little punch.  Overall a great recipe.  My husband, who gave up meat entirely for Lent, couldn't stop raving about it.  This one's a keeper.

I found this recipe after receiving tons of parsley in my CSA veggie box.  It was delicious and easy!  I ended up adding 1 whole red bell pepper, rather than 1/2 a yellow, and lots of small heirloom tomatoes instead of 1 large tomato.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I made it again for two other families and they both asked for the recipe.  I enjoyed this recipe much more than traditional Lebonese tabbouleh because there is more too it than parsley!

Loved it! Used quinoa instead of bulgar wheat, and 1/2 parsley 1/2 mint, with a little cucumber added, red onion, and red bell pepper instead. Next time I'll probably use all mint.

Really nice tabbouleh recipe. I reduced the bulgur by a 1/3, added extra parsley about 1/3 cup more,  and another lemon.

Amazing taste! I substituted yellow pepper for red pepper, baby spinach for frozen spinach and since I didn't have tomato, I felt like I needed another veggie, so I added snow peas. Delicious, I'll definitely make this again.

This had really good flavor.  Unless your tomato is huge, you'll want to use more than one.  Next time I will add another half cup (at least) of bulgar as well.

I like this recipe because it has more than just the regular parsley and bulgur. This recipe just screams chick peas to me instead of the white bean. So I used them.  Not a fan of tomatoes in the winter. So I didn't use any. This salad is one of those that is actually better if made a day in advance.

Tastes so fresh.  Great salad.  Tasty way to get bulgar in your diet.  Used chickpeas and the second time I mad it I added a chopped cucumber I wanted to use up.

This was okay, but I found the parsley overwhelming (I realize that's how Tabbouleh is supposed to be, so I guess I'm not a big fan of parsley). The second time I made it, I doubled the spinach and garlic and halved the parsley and that did the trick for us. This is a great summer meal, nice and light. Tasted great the next day in my lunch, too!

Really good, but made some modifications.  Used quinoa cooked in veggie broth instead of bulgur.  Added mint and cucumber as well.  Not sure if I would add the beans next time -- the texture didn't go with the dish.

This was sooo delicious.  I used the red pepper also asthe store did not have single yellow peppers.   I also used purple onion because I had it left over and had only large yellow onions.  I also used grape tomatoes because they would be riper.  I had real Arabic tabbouleh in Qatar and this recipe comes pretty close to what I had (without the beans).  Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this twist on Tabbouleh. I'm not sure mine is even Tabbouleh anymore, heh.  It is a very forgiving recipe: no spinach - ok. Roasted pepper instead of fresh? Even better. Roasted garlic? fine. 1/2 the parsley? No problem. 

Instead of putting any salt in, I added about 1/2 cup of marinated green/black olive salad (muffeletta-style), which included some pickled veggies too.  RaeAnne serves her olives as garnish, but now I prefer them chopped and incorporated.

It is better if you make it the day before, so the flavors have time to meld.

I omitted the parsley, used 2 green onions instead of a small onion and threw in chick peas. I served it in whole wheat pitas spread with vegetable hummus. Absolutely delicious!

I'm amused that some reviewers said they cut the bulgur and some said they added more.  To each their own, I guess.  I cut mine by about a third.  This is a pretty good recipe.  I thought it was heavy on the salt, though, and I'm a fan of salt.

What a bright, beautiful, delicious salad! The colors are striking, and the flavor is out of this world. I'd bet it's pretty forgiving too, if you wanted to sub in whatever veggies you have on hand. We loved it!

This is a wonderful salad, light healthy and full of flavor.  The only changes I made were as follows:  I used a box of middle east toubouli salad mix.  My local grocer didn't have bulger wheat.   I followed the instructions on the box and added all the other ingredients.  I had yellow and red peppers on hand and used both.  I also used cherry tomatoes because we prefer them.  Added another garlic clove and used chick peas in place of cannellini.  They add a nice firm texture to the salad.

My family loves this.  It tastes so fresh and good.  I had to sub cilantro for the parsley which was excellent, which I cut in about half as the cilantro flavor is stronger than parsley.

This Tabbouleh recipe is simply amazing.  The flavors are all there and it is extremely satisfying.  We made a mean out of it with a little flat bread toasted and served with olive oil.  The vegetables are raw and crisp, the olive oil and lemon juice give you that perfect Mediterranean zing of flavor and yet it is so simple and healthy.

My wife is asking me to make this once a week, who would have thought that she would be begging for more bulgur and vegetables.  This is going to be on our frequently made recipe list I am sure.

Thanks for sharing.

Really enjoyed this, left out the spinach but added lots of cucumber and extra lemon.
