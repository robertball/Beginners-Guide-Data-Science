I'm Mexican and I grew up drinking this delicious aguas frescas.My whole fam. loved this drink, definately we'll make it again during the summer. The possibilitys are endless instead of strawberries you can use cantaloupe,watermelon, papayas etc,. even mangos. Yummy! My only changes: Didn't have time to put it in the refrigerator and wait 4 hrs. so I just put it in the blender and made it in two batches, used Splenda insted of reg. sugar and didn't strained like the recipe states.But I'm sure the original recipe is as delicious with no changes. It's just my personal preference. Thanks for sumitting your recipe!

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, just flavored water.  However, it's really refreshing and definitely needs to sit overnight to develop the flavor.

This is sooo good. I've seen these drinks in big pitchers in Mexico but been afraid to order due to not wanting to drink the water. It was very easy to make. Very light, refreshing I didn't change a thing. Will definetly make again. Thanks!

Very pretty and refreshing alternative to lemonade and perfect for the upcoming strawberry and summer season.  Hubs especially appreciated this to grab from the fridge rather than his usuall Fresca. Since I don't drink sugary drinks I'd be curious to try this with a sugar substitute to see how it compares.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was just what I was looking for! I love this stuff.  I can't wait to make it again! Good with a splash of club soda, too, if you want it a little fizzy.

I thoroughly enjoyed this. To me this was very light, refreshing. Not sweet or tart. Most bottled waters with the essence of fruit flavors are really tart and don't actually have very good flavor. This did for me. I think after I sliced up all the strawberries it worked out of 2 1 pound containers about 4 1/2 to 5 cups of strawberries, so I used them all in this. You could probably make it sweeter in the step that you add the 7 cups of water but I didn't. We enjoyed. Thank you soo much.

I messed up on the cup count for water and ended up using about half the amount. I cut the sugar by one half. I can see that it would be a perfect refreshing drink on a hot day and even with half the water it was amazing. Will be maing this again tomorrow. I didn't bother to slice the fruit since my blender was adequate for the job of pureeing.I also plan to use this method with the abundnace of watermelon that I have. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my, this recipe is a must try!   I've tried making fruit water without much success and clearly letting it sit long enough is the key.   

What a refreshing treat on a hot summer day and when strawberries are in season.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2c, as others mentioned and it was sweet enough for our taste.   I was getting impatient at how long it took to strain so I just poured the remaining 7 cups water through the strainer to get every last strawberry flavoured morsel.  There was only a small spoonful of seeds left, so I definitely recommend straining it to get that wonderful smooth taste.

Yes, my family makes this recipe and we like it. At first glance you can think this is just a little flavored water, but aqua de fresa is rich and delicious. We put mint leaves and lime juice in the drink.

This was okay. I don't think I'll spend all that time cutting the fruit for this though.  Good, but not that good.

Delicious and refreshing!!  I made this the night before our party (for Cinco de Mayo) - using 1/2 the sugar (1/2 cup) - and it was fabulous!  I wouldn't have thought it would taste so "strawberry-y" but it did after it was in the refrigerator overnight. The day of our party, I added in the remaining water and some mint (decided to leave out the lime) as well as slices of strawberries and all of us RAVED about this light and refreshing drink!  Personally, I thought the 1/2 cup of sugar to 4 cups strawberries was plenty sweet and so did several other people but a couple of my friends (who tend to like foods sweeter), added in more sugar at the table.  I blended mine and served it without straining it.  I love the pieces (though honestly, there were hardly any pieces since our blender does a great job at blending everything).  It turned out frothy and sort of thick which was nice.  I pictured water with chunks of strawberries, no flavor and disappointment but it was completely the opposite!!  I will be making this recipe for my children on a regular basis!

This was a nice, refreshing drink for a Mexican-themed birthday party.  It went fast.  The only downside is that it takes so many strawberries, and really doesn't make all that many servings.

I love this water, my mother in law makes it all the time.  She usually leaves the seeds in hers though, I like it without them much better.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

My boyfriend is obsessed with strawberries, so I made this for us last night (scaled down to two servings since I had less than a full package of fresh strawberries left in the fridge) and I have to agree that it is a very light, refreshing, and delicious beverage. I scaled back on the sugar a little bit and it was still great! I think one of the things that makes it so good is that is not sickingly sweet as a lot of store bought juices are (where you are killing 120 calories for an 8oz serving, just like a soda) but not uncomfortably bland either, like some of the flavored waters you purchase at the store and feel kind of uncomfortable drinking because they're really not sweet enough. I didn't realize making a fresh, GOOD, light juice was so easy. We will definitely use this recipe again! I didn't blend everything up completely either as my boyfriend enjoys the strawberry "pulp" a lot. The only thing I noticed was that after I blended everything up, there was a foam on top, which is a little bit annoying if you're not drinking it through a straw, but I believe it can easily be skimmed off with a spoon. Thanks so much Olivia!

Loved it! I had some beautiful, perfectly sweet and ripe strawberries, and a whole cup of sugar seemed like a lot, so I used a half cup - it was perfect!  Nice light strawberry flavor, not too sweet.  I like this better than lemonade, so I'll be making it often this summer.  Thanks Olivia!

My pitcher would only hold 7 cups of water, which still worked well, and gave it  more intensity.  It is rather sweet, so one could use 3/4 c. sugar, depending on the quality & sweetness of the fruit. Another reviewer said you could make this with other fruits, so I also tried this with honeydew,  and it was marvelous!

My family really liked this. The only thing that I thought it could be is a little sweeter. I don't know if it was the sugar stuck to the bottom of the bowl when I put it into the blender or if I would add a little more sugar at the end. Still really refreshing!

My wife comes from a family from mexico. She has been saying how she wishes she could have strawberry water again from her grandma (who passed years ago.) I came across this and made it with our freshly picked strawberries... Guess I made it comparable to her grandma. Thanks for this recipe

A great change from just plain water. The only thing I did was put in half the sugar. I tried one glass with just the strawberry water and another with a slice of lime in it. I prefer the lime in it. It adds a nice twist!

This is something new to me. I thought this was very good. The only thing is, because I did not have fresh limes and mint sprigs, I had to improvise by using mint extract and lime juice in place of these ingredients. The mint extract brings out the flavor in this beverage.

This was really refreshing!  I did not strain out the seeds.  That seemed like too much work and it actually added a nice component to the drink by having it a little 'pulpy'.  I will definitely make this again for a picnic or bbq!

I bet this would be absolutely delicious with strawberries, and I tried it with green apples instead, and it was really good, especially if you add a little lemon juice to make it less sweet if that bothers you.

I've made this recipe twice already. It's absolutely wonderful and refreshing. Both times I doubled the recipe, and it doesn't last long in my house. For adult drinks, I add Skyy Strawberry flavored Vodka; very yummy. I've always like pulp in drinks (orange juice, etc), so I don't strain the berries. I blend very well, throw all in large pitcher with water, and let set over night in fridge. Everyone loves the pulp and flavor.

Scaled this way down to have a serving for DH to carry to work in his water bottle.  Delish.  Just used the strawberries, sugar and water, with ice for the latter part of water, tho am sure it would be great with the lime and mint and hope to try that way.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't love strawberries so I made this once with blueberries and now every other day with frozen mango chunks. I use Splenda instead of sugar, and I don't strain the pulp. It's cut my pop consumption to nearly nothing. Tonight I'm trying watermelon! The mango water has an added benefit: the potassium keeps the muscle spasms in my hands away. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATED 7-31-2019: The watermelon was fantastic, so sweet and summery, and cantaloupe agua fresca blew me away. I pureed the very ripe leftover cantaloupe and froze it, then when I needed it, I thawed it, added water and sugar, and couldn't tell the difference at all. From one Olivia to another, thanks a MILLION.

This is delicious!  I have made this recipe several times.  I don't measure the strawberries.  I just blend whatever the amount is in a container.  Sometimes I feel like less sweetness, and make a batch using half the sugar.  I have also mixed it with iced tea, which makes a lovely refreshing drink as well.

Refreshing drink.  I made this and cut the sugar almost in half.  The flavor isn't pounding or anything, but it's a light drink that's nice and cool.  More interesting than regular water and almost as healthy!

I liked this more than I thought I would. It's especially a great use for strawberries that are starting to get a little old. I think I could cut back on the sugar. I will make it again.

In hind sight, I wish I had only made a half recipe, as this makes a lot.  This was good, but I'm used to (and prefer) the refreshing tartness of a a true lemonade/strawberry lemonade.  I used half honey/half sugar for the sweetener, and really liked the taste.

Cut recipe in half and used Splenda instead of sugar.  It was delicious!!  I usually do not like flavored water, but this is so much more than just flavored water.  It tastes wonderful and is refreshing.  I did use a dash of seltzer water in my glass when I poured it and it made a world of difference.  The lime and mint are perfect complements to the strawberries.

This was the first time I had ever made strawberry water, so I don't know if there's better recipes out there LOL but I liked it. I'd make it again. If strawberries weren't expensive, I would have made it again already. LOL

I followed reviewer lvmy2girls and just put the ingredients in a blender (didn't strain). I transferred the mixture to a glass carafe and will let it chill overnight. I look forward to trying it plain or adding seltzer water.  I'd also like to try the recipe using other fruits such as cantaloupe, watermelon, or peaches and maybe adding some spirits! This looks like a very refreshing summer drink! Happy July 4th, and thanks, Olivia!

I used fresh blueberries instead of strawberries. OUTSTANDING!! Very light and refreshing - perfect for the summer. I also did not strain it because I do not have a wire strainer. It still worked fine; it just has pulp.

This turned out really well.  I started with half the sugar and it wasn't sweet enough.  The full cup was a little too sweet, so I'd use 3/4 if I made it again.  I used it with rum for a mixed drink and it was very good.  I'd probably cut out 1/2-1 cup of water if you're using it as a mixed drink to keep the strawberry flavor.  I had to dump and rinse my strainer several times because it got clogged up with the pulp, so allow a little time for that.  A pleasant, refreshing surprise.  I'd like to try other types of fruit with this, too.
