This is a now good.  The shell of the recipe is good, but you need to add celery, bell peppers, heavy whipping cream instead of evp milk and Jack cheese. And for the love of all that is good and pure you need salt, pepper and Tony's seasoning.

this sounds good, I've never used velveeta. I've always used ricotta cheese. Either way, i love pistolettes!

I was unable to find pistolette rolls or anything that remotely resembled them so I went with onion buns. Not the same but  they are ones we like and I knew they would hold up well in the deep fry. After reading the reviews I decided to add some chopped green bell pepper and I do think this recipe needed it. If I were to make again I would also add some Old Bay seasoning to the mix. Overall good recipe and one I would make again when I had leftover crawfish tails.
