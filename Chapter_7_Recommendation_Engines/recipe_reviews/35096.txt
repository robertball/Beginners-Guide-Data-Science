I followed the directions exactly and I think next time I will double the rhubarb and skip the almond flavoring.  It was way too sweet.

This was very delicious, in fact, we liked the combination of cherries/rhubarb instead of strawberry/rhubarb. I didn't make any changes to it at all.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love the taste of almond, but sometimes almond extract can make something taste too sweet to me.  So I replaced it with 1/2 tsp vanilla extract; I also added a splash or two of fresh lemon juice, per reviewer Spongebob7's suggestion.  Used slivered almonds in the topping and that was a good combo with the cherry pie filling.  Broiled topping for about 2 minutes at the end to get it a little more golden and bubbly and try to crisp it up a bit more.  Brought it to our neighborhood potluck and people who said they do not like rhubarb commented on really liking it as they gobbled it up!  So thanks, Kel!

I loved this recipe, I had to make a few changes, mostly out of need because I did not have on hand what it called for. I tend to cook with what is in my house rather then go get what I may be able to substitute. I used a bag of frozen dark red cherries and also was using frozen rhubarb. Since using frozen I omitted the water. I increased the cornstarch to compensate for the fact I was loosing the thickness of the pie filling. In the crust I increased the fine walnuts to 3/4 cup and also the butter to 1/2 + 2 Tablespoons. I am not sure if it was because of these changes but I did not have a problem with either the filling being to sweet or not having enough crust or the crust not being crisp enough. My family adored this and has said they wish me to make it again and the same way. Not to use the pie filling even if I were to have it. So just another possibility to a great base recipe.  happy cooking

i made this for my rhubarb-loving husband for father's day, and it was a hit with 3 generations of family! the only change i made was out of necessity -- i didn't have any cornstarch, and used 6tbsp flour to replace the 3tbsp cornstarch. it worked great!

Everyone loved this and had seconds! It was very tasty and not too sweet. I had hoped the topping would have been a little crisper though. I will replace the almond extract with a teaspoon of lemon juice next time for a fresher summer flavor.

From rhubarb lovers in our house, we all give this recipe 5 stars! We were surprised by the cherries, but totally delighted with another way to enjoy our rhubarb!

Very tasty recipe.  I added only 3/4 cup sugar to the cherry pie filling and I still thought it was sweet.  I have the strawberry rhubarb in my garden which is sweeter than regular rhubarb.

Wow, was this good!!  I followed the recipe exactly - no adjustments needed.  Note that you can use old-fashioned oats or 'quick' oats.  I used 'light' cherry pie filling the second time, and it cut down on the sweetness, which I liked.  Definitely serve it warm, with vanilla ice cream!  Thanks for the recipe!

The other reviews of this recipe are right on!  My family just loves this recipe.  The only thing I might do differently the second time is to make a little more of the crust. Highly recommend this!

I'd never tried a cherry-rhubarb combination before and have made this several times as everyone loves it.  I left out the nuts and used a squeeze of lemon juice in place of almond extract.  To lighten the recipe slightly I have occasionally made it using half the crust mixture (sprinkled it on top, omitted the bottom layer).

Delicious--I did not change a thing in this recipe and I didn't find it too sweet as others said. It was a nice change from the usual strawberry/rhubarb combo. This will be one of my go to recipes for fast easy and yummie! I will try another flavour pie filling next time-- maybe blueberry or peach. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the BEST CRISP RECIPE that I have ever tasted. I loved having a bottom crust as well as a tasty top crust with nuts. Rhubarb is an acquired taste but with this recipe where cherries are mixed in I think that even the "persnickiest eater" would enjoy this easy to make dessert. You could use this crumb crust for any fruit crisp. Great recipe Kel, thanks a lot for sharing it with all of us!

Holy Cow! This was awesome. I made this almost two weeks ago  and I really want to make it again. I did make a few changes. I used fresh cherries (off a friend's cherry tree), and I used splenda instead of sugar. I used more splenda than the recipe called for but I think thats because I didn't use cherry pie filling. I also only used 3 cups of rhubarb because I thought 4 would be too much. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and added some flaxseed to make it a little healthier. I tried this without ice cream and I thought it was amazing and then tried it with ice cream and I thought that it can't get much better than this. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was looking for a way to use up rhubarb and cherries I found at the bottom of my freezer, now that spring is here and a new crop should be coming soon.  I followed the recipe (other than that I didn't measure the fruit-what I had was close) with the difference being I used frozen sweet cherries instead of the pie filling.  The crisp was delicious.  Not too sweet but sweet enough.  I will certainly make this again.

I only had frozen  Bing (sweet) cherries, but the rhubarb made it taste like tart pie cherries!    Since my frozen cherries and rhubarb created so much liquid when thawed, I only added 1/2 C. water to the cornstarch mixture and it came out perfectly.  I doubled the topping

Looking for something I hand't tried before to use up the last of my rhubarb.  The TANG is what I love about rhubard, so w/ that in mind and after reading the reviews, I left out the almond extract as I was afraid it would make the cherry layer too sweet.  The only other change I made was to make extra topping as we like the crunch layer to be fairly thick.  The combo of rhubard and cherries is wonderful.  But next time I will simply use two cans of the pie filling and skip making a syrup w/ it and adding extra sugar, I think it just took too much of the tang out of this for me.

This recipe is very simple and easy to follow. It tasted like i had made it a million times though. It calls for so few ingrediants which I also liked. I will make this again. Oh and I served it with chocolate vanilla check ice cream. The combination of vanilla chocolate cherry almond and rhubarb was a really wonderful mixture actually I will not eat it any other way :) Yummy

I tried cooking with rhubarb again and this recipe made it work! I even threw the rhubarb in with the cherry pie filling to make sure it was cooked through. The pie filling contributes to the easiness. The crisp layers taste great. It's not the quickest recipe - any time you have to stir a cornstarch mixture til it boils, you can expect it to take several minutes, but it is always worth the effort.

This is excellent.  I used frozen cherries and rhubarb and used the cherry juice in lieu of the water.  Thickened the juice mixture and folded in the fruit.

Used arrowroot in place of cornstarch since I was out, light cherry pie filling, and 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a cup.  Wasn't too sweet at all, was a very nice balance - would even go with the full cup of sugar called for.  I made extra crust because I was worried there wouldn't be enough, but it would have been fine - if anything, I wouldn't have minded more filling.  But this was simple, delicious and went over very well for a family dinner.  Would make again.

This was delicious! I used unsweetened cherries in water instead of sweetened cherry pie filling and it was delicious, just the right amount of sour/sweet ratio. Great warm with vanilla ice cream!

A bit too sweet for my taste, but good.  Would reduce the sugar since the cherries are already sweet.  We used fresh cherries and thought it was a good call.

The combination of rhubarb and cherries is unusual but delicious.  I substituted 1/2 a bag of frozen cherries for the pie filling since I didn't have pie filling on hand and it was perfect.  I think the pie filling with it's sugar would have made it a bit too sweet.

I really liked the flavor of the almond extract.  I wish the topping would have been a little more "crisp", but I didn't use any nuts in it due to allergies.  I also used lite pie filling so it wasn't SO sweet.  Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe. I had been searching for a recipe like this for quite some time after having something similar elsewhere. The only change I made was adding almonds in place of the pecans/walnuts, as had been suggested by another reviewer, but then I love almonds. Others may find that a bit much with the almond extract. Thanks for the great recipe.

Awesome recipe!!!  Just pulled this out of the oven and took a little taste and it is unbelievable.  I love the cherries in it.  Don't know why I never thought to put some in before finding this recipe.  The only thing I did different was to heat the rubarb with the sugar/water mixture then add the cherry pie filling (just because that is how I make my rubarb crisp).  This will be so good this winter when I'm looking for a taste of spring.  Thanks.

WOW!  AWESOME!  If using sweeter rhubarb (called 'strawberry rhubarb'), cut down the sugar.  I've made this twice - once w/real butter and once w/margarine.  The real butter gives a far superior crust.

My husband, who loves cherry and rhubarb, thought it was only mediocre.  He didn't like the nuts in the topping.  I took the rest to church the next morning and they ate it all up, though nobody raved about it.

If there were only two words to describe this, it would be THE BEST! Needing to use up some rhubarb in the fridge over Memorial Day weekend, and not wanting another pie, decided to try this. Highly recommend it if looking for something other than rhubarb pie to make. Will definately add this to my recipe collection!!!!

The crisp was very good. It tastes just like the recipie from a BH&G recipie book. The only thing I would change would be to make the cherry mixture a little thicker.

Very yummy stuff! I omitted the nuts to please the family, but I don't think they were missed. I made two batches at once (we have a rhubarb patch) so everyone at work could try it-they loved it too! The cherries made a nice addition to the rhubarb.

Great recipe!!  I used double the amount of rhubarb & added 1/4 tsp of lemon juice. Then I baked the 40 min but broiled it an additional 4 min. It turned out great. Sets up really nice. Great sweet & sour mixture. Added whip cream on top.

Instead of cherry pie filling I used Oregon dark sweet cherries in heavy syrup, which isn't quite as sugary as pie filling.  Works great!  This recipe is surprisingly easy to put together and something different from the traditional strawberry/rhubarb.  I bake in an enamel coated cast iron dutch oven and it comes out perfectly every time.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of not adding the nuts. It needed 10-15 minutes of added baking time, but just check it since different ovens vary. It was delicious and will make it again for sure! Serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was excellent. As suggested by one reviewer, I made a little extra of the crust. I added an extra 1/3 cup of flour, brown sugar, and oats plus an extra 3 tbsp butter.  I also used a little extra almond extract. Everyone raved and the whole pan was gone in no time!

It sounded good, but was "gloppy" & sweet. I think I prefer a fruit crisp that doesn't use all the cornstarch & the already cornstarched pie filling. It definitely needed the ice cream to cut the sweetness. Wish I'd saved my can of cherry pie filling for something else.

One word. YUMMY!!! I made this this summer for a BBQ dinner we had (yes I know, I'm a little late doing my review, sorry) I added a little extra almond extract to the pie filling, about 2 tsps. I also added 1 Tblsp of good vanilla. For the crust I used sliced toasted almonds. It had a great mild almond flavor and then the tang of the cherrys and rhubarb were great together! We served it with vanilla ice cream. Perfect for any casual or potluck style dinner. We had a guest that night who does not like desserts much, and he ended up having 2 helping, so that's saying something. Thank you for this recipe. It's been added to my list of faves!

This is my most favorite.  I have shared it with many people already and will be taking it to work in the morning and know I will be sharing with many more.  My pan is a little bigger so have added another 1/2 to the Crust.  Since I love rhubarb I have added an extra cup. This is a keeper.

I'm not a big "canned" cherry pie filling fan but I gave this a whirl.  I figured where the rhubarb was so bitter the contrast might be warranted.  This was excellent!  Not as sweet as I was afraid it might be.  This is a nice flavor change from the everyday average crisp.

I am not a big fan of cherry pie filling, but substituting regular cherries worked just fine! I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch to make up for the lost syrup and mixed some sugar in with my cherries before I put them into the pan.  Next time I'll add some cinnamon or nutmeg into the crust because it didn't have a lot of flavor. Definitely putting more butter into the crust as well because it was more crumb than crisp after baking. Overall, great change from rhubarb-strawberry monotony!

Overly sweet.  Could use more rhubarb.

I like to use rhubarb from the yard but many recipes only call for a small amount. I'm not a huge fan of rhubarb, but I want to use it since it's free produce growing in our yard. 

WOW! I will make this again! I made the recipe with butter and added an extra handful of old fashioned oats.  I also added a  pinch of cardamom and cinnamon and added a scant amount of sugar (a little less then was called for).  I loved the cherries, almond extract and pecans. It had just the right tart/sweet taste.

Turned out great.  I took it to a cookout and everyone raved about it.  I did bake it a little longer than the recipe called for but wanted a more brown top and crust.  Definitely a keeper and my new go to rhubarb recipe.

After reading the comments about it being too sweet, I cut back the 2 cups of sugar to 3/4 cup each and used 1-2 tbsp fresh lemon juice instead of the almond extract.  It was just right - not too sweet with a hint of tartness. Yummy!

Loved this recipe! I also use it for cherry and blueberry crunch. Everyone loves it. Thanks for sharing. Didn't change a thing,except when I made it with cherries I added a little bit of Almond extract.

It was a great recipe. However I am not sure why did it need so much sugar. I used half amount of sugar and it tasted fantastic and a little bit healthier. I used half amount of sugar for both the cherry mix and the flour mix and I also used frozen cherries instead of canned.

I hate when people change the recipe, but my suggestion is to put the fruit on the bottom, sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and the almond extract then sprinkle a box of red (cherry or strawberry) gelatin, then put ALL the crumbs on top, and bake as usual--you get the gel without cooking the cornstarch, and more crunch on top.

I made a 2nd version of this using Blueberry pie filling & Lemon extract instead of the almond.  They were equally good, but I wish I would have actually stirred the rhubarb into the pie filling mixture instead of layering as the recipe calls.

Very good.  I made it exactly as directed and it was a hit.  I think next time I'll put all of the crust/topping on the top like I do with apple crisp.

I had been salivating for almost a week waiting for my rhubarb to get big enough to use and today when I saw that it was, I scanned the recipes for something unique to make.  This was it!!  My husband loves rhubarb crisp and this was a nice change from the usual.  The cherries were a nice addition ... just the right mixture of tangy, sweet and tart.  I used almond slivers though instead of walnuts.  I enjoy making deserts but don't usually eat them ... I couldn't resist this though and a sample teaspoon ended up being a full serving... I loved it ... and so did he!  Will definitely make again .. probably for pot luck dinner

Thought it was absolutely delicious.  Loved the almond flavor.  I think next time I'll cut down on the crumble as one layer would still be great.  Will definitely make again. Thanks so much!

Really good recipe to start with and then after reading the other reviews I decided to cut the sugar in half to suit my taste.  Plus I cut 1/4 cup of the butter out and since I had but 2 cups of rhubarb (the last of the season) I used fresh strawberries to make up the other 2 cups required.  It was very tasty and especially good the following day after work.

I never made anything with rhubarb before but I made it a few weeks ago and it turned out really nice, everyone loved it especially my fiance. They want me to make more soon. I wasn't sure if I should make it but my favorite part was using the pie filling because I love eating cherries.

Exceptional blend of flavors! The oat mixture as a bottom layer crust and topping makes this dessert sing in your mouth. Followed the recipe to a tee and enjoyed every bite!

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit.  Served it with ice cream.  I really like the bottom layer which helps it stay together.  I used "lite" cherry pie filling and omitted the nuts since my son doesnt care for them.  Thanks for the recipe.

We thought this was a delicous recipe.  Even my two children loved it... one is typically the world's PICKIEST eater, but she loved it as well.  Very easy to make.  We served it with Cool Whip.  We'll definitely be making this one again!

Everyone at our Small Group liked it.  Even those who don't care for rhubarb might like it.  Have not tried it on children yet.  Had a request for the recipe and passed it on.  Most time-consuming part is the crust/topping.  Great with ice cream!
