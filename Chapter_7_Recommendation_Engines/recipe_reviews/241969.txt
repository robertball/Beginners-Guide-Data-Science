I didn't have the chili powder so took the advice of another reviewer and used taco seasoning. Also, we like things spicy and tomato-y, so I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes (original w/ green chilis), which was a few more ounces than called for in the recipe. I was afraid a "no-bake" recipe wouldn't be that great. However, it turned out wonderfully. Hubby could not get enough and raved about how good it was. He also asked to add this to the regular rotation. 

I think the ingredients here (minus the noodles) would make a good base for a Mexican chili. I'm going to try subbing out the noodles with various beans and see if I can make it work. 

Try this recipe. You wont' regret it!

I used this recipe as a base and threw in a few extra things like pinto beans and Mexican oregano. Couldn't believe how good it was for being so easy! I was really hesitant to use pasta sauce as a base for something that is supposed to be chili, but it worked out great! Topped with lots of cheese and some avocado. Sour cream would probably be good too!

Obviously food is subjective but this did not work out flavor-wise for our family.  

We made one batch using the exact directions and another batch using Rotel per one of the reviewers suggestions but neither worked out as a something we'd want to eat again.

I subbed a pkg of taco seasoning mix for the spices and a can of tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes because we don't like chunks... Kids and hubby had seconds. I will make again.

I used plain canned tomatoes because we don't like too much heat.  I did add a dash of pepper though.  It was a nice change of pace for dinner and I already had all the ingredients except the chili powder.  Oh, I used ground turkey instead of beef without any issues.

This was excellent... Didn't change a thing but if I were to, I would use crushed tomatoes, the tomatoes are a little chunky.  I will make this all the time.  Thanks for a great dish!

Good simple recipe!  Used reg canned diced tomatoes and grated some fresh jalapeño into it, worked fine.  This was a great easy weeknight meal, with tons of leftovers!

I really liked and the family approved as well! I used taco seasoning as some other reviewers suggested and that worked great.

I was suspicious when I saw the pasta sauce but this turned out rather good. Really nice and quick for a weekday.

Made this according to the recipe....except we had 2 lbs of hamburger instead of one.  A little too much chili powder for us.....but I will make it again, just decreasing the amount of chili powder.

This is a great base recipe that you can alter to fit your needs. We made this for dinner tonight but altered it with what we had in the fridge and cupboard. It was super easy and really good. Instead of ground beef we used hot ground pork sausage  with sautéed onion, garlic, and peppers.  We stirred in stew tomatoes, tomato soup, and chili seasoning..  Cooked elbow noodles separately and later added them to the sauce. Topped it with shredded cheese.  This is a great  basic recipe for a fast  home cooked meal that can be altered however you like .

I didn't have the Chili power,so I used 1 tablespoon of Tabasco sauce.  It gave it a little more "tang".  Not bad at all!

Easy and tasty.  only change is I would say is use whatever spaghetti sauce you prefer.   I found the ragu they have in recipe to be flavorless.   I will make it again,  but with the sauce I normally use for my spaghetti.

I made this according to the recipe with one exception: no Ragu sauce. It was delicious. I made it again and decided to follow the recipe and added the Ragu: terrible.
Will definitely make again but omit the spaghetti sauce.

Except for sautéing a little onion and garlic with the ground beef, I made this per the recipe.  I could do without the corn.  It tastes like you can imagine with the given ingredients.  My husband liked it more than I did.  It was OK, but I doubt I'll make it again.

I left out the corn so I used more noodles.  Instead of the rotel I used tomato sauce so it would be more mild for the kids and not have those hunks of tomatoes that they get picky about.  We all loved it!

This makes a lot! I'd say six hefty servings.  It's very tasty and sort of on the spicy side which may not be appropriate for some. Next time, I might try using regular tomatoes as some have suggested rather than the Ro-tel and I'll bump up the spices a bit. Excellent recipe and no need to change a thing, other than the "heat" level. Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this. It was a little spicy for my kids so I might try it with regular diced tomatoes next time. Great for an easy weeknight meal, though!
