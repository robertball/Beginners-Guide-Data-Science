We loved this! So easy to make. I  I did 2 things differently, I added the chicken stock (before adding everything else) to deglaze the pot and I used Hatch Chiles in place of the Anaheim 
Chiles because that's what I had. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe! Will be making this again.

loved it! Didn’t add all of the peppers though, because  I just didn’t have them and didn’t have seasoned  salt but still delicious.

I used fresh jalapeño and green chiles instead of the canned versions. Toss them and the onion in during the saute session and continue as planned. Delicious!

Made this exactly according to the recipe except for omitting the Larry’s salt because I didn’t have any. I substituted a tsp of taco seasoning, and it turned out great! Very flavorful. Fair warning though, it is quite spicy. I love spicy food, but this may be too much for some. A little sour cream on top and it was delicious, and even better the next day.

This recipe is so delicious!!! I have to say, when you pull it out of the insta pot it doesn’t look super appetizing. But it has sooooo much flavor.
