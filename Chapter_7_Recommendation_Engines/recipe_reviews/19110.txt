DELICIOUS! I used fat-free yogurt and skim milk to cut down on calories! Also I garnished the cake with strawberry slices covered in chocolate syrup! Definitely a keeper! Thanks!:P

This is good and I did find it nice and moist. I think the people who complained that the cake was dry probably left it too long in the oven. I think it's the sort of cake that can go from moist to dry very quickly. I added a little more liquid than what the recipe called for (eg: just slightly over 1/2C of veg oil slightly more than 1/2C of yoghurt) to prevent it from being dry. I would definitely make it again!

Very moist and tasty. I didn't have a 9" square pan so made it in two round 8" pans. Baked for 25 minutes and it turned out great. Sandwiched the two with chocolate spread. Thanks for the recipe!

Too dry even though I added 3 tablespoons milk to dough by accident. Cook less?

I made these and from suggestions of others added a few tbsp of milk to the batter. I used plain greek 0% fat yoghurt. I also changed 1/2 cup of flour to 1/2 cup of cocoa powder because I was looking for a chocolate recipe - I made these into 16 cupcakes. I didn't have butter on hand which is mainly why I picked this recipe. The cupcakes only took 15 minutes to bake and I am at altitude (Calgary AB) but they were tasty and moist. I haven't iced them yet will be making them into some kind of halloween treat. Thanks for the recipe! Rating of 4 stars because I didn't make it as-written. The cupcakes were more dense than fluffy which is fine with me because I want to dress them up and I don't want them to be too fragile.

Really REALLY dry cake. The cake was NOT sweet either. To top it off the icing was extremely bitter and I'm a HUGE dark chocolate fan. Will only try again with more sugar and milk in cake batter and semi sweet chocolate in the icing. What a disappointment.

Maybe I'm just missing it but where does it say to add chocolate to the cake? My husband and I both thought this was dry and lacked flavor. Very tough too. Live in Denver and maybe the altitude had something to do with it but we were really diasappointed with this.

I must have goofed somewhere although I think I followed the instructions closely. No flavor and bitter icing.

I love this cake I made then into cupcakes and they tasted great I used low fat yoghurt and condensed milk and skimmed milk to keep it lower in fat and it tasted great - will be experimenting with different flavoured yoghurt next time. Thank you for this recipe.

I added 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder and half cup of chocolate chips to the cake. It really tastes good even without the toppings!
