We thought this was really different with the fruit puree and no tomato.  I pureed the fruit with a bit of mango juice and skipped the butter before covering the chicken with this yummy sauce.  Next time I would add the peppers a bit later in the cooking process to retain more kick and cut back the sugar and add a bit of vinegar for better balance.  Thanks for the awesome idea.

Just finished making this recipe, and it was better than expected. Only Substitutions I made were 3 Habaneros vs 2 that were called for, used ground ginger instead of fresh, added a tablespoon of tomato paste and a few red pepper flakes for color. Absolutely delicious. This will be made again.
