I am on a low-carb, high fat diet and this is the perfect food!  It is truly the best comfort food without potatoes in existence.  It actually tastes quite like "hashbrown casserole" aka "funeral potatoes."  It was easy to make (my ten year-old did it with little supervision) and the whole family had multiple servings.  Because of the bacon and cheese, this casserole was perfect as a meal; just served with a side salad.  I absolutely recommend this dish!

My husband and I loved this recipe. However, we did not use low fat ingredients as we are watching our sugar intake (low fat = added sugar). Perfect alternative to loaded mashed potatoes.

This is orange, because I got a big orange cauliflower for 99 cents. This is tasty but you don't need a lot of the stuff in there. IMHO I use the full amount of cottage cheese, 2 ounces of ff cream cheese and 1/4 c of ff Greek yogurt in lieu of the sour cream. I was going to add the cheddar cheese to the dish but it really didn't need it... so I topped the dish with a little cheddar. only 1/4 cup. I think with all the other stuff added, this might have been over doing it....so if you make this, start with less of the add ins... you may not need or want them all.

No you do not NEED all the stuff, but you will want it!!! Please do not leave any ingredients out, as one cook suggested!!! This is perfect exactly the way it is written.  My 5 year old son and 14 month old grand daughter loved this casserole, as did my husband and I.

Awesome! I steamed the cauliflower, instead of microwaving (maintains flavor and nutrients). Also sauteed celery, garlic, shallots, and 1/2 of a medium red onion in a bit of the bacon fat, a little butter, turmeric, crushed red pepper flakes, salt and pepper; then added this mix, once veggies were tender, to the cauliflower, and blended as instructed (also added a smidgen of buttermilk). Loved it, loved it! Celery added some nice texture to this dish. Cauliflower is my new best friend! Thanks, Erik!!

This is excellent as written!  I had an abundance of cauliflower in our garden so I made and froze several trays to enjoy over the winter.  When making in bulk I substituted cubed smoked ham for the bacon, it’s excellent either way.

It was very tasty. I made it with only 2 changes. I omitted the bacon and left the cauliflower in chunks similar to macaroni noodles. It was really flavorful and cheesy.Next time I will make the recipe smoother like mashed potatoes and use the bacon. I also used a bag of frozen broccoli florets steamed in the microwave for convenience.

pretty good! This is the first time I've made cauliflower especially this way. I usually just by the frozen green giant with cheese sauce cook it longer so I can mash the cauliflower. I got my husband to try the box stuff and then I saw this recipe so I decided to give it a try. My husband is picky and he actually said he liked this. So try it you'll like it.

Amazing recipe, we all loved it!  I halved the recipe (9x9 pan) using one (of 4) bag of frozen rice cauliflower from Costco.  Microwaved it, so easy!
Also added some chili flakes, powdered garlic and powdered onion (although real would work too). 
Flavor was great!

So good!!  And if you don’t use low fat it’s a perfect dish for a low carb diet!  I added some diced jalapeños to part of the dish.

Very good. Kids thought it was a creamy mashed potato bake. Great if you can get cauliflower cheap or you need to cut out potatoes. Otherwise, potatoes would probably yield the same taste and go a lot further!

I had to edit my previous review after making this the second time because it was really delicious!  I didn't use any low-fat items b/c we are low-carb.  I cooked some extra bacon and cut it into large pieces and reserved a bit of it to combine with the cheese on the top.  I also added some Duke's mayo to the mix. Next time may add some home-grown, sautéed spring onions. Husband wants to know when we'll be having it again! =)
