This was delicious!  I sized the recipe down to serve 5, and added all the ingredients(except bay leaves, didn't have any), into the crock-pot.  Turned it up to high for about 4-5 hours.
Instead of bone-in chicken pieces I used boneless chicken thighs, and dried dill instead of fresh.
My family ate with no complaints!  We enjoyed the soup with some stoned wheat crackers. It makes great left overs the next day.
Thank you Star20 for the great borsht. 5 stars...would make again! :)

My family of four thought this was acceptable but not a do-again.  I followed the recipe exactly but we just did not enjoy it that much.  Sorry!

Very nice soup.  Made vegetarian version with Morningstar "meat" crumbles.  Halved recipe and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato soup.  Added a few cloves of minced garlic and used dry instead of fresh dill.  Resulted in a great soup that my wife and I both really enjoyed.  Will definitely make again. 4.5 stars.

I enjoyed the recipe. I added some salsa to make it a little spicier. This is a keeper for our family.

This is just how I remember it. I make this soup in big batches and freeze it. It keeps really well. It's not for everyone, in fact my fiance and father won't touch it, but I think it's wonderful. I don't bother with the bay leaves, maybe it would be better with them but I don't want to mess with a good thing. Anway, thanks for posting it.

I made this soup with vegetarian chicken patties instead of chicken, and it was a big hit with my family.  My daughter asked me to make this a lot more often!

This was just like my grandma used to make it.  Very yummy with the sour cream and I added a splash of jalape√±o juice to spice it up.  The whole family was happy.

pretty good for a base but next time i will use plain chicken broth and not fool around with the bones and skin, etc.  i will instead add seasoned ground turkey or chicken and of course add a ton of minced garlic.

I made this after a coworker brought me some of her "family's Borscht" so I went searching for a similar recipe. It's delicious! I struggle with sticking to a recipe... always trying to kick it up. lol. I added crushed tomatoes and a little bit of Worcestershire sauce. Yummy!!! I will definitely make this again.

Classic Ukrainian borscht has to have beets in it. Usually it takes 2 big or 3 smaller beets, shredded or thinly sliced. I sometimes omit potatoes and add a can of red kidney beans.

Since when did this soup become German?
By the way, this is not soup :)
