I loved this recipe. I made this for a get together we are having tomorrow night, but had to try it tonight because the batter was amazing. I did add a little more milk to make sure it would stay moist. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. I put this in a bundt pan to make it decorative and baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. I will probably add more chocolate chips next time, but I love chocolate chips.

My hubby loved this!  It was delicious and easy.  I made it as written with the exception that I didn't have a 9" springform pan.  I put it in a cake pan I had and it finished baking in about 30 minutes.  Very good coffee cake.

Great recipe! My family loves this cake. I have been making this for many years. The recipe first appeared in the 70s in a book called Cookery for Entertaining. If it’s too dry, you cooked it either too hot and for too long. To avoid that, we tend to undercook it a bit.  Also, extra topping is very nice, especially if it gets crunchy along the sides. BTW, it does not work well with fat free cream cheese.  But it does work well with extra chocolate chips ??

This was a very good dense coffee cake and everyone loved it!!  The chocolate chips were a nice added touch and they did not sink to the bottom of the pan!  The only change I made was to use brown sugar with the cinnamon for extra flavor and I doubled the dose.  I will definitely make this one again.

This was an easy to make but really good recipe.  I did cut down the sugar in the coffee cake from 1 1/4 to 1 cup and hubby who was a very sweet tooth still loved it.  I think it was due to the sugar you get from the chocolate chips.  Next time I may even substitute the chocolate chips for apple because I think that would be a god combination  with the pecans and cinnamon...or maybe a combination of white chocolate chips and apple?  Thanks for the recipe!

I made the cake without nuts and it was very favorably received.  Several friends asked if it was an old family recipe.  No but it is about to become one.

I loved this very easy to make coffee cake.  Made it 3 times in 2 weeks for various events.  I prefer w/o nuts.  Ages 8 - 80 loved it.

This is really good! I made a double batch because sweets don't last long around here. I'm a night person and always cook in the middle of the night...my step dad woke up (around midnight) and had to come out to see what I was up to because he could smell it cooking! LOL

It was a huge hit at our hockey pot luck breakfast!  My son has requested that I make it again.  I did put a brown sugar streusel topping on it instead of what the recipe called for.

I made this coffee cake this morning and my family liked it. I followed the recipe as written. I didn't give it five stars only because it was a bit to sweet for me. I will make it again but I may try it with a layer of brown sugar and cinnamon in the middle instead of the chips.

I used just a regular glass pan and took it out at about 35 minutes. It was great my husband and in-laws just loved it. I will definitely keep this as a favorite.

I made this cake as per the recipe except I didn’t have a spring form pan.  I used a tube pan instead.  This cake is amazingly good!  Really moist and lovely.  Other people have used brown sugar in the struesal  topping and when I make this again, that’s what I’ll do.  So good!  Best recipe I’ve tried in a long time!

This is definitely my favorite coffee cake recipe.  I make it exactly as written and don't change anything. It is so moist and comes out perfect every time.  This is one of my go-to  recipes when I need to bring something to a get-together.   It is always a big hit.  The only problem is that it is too good and I end up eating several pieces a day until  it  is gone.

Super easy and yep I made changes. I am allergic to cinnamon so I used a combo of nutmeg, cardamom and ginger in my topping. It has a fantastic taste. I also used mini chocolate chips and I added mini chocolate chips to my topping as well it gives it a little more color and texture which I thought it was lacking. I also didn't have pecans on had so I used slivered almonds. It was very delightful and the ladies group I took it to said it was fantastic I'll definitely be making this one again . :-) I also found that my baking time was less than 55 it was actually closer to 45 min.

This coffee cake is delicious!  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I liked the sugar and the chocolate chips. They met my sweet tooth desires perfectly. The chopped pecans on the top became burnt, so next time I will omit the nuts. A plain top would be fine, since the cake is delicious as is, or perhaps a crumble topping would be good.

It came out moist and delicious. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that the chocolate was a little overwhelming. Cutting back on the chips should be perfect next time.

It was excellent! Made it for my husband and the guys on his construction site for their morning coffee break and they LOVED it! I added crushed pecans into the cake as well as on top. Didn't love the way they looked on top after cooking the first one, so I used less cinnamon and sugar the second round.

Someone said this was too dry but we thought it was delicious. The only change I made was to the topping where I used a different crumb recipe.

Very moist and full of flavor.  Did not use the topping and actually preferred it that way!

Cake was too dry.  Not moist at all, even warm or cold.  Did not like.
