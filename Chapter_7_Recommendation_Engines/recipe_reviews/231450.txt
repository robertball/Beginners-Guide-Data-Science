This was a great dish and I'll make this again! Here are the particualars of what happened in my kitchen. I used Jasmine brown rice. I cut the thick white stems out of the collard greens before I chopped the greens. Never having eaten okra I was a little scared so I threw in about a dozen fresh okra (cut into bite size pieces) and to make up for the difference I threw in about 6 fresh asparagus (cut into bite size pieces). I added about 2-3 cups of water at this point because the stew had very little liquid to simmer for an hour. I waited to add the cilantro until the kidney bean/tomato paste went in. I did not need to use flour because the stew was plenty thick. I said I addded 2-3 cups of water but it may have been 3-4 cups water. This was pretty thick and had NO broth at all. We were able to serve it on our plate instead of a bowl inspite of adding water- of course it didn't matter 'cuz the flavor was so good. One last note, this recipe doesn't call for salt. I added salt and more dill and ginger for more flavor. Great recipe, super healthy and easy to make. I served it with grilled tilapia and steamed broccoli.

We both didn't like the taste of the okra.

This is delish! We added fresh ginger -a knuckle sized chunk, peeled and pressed, as well as the powdered ginger. Added a quarter cup of Braggs brand apple cider vinegar to the greens to cook. We did not drain the greens, and the cidery broth from the greens added a nice texture and flavor to the stew. We quadrupled the amount of garlic, and added a dash of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of powdered garlic as well. To make it more Jamaican we added jerk spices to the mash, which worked really well. Also add some pigeon peas to the mash mixture.

this was a very good dish. I used okra from my garden. doubled up on the seasonings. I left the beans whole instead of mashing them. It's pretty thick, so next time i'll use less tomato paste and thin it down a tad with veg broth. good stuff though.

If you do not drain the completely in step 3 it will benefit the consistency of the stew later on. Overall, I did not enjoy this even as a side dish. It still felt incomplete even as a side and was more like a tomato or pasta sauce than a stew. If you leave out (or include) okra and chayote, the rest of the ingredients worked as a good addition to a Sloppy Joe (or pasta) sauce. Whether to use the beans or not is a matter of opinion.
