Great recipe with great muffin like texture. The second batch I made I substituted corn flour for the corn meal and used buttermilk. The second batch tasted the same but instead of having a smooth top they were rough and edgy like a bakery muffin. I also use super fine rice flour, it "opens" up the muffin. Have also made them using fresh peaches.

peaches instead, plus a bit of almond extract, and used coconut oil instead of butter. I baked it in a 9x9 pan and it was amazing!

My sister is on a special diet so our family is new to gluten free cooking. This recipe was delicious; my husband did not know it was gluten free until I told him. The texture is nice and light. The lemon zest and soured milk add to the layers of flavor. I had a request to add more berries, which I will do next time.

I have made these twice and my children love them!  They give the fluff and lightness of a gluten laden muffin without the allergen.  I was surprised by the lack of spices so I added cinnamon and nutmeg.

These are delicious muffins.  True, they have a bit of texture on account of the corn meal, but that makes them seem more wholesome.  I didn't have any blueberries and so made them without and they were still very tasty.

I used a glutenfree flour blend(without xanthan gum) rather than all rice flour, also added 2 tbl of ground flax, and used lemon juice instead of vinegar, baked for 25mins. Preheated the oven to 425F, then lowered it to 375F when I put in the muffins. Wonderful recipe! Great flavour, not dry.

Yum!  My non-gluten free kids teens even liked them!  I cut sugar to 1/2 cup and used a whole package of frozen blueberries (rinsed with warm water to thaw).

It is hard to make gluten free food taste as good as the traditional wheat flour based foods, but this recipe is excellent!  The cornmeal gives a good texture that hides the rice flour texture.  Instead of milk and vinegar, I used some buttermilk and sour cream.  I used half the butter, and home grown, freshly milled corn meal instead of bought cornmeal.  Some batter didn't fit into my muffin pans, so I made 'muffin tops' in a cake pan, and the batter was stiff enough to make a very good muffin top too.  
I will be using this recipe without the berries to make cheese muffins and other variations.  Thanks for this recipe!

This makes more than 12 muffins, so I had a few extras (not that I minded). I used 1/4 cup honey in place of the sugar, and eliminated the vinegar.  This is dewberry season (a wild growing vine filled with small fruit similar to blackberries), so I used them in place of blueberries.  Yum!

These came out great - nice texture and delicious!  I ended up with 12 muffins and a small coffee cake (mini loaf pan size).  I did add a gf streusel topping to some of the muffins.

One thing I like about this recipe is the sour milk; I find that makes a better muffin or sweetbread.  I found these muffins a bit dry for my taste and not quite sweet enough.  The lemon zest was an excellent addition; gave them a bit of a kick.  I drizzled the slightly cooled muffins with the juice from half a lemon mixed with sugar, half a cup or so.  I filled mu muffin cups to the top and got 14, and they were cooked in 16 minutes.  I think I'll try them at 375 next time, with something to moisten them up, maybe some sour cream or applesauce added to the batter.

I will definitely make again. I used Aldi's GF Baking mix and Organic Coconut flour instead of corn meal, used only 2 tsp. baking powder bec the making mix had baking powder already in it. I used blueberries that were almost going bad, I didn't want to waste them. The muffins turned out fabulous. Turned broiler on for a minutes to give them a golden top!

These turned out really well.  Fluffy and delicious. I did use buttermilk instead of the sour milk. I only used 1/2 cup cornmeal and the rest was rice flour. Next time, I'm going to cut back on the baking powder from 4 teaspoons to just 3. Too much baking powder gives it a slightly bitter aftertaste.

I don't usually write a review if I've made changes but they were so minor I thought "why not?"  These were outstanding in flavor and texture. I used another whole egg instead of the egg plus 2 yolks (I only had 2 eggs) and cranberries for the blueberries. I used my stand mixture to get the butter and sugar fluffy and this helped lighten the texture. It made 12 muffins and a 6 inch "cake" I made in a small foil pan. Delicious and enjoyed by gluten eaters as well as me. Thank you for an excellent recipe.
