Too much Mayo! I liked the concept overall and toned down the mayo, using only 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup, but it was still too much. I'll probably make this again with just 1/4 cup mayo.

This is a great pasta salad!  I did not have mint on hand, so I reduced the parsley slightly, and did add some salt and pepper.  I also used Bowties for the pasta.  It was deliecious without the mint!

The mint and parsley are overpowering, and yet there isn't much flavor.  It's a little dry after it sits in the refrigerator; add ranch dressing to take care of this.  Make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper.
