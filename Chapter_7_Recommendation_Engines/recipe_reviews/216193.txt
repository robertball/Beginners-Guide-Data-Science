This was really yummy, and a great way to use the pheasant from the freezer!  We threw in some red bell peppers and thought that was a nice addition.

this is a great dish to make for friends and family. You may want to add a dash of salt an pepper to the chicken and just a dash of salt in the sauce for taste. If your having a dinner party this goes great with the Crostini with mozzarella and tomato

Not a big fan of pheasant, but everything works so well together, I will definitely make it again with chicken
