Didn't follow the exact recipe because I had leftovers to use up... but it was wonderful.  Changes I made:  Used leftover roast chicken, leftover boiled potatoes, can of carrots, fresh portabello mushrooms (chopped), 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, leftover chicken gravy (instead of cream of chicken soup).  Also on top I used crushed Ritz crackers dabbed with butter.  Kids and hubby loved it!  One suggestion is to cook for 45 minutes at 350 or for 30-40 @ 375 degrees.
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I loved this recipe! The change I made was not to use saltines but a refrigerated pie crust.  This pot pie works with chicken equally as well as with turkey.  My entire family loved it (which doesn't happen often) and it will become a regular at our house.

Not a very good recipe.  Too much of a kid's meal.  A lot like a pot pie, but with silly saltine crackers.  Will work better by simply excluding the crackers.  Bread crumbs may work well, but this recipe begs for a pie crust.

Excellent meal!  I threw just about all the leftovers from Christmas dinner, including gravy with the soups and it turned out delicious!

I was looking for a way to use up the leftover Xmas turkey. This definitely helped. I made adjustments also. I used two cans of cream of mushroom, green beans instead of peas, and sprinkled shredded mozzarella over the cream mixture just before I added crushed Ritz crackers. Loved it. Will make it again and again.

Very much like a turkey pot pie without the crust. I added some milk to cut the condensed soup. It was tasty but a little too salty for me. Next time I will use low sodium soups.

This worked well for leftover turkey breast I had in the freezer.  I used a fat free cream of chicken soup and chopped yellow onion in place of the pearl onions.  I left out the can of mushrooms because of personal preference.  My husband said a biscuit on top would be better than the cracker crumbs and I think he may be right.
