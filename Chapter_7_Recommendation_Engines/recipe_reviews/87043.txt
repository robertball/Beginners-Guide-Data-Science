5 Stars Plus!!!  YOWZA!!!  I made this exactly except that I made one error which I may continue to keep on doing!  I put vanilla ice cream and the strawberries in a desert dish and poured the syrup over that while the syrup was still very warm (stupid move I now know - but we loved what happened!)  When the syrup hit the cold ice cream it hardened (like the top of a creme brulee) while it remained syrupy on the strawberries.  I cannot tell you how we liked the result.  I am going to make it again tonite the proper way but this is a keeper!!!  And sooo easy - thanks submitter.

What a great idea! It reminded me of the way my mom used to prepare strawberries for us as kids. Just sugar, water, and let the sliced strawberries soak for a few hours in the fridge. Making it into a "syrup" with cinnamon and nutmeg definitely gives it a kick. I served it in a wine glass over 2 scoops of ice cream topped with a dollop of whipped cream, garnished with a mint leaf, and there you have a  rich, fancy dessert! It'll please the whole family! Yummy!

A nice and easy way to dress up strawberries. I used Splenda instead of sugar and the consistency was weird so I wouldn't recommend the substitution.  Pairs nicely with light Cool Whip for a low calorie desssert!

I made a trial run of this today, hoping I could put this in my Christmas baskets this year as pancake syrup. I did subtract two tbsp. water and added two tbsp. lemon juice. To make this a little thinner, I ran the berries through the blender, coarsely chopping them. I like it, just the way I hoped it would turn out though it is a little sweet. I might cut back the sugar just a bit. I'd like to see if I can't try this with cranberries, too.

This is wonderful!!! I made it exactly as above, only increased the syrup to one and a half batches (we like extra syrup)!  I also added a small package of blueberries to the strawberries. Put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on pound cake and topped it with the berries.  This is a keeper.

This is a ggreat recipe. Simple, savory and sweet. But, I saved on the sugar calories by using 1/4 cup sugar to one pound of strawberries 1/4 teaspoon of stavia instead. 

Thanks for this great idea.

Great stuff, LFRAME - Thanks! Mom used to do something like that, but without the nutmeg. Great on just strawberries - even better layered in a bowl, cooled in the fridge, then adding a couple scoops of homemade vanilla ice cream, strawberries, more syrup and a little whipped cream! Try it with pineapple bits and ice cream, too!

Delicious!  This was so easy to make.  At first, I was a tiny bit worried about pouring brownish, warm syrup all over my delicious, freshly picked, unsuspecting strawberries--but I'm glad I did!  I let the berries macerate in the syrup for a while, then poured it over pieces of Sara's Scrumptious Strawberry Shortcake; first, we sliced the shortcake down the middle, horizontally, then put the syrup on the bottom and top layers.  Let that soak while you walk to the corner grocery for some whipped cream...HEAVENLY!

Clearly I don't know how to make a simple syrup; this is the second recipe where I've messed it up.  I need to buy a candy thermometer and practice a few times!  I boiled this for 10 minutes, added the other ingredients, and let it sit for a few minutes off the heat as directed.  Well, it hardened in about a minute and wasn't syrupy at all!  So I added an extra 1/2 c. of water, re-melted the sugar, and boiled for about 3 minutes.  When I took it off the heat, it remained syrupy.  I just put it over sliced strawberries and it was tasty...the spices were a nice addition, as was adding a warm sauce.  So in spite of my inability to properly boil sugar and water, this still turned out quite yummy.  Thanks!

This is a fabulous recipe - I have used it many ways:  over butter pound cake, on ice cream, and my favorite - a heaping table spoon in a wine glass topped with dry sparkling wine - it's a crowd pleaser every time.  I am also using it for breakfast at my B&B, letting people top yogurt, corn cakes, etc.  I can't say enough good things about it!

Super simple, quick and very tasty! I poured it over some waffles and couldn't ge enough of it! I would use it on pancakes, biscuits or pound cake too. I want to try this same recipe with blueberries, apples and other fruit I always seem to have on hand.

Not too bad. I had only one pint strawberries so cut the recipe in 1/2. I also only used 1/3 cup sugar and it turned out nicely. I ate mine over chocolate and vanilla ice cream and my roommate ate his over some short bread!

Added a little anise seed when making syrup. Strain to remover seeds before pouring over fruit. Absolutely delisous. I've made this with a mixture of various in-season fruits. Put in fridge for a few hours to allow flavors to meld. Makes a cool and refreshing light dessert.

An unusual, but yummy recipe.  One usually doesn't add cinnamon to strawberries, but give it a try.  It's quite delicious.

Was looking for something besides the typical "pour a bunch of sugar over sliced berries" to use for strawberry shortcake, and found this.  Spectacular! and I haven't even served it yet!  I did however omit the nutmeg, simply because I did not have any.

Really yummy, the nutmeg and cinnamon were wonderful with the fresh berries. The two pints sliced strawberries yield a product with plenty of delicious strawberry-spiced syrup, in the future I'll probably use three pints with that amount of syrup for a thicker topping as is my preference. Thanks very much for sharing.

I've made this several times now - the first time I used it as pancake syrup.   I thawed frozen whole strawberries and mashed them with the sugar/water/spice syrup.  I made it the same way the second time, except used it as a dessert sauce over purchased pound cake with a spoonful of vanilla yogurt on top.

Maybe I shouldn't have given this 3 stars, because I think it was mostly my fault I didn't like it. I tried to follow the recipe but messed up. First, I addded the vanilla before boiling (not sure if that makes a difference). Then I guess I boiled it too long or something, because it got super sticky, like molasses candy or something, and almost glued my mouth shut. Pretty bad. If it was actually a sryup it would have been better, but I still wouldn't try again, because I don't think that strawberries need that much sweetness - it kind of overpowers the berries. Maybe if I had bad quality strawberries I'd try it.

I loved this little recipe! My husband and I celebrated last nite, and as a little touch, I added a layer of sweet rasberries with strawberries. Talk about nice! Came out awesome..And to boot, we had a glass of champagne with the dessert, so I dropped a little rasberry and a little slice of strawberry to the glasses of champagne, and it was simply DIVINE!!! He loved it, and it was a great hit. I did as the recipe called for, and to speed up the cooling, I placed the bowls of the fruit in the freezer, so the syrup carmelized the fruit very nicely. Thanks so much! It is a keeper for the holidays! :)

I made this recipe tonight for my husband and me, and we both found it equally unappealing. I used the required ingredients, only cut down on the sugar and used about 3/4 cups, and it still tasted horribly sweet. The sweetness of this was incredibly disturbing, and even the sour taste of the strawberries did not help at all. I am a huge fan of cinammon, but it really did not work in this case with all the sugar.

Very different, but delicious.  Great on ice cream, but I prefer them alone!

Excellent! Very simple but very tasty. The only change that I made was to double the cinnamon because I absolutely LOVE cinnamon. I also served it over vanilla ice cream with sliced fresh strawberries. Delicious! This syrup would also taste excellent over many apple desserts and would offer a tasty autumn flavour. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this was something! I wasn't sure I'd like it just reading the recipe, but when I poured it over ice cream (with the strawberries of course) the layers of flavor really popped! Nicely done, thanks!

DELICIOSO!!! Can't wait till hubby comes home to try it

Pretty good. I can understand how the flavor of the nutmeg can be off putting to some.  As far as I know, I followed the recipe, only I substituted Splenda for Baking for sugar.  When I first tried the syrup, it was strong, but I let it cool off and let the strawberries marinate, and it was fine.  Good flavor. I plan to pour the berries over cheesecake tomorrow.  Tonight I'm eating it with a bit of whipped cream - a nice compliment.

I didn't really care for this recipe ... SO sweet!  WAY sweet!  The spices were fine and all that, but I think at least half the sugar would have been fine ... possibly more than half!  Maybe with some tweaking it would be a 5-star for us, but I doubt I'll try it again.

Excellent taste.  I made a half batch and used only 1/3 cup sugar. A little tricky if you've never made syrup before but worth the learning.

This was different. Didn't care for it to much.  Something in it was too much but, couldn't figure out what. It wasn't horrible but, will not be making this again. Sorry

Quick and easy to prepare.  I will cut back on the sugar as we thought it was very sweet using fresh picked berries.  Served with french vanilla ice cream and crushed graham crackers.

This was sooooo AWESOME.  Made it for my husband's birthday (he insisted on having NO cake... but said this was better than anything he could've asked for!).  Served over vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries, as mentioned by previous reviewer.  LOVED IT!!!  Can't wait to make it again!!

Not sure I made this correctly.  This is a bit outside of my normal cooking--not a big syrup fan, so I had a bit of trouble.  I may have overcooked it, because it was a bit grainy.  It was good with ice cream, and it helped rescue some strawberries, but I'd have to try it again to be sure I'm doing it right. I do like the spices in it--regular syrup just doesn't do it for me.

This just didn't work for us.  Husband thought it tasted like cough syrup.  I boiled it for 12 minutes, and sugar still remained crystalized.

After searching long and hard for a good strawberry shortcake recipe, I stumbled across this for the sauce to pour over top and WOW it was sooooo good! As with most recipes, I take two or three that I like and combine - I ended up blending some strawberries in a blender and adding it to the sauce as well as adding some sliced strawberries to the sauce right before it was done to soak up the sauce a bit, but not become soggy. I also used Splenda in place of sugar and it worked good.

Huge hit at our housewarming party.  It was requested for me to bring to the graduation party 2 weeks later.  Kids loved it.  Topped it with whipped topping.  I had double the batch and I think I got 1 strawberry out if it.  Went fast!

Knock-you-to-your-knees goodness!  And so versatile, too!  It would be delicious with so many types of fruit, you can have it year-round.  Excellent with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Serving it on top a slice of shortcake, pound cake, sponge cake, or angel cake is entirely optional (but it soaks up the extra syrup and fruit juices for a good distribution of flavor).

Wow great recipe. This made a wonderful topping to ice cream.. Had a little extra left and used it  the next day again and it seemed to have more flavor after it marinated for a day.. Definitely will make this again..
