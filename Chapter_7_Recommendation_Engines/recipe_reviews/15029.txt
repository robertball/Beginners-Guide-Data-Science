I've been using this recipe for about 5 years, and it's always a hit. I double it and bake it in a bunt pan. Fantastic.

This is a wonderful coffee cake!  I too opted for the brown sugar instead of the confectioners.  Also used light sour cream.  The batter is very thick so it's a little difficult to spread especially when spreading the final layer atop the crumb mixture.  But it turns out incredibly moist and LIGHT!  Checked it at 35 minutes... let it cook 5 more and it was perfect.  Cooled for 10 minutes before cutting.  I'll be making this again!

WONDERFUL recipe! I put in about 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to make it a bit more moist.  Also- mix the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture with some melted butter to form a soft crumble.  I put some of the crumble in the bottom of a bundt pan, then 1/2 the batter, then more crumble, then the rest of the batter.  Baked it for 55 minutes- it came out beautifully and it was a big hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I quadrupled this recipe for 10 teenagers staying at my house and baked it in 2 9X13 pans. Delicious!  Moist! Easy! - I did add a bit more sour cream than called for. I also had trouble smoothing the top layer over the crumbly middle (which I used 1/2 XX sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, cinnamon and no nuts). The TIP: wet fingers often to smooth top layer of batter - works perfect!

Outstanding! I substituted brown sugar for the powedered sugar and it turned out great. However, I was horrified to see the amount of fat in each serving so I modified the recipe a little more the second time. I substituted low-fat plain yoghurt for the sour cream. Wonderful results!

BEST Coffee Cake EVER! And I don't mean the best coffee cake I have ever made, because this is the first coffee cake I've ever made, but best coffee cake I've ever TASTED.  Wow! I too added an extra 1/4 cup of sour cream (for a total of 1 1/4 cups) and doubled the cinnamon mixture for a thicker layer inside. For the cinnamon mixture, I omitted the nuts, since I didn't have any that were fresh, swapped brown sugar for confectioner's sugar, and added 1 tbsp of dark corn syrup to help the mixture stay a little gooey once the cake was cool.  I checked the cake after 30 minutes and cooked it for a total of 45 minutes.  Then once the cake was cooled for 15 minutes, I glazed it with a mix of confectioner's sugar, a little water, and a drop of lemon extract. Delicious!! The boyfriend was thrilled, too!  I will make this recipe again and again. Thanks, Sal!

This cake is easy to make and tastes great! I substitute butter, sour cream for vegetable oil and non fat yogurt respectively. It's still moist and taste wonderful. I'm sure I will bake this cake again.

I thought this was pretty good.  I just wasn't crazy about the confectioner's sugar.  Next time, I will try it with the brown sugar instead.  I baked mine in a 2 qt baking dish and an hour was too long, the cake was too dry.  45 min. would be sufficient.

Wonderfully tastey and very easy to make! This coffee cake is a family favorite! I use brown sugar instead of powder sugar, and I sometimes use plain or vanilla flavored yogurt in place of the sourcream depending on what I have on hand.

Nice texture and flavor.   Personally, I think it needs no icing, especially as a cake to eat with coffee.  I used margarine instead of butter.  Did a little something different with the cinnamon filling:  I used brown sugar and cinnamon and mixed the butter (margarine) in with the beaters I mixed the cake batter with.  Added a large dollop of the cake batter to form a thick cinnamon batter.  I used a bundt pan (greased) and put down a layer of the cake batter, made a little trough with my spatula and put in the cinnamon batter, then covered it with remaining cake batter.  Baked for 45 minutes at 350 in the bundt pan.

This cake did impress my workmates for morning tea - they loved it!!! A definite keeper. I also used low fat sour cream and brown sugar in the topping and cooked in an 8x8" pan for allotted time.

Warning! This cake will ruin your diet! Amazing! in one word.  Since I am Jewish, and I wanted the cake to be a dessert for Shabbos, I used an apple sauce instead of the sour cream. (Since we don't mix meat with dairy). Also tried it with Better then cream cheese. Came out amazing. The only trouble is, it interferes with my diet. My husband loved it. Since he likes crunchy nuts, I used a cup of coursely sliced almonds. Used 13X9 Alluminum pan. I put the nuts mixture on top, and used organic brown sugar, instead of conf. Definately will try again!

This cake makes frequent appearances on the breakfast buffet at my  B&B- the only substitution is plain yogurt with a touch of milk for the sour cream as I cannot find sour cream in Italy and the addition of fresh fruit (apples, peaches, nectarines, etc.) to the middle layer of streusel filling. It is always well received by guests.

This was in a church cook book that I purchased twenty years ago.  My family has enjoyed it every time that I make it.  Very rich, very moist and very good.  I would spray a bundt pan with pam and after it was baked I would carefully removed it from the pan (flip over) and then drizzled white sugar frosting just to add more calories.  One of our favorites.  Think I'll make one today!

Great flavor.  I doubled the recipe for my 9x13 pan.  When I added all of that flour, it was really, really stiff.  I added a 1/2 cup of buttermilk to loosen it and make it spreadable.  It was still a pretty dry cake.  I will try to tweak it a bit next time - less flour, I think.  I also added 1/2 t of salt to give the flavors some dimension.  Used brown sugar instead of confectioners sugar.  I will add a crumble topping next time.  Definitely worth making again.

This cake is bad news! You won't be able to stop eating it! I doubled the recipe and it is half way gone! The only change I did was brown sugar instead of confectioner's and I added a little bit of milk to the batter (it was so thick, I was afraid the cake would have been dry had I not added the milk). No need for worries! The cake is delicious! Wonderful buttery flavor and moist, very moist! I'll  keep on baking it! It is wonderful!

Excellent.  Used half a cup of fat free sourcream and half regular.  Very moist and light. Has become a favorite. Definitely use the brown sugar instead of the confectioner's sugar. Got rave reviews at the office.

This recipe was fantastic!!!! I altered it just a little bit by using brown sugar instead of confection sugar, I used 1 1/3 cup of sour cream, and I dripped melted semi-sweet chocholate on top. My family inhaled it. This one is a must make!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I decided to give this recipe a try this morning. I used brown sugar instead of the confectioners sugar, as others had suggested. I also added a bit extra of sour cream as other suggested as well. It was moist, tasty and pretty simple to whip out as I was half awake sipping my coffee. I think next time I will try the original amount of sour cream, it was alittle too moist in my opinion.

I have tried many coffe cake recipes over the last few years to try to find the one I remember eating as a kid.  This one is the best.  I used brown sugar as the topping and it was perfect with coffee!  A real winner.

This cake is AWESOME! I put all the batter into a 9x13" pan, and then sprinkled with 1/2 of nut mix. Then I made a 2nd batch of batter, and spread over the top. To the remaining nut mixture I added 1 Tbs cinnamon, 1 Tbs powdered sugar, and 1 Tbs brown sugar, and covered the top of batter with it. I also increased melted butter to 4 Tbs. , and drizzeld generously all over the top of the cake before baking. I found that an hour was a little long, so it should be checked at abot 35-45 minutes. This bakes up very thick, and is soooo good!

This recipe is wonderful! I loved it! For so long I looked for a coffee cake recipe that reminded me of an elementary school breakfast. I found it! I took the suggestions as others did and used brown sugar instead of confetioners sugar, and added cinnamon to the mix. I thought the mix wasn't enough, so I doubled the mix. I cooked it uncovered for 50 mins, then lightly covered it for an additional 45 mins. It turned out great. It had a wonderful smell of cinnamon. Great with coffee.

I have been looking for a great coffee cake recipe and this one is a hit.  Even my son who is the pickiest of eaters liked it. I reduced the baking time to about 40 min as recommended by other reviewers.  I probably could've reduced the time by another 5 min.

A hit in our household... didn't have any walnuts available, so substituted them with a nutty cereal ...  

Moist, flavorful, easy to make, and better than most!  Yum.

i was surprised by how great this recipe turned out.  i had a large amount of organic sour cream that i needed to use up and wanted to make a sour cream pound cake with dried apricots but was unable to find my recipe so i decided on this. the texture is really nice.  however i do agree with others about the sweetness.  it could be a little more sweet but to me it was perfect because i tend to cut down the sugar in most recipes.  i made it last night and it seems to taste better this morning.  i cut off a piece and mircrowaved it for about 30 seconds and couldn't help but have a second serving.  i used unsalted butter only because it is an old habit from culinary school and added about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt.  i also creamed the sugar and butter together first before adding the eggs.  it makes it a lot easier.  i'll make another one for the coworkers tonight but this time i'll use brown sugar instead of the powdered sugar for the nut mixture.

Good stuff! Next time I will probably double the nut mixture, and a little bit extra sour cream (2T maybe).

I made some alterations, though.  First, I left out the wallnuts to make it kids-friendly.  I also spread the dough in two pans - as described in a recipe in one, and a thin layer in the other. Both had different baking times.  One turned out soft and moist and the other was more crunchy, but both were very good.  I served some confectioners sugar mixed with cinnamon on the side and this was a very popular topping.  Everyone loved the treat.  I will definitely make it again.

Good cake.  A little sweet, but we like it.  I use brown sugar instead of the confectioners.  Good basic coffee cake.  Thanks.

My biggest disappointment was not getting to eat that much of it - my boyfriend and roommate gobbled it all up! 

I used brown sugar instead of confectioner's sugar, and veggie oil instead of butter after reading the reviews here and it turned out great. Very yummy.

Also I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's all I had lying around, and it was just as yummy! Next time I make this I will probably use both pecans and walnuts.

ok, full disclosure here, we made a number of changes

First, we halved the batch for my small family, and cooked it in the toaster oven in a small round cake pan.  Also, we are cutting down on our sugar, and since coffee cake is overly sweet to balance coffee, I often find i can cut the sugar in half.  I think that next time I will only cut the white sugar in half, but only cut the powdered sugar by 1/4.
I did half whole wheat and half white flour.  And since we do not eat nuts around here, I substituted a 1/2 cup of crushed dried raspberries.

Overall, it was a great breakfast.

This was some of the best coffee cake I've ever had!  I substituted brown sugar for the confectioners sugar as well and used a little over a cup of light sour cream.  Everyone that tried it loved it.

This was wonderful!  I put the cake together the night before and put it in the fridge.  The next morning I took it out and let it sit for about an hour before baking it.  Then I served it warm to some gals at a meeting...everyone wanted the recipe!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, brown sugar instead of powdered sugar, and part yogurt (didn't have enough sour cream).  I also put 2 tablespoons of butter in the nut mixture and saved some to put on the top before baking!  I will keep this in my collection of favorites!

I really liked this recipe! The cake was moist and had just the right amount of sweetness (not too sweet, which I don't like). The house was filled with the smell of warm cinnamon... I make a cake or muffins every Sunday night for a quick breakfast my husband can grab in the mornings and he loved this cake.

Very nice and moist.  I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour and half white sugar and half brown sugar so the color was like honey.  You could not taste the wheat at all! I only had 3/4 cup of sour cream so I added a little heavy cream and milk for moisture.  It was difficult to spread(almost like a bread dough) but since it rose nicely and everyone loved it, I will have to make this again.

very good.  The whole thing was gone before it had a chance to cool completely.  I used brown sugar with cinnamon as the topping and cut out the walnuts.  I made it in a bundt pan, and it turns out 60 minutes is a little too long.  If making it in a bundt pan, I would check it at 50 minutes.

Great cake, everyone loves it. The only change I made was adding all the wet ingredients (except the melted butter) together before mixing it with the dry ingredients(not including the nut mixture).

In a word, delicious!  Since I'm not a big fan of walnuts, I simply replaced them with pecans.  The result was a really yummy cake which disappeared before I had a chance to take a second slice.  Highly recommended.

Some people say it is moist and some people say it is dry...  I was wondering which was true.  I like very moist cake even if I eat with a cup of coffee!  So, I tried to use 1/4 cup RICE FLOUR and 3/4 cup all purpose flour instead of 1 cup all purpose flour (by the way, I made this cake with just a half amount of the original.  I used 1-8x4x2in. pan, baked 45 min.)  It turned out so moist and delicious!!  I don't know if it's rice flour's magic or originally moist but you should try if you like very moist cake!  Also, I used brown sugar instead of confectioners' sugar as many people recommended.

Everyone loves this!  I made a few modifications: used brown sugar instead of powdered, used pecans instead of walnuts, and added about 1/8 cup of milk to the batter because it was really thick.

looks, smell and taste great! i love the cinnamon, sugar walnut mixture. MmMMm... variations: brown sugar for confectioner's sugar and plain yoghurt for sour cream. baked in a 10 inch pan for 40 mins. 1 hr is definitely too long.

I read this morning about the Jewish Coffee Cake and the reviews sounded great!! The mistake I made was forgetting everyone's comment about checking the cake after about 45 minutes!! I waited one hour and it was super dry!! I will try it again next weekend and will be careful to check it much, much sooner!!

This is a very rich, very tasty coffee cake. I used brown sugar instead of the powdered sugar for the topping, and one-half cup of walnuts instead of one cup, and it turned out wonderfully.

This was a very good basic coffee cake recipe.  I used the brown sugar instead of the powdered sugar like everyone recommended and it turned out great.  The only other tip I have is to watch you don't overbake this.  I only had mine in for 45 minutes and I thought it came out a bit dry.  I will make again, though.

This is easily one of THE BEST coffee cakes I have ever tried. I made it for my
parents for Christmas breakfast and we all loved it. But, I found that it finished
baking in less than the hour indicated in the recipe. Try checking it after 45 minutes.

Just made this and it's delicious.  I did make some of the changes that others suggested:
1.  BROWN sugar instead of confecitoners sugar, confectioners has to be a mistake)
2.  1 1/2 cups of sour cream
3.  Salt to both the cake and filling.
4.  I mixed the sour cream right into the mixed butter, sugar, egg vanilla mixture once the mixture had been thoroughly mixed, then added the dry ingredients.

I will definitely make this again.

Since we always try out new recipes on each other before guests my wife (the only baker in the family) made it for us the other night.  Absolutely loved it.  There was too much for the two of us so we gave a piece to a friend who also loved it.  The only change my wife made was to decrease the baking time to 50 minutes.  This is a great recipe that she will make when we have company.

Oops I forgot. We have always used cinnamon, white sugar and chocolate morsels. A layer in the center and another on top. All have nut allergies. If you like it on the sweeter side this is it. Enjoy!!!!

Double the amount of nuts, sugar, and cinnamon. Put half in the middle and half on top. Also, try baking in a Bundt pan, with the 1st half of the nut mixture on the bottom..

I doubled the recipe and baked in a bundt pan. I made a novice mistake and forgot to sprinkle the topping into the bottom (what becomes the top of the bundt pan) first. I used brown sugar instead of confectioners for the topping mix. I increased the sour cream by 1/4 cup (1/2 cup total since I doubled recipe) and it was moist. Since I goofed with the topping, I melted a little butter and mixed with cinnamon/sugar and drizzled it over the top after. It soaked in and tasted/looked great!

I liked the taste of the final product, but found the texture to be quite thick, bordering on heavy.  I am used to coffee cakes being rather light.  In addition, it rose while baking SO much that the top was dark brown before the middle was baked sufficiently - and this was with my oven being precisely calibrated for temp and having the rack directly in the middle.  I understand what the recipe is trying to accomplish, but I am looking for lighter recipe, and this one seemed a bit heavy handed.

This was excellent!  I used a cherry and blueberry filling in the middle and the streusel on top. The filling sank a good bit, so next time I will put about 2/3 of the batter in before the filling. I used a cup of nonfat Greek yogurt and added a half cup of lowfat sour cream.  The cake was done in about 45 minutes.

It was really good.  But based on the reviews, I used brown sugar instead of the confectioners sugar.  I also always use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  Yum!!

I increased the vanilla to a tablespoon and substituted brown sugar for the confectioner's sugar as per the advice of other reviewers. The flavor of the cake is lovely, but the cake itself turned out quite dry, even though I used an extra egg in the batter. I'm going to have to finagle this recipe a bit to get it perfect next time.

This is pretty good.  It is not overly sweet, it's relatively moist.  By baking in a 9x9 pan it doesn't look very pretty in terms of in the pan or serving a slice, and the top and edges get pretty browned by the time the center is done.   I used vegetable oil instead of butter.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayonnaise as that's what I had.  I added 1 tsp salt.  I used brown sugar instead of confectioners sugar in the crumble.  And I used pecans. It was done at about 50-52 mins.  Will make again but will use a bundt pan or some other decorative muffin-type tin, just worried the brown sugar filling will make it stick when you try to remove from pan.

LOVE this recipe! I added 3/4 tsp salt, used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream, and used a nut mixture of various roasted nuts, some of which were salted. I also used regular white sugar in the nut mix. SO GOOD. This recipe has become a family favorite.

The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it's very addicting! And brown sugar instead of the confectioner's sugar is definately the way to go!

Just the kind of coffee cake recipe I was looking for, and it tastes amazing too. Although next time I think I will try what other people suggested and use brown sugar instead of powder sugar. Yum!

I was going to make my great aunt's coffee cake for some company but didn't have a couple ingredients so i tried this.  i didn't even finish my piece.  my two guests did but i could tell by their faces that they were just being nice.  which was confirmed when my husband got home and tasted. not sure if i did something wrong or if i'm just comparing it to my aunt's recipe and it doesn't measure up.  would not make this again.

This cake is fantastic! The proportions are just right. I removed the nuts in the filling 'cos my family doesn't like nuts, and added just one tsp more vanilla essence. Cake came out moist and creamy. I also made a cream cheese frosting to spread on top. So the cake has to be kept in the fridge, but it tastes good both hot and cold! Will be making this again

Great taste!  This cake rated rave reviews from guests.  I made 1.5 times the filling recipe, and this turned out to be exactly right for the filling layers, with enough left over to sprinkle over the top of the cake.  This will be one of my "special occasion" choices again and again.

This was fabulous!  I did modify it based on the ingredients I had and it still turned out great.  I only had reduced fat sour cream (probably a good thing since it calls for so much butter).  I took the advice of others and used brown sugar for the filling.  I also didn't have walnuts and only a handful of almonds on hand.  I chopped up the almonds in the food processor and added about 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the mixture just for a little texture since I was low on nuts.  My husband ate the whole thing is a couple days and asked when I was making it again!  Can't wait to try it with walnuts!

This recipe was good.  I did not quite get the ribbon through the center of the cake partly because i did not have a bunt pan and quite honestly the cake itself is moist and tasty enough to do without the ribbon and just be sprinkled with cinnamon sugar or crumbs on top.  I also left out the sour cream and it was still moist.

Great cake!  I took the cake batter and gently folded in 2 cups of blueberries, followed by a light brown sugar topping on the top of cake.  I checked the cake after 40 minutes....and decided it needed 5 more minutes, as many other people have suggested.  Since I added fruit to the batter, I left it as written, as I wanted a stiffer cake batter.  Superb!  As with any cake, overworking the batter will develop the gluten in the flour, resulting in a dry cake.

WOW this was great!!!  I brought it in to my salon and it was gone in 15 min!  I used a loaf pan and was glad I did since it fell apart just a little when I took it out of the pan.  Also added some brown sugar to the filling.  YUM YUM!!

This is perfect. I accidently added an extra cup of flour, so I had to add 2 cups of sour cream and it still came out perfect. For the filling, I used brown sugar and I mixed everything together with the melted butter and then put that in the middle and on the top. Fabulos warm, nice and moist. Will definitley make again!

Made for co-workers & received rave reviews. Some changes: eliminated nuts, used sweet butter and 1/2 tsp. Kosher salt, substituted light brown sugar for confectioners'. Not too sweet, light moist and delish! Thanks, Sarah

Wow, after reading all the great comments, I expected more!  The cake itself was pretty bland and was very hard to spread.  Replaced the powdered sugar with brown sugar but really was not all that tasty.  The cook time is way off, mine took a little over 30 minutes.  Edible but would not make again.

Excellent!  Very moist and just the right blend of spices.  I have also added 1 cup of cinnamon chips to the first layer of the Cinnamon/Sugar/Nut mix.  I don't add it to the top, as the chips go hard.  As other's have stated, 40 minutes was the right amount of baking time.

Mmmm. This is probably the best coffee cake I've had in a long time. 40 minetes was enough time for this to be done. It came out moist and delish. Tastes way better with the brown sugar swap out instead of the confectioners. Another keeper.

I am a pretty hopeless cake maker, but this turned out well. The flavor was good, the texture was nice and light, but I thought it was rather dry - it definitely needs to be eaten with tea/coffee/milk. Thanks, Sarah!

Excellent. Best coffee cake recipe on this website. I've made this several times for friends and family & everyone loved it. I used pecans instead of walnuts and brown sugar in place of 10X. Served warm and lightly buttered is best!  Thanks for  keeper.

Delicious recipe! If you are in the mood for something with a indulgent cinnamon taste but without the unecessary sweetness (and calories) of frosting, you need to try this one! Amazing!

Delicious coffe cake! Despite what other said, I found this cake to be perfectly sweet. I wouldn't add any more sugar or decrease the amount called for. It came out very moist, I definitely will be making this one again!

Really good,  I too had trouble with the nut mixture not sticking together, I'll try mixing with batter next time as suggested. I used a bundt pan and it turned out great also I added some brown sugar and fresh ground nutmeg in the nut mix and it was wonderful.  I just made it and I can't wait to have a piece with my morning coffee.

My cake is in the oven as I write this so I'm not sure how it will come out.  I have a suggestion about mixing: add half the flour mixture, then half the sour cream then the remaining flour, then the remaining sour cream.  This will allow for better mixing without over doing it! I will check the cake after 40 minutes!  Oh I also added a little salt.

Baking time is WAY too long, 40-45 min tops, needs more sour cream, but otherwise a simple and very good coffee cake.

I follwed the other reviews and used brown sugar and made a struesal type topping, you really need to watch the cooking time I baked for 45 minutes and it was a little dry will make again and shorten the baking time.

This was good.  I replaced the powdered sugar with brown sugar like others did, and since I was out of nuts I used a 1/2 cup coconut for the filling and topping.

This cake was amazing! I have never made a sour cream cake before, but thought I'd try it for my sisters birthday. It was a hit, and I was begged to re-make it the next day!!!

I used brown sugar in the topping - a bit more than what was called for.  I baked it in an 8 x 8 x 2 pan for 35 min.  EASY, TASTY!!  Nice to eat something homemade & not take forever to make.

I couldn't give it to the kids because of the nuts.

I’ve made this several years with a few  slight modifications.  To make the cake more moist, I use  1 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup of vanilla Greek yogurt.  I also use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, instead of 1 cup white sugar.  Lastly for the  topping I substitute brown sugar for the powdered sugar.  It’s always a huge hit.

I added One Heaping Tablespoon of Cinnamon, instead of the Listed amount, I added Halves and Pieces of Walnuts instead of Chopped Walnuts, and I used Half a Cup of Stevia Granules instead of a Whole Cup of White Sugar, also I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Melted Butter which was the Last Thing before this Jewish Coffee Cake went into Our Oven.

This is a great recipe! Super delicious, light, fluffy and flavorful. I substituted plain yogurt for sour cream, which was great too! I also made the cinnamon mixture with sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and melted butter to make a crumble. It turned out great! I double the recipe and got a loaf pan, 6 muffins and a 9x9! Highly recommend!

This was easy to make and good to eat. I used pecans instead of walnuts for personal preference. Not as moist as I'd hoped but still a good cake.

So very good! 1 and a half of the recipe fills up a 9x13 pan with thick pieces of cake. Next time I'll press the nuts gently into the top, so they don't fall off when I cut it.

Excellent cake but altered the recipe a little.
Used 2 cups of sour cream
2 teaspoons of baking powder
Added 1 tsp. of salt
Used brown sugar with the cinnamon and put the melted butter in that mixture.
Cooking time decreased to 40-45 minutes.
My friends want the recipe!

Substituted Strawberry Banana Yogurt and Light Cream in place of Sour Cream which sweetens and moistens the cake. Added cut up apples in center of the cake along with a regular sugar and cinnamon mixture (no confectioners sugar) and it turns out so good your going to devour it quickly!

Delicious!  I followed some review advice:  double recipe & add a little more sour cream for moistness, sprinkle cinn/brown sugar (instead of other & I didn't use nuts) on bottom of bundt pan.  I ran low on butter, so I folded in some Trader Joe's pumpkin butter.  There is that hint of pumpkin in the taste & I plan to serve slices with a dollop of that pumpkin butter on the side.  The batter is very thick, I would lighten it out if I made it again, but the taste is good!  I made a little extra to make a few muffins with the same cinn, etc. on bottom technique.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family and I were delighted at the quality of this recipe. It was made for breakfast and seconds were requested.

The only change I made was in the topping. I did not use the walnuts and I doubled the confectioner's sugar and cinnamon, replacing the walnuts with half a cup of brown cane sugar. I think a little more melted butter for the top would be nice because some of the sugar mixture was not covered in it and did not harden. 

Overall, this was a nice recipe.

I absolutely love this oh my god!! It's so moist and delicate. Yet it's crunchy with walnuts and chocolate chips! I put my own twist to this by using coffee, and mint abstract, instead of vanilla abstract. So there is an after taste or mocha frappe mint. My tastebuds are in pure heaven!!

Great recipe. It turned out super moist! I only had a half cup of sour cream on hand, so I subbed some ricotta. Only baked it for 45 min, and it was very much done. If I change anything next time I might add a crumble on top.

I love this cake. For the topping, I just make it with brown sugar and cinnamon, and add it like they recommended.

Delicious cake! The only thing that I did was substitute vanilla yogurt for the sour cream.  It is a perfect balance between moist and dry.

Delishous. I added about an extra 1/4 cup of source am and the cake was nice and moist. Also, I did the brown sugar instead of powdered sugar filling and made extra if it so there was more in the cake. It was a big hit!

When I think "coffee cake" I tend to think of a bundt cake, which is my preference.  Anyway, I made this recipe and then realized it was to go in a 9x9  pan.  (I usually use that size pan for brownies)  So, I had to make another 1/2 recipe to fill up the pan adequately.  Also, I prefer granulated sugar to the confectioners sugar, so I used that for the topping and interior swirl.  In addition, I put the topping in first (in the bundt pan) and then added the batter, added a layer of cinnamon mixture, and another layer of batter.  I do like the flavor of the batter.

This was amazing as is. I was planning on subbing Greek Yogurt for the sour cream but it was expired. So I used one cup of sour cream ( all I had left), and two of the kids portion cups of applesauce. It worked out perfectly and the texture and saturation was excellent! This is a definite winner, thank you so much!!! Anyone who has made this with part whole wheat, I'm interested to hear your results! I also doubled this recipe and baked in a 13x9 for just under an hour.

It was delicious - better than another recipe I have for Jewish Coffee Cake.  The only difference - which iI do  with a lot of recipes - I substituted mostly plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream because I was out of sour cream.  I didn't have enough plain yogurt so I finished the needed 1 cup with coconut Greek yogurt since it doesn't have fruit in it so is smooth like plain yogurt.  Hope that makes sense.  If I would have had sour cream I would have used it.  Very Good!

great coffee cake. I was looking for one that had sour cream because they always turn out the best. Batter was soft and creamy yellow. Didn't have nuts so just put a layer of brown sugar and cinnamon in the middle. My family loved it

I tried this for the first time Easter morning. It was a big hit! My son doesn't like nuts but likes the flavor so I used ground walnuts in the topping. It turned out really well. I also cooked it on a bundt pan for just 40 minutes

We run a bed and breakfast. I've made this cake perhaps 50 times. It is fantastic. Like many (take the hint) I subbed brown sugar for the powdered. I add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I doubled the vanilla and added 1/2 teaspoon of butter extract. I would check it at 50 minutes. I loosely put a piece of foil over the top for the last 10 minutes.

Absolutely awesome! I had to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream (I cant seem to find it here in UAE) and it came out excellent! I have made it twice now and I have had nothing but rave reviews. Its not too sweet which is a huge plus for those who dislike like traditional sweets and cakes. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe went together beautifully! I opted for brown sugar instead of the confectioners sugar and did not put in walnuts to satisfy picky kids. 
For a nice thick and tall coffee bundt cake, I doubled the recipe and it worked perfectly :)

This was a very nice coffee cake that had a nice buttery flavor and moist texture.  I did add a little salt, but still the cake lacked a little something.  I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it still was quite good.

I had high hopes for this based on the reviews. I made it for overnight guests and it was just okay. I thought the cake part lacked something and was on the dry side. You definitely have to have something to drink with it. I even added a 1/4 cup more sour cream as many suggested and took it out of the oven at 55 minutes. Maybe I was just expecting something different.

I revised this because I do wheat free and  dairy free cooking.  Also cut back on the sugar and butter and it turned out great.  I used 1/2 cup of sweet potato (can) or you can use apple sauce instead of butter.   Instead of sour cream I used soy yogurt, and I used my own GF flour mix.

Didn't have a 9x9 pan so used a 9x13. There wasn't enough crumble and batter for two full layers, but it still turned out delicious. Just reduced baking time to ~35-40min. Cake was moist and not too sweet.

Very moist and thick! I didn't bother with the filling; just sprinkled a mixture of butter, brown sugar, and chopped walnuts on top. Only baked it about 35 minutes. Excellent!

Wowza! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using brown sugar as others reviewers suggested. This is one phenomenally moist cake with a wonderfully tasty topping. I think this is one of the best recipes I have ever found on this site. Thank you so much Angie!

I will need to be very, very careful around this cake when I make it again. Absolutely delicious and great with a dark, bold coffee and some cold, sweet fruit like peaches or berries!

Excellent. The cake flew, didn't last long. Even my nephews ate it all. The change I made was brown sugar instead of powdered sugar.

is a pretty nice cake. wasnt as easy to pour into the pan to bake, was a bit heavy...but luckily it turned out ok.  i wish i had used brown sugar instead of confectioners as many have suggested here. the confectioners looked creepy on top of the cake.  i also added some mixed frozen berries to the middle walnut mixture and it gave it a bit of tang.

Very delicious, moist coffee cake. The cake itself is not too sweet.  I made a few changes to suit my husbands' request for a coffee cake that tastes like a cinnamon roll. I didn't have nuts and used brown sugar instead of confectioner's for the filling. I made it in a loaf pan. And after it came out of the oven I put a streusel on top (over the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter).

Wonderful moist texture. Would have been even better with more cinnamon. I think I'll have to try it with jam for the filling.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I took a lot of suggestions from the reviews so it changed the recipe a bit! But overall great recipe....fantastic recipe with the following changes (using yogurt instead of sour cream and 1 1/4 cup yogurt) and cinnamon instead of powdered sugar.... and that's it! 5 stars!

This was very good. I did what other reviewers did and used brown sugar instead of powdered sugar. I also doubled the amount of brown sugar mixture (and added a little butter)because I like a nice thick inner layer and crumble on top. It is a little hard to spread but once it is in the oven it all evens out. Thought this was great and will definitely make this again!

I'm going to try not to ever make this again.  I ate the whole thing in a day.   I made a few changes to the recipe.  I omitted the nuts since my family doesn't like them (not that it mattered, since they barely got any!!!) and I accidentally mixed the melted butter in with the brown sugar (instead of powdered) & cinnamon mixture.  I had to drop & "swirl" it around the top of the middle & top layers of the cake to spread it around (somewhat). But it ended up looking marvelous & marbled.  I didn't like the top after everything was done so I mixed some powdered sugar, water & vanilla & made a drizzled topping that was a perfect compliment.  VERY MOIST indeed.... I will try never to make again ;-)

Fantastic coffee cake.  Not too sweet, easy to make..I'd been using another recipe for years but this one is more calorie kind than  the old  recipe and nothing was lsot in the taste. I did add a bit more of the filling ingredients for a more satisfying taste experience.

I have no idea what makes this cake Jewish, but it is very tasty and easy.  Like other reviewers, I omitted the nuts, used brown sugar instead of confectioners, and shortened the baking time to around 45 minutes.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon/sugar, although I ended up using not quite all of the doubled amount.  I inadvertently doubled the melted butter to 4 Tbl (because I didn't carefully preread the recipe and I thought the butter would get mixed with the cin/sugar).  This was actually a tasty mistake - the cake was extremely moist with a nice crunchy topping.

I thought this cake needed more sugar.  I substituted brown sugar for the white powdered.  I'm going to add a 1/4 cup more white sugar to the dough and mix the brown sugar with a tblsp of powdered sugar for the topping.  This cake is very moist so i will make it again with the noted changes.  I'll get back to you on how it came out.

This is practically the recipe i grew up with my mom making except for the topping we use 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 granulated white sugar with the cinnamon and  nuts. I personally dont use the nuts and its still a wonderful recipe! We also do this recipe in a bundt pan, i like the presentation better. the hardest part is getting it out in one piece.

Real nice texture.  I changed (like others) the powdered sugar to brown and then added sliced almonds to the top and fresh blueberries to the mix.

I omitted the nuts without changing anything else about the recipe.  1 hour was too long in my oven- next time i'll take it out after 45 min- but it was still an excellent coffee cake that I will make again and again!

It was ok, just not what I was looking for. 

I'll try again, next Christmas, but next time try it with brown sugar, some raisins, and some confectioner's sugar glaze.

I halved the recipe and added a couple spoonfuls more sour cream than the recipe calls for. Baked for about 40 min in a 9x4 loaf pan. It turned out quite moist and light. Can't wait to try it again! Thanks for sharing!

I skipped the powdered sugar and did the brown sugar/ cinnamon mix because that's what I know. Didn't use any nuts because I didn't have any. My daughter did the mixing  and when I checked it seemed a bit to thick in consistency to me so I added extra vanilla and some milk until I thought it was okay. Other than that, it came out fine. I have had better but I will try again.

Very moist, great taste, & looks pretty. I love that  with this recipe I may experiment with different "fillings ". Only problem, it didn't take as long to cook as the recipe says, and the recipe says to touch the cake and if it bounces back it's done. DONT DO THAT IT WILL BURN YOU!

thanks Sarah
This cake is delicious.
Next time I will mix small part cake mix with the nut mixture so that it sticks together better. I used crushed nuts, hazel meal and some sliced almonds. Next time will try with brown sugar instead as well. the butter was quite salty so that gave it an extra flavour in the mouth as you took a bite. Will make it a staple for visitors and work lunches.

I used half all purpose flour and half 80/20 whole wheat flour and soy flour mix.
I also used pecans and 2 teaspoons baking powder no soda because that is what I had.  Everyone loved it.   Pretty easy to make and stayed fresh two days beyond the day I made it.

The younger crowd felt this needed something else as the cake was fairly bland.  It was not a very sweet cake and my grandmother was the only one who really liked it.

I cut the sugar in half and substituted extra flour for the nuts in this recipe. It came out really well.

Brought back memories from childhood.  The only thing I would do different is make more to topping!

I didn't have nuts so I used apples instead.  I also mixed some apple into the cake.  It was delicious!!

No need to spread melted butter over the top -- cake is very rich without it.  I baked for 40 minutes (1 hr. is way too long)  Also, I used brown sugar instead of powdered and dusted the cake with powdered after if came out of the oven for a pretty lookng cake.

This is the best recipe yet! I am making it again for a school fundraiser/bake sale. It is moist, delicious, and absolutely perfect. I even served it as a dessert the second day after baking it. Wonderful!

I also used brown sugar in place of the powdered sugar with good results.  I even think you could half the topping amounts (nut mixture) and only sprinkle it on the top instead of putting some in the middle AND on the top. There was no need to drizzle the melted butter on the top. If desired- you could simply cut in a small amount of cold butter into the nut mixture and sprinkle it over the top that way.  It will produce a crumbly topping.  I do this on most of my recipes that call for streusel toppings.  Baked mine in an 8x8 pan for 45 minutes with good results.  An hour would have been too long.

This was too dry for my taste and there was not enough flavor to it compared to other coffee cakes I have tried

Wonderful recipe-- I got my Jewish friends' approval! They said that it's just like Mom's recipe. I also used brown suger instead of confectioner's suger. plus the amount of sour cream should be more. (even though I used smaller pan: 8x 8.5, I feel the dough is not enough)

My husband loves coffee cake, and he loved this one for sure!!  Instead of icing sugar though, I used brown sugar and the taste was great!
