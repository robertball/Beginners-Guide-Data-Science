I like to experiment and add this and that, and while this recipe is wonderful just as it is, you can still play with it. First...I don't use wine vinegar, but white vinegar works just fine.  Also, instead of just green pepper, I use 1/2 each red, yellow and green.  Makes it very colorful.  Also, try adding sliced mushrooms, sliced water chestnuts or bamboo shoots...and definately double the sauce!  I serve this over Egg Fried Rice which you can also find the recipe for here, and it is a meal people won't soon forget.   Just a great recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It had a nice flavor a little sweeter then I anticipated.The only thing I did differently was shorten the cooking time and cut back on the oil. There is no need to cook the pork that long. I served it over rice.

This was a fantastic recipe and the fact that it was so simple just made it even better. However I did make a few changes: I used fresh chopped garlic and ginger instead of garlic salt and ground ginger. This made it taste even more oriental and with a much more refreshing taste. And instead of using gravy mix, I just added two tsp corn starch (dilluted in water) and added this while the liquid is simmering in the wok/pan.  This recipe is now a staple in my kitchen and will keep on making it for years to come!

We all liked it, even the picky eaters.  I added a can of drained water chestnuts which was nice, bamboo shoots or bean sprouts would be a good addition as well.  My husband said he thought it could have used more sauce, but my son and I thought it was just right by the original recipe.

Awesome dinner idea!  We used a whole green and red pepper chopped and took the advice by adding some bamboo shoots.  We served over rice...we were all delighted with this dish.  Can't wait to pass this one on to my mom!  Thanks Christine!

Delicious! I, too, doubled the sauce and served over sticky rice. I also used leftover pork sliced thin and cut back on the cooking time to keep the vegetables crisper. I'll definitely use this one again. Thanks.

This was both excellent and easy!  With 4 young children it can be hard to find something all will like.  But I found it in this recipe.  Served over white rice this dish is a great mid-week delight.  I even made the sauce a day before and it turned out great.

Yum is right!  This is a keeper.  Didn't have pork loin so I used pork steaks and cut them into cubes. After browning the pork I poured off excess grease. Used low salt(lite) soy sauce and served this over unsalted white rice and it came out great.  Next time I'll add some pineapple chunks along with with the green pepper and onion. Pork was so tender.  Thanks Christine Johnson!!

Great flavor in the sauce, but cooking the pork that long made it much too tough.  I doubled the sauce as some suggested, and added in extra vegetables, and it was still too much sauce.

Kids loved it ... husband thought it was too "sweet-and-sour-ish."  As for me, I liked the balance, but did opt for lower sodium dry gravy and garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  Soy sauce does enough.  I also cut the pepper into larger chunks and opted for half red and half green pepper and sweet onion.  I'll make it again ... perhaps, though, prepare at a slower simmer so that the pork ends up a little more moist.

Delicious!  I had to substitute onion soup mix for gravy mix and red wine for red wine vinegar cause I didn't have the called for ingredients.  I also didn't add onion since I used the soup mix. I ended up cooking too long and the veggies became soggy.

Well, it was just ok. I cooked according to directions (plus added bamboo shoots, mushrooms). Pork was plenty tender; had to remove pork early and not simmer for 30 min, but only 15-20. Felt that the taste was slightly too ginger-ish and a little salty, although once put on sticky rice was much better. Next time I will use less ginger and a lower salt soy sauce.

The meat and sauce was excellent.  I doubled the liquid per other reviews, and cut back on garlic salt (used powder).  I had to spoon some liquid off after browning the pork.  I don't like peppers or onions so left them out, but added water chestnuts.  Next time, I would omit chestnuts and carrots, and serve broccoli and carrot medley on the side.  I would also cook the rice directly in the sauce, or let it soak in the rice overnight and eat as leftovers.

This was pretty good.  I made a few alterations...I used rice wine vinegar, fresh garlic, some pineapple, and substituted a cornstarch slurry instead of the gravy mix.  I also added a few tablespoons of Thai sweet chili sauce.  I also added my vegetables towards the end  so they would remain crisp.  Awesome over sticky rice!

The fiance really liked this one.  The only change I made was to use a red bell pepper in place of the green one.  Will definitely make again.

I thought the cooking time was way too long.  I sauteed the pork until a nice golden color, and only let the sauce simmer for about 7 minutes before adding veggies.  I didn't have carrots, so I threw in red, yellow, and green bell peppers.

The sauce is very, very good.  It got a thumbs up from my oldest DS.  There's not a lot of sauce, but that's how we like it.

Overall, it was a good recipe that we will make again.

This has really good flavor.  I didn't fry the meat as I am trying to cut calories.  I just laid the meat in a baking dish.  Poured the sauce over it, added a couple tablepoons of sesame seeds and baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes.   I did use rice vinegar and about a Tbls of ginger root in the sauce.  Feel free to double the sauce.    Serve this with garlic fried rice and your tastebuds will thank you for it.

This sauce was a nice variation for the chicken (I substituted) and white rice meals I like to make during the weekday every once in awhile. The gravy and honey combo worked, but I thought the sauce could have used a little bit more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Incredible flavor. The entire family loved it. I took some earlier advice, doubled the sauce recipe and added mushrooms, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and red peppers. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. Put it over rice and gobbled it up. Thank you for the recipe!!

Good recipe.  My husband and I made it for dinner last night and he absolutely loved it.  However, after I started making it, I realized I was out of bell pepper.  This recipe would have been amazing with the bell pepper.

I`ve made this dish w/variations for years with success! Cubed pork steak is a better and cheaper option. I use fresh garlic and ginger when I have it. I leave vinegar and some times honey out. Carrots are also an option. (I hate cooked carrots!) Different color peppers add  eye appeal.If you enjoy spice, add some. Add additional ingredients you enjoy. There is no excuse for no taste in this recipe! Add what you like, play w/it a bit, it is versatile!

Well, I'm sorry to say, but this recipe is not very good.  The ingredients sound ok, but it does not turn out in the end.  Neither my husband nor myself could take more than one bite.  Sorry...not recommended.

There's a restaurant in my town that serves this dish and I had a craving for it and found this recipe.  I took the advice of others by serving over fried rice (my own recipe), cubing the pork small, and adding some bean sprouts and a can of drained bamboo shoots. I didn't have wine vinegar so I used regular. I think it could use a little more sauce but that did not detract from the great taste! My boyfriend was so pleased with this dinner that I was rewarded with a big kiss and he did the dishes! Thanks Christine and allrecipes.com!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this dish.  I found the cooking times were less than stated - I used pork diced into 2cm cubes. It was really easy and will be going into my recipe file!

I have found my last minute  Asian pork recipe! I have been looking for one that doesn't require marinating and this was a hit with the family. For two pork tenderloin I tripled the sauce which made lots of liquid. I used two teaspoons of cornstarch instead of the  packaged brown gravy mix. It was delicious. I agree with the other reviewers that it doesn't take as much time as the recipe indicates. I added the onions and carrots much sooner so they could blend  into the sauce

Very tasty! The time for simmering is too long. Pork was done maybe 20 mins total, but I like it tender. Also used chicken broth instead of water. Added mushrooms watercress snow peas, essentially a medaly of stir fry veggies. Next time I'll add some crushed red peppers to give it a little heat.
Thanks for the recipe.

Lovely simple dinner. Slightly different from the Chinese take away version but in a good way. Just have to cook the Pork properly (don't over cook it).

I didn't have green pepper and it would have helped but it still wouldn't have been something I want to make again.  Sorry.  If I were to make it again, I think I would use 1/2 of the red wine vinegar.

Simple, diverse, to the point.  Husband loved it.  Served it with white rice.  Perfect Asian inspired dish.  Easy recipe to switch out the pork for chicken, beef or shrimp.

Delicious, I add some celery for added crunch, more ginger because I love the taste, and I highly recommend purple onions instead of white.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my leftover pork roast..and this was perfect~! The only change I made was leave out the ginger(I was out)..and add a dash of sesame oil. 
When I make this again, I'll double the green pepper and onion.~
DH said it needed more honey...but I thought it was sweet enough for me.
4 stars...because it needed more veggies..and I would have loved it.

This was good.  I sliced the meat and vegetables on a diagonal rather than cube and chop for better presentation.  I also added fresh broccoli that I had on hand and a bit more ginger.  I will definately make again, Thank You!

Great recipe.  Double the amount of sauce though so you will have some for your rice or noodles.

No a bad dish. The pork was very tender. We like things spicy so I added some hot peppers to get things going. The family really liked the dish. We will have it again.
