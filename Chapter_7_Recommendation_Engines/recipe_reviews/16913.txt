This recipe was to die for.  Everyone that ate it was raving about it.  For all you crock pot fanatics...I made this in the crock pot.  I prepared the dry rub as instructed and left in the fridge over night.  The next morning, I loaded all of the ribs into a big crock pot.  Then I prepared the BBQ sauce cold (no stove or oven work) and just poured it over the ribs.  Cooked in the crock pot on low for 10 hours.  They were incredible!

These ribs are amazing.  Being a true Texas boy, I love all things BBQ, all things pork, and all things spicy.  With this recipe, though, you need to customize the amount of cayenne for your audience.  I'm one to increase the amount of cayenne in any recipe, but in this one it was just right for me--which means that it would be too hot for some people.  There is too much sugar in the recipe unless you are cooking at least 3 racks of ribs--I would reduce it by half if cooking 1 or 2 racks.  Finally, there is no need to make the BBQ sauce.  The ribs are so flavorful that any BBQ sauce will be in the background.  I used a store brand sauce, and it was just fine.  The recipe is definitely one to try.  If you need more cayenne, then add it at the end.  UPDATE:  I finally decided to try the BBQ sauce in this recipe and wish I hadn't.  Even a generic store brand of sauce would be better than this sauce.  Don't waste your time on it.  Oh, and it makes enough for about 10 racks of ribs.

These were great, even though we didn't throw them on the grill due to rain. In the rub I used kosher salt and cut the black pepper to 1 1/2 Tablespoons.  I used 1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper in place of cayenne (LOVE the smoky flavor of chipotle peppers).  I would probably up the chipotle peppers if not cooking for children.  I used 1 1/4 tsp. ground chipotle pepper in the sauce.  My spareribs were St. Louis cut, which are just regular ribs with the breastbone and the adjacent strip of gnarled meat removed.  I think the ribs cook more evenly and are definitely easier to cut when done.  Mine were moist and tender after about 3 hours and I fear they might have dried out after any longer.  The best way I have found to test ribs for doneness is to pick up the center of the ribs  with tongs.  The ribs shoud flop down and a skewer inserted inserted between the ribs should meet little resistance (thank you chef Steve Johnson and Fine Cooking magazine).  My husband and daughter liked these better than ribs I have slaved over over.  This is an excellent, easy recipe!

Great, versatile recipe!  My husband used to work at a rib joint and is very choosy about his ribs - he said these were among the best - and to top it off, it was my first attempt at BBQ ribs!  I've used this recipe several times now and I love being able to tweak the rub ingredients (less pepper, more cayenne, etc.), depending on who's going to be eating them.  UPDATE: THis rub also makes for a *killer* pork roast and roasted chicken!  I use this rub so often now, I make a monster batch of rub about once a month and keep it in a huge canister on my kitchen counter so a couple scoops are always handy.

Wow! Really good! I am only rating the dry rub as I didn't bother with the sauce - the ribs were so moist and sticky that I didn't feel I needed it. I followed the recipe but only used 1/2 of the cayenne. It had a bite but wasn't really hot so I'll probably use more next time. Also, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Then I wrapped packages of 4-5 ribs in foil pouches and baked them all at about 250 for 3 1/2 hours. I unwrapped them and placed them on a rack (over a pan) in the same oven for about 30 minutes, to dry out a bit. So excellent and gooey! One big suggestion - this recipe makes ALOT! I cooked 8lbs of ribs, both pork and beef, and had fully 1/2 of the rub mix left. So I saved it in a ziplock and have used it twice more, on some boneless pork ribs, and spareribs. It'd be ashame to waste this rub so either make a smaller amount, or be prepared to store it for further use, (sprinkle it on - don't contaminate it with meat juices). This will be my dry rub from now on!

My mom and I invited my fiances family over for the first time (for my fiances b-day party) and we were nervous about the food. We used this recipe because it had so many great reviews. We put the rub on a day in advance and used masterpiece HOT AND SPICY BBQ sauce. We doubled the recipe and put 1/4 teaspoon canyanne pepper and 1 teasppon chili powder. The ribs were a hit they were so tender they were falling off the bone. Sweet and spicy, just delicious. Christopher's mom and grandma said that it was the best ribs they ever had in thier life. Thank you for the wonderful rib recipe.

I usually don't attempt ribs as they never turn out.  Well, those days are no more!  True, you do have to marinate for a long time (I did mine overnight) but they are very tasty.  This just takes a little planning ahead.  We cooked our five and 1/2 pound ribs for 3 and 1/2 hours total.  Thanks a bunch!

Made these twice for two large family gatherings in one week. Super easy and ribs can be done in two short steps:(1) Dry rub and wrap each rack in foil and marinate on cookie sheets or in roasting pan in fridge overnight. (Meat will leak).(2) Cook the ribs the next day. Toned down the spice of the rub  bc my family doesn't like overly spicy foods by only using about 2 scant teaspoons of ground black pepper. Also only used 2 TB of salt. Generously coated ribs with the rub, wrapped in foil and let marinate overnight. Still in foil, baked the ribs at 225 degrees for 4 hours. Because we were grilling other meats, finished the ribs in the oven. Removed the foil, poured Sweet Baby Ray's sauce liberally over the ribs and let finish in the oven at 325 for another 45- 60 minutes until ribs look brown and pull away from the bone and sauce is carmelized. Can re-cover with foil and keep in oven with temp. off until serving (I left about 30 minutes) -holds very well. Serve with more sauce if desired. All LOVED-including kids. Has replaced my previous rib recipe and is now in my "official" cookbook :)

Okay, this recipe is waaaay too spicy.  I am a big spicy person too.  It takes away the flavor from the pork and over powers it with sauce.  Additionally, it is too sweet and too salty.  This would make a good beef jerky rub sauce but not for pork ribs.

The sauce is good though.  The rub is  not.  I will not be making this again.

I suggest soaking the ribs in beer (Guinness).  My girlfriend (super hot) likes these ribs though.  She also is very nice and sweet.

OK people, I've used this site for years and have tried many, many recipes.  I became a member today just to comment on THIS rib rub.  In a word, outstanding!!  I followed the directions to a T, let the ribs sit overnight, cooked for 3 1/2 hours as instructed (turning twice to let the juices coat both sides, and didn't need any additional sauce.  Spicy enough to be noticed, but not so spicy that the kids we had over didn't devour them.   Had 16 folks for dinner and we all thought these were wonderful.  So good in fact, that I'm making another batch right now for tonight.  Double yum!

We are from Texas and miss our favorite bbq places more than anything else. I have been searching for a good recipe like this to spring on my husband and have made them at least a dozen times in the last 2 months!! I used my own bbq sauce but that was the only alteration. We both agree this is the best recipe hands down!!! Thank you for sharing it with us.

For the people who say the recipe is too salty...DO NOT USE TABLE SALT.  Always use Kosher salt or Sea Salt.  Thank you so much for a wonderful rub recipe.  Like most people I didn't have the patience to make the sauce.  I didnt have paprika so I substituted it with chili powder and added about 3 times more cayenne than called for.  Marinated for 24 hours and then baked them on 275 in a convection oven covered with foil for 3 hours.  At 2.5 hours I poured 1 can of beer over the ribs (cuz I was worried they were going to be too spicy). Recovered and baked for another 1/2 hour.  Then to the charcoal grill.  I added a tablespoon of liquid smoke to sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and basted the ribs.  Cooked on 225 for about 30 mins.  basting every 5-7 mins and flipping.  The meat fell of the bone.  The rub is absolutely delicious.  As written not spicy at all.

Awesome Rub! Great flavor. There are a few things to be careful of.1st, you will have PLENTY of rub so don't double it if you are doubling the recipe. 2nd, The cooking time is too long. The first time I made this recipe I WAY overcooked at 3 1/2 hours, the second time they were ready for sauce @ 2hours and 45 min with 14 lbs in the oven. And 3rd, with or without sauce they are great. I skipped this sauce and used "Bone Sucking Sauce" from the store.

These were SO good!  I did not marinate the ribs in the spice rub as suggested, just rubbed them and threw them in the oven; they still turned out great.  The only change I made to the sauce was to cut all ingredients in half and used more of the pan drippings than called for (probably 1/4 cup); I also cut the ingredients in half for the spice rub (I used 1 large rack).  The ribs were absolutely fantastic, but we thought the sauce was just ok...it was really ketchup-y even though I added about 1 tsp of hickory liquid smoke flavouring.  So I will definitely make the ribs with the spice rub again, but probably won't use this recipe for the sauce.

The absolute finest Pork Rib recipe.  I didn't even take them to the grill for the extra
cooking.  I went conservative on the cayenne because my child was eating them.  I will never use
another recipe for any of my ribs.  The BEST!

These are so tender and delicious!  I cut the black pepper and cayenne pepper back by half because I want the kids to be able to eat it too (it's pretty spicy otherwise). I just use bottled BBQ sauce, so this is as easy as it gets for such rave reviews.  My dad even loved these, which is a huge compliment.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.  Lately I've been rubbing these down with liquid smoke before I use the dry rub and leave overnight.  This really makes them even better since I don't use the wood chips when I grill them.

The Best Ribs in Town: That's what DH said after dinner tonight. Coming from him that is a HUGE compliment, he is a bit of a connesuir of them. I would say 9 out of 10 times we eat out, he orders ribs. Some of his comments: I'm never going to be able to order them again. These are absolutely perfect. You should open a restaurant! LOL

This recipe is awesome! I covered the ribs in foil for the first couple hours of baking to seal in the moisture and just used some bottled barbecue sauce to finish them off. I am by no means a great chef and these taste wonderful!!!

I made this recipe several different ways (starting with the original), and they're all delicious!  As written, it's too hot for my taste, so I cut down on the black pepper, and leave out the cayenne, plus I use a different barbecue sauce, as this one was WAY too thin - I prefer Sweet Baby Ray's but your favorite (good quality) BBQ sauce will do.  I've also discovered that slow cooking this is perfectly suited to the ribs, I let them sit refrigerated in the crock pot with the rub overnight, start it on "low" in the morning, then, an hour before serving, drain out the accumulated juices, and add the BBQ sauce and let simmer.  Best ribs EVAH!   Serve with big green salad and hot sourdough rolls.

These ribs were great! We couldn't get enough of them! I used a dry rub and marinated overnight. Then I wrapped in foil without adding the bbq sauce, and cooked for 4 hours at 225. They were so tender! After cooking them for 4 hours, I put the sauce on, then broiled. They were very delicious!

USE TOMATO PASTE FOR THE KETCHUP.  Use an extra onion or two, and sautee the onion until it almost dissolves.  Then you add the tomato paste.  If you do that, and make sure to cook the sauce reeeeeeally slowly, this makes the best b-b-q sauce you have ever put between your lips.  If you get impatient, the sauce will scorch and taste nasty.

Way too salty. I like a lot of salt, but these were way over board, ruined the entire meal for me.Plus I didn't care much for the rub in general. I scrubbed them off to use as left overs the next day and they were better, but still to much salt.

I followed the rub exactly as written, but I did not make the BBQ sauce. I found myself wishing that I had doubled or tripled the amount of cayenne. The flavor and tenderness of the ribs was fantastic though.

BBQ sauce is a bust! I really don't think the BBQ sauce is anything special (tastes more like ketchup than anything else). I do, however, LOVE the dry rub. 
In my first attempt I was only baking 1 rack of ribs and the 3-4 hours uncovered *really* overcooked/dried out the ribs. So if you're planning cooking half of the ribs, just plan to bake in the oven for about 1-1 1/2 hours *covered*. After that you can throw it on the grill for 20-30 mins (or until done to your liking) and you'll be set.

Excellent rub, use to just use BBQ sauce on my ribs, never again. I followed rub directions exactly and didnt find it too hot at all. Everyone here except  myself do not like food very spicy and they all liked these ribs. I have made them twice and havent yet let them sit the full 8 hours in the fridge, bet they will be a 6 if I do, thanks for the recipe.

Unless you are an absolute fan of smoking things, I would maybe skip the grilling part.  I followed the recipe word by word and my ribs came out charred.  It seems that a lot of the people that reviewed this reciped skipped the grilling part...I would 2nd that motion.  The sugar on the ribs burns to easily I think and I had my heat on low on the grill.  To be honest, I smoke all the time and I could barely even sense the smoke flavor.  I would suggest either to just leave them in the oven a little longer or if you have to put them on the grill, reduce the time and turn the ribs OFTEN.

The other reviewers must really like their black pepper :)  

I ommitted the cayenne because we have small children.  Our family found this way to peppery for our liking, but the ribs (I used country style) came out incredibly tender and the children loved the sweetness.  I may make this again but tone down the pepper next time.

This is my favorite ribs recipe. It takes a long time to make this recipe, but it's worth it.  Every time I make it, everyone loves it.  On occasion just to save some time, I've used store bought BBQ sauce instead of making it from scratch and they still turn out good.

It had potential but it turned out soooo salty it was not edible.  I think the 1/4 CUP salt must be a misprint.  I would try 4 teaspoons of salt instead of 4 tablespoons!!  
Also, the 6 lbs of spareribs should have been written as 12 lbs of spareribs!!

I'm curious as to how so many people did not have the same, extreme saltiness problem I had.  Thank goodness I did not have guests over at the time I served this!  I would love to try it again with the appropriate revisions.  It smells delicious!

I love these! I have made them several times and are always a hit. I cover them when I back them in the oven. The first time I didn't and they dried out. You can also instead of grilling them pour off the excess liquid out of the pan and just pour the BBQ sauce directly over them and bake them at 350 degrees for another 45 min to an hr. they will brown lightly and they just fall off the bone. This is a good way to do them when you don't have time to stand over the grill. EXCELLENT!!! Also I like a thick bbq sauce.. I don't put the water in the sauce.. I drain the liquid off the ribs in the oven and add just enough to thin it down a little.

I am only rating the rub part of this recipe. We just bought a smoker and I had no idea how to make a rub so this fit my needs perfectly! I scaled this recipe to 8 servings since we had four pounds of pork ribs. This still made enough to cover both the ribs and a four pound brisket also even though we spread it around very generously! I followed the directions exactly except for adding onion powder and using 3/4 cup white sugar with 1/4 cup brown sugar. This created such a nice crust on the ribs while they cooked in the smoker! Everyone raved about them at our Labor Day party although the cayenne pepper does make this pretty spicy! We love spicy, but if serving to kids I might tone it down a bit next time! I think this is a wonderful rub and I will use it on more than just pork ribs in the future! FYI: I agree with SDALLENHOU and doubt I will ever make the sauce part of this recipe. It doesn't sound very tasty and actually although we served these ribs with homemade BBQ sauce, we loved eating them with just the dry rub!

Must be a Texas thing!! Followed the directions carefully, but these were just way too peppery, spicy, you name it. Too over the top, but I think that's how they do things in Texas. I thought with so many 5 star ratings it would appeal to my family for sure. I ended up scraping off as much of the sauce and rub as I could, coating the ribs in honey barbecue sauce and letting them sit under the broiler for about 5 minutes to carmelize. Much tastier after I did that!

These were so good they didn't even need the sauce. I served it on the side, but everyone prefered them plain. I did cut the salt in half. Hubby remarked that next time I can increase the cayenne pepper as it needed a little more heat and kick. We didn't use the oven just left them on the grill in the foil and let them cook slowly (the time was the same as the oven called for) until they fell apart. Delicious!!!

This was excellent!!!  The only change I made was I dumped everything in the crockpot because I didn't think ahead to marinate the ribs.  They were tender and tasty, fast and easy.  I'm sure they'd be even better on the grill, but crockpot gives you more options and is easy for a mid-week family dinner.

Best Ribs I've ever made!!!  This was delicious, only thing is I didn't have time to make the gravy.  Meat fell off the bone and was deliciously dry to the touch on the outside but juicy, juicy, juicy on the inside.

Incredible recipe!! My husband and I joined a handful of neighbors for a "rib cook-off;" we had never cooked ribs before and found this recipe and decided to give it a try in the cook-off. We won the cook-off!! I would recommend this recipe to anyone!! It was incredible!

Wow!!  This is sensational.  We now have Friday night rib night every fortnight with this recipe. We dont sell smoked wood chips in Australia so I added about 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the basting sauce.

very good--take the time to let it marinate with the rub -- worth the effort!  It's the only one I make now.

Very good, I used country pork ribs and they came out tender,(not like baby back) but a lot more meat. Did not hassle with the sauce, I used Cattleman's and was perfect. There are too many BBQ sauces out there to use. After preparing the first part you are kinda are tired to chop stuff up again for sauce.

You can not go wrong with this recipe.  I followed it to a T (which is highly unusual for me) and they turned out delicious.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the post.

Stop looking for any other pork rib (babyback)  recipe! I've already made this dish twice, and have received rave reviews on both occassions.  Few suggestions: Stay away from the liquid smoke.  Add small amount of Cumin to the recipe.  Enjoy!!

This rub was amazing!  I only had 2 lbs. of ribs so I halved the rub recipe and kept the rubbed ribs covered in the fridge all day.  I too used a bottled sauce and had to bake them (uncovered, 1 hr and 15 min. at 350F) because I don't have a barbecue but man oh man, were these ever tasty!  Yee-ha Laura!

I too am from Texas and always enjoy good pork ribs. These are very good. May I suggest also rubbing the ribs with liquid smoke along with the other "rub ingedients, this makes for a nice smoky flavor.

Oh...My...Gosh!   These were fantastic.  I went through step one (rub and bake) and went off my step-son's middle school track meet while they baked in the oven for six hours.  We are a family of varying tastes (husband AND three kids 11 to 17) and yet EVERYONE loved them!!!  No need to add the sauce.   Next week we're going to try the rub on a beef roast, as suggested by the 17 year old!!!  THANKS for a fantastic recipe.

The rub is excellent if you cut the sugar and I didn't use pepper or cayenne, No way I want heat to overpower the flavor. I just put a bit of Tony's, was perfect, also I always use Kosher salt, never use table salt anymore. I put about 3/4 tbls. Wasn't a fan of the sauce, so second time I used my regular Sweet Baby Ray's and added a splash of liquid smoke.  I used country style ribs, refrigerated over night, baked-wrapped in the foil for 2 1/2 hrs in toaster oven, didn't use the convection, although you could if pressed for time. Put on grill for 30 minutes basting with sauce, turning so often.  Everyone loved them, so tender and juicy, the VERY BEST ribs I have ever eaten.  I won't be ordering them out anymore?   Thanks for the post.

I have made these several times and they are so delicious each and every time. The only thing I do differently, is add a bit of honey to the bbq sauce (if you do this make sure to add a extra sprinkle of cayenne pepper so it's not too sweet) right before the simmer stage. I also sprinkle a little extra brown sugar on the ribs right before putting the ribs on the grill. The added honey and brown sugar candies on the ribs, giving you a nice delicious candied char to the ribs. The meat is so tender that when you take your first bite, you almost take the whole rib off the bone. If you have not tried this recipe, your missing out on some of the best ribs you will ever put in your mouth. I will never order ribs at a restaurant,  because they can not measure up to these!

I have never made ribs before because I was afraid they would be too dry but these were not, They were amazing! I made the rub exactly as written and I am glad I read a lot of the reviews first. I kept the rub in a bowl and just spooned it on the ribs until I didn't need any more and stored the rest! I did make the bbq sauce and the only changes I made to it was I added some honey and liquid smoke and I thought the sauce was incredible! I will definitely be making this again, and again, and again! Thank you for the wonderful recipe! Also as many other people stated, the rub is delicious and I plan on making a large batch of it to keep on hand!

I found this recipe on allrecipes.com in 2004 and have used it since then. These are great, fall off the bone, good. I don't use the BBQ sauce because I don't think they need it.  Good, good, good.

I made the rub exactly as indicated except I used coarse kosher salt instead of regular salt.  I had 7 pounds of pork ribs.  I had more than half of the rub left over, so next time I will cut rub recipe in half.  I baked them covered in foil in oven at indicated temp for 4 hours for desired tenderness.   I used store-bought honey barbeque sauce since I didn't have that much ketchup on hand. I didn't grill outside, just put sauce on and put them back in oven uncovered for 45 minutes at 325.  Holy cow are these great!  Everybody loved them!  My daughter who doesn't like barbeque sauce ate some of the ribs I didn't put sauce on and loved them too!  Came out perfectly tender and wonderful flavor, great recipe!

Delish! Cut back sugar in the rub to 1 c. and changed the sauce ingredients/amounts as it sounded too "ketchupy."  Used 1-1/2 c. ketchup, 1 c. Presidents Choice BBQ sauce and 2 c. water, and did not add the sugar at all.  Plenty of sauce (lots left over) and it was the best!  Did not go the grill route, but poured sauce over ribs in the roaster and baked in oven for about 30 mins.  Would definitely make this again with these modifications but next time would do the sauce/bake for a full hour or up to 1-1/2 hrs.

Nice and spicey but way too much salt, even though I halved the amount of salt for the rub.  Other than the spiceyness,  I thought that the ribs were kind of tasteless.  Refrigerated the rubbed ribs for 16 hours.  Cooked for 3.5 hours with the last 1/2 hour using our own BBQ sauce.  Very disappointed considering the large number of favorable reviews.  Would not make again.

This was awesome and I used the sauce too. I scaled back the sauce mix by only using 1 cup water and 1 cup 1 cup ketchup, mainly because I didn't have enough ketchup and I had a lot left over in the end anyhow. My rub was on heavy and so it had a nice bark to it. The meat really was falling off the bone when I tried to cut it. Everyone loved it. I cooked mine in the oven for exactly 4 hours at 275, they looked very dry but were not at all. On the grill for about 20 min total. I suggest putting on the sauce on the grill and then bringing the rest of it to the table for adding on top of the ribs. We tried that and it was great. I like a wet rib. Perfectly sweet with not much heat at all. First time I have bbq'd pork ribs.

Didn't need any sauce. This was my first time making ribs and I'm not going to look for another recipe.  I used smoky paprika, but was a little short of the amount needed. I didn't grill them at all.

I used babyback ribs. I didn't marinate them. I just put the rub on the ribs, added a little beer to the bottom of the crock pot and cooked them on low for 4 hrs and then on high for another 4 hrs. Took them out and cooled them for two hours. Didn't use the BBQ sauce from recipe or from bottle. We like them dry.  Finished them off by warming them back up on the grill for 10-15 min.   I made this for Father's Day. I made extra and my family and guests ate every little bit and wanted more...

My wife and I loved this recipe.  I cooked it in the oven, no BBQ time.  I cooked it for 3 hours and 15 minutes with just the dry rub, then applied the sauce and cooked it for 30 more minutes.  I kept the temperature at 275F for the whole time.  The meat just fell off the bone...best ribs we`ve ever had.

Unbelievable recipe!  I actually use this recipe for pork chops.  They are juicy and amazing.  The pork chops don't have as much fat so I usually use a bit of butter on top. I wish I could make this recipe every day!!

This dish turned out great, and my family loved the flavor.  I used country-style pork ribs.  I have not used dry rubs much before, but will certainly do more after this experience.  I marinated overnight and steamed the ribs (3 lbs) for 30 minutes before grilling with wood chips.

OH MY!!! These ribs are SERIOUSLY delicious...  Everyone I've served them to couldn't get enough.  

The second time I got lazy and used a bottled BBQ sauce and my boyfriend said they were still delicious but he liked the recipe's sauce better. In my opinion, though, the BBQ sauce isn't worth the trouble if you have a bottle of good stuff on hand.  Either way you do it, the rub is what makes these.  

Don't hesitate to give this one a try.

Didn't change a thing. Came out wonderful and will for sure be making these again. Very tender. Can't rate the sauce because we never use any. Good BBQ never needs sauce.

Absolutely delicious!!  Best ribs I've ever had anywhere.  The rub is fantastic.  Slow roasting method gets rid of all the fat.  Perfect.

These are Tennessee pork ribs and they're slap your mama good! I used 7 pounds of baby back ribs. They stayed in the oven for 4 hours and then went to the grill, but we didn't use the wood chips. They were so tender they fell right off the bone. The whole recipe is good, but I would consider using a bottle of store bought bbq sauce next time.

Yep, these ribs are the best!!!!  I didn't use wood chips in the grill and forgot to add cayenne to the sauce, but oh man, we couldn't get enough of these.  I cooked them in the oven for about five hours since we are at 10,000 feet, and I loved the way the crust was a little like jerky and the inside was soooo tender and flavorful.  Better than the restaurant!  Don't bother with any other recipes!  
Oh, and like another reviewer, you need to cut the sugar in half if only cooking one or two racks.  1.5 cups was way too much for my 5 lbs spareribs

I can't help but chime in on the super positive review of the rub.  I used it on another recipe ("Baked Bar-be-que Chicken") and it really made a difference.  It's definitely a keeper!

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this recipe (as written) very much. It was too sweet and too "much". The flavors were too overpowering. I think the combination of spices is right but if I make this again I will cut down on everything so I can still taste the meat.

These were very good.  They were a little salty for us, but the taste was good. I added some liquid smoke and honey to the sauce and it turned out great.  Will try again with a few adjustments.

We have made this w/ beef and pork with bones and without and it always turns out great! The original recipe calls for 12 servings so remember to scale down! We scaled back on the drippings after the first batch of BBQ sauce for our liking.Other than that followed to the letter!

"Texas pork ribs" is just a weird concept.  Texas ribs are BEEF! meaty & CHEWY: something to sink your teeth into, not fall apart tender. Pre-roasting is very "a la the 'burbs", not at all innovative. The recipe gives good results for what it is and I might've given it 1 more star if not for the oxymoronic name.

These ribs were awesome!  I just used the rub recipe.  We were going to serve bottled bbq sauce on the side, but, one taste of these tender, juicy ribs we decided no sauce was needed!  These will definately appear on the menu often.  Thanks for the recipe, Laura!

WOW! Fabulous.  Just before applying the dry rub we brushed the ribs with a solution of 1 part Liquid Smoke and 3 parts water, then marinated overnight.  Next time I'll cut the cayenne in half.  We baked the ribs at 250 degrees.  We put sauce on half of them.  No smoking/grilling.  YUM!  It freed up the BBQ for a mess of chicken we were also serving.

I still gave this recipe 5 stars, but I felt it had just a bit too much salt in the rub.  But man oh man you couldn't get better ribs anywhere.  And know this is coming from a girl who's dad used to OWN a rib joint!!  I plan on using my own bbq sauce next time as my kids are used to it but I WILL put some of the pan drippings in it before I slather it on!! This one's a keeper!  I'm giving this recipe to my dad:).

We wanted to make this recipe but didn't have as much time to spare as it called for.  We used the rub and let it marinade in the fridge for about 4-1/2 hours.  Then we let them cook for about 3 to 3-1/2 hours instead of 4.  I will tell you that they were excellent.  There were none left!  I loved the rub, didn't need the BBQ sauce.  I will no doubt make these again.

I have not made the sauce part of the recepie, but the rub portion is awsome.  It gives you the ability to really kick it up a notch or just leave it mild.  I prefer to use Masterpiece sauce for my ribs......a great croud pleaser

The first time I made them, I followed the recipe.  The ribs got a little dry in my opinion when baked for so long.  The second time I made some changes and the ribs were wonderful!  I coated the ribs with the rub, then vacuum-sealed to allow the flavors to really penetrate.  I'm sure a regular freezer bag would work well also.  Then, we grilled them instead of baking in the oven, and skipped the sauce.  These were the best!!!

Excellent ribs...thought we were eating in a rib joint...only used 1 1/2 tsp. of salt and omitted the cayenne pepper because of the kids...well worth the work...can't wait to try them again...the few leftovers were excellent reheated..

My husband loves ribs, I don't really care for them too much.  This was one recipe that we both thoroughly enjoyed! 
Thanks for passing it on!

Great! As a Creole from the Big Easy, I was weaned on Tabasco!  Cayene
isw no problem to our taste buds.
Would be great in the Kamado or "The Big Green Egg".

Awesome recipe. I applied the rub a mere 3 hours before baking and the flavor still permeated throughout the meat. I only did 2 pounds of ribs which were wrapped in a foil pouch for 2 hours and 15 minutes at 275 degrees, then uncovered on broil for 20 minutes (applying Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce during the last 5-7 minutes). The broil at the end developed a really nice "bark" and nicely caramelized all those sugars. On that note, I think I will decrease the amount of sugar a bit and increase the cayenne a lot next time (a little too sweet and I didn't detect any heat). Also, I applied the salt and pepper separate from the rub to control the amount for my personal preference; incidentally I believe it ended up being the measurement called for in the recipe. Gonna eat my leftover rib on a bun with extra sauce for lunch today- so delicious!

Tried this recipe for the first time with fresh wild boar ribs from a hog hunt my husband went on. They were amazing! Have cooked one more time and I now am a rib master :-) I highly recommend this recipe.

Tried this this weekend. I am a big ribs fan but they are quite expensive in New Zealand so I spent a lot of time looking through the recipes and ended up on this one. I used the rub "as is" and marinated overnight. Cooked them as the recipe states right up until the grilling phase (its too cold here to get the grill going). I made a couple of changes to the sauce (using home made ketchup) and added a little whiskey, liquid smoke and a drop of maple syrup right at the end(Kiwis are a little funny about hot spices). I'm from the UK but I was having guests... I then coated the ribs in some sauce and broiled (grilled to me) them  until they browned a little. They were awesome! Lovely sauce, so tender that they fell off the bone (literally with the first rack, good job I had an extra). I would recommend this recipe and method as a great introduction for winning ribs. After you've tried them you can add your own touches and tweeks if you feel the need. Or not. Well worth the effort and thank you for posting!

Great! And so easy. My nephew had a pig butchered he had raised for a school project, so we had a lot of pork to cook. I had never cooked ribs before and was looking for a recipe that you didn't need a smoker. Seen a few that said boil them before putting on the grill, NO BOILING. Then found this recipe that sounded like what I was looking for. Followed recipe for the rub and it is great. Covered the ribs with the rub and left over night in the fridge. Cooked in oven for about 3 1/2 hours then put on the grill medium direct heat for about 40 min. Started with bones on the bottom after 10 min. flipped over to bones on top for about 10 min. Then added more soaked wood chips for lots of smoke and flipped to bones down again and put BBQ sauce (I just used KC Masterpiece original) on them and let smoke 20 minutes. Didn't have any problems with burning. They have turned out GREAT every time!

Followed directions to the letter.  Left in fridge for 24 hours.  Way too much sugar, the drippings were carmalized and couldn't use in basting/sauce recipe.  Put the rib rack in between the two burners to brown up with grill at 300 for 10 mins.  Flipped the rack and nothing but burnt rub.  Had to cut off the burnt sugar and wasted half the rack of ribs.

Yeehaaaaaw! My husband forgot to season and prep the ribs for dinner one night and when I found them in the fridge the next morning, I had a sense of dread in my belly... I HAD TO SEASON AND PREP! Being that I'm a newbie at cooking, something like ribs is intimidating to me, and so I wanted to find an easy and hopefully tasty recipe for ribs. Eureka! This one was it! Easy-peasy ingredients that I already had at the house, and all I had to do was mix the dry ingredients and slap them on the ribs? Oh yea. That easy. I'll tell you that after I rubbed the spices on, I only left it in the fridge for about 2.5 hours and I baked in the over for another 2.5 (I poured a little Blue Moon beer in the pan so they wouldn't dry --not that they would have dried, just any excuse to use beer, i guess), and then the hubby grilled them for about 5 minutes using store-bought sauce. Perfecto! The fam loved the flavor, hubs was impressed that I was able to prep said delicious ribs, and me? I'm feeling pretty good about rubs and ribs now! (p.s. I did alter the amt of sugar -used a little less- and it was still GOOD and sweet)

I’ve made these about 20 times. Great recipe. I use the rub on other meats too. I usually make a smaller amount of sauce because I’m not that keen on it, and I always put it on the side. The recipe speaks for itself and doesn’t even need sauce imho. I put these on my smoker for 30 minutes after cooking. I’ve even baked them, wrapped them in foil (really well) and kept them in the fridge a day or so before smoking. It helps if you’re planning a party. If I do that, I will extend the smoking time to get them warmed up.

I did make a couple of changes of my own on the rub not major;) after marinating the ribs in the rub for 24 hours in the refrigerator I put them in my Brinkman smoker and kept apple wood and hickory smoke on them, for an hour or two.  I cooked them low and slow at around 225 degrees about 6+ hours I also put my own barbeque sauce on them for the last hour and half.  The family said they loved them.  Yeah!

This was an excellent recipe, halfed the recipe for 2 full racks of baby back ribs.  Followed all the instruction past the 3-4 hour bake time.  Placed on BBQ for 10 minutes, and basted with Roasted Raspberry Chilpotle Sauce from Costco.  Absolutely wonderful!

I am always trying different rib recipes and this one is by far one of my favorites!  I made 3 slabs of ribs and fed 5 hungry guys and all of them raved that they were falling off the bone.  Just the right amount of kick and delicious.  The nice thing about the rub is your measurements don't need to be exact and it will still turn out.  I had about 7 lbs and I baked them for 2:45 before grilling.  I was feeling lazy and didn't make the bbq sauce, although I did use the drippings and sauteed the onions and then just added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and heated it all together and basted the ribs with it.  Yum!

I think it was good but a little spicy. I would like it if it was a sauce instead of a dry rub. I made it from 11:00 to 6:30. I should have started it the night before. I think you should too.

I love this rub.  After letting the ribs soak up the flavor overnight, I throw them in the slow cooker with just a little bbq sauce for a few hours. I usually cook about 3-4 lbs. and make 1/2 the rub recipe.  When they are tender I put them on a foil-lined pan, paint them with some more sauce (or the sauce in the slow cooker) and put them in a hot oven until the they are jewel-like from the glaze caramelizing.     I hate to cook outdoors and this method makes for some great ribs.  (I like to eat grilled food, I just hate to be the outdoor chef!)

Tender, spicy, moist and lip smacking good!  I reduced salt as recommended and served the bbq sauce on the side.  I baked mine covered for 2 1/2 hrs then uncovered the final hour and basted them to prevent too much drying.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! Now these take forever and a day to make, but it is SO worth it! These are excellent. I never made something that would be such a hit with everyone that ate them. I never put them on the grill (laziness) but I always put them under the broiler and basted them. During the summer I will make these again and use the grill. They must taste even better.

The rub was amazing!  Did not make sauce.  Plenty of leftover rub to use on other dinner nights!

We really loved this recipe.  There were a lot of steps to follow, but it was well worth it in the end.  The meat just fell right off the bone.

I tried out the rub and the cooking method with this recipe. I had made ribs only once before this recipe and they were a disaster. Not any more! The rub is to die for, and the cooking method was very simple and good. I used chipolte and jerk pork seasoning the first time I made the rub instead of cayenne and paprika as it was all I had on hand. The second time it was made as stated in the recipe. Both were very good. Rub seems to be versatile, don't be afraid to experiment! Try to finish ribs on grill though. It makes ribs to have the sauce bake on and the edges get a little crispy.

Altered dry rub recipe with 1/2 cup brown sugar and only 1 cup of white sugar.   Used bottled BBQ sauce.  It turned out phenominal!!  No need to go thru the process of making homemade BBQ sauce.  My overly-picky 4 yr old and myself a grumpy 40yr old enjoyed this meal.

5 stars for the rub! I either use a bottle of store-bought sauce or none at all (the rub is that good!). The only change I make is using brown sugar.

Too salty - way too salty.  Almost to the point of being inedible. I will give this another try but will drastically cut the salt.

Rated five star by outcome, not by process.  I don't care what Texas should or shouldn't be.  These turned out awesome.  I couldn't help but add a little bourbon to the sauce.  I had no trouble with the grill caramelizing the sugar too much either - I just kept the heat down on that side and fired up the smoking side.

This is one of the best recipes. I don't use the "sauce" part but just do the rub the night before and bake.  When it comes time to bbq them we just use whatever bottle we have on hand.  But these are so good and melt in your mouth.

REALLY GOOD!  We doubled the recipe for 13 pounds of pork spareribs, added 4 Tb of smoked paprika, and had the perfect amount of rub.  We didn't do the sauce; just used Bulls Eye Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce and added some mesquite wood chips to our mesquite charcoal.  A HIT at our annual gathering on the 4th.  Only 4 stars, though, cause it was a little too salty and spicy for my taste, so next time I'll adjust.  Thanks!

I agree with souppe when it comes to precooking. 2 things - Lower the sugar in the rub. I cut mine in half and it was fine. I used bottled sauce. Next time I am going to experiment with wrapping in foil for the first half of cooking time then open. Mine turned out drier than I like also leaving them uncovered. I cooked one rack for 3hrs @ 275.. I didn't know. Even two racks would turn out dry inmho for 3-4 hrs as suggested. So cut down the cooking time and save energy!

Super easy!!! I am so amazed at how incredibly easy this was and it was a huge hit.  I didn't do the BBQ sauce because it was sticky and saucy enough.  I ended up with extra rub, which I put into a ziploc bag for a later date.  My husband and son loved this recipe and I will absolutely use this again.  Followed the recipe to the letter except I did double the cayenne pepper, but don't do this unless you can handle the spice.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

From one Texan to another....oh my gosh these were soooo good! I followed the spice rub exactly, let them sit and baked them as directed. I was running short on time so we just put the ribs on the grill and "sauced" them with store-bought sauce for the last few minutes. They were so tender and delicious. A definite keeper!

I scaled down the recipe for 1.5 lbs of ribs (one rack of ribs) and it was very good!  Wouldn't change a thing about it.  The cayenne pepper added just the right amount of heat (and I like spicy foods).  The quantity of dry rub was about 15% too much for one rack of ribs, but it's better to have too much rub than not enough!  Refrigerated the ribs for 6 hours and the ribs still turned out really good.  Will be using this recipe again!

I rubbed the ribs with all but the sugar and kept in frig. for 5 hours. Then baked uncovered at 275 for 2 1/2 hours. Finished on grill over indirect heat and soaked wood chips for 45 minutes. Also, basted with favorite BBQ sauce. These were better than any I've ever had!!

Wow ! Superbowl Sunday & took a chance ! Only change was Brown Sugar instead of white & slightly more cayenne. 
  These ribs are so good - but to cheat use Head country as a slather sauce..... from the gang here( no drunks )we have a 50/50 split on preferred sauce.

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST RUBS I'VE EVER USED. REFRIGERATE OVERNIGHT AND BAKE AS STATED. I DO NOT CARE FOR THE SAUCE, I JUST BUY BOTTLED SAUCE(HONEY HICKORY SMOKE).AFTER THE RIBS ARE GRILLED THEY JUST FALL APART IN YOUR MOUTH.

This was our first time making ribs- the meat fell off the bone and was outstanding- the sauce was great, too.  I did use half ketchup and half bottled BBQ sauce to make the sauce since my husband is not crazy about ketchup.

These were the BEST.  Easy to make and wonderful to eat :)  Great even without grilling.  We have used the rub on  boneless chicken and its great too.  This is the rib recipe to use.  The only change I made was to slice the ribs into single rib pieces before rubbing them. Yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

These ribs are excellent on a smoker style charcoal grill. Next time I may cook them on the upper level for a few hours instead of oven. That way they could be done at campsite.Sweet,smoky, and a little spicy makes these ribs delicious.

I used the country pork rib cuts.I marinated overnight. I roasted in the oven only-not on the grill,for 5 hours. "BEST RIBS I HAVE HAD IN AGES" my son-in-law agrees! Do make the sauce,as it is very complimentary to this flavorful dish.

I also did not barbecue this recipe; just cooked in the oven. When I made the sauce and added a couple teaspoons liquid smoke to add the barbecued flavor. I modified the sauce and used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the ketchup, only 1/2 c of water, 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 an onion instead of 1/2 c onion. I used all of the pan drippings. Definite keeper!

extremely good! These take a long time but they are worth it. My family loves them and I have used this recipe with beef & pork ribs, chicken, pork chops and beef roasts as well. I don't usually put them on the grill though. Just the same they are Yummy!

First time I ever made ribs.  Will be making it again and again.  Like a number of others did, I used bottled BBQ sauce, but it was still great -- the flavor is in the rub.  I also did not put them on the grill at the end due to the weather -- just brushed on the sauce at the end and baked them an additional 15 minutes.  I made it with

My whole family enjoyed these ribs so much, they just fell off the bones they were so tender!  The dry rub was excellent, I even made a couple of chicken breasts at the same time and used the dry rub on them.  We all thought that the barbeque sauce had too strong of a tomato, or even ketchup flavor, I wii definately make it again, and can't wait to, but I will tweak the sauce a little.

The only change I made is that I doubled the sugar in the sauce (I like em sweet)

Based on reviews, which were all wonderful and very positive, I scaled back the amount of rub because I had 4 lbs. of ribs.  I still had plenty to use another time.  Only thing I didn't use was cayenne pepper because I didn't have any.  Marinated in fridge overnight; 3 hours in 275 degree oven; 20 minutes on medium high grill.  Yummy!  Loved how the sugar/salt coated the ribs.  Sauce was good, but not sure worth the extra time.  I think Sweet Baby Rays or Bone Sucking sauce would have been fine.  Loved it!

I did 3 racks in the oven according to the recipe (only added a sprinkle of liquid smoke to eat rack) once cooked I let rest, cut each rack in half, dumped into gallon zip lock bags, and threw into a cooler on ice. Traveled to the beach and flash grilled to warm them up with a couple store bought bottles of bbq sauce on the side. All demolished. Easiest ribs I’ve ever cooked.

The ribs were delicious!  Followed the recipe just as indicated for the rub and had leftover.  No problem, it will be quicker and easier to make a smaller 1 rack recipe next time.  For the basting sauce, based on others comments, I just used the drippings from the pan and added some Sweet Baby Ray’s.  This made an excellent sauce for the table as well.  Everybody loved it.

Really great recipe. I slightly overcooked the thinner slab but still great taste. however, the recipe makes a stupid large amount of sauce. I halved the sauce recipe and as you can see by the picture, I still had 2x as much as I needed. next time I may just use jarred bbq sauce.

I overlooked the ribs in the oven. I skipped the smoky  grill part and simmered in ketchup, onion and some broth. They rehydrated nicely and were  very good. I think the original recipe rub or marinade could be cut back a little but I made it as recipe suggested for the first time..
Will do again and use the grill next time!

Very good recipe.  You might not even need the BBQ sauce. I love a good dry rub BBQ!  I prepared it as written and left the dry rub sit overnight.  I did use a store bought BBQ sauce as I  didn't read about the 1 hour cook time for the sauce until it was too late!

I did the rub, but used another bbq sauce.  My gas grill burner was too close to the grill and one hour was too long to let it cook unchecked, will try a shorter time the next time.

I love this rub, it's all I use for Ribs. I did make a few changes. I also thought the 1/4 cup of salt is a misprint and would be to much salt. so, i just salted the meat a bit before i put on the rub. I use 1 cup of sugar and that is plenty. I skip the cayenne as I don't care for that kind of heat. I added extra Garlic powder cause we love garlic. I did not make the BBQ sauce as listed. I used Sweet baby Ray's in sweet vadalia onion to make things easier.

I am told I make the best Ribs!!!

Amazing! So very good!!  Instead of cayenne I used cracked red pepper.  Only made half the recipe for just the two of us. Will definitely make it again especially for company. I also shared the recipe with Facebook friends.

I can't belive how much my guys loved this soooo easy recipe! They actually said "you van make this again anytime!"  I did my usual tweaks of substituting for things I actually had on hand but nothing really worth writing about.  Follow the recipe in general and it's all good!

We really loved this recipe! Used the cooking method and the rub but just our bottled sauce from the fridge to cook onto the meat on the grill. 3 hours in the oven (i wrapped in foil) and about a half hour on the grill left the bones clean!

My rating is based on the dry rub alone. It was good, but we didnt think it was fantastic. Though we liked it, I probably wont make it again as I have had better rubs. Thanks.

Fantastic recipe. After reading others' reviews I did cut the cayenne pepper in half, but otherwise followed the recipe by the letter. I made this for my husband for Father's day and he was SO impressed. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

There's a reason this is award winning.  This is a no-fail dry rub that carnivores will want to slather on anything they can get their hands on.  I added a bit of curry, mainly because I like curry, not because it needed it.  I'm going to stash a few cups of this on hand for the rest of the summer.***Update- made this with bone-in ribs and didn't like it as much as with country style ribs.

OH SO GOOD! didn't make the sauce and didn't put on the grill (someone stole it earlier this year).. so just low and slow in the oven made it very tasty and tender! I did add 1 tsp crushed red pepper also for more heat. This rub covered 2 1/2 slabs of ribs (without the bonless edge portion.. used that in the "Best Stovetop BBQ Ribs" recipie [let that one slow cook another hour for FALL APART TENDER ribs]). I served this with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" and fresh lemonade .. went GREAT together!

Meat as candy?  Not for me.  First, I cut the white sugar in the recipe by 2/3.  A day later, I can still taste nothing but sugar. With that level of sugar content, it's almost impossible to avoid burning the sauce on direct heat.  Might be better result with indirect heat.  My take on this - Sugar, with some pork bones.

I did really like the onion fried in pan drippings for the sauce base, great idea.

Fantastic ribs.  I did half without the sauce and half with.  Both were superb.  Best ribs I've ever had!
No changes.  Great recipe.  Thank You!

I had several guys telling me these were the best ribs they have ever eaten, better then restaurant ones. I only make it in the crock pot so they are very soft and juicy. I don't use the sauce, just prepare them with a rub and serve a store bought sauce on a side for anybody who wants sauce. Probably prepared this recipe 10 times within the last 2 years. 

Became a family hit. Now we make it for every family reunion and other gatherings as well. I make one rack as directed and another one less spicy so people have an option. I love this cause it's so easy as well. I onlcy cooked it in the crock pot.

I use this rub from this recipe on baby back ribs and they are always a hit. Slow baking is the key and you don't need to use the grill at all. For party appetizers, I have also cut the ribs apart, rubbed the mix on, chilled and then broiled them. Napkins are still necessary, but the individual ribs are easy to eat while you're holding a drink in your other hand. Gotta keep the men happy at cocktail parties! =) Oh, and this makes a lot of the spice rub. 2/3-3/4 of a batch is plenty enough for the specified amount of meat.

This rub is really good.  My kids don't like the spices, so after experimenting with less and less, I finally just left it out. The black pepper seems to be enough of a kick on its own.  The ribs are hard to keep the ends from drying out, so I have finally learned to cover the ribs up in foil after a while and drip some mop suace into the foil to keep it juicy all the way through the cooking.  Not bbq sauce, because that will burn, but mop sauce or a little rub of cooking oil will work too.  I also use this rub for pork shoulder, which I then slice.  My family loves those too.

The ribs turned out great, but I wasn't a fan of the bbq sauce, I ended up swapping out with some Sunny's that I had.

Excellent flavor and fell off the bones easily, but the meat could have been a little more tender.  May have been because I only did one rack or maybe the quality of meat since I got them on sale.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time i accidently ommitted the sugar, the second time i followed the directions correctly and my family liked it without the sugar!  This is a delicious recipe and we were all smackin' our lips!  Thanks for sharing---this is a treasure and going in my permanent recipe file!

This is the first time I've tried a rub and it was fabulous!!  We all loved it, my 3 kids couldn't get enough.  My husband thought I bought the ribs through take-out from a restaurant!  I made this recipe a second time for friends and family and people couldn't get enough!!  Thank you for an excellent recipe.....and I joined just to review this recipe!

I have made ribs before in the crockpot, but never made a "rub" to cook on the grill.  This coating was amazing!  I did not add as much salt as was noted and I skipped the sauce and used Sweet Baby Ray's, not that it needed any.  Very moist, nice and sweet and salty taste.  Like some of the other reviewers, I will be making this rub and storing it for future use.  Thanks for sharing!

We used this recipe with our July 4th weekend.  The rub is easy to make and very flavorful.  We ran out of Paprika and substituted chili powder instead for 2/3 the amount of the Paprika.  We cut it down a little because the Chili Powder is more powerful and we have 2 family members who cannot handle the hot spices.  The rub made the ribs very flavorful.    However, the sauce which is created is too ketchup based.  In addition, it made more sauce than the amount of the ribs.  The next time, I will use this recipe for the rub only.  In place of baking in the oven, we set it in the same pan we would have used in the oven but on the grill.  We cooked the ribs at 275 to 300 for 2.5 to 3 hours.  Then took the ribs out of the pan and placed directly on the grill.  Because of the sugar based rub, watch carefully as the ribs will burn easily.  Cooked with hickory chips and it was just like eating world class ribs at a rib cookoff.   We will use this recipe (for the rub) again.

Great recipe!  My daughter doesn't normally like ribs (I used boneless spareribs.) She really liked this.  I baked mine then put on the sauce and broiled them in the oven.  The flavor is great.  We all loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.

This rub was amazing. I had 2 racks of pork loin ribs and the amount of rub was excessive. I was glad to have made such a large batch because now I have used it for pork loin chops and plan to use it on chicken as well. I doctored the sauce up a bit - adding some mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce and some red pepper flakes. 3.5 hours in the oven was all the ribs needed - I even skipped the grill step just basting them in the oven a couple of times. This ribs were amazing. I will be making them again! Thanks!

Would have been good if I had not cooked them so long. I was on low for 8-10 hrs but it should have been on warm instead. I also think the BBQ flavor was too strong.

We didn't grill ours and they ended up a little bit dry.  I think cooking or grilling them with the sauce on would have added a lot.  The rub is also really strong and we didn't need quite as much as we put on.  Otherwise they were awesome (and made amazing left overs).

Great ribs!  I just used some bottled sauce to finish it up.  If you're handy with charcoal or have a gas grill with a thermostat, you could just slow roast the ribs in a pan on your grill.  Any way, the rub is great and these were some of the best ribs I've ever had.  I let the ribs cook just a little longer on the grill than stated, as we like our ribs a little on the dry side.  Excellent!

These ribs were the best! Made them for a Labor Day Party and they were a huge hit.  Will make again for sure.

This review is for the rub only - it was great although I would use only 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper - a little went a long way!  I just used generic KC style BBQ sauce for the grill portion and it tasted great.

BRILLIANT!  The meat literally falls off of the bone...they are so tender and juicy.

We ran out of propane at the last minute and had to substitute grill time by placing them back in the oven for the 20 minutes, and they still came out perfect!

The aroma of these was almost unbearable!  But I don't reccomend grilling them after they bake... mine were very black after and it didn't seem as though they needed it.

This was excellent - it was already good coming out of the oven and even better once it smoked on the grill to finish.  My grown son said the flavor was like   jerky.  It could definitely be done, as others said completely in the oven or crock pot, and I agree that it was good with or without the BBQ sauce. (I don't think that part of the recipe was worth the trouble, and will use my own BBQ or bottled sauce next time.)  Also, I found my coals were way too hot at first and charred the ribs.  Be sure to set these on a MED or indirect coal base - definitely with soaked wood chips - to give them that final flavor.  If they DO get burned, you can take leftovers and cut meat from ribs, chop, and serve as chopped bbq the next day.  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

I have used this recipe on baby back and country style ribs, both with great results. The key is in the slow cooking.
My family and friends always request this for get-togethers.

This was editable...however, it was salty and mushy on the top.  I used pork spare ribs, so perhaps it was my fault.  I didn't like the sauce at all so I used Jack Daniel's bbq sauce.

The best! The baby backs came out moist and not dried out. My brothers couldn't get enough of the ribs. The rub is great and the sauce is the extra touch! Will make again and again.

Followed this recipe to a T.  Good ribs.  The meat didn't fall off the bone like we like but it could've been the ribs we got.  We used rub and sauce.  A bit too spicy for the kids but hubby and I liked them just fine.  I'll try this recipe again but next time make adjustements in cooking (maybe covering ribs with foil while cooking in oven to keep them more tender/juicy).

These ribs are superb. I'm not usually that big on ribs and I couldn't stop eating them. Only note, if you're not big on spicy (I am), cut down on the cayenne. I didn't try the sauce, so can't rate that.

I prepared these ribs as the recipe calls for, however I cooked them in my barbeque smoker for about 5 hours at 240-250 degrees.  Came out delicious - better than most barbeque restaurants serve!  Thanks Laura!

I followed this recipe to a tee and it tuned out fabulous.  All my family loved, loved, loved this.  My husband says it put Famous Daves to shame.  I am making it again for a big family barbeque this weekend, can't wait to taste this again.  The rub mixture is so wonderful that if you didn't have time to make the barbeque sauce from scratch, you could easily substitute a bottled variety and it will still be delicious.

I had 6 boneless ribs that I used the rub on.  I had a lot of rub left over and put it in a cannister.  Following someone elses idea I put them in the crockpot.  They were done in 3 hours and 45 min.  When I tasted them they were very peppery so I basted them with barbeque sauce to sweeten them and heated them in the oven.  
I think the rub would be better with less pepper but I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

I've only tried this recipe's rub.  I've added it to pre-BBQ'd ribs (like you'd get from the grocery store) to rev up the flavor.  Now, I've tried it on bs chicken breasts that we grilled on the George Foreman (4 minutes).  Not too salty, sweet or spicy.  It definitely made chicken less boring!

Wonderful rub! It is one that I will keep and use time and time again. I did scale it back to 6 servings. Next time I will use less salt and cayenne. Great recipe kids and husband loved it! Thanks!

This is now a family favorite.  My mother in law asks me to make it all the time.  Bonus points for sure.  I sometimes cheat with a bottled sauce and usually add more cayenne for a bit more of a bite.  The longer the marinade and the longer the slow cook the better.  I sometimes have a hard time keeping the meat on the bones!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Delicious! My only complaint is that the barbeque sauce tasted more like ketchup than I like. I added about a half a cup of 
KC Masterpiece to fix it. I'll be making this recipe many times!

Had a casual dinner party and couldn't wait to try these.  Oohs and Ahs all round.  One guest called later to say how much she had enjoyed the ribs and could she have the recipe.  I followed the recipe, used country style ribs and cheated with the bottled sauce..........wonderful

OH MY GOSH!  These were fantastic!  I made them for father's day dinner and all the guys loved them!  Using country style pork ribs, the hardest part was trimming all the visible fat off.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is Awesome...Yummy!! Takes all day to make but its well worth it!! I've made this several times now...my Hubby just LOVES this recipe. I always have lots of sauce left overs, so I freeze so I can use towards the next time. The rub really makes the flavors, sweet and spicey!! Thanks Laura!!

Fantastic recipe! I do use a store-bought bbq sauce, but I follow the rest of the recipe exactly. I live in Germany and everyone loves a little taste of Texas at a good-ol' American backyard BBQ.

FANTASTIC.  Now I started out with two teaspoons of cayenne and found that was t-too h-h-h-hot.  I also used my own barbecue sauce - But the dry rub method is GREAT.  YES, it does take a bit to prepare, but what a difference!!  I also peel the silver skin off the back of my ribs before I marinate them.  TERRIFIC process.  Try it - without too much cayenne pepper :)  Thanks Texas!

This was really wonderful.  Very easy too, since I used a bottled barbeque sauce (Tony Roma's) and most of the cooking was done slowly in the oven. I'm not sure the barbeque step is even needed. 
   The rub added very tasty but subtle flavor (I ran out of paprika so only used a little, and used only a sprinkle of cayenne pepper).
