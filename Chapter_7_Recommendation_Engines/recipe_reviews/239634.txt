awesome recipie! i did change it a bit.  i added a whole packet of taco seasoning, 4  oz of orzo and a 15 oz jar of mild salsa. i also added 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the meat/pasta mixture before topping with the cornbread mix.  baked it for 1 hour at 400 and then added 1 cup of mexican cheese blend to the top.   kids and husband approved, they even went back for seconds.

I've made this twice now and love it. The second time I made it I put the cheese on top of the turkey which worked better for me.  Easy recipe.

Will make this again but make some changes.  Flavor was good but the texture of the cornbread topping was gummy.  Think instead of adding the can of cream corn will make the batter per the directions on the box.  I increased the orzo to 4 oz as suggested by some reviewers, used 1/2 the package of taco seasoning and used a larger 15 oz jar of salsa.  Thought it was a bit dry after baked so would have a bit more liquid in it (probably increase the chicken broth).  I also added chopped onions and peppers to the ground turkey when cooking and added the cheese on top of the turkey, under the cornbread batter.  Nice flavors and easy.

I am a noted novice in all aspects of cooking.  This recipe turned out a lot better than I expected.  I did add use a full packet of taco seasoning and added another 1/4 cup of chicken broth when I added the orzo.
Will definitely make this again.

This was a quick and easy dish to make.  It was surprisingly filling!  I left out the cheese and oil to save calories.  The cornbread topping seemed to taste very artifical, but I'm sure it was because of the brand of cornbread mix used.  (We rarely eat this sort of thing.)  Also the texture of the topping was more gooey than I expected, not breadlike, even though I baked it longer than the recipe stated.  Maybe next time omit the creamed corn.  Also added a mini can of diced chilis to the turkey.  I'll make it again.  I thought it was a great way to use ground turkey.

I made this to reinvent leftover Thanksgiving turkey and OMG, it was so delicious I ended up eating the entire thing by myself (of course not in one sitting, lol).  I measured 1 lb of leftover turkey and just mixed the taco seasoning all over it.  Threw it in the casserole dish, threw the cheese on top of it and then topped with the cornbread topping.  It turned into an amazing Turkey Tamale type casserole. Will be making this regularly.
