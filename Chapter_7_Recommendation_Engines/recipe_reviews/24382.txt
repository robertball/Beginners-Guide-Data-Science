Very good.  Even my young kids liked it, loved the crunch.  Good enough that my 6 yr. old wanted to lick the plate and she has never done that before!  Wow.  With that said, though I must say that no way do you need to saute the ramen noodles, sesame seeds and nuts in 1/4 cup margarine on the stove top.  That makes it waaay too fattening!  You'll get the same results if you put those ingredients on a cookie sheet and under the broiler for just a couple minutes until toasted.  And from what I have heard from other cooks, you should never saute in margarine anyway, but only butter.

Very good recipe I changed the bak choy to napa cabbage and it was even better.

I think white wine vinegar might have been better?  Either way, not enough vinegar taste for me.  Maybe cut down on the oil and leave the vinegar amount the same.  Had way too much dressing, salad would have been swimming in it, if I'd used the whole amount.

Really yummy!  My fiance loved it, especially the crunchy ramen and almonds.  Next time, I think I'll add some more veggies (cucumber, red bell pepper, carrots) to make it more nutritious.

Took this to a family gathering and everyone wanted the recipe!  I doubled it and it was gone!  I couldn't find Bok Choy at our local grocery store so I used Napa Cabbage instead.  Everything else I did by the book and it was perfect!  Wouldn't change a thing; fantastic dressing!!!!

I really liked this salad. I added even more toasted almonds and in a time crunch you can use a bottled Japanese sesame dressing instead and it still tastes wonderful.

Although I changed things up a bit, I absolutely love this recipe!  Instead of bok choy, I used green leaf lettuce and romaine.  Didn't have sesame seeds, so omited that.  Added more toasted almonds and added grilled chicken from the night before.  Wow!  We're fighting over who gets the last helping!  The dressing in this dish is out of this world!

My husband absolutely loved this salad.  He suggested that we have it frequently.  It was extremely quick to prepare, and finally gave me a use for a bottle of sesame seeds that have been in my cabinet forever.  We highly recommend this recipe.

Wonderful salad Jay! I heated my oil, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce in order for the sugar to dissolve. I then popped it in the fridge to cool. Everyone enjoyed this and thanks!

This is great!  It's always a hit.  I change it 
up just a little by using rice vinegar and adding more soy.

I really, really like this recipes. I had bok choy from from CSA that I had no idea what to do with and this was perfect. Next time I will probably make the following changes: substitute rice vinegar for red wine vinegar, use 1/2 and 1/2 sesame seed oil and olive oil but cut back to a bit less than 1/2 cup, use less sugar and to make a main dish I'm going to add chicken and mandarin oranges! I think I'll use some of the natural mandarin orange juice and some red pepper in the dressing.

This was very easy to make, and a good intrsuction to raw bok choy. Although I cut the amount for the dressing in half, there was still too much. It was also a bit too sweet for out tastes, even though I cut the sugar down. I will definitely use raw bok choy in a salad again, mybe with a tangier dressing next time. Thanks!

This was tasty and easy.  I did not find Bok Choy in either of the stores that carry it during the summer, and so I used a combination of fresh romaine and napa cabbage.  I found this to be a suitable substitute.  Really tasty with nice crunch.  I also used white vinegar which I think would go better than red vinegar.

I'm glad that I didn't rate this right away... b/c I liked it MUCH better the next day! I added the dressing right before serving(like suggested) and found that the raw bok choy was a little too bitter for me, so that I actually liked it better when the dressing had a chance to soften the flavor a bit more. The texture was still nice and crunchy(my favorite part of bok choy) the next day. I also added a few green and red peppers, which also held up well to the dressing. I also thought that the ramen noodles were yummy and indulgent but would have no problem halfing them next time or leaving them out completely and still thoroughly enjoying the salad. So if you try this, see if you might not like it better after letting the flavors mingle awhile longer, just keep the ramen noodles and almonds out until right before serving! Thanks for the tasty recipe! : )

i liked the basis of this recipe but made many changes. first, i used mirin instead of red wine vinegar. i also cut the sugar down to one tbsp., added about 2 tbsp of sesame oil, NO margarine, substituted sesame seeds for the almonds, skipped the ramen noodles, and used baby bok choy instead of a head of bok choy. i will make this again with these revisions. it was nice with salmon and couscous.

Yummy!  I have never had bok choy, and really wanted to try it, so this is the recipe I started with.  It did not dissapoint! My husband and I both loved it! I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I combined some cider vinegar with some rice vinegar to make the 1/2 cup. And I only had part of one green onion, but I wish I had more.  Also, I didn't have much butter, so in trying to conserve it I only used a couple of tablespoons and then also some olive oil.  And then it didn't seem like there was anything to drain, so skipped that step.  But it was still fabulous! Can't wait to make it again!

5 Stars on Flavor, but 3 stars on preparation (in my opinion).  To me, there was at least twice as much dressing as needed.  Lucky for me I was using Bok Choy from the garden, so I went and picked another head.  I used 2 large heads.  My recommendation, in case you don't agree with me is to make this per the recipe, but start by only adding half the dressing and see what you think. For a variation, try seasoned rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar (I think its better this way).  Also really good with part seasoned rice vinegar and part spicy South American pineapple vinegar.

This is a very good recipe - don't let my 3-star rating discourage you.  However, I do not like it as well as another similar recipe on this site called Chinese Napa Cabbage Salad.  The addition of sesame oil, less dressing, and proportionally less sugar make that recipe tastier to us, less soupy, and less sweet.  I have used that recipe with bok choy instead of napa and it is just as good either way.

Very delicious! Even my husband, who claims to be allergic to salads, loved it. ;) Next time, though, I'm going to use less ramen noodles because there seemed to be more of that than bok choy per fork-full.

I like the recipe a lot. I did not cook anything in margarine or butter and I used white vinegar instead of red. It was excellent and simple. No need to cook anything.

The dressing is wonderful. Grilled chicken on top makes it even better.

I made the dressing and everything as written but ended up using less than half the dressing on the salad. I ate half of the recipe in one sitting - yum! I thought it had too many ramen noodles, one pkg would have been plenty, and next time (there will be a next time) I think I will add carrots cut into matchsticks

This is an excellent salad.  I use half bok choy and half napa cabbage and replaced the margarine with butter.  Also I added a couple dashes of fish sauce to the dressing.

Crunchy and tangy. I only had 1/4 cup red wine so I used 1/4 apple cider vinegar, too. Delish! Will make again!

Awesome! As other reviewers have said, it's the dressing that rocked this recipe into my cookbook. The crunchy ramen noodles were also a great cheap ingredient for us poor college students to have around. My friend Peter (who hates vegetables) said this was the best salad he'd ever had! Thanks for the recipe

This was pretty good but I would make some changes.  I only made the drssing using 1/3 cup proportions and it was still too much and soupy. definately less sugar.  I used rice wine vinegar because that is what I had.  i would use more bok choy.  I didn't think it was really necessary to saute the noodles and almonds first after I did it.  Also - this only fed one hungry teenage boy as a snack after school!!!

I made this salad for a neighborhood annual get together and it got exactly the raves I expected.  I used an extra packet of noodles as there appeared to be an abundance of the dressing.  I have been ordered to bring this salad to next year's get together again.

I just made this tonight and my husband and I loved it. The kids..not so much, but they tried it. I followed the recipe just as it is written and I thought it tasted great. I did leave the crunchy stuff  and dressing set aside because there was too much. So I packed it up so we can make this salad again tomorrow.

Delicious! I had bok choy from the garden and was trying to find a way to cook it. This recipe was a hit. Even my husband loved it and he didn't think he would like bok choy.

Great salad! only I replaced the ramen noodles with rice noodles (just a bit more healthy, and tastier) I also added some carrots and halfed the recipe for the dressing.. it was perfect, a big hit! oh and DO keep the ingredients separate if you're saving any for later.

I brought this salad to a potluck and everyone was asking me for the recipe. FYI -- It's delicious when it's fresh, but does not make a good leftover.

This is very similar to 3 other recipes, so I combined all 3. I added carrots for crunch, used regular Bok Choy since I didn’t have baby, and also followed another suggestion and added the noodles to each portion because I anticipated leftovers. I added the flavor packet to the soy mix for flavor and poured over the cabbage early to soften it up a bit. Overall it was very good but needed something to give it some oomph, to make it memorable. Perhaps some red pepper flakes or some lemon or lime zest? Would make again.

I made this by candlelight last night on our gas stove thanks to a surprise power outage in our area. It was easy to make, and both my husband and I loved it! I agree with other reviews: too much dressing. I only used about half, saving the rest for later. I also used only 1 pkg of ramen noodles. I sauteed some tofu in garlic and olive oil and tossed that in to add some protein. Delicious!

Love this salad although I made some changes to it because of my personal taste.   I crush my ramen noodles and along with them I put the almonds and the seasoning packet and brown all together, the oriental seasoning packet really makes the crunchies even better. I use white vinegar and 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and I don't use as much sugar, I start with 1/4 cup and just taste and add until it seems right.   I keep the bok choy, the dressing and the crunchies all separate and just let people make their own salads, that way it doesn't get soggy and limp.  I make enough so I can have this as a side dish for 2 or 3 days.   I am thinking about adding some grilled chicken to make it as a main dish, Has anyone tried it yet?  Let me know how it is.

I wasnt quite sure about this recipe.  I have never had bok choy in anything (besides at a restaurant).  My hubby wasn't real excited with the idea as he had never had bok choy either.  This recipe turned out fantastic!!!  We both really liked this one.  It was a great combination of textures and flavors.  We will definitely be making this one again!

My father's secretary used to make this for company parties and we love it. I lost the recipe but glad I found this one. I did make changes such as half canola oil half sesame oil, white vinegar, used both Bok Choy and Napa Cabbage and I never ever use margarine so I substituded with butter which is much better for you, margarine is disgusting. I also add shredded carrot.

I was skeptical about this recipe due to the inclusion of ramen noodles, but I am now a believer in this crunchy and delicious food.  The only change I made was replacing 1/4 of the oil in the dressing with sesame oil, just to add some more flavour.  I liked how putting the hot toasted noodle/seed/nut mixture on the bok choy while it was still hot wilted the greens a little.  Mmm.

Good and simple, although 2x too much dressing without adding more ingredients.  We made it a meal with grilled chicken and mandarin oranges mixed in and loved it!  Adding some feta would also go well.

I made this because I love cooked bok choy and had never had it raw. It became an instant hit in my family, such that my youngest son constantly requests it! The salad is crunchy, which bitter notes and sweetness and acidity. A real find and very easy to prepare; a nice change from the usual salad.

This was good.  We don't eat bok choy much, but if I buy it again, I may repeat this recipe.  It seemed like nobody liked the bok choy much (too peppery for us), but the crunchy elements and sweet dressing still managed to make it a tasty salad.  I dry roasted the sesame seeds, ramen, and almonds instead of using margarine, and they were still delicious without all the fat.

We absolutely love this salad. I think you DO need to toast the ramen noodles, nuts, and sesame seeds, but do it in butter; about half what the recipe calls for is plenty. Then no draining is necessary. We love the almonds, but budget-friendly sunflower seeds are really tasty too. When I first received this recipe from a friend about 20 years ago, it called for 5 green onions. So that's what I use. We prefer less sweet so I use half the sugar, use more soy sauce, and add the seasoning packet(s) to the dressing. Because it just makes for a true Asian flavor I always grate in some fresh ginger. I say "fresh", but honestly I keep a root in the freezer all the time which makes it super easy to grate as well. I always serve this salad with the three parts separate for several reasons: individuals may want more or less topping or prefer more or less dressing, and that way everything stays crisp and fresh. We've had it with broccoli slaw and/or other cabbages when bok choy isn't available. They're all delicious!

My sister made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit.  She crushed the ramen noodles very small using a bag and hammer. Instead of using Bok Choy she used fresh spinach leaves.  It is best to add the dressing mixture just before serving so keep the crispiness and freshness of the spinach.

Received surplus co op Bok choy from my friend.  I have never used it before.  I wanted to really taste it instead of masking it with garlic and spices.  LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe and my kids did as well!  Thanks so much!

GREAT salad! Very versatile!  I added 1/2 packet of the ramen noodle soup seasoning packet to the sugar before adding wet ingredients.  Tossed in chicken and craisins.  Superb!

Got this recipe from a friend who uses the same CSA as me several years ago. We make it almost every time we get bok choy (which is frequently). I tend to use recipes as polite suggestions, so I do make a fair number of changes, but it's mainly to reduce the calories and fat (less sugar and oil, little or no butter to saute the topping) and increase the vinegar (we like tangy). You do get a fair amount of dressing out of this - I just made it with perhaps one and a half times the indicated dressing to two large heads of bok choy. I also use only one package of Ramen and keep the topping in a little container as we usually get 3-4 (or more) salads out of one recipe of topping. I also think that the Ramen/almonds need more toasting than the sesame seeds, so I usually put the seeds in as soon as I see a smidge of color on the noodles. But, I keep the main flavor profile the same, which is why I rate this a 5.

We've played with the recipe a bit too, and it always turns out well. Different vinegars work well (I've used apple cider, white wine, rice, or a mix of a few - all depends on how well the pantry is stocked at the time). Using part sesame oil is lovely. White/yellow/red onions sliced thin if you don't have any green are fine.

This salad was delicious!  The combination of the crunchy ramen noodle mix with the sweet oil/vinegar/sugar dressing was a perfect combination.  I did make one substitute.  I had to use spring onions instead of green onions, and I threw them into the hot skillet after making the ramen noodle mix to cook them slightly.  I like my onions slightly cooked as opposed to raw.

I used packaged cole slaw mix instead of bok choy, and sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds.  It was great!  Next time I'll toss in some mandarin oranges as well.

This is my favorite salad!!! Been making it for years. I saute bite sized chicken pieces with a little sesame oil to go on top and make a meal. I also prefer toasted sesame seeds. Make sure you brown the topping well enough or it doesn't bring out the flavor!!! There is always left-over ramen topping and we eat it for a snack.

I've lost my original recipe for this salad so rely on this version as a guide.  I use sunflower seeds not sesame seeds.  I make the crunchies in the oven not on the stove top, short the olive oil a tad, and add more soy sauce.  Do not hesitate to use hearts of romaine if you are out of bok choy.  I think romaine works fine and is sometimes more palatable depending upon how adventurous your audience is.  Worth making again.

Amazing, it was a little sweet though.  I will cut back a bit on the sugar next time, and add a touch more soy sauce.

I made this salad tonight.  It was incredible!  My husband said it was the best salad he's had in a long time.  I didn't have any ramen noodles or chow mein noodles on hand, so I used a can of sliced water chestnuts for the crunch - this cuts down the fat some, too.  The dressing was fabulous.  I will definitely be making this again with so much bok choy coming out of my garden.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I rated 3 stars because I knew I'd be swapping out ingredients. The ramen noodles aren't exactly nutritional superstars. I halved the fat and replaced the ramen with some kelp noodles. Next time, I'll try spaghetti squash.

This is an excellent recipe and a great way to expose your family to a new veggie: bok choy! (or reintroduce them if the first try didn't go so well...) I didn't feel that there was enough bok choy so I added 1/2 a head of red cabbage.  I kept the noodles and seeds separate as suggested in another review--that worked out great for the leftovers!  I also used the ramen seasoning (beef flavored) in the dressing as well to give a little more seasoning.  Honey roasted almonds are also a great substitution!

I dry toast my nuts and seeds so decided to cut out the butter/margarine on this one.  It came out perfect.  I also used baby bock choy since that's all I can find here in Japan.  Wow, it is an amazing salad.  My husband was in love and had thirds!  From now on I'm going to serve the ramen, nuts, and seeds on the side.  Just in case there are left overs (which there was) it remains crunchy.  We'll serve this often while Bok Choy is in season here.

I used a packet of already fried noodles so just toasted the almonds & sesame seeds in a pan. The dressing combined with the nuts, sesame & bok choy was lovely. I don't think the noodles are really needed so I would leave them out next time.

This salad was excellent.  Even the pickiest eaters of my family enjoyed it!  We're big fans of green onions, so I added more of those but other than that the recipe is great as is.

Just OK.  I think I made the dressing wrong or needed to let it sit in the fridge for a little while so all the flavors could combine.

I heard on GMA that Boy Choy was packed full of vitamins so I thought I would try some.  I personally think that Boy Choy alone has quite a strong flavor and I was nervous as to what it would taste like in a salad.  I found this recipe and LOVE it.  I first made it last week and I am going back to get more BC today to make it again this week.  

This salad is fabulous!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. After tasting the dressing separately, I wasn't sure if it would work, but I was very pleasantly surprised that it did.

Great way to use up all the bok choy I bought.  I've been eating this all week.  I found that the recipe made more than enough dressing.  I too also added extra almonds for crunch.

This was good! Maybe a little less sugar next time...it's a little on the sweet side. Good!

OK, I didn't know what to expect with this one.  We bought bok choy at a farmer's market without knowing exactly what to do with it. 

This was absolutely wonderful.  What a surprise!  Yummy.  We omitted the sesame seeds (since I didn't have any on hand) and instead substituted twice as much almonds.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for an easy and wonderful recipe.

I just made this for a family gathering and all loved it.  I kept the crunchy items separate as suggested by another reviewer and it really makes a difference. I also substituted sunflower seeds for the sesame seeds.

This tastes really good, but I really enjoy the flavor of bok choy, and this recipe almost seems constructed to hide it.
