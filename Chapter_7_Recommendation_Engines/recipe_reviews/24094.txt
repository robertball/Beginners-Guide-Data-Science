Excellent crust! I've made this crust many times, and I finally mastered the techniques to make it flaky (not recipe's fault but b/c inexperience). Previously, I over-worked the dough, used too much water, and/or didn't keep the dough cold enough, which made the crust tough and soggy. Tips: keep it cold & work it sparingly. Chill water in the freezer until ice crystals begin to form. Cut very cold UNSALTED butter into cubes & cut it in the flour & salt with a pastry blender (or pulse in food processor) until it resembles coarse crumbs. Transfer to large bowl & gently toss water into crumbs 1 tsp at a time with a fork. Do not use food processor to incorporate water - it's too easy to overwork the dough. The dough should have small bits of butter - this makes the crust flaky. Cool off hands under cold water, pat dry, gather the crumbs into a flattened ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate. Refrigeration is necessary b/c it allows the gluten to relax and prevent shrinkage.  You may need to roll out the dough twice. First roll out is usually crumbly, uneven, and has large breaks. Gently gather in edges to form another ball, flip it smooth side up, and roll out again. Smooth, round, even crust should be easier the second roll out. See pics of the process.

SO flaky and tender. TIP: if you don't have a food processor or pastry cutter, try freezing the block of butter, and then grating it. I even put my grated butter back in the freezer, so the little bits FOR SURE stay solid and cold when I'm working the dough.

Ok I love this recipe and as I was reading the reviews I noticed alot of people were having problems with the water and salt and coldness. Well as a professional Pastry chef I can tell you that when dealing with flour you can never put an exact amount of water because the moisture content of your flour is different than mine I live in the desert so it's going to take more water for my flour than someone who lives in Seattle. As for the salt all baking recipes are intended to use unsalted butter if all you have is salted then remove the salt from the recipe. And the coldness Freeze everything for 5 minutes before starting the process. Work quickly and also before I add the water I throw the flour butter mix back in the freezer for a few more minutes. Another tip before you get ready to roll out your dough, fill a few ziploc bags with ice and put on your counter where you will be rolling leave for about 10 minutes. Then roll your way to buttery flakiness. :)

This is THE tastiest crust ever!!! I used to be a dedicated shortening user, but because since moving to Finland from the USA, I have been unable to find it anywhere. I am no longer lamenting my misfortunes, though! This is the best butter crust I've ever tasted, and the only recipe for such that I have ever enjoyed perfect results and consistent success with. Every time I make this it turns out beautifully... I have made just simple pie crusts with it, as well as have used it to do more intricately decorated ones; braided and woven top crusts, have made flowers, fruits and leaves to garnish tarts with, etc., and the pie dough NEVER looses it's shape, even with the most intricate of sculpted details: No melting in the oven. Yippy! I have been using this crust religiously for nigh on a year, and even if I could get Crisco here, I wouldn't even bother using it for pie crusts because this is my crust recipe for all eternity. Oh, I thought I would mention, too, that in a pinch this morning I had to use baking margarine, as I didn't have enough butter for a double-crust, and it still turned out great... ofcourse not as divinely rich and yummy, but still as flaky and tender as always. Thanks for posting the absolute best pie recipe on earth! :P

I used less water than called for -- I think it was 2 tablespoons.  I did not refrigerate at all - just rolled it out and popped it on my pot pie.  When it came out of the oven it was flaky and tender - very yummy!  (and btw, I'm GLAD you published this recipe - who cares if it's similar to another!  I was happy to find it when I searched for "butter pie crust".)  Thanks!!

I was very satisfied with this crust. I usually make the Betty Crocker pie crust with shortening. However, I had forgotten to put the shortening in the refrigerator so I looked for a butter recipe. This one is excellent. I did double the salt since I was using unsalted butter. I think it could have used even more. I did put my flour in the refrigerator. For those new at making pie crusts, it is best to use all cold ingredients. The only other change I made was time in the refrigerator. I only put mine in the refrigerator for 40 minutes. I just didn't have the time to wait for 4 hours. I was also concerned that it would be too difficult to roll out. Before I used the rolling pin, I patted down the ball with my hands and worked the dough with my hands for awhile, until it seemed to be willing to stay together. I then proceeded with rolling it. I like to roll the crust over my rolling pin when done. It makes it easy to unroll it right into your pie pan. I also always brush the crust with a beaten egg white. This seems to help keep the crust from getting soggy. I made a coconut custard pie with this crust and it did not get soggy. Good luck to all who try this recipe. I did find it quite easy to make and very flaky, which is the true test of a good crust.

This crust was delicious!  I blended the butter/salt/flour combo in the processor until crumbly (it doesn't take long).  Then, slowly mix in the water little by little while kneading...I've made this many times and it never took the entire amount of water.  After chilling the dough, it will initially be tough, but don't let that discourage you.  Work it with a rolling pin, and in no time at all you'll have a beautifully shaped crust.  This is a versatile crust, it can be made with sweet and savory dishes alike.

This is the perfect pie crust! I used this pie crust for a dessert pie as well as a chicken pot pie, both came out flaky and full of flavor. Buttery, flaky, wonderful! Always keep all your ingredients cold! Chill your flour in the freezer overnight. Use ICED water, not just really-cold tap water. Work your ingredients together as fast as possible. I usually get all the ingredients together with a quick mix in the cuisinart, and then I finish it off with a pastry cutter right in the cuisinart bowl to break up any big pieces of butter. It will look like a heap of white  reindeer poop. Plop the poop pellets in some plastic wrap, form it into a ball, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Buttery rich and delicious, light and, yes...flaky!  Supposedly only crusts made with lard or shortening will give you a flaky crust, but not so with this recipe. I mixed it up, exactly as written, and used it for "Apple Crumb Pie," also from this site. I did use cold butter, but didn't even bother to chill the dough and it still rolled out like a dream. I scaled the recipe down to four servings, which turned out to be the perfect amount of pastry for two, individual pies. Not only was this surprisingly good, it was probably one of the easiest pie crusts I've ever worked with. A real pleasant surprise all the way around.

I can't believe how great this crust was!  I had no problem rolling it, even though I only had it in the fridge for abour 2 1/2 hours!  Also I used whole wheat flour.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

WOW! This was great! I made an apple pie with this and I could have just ate the crust. It was very easy to work with... this was my first time at a crust from scratch. Just keep the dough cold. Easy easy easy.

This wasn't the best crust I've ever had. I had high expectations though given all of the raving comments. I do love how simple it is, plus I would much rather use butter than lard. Next time I will use less water because that may be the reason that it wasn't very flaky. I didn't even use the full 1/4 cup that it called for anyway! I made sure to keep the butter, water, dough, and my hands very cold. I refrigerated it over night. It was pretty easy to roll out (another reason I think I used too much water!) This makes a 9-inch single layer crust (that isn't mentioned in the recipe). I will probably try it again to see if it turns out better next time.

Great recipe! I was trying to find one that didn't require shortening because I didn't have it on hand at the time and when I discovered this one, I was well pleased. I'm horrible with Pie crust but this one held together well, was easy to roll out, didn't burn like so many other crusts, and it tasted great after the baking process. I use it for fruit and meat pies and I'm never disappointed. Thanks again!

The suggestion I read about using a cheese grater to grate the butter into small bits actually may have changed my life forever (it certainly improved my pie crusts!)

Delicious crust - buttery and flaky. I have just one recommendation - do NOT refrigerate the dough overnight. Holy Moly, but that made it difficult to roll out. Unless you want to risk startling your family with curse words coming out of your mouth while you're rolling out the dough, just refrigerate for a couple of hours. Mine was in the fridge overnight, and I wound up having to beat it down with the rolling pin (while yelling lovely curse words).

This recipe is really a classic "pâte brisée" : 3 cups all-purpose flour; 1 cup (2 sticks) sweet butter, cold, and cut with a knife/grater into thin slices or shavings; 1/2 teaspoon salt; and approximately 1/2~3/4 cup very cold water. There are several ways to improve it, the most dramatic being to use (or make up your own) "pastry flour" : 3/4 Cup AllPurpose Flour + 1/2 Cup Cake Flour; ie., Blend by sifting the (much lower gluten) Cake Flour with the standard flour to make real "pastry flour". What makes the recipe a derivation of "pâte brisée" is that it uses all butter ~ of course, by doing so it is quite rich {grin} FYI, pie dough is even more flaky when some shortening is used in place of unsalted butter; ie., try the Alton Brown mixture of 3 ounces (6 tablespoons) butter, chilled PLUS 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) lard = shortening, chilled, with the 1-1/4 Cups of "pastry flour"... Butter adds "richness", while Shortening amplifies "flakiness". for what it's worth, I use 1/2t salt + 1T sugar in this recipe, with 1/4t (plain, white wine or apple cider) vinegar added to the ice water. There is surprisingly little difference when the shortening, and then the butter is cut into the pastry flour with the plastic blade of yoru food processor, or when done by hand, in my experience. However, there is a BIG difference apparent depending upon how you add the ice water! Even if you use your food processor to pulse-cut the fats into the flour, turn it out and add the water manually ~ pr

I'm a baker, but this was my first try at a pie crust and it turned out excellent! My main concern was flakiness, and it was very flaky. I doubled the recipe & added a bit of sugar & vanilla extract. Only refrigerated the dough for 40 minutes. For filling I used the Three Berry Pie from this website. My husband & I agreed that the crust could use some more sugar to go with the sweet berry pie. I may experiment some, but I know that pie crust baking is a fine science. For novice pie crust bakers I found the following hints helpful: 1. Roll the dough from the middle once, then slightly move the dough clockwise and repeat, gradually rolling the dough into a large circle. 2. After the circle is formed, lightly dust flour onto the dough circle. Fold the dough circle into a semi circle, then fold once more (into a flat cone-like shape). Gently lift the dough into the pan with the "pointiest" angle in the center and unfold. These tips really helped me make my first pie-making experience a happy one.

I have been making this for years.  Once you switch to butter from crisco...you'll never go back!  It's heavenly when prebaked when making pecan pie.  The big trick (an I'm sure lots have already said), is to keep everything cold!!!  I cut my cold butter into little 1/4th inch squares, then freeze it for 30 minutes. I also freeze the pastry cutter, flour and bowl that I use as well.  I refrigerate the water with the salt already mixed in.  After cutting the dough to small crumbles, I barely work the doughZ(it sill falls apart a little). I refrigerate that for another 30 minutes to an hour at least. Then letting the dough ball(s) sit out of the fridge for 20 minutes or longer, I make flat, roll it onto the pie plate, then pre bake it.  Smearing eggwhite on top of the crust while it's pre baking keeps it crispy and flaky when the pie is cooking so you don't have soggy crust :D

Oh  my goodness gracious. Yum. I consider myself a pretty active baker, but for some reason pie has never held much of an interest for me.  It never excited me enought to want to bother with it.  I think it's because I hate crust. It's boring and bland and not good, in my (previous) experience.  So when I've made pie in the past, it was usually half-heartedly, with a pre-made crust. In the last couple of years, I've started baking exclusively with butter, and it's opened my eyes. I can't believe how I ever got by on margarine and shortening! Anyway, finally got around to making my own crust with this recipe and my trusty new food processor.  Baked my apple pie using two crusts, baking till almost done, then brushing with an egg/cream mixture sprinkled with sugar, to make it pretty.  I am a changed woman.  Looked amazingly professional and gorgeous and tasted so good my eyes almost popped out of my head.  Now I must make pie. Lots of pie.

This was my first attempt @ a homemade pie crust & it came out delicious, buttery and flakey...just like my moms crust that's shees been making since I can remember. I used my kitchen aid stand mixer to make this since I don't have a food processor or pastry cutter and honestly, don't want to take the time/effort to cut the butter in with a fork. (I make my scones the same way!) I just froze my butter for about 30min, sliced it thin & then added it with all the ingredients except water in mt KA bowl. I mixed it on the lowest setting for a few minutes, until there were pea sized, or smaller, crumbs. Then I slowly poured in slightly less than 1/4cup of super cold water (still on the lowest speed) just until a dough barely started to form. Then I shaped it into a ball, wrapped in plastic wrap, and froze for about 30 min before I rolled it out. I froze it again once I got it into my pie plate, before I added my filling and baked it. it came out perfect. Even the extra scraps that I dusted with cinnamon/sugar and baked came out flakey without being refridgerated or frozen before going into the oven. This will be my go to recipe, I love it!

I have 4 years of formal training in foods and have since made hundreds of tender flaky crusts. I followed this recipe exactly, plus grated & refroze the butter, then baked the unfilled crust at 425F. degrees for 12 minutes. Butter bubbled & oozed out of the soggy flat disk that sank to the bottom of my pan. I read oodles of reviews from cooks who had a similar result. I think there might be faults with this recipe that show up most when it is used as a single prebaked crust. People who filled the pie before baking did not seem to report the same problem, but I notice that many of the pies pictured seemed to be pulling away or sinking at the edges. I am guessing that the extra fat from the crust is absorbed by the filling when baked as a filled pie. If you review this crust, would you please mention how you baked it and how you measured your flour (I fluff flour, then spoon into cup)Is this good only for a double crust pie? Does your bottom crust come out flaky, or just the top? I am curious enough to experiment with this one, especially since I'd like to get away from hydrogenated fats.

This is good, but the second time I used 50/50 shortening and butter and it was sublime!  The shortening gave this crust amazingly flaky layers, just add another pinch of salt since the shortening isn't salted.

So easy to make and rolled out beautifully with no tears.  Took the advice of others:  1)  placed water in freezer until ice crystals formed and 2)  put butter in the freezer for an hour and then grated it.  Then I put the grated butter back in the freezer to ensure that it was nice and cold before incorporating it into the flour.  Didn't have any problems doing the whole batch in my food processor (not at all "overworked").  Flakey and tasty!  I'll be using the recipe from now on.

BEST CRUST EVER. I use this recipe for everything!! I don't know how I ever got by without it. The flavor of the crust is divine, and compliments literally anything you put inside it. It is tastier, and a much healthier option than the pre-made crusts with partially hydrogenated oils and other preservatives. This is definitely a keeper!!

AWESOME! I have been looking for a pie crust made with butter instead of shortening that was light and flaky, this is it! I made the dough in my food processor and chilled the dough for around 20 minutes in the freezer while I was making the fruit mixture, it was a dream to work with. I doubled the recipe and got 12 large tarts and 15 mini tarts.
I made this pie crust again using half whole wheat flour the pie crust was just as tasty and flaky.

Fantastic! So flaky and tender. I put the flour in a bowl, then the diced butter on top of the flour, and put the whole thing in the freezer for about 15 minutes. I had to break up/flatten the butter chunks with my fingers (just moved, and all of my utensils are packed!), but the cold flour helped keep the butter from getting too soft. I even had to roll it out using a drinking glass, but it handled perfectly and is absolutely delicious.

I followed this exactly, except I didn't leave it in the fridge for more than about 15 minutes.  It was very good and very easy.  I used the recipe Apple Pie by Grandma Ople with it.  DELICOUS!

I use whole wheat pastry flour (or white whole wheat, they're the same). I do several dough balls, one after the other, flatten the balls into a disk, and freeze in a zip top bag. When I need one, I just put it in the fridge the night before. I roll it out using all purpose flour to dust the surface and the rolling pin.  If you roll it really thin, you can get a large disk and then you can cut off the edge that you don't need, and re-roll the scraps into a rectangle.  I use that to cut into ribbons and make an open  basket weave on the top of my pie with that (about 4 ribbons going horizontally, 4 vertically). It gets me a top and bottom out of one curst recipe. Enjoy!

This is wonderful crust. My first attempt at a homemade pie crust that wasn't a crumb crust. It wasn't too difficult. I doubled the recipe for a lattice pie. I needed a little more water than called for. Perfect. I'll use this again and again. EDITED LATER THAT DAY: Everyone loved this crust. Amazing flavor.

I don't know what went wrong. I've been making pies for a couple of years now, and I have a really good recipe going that uses half butter and half shortening. However, I've been trying to cut shortening out of my family's diet, so I was anxious to try this recipe. All ingredients were thoroughly chilled prior to using, and I only cut in the butter until the crumbs were pea-sized. I used the minimum amount of ice-water that was needed, adding only one tbsp at a time while lightly tossing together with a fork. The crust came out very hard, especially around the edges. No flakiness or tenderness whatsoever. We ate a little, then threw the rest of the pie away, it was that bad. I want to try it again, but at the same time, I don't know any pie crust tips that I haven't used already. Sorry. :(

GREAT crust!  I used this with the Grandma Oples Apple Pie recipe on this site. Fantastic and easy to make.  I followed a couple of tips that I read - I brushed a very thin coat of melted jelly (I used sugar free apricot) in the bottom of the shell before I loaded in the apples, and then I baked the pie in a glass pie plate on a pizza stone (suppose to help make sure the crust is completely and perfectly baked).  Hubby doesnt like crust, and he liked this! Its a keeper!

My brother and I are  die hard bakers (cookies, cakes, bread) notice I didn't say pies-that's because pie crust and us were NEVER friends :)  BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I FOUND THIS RECIPE I can NOT proclaim that any more.  I bake all kinds of pies.  At first I was using a popular brand of maragrine, but one day I didn't have any and all I had was butter.  Tried it and brother does it MAKE  A DIFFERENCE.   I know there's talk we should cut out butter, BUT SOMETHINGS YOU GOTTA use butter, and honey this is one you GOTTA USE BUTTER!!!  There is an apple pie recipe on AR if you combine these two together, you WILL win 1st PLACE everytime. Trust me you will be happy with this one.  Make sure your butter is CHILLED!!!  Happy trails/baking to all.  ;)

Just amazing.  My sister and I needed a pie crust recipe that didn't require shortening in a pinch. I found this, and it came out perfect.  I love this recipe because it is so simple and easy.  We didn't even refrigerate it for the time required (did I mention we were in a bind?!). Just popped it in the freezer for about an hour, and still it came out perfect. I just feel like this is one of those recipes you almost never come across: simple ingredients, easy to follow and hard to mess up.  This is now my go-to pie crust recipe. Goodbye, shortening!

Perfect pie crust! I only had butter in the house and don't like the idea of hydrogenated oils in shortening, so this recipe seemed ideal. With a food processor it took only a few minutes to mix into the perfect ball of dough. Was short on time so I could only refrigerate less than an hour, and still came out great. The end result was flaky, melt-in-your-mouth, with a rich butter flavor. I used to use ready made dough, but they are pricier and don't taste as good. I only had salted butter available, which ended up being fine. I also made this as a double recipe with no problem. Try this, and you won't be disappointed!

This was my first attempt at a homemade butter pie crust. I hardly handled the crust at all before putting it in the fridge, and I thought it wasn't going to turn out right (it didn't seem like it was all going to stay together), but it came out great. I do suggest putting the very cold butter in a food processor because it seems that the smaller the pieces are, the better.

The perfect pie crust!  I was looking for the perfect crust yesterday and this one was recommended to me...and I cannot be more grateful for the recommendation.  This crust was super easy and turned out absolutely to die for.  It is light and flaky and tastes absolutely delicious.  This will now be my go-to crust!

I love this pie crust recipe.  Best one I've ever made.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla to the ice cold water and I added 2tbsp of sugar to the flour mixture.  Buttery, flaky and delicious.  You won't be disappointed.

I love this!! I've never made pastry until now and this was super simple and turned out great! I added a little cinnamon for flavour.

Why don't people test their recipes before posting them here???  1/2 cup water was waaaay too much for this crust.  Probably 1/4 cup would be fine -- next time I will add it 1 tbsp at a time until it reaches the right consistency.  Definitely too gooey to roll out the way it's listed.

This pie crust turned out great! I followed another reviewer's advice and grated the butter with a cheese grater because I didn't have a food processer. (The butter wasn't frozen, just chilled.) I put the dough ball in the freezer because I didn't feel like waiting for four hours, and then rolled it out after 30 minutes. The crust turned out buttery, flaky, and delicious. I'll never used pre-made crust again.

I refrigerated for approximately 2 hours. I was extremely impressed by the delicious flavor, flakiness and ease of preparation with this recipe! Thank you so much, as it's just a wonderful accompaniment to any quiche recipe, and I will use it often!

I am a 65 year young mother of 5 and have made homemade pies for years.  Had started cheating by buying pre made shells due too not being able to get the perfect crust as when I was younger.  THIS IS THE BEST PIE CRUST recipe ever.  Easy to make (I do add a little extra ice watrer) and rolls out like a jewel.  Thank You

Liked very much-and gave 4 stars only because I think it needs a little sugar added to the mix.  I sprinkled a few tsps. of regular sugar on the top which added a little sweetness - and made a lovely apple pie today.  This would be fantastic recipe 'as is' for a chicken pot pie.  I am saving it and using this recipe for some pies I'll make for Thanksgiving this year.

Even if you have never made pie crust before, you should try this one! This was my first time and I loved it!  The ball really does form with the last Tbsp of ice water :) Doesn't even compare to a frozen store bought crust. I used my KitchenAide with the paddle. I took others advice and stuck my flour and salt mixture in the freezer for 5 minutes, cut up my butter and stuck it back in the freezer until I needed it, even stuck my paddle in the freezer to get it cold. Kept everything super cold so I didn't have to work at warp speed!

Easy to work with and ends up as flaky goodness.  Keeps intact very well.  I put in the freezer for a half hour and it is chilled enough to roll easily.

I used this pie crust for a cherry pie and it worked so well. I made double and it was still not enough though so I suggest tripling it or double and a halfing it. But very good and tasty and very easy to work with!

Came out perfect! Crust was flaky(I mean this in a good way- as in many layers of golden brown crust) and melted in your mouth. I substituted the last 1/4 of flour with pastry flour to make mine rise a bit more and added a tiny bit of vinegar to enhance the flavor (less than 1/4 tsp). If you do this, I recommend rolling the dough very thin as it puffs out a lot.  Delicious, would never use lard or crisco again. Thank you so much!

Good flavor, but the texture was extremely tough, in spite of taking great care to not overwork the dough.  Very disappointed.

i am awful when it comes to making pie crusts, but i have to say, i love this one, it turned out PERFECTLY. i read through the other reviews, and do not recall it calling for 1/2 c water as one wrote....and i agree with others, the key is to roll it between wax paper dusted with flour. it turned out delicious...thanks

This was the easiest pie crust I've ever made, and it turned out looking so professional!  I followed another reviewer's advice and used my microplane to grate a stick of frozen butter, then reinserted the butter into the freezer for a few minutes to keep it cold.  I think this trick with the butter was the reason I did not need to refrigerate the dough before I rolled it out.  I had no problem rolling the dough to the correct thickness and getting it into my pie plate without refrigerating first.  This is a prize winning recipe!

This crust is to die for! Flaky, and very flavorful! Plus so easy to make. I made no modifications except to double the batch cause there never seems to be enough.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it turned out great, despite using bread flour instead of all purpose because that is all I had on hand. I incorporated a reviewer suggestion as well...I froze a stick of butter and grated it with a box grater  coated with flour inside. The first time I didn't flour and it stuck inside.  I also grated it directly in the bowl of flour and stirred it in along the way so the grated butter coated and not stick together. The grating also made for little work to bring the dough together. The first time I returned the grated butter to the freezer, but it softens so incredibly fast, some stuck together. I used 1/4 cup of ice water as called for, which makes it easy to come together and roll out, but softened considerably by the time I finished rolling it out on parchment paper. After I flipped the paper over on to the pie plate and formed the shell, it was softened.  After placing in the refrigerator until ready to fill, it was perfect.  Next time I will freeze the pie plate to avoid the softening issue.  The recipe filled my 10" ceramic deep dish pie plate perfectly with nothing left over and only a scant lip, which is what I prefer.  The generous fluted edges are nice to look at, but tend to over cook and crisp and hence break off easily when cutting. I will try all purpose flour next time and would think it would turn out even flakier, but this recipe turned out such a tasty crust that I will definitely not need to look for another.

Excellent, flaky, melt-in-your mouth!! I made this for Grandma Opie's Apple Pie and it was my second crust EVER!
Helpful hints:
1.  The best crusts are those that are seemingly "too dry" initially.  Be patient and roll it out several times; it will come around!
2. Chill chill chill the poop out of your ingredients (i.e. ICE cold water, semi-frozen butter, even chill your flour and mixing bowl after sifting)
3.  Be patient and buttery flakiness will be yours :)

This recipe yields a crust that is difficult to work with and not very forgiving.  However, the end result is both beautiful (flaky and crisp) and delicious.  I will use it again and again--just know it takes a lot of time and skill.  Not for the novice.  Still, rated it a "5" for the results.

This pie crust was extremely good and flaky. The key(very important) is to keep all the ingredients very cold. I put everything in the freezer. I even let the water  turn to little ice frizzles.(not frozen) just as it begin to turn to ice I began making my crust. definitely a keeper.

I was out of shortening and needed a pie crust using all butter, and this one was perfect. I added more water, but other than that, it was an excellent recipe. It made the most pliable dough I've ever worked with and rolled easily into the size I needed, which was deep dish. It was rich and delicious, maybe not quite as flaky as one made with shortening, but I was not disappointed!

I had to go back and re-rate some pie crusts I've made from this website that I thought were good at the time, because this one is the best one I've made so far.  I've wanted one without shortening (transfats).  I doubled this recipe to make two single-crust pies; pulsed it in the food processor, and it turned out great.  It rolled out easily, and it was the flakiest crust I've made.  Thanks for the recipe, Dana!

Very buttery crust, just what I'll be using from now on to make pies with. I love this recipe b/c it is so easy, delicious, and contains NO shortening. You dont need much water to work with the dough, just dont overwork it. Thanks :)

Blah. Got HUGE bubbles after it baked. Had to break them to get the crust down. Also it shrank after baking and didn't cover the edges of the pie plate any longer. Also this recipe contains no sugar which many pie crust recipes do so as you can guess it was in no way sweet or flavorful. I also don't like how this recipe gives no indication as to baking temp or time so that you can use this with a pie recipe that calls for a prebaked crust as almost all do. I will not make this again.

I would've NEVER believed it!!!  Me, who burns toast 287 days of the year made a pie with crust to die for!!  The crust was absolutely simple to make, i wrapped it firmly in plastic wrap over night and in the AM it was perfect!  I used the advice in other posts of a well-floured rolling pin and surface.  Today apple pie, tomorrow, quiche lorraine---Thanks, Dana!!

This recipe seemed simple enough that I decided to bypass the pie crust I had in the freezer and give it a try. It was easy to put together, rolled out perfectly, and made a really nice crust. I used it for an Oatmeal Chocolate Pie recipe from this site.

I've never baked a pie in my life and I tend to be really obsessive about getting tips from everywhere before I make anything new. I used this recipe as a starting point and thank God it wasn't the only thing I looked at or my crust would have been ruined. First of all it should be emphasized that everything going into the pie should be COLD to get the flakiest crust. I read a tip from a review on this site to refrigerate the flour beforehand, cut up the butter and then refrigerate again, and use cold water with pieces of ice floating in it. At the time I didn't have a pastry cutter so I froze the butter and grated it and I learned the 2 knife technique from a nice lady on youtube. Work the dough as little as possible or it will be tough. The amount of water given here was not enough for me, but the nice lady on youtube taught me to add water in small increments until the dough had the right consistency. After refrigerating the dough, I learned I had absolutely no skill with a rolling pin. I gave up rolling it out and used my hands to press the dough into a circle (youtube lady again).

It sounded so good.  The first time I tried it for a pie shell I followed the directions and the crust came out like leather.  You could hardly cut it.  So I tried again, making sure of every step.  Same result.  What could I be doing wrong?

I consider myself experienced making pie crust (otherwise, why bother?), but was concerned about using butter and a food processer.  I decided to be careful, but not extreme.  I diced the butter and froze the pieces.  I put the food processor blade in the freezer an hour before I used it and ice cubes into the measured water.  After I pulsed the flour and salt, I poured the water a little at a time and pulsed after each addition.  The most helpful comment from other reviews was not to wait until the mixture came together in a ball.  When the mixture looked like coarse crumbs (without using all the water), I dumped it on the counter and formed a flat disc, touching it as little as possible.  It held together easily.  After refrigerating overnight, rolling it out was easier than expected.  I used a silicon mat dusted with flour.  I also dusted the rolling pin.  I just flipped the silicon mat upside down putting the crust in the pie plate and then pealed back the mat (it stuck a little; next time more flour on the mat).  The dough was softer than a shortening dough.  My usual fluted edge spread more when baking and lost its pattern.  Next time I will try a sharper edge.  The exposed crust edge was unbelievably flaky and tasted fantastic.  It was definitely lighter than a shortening crust which is much drier and denser.  The bottom of the crust was a bit tougher to get a fork through because I think I did not roll it out thin enough.  Can't wait to try again.

This was my first ever pie crust attempt that went along with my first ever pie/apple pie. I truly had no idea what I was doing and assumed it would be a learning experience/ disaster. After reading others' reviews I did everything people commented on frequently. I kept all my ingredients cold and continually stopped to keep things cold. The reviewer who suggested using a grater was my pie crust angel!! I beleive that this person made my flaky crust happen. I have no chopper, I did once but it has been lost in storage after several moves since the beginning of my marriage. Grating was the perfect way to evenly distribute balls of butter throughout the dough. I also heeded the other beginner who stated that the dough could be rolled out once and then brought back in again and rolled a second time. This made rolling so easy and smooth. The crust was incredibly flaky, buttery, delicious and so easy to make! I used this crust with the famous Grandma Ople's Apple Pie, and it was completely amazing, I couldn't beleive it was my first pie and I had done it. I will never search for another pie crust. This is it!

This was the worst.  I am noted for my pie baking.  I followed this recipe and was so dissapointed.  I have never made a crust with just butter.  I chilled it.  Did everything as directed.  It was not flaky.  It was slimy.  I wish I had saved the butter and used Crisco as I always do.

This crust has a fantastic flavor and was tender yet firm. I used it for pasties and it held up very well. Followed the recipe exactly with no problems. I didn't have the time to let the dough stay in the refrigerator as long as was suggested but it was still easy to work with (left for about 30 mins).

Really, really good. I used it for a chocolate pie and it turned out super good. I had to add a little more water to make it roll out neatly. Also, I added a little sugar. The crust was so good, even before i baked it, that my daughter and I were eating the left-over raw bits. I'll definitely be using this recipe again. Thank you!

I got a lot of compliments about the crust so it turned out well.  

However, when I was rolling out the dough, it all crumbled apart.  I was trying to keep the crust together like a puzzle and I was very worried about the end result.

Awesome flaky crust. Dicing up frozen butter can be a little interesting. But it ended up working in the end. True if you are using this recipe for a dessert pie, a sweetening ingredient may be desired. Also beware of applying a cover layer on the pie for when the butter melts and drips in the oven it will start smoking. Overall the crust tasted great and it would be a great decision to attempt.

So last night I decided to once again try my hand at making pie crust from scratch.  I searched and found this recipe. Of course I modified it slightly by adding cinnamon and surgar to the dough.  WONDERFUL!!! The crust was very flaky and very tasty!!!  Since this was an "experiment" I didn't use a lot of peaches for the filing...just in case. :)  I HIGHLY recommend allowing the dough to chill overnight before rolling it out.  This is a great Pie Crust Recipe! I can't wait to use it for other pie recipes....I will probably never buy a pie crust again!!

It is an easy crust. The taste is really good.  The butter tends to melt, dripping on the oven so I covered the rack below it with foil. Tends to stick. I used partly frozen butter once and I liked the results better.

DIVINE DIVINE DIVINE!!!!!!! TEN STARS! It was my first time making crust and it was super fantastic! I used frozen butter that I grated quickly and just blended it with the flour hardly touched it. Used ice cold water and barely blended it all together when I plopped it into the wrap to leave it over night about 5 hours. THen I just rolled it out tossed it into baking sheet, threw on some apple pie filling, threw another crust on top poked with fork all over closed edges, made too much glaze so bushed it and I drizzled it with the glaze and...HEAVEN!

I really like this recipe.  It's easy to make and turned out very tender and tasty.  I doubled the recipe for a two pie crust that I used with the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe.  It was fabulous!  I'm using it for a cherry pie today.  I'm eager to taste the results!

BEST CRUST EVER ! flaky, buttery and easy to roll out didn't crack. I used a little more water then what was stated in the recipe. But I kept adding until it was moist enough to hold together in a ball. I did it by hand with using a pastry blender.

I loved the ease and flavor of this crust recipe (I make only butter or TF-free margarine crusts), but it did seem to be a bit greasy to me. Could be the pie recipe instructions I was using too. As one reviewer suggested, I grated hard frozen butter, and then incorporated it as instructed (that was fun!). Maybe I'm just not used to a crust with a delicious whole stick of butter :) I usually make a "low fat" crust, using just a tbsp or two of light margarine, so it's thinner/crisper, and shrinks annoyingly. A+ for taste, but maybe a little less butter is needed? I'll experiment. **UPDATE 7/10 - I made this again and did NOT grate the butter (just chopped it in the food processor w/the flour and stuff) and it came out WONDERFUL! Created gorgeous double-crust and single crust pies. This is my ONLY pie crust recipe from now on :)

I have mixed feelings about this one. I made it for an apple-cranberry pie first. Whereas it was good, it wasn't nearly as light and ethereal as the Crisco recipe I've been using for almost 35 years. Don't get me wrong - it WAS flaky, just not AS flaky as crust made with vegetable shortening alone (I've always used ice water, ever since I started baking pies.) It was a tad heavy. My family said they preferred my "usual" crust. That said, it WAS more flavorful, which was only to be expected, given my use of unsalted butter.  However, it was when I made it as the base for a cheese and bacon quiche, that this recipe could really shine. So I wish I could give 4-1/2 stars. It seems to work better for savory pies, such as quiches and pot pies, than it does for fruit pies. Very good, dependable recipe.

i had never done a homemade pie crust before mostly because I had heard if you do this it will do this and if u forget this it will not come out right.  So I had just decided to not ever go there.  Well my luck ran out and I needed to m ake several apple pies and didn't have the ability to go get the frozen kind, but all the ingredients needed to make one.  I chose this one be cause i figured if I goofed it some how at least with all that butter it would taste good.  They didn't mess up at all this is the simplest recipe for pie crust I think i have ever seen and it is also the best tasting pie crust I have ever had.  This is now the only way I will make pie.  Oh and I made several batches because I needed multiple pies. In the end I had too much so trying figure out what to do with the extra(this recipe too good to waste) My kids asked for cinnamon crisps so i took the remaining batches rolled them out really thin put on cookie sheet and covered with strusel mix cinnamon and a drizzle of honey, baked at 400 for 10 to 15 minutes poking with fork halfway through to get rid of any bubbles.  I let cool for only a couple of minutes then cut with pizza cutter and it was the best cinnamon crisps i had ever made.  They were and instant hit

I have done already a cherry pie and multiple pumpkin pies with this recipes.  I did another recipe with cream cheese and it wasn't that bad, but still this is the best pie crust recipe ever!  Everybody asks me where I bought it and can't believe when I say I did it!

this is really good. i skipped the step where you have to wait for hours and just used it immediately and it was great. i used margarine instead of real butter, too. i just don't feel right using shortening at all, so this is really good.

Easily the most flavorful pie crust I've ever made, browns up nicely and has a wonderful texture!  Can't miss!  Instead of doing it the old fashioned (laborious) way I just put the flour, salt & butter into my stand mixer w/the heavy stirrer attachment on low & once crumbly added the ice water a tablespoon at a time until just right, formed a ball by hand and then off to the fridge it went in saran wrap.  Rolls out nicely, minimal separation at the ends, a lovely consistency to work with.

It makes me feel better to know there are so many others out there that have as much difficulty with pie crust as I do!!  I usually don't make my own crusts, as they tend to be hard to work with, and come out tough.  I tried this recipe for a strawberry pie recipe on this site, only because I didn't want to go to the store.....and I'm so glad I did!  Simple to make, and with ingredients found in every kitchen.  I try not to work with shortening, and the buttery flavor of this crust is to die for.  It's flaky and crisp, but without being greasy.  I used parchment paper to roll out the crust, and didn't use any flour, so it fell a little bit, but it's still pretty. I still have some work to do on my technique, but I'll never buy crust again.  Thank you so much Dana!!

What a great and simple recipe.  The key to a great crust, keep the water ice cold and roll out the dough a few times.  I did this a got a perfect crust and lattice top for my first apple pie.  I loved it.

This crust came out perfect for me using 1/4 cup of ice water like the recipe says.  It is easy to work with when you use a paring knife to slice the butter into thin slices.  Roll it out using wax paper and a little flour and it doesn't stick.  It was a crispy, flakey pie crust!

When I first made it I was scared to death that I would overwork the dough.  Don't worry so much about that.  It will turn out fine.  I put the butter and the water in the freezer for several minutes to make sure they are cold. Instead of a pastry cutter i use two knives to cut in the butter (slice them through the butter, toward myself until they hit the bowl.  Do this quickly).I use a fork to add the water but then I work the dough with my hands, after running them under cold water.  When you get the ball of dough out the next day, it will take a very long time to get soft enough to work with, so plan on that.  Roll the dough out between two sheets of wax paper...this makes it so much easier.  It has a tendency to break apart a little but that's easy to repair.  Sometimes, I roll out the dough between the wax paper and then refrigerate overnight.  It takes less time to warm up and works just fine. What you want to see are areas of butter blobs in the crust.  This is what makes it flaky. This crust has been perfect for me every time.  It's the only pie crust recipe I use.

I haven't tried this with a dessert pie yet but I used it for quiche.  I noticed that there was no cooking time or temp so I just tried 325 for about 20 minutes or until slightly golden.  Then I baked my quiche for about 20 more minutes and it turned out perfect.  I'm saving this recipe for future use for sure.  No alterations either, perfect recipe as is.  Just make sure your ingredients are cold and you poke your crust before baking.  It also helps to have a weight or something to prevent bubbles.

So delicious. I used Earthbalance butter, which is vegan.
I accidentally just baked it without putting dry beans in the center, so it totally puffed up, and the sides slouched. But it's totally fine :) Also: I put all ingredients in the freezer to get cold. And I only refrigerated it for 2 or less hours. 
Buttery, flaky crust, JUST like it says :)
Make it, and enjoy. :)

I doubled the recipe so I could have a top, and a bottom for my blueberry pie and I had some leftover! I made an apple pie with the leftover crust! Well, back to the crust...It is yummy, flaky, and perfectly crispy. My family raved over it! I made a blueberry pie with mine and when it came out of the oven, I brushed it with melted butter and sprinkled it with cinnamon-sugar. That pie didn't last long!

I haven't made a pie crust since high school home ec almost 20 years ago. I know how difficult they can be to get right so I was nervous! I wanted to use butter instead of shortening and found this recipe. I'm sold! I only had salted butter so I omitted the salt. I also took a commenter's suggestion and grated the butter with a cheese grater then re-froze for several minutes so that it was extremely cold. The amount of water you will need varies. Work in 1 tbsp at a time with a fork. I believe mine needed around 5 tbsp. I only had around 45 minutes to refridgerate and it did not slow this crust down. Made a double crust and Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe!

I am not sure if I overworked the dough or not. It was very difficult to roll out, very crummy. The crust was very tough and not flaky at all.

It was my first time with any kind of pastry and I was totally spooked by the stories of how difficult it is to get right! I don't have a pastry cutter or a food processor to use so I just cut up the cold butter and worked it in the flour with my hands. Despite all the horror stories and inexperience, it turned out perfect. I used a trick my mom taught me, and rolled out the dough between two sheets of clean plastic bags. That makes it easy to transfer and it doesn't stick to anything. Also, keeping it well refrigerated helps, but I didn't even need to leave it in overnight, just 15 min in the freezer plus an hour in the fridge. Great recipe!

Couldn't be better.  I used one reviewer's suggestion and put the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes instead of waiting 4 hours.  It was a little weird at first but with a smidge of patience I got it to roll out beautifully.  The texture was taste and texture was perfect too.

Simple. Makes a great crust for chicken pot pie. I keep some sticks of butter in the freezer and grate them with a cheese graterover the flour mixture to make it easier to incorporate.

A good every day crust.  Replace a table spoon of water with a table spoon of cider vinegar to help make the crust flakier.  The vinegar helps prevent gluten from forming.

This crust tasted good, but despite following the directions to the letter, I had issues. I made the crust exactly as specified (added an extra 1/4 tsp salt and glad I did), and even left it overnight. I used only cold items such as chilled flour/salt, frozen butter grated with a cold cheese grater, bowl and pastry mixer all taken from freezer. Did not overwork it. Mixed up quickly to keep it cold and not overwork the dough. Mixed the exact amount of iced water, formed a ball, wrapped in plastic and chilled for 14 hours. I then rolled it out twice per other suggestions, then put in pie tin, with crust laying over the sides of the dish. Precooked for 20 at 375 (not enough time if you are doing a cold pie that will not require more baking!) and it shrank like a &@$+@^€!!! At least 1 inch in from where it was. It only filled halfway up the sides of the pie plate. I had to make due because I didn't have time to do another one. As I said, the flavor was good, but if you are doing a pre-cooked crust, cook longer and in any case,  roll the crust out so it hangs more than an inch over the sides! The recipe should state this!

This has become my go to Pie Crust I use if often, really basic and easy. Great taste and texture. I use it for pies, both sweet and savory like Chicken Pot Pie as well as Peach Cobbler and have not been disappointed yet.

I doubled this recipe to make a lattice topped fruit pie.  Amazing results!  My no fuss method was to place the flour and salt in a food processor then I cubed the butter which I had in the freezer and pulsed it until the mixture resembled bread crumbs.  I then added all the water at once through the shoot while the food processor was running and the mixture turned into a dough. I removed the dough from the food processor dusted it with a little flour, rolled it into a ball, wrapped it in plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge.  What a flaky and delicious pie crust!

I've used this pie crust recipe more times than I can count, so I decided that it is about time I write a review. This simple recipe yields a tasty and flaky crust every time. 

I typically end up using a little less than 1/4 cup of ice water and rarely let it cool for more than 2 hours. Nonetheless, it always tastes wonderful. This is an easy and fantastic recipe.

loved it! it was perfect for my cheesy spicy tuna turnover! i followed the ingredients exactly as written. also, i noted the advices of the other reviewers to make sure the butter, the water is really really cold. also to ensure that the dough is  cold and to not work it out too much. it was buttery and flaky. i made small cheese puffs with it too :-) yum!!! thank you for sharing this!

This recipe is SUPER easy to make, and it's literally the ONLY crust recipe I can actually get to turn out and cook correctly.  It tastes great and I love it!  I'll never use another recipe again.

The only modification I made is I used half the amt of water called for.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

Requires far more water than the recipe suggests, held together poorly.

I froze the butter, grated it, then refroze it for a total of about an hour before putting everything together.

*I even substituted a bit of the butter for margarine since I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough butter.

I refrigerated the dough only for about 1 hour. It was easy to work with and not tough at all. This was my first pie dough, and it came out perfectly with my pot pie.

Came out very nice.  The "Ready In" time really should reflect the fact that you have to refrigerate it for 4 hours!

This recipe was fantastic! I have attempted pie crust a few times before and have always struggled with it, but this recipe worked for me! I made a triple batch, refrigerated the dough overnight, then made the crust in the morning. The crusts were nice and flaky and the dough was not too hard to work with. This is my new go to recipe for pie crust!

I love to bake and have for years...but pie was something I always would avoid for fear of duplicating my horrible crusts of the past.  I made this one last week for a fresh blueberry pie...it was phenomenal.  flaky, delicious and successful!!!  Will be using again and again.  Never fear a pie again.  :)

Not sure why but the crust was chewy... crunchy. Good... but not exactly right. Maybe I'll try it again and see what happens...

This was a fantastic pie crust, it came out flakey and full of flavor. I made a few minor adjustments- I did not have a food processor so I grated in the butter after leaving it in the freezer. I also added 1 extra TBSP of ice cold water. I did not have time to let it set for 4 hours and started working it after 3. It was perfect! Would highly recommend.

YUM-MY!  That is what my son said to this crust!  Excellent recipe!  I took the advice of others and cut the butter into tiny pieces and then froze it for a few minutes.  It made the process quicker.  All in all I would have to say  GREAT RECIPE

Great crust!... but it needs an old baking sheet under it so the butter doesn't melt and drip all over the bottom of the oven and make a mess.  Very easy to work with!

Wow, this pie crust is absolutely perfect. I used it for a homemade chicken pot pie but it would be good on just about anything. I followed the recipe exactly but I used a food processor. The dough took about 1 minute to make. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a perfect pie crust in a pinch.  Very easy to make and oh so flaky.  I didn't have time to chill the crust before making, but it turned out amazing even then.

Absolutely delicious crust!  I agree with freezing the diced butter for a while before using.  However, I did not refrigerate the crust before using, just used it immediately.  I turned out so flaky and fabulous!  Super easy and just plain good!

I've never been good at making pie crust, so I always buy the pre made ones. I gave this an attempt and it came out perfectly! I don't have to spend $4 on premade ones anymore!

The key to making crust, the less you work the dough the easier it is to work with. I learned this from an autobody mechanic when I was a kid, he said, "dont play to much with the body putty" ....add water, make a ball, roll it out and flatten..

So easy, so reliable. I love this recipe. It works easily into flour and rolls out smoothly. With all the changes in Crisco, my old recipe stopped working for me. Crisco no longer has transfats, but somehow it makes the dough crumbly. Using butter, I never have to worry again. Well done!

I've always used a pie crust recipe using eggs, vinegar and bking pwdr until my husband mentioned (after 20 yrs LOL) that he doesn't prefer "cakey type" crusts. So I tried this one today w/ quiche.     I'll NEVER go back. This was so easy I didn't change a thing, which is unusual for me. I made it entirely in my Kitchenaid, the dough was a bit soft but rolled out on a floured stone beautifully. It was flakey and had a great taste.     Thanks for a great  recipe.

Thank you for this! I doubled the recipe to have a top and bottom crust. Turned out fantastic! After the four hours rest in the fridge, the gluten was very strong. I had no problems with tearing while rolling it out. The butter was still cold with noticeable bits in the crust which causes a beautifully flaky buttery crust! Very light and very YUMMY! Thanks so so much! (PS - I used 2 cups AP flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour for my two crusts)

This crust had a good taste, but it rose too much for me in the pan. Rolled out it was 1/16th of an inch thick, but after baking it was at least three times as thick. Plus, it wasn't flaky at all. I will stick to my shortening crust recipe.

This crust is amazing! I made two batches on Thanksgiving for pecan &  pumpkin pies and both came out better than any I've ever had! I don't have the pastry utensil to cut the butter into the flour so I used a potato masher (that looks like squiggles instead of the grid) and it worked much better than going at it with only a fork. My only issue was with rolling it out. I tried one chilled and one unchilled. I think I had better luck with the unchilled dough even though it was sticking to my rolling pin (sprinked some flour down). The chilled one shrank in the pie plate when pre-cooking it, so I had to put the rest of my pumpkin pie mix in a container to freeze. Regardless, this will be my go-to recipe for pie crust!

Was REALLY easy to make in my food processor, but kept bragging about how I made the crust from scratch.  Everyone loved it.  My dough was more sticky than crumbly so I think I added too much water (ahem, didn't add it a Tbl spoon at a time, but will next time).

So easy to make and use it should be illegal. Only note was be sure to use unsalted butter and if you don't lay off the salt. Best part of this crust is that it only has 4 ingredients!

Wonderful recipe. I doubled it and used the food processor to cut in the butter, just pulsed four or five times, then I transferred to a bowl and added the iced water gradually, I didn't need the full amount. After letting it chill for the recommended 4 hours, I let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes before rolling out. This is the first crust I've ever made that I had no problem with cracking when rolling. It was beautifully flaky and my husband told me look no further you've found the perfect crust. Thankyou for a real treasure Dana.

I altered the butter to 1/4c shortening and 1/4c butter to get the best of both ingredients, the richeness of the butter, and the flakey-ness from the shortening.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL CRUST!  Someone else suggest that, if the edges crumble when you roll it, fold them back into the center and continue rolling to size.  Works like a charm!  Thanks!

Finally!  My battle with pie crust is over!!  I cubed the butter, and froze it for about 5 minutes while I measured the flour, salt and iced down my water, and used a processor.  OMG!  Better than grandma's.  (sssh, don't tell).

I liked this recipe a lot. It had a great texture and taste. I added a bit of sugar and worked great.  For people who's dough shrank, you should let it rest after rolling it out for about an hour. And to the people who thought it was too watery- the amount of water in doughs depends a lot on the humidiy and temperature outside. It's best to add water a little at a time with all dough recipes.

Oh my, this is SO GOOD! This is the very first time I baked a pie crust, and it turned out so mouthwateringly delicious! The pie tastes exactly like it's title suggests: buttery and flaky YUM,!! I did what everyone suggested: chilled the flour, diced butter and all bowls and utensils in the freezer before using, and took care not to overwork the dough. Will be making this again!

I love the buttery taste of this crust. It's convenient for me because I never have shortening on hand. Instead of refrigerating for four hours, I freeze the dough for 20-30 minutes and it rolls out like a dream. Easy to work with, tender and flaky!

This crust comes out perfect everytime. You don't have to chill the dough if you don't have time it rolls out just as easy and cooks the same. An easy tip if you don't feel like using a pastry cutter is to use very well chilled butter and grating directly into your flour with a cheese grater(the larger side) then just stir together. It works great.

Practice makes perfect.  The first time I made this recipe I didn't sufficiently chill the butter or the water.  Dough was okay but greasy.  The second time I made sure the butter and the water were ice cold and I chilled a stainless steel mixing bowl to make the pastry.  The results were amazing!

Ooops! I forgot to rate this recipe and give the author credit for such a wonderfull crust. I will never use another pie crust. This crust has such a great taste that I think shortening wouldnt be able to accomplish. thank you sooo much! Be sure to use cold ingredients. I stick the water in the freezer just before I mix the flour and butter and its always very cold when I need it. Update: i have made this crust over 15 times, the more you make it, the better it comes out.. it requires some tecnique but i think its impossible for it to be bad. remember.. this is key!: just add water until the mixture forms a ball, not a wet ball, but not one that falls apart. and dont be afraid to use your hands when adding the butter to the flour, i have found that "pinching" the butter works better than a fork :)

I tried, unsuccessfully, to keep this very cold. I fould that by the time I could easily roll it, it was too warm to tranfer to the piepan. I will practice this one. I agree that it could use a touch of sugar.

If you are going to go through the process of using very cold butter, cold mixing bowl, ice water, etc this is a great pie crust. Great flavor and very flaky as the title suggests! Great with any pie...much better than shortening. I suggest brushing the top with either an egg wash or melted butter so it gets nice and golden brown.

I have never made a pie crust with butter instead of shortening....and I will never use shortening again.  This is the winner for us.  It was so flaky and buttery.  Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but had to double because of what I was making.  Definate keeper.  Thanks for the post.

This was the first pie dough I'd ever tried to do. It seemed easy enough, so I wasn't too nervous. I read and used tips from other reviews, which helped greatly!! I also used a trick borrowed from Alton Brown--I grated the stick of butter on a large cheese grater instead of dicing. Turned out great! I'm so glad I read the review that said the first roll out would be crumbly, because it was. But the second one worked perfectly!

Flakey, buttery, pretty much perfect crust. 

I made a double batch to make a 2-shell pie. Used 1 1/2 cups all purpose white flour and 1 cup all purpose whole wheat. Came out wonderfully. 

CUTTING IN TIPS: I cut butter into small chunks and put in freezer for 20 minutes before cutting into flour. I was carefull not to overwork and even left a few larger chunks of butter, to avoid over working. I actually cut it in with my finger tips rather than a pastry cutter. After tossing in the water, it still looked very dry but I was able to squeeze it into a ball. I put in freezer for 1 hr and then fridge for 1 1/2. 

ROLLING TIP: When beginning to roll the dough after refrigerating, It was obvious that it would be very crumbly and not stick together after the first roll. The larger chunks of butter tended to stick to the pin and counter, but I regularly applied more flour to the top and bottom. Rolled out to 1/2 and inch thick, then folded the sides in to the center to re-form a thick disk. 

On second rolling, I rotated after every 2 rolls, applying more flour to top and bottom as necessary. It was very stiff and took quite a while to roll out. Perserverence paid off in an awsome crust that was easy to work with once rolled out the second time.

Great recipe, there were a lot of good tips from other members.  I'm fairly new with 'from scratch' crust, I'll need to work with it a little more, I don't think I roll it out enough because it seemed thick last time I made it.

I'm a novice when it comes to pie crusts. This ended up pretty doughy, and after spending the night in the fridge, I did not have the hard ball that everyone else is talking about. It was pretty soft. I couldn't get the dough to form a ball with only 1/4 cup ice water, and used more like 7 tablespoons. I want to play with this some more and see if it can get it to work better for me as I loved the flavor of the crust, and love the idea of a trans fat free crust. I used light butter instead of regular and wonder if this may have been the problem. I'm giving this a 3 because as said, the flavor was good, it was just the consistency that wasn't so great, and since I'm fairly new to pie crusts, it could have just been me.

I tripled this recipe and froze the additional dough in portions! Wow! Flaky, light, not tough and perfect for dessert pies or a breakfast quiche! Very easy. I used my countertop mixer hoping it wouldn't mess it up and it was perfect! Thank you!

Great recipe for those who don't like the bitter flavor of Crisco.  I modified this recipie for Quiche.  Used a third Whole Wheat flour, the remainder all purpose flour.  Reduced butter by two Tablespoons, and added two Tablespoons Sour Cream.  Added a Tablespoon sugar, then, as crust was almost rolled out completly, I sprinkled a small handful of rolled oats onto the crust, pressing them into the dough with the last few passes of the roller.  There was enough dough to create a lattice top on a 10" Quiche dish.  Delicious!

Following the recipe as written, I had flour left over in the bottom of the bowl that wasn't "stuck together" with the butter & ice water. It wasn't as easy to work with as a crust made with shortening but I'm trying to eliminate shortening completely in my cooking so I still prefer it.  The crust after baking was a little tough .. almost crispy at the edges.

This pie crust was great! I have to admit I was a little skeptical because this was my first attempt at pie-making EVER. But I was drawn to the recipe because it doesn't call for shortening  I think I might try adding a hint of sugar next time to give the crust that extra UMPH! Plus, I cheated. I didn't even refrigerate it! I was just ready to bake, so I popped it in the freezer for about 15 minutes, added my pie filling, topped with the lattice, and put it in the oven. WHOO HOOO! Great recipe. This one's a keeper...good for the taste buds as well as the heart! Thanks for sharing, Dana. We love you. XOXOXO :)

This was my first "from scratch" pie crust, and it turned out perfect.  Reviewers that had problems with it being too gooey should realize that the recipe calls for 1/4 cup by the tablespoonful.  I didn't need to use an entire 1/4 cup of water. Rolling it out between two sheets of parchment paper makes a perfect crust.

This was wonderful. The pastry was buttery and flakey. I added some sugar & vanilla as I used it for an apple pie. Also doubled the recipe to make a double crust. It didn't shrink at all during baking. Will use this recipe again.

I cut the amount of water and omitted the salt, feeling the dough as I rubbed the salted butter in with fingers. Where I live is really humid so more water would have made a heavy and sticky dough. To prevent shrinkage, I placed the rolled out pastry in the freezer for 15 min then directly inserted it into the oven. Buttery and very melt-in-the-mouth! Used it for a quiche.

This is one of the easiest recipes. It is also very good. It can be used for a variety of pies. I went through so many and this one was one of the few worth it. I felt compelled to leave a compliment as I have been using this recipe for about a year and it always comes out perfect.

Hi all, 
I am kind of new at banking. I found this recipe for pie crust and thought it seemed simple enough. I baked three pies for this past 4th of July party and several pies since Thanksgiving. Every time I use it, I get mega compliments on my pies (mostly the crust). Just a quick tip: Crust comes out even flakier if you keep butter and dough as cold as possible. Also for newbies such as myself :-), when making a recipe that calls for baking the crust before you put in your filling, remember to use pie weights! That was a big oops! :-)

This recipe saved my Thanksgiving. I am terrible at making piecrusts. For my Lemon Meringue I cheated and made a 2-pie crust recipe for one.  I made one 2-pie crust for the Apple (I didn’t have enough Crisco to cheat). Well, the dough was too tough (too much flour I guess – as always). It was not rolling out to cover the pan.  I couldn’t go to the store because my husband had our car, so I desperately searched allrecipies to find a crust that used butter only (an ingredient I did have).  This is the one I found. I followed the directions exactly. Dana’s Grandmother has gotten this down to a science because this crust is a dream.  It rolled out beautifully, I can’t believe it. The transfer to the pan was effortless!  I had enough crust to form a nice edge!  Use ice water and let it chill like she says. One of the crusts was too sticky, but once I added floor to roll it out, it was fine.  The crust won’t be as flaky as a Crisco crust, but it does add a nice flavor. Everyone was raving about the crust.  To be honest, I really don’t plan on making another crust again and only use this recipe.  You have found the dream crust I assure you!

Simply Delicious!  Maybe the two negative reviewers should learn how to read the recipe more carefully.  I had no problem at all, this is the best pastry crust i've ever made.  Thanks!!:o)

I was suprised at how easy this recipe was.  I added only the 1/4 cup of water.. and found it was not enough.. kept adding water until it was the correct consistency.  Was a breeze to roll, tasted great!  Thanks for a recipe that uses butter instead of lard or shortening.. neither of which I keep in my fridge.

Delicious crust! I never have much success with pie crusts & only chose this recipe because I had butter on hand, but it turned out perfectly the first time! It is probably one of the best pie crusts I have ever had. I, too, was disappointed with the negative reviews.

I found this to be a great recipe....and I was very disapointed with the other reviews...The recipe calls for the correct amount of water and try rolling out your dough in flour and maybe it won't be so sticky......I liked this recipe very nice.

This was a great crust. We used it to make pastry/Empanadas filled with sweet pumkin. On the second and third batch we did add sugar to the dough...this gave the crust a sweeter taste for the type of empanada we were making! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Favorite crust recipe!  Made it twice so far, and turned out perfectly both times.  We've used it for a pot pie and for quiche.  Trying it today with fruit for Pi day.  Thanks for this recipe!

Perfect. I've used this recipe at least ten times (I love to bake) and doubled it each time, following the recipe exactly. It's perfectly flaky, buttery, and works great for apple pie, sweet potato pie, pecan pie, etc. I put my water, mixing bowl, butter, and pastry cutter in the freezer for 5 minutes before making the crust. This keeps everything good n' cold.

Absolutely delicious and super easy.  Made for chicken pot pie.  Eggwashed the bottom crust and baked for 5 mins at 400 degrees before filling, also egg washed the top crust.  Took the suggestion of another commenter and grated the frozen butter with a cheese grater, it was hard work but worth it!  Used the leftover bits for a chicken pot "pocket", even after the dough was warm and handled- it rolled and baked beautifully.  The key is to keep everything as cold as possible when mixing this dough.  My new official crust!

I would give this crust a 4 1/2 star rating if possible. Only because I found it to be a little fussy when trying to roll it out. I was afraid that I would overwork the dough and make the crust tough. Fortunately after a little coaxing it rolled out and made a delicious butter crust. So happy to have shortening-free crust options! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and rolled from the center out turning the dough a little between each roll. Another "keeper," from Allrecipes! Thanks Dana!

Way too much butter! Totally ruined my apple pie. Not sure what went wrong but butter pooled on top of my pie, dripped out on the cookie sheet below then to the bottom burner. I didn't do a braid, just a regular top crust. Smoke everywhere!

i have tried different recipes but this one is easy, quick, and oh so tasty.  As others have said - Everything should be cold, do not overwork, and chill.  All is important to have a nice flaky crust. I saved the extra that I cut off, put on a cookie sheet, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and back for a few minutes. YUMMY. This recipe is a keeper.

I found only sprinkling 1/4 cup of ice water i wasn't getting a dough at all but just really crumbly flour. ....so I added much much more....is this usual?  Possible that my house is too warm or something?

I used this recipe to make my very first from-scratch pie crust yesterday, and it turned out AMAZING.  In fact, I can't believe how well it turned out for a first pie crust.  The pastry is so buttery and flaky, and it holds its shape incredibly well. I used this recipe in conjunction with the pie section of Joy of Cooking, which gives a plethora of helpful info on mixing, rolling, and forming pie crusts.  In a nutshell, it seems to come down to the following: (1) think COLD.  Everything should be cold, from the utensils to the ingredients to your hands. Since my apartment tends to be warm, I even threw the bag of flour in the fridge for a few hours before I started.(2) Mess with the dough as little as possible. Cut the butter in just enough to make large crumbs, no kneading or excessive stirring, and use the least amount of strokes rolling it. (3) Use just enough water to allow the crumbs to come together. No more. I liked one user's suggestion of flicking the ice-cold water in with tines of a fork. It distributes the water well while preventing the dough from getting too wet. This is the perfect recipe for a beginner like me!

Pie crust was my nemesis all my life I always bought frozen... I decided to bite the bullet this past winter while making pasties, this recipe.is phenomenal! Made my first crust for actual pie this past Saturday, my pops thought it was store bought and loved the lemon meringue pie. Tomorrow is turkey pot pie time!

This was awesome! I used mostly vodka (it had been sitting in my freezer since new years) instead of water, and i had to use a bit more then a 1/4 cup, but it came out sooo good! I was afraid it might have been to dry because the dough was a bit crumbly and the edges where kinda cracking, but nope.

I have made this recipe almost a dozen times in the last month for a variety of different pies, quiches & homemade "pop tarts."  It's delicious, flaky & very easy to make.  I pulse the flour & salt together in my Ninja food processor, add the butter & pulse until it's all cut in, & then transfer it to a bowl where I add the water.  Comes out perfect every time & this is officially my go-to pie crust recipe.  Thanks!

I am not a baker, but decided to bake a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving.  I chose this recipe for the crust and it was delicious.  There was a lot of cursing going on through the various steps and I think I ended up adding a LOT of water in step 1 and using a lot of waxed paper in step 2 and could've used a lot more flour for dusting my rolling pin in step 2, but it turned out great regardless of my unladylike behavior and numerous attempts to ruin it.  I did use an egg white wash on the crust before filling and baking it.

Awesome. Very tasty. I am not a pie crust person, but this I liked.
one thing I did differently though was not put it in the fridge at all. I put it in the freezer for about five minutes and had no problems. One suggestion is after putting the pie crust in the pan, place it in the oven for about 10-15 minutes. So it is a little golden but not brown before putting the pie filling in. This helps so that the crust does not get soggy. :)

Not sure why but I had to use more water than it calls for just to get it to stick enough to form a ball. Hoping m crust won't be tough

This is a great recipe. I used my kitchenaid mixer instead of a pastry cutter. I froze my unsalted butter then used a cheese grater to cut up the butter. It worked great! The crust was flaky and buttery!

Hands down this is the absolute best pie crust EVER! Even for savory dishes like chicken pot pie. The key is super cold butter and ice water. Also, don't work it too much, that develops gluten and makes for a "Bread-ier" tougher crust: not what you want. Stir in ice water til just mixed and use cold cubed butter you'll have perfect flaky crust every time. Also love this for Apple crostata!

I have made this dough 5 times now and I love it! It is so easy and tastes great. I made it for apple pie. I made it crumbly using a kitchen aid instead of a food processor or a dough blender. Each time I made it I refrigerated it overnight. The key is to not add too much water. Add the water slowly until a dough ball just forms then form the rest of the dough ball with your hands.

I have never made a pie crust from scratch before, and it turned out perfect.  Just make sure your butter and water are cold.  I made a double batch for a chicken pot pie IX off this site, and it was so heavenly.  I used a food processor for everything and processed the water in it until it was crumbly and able to stick together. This is definitely my go to recipe for a pie crust!  I even ran out of all purpose flour and used almost 3/4 cup of quinoa flour in place and it was perfect.

Made this crust for pumpkin pie. Everyone LOVED it! Make sure you add in only a Tablespoon of water at a time, as the directions say!!! I grated the butter in as someone has suggested and it worked out Great!!! Will be using this again. If you want a little flavor 2 table spoons of lemon juice instead of water.

Dough easily comes together using the pulse feature on a food processor.  Do NOT prebake this crust without any filling in it!!  Your sides WILL collapse!  Roll out almost as thin as a burrito tortilla.  You'll also want to make your crimped edges pretty thin because this crust will puff up a bit and you'll lose the crimped shapes.  You may want to go with just a "forked" edge (although this may burn quickly if not covered with foil). Kind of crunchy rather than tender and flaky.  Maybe I added too much water though.  I did add a tad bit more salt (maybe 1/8 tsp) for extra flavor.

I absolutely loved this recipe! This was my first time making my own pie crust, and I'm glad I saw this amazing recipe! I watched the "Buttery Flaky Pie Crust" video on this site to give me a visual. I doubled the recipe to make two crusts. I poured water in a cup and added plenty of ice, and let it sit for about 5 minutes, to let the water get really cold. I didn't have a pastry cutter, so I used a butter knife and a fork. I ended up using 4 Tbs of water for both crusts. I formed two discs/balls, and refrigerated them in two separate bags for about 2 1/2 hours. I let the dough sit on the counter for about 5 minutes, until it was soft enough to roll out. I used the crust for the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe on this site. It tasted amazing! I will definitely use this recipe again for my pie crusts in the future! The hubby and kids were very pleased!

Heads up - after chilling the butter, and the dough too much - this was never cooked when part of a 40 minute at 400 degrees apple pie recipe. next time would definitely pre-bake this before using for a recipe.

I have never made crust before but I thought I would try this one because the ingredients were simple and I had everything on hand. I followed the directions to a tee, I tried not to handle the dough too much and I let it sit in frigde overnight. The crust came out chewy, dense and very heavy. I'll stick with my old reliable frozen store bought kind.

This was the first successful pie crust I've made. I've ruined quite a few :) Although, I'm not sure if my success can be attributed to the recipe or the tips and tricks I've accumulated over the last couple months of reading reviews, blogs and watching cooking shows! 1) freeze and grate your butter 2) cut your frozen grated butter into your flour/salt with the food processor 3) use ice cold water 4) mix water in 1 tablespoon at a time by hand until your dough sticks together in a ball. 5) wrap in saran wrap and refrigerate and roll out according to recipe

Following these tips it came out perfectly flaky and golden :) (doubled it to make a double crust)

The result is 4 star (though not flaky) but the directions are a solid 2 :( I am not super experienced with pie crust, though I have made a few good ones before. With that said, I have a few questions... At what temperature does this need to bake? Do I need to pre bake it? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY does this recipe make enough to have a bottom AND top?!?! The answer to that one is yes, but only if you keep it simple! I prebaked the bottom for a pot pie recipe (IX) and it shrunk a bit. Ok ok not a total disaster, just rolled out the rest and covered it all up. Simple, nothing pretty, got the job done. I recommend "Mums Irish Apple Pie" for an amazing crust with great flavor!!!

Perfection! (Didn't use all of the water though and was impatient so stuck the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes to cool before rolling.)

Good pie crust recipe, not the best I've had. This recipe is really only enough to make the bottom crust, not enough to put on the top. If you want your crust to be soft and fluffy you have to barely mix/stir the crust. You really shouldn't stir at all. Use your hands!

I used this for a savory turkey pot pie and it was so awesome! Really flaky with great flavor. Will be my go-to pie crust.

Flaky, delicious, and best of all super EASY! I used this recipe for my turkey pot pie and my family said the crust is the best part of the dish.

Seriously, the best and easiest crust ever. I find that if I want to make a top to the pie, then I make 12 servings instead of 8. Best crust ever!

This is the best crust ever! I would give more stars if I could- it is so tasty, very easy to work with and only 4 ingrediants- what more can you ask for. I have used this recipe with my apple and pecan pies- to die for to say the least! I no longer make the main dishes for holidays as my portion are now the deserts.

I used this for my pumpkin pie but it tasted quite raw. Next time I will prebake this crust. Otherwise, the outer parts of it that I managed to cook thoroughly tasted alright, but not very flaky. Second time, it was more flaky, but still tough. :( I need to work on my pie crust handling techniques, probably...

My husband said this was the best pie crust I've ever made. I'm not expert at rolling out any pie dough, so I can't complain too much about it being sticky. The crust (although patched together) went well with both a pumpkin pie as well as an apple pie made with Splenda.

I am not sure why but my dough was very sticky. I am thankful I have experience in pie making and was able to just add a few things here and there to make it the right consistency. Other then that I would say this recipe was very good! My friend loved the turn outs. :)

Very, VERY tasty and easy. It was very generously sized on my HUGE pie. I made it exactly to the recipe, in my food processor. I chilled the dough for 1 hour and sprinkled the rolling pin & counter with flour to prevent sticking.

Awesome pie crust recipe!  It is as it says "Buttery Flakey" and so good I even ate the outside edge of the crust!  Simple and delicious.  This is a keeper, for sure!

This crust is sooooo stinkin' good. I make mine in a food processor. Add all ingredients but the water and pulse till mixed in. Then slowly add the water till a nice ball forms. I needed only a bit over half of the water. Also, it is so easy to handle, I only needed to refrigerate it for 15 min, maybe less before rolling it out. I made two double batches for two strawberry-rhubarb pies. So perfect and so tasty. Beautiful crusts. Wow, I can't say enough! Tastes like a nice, flaky, unsweetened shortbread.

easy recipe. I rolled out the dough between  two sheets of saran wrap and only let the dough rest for about two hours. The dough was quite tough, but I just read that is due to too much water nd I did add more then the recipe called for, so next time I will try not to did that. Anyways, I want to try again with longer rest time and less water, work with hands briefly, like I do with biscuites, to get the ball without adding so much water. The taste was excellent. grated cold butter and put in the freezer until ready to use. I think that worked well.

Very easy dough to make and handle. I did add (2)tbs of brown sugar into the mix before adding butter and water. Other than that, total awesome... I've made this 3 times and have consistent results each time.

It's a good recipe. I always double it and freeze the extra crust; it's just as easy to make, and it's great to have a crust ready to go in the freezer. I don't have very many kitchen gadgets, so I freeze and grate the butter into the flour mixture, which works great. It's fast, easy, and effective.

This was my first time making pie crust and I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't have a food processor so I cut the butter into cubes and froze them. It was hard making it by hand, but worth it. I watched a video on youtube on how to make pie crust and that helped. I would make this again. :)

Great and simple recipe.
I just wish there were baking instructions for it, as the recipes i've come across ask for a baked pie shell.

I made this crust for a chicken pot pie.  I used my food processor and 50/50 butter/smart balance sticks.  It turns out great and was pretty easy to make.  Will definitely use again!

So tasty I even like eating my leftover dough scraps.  Made this crust for Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe on this site. Made lattice top crust. Turned out fantastic and very pretty.  Diced my butter and put in freezer for 15-20 minutes. Also put water in freezer for a few minutes. Cut in butter with hands at first (not too long!) to get large chunks, then used pastry cutter. It was easier for me to make well in mixture and add the water all at once rather than one tablespoon at a time.

VERY VERY GOOD!!! I was looking for an all american crust recipe and this was PERFECT!!! So flaky and buttery (even though I used half butter half shortening), my pie was the best in the bunch. I don't have a pastry cutter, so  I used a big kitchen knife to cut up the frozen fat with the flour on my counter, like chopping herbs. It was weird not kneading the dough to blend in the butter chunks, but this step is very important! Love love love this recipe, already saved in my family cookbook!!! Thanks for saving our thanksgving:-)

Trust the recipe!  I was so nervous going in.  I didn't want to get the dough too warm, mix too much, add too much/not enough water, etc.  But I followed the recipe and it came out perfectly!  My mother-in-law also brought a cake to our meal and hers obviously had a store bought crust.  My crust was 100% better!  Hers was very fake tasting - almost like a shortening after-taste = yuck!  I will never buy a frozen pie crust again.

PERFECT pie crust, and easy!!!  Didn't fall apart as we rolled it out and fashioned it into the pie plate as all of the other recipes do.  This is definitely a keeper!!

This crust turned out perfect! We are staying in  temporary housing and all my gadgets are in storage. I had to use a fork to cut in the butter.  I had chopped the butter into tiny cubes first, then let it chill a bit in the freezer with the ice water. After blending the butter into the flour/salt with  the fork for a bit, I used my fingers to blend it to a fine crumb and then set it in the freezer for a few minutes to chill a bit more before adding the ice water. After adding the water, I let the dough chill for  an hour.  I didn't have parchment to roll it out, but I used floured plastice wrap. I pre-baked the crust using a coffee filter weighted with rice to hold the center down. I let it cool before filling it with pumpkin pie filling and baking with foil folded over the edges.  This crust got excellent reviews. It was flaky, tender, and tasted so much better than one made with shortening. This will be my new pie crust recipe. Thank you!

I've been trying to keep the holiday baking slightly healthier.  As we try to eat healthy during the year, the holidays can leave us with a tummy ache.  I wanted a recipe with no shortening and with whole wheat flour.  I simply used the recipe below but added an extra 3 tablespoons of icewater to make up for the whole wheat pastry flour I used!  Excellent flavor and texture.  WW tends to get chewy in crusts I have tried in the past but this one was amazing.  Thank you for sharing!  It went great with my pecan and pumpkin pies sweetened with honey instead of sugar or corn syrup!

The best crust I've ever tasted!  This crust was perfect for my apple pie and my sweet potato pies for the holidays.  My family and friends rave about it!  I am old fashioned and come from a family of professional chefs; I made this dough all by hand!  No food processors, and no cheese graters!  I rolled it out using a wooden roller.  I guess that I just have patience.  This dough turned out perfect every single time!

I really liked this recipe. It was easy to make and use. I followed some of the review comments since I couldn't wait the 4 hours and put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. It is definitely easier to use COLD. Baked the crust cooked evenly and was delicious.

I just made this and am waiting for it to finish chilling. While making it I noticed that while in the food processor, even with the very cold butter (I had the butter straight from the fridge), the flour/salt combo balled with the butter only about 3/4ths of the way through adding it. I added the rest but added barely any of the 1/4 cup of water (maybe 2 tablespoons) as I was afraid of it becoming too moist. Granted, this is one of the few times I've made pie crust, so I could have messed it up by adding not enough water, but we'll see.

I used this recipe to make pop tarts and also for chicken pot pie. The pop tarts turned out great and I really enjoyed the crust with it. It was very buttery! However, I did not like it with the chicken pot pie. It was too puffy and the leftovers were soggy. I have made the pot pie with a different crust that was the right texture fresh from the oven and left over. It was worth the try. I will still use this recipe for the pop tarts!

Unless I am missing something; I don't see a baking temperature or an amount of time in the oven.  I simply guessed it was 350 degrees until golden brown and it seemed to work out ok.

SO wonderful, thanks so much!  Beautiful flavor, and the lattice I put on my pie stayed perfectly through baking, and looked so pretty with a little egg wash and sugar sprinkled on top.  I overworked it and accidentally added a little more water than called for, so it was a ittle tough in some spots - be careful only to use a little water, and I wouldn't worry about making it into a ball - just get the water in it and stick it in the fridge however it ends up, just to prevent doing too much with it.  I will certainly make this again!

Amazing! I have been a little unlucky with pie crusts in the past, and I even messed up again the first time I tried this recipe. After tossing out the first crust(too much water, then too much flour) I read a lot of the tips in the comments and tried again. I doubled the recipe, weighed the flour(personal preference), diced the butter into small pieces which I froze for a bit, and kept the water in the freezer until I saw ice crystals. I used my fingertips to rub in the butter(I have a light touch and slightly cold hands), and only used about half of the water. It ended up sitting in my fridge for 2 days and it was absolutely wonderful when I was rolling it out. I used this to make a cherry pie and it was delicious and very flaky.

LOOK NO LONGER for the perfect crust. This is a dream to make and eat. Coldness is a good idea... I froze the butter and grated it with a cheese grater because I don't have a pastry cutter. It is flaky, buttery goodness.

I made this with 'extra fine whole wheat pastry flour'. It turned out flaky and good, but I think I might add in a little bit more salt and a little bit of sweetener next time.

Perfect!! I used this to top a chicken pot pie. It was buttery and flaky, and super easy to make. My only problem is that it was too small for the top of my pie dish. I had to roll it thinner than I would have liked and had to pull it and push it down onto the rim of my pie dish, hoping it wouldn't shrink. It didn't, so that was good. But it was great! Next time I'll double it :)

I am used to making crust with Crisco but now that I am living in Spain it is no where to be found!  I tried this crust and it was AMAZING!  Very flakey and delicious and easy to work with even though I made a huge rectangular pie and my first lattice top.  Eveyone also enjoyed it and the crust was several peoples favorite part.

Best pie crust recipe I have ever made.  Even my picky husband comments on it every time.  One small word of caution.  For Thanksgiving I decided to get a jump on things and make my pie crusts early.  I made 3 of these, refrigerated them overnight and rolled them out for my pies the next day.  I would not recommend doing this with this particular recipe. Every crust was extremely hard and hard to cut.  I have used this recipe numerous time before and never had that problem. They have always been very flakey and buttery.  Only chill for the recommended time.

We doubled it and used it for a double crust. The crust was WAY too thick and it wasn't very good. However, it was eaten. I won't be making this again.

This is the first and only pie crust that I can make time and time again with NO problems.  It mixes in the food processor perfectly, and rolls out with no tears.  It also bakes to a beautiful golden color and it flaky every time!

I use this crust for all my pies. I absolutely love it! I don't understand why it is giving so many people problems.  I mix the flour and salt together then I cut in the butter with a knife and add about 4-5 T. of water.  I then mix it well with my hands till smooth (I even knead it on my countertop)then roll it out to size constantly patting both sides with flour so it won't stick to the counter. I then use it right away (no refrigeration). Once it's placed in the pie dish and the edges are pinched decoratively, I fill it and cook according to pie's directions. Never had a problem with it!

chibi chef, your technique is genious!! Aside from the flakiness, the flavor was outstanding! I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening, and added 1 tsp of sugar because it was for a sweet pie.

Okay, I'm giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt because all of the great ratings -- so 3 stars for it.  However, if I was going only on my experience with it (maybe I did something wrong?), I'd give one. Blah and chewy...not worth the time put into it!  Sorry!

Let me tell you....I have made SO MANY crust recipes.....and have yet to come across one as good as this.....so easy...I can't believe I never came across this one......it is definitely a keeper....the buttery flavor just can't be beat by crisco or butter crisco....you can't duplicate the flavor of REAL BUTTER!!!!!!! The texture was right on...buttery, flaky, rolled out very easily.....delicious......

I followed the recipe exactly and it produced a flaky, tasty crust for my deep-dish pie, as well as enough extra dough for a couple of extra tarts. I will be using this recipe again!

Great recipe to start from...these are the directions I use though: Combine flour and salt well. Cut cold butter into small chunks. Put butter in freezer for ten minutes, then add to flour mixture. Cut in butter until mixture resembles course crumbs. Place in freezer for ten minutes. Roll out on wax paper.  Press evenly into bottom and sides of 9-inch deep dish pie plate.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Poke bottom of crust 2-3 times spaced evenly with a fork. Bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before filling.

This was my first pie ever. I could not believe how easy it was to make and how great it turned out. It was a little tricky cutting in the butter, but I just kept cutting the butter smaller and smaller as I mixed until it got to looking like the coarse crumbs.With 3 apples left over, Im going to try apple turnovers today using this same pie crust recipe.

I haven't made many pie crusts, so from a novice perspective, this was very easy to make.  I made several crusts in one day and I noticed that each needed a little more/less water, but easy to do following the directions.  I wasn't big on the flavor though.  It was flaky, but, for me, laking in flavor.  Based on flavor, I would give this 3 stars, but because the recipe turned out perfect and was easy to follow, I gave it 4 stars.

The flakiest! I used the idea of one person to use a grader to shred the butter. It came out even better the second time. Thanks for the great recipe and tips!

I was looking for a crust that woupd not be "soggy" after making a meat and veggie pie, and I was nearly out of shortening! Wonderfull crust. I use unsalted butter for cooking, so the taste may be a little salty if you don't. My sister said it was a little much when she made it. She has since made it with unsalted as well and we are hooked. I don't think we will ever make a traditional "shortening" crust again!P.S. Make sure you refrigerate it for the prescribed amout of time...or even longer, or you will have a gooey mess.

This is a fantastic recipe! It's just like the crust from Whole Foods' bakery. My family loved the buttery, flaky crust.  I followed the advice to freeze and shred the butter and it worked perfectly. I did not measure the ice water but instead just added as needed to form the dough ball. Great recipe!

this is the second time i made my own crust and i was a little scared cause the last time didn't turn out so well. However, this crust turned out so excellent. It was the perfect texture and didn't get soggy. i also listened to one of the reviews and spread egg whites on the crust to keep from getting soggy.

Wow! So simple and delicious. I softened the butter to make it easier to mix and it still turned out great. I'm so grateful for a recipe without shortening, as I can't seem to find it here in Europe. I'll never go back to store-bought crust or shortening-based crust. Thank you.

I have never liked pie crust until now!this is absolutely the best crust i have ever eaten & the easiest i have ever made! 
i'll never buy another premade crust from the store again! 
i used a metal mixing bowl,put it in the fridge so it would be cold before i started,i used ICY cold water, and popped the bowl back in the fridge as soon as the dough formed into a ball.
i didn't have time to let the dough rest as directed, so i just left it in the fridge for 20 min. 
i worked QUICKLY with it,so the butter bits in the dough didn't melt!
it turned out AWESOME! even the bottom was perfect, not soggy from the fruit in the pie!
this recipe is THE BEST!

This was really good and easy to work with, tastey and flakey.  Had to add a bit more water, but there really is never any set amount of water you should add.  Add water gradually until it's workable.

I have been making my own pie crusts for a while now, and was always searching for that perfect crust. I can now say that I have found it!! My only comment is that I had to use a bit more water then suggested.

I have to give this a 5! I was worried after reading all the reviews that this would be too hard for me to do...I've never really done pie crust before, and there are so many reviews claiming that this is not a recipe for a novice. Well, never fear novices, as long as you follow the recipe to a "T", there shouldn't be any problems! The pie crust was amazing, flaky, and perfect with my quiche! I even had to cook the quiche for an hour and a half at 350 and it never over cooked itself. I just used a pastry cutter, gradually added the ice water and mashed it into a ball with my hands. I did roll it out onto a pastry mat, and i didn't even have to roll it twice. Perfect the first time! Thanks!

This was the best tasting pie crust I have ever had!!  The tips on freezing the flour and using ice water were very helpful and I'm sure they made a big difference.  I also put my mixing bowl in the freezer prior to mixing as well.  It was a little more work than most pie crust recipes but well worth it!!  This is the only pie crust recipe I will ever use!

Even though this recipe already has so many glowing reviews, I'm going to add my own two cents.  A crust this good should be a controlled substance, seriously.  I had been looking for a recipe like this for quite some time, and finally found this one over the weekend.  Absolutely divine!  As others have said, don't over-work the dough.  Don't try to work out those butter clumps, since that is what makes the crust flakey.  Most of the bigger clumps will even out when you roll the dough.  This crust will work for just about anything, quiche, pie, pot pies, etc.

This is a great recipe for those of us who can't find shortening where we live.  The dough was extremely easy to make and came out flaky and delicious. I had requests for the recipe my first time making it. I'll definitely keep making this pie crust.

I haven't had much success with pie crust in the past, but this was fantastic!  Very easy to put together, it rolled out beautifully after only chilling for 30 mins.  Flavor is lovely.  I only wish it was crisper on the bottom!

If you want this delicious crust to be flaky, try combining the flour and salt and butter in a food processor.  It will turn out perfect, so Tasty!

Very tasty crispy crust.  I added just a tad of shortening (couple of teaspoons) to the upper crust, instead of the extra butter that one reviewer recommended.  Made it nice and flaky, and not chewy at all.  Also used plastic wrap both under and above, to roll out crust - made it super easy to work with.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I don't know about the flaky part but it was tasty for sure.  Unfortunately  i think I will go back to my recipe with shortening and pretend it doesn't have trans fats.  I dont make a pie that often and I love a pie crust that truly is flaky.

I liked the flavor and the texture.  It was a little hard to work with, even though I chilled overnight, but it cooked great with pumpkin pie.

Made an error first time I made this crust. I used 2 cubes of butter instead of one for the top crust.  Second time I did it right.  My error was better.  Add another 1/2 cup to the top crust. It's great.

This gets 5 stars just for leaving out the shortening! Mine wasn't very flaky, but I'll definitely be trying it again and giving it another shot.  I baked it for a little bit before adding the pie filling.  The flavor was very good.  I find that my other recipe (shortening) never really tasted like much.

I just made peach turnovers with this recipe.  I doubled it, and ended up having to use quite a bit more water than called for.  I didn't even refrigerate it for long - only as long as it took to peel and slice the peaches.  However... the turnovers are beautiful, flaky as flaky can be, and so tasty the peaches aren't even needed.  Fabulous, thank you.

This pie crust is excellent, and has a rich buttery flavor, almost like a shortbread cookie. Despite other people's snottiness, I was out of shortening, and when I typed in "Butter Pie Crust" this was the ONLY recipe that fit the criteria, so thank you so much for sharing it!

I used this pie crust for my first attempt at homemade apple pir. It was absolutely perfect. I would suggest though, definitely let it sit in the refridgerator overnight. I let it sit for only 4 hours when in a rush, it was good, but definately it turns out better if it sits overnight.

I made my first perfect crust!  Tried many times and it just wasn't happening.  So a couple of weekends ago I was making do with what God left in my fridge and I made the absolute best quiche ever.  Seasoned spinach, asparagus, red pepper & onion with plenty of pepperjack, colby & cheddar in THE PERFECT BUTTERY FLAKY PIE CRUST (from Allrecipes).  I drained the veggies so the crust wasn't soggy.  And we loved it.  My low-carb was out the window that weekend, but I got over it. I'm just so proud of myself.

This pie dough makes a very tasty and easy to work with crust.  I've been making very large amounts of it for double crust pies, and there is more than enough to go around (after three double crust pies the trimmings are enough for one more single crust pie).  In my hot region of the country I find it best to cube the butter and freeze it before cutting into the dough, otherwise things get really pasty.  The dough is extremely sticky, but I love working in a big puff of flour -- I spread nearly a half a cup over my rolling surface once the dough has chilled, and of course more flour over the top.  Once it is rolled out, this crust is also very easily handled, even for the most intricate lattice tops.

Best pie crust I've ever made. Followed the advice of a review I read a kept butter super cold- froze for about 5m before cutting into flour and also froze water a bit. Then put rolled out crust back in fridge/freezer while rolling out and making other side as recipe only covers one pie crust- not a top and bottom. Abotu ro make again now and freeze for Thanksgiving.

One word: WOW. I am NOT a baker and have NEVER made pie dough. This dough was very simple to make and turned out beautifully!!! I only made one change: I used a food processor to blend the butter into the flour (but I still cut the butter into smaller pieces before adding to food processor.) This was MUCH easier than doing by hand with a pastry cutter.

I used half butter and half Crisco, doubled the recipe and made a Chicken Pot Pie. Very good! I'd like to make ahead and freeze the dough in plastic wrap and Ziploc bags. This would save a lot of time :)  Also... Instead of refrigerating the dough for 4 hours, I put it in the freezer for 30 minutes and it cooled it just enough for rolling.

Amazing Pie Crust.  Note:  I pulsed the cold butter and flour in food processor.  Transferred into bowl and added iced water by tablespoon until I could form dough into ball.  I did not pay any attention to what the directions stated about the water.  I added enough water until the dough stayed together nicely.  I wrapped in saran wrap and refrigerated for almost 3 hours.  Used flour to roll out for pie crust.  Placed in glass pie pan and blind baked for 15 min at 425 degrees.  Used 2nd pan as 'pie weight' to ensure bottom and sides did not shrink or puff.  I used parchment when blind baking.  Crust was flaky, buttery, and perfect for apple pie.  I'm not a great baker (beginner) and had NO problems with this recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This is my favorite pie crust recipe using butter instead of lard.  I love it.  The flavor is soooo good!  It is my new favorite!

I've never been able to make a flaky pie crust and quit trying and just bought them at the store.  I got this recipe in one of the emails that All Recipes sends me and I thought I'd give it a try.  I followed the recipe to the letter and I'm happy to say that it came out GREAT!  I may even try to make it again for my pies for Thanksgiving this year!

LOVE this recipe. I followed the instructions as written and even had a few hiccups.  I didn't have a pastry blender, so I used a fork. I finely diced the stick of butter (maybe 1/4 inch cubes) to help the process. I didn't have a rolling pin, so I used a coffee mug. Lightly dusted the counter top with flour--no ice bag, no pre-chilled working surface, no running cold water over my hands to keep them cold. Rolled it out for about 1-2 minutes and done. Maybe the fact that the temperature in my area is around 60 degrees helped. Even with my shortcomings and improvisations this crust came out flaky and amazing. Highly recommended.

Tip I was given.before mixing put all ingredients in a  bowl (minus the water separate cup) in freezer for 5-8 minutes..before I begining mixing..I just use my hands to mix also add a table spoon at a a time of ice water. When done you should have visible small bits of butter in the dough - this makes the crust flaky..love it 2nd time using this recipe.

I made the dough just as written x 4 to make 2 chicken pot pies.  I had to add about 1/8 cup extra cold water which isn't much considering it's a quadrupled batch.  I grated the COLD butter.  I quit kneading as soon as I felt I could get it into a ball.  Divided it by 4, put in the fridge.   I was afraid it wasn't coming together, but KNEW it would be a problem to add too much water.    Squeeze it together and it will come together.  The dough rolled out really nice  after being in the fridge about 40 minutes while I made the chicken mixture.  I think this will be my new go to dough vs. store bought, it was that easy! Great buttery taste and flack.

Easy and just like my grandma's tastes.
 Here are some tips, I think technique is everything with pie crust: 
- Use unsalted butter only . I would only use salted butter as a last resort, if you do have to use it, omit the salt in this recipe or its too salty for a sweet pie.
- Freeze the butter first, then grate it, then put it back in the freezer for 15 mins before you add it to the flour.
- After the butter and flour are mixed, put the bowl back in the freezer for another 15 mins
- Add only enough very cold ice water to bring it together, it should be together but still crumbly. Add a little, stir, and see if you can move most of it with two hands. If you can, it needs no more water.
- After it is chilled in the frig, if it is still crumbly you can always add a little more ice water at that stage.
-  If you are pre-baking for a cold sweet pie, add an egg or cream wash and sugar just before baking. My preference is egg wash.  

- Below are directions on how to actually cook the crust:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Prick bottom of crust all over with a fork. Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Line with parchment paper, and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges begin to turn golden, about 15 minutes. Remove weights and parchment. Return to oven, and bake until center is golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Let cool completely on a wire rack.

Made as directed and tried not to overwork the dough. The less you handle it, the better it is. This is the only pie crust my Piecrust Hating Husband has ever eaten. Ever. He normally scrapes out the filling and throws away the crust. Not this time. OUTSTANDING!

Wow, just wow!! I made this pie crust with Grandma Ople's apple pie and it was fantastic! I kind of gave up on homemade pie crusts and hadn't baked a homemade pie in years. Most of the time if I made a pie, I like the filling but was never satisfied with whatever new pie crust recipe I tried. Well I finally found the one!!

I have been searching for the perfect pie crust and I have to say today I found it! I think a lot of it has to do with the technique. After reading many of the reviews, here's what I did.

 I measured my flour and placed it in the refrigerator with my pasty tool for 30 min before starting. I also diced the butter and placed back in the refrigerator until I was ready to start. Once I worked the butter into the flour to resemble course crumbs I used iced water and added it a tablespoon at until it started to form a ball. Then I started pressing the dough into a ball added a few drops of water as needed until it formed a nice ball. I didn't kneed it. I then flattened the ball into a disk and wrapped it in plastic wrap. 

I refrigerated it for 2 hours. It was too firm to roll so I set it on the counter while I prepped and mixed the pie filling (I used the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople from this site. To Die For!) I would say this took about 30 min. I actually made 2 batches and used the second batch for a lattice crust on top. When I rolled it out it was nice and smooth with only a bit of splitting along the edge which will usually be removed any way. I sprinkled brown sugar on top of the crust which created a nice crispy sweet molasses flavor. I baked it t 350° for about 55 min.

The crust came out nice and flakey. My husband's favorite part of any pie is the crust and he said it was the best one he ever had. I will definitely be making this again!

After 45 years of making pies, who knew this crust even existed!  This is by far the best crust I have ever tasted. I used it for my Apple pie and the crust is so crisp but luscious with all that butter!  Thanks for sharing. I think the idea of using the right amount of water is the key. It seems like it won't come together but does if you're patient!

I doubled the recipe, took 2 sticks nearly frozen (salted) butter and and chopped it in my food processor, added the flour (no salt) and mixed in the processor.  Put into a bowl and added very little cold water.  Came together perfectly.  I have two beautiful balls of dough chilling in the fridge.

I've made this crust many times and it's practically replaced my grandmother's amazing corn oil crust. It's awesome, and not too hard to make. It's hard to find a butter crust recipe without sugar in it, and this one does quite well. One tip, don't skip the refrigerator step. It really helps to make the crust flaky. Also, I cut the butter sticks lengthwise on two sides and then slice it, makes for nice small chunks to work in. I just use my fingers, but small chunks of butter are key to working it in quickly.

Yum! I doubled this recipe for a black raspberry pie with lattice crust. It was very good! I wasn't patient enough to wait the full amount of refrigeration time, but this crust was still wonderful. Despite the gooey, juicy pie, this crust was perfectly browned, flakey, and crisp after cooling all night long. The bottom crust was not soggy at all. This is a keeper.

This recipe made a double crust pie for me.  I used rock hard frozen butter so I knew I would need a little more water (someone asked why they use more water).  For the water I just make a glass of ice water -- no need to measure because the flour tells me when to stop.  I also use the food processor when adding the water, but I use a pulse after each addition water; a very quick pulse and it will either stick together like dough, or need another addition of water. Don't pulse again out of curiosity wondering if there is enough water.  As soon as you have added enough water it will immediately look like dough after a very quick pulse pulse. I always roll it out between 2 sheets of plastic wrap -- throw a little flour on the plastic wrap so you can peel it off easily.

Really nice pie crust way better than store bought ones, may even go as far as to say its the best ive tried, SO easy to make it was my first time and they were perfect only down side id say is I doubled the ingredients because i wanted to make two small/medium pies but the pie crust wasent enough so i used it to cover my first pie, used a food proccessor type thing then my hands because the bottom was too liquidy i just addded more flour and it was great, i think i cooked it for around 45 mins then put it at a warming heat till ready to serve, i put it at gas mark 4 but the oven was heating something else at a higher temp so kinda preheated. AQnyway VERY VERY easy and tastes amaze , love it! way more appealing than something with vegtable shortening which i dont even think you can get in the uk.

I just made 5 pies with this recipe.  Increased with the adjust pie recipe to 40 people.  This recipe turned out awesome.  I left the pastry in the fridge overnight and took it out about 40 mins before I used it.  It rolled out perfectly and tastes wonderful.

I used this crust to make muffin tin pumpkin pies, and one crust made exactly 12 pies. It baked to done in 30 minutes. And let me tell you, it was absolute PERFECTION and incredibly easy. This was my first homemade pie crust ever. I'll never use a refrigerated pie crust again (they're too finicky anyways :P). I was a bit scared that the butter would shrink them down as it melted, but they stayed a pretty great size. And, to be honest, I got a kick seeing all the speckles of butter throughout the dough. I added about a tablespoon of sugar as well. It rolled out super easily, and super nicely. I also made a large pie, and I could easily scallop the edges. It's easily the prettiest pie I've ever made. This is going to be my go to pie crust recipe for life, I can just tell!

AMAZING RECIPE! This is my first successful attempt of making a pie crust. It was so flakey. Absolutely perfect. After cubing my unsalted butter I put it back in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I also put my pastry blender in the freezer to chill for about 15 minutes. I didn't use all of the water.

Oh My Gosh!  I've been looking for a good butter only pie crust recipe and this is it!  I've been making pie for decades and have never found that truly flaky crust.  This is it!  I followed the recipe & it's the best crust I've ever made!

Perfect crust! I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a deliciously flaky and buttery crust. I chilled all ingredients, including the flour. At first the dough is hard to roll out, but keep turning it and it will become more malleable.

Excellent crust!  Very flaky and easy to work with.  Double batch makes enough for two pies with two fancy cut out crusts, or three full pie crusts! Thank you, Dana!

Used this for an apple pie last night. It turned out perfect. I hand blended everything and it came together nicely. I didn't end up using all of the water though, only about half of what was called for. Thank you for sharing.

After being in the fridge for 4 hours, it was a really hard ball, but after I smushed it and stuck it to my pie plate, it turned out very well. I think I might should have rolled it out and put it in the pie plate before refridgerating.

It worked, but it was not easy. I had to add extra flour- I was trying to use margarine instead of butter, I'm sure that had an effect because margarine is soft even after refrigerated, next time, I'm going to use a recipe that calls for shortening. I wound up finishing this in my food processor. I used this for a quiche. It was good. My boyfriend asked me to make him a plate full of crust all by itself. This was my first time making a crust. Thank you for the recipe.

This was the best and easiest pie crust I've ever made.  I mixed it by hand and I did not refrigerate it.  I greased the baking dish and pressed it into the dish with buttered fingers.  Made an apple pie, used the same crust recipe for the top, but added cinnamon and brown sugar and made a crumb crust. Baked it for 50 minutes.  This crust was crispy and delicious! Will use this recipe from now on.  I think the real butter made the difference.

I have been making this pie crust for a few years now, with perfect results every time. One thing I change is that instead of refrigerating the dough for four hours, I pop the plastic wrapped dough in the freezer for an hour - no longer. It comes out perfect every time.

I was out of shortening and in need of a pie crust so I found this recipe - delicious!  I don't think I'm going back to my other pie crust, that's how flaky this one was.  Followed the directions exactly since I don't bake very often and it turned out really well.  Next time I'd like to have my butter chilled a bit more but I just didn't have time this go 'round.  Regardless, this crust was a lovely base for my tomato pie.  Thanks!

Used this for a pot pie and it came out perfect! Very simple and easy to prepare. Make it maybe the night before your going to make the meal, or dessert, give it time to really chill. Be careful with the amount of water you use! don't add to much or it will be too sticky! Use ICE water not just cold water, it does make a difference.

I overworked the dough in the food processor when I read all the reviews while the dough was resting in the frig.  It really didn't make that much difference on my pot pie and it came out light and flaky anyway.  It might have made a difference with another kind of pie but this one was great.  Thanks for the recipe that I will use again

I made this crust last night for the first time. I think it will take a bit more practice to make perfect.  I rolled the dough a little too thick.  But the taste was really good.  I will be experimenting with this recipe more in the future.

This was a FANTASTIC crust! I made it for a blueberry pie and my family just RAVED about it all (I REALLY loved it, myself!). I think I may have ended up needing more than 1/4 cup of water, though; I'm not sure, I just sort-of did it by eye. But regardless, it was such a great, well-matched flavor for the pie I made and I can't wait to do it again and again! So simple and cheap, as well. LOVE!

I made this recipe exactly as directed, except I was using salted butter, so I measured the salt scantly. It was amazing!! Even my German American mom who has made her own shortening based pie crusts for years said it was the best she had ever had and wanted the recipe.

Easy and versatile.  I use this for everything that needs a crust, and double it for things that need a double crust.  I've made lemon meringue pie, apple tarts, and cobblers from this crust.  FANTASTIC!  I just pull the butter right out of the fridge when i want to make some crust, quickly cut the butter into little pieces and slap the pie crust together fast with a pastry cutter.  Great!!

This was my first successful attempt at pie crust.  I followed the directions nearly exactly as written, except I mistakenly added 1 1/3 cup flour instead of 1 1/4 cup flour. It turned out perfectly. Light, flaky, buttery and delicious. I used it to make empanadas that received rave reviews.  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent pastry recipe. I have used if successfully for savory as well as sweet pies and it never fails. It can be made ahead for another day and kept in the fridge. Love this recipe. :)

This crust came out perfectly for me, BUT then came baking it.  It was for a custard pie so I needed to go ahead and bake it.  I didn't see any directions for baking so I pre-heated oven to 400 to bake.  When I checked it, it was this big slummped mess in the pie pan :(

Makes a nice crispy crust with good flavor. Just watch the water as you add it. Keep the dough on the dry side. I used it for quiche, and it wasn't soggy on the bottom after baking. I will try it next time for a sweet pie.

This pie crust is AMAZING! Very east to make and super flaky!
This was my first time making a pie crust and everyone loved it! 
I made sure to read everyone else's comments about it before i made it, glad I did! I definitely made sure the butter and my pasty mixer were COLD because that seemed to be what everyone stressed about. 
I will definitely be making this again!

So good! This crust performs every time. I usually have to cut in the butter with a fork which is a great workout and needs some extra butter to make the big crumbs. This crust is the only I will make and is a perfect complement to any pie.

This recipe is perfect. I don't bother putting water in the freezer. I just put ice cubes in my pyrex measuring cup. Then I fill it to 1 Cup full, and when I'm ready only pour out half. It doesn't have to be hard. Yum. Thank you.

This is THE best pie crust recipe! I have tried many over the years, ending up buying them premade and then just stayed away from baking pies just because I could never get the crust right. This weekend, i WAS determined to get it right and I did thanks to this recipe! This is the recipe I will always use. I ended up needing 4 T water. I let the dough chill only 1 hour and also all day-same outcome-a great buttery flakey crust! I did not roll the dough in between plastic wrap; I just used flour on my board with flour on the rolling pin. Watching the video helped as I alwys had trouble transferring the dough to the pie plate. Now that I have perfected this in time for Thanksgiving, I am going to find neat ways to decorate the pies! Thanks!

This recipe came out perfect with my homemade chicken pot pie! I even had to leave it wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge for a couple of days before I could find the time to make the dish and it still came out flaky and wonderful! Whoever gave this one a bad review must have done something wrong. I wouldn't use this one for a sweet pie, but for a savory pie, you can't go wrong with this recipe. I used (small) cubed, frozen butter and ice water. Only had salted butter on hand so omitted the salt. Still came out perfect! Thanks :)

This was the first pie I had ever made and it came out great!  I did make one mistake, I didn't realize that this made only the bottom of the pie crust and had to make the top quickly, with no time to refrigerate.  So, I made only have the recipe and made a loose criss-cross on top.  Then lightly brushed it with egg beaters and baked it.  The pie was delicious!!!

Buttery, Flaky, Tender. This is the Pie crust! I froze the butter and used a food processor. The recipe makes 4 hand pies. Just need Chef John to come up with a savory hand pie filling and i'll be set.

Okay, I am pretty excited with this recipe. This is only the second time I have made pie crust from scratch, the first time was a disaster. This turned out great. I followed a lot of tips from this site and it all added up to a great crust. I made enough for three crusts with some minor substitutions. I used 3 cups all-purpose flour and 3/4 cups cake flour, 2 sticks of butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. It took almost the exact amount of ice cold water called for. I made sure the butter and shortening were super cold (left them in the freezer for a little while) right up to the point I incorporated them into the dry ingredients. I folded the butter and shortening in with a pastry cutter and tried to work quickly and not overwork it. I added the water slowly and folded it in with a fork, again working quickly. When I made my peach pie I used a light egg white wash on the bottom crust and it kept it nice and firm. Amazing, since I have so little experience, but it turned out tender and flaky.

Great! Dubious at first because dough was not very homogenous before and after refrigerating. My son and I made little crust cookies to try the recipe out. Chilled half of the crust dough again just before baking and it was even more flaky compared to those that were not chilled right before baking. Obvious, but do not over work, the crust will not be as flaky. Very buttery flavor! Will definitely use this one for my next pie.

OMG!!! My first pie and I used this crust because it has the least ingredients. Turned out AWESOME!! My pie? Not so great but the crust is totally yum! No need for any fancy tools for this, I don't have a pastry cutter nor did I want to dirty up my food processor, so I used my natural tools, my hands. Came out GREAT! Will definitely be making more of these for all my pie experiments :D

This recipe was easy to make, came out light and fluffy and delicious and I will definitely make again!  I used a food processor, very cold butter and very cold water and handled the dough minimally.  It rolled out like a dream and was overall a great crust

Yummy & very easy.  I cut the butter in with a rubber spatula, then worked a little with hands.  AFter refrigeration was a little hard I was concerned but it did roll out fine.  I used unsalted butter, and felt like I could lay off the salt a tad, but one reviewer said she felt like it needed more, each to their own.  I needed all the water called for in recipe.  I used Iced water and the butter was cold out of frig. and diced small.

This is my go to pie crust.  It works up beautifully every time.  Once I mastered the light touch needed for pastry, it was perfect.  I love the buttery flavour most with savoury pies.  I find that you don't need to let it rest too long if you don't have time.

If you do not have a food processor or use shortening do NOT try this recipe. Dough comes out hard to use...too crumbly.

I chilled(in the freezer)everything prior to making this crust AND during!I used a pastry cutter and would intermittently stop and put my bowl in the freezer for a few min so my butter wouldn't melt a bit.I added water in tablespoon increments until it looked like big dippin dots then I flipped the bowl over onto a layer of plastic wrap, gathered all the buttery dots into a ball and twisted gave it a little squeeze and put it in the fridge for about an hour, took it out dusted my table (tried to not over handle the dough) gave it a few good kneads to bring it together chopped it in half and rolled 1 out!! I made a chicken pot pie with these and baked the bottom crust,washed with egg white,for 10 min at 375 degrees.I then filled that pre-baked crust with my delicious chicken concoction and rolled out my other crust tucked it under the slightly crisp bottom crust so it wouldn't leak,sliced slits in it,crimped the edges,egg white-washed and baked for about 35 min at 375 degrees.This WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I literally didn't even get a chance to take a picture and pretty sure I have to take everyone to the hospital for 3rd degrees burns to their  esophaguses. ENJOY!!!!

Made this afternoon to help find a use for a glut of apples. I have a small food processor so I blitzed the flour and butter together and then transferred it to a bowl to add the water and bring it together. Rolled out beautifully and baked up better than I could have expected!

Excellent for my beef pot pie recipe.  I recommend using a food processor if you have one to blend the dough.  Gets it done in a snap.

I've always been a bit intimidated by pie crusts.  We have some excellent cooks in my family that always make PERFECT crusts.  This recipe was super easy, flaky, and delicious.  All of that without the use of shortening or lard!
Definitely keep everything as cold as possible until you are ready to throw in the filling.  There are some excellent tips here on the reviews.  Butter/flour mix in food processor, chilled water in freezer, chilled working surfaces, etc.

Great homemade crust. So it made enough for the bottom like a quiche.  I used it for a savory tomato pie.  Strait forward no frills, but delicious.

This recipe is great! It is very flakey, almost like puff pastry. If you tried to make this and it didn't work, give it another try. Sometimes it may not come out right, just make sure you don't over work the dough. At first it may look like a shaggy mess, but  don't knead it. press it together into a disk, and fold over once or twice before rolling out again.

Love this crust!  
If blind baking, definitely need pie weights of some kind.  
Blind baking, bake at 425 degrees for 15-18 minutes

I made this crust for mother's day and it was easy to make but the recipe gave no instructions on how long to bake it and on what temp therefore this recipe was a flop since I didn't know how to long to bake it for!  I was very disappointed because I was really looking forward to it ):

I followed the recipe without tweaking. It was indeed super flaky, and my family was all very happy about it, but I personally thought it was a bit bland, though I can't imagine how to correct that. I might make it again.

Been making a crust very similar to this one for years (only difference is some of the flour is chickpea flour in mine) but the tip about ice water and chilling the dough really helped!  Great crust!

Great crust. The only thing I changed was the top part (on top of filling). I was too lazy to make a prettier top so I just ripped off little bits of the dough, flattened it a bit, and covered the entire pie with them. Try to cover as much space as possible, and it comes out great! Easy and quick way to make the top.

This did NOT work for me!  I made it all the way through adding the water fine, but after adding 4 Tablespoons the dough was like soup!  I guess I should have been paying more attention to the dough and not to the recipe.

This crust was really easy to make and highly workable, but not all that flaky and rather dense.  It's functional but not going to impress anyone.

The only pie crust recipe I've ever tried, and there's no need to look elsewhere! I used it to make mini pie cups and filled it with cannoli cream. I'll come back to this recipe again and again! I cut the butter into small chunks and then put it in the food processor with most of the flour. Then I took it out of the food processor and combined all the ingredients in a bowl and smushed it all together with my hands. Worked great!

This pie crust is so easy and the best crust I've tasted when it's hot out of the oven. It gets a little moist the longer the pie sits, so you have to eat it within a day to get the best consistency out of it. I will continue to use and recommend this!

This was my first attempt at making my own pie crust. The taste was wonderful, but I only gave 4 stars bc I had a few issues with the dough. I made 5 of these back to back for all of my Thanksgiving pies. I followed everything exactly and the dough was very crumbly and difficult to work with. I really think it just needs a little more ice water to make it easier to work with, but as I said this was my first pie crust so maybe I am the one who doesn't know. I will be trying this again but adding a little more water to make it easier to roll out.

Insanely incredible. It's like a flakey euro pastry crust. Followed the recipe but added a touch of sugar to it. I think the important part is throwing the butter in the freezer for a few hours & then dicing it into tiny bits. Worked the dough minimally, balled it, wrapped it in plastic & threw it back in the 'fridge for about 90 mins. The yolk-brushed finish is perfect & I sprinkled a bit of sugar on it. I didn't think I could be surprised in the kitchen anymore. WOW! This is a crazy good Thanksgiving present. THANKS!

The key to this pie crust (all pie crusts really!) is keeping every ingredient super duper cold.  I put them all in the freezer for about 1/2 hour prior to using them, and then toss them all into my food processor. Super yummy every time & super texture!

Awesome crust!  I placed my dough between two pieces of wax paper and rolled it out to the desired size.  As long as all ingredients are SUPER cold this method works great.  Kept it between the wax paper in the frig and peeled it back after about 30-40 min.  Went right in the pie plate.  Very Tasty!

The only downside to this recipe is that my family has made me promise to always use it and never to buy prepared pie crusts... adds a lot of prep time to my apple pies!

Fabulous. My mother won't stop raving about the chicken pot pie I made with this crust. She even wants me to give her the recipe of the crust for her peach cobbler. Which by the way has been a family favorite since the 1920's and hasn't been changed, until recently.

This is a very tasty crust, but honestly--1 cup of flour would have made enough crust, I think.  I rolled as normal, and it was rather thick and I still had excess.  To give a bit better strength and richness for my apple pie, I used milk instead of water, worked great!

I have never baked a pie nor made pie crusts, but this recipe gave me a lot of confidence in baking pies as it is very easy to follow.  I doubled the recipe to make double crusts fruit pie (blackberry and white peaches).  Surprisingly, even for a beginner, this recipe worked wonders!  My husband thought that the crusts were exceptional!  This is absolutely staying in my collection!

This is my first time making a pie crust.  My first attempt was a failure.  Then I become more flexible with the recipe.  I don't have a pastry cutter, so I used a folk, and apparently if you are quick, you can also use your fingers.  And I started with 1 1/3 cups of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt since I saw some other reviewers used more salt as well.  And because I am slow, and it's important to keep the dough cold, I placed the dough on a bucket of ice when I worked on it.  And whenever I felt needed, I will place the dough inside the freezer for a while.  In terms of water, on my first attempt, I used the full amount of water but the dough cracked.  So what I did second time around was that I still added water a tablespoon at a time, then used a folk to toss the mixture around, and if I saw there was still dry ingredients left, I added a little bit more water, until everything clumped together then I started kneading.  And if the dough is too wet, I could always add more flour!

Best pie crust ever, hands down. I used this for my first pie, and it was so easy (even though everyone always tells me to buy the crust because it's "too hard"). This isn't hard. The only thing I do differently is add a couple more tablespoons water. I wrap it up, put it in the freezer for ten minutes, and it rolls out perfectly. Yay butter pie crust!

This pie crust worked pretty good. It tasted way better than the store bought type, but would prefer it just a little flakier.  I didn't realize how bland the store bought crusts were, as I have used them for quite some time. I used about 3 Tblsp of ice water and refridgerated it for about 2 hours.  I rolled the dough out between two pieces of plastic wrap and it worked great.  I pierced the shell once in the pie pan and then baked it for approximately 15 min. at 450 deg. If making a double layer, lattice, or deep dish you will need more than 1X the recipe though. Will probably use again until I find one that taste as a good with a little more flakiness.

This tasted great and worked wonderful in the apple pie I made with it (All American Apple Pie from this site.)    I didn't let mine refrigerate the whole four hours because I didn't realize until I had two hours before dinner that it needed to be done.  No worries, it turned out perfect nonetheless.  I rolled out the dough in the pie pan I was using and just refrigerated it about one hour in the pan, then put all the filling in and baked it 45 minutes, covering it with foil for the last 10 so the crust wouldn't burn.  I'll be trying this out for my chocolate silk pie and any other pies I make.  I won't bother buying them when it's so easy to make.  Thank you for posting this!

This is the very first "american pie" crust I ever tried making, and it came outright perfect. What else is a better recommendation? :)  Dana, now when I have no need to look for other recipe all I can say is a great thanks!

I love this recipe! Simple and tasty!  This has such a wonderful light taste. Unlike traditional pie crust that calls for Crisco which I'm not a big fan because of the funny after taste. I'll never make pie crust the old way again :) I also use this crust in my pot pie recipe!

I hate making pie crusts but this is the BEST, most delicious and easy recipe I've ever used. I highly recommend it ! I freeze the butter beforehand and grate it in and stick all the dry ingredients into a metal container [ like a rice cooker pot lol ] to help keep everything as cold as possible. Definitely a heart attack recipe but sooo good that you can't pass it up ! Thanks !

I used this for chicken pot pie, following the recipe exactly, and it came out wonderfully!  I'd highly recommend this since it's easy to work with the dough, and I love that it doesn't require shortening or lard.  I didn't need to chill this, and even though it says the original recipe yield is 1 single pie crust, I was able to divide the dough in half and make a double pie crust.  Would love to try this crust with apple pie since it has a good taste and texture.

Really good!  I always used shortening in my pie crust but in the past 2 years I have been trying to take a more natural approach to my cooking whenever I can.  A butter based pie crust has been one of the last things I have become a "convert" to, though.  I honestly thought it couldn't be done, but this recipe proved me wrong and has now become my go to pie crust!

I've made other pie crusts before using shortening. Like others I am trying to stay away from it.  This recipe produced the absolute best crust I have ever had!  I used unsalted butter and bread flour.  I kept the flour in the freezer and chilled my hands before working the dough.  Perfectly flaky.  This one went right into my recipe box for future use in pies, pastries, etc.  Thank you!!

This was ok.  It was usable, but the top layer of my pie came out kind of tough, not flaky like the recipe suggests.  The flavour was just mediocre, nothing special.

This is above and beyond the BEST pie crust I have EVER made. My mom scoffed at me when I said I wanted to use real butter to make a pie crust, she said it couldn't be done, lol. She thought shortening was the only way to go...until she took a bite of my pie!! It was easier to do and it rolled out SO easily! Thanks for the great recipe and I followed it to the T! No alterations needed, which is a rarity on this site. You NEED to try this pie crust!

EXCELLENT!  Went together so easily.  We only refridgerated the dough for a few minutes.  It worked out just fine.  My husband rolled out the dough and kept saying how nice it was to work with.  More importantly though, it tasted wonderful.  We used it for homemade chicken pot pies!!  Yummy!!

This is my go-to pie crust recipe. I use it for pot pies, quiches and dessert pies. I usually add 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and then 3/4 c. white flour. I always combine the ingredients in a food processor and add the ICE water slowly until it forms a clump. Add a few more drops of water if using the wheat flour. Thanks for the fab piecrust recipe!

Worked GREAT!  Froze the butter as another reviewer suggested, used a handy chopper to cut in the butter, and was able to roll out and use immediately without further chilling.  SO YUMMY!

I doubled the recipe to make a bottom and top crust for my apple pie, and the only change I made was to leave out the salt. I will never ever use another pie crust recipe because this one turned out flaky and delicious. The trick is to use cold butter when cutting into the dough and to use water with actual ice in it to keep it cold. And most of all do not overwork the dough! It should still have little traces of butter chunks in it.

This was my first pie crust I have made in a long while. I was a little nervous because after a night of chilling it, the dough looked as though I didn't mix it up well when forming it into a ball. When I rolled it out, it was breaking apart quite a bit. Once I worked it a little with my hands, it placed in the pie dish quite nicely. End result... buttery, flaky and delicious! Delicious crust with only 4 ingredients and easy to make. Highly recommend.

Wonderful flavor! And pretty easy to do, too. I was careful not to over mix, and I chilled the crust well before baking. I learned from a friend that the way the French make their pie crusts flaky is they make sure their butter never gets to room temperature--even when being mixed. Chill, chill, chill! I'll definitely use this recipe again. So much better than shortening crusts!

This is the flakiest crust I've ever made!! I've used 5 different recipes, tweaked them, etc... trying to get them right. And this was so simple and easy and it is SOO good. I made an apple pie, and I worried it would get soggy by the next day. Day 2 - still incredibly flaky. LOVE IT!! Thanks Dana  Two other comments: (1) I did have a little trouble rolling it out without it breaking, but I'll use the advice of another reviewer for my next batch. (2) To make two crusts, I made two separate batches. I've noticed the amount of flour changes on some recipe when doubling, and I didn't want to take a chance in getting it wrong.

This crust is AMAZING. I used it for my pumpkin pie this season and it was actually delicious on its own. I added a little cinnamon and ginger to it, because those were the main pie flavours and it worked out really well.

Really awesome and so simple.  I used it for a chicken pot pie and it came out flaky, buttery and perfectly golden.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Amazing Pie Crust!  I took the advice from another reviewer.  KEEP EVERYTHING COLD!  And I blended the butter, salt and flour in a food processor until coarse crumbles.  Then put in a bowl and added 2 TBSP water, one at a time, mushing with fork in-between.  DO NOT OVER MIX!  Made a ball and wrapped in plastic wrap.  Put in fridge for approx 1 hour.  Then its ready to roll out!  It turned out so flaky!  De-LISH!  Will definitely use again!

Great recipe! Makes one crust, so double if you're making a two crust pie.     Be sure to follow the instruction to chill the butter and the water.  Chilling is crucial for a flaky end result, and you can make this pie even better if you also chill the flour, your mixing bowl, the appliance you use to cut the butter into the flour, the room you work in, etc.      I suggest that you invest in the highest quality butter you can find.  Butter is the primary taste in the crust, and a high quality butter's taste really shines through.  You may pay twice as much, but that's only about an extra $3, and that breaks down to $0.37 per slice.  I'm all about saving money, but this is absolutely a worthwhile investment.    If you want an even flakier crust, or if money is tight, substitute some shortening for butter, using equal portions.  Shortening flakes a lot more but isn't nearly as rich and flavorful as butter.       My final note is that you should work the dough as little as possible. The more you roll and reuse dough, the less flaky and tender the end result will be.

Not easy, but went over well! I made it twice. Rolling out the dough the first time caused great problems as it "melted" and didn't have the flakiness anymore. The second time, I quickly worked the pie crust as best I could.

I doubled this recipe to make the Peach Pie the Old Fashioned Two Crust Way from  this site. Wow! I had perfect results. I used my food processor to mix the butter, salt and flour. I only put the dough in the fridge for 20 min - any more and I was afraid I might not have been able to roll it out. This was so easy. Thanks!

Tasty crust, but wow, is it ever hard to work with!  Definitely roll it out twice, as one reviewer suggested.  That helps tremendously.

Awesome! I didn't have the time to let it sit in the fridge for 4 hours and only did about 45 minutes, but it still turned out wonderful.

UPDATE: I made this crust again twice over thanksgiving and it turned out terrible both times.  We had to throw away our cherry pie cause the crust was so bad. :( It was very disappointing. Don't know what I did differently from the first time but I can't recreate the delicious crust from before.

Very good- I did this with whole wheat flour and while the crust came out very thick, it also tasted wholesome and healthier. I also substituted half of the butter with brummel and brown (yogurt substitute, chilled). I will use this crust again.

I made this for apple pie. And even though I totally cheated (I used my hands to mix the butter in and I only refrigerated it for 1 hour) it was great! It was probably not as flaky because of my cheats, but it still tasted fabulous.

Thank you a thousand times over for this fabulous recipe!  This was my first attempt ever to make a pie crust.  I was very careful not to overwork the dough and to keep the butter and the water ice cold.  I was pretty paranoid during the whole process, but it turned out super flakey and light!  Had this not turned out, it could have turned me off of ever trying to make pie crust again, but thank goodness it came through for me and just might have opened up a whole new can of worms--now, I'm thinking of sugar cream pie, raspberry pie, apple...  Thank you, Dana!

I've made this crust twice. The first time as written, and the second time following ChibiChef's suggestions. 4 stars as is, 5 with the suggestions. It comes out flaky indeed, but it much easier to work with when the butter/drys are pullsed in the food processor and the water is tossed in with a fork. I rolled it out between 2 sheets of parchment without any issues. Used this on a mocha wanut pie. Delicious.

Omg!!! this crust is amazing!! I'd added the recipe to my recipe box a long time ago and yesterday gave it a try. It's the flakiest crust ever. Followed the recipe to a T, but I was in a rush and decided to put the dough in the freezer until it was firm. Got amazing results! obviously this one goes now with my favorites! THANK YOU!!!

The dough was very easy to work with although I did need a bit more water.  I only chilled it for 10 min. and the crust did lose its nice crimped shape but didn't shrink much.  It was very flaky and had a nice crunch to it.  I made mine for pumpkin pie but I think this crust would be best with fruit pies.  Overall very tasty, I do use salted butter plus most of the salt called for.

Shortening is creepy factory-lard. And lard is, well, lard. So what baking fat are you left with? Butter. Thank goodness it makes such a fantastic crust.

This pie crust was great for a chicken pot pie. It only makes enough for the top of the pie, so I would double it next time to have a crust and topping on my pot pie. I didn't have time to chill the dough for a long time so I put it in the freezer for 30 minutes and then rolled it out. It worked great!

I followed the directions exactly and this crust turned out so flaky, tasty, and beautiful that my family is still talking about this crust three months later! I'm making it again for Thanksgiving. I leave the crust in the fridge for as long as possible before rolling it because that's really where the magic comes from (as far as I'm concerned)...

This crust was everything a great crust should be.  It was flaky and tasty and easy to make!  I did as another reviewer suggested and put the butter in the freezer first and it worked great.  I followed the recipe exactly and everything worked out perfect.  I will never use another crust recipe.  I've finally found one that works and I will stick to using this one.

I doubled this recipe and successfully made two pumpkin pies with it. I used organic unbleached spelt flour, and it worked well.
It can be difficult to make a good pie crust, but one thing I've found helpful is the use of a pie crust maker, which can be found on amazon, or in specialty cookware stores. They're cheap, they prevent flour from getting everywhere, and they ensure that your crust is the perfect size and shape!
I love that this recipe uses butter, as I prefer to bake with something natural rather than with hydrogenated oil (shorterning). And the results were too delicious to make me change my mind!

Today was my first attempt at making a home made pie crust. I don't typically buy shortening so I was looking for an alternative method when I found this recipe. I followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Crust is buttery and flaky; just perfect for home made apple pie. I can also envision this being a great crust for a savory dish as well. This one is a keeper! Thanks so much for sharing.

Salty!  Maybe I should have used unsalted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe.  
Good crust, but not that suitable for my apple pie.  I think it would be great for a meat pot pie.

Yum. I made a double recipe of this to go with the Baked Fresh Cherry Pie, and it was really tasty. I find that it's best to sort of knead the dough into a ball when I take it out of the refrigerator - this softens it up a little bit and also makes it easier to roll into a circle. I think I'll try this recipe with pot pies this weekend!

This crust was fabulous and SOOO easy!  It is my first real pie crust... in the past, I've just worked with pre-made crusts.  I was nervous about it coming out correctly, but if you just make sure to keep everything cold and don't handle it too much, everything will be just fine!  Easy as "pie"!  Oh, and it holds its shape very well if you are using cookie cutter shapes for your top crust :)

Instead of putting in the fridge for 4 hrs I rolled it out between 2 sheets of saran wrap (didn't have wax paper at the time) and that also made it easy to transfer to the pie dish.Turned out nice & flaky and had a great buttery flavor.  It would've been more tender I suppose but I had to add a couple more Tbsp of water as others have said because the ball wasn't coming together too easily.

I've only made crust once before. This turned out fabulous. I made the water VERY cold, and the butter VERY cold, by putting both in the freezer (not too long for the butter though). I didn't use any power mixers/tools. I just used a fork to mash the pieces of butter against the side the bowl with the flour. I did that for a while. Then added the icey water slowly. I definitely did not over-knead this. Turned out perfect!

I agree with some previous reviewers that this recipe was hard to work with, but it's really worth the effort.  Usually I'm a firm believer in lard crusts (and my grandmother would roll over in her grave if she could read this review), but I plan to use this recipe in the future.  It's flaky and has wonderful flavor.  If you've got some experience with pie crusts and want a challenging, but fabulous recipe use this one.

Really good and very easy. I recommend using a food processor to cut the butter in. I had a hard time using cutting it in by hand. They turned out flaky and tasty

Awesome!  This crust was the start of my pie (filled it with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe) and everyone LOVED it.  We had it at Thanksgiving dinner and it was soooo good.  The crust was the star and was the most talked about part of our deserts.  I will keep this recipe and it will be my permanent recipe for pie crust.  No need to look any farther.

this is so good, but i freaked out when i took it out of the fridge, the dough was hard so i used the knife to cut it in pieces till it becomes soft, i used cookie sheet to roll out the dough. the water was too much for it so i put only half of it, using this technique i read it in this site, adding 1 tbs at a time, that worked well with me. for the filling i made Apple Pie by Grandma Ople from this site. try it with vanila ice cream on the side ;)

This crust tasted really good, but it was a bit tough. That may be totally my fault though. Also, next time I will roll out the dough BEFORE putting it in the fridge because this chilled dough is harder to work with than dough made with shortening BY FAR. I paired this crust with the Grandma Ople's Apple Pie form this site that has over 1500 reviews and it was DELICIOUS. I will not used trasfat-laden shortening ever again.

I loved this crust.I made it with the Tomato-basil quiche recipe listed on this site as well and loved it. My only problem was that I needed to bake it longer than the 8(initial) minutes listed on the corresponding recipe.I will definitely be making this one again!

This was the first homemade crust I have ever tried and it came out great. I made a double batch and used it on the bottom and top of the blackberry and chocolate chip pie from this site. The only thing I had trouble w/ the directions was after wrapping and refridgerating the balls of dough, they were too stiff and did not roll out and I had to defrost them in the microwave a bit, then added some flour to my rolling pin...they came out great. I also used an egg white wash on the top of this crust...so good...thanks for the recipe!

I made my first pie crust ever for tonights dinner and it turned out great! It was flaky and very delicious I wanted to eat the crust all by itself! The bottom of my dish was a little soggy but that was no problem for us. :) I used margarine (no salt of milk added to it) instead of butter because that's all I had. I also put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes. I was in a hurry to make dinner. ;-) I'm just glad I was able to use butter/margarine because where I live it is hard to find shortening! Thanks!

Super easy to make, very flaky and easy to roll out.  I kept the dough in the fridge just a couple of hours and had no problem at all rolling it out.  It was the perfect size too.

I also probably overmixed (I used my food processor), but it still turned out delicious.  I didn't chill it either, and it rolled out fine as long as I used flour underneath the dough and on the rolling pin.  I used it for Chicken Pot Pie IV, so I doubled the recipe.  Super easy!

I love this recipe! So simple yet so good. It was one of the first times I ever made a pie crust from scratch and it turned out great. Flaky and yummy. I followed the how to make a pie crust step-by-step guide together with this recipe and even though it looked a bit too butter-ish first, I let it rest for 4 hours in the fridge and when I got it out it was Heaven. Really use to work with, I didn't have to do much! I tried to handle it as little as possible!

This crust does taste like shortbread, it is sooo good that i could eat it without any filling!  I followed the directions exactly as stated but I made butter tarts, this recipe made about 10 tarts.  I think I may have worked with the dough a little too much somewhere along the line because the crust was a little firm which was actually okay for the tarts, but this was a very good crust recipe.  I'm already thinking pumpkin pie with whipped cream for the Canadian Thanksgiving.....mmmm :)

Absolutely awesome and very easy to make. I used my standing mixer and added water a tablespoon at a time. I also used Plugra butter, which has alower water content. I let it chill for about 6 hours, and the resulting crust was so flaky and buttery. This was my first time making a pie crust, and I used it for a chicken pot pie.

This is exactly what I've been looking for! I think I may have over worked the dough a little but it still turned out okay and the taste was superb.  How can you go wrong with butter??!!? Will definately use again.

What a perfect pie crust! I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was perfect. I made the Blueberry Crumb Pie recipe found on this site...which I highly recommend that you try...especially with this crust!!! Thank you so much for this recipe! Oh....and one comment to Affinity...many crust recipes are similar to one another...makes me wonder why you're in such a tizzy...hmmmm.

I made this crust to top a pot pie, and it couldn't have been better!  I did have to add an extra Tbsp. water, and only chilled for 1 hour, but it still came out great!

3 stars because this is my first crust. I think the reason why the crust came out so badly was because of my newbie-like skills. But when I did follow the recipie to the tip, however I do think there was too much water needed. When I poured everything in my auto-mixer it became gooey and I ended up using A LOT of flour, more than the recipe specified (I was told to do so by a real chef). Might want to alter the water needed, that's really all.

Awesome flavour. I could eat this plain if I wanted to.  However, (unless I'm entertaining for guests) if I'm just baking for my family, I don't want them to have the 22g of fat per slice in all the pies I make.

I've made apple & blueberry pies with this crust and my husband and I thought they were fabulous! I usually don't even eat pie because I don't like the nasty trans fat shortening crust, but this made the pie!

This worked great!  Couple of little secrets though...had to add a pinch more of water to help consitancy and only chilled for 2 hours.  came out VERY flaky and perfect for our chicken pot pie.  Oh yes...I also doubled the recipe to make a top and bottom crust.  Excellent!!!

Great recipe! I double the amount and used a 9 in springform pan for chicken pot pie.  Came out awsome.  I chilled it for one hour only as well since it was much easier to manuver the dough.  No need to buy box pie crust anymore! Thanks =)

I had high hopes for this crust, based on the reviews, but it was disappointing. It could be me, though. I added 1 tablespoon of sugar and used the food processor to cut in the butter. The dough formed well, rolled out nicely and went into the pie plate fairly easily. I made lemon meringue pie so I baked the crust first. It shrank terribly,didn't hold the shape of the crimped edge at all and was tough and chewy. Perhaps I overmixed but I thought I was being careful. I may try again but I've seriously considered giving up on homemade crust.

Wow!!  After trying many pie-crust recipes, I've finally found the perfect one!  Thank you so much for submitting your recipe, Dana. :)  I followed the recipe exactly, except I chilled my dough for only 1 hr. (The crust came out perfect anyway!)  And hardly any mess.  Super easy to work with, little mess, and no sticking.  My pecan pie has never tasted so good!  Very buttery and flaky crust.

I found using l/4 cup butter Crisco shortening and l/4 lard makes a pretty good crust. It's not as rich as plain butter and it seems the dough is easier to handle and bakes a more even crust.

this pie crust is truly buttery and flaky. my only problem is that i live in tropical thailand..which means that i have to put the dough back into the fridge several times while rolling it out because the butter melts so fast! i guess i also didn't cut the butter that well, as i could see streaks of butter in the dough. but i tried baking a small piece of the crust and it turned out tasting great. =) i'm using this pie crust for a chinese style custard tart, and i think it will turn out great.

For my first attempt at pie crusts from scratch, this recipe was incredibly easy. However, my finished pie was a little chewy. Don't know if it was just me and my first try, but I will use this recipe again. My husband loved it, though. He keeps hinting for more apple pies. I guess that's all that matters! Thanks!

This recipe is excellent!  I have never before attempted a pie crust from scratch... but I had no problems with this on the first try!  (Oh... and I cheated a little... I only chilled for 2 hours... but it came out fine!)

The really nice thing about this crust is that it can work for sweet pies like the apple I'm about to dig into as well as entre dishes like pot pies.

A+++ recipe!

This recipe was fabulous.  I never make my own crust, but I definetly will from now on.  This crust is very flaky.  It was a hit for my Pecan Pie.  It was a little hard to work with because it was a little sticky, but it is worth it.

The first time I made this I accidentally used a whole cup of butter instead of half, and it was so good that I use that amount every single time. Shared with friends and they all said that it was the best crust they’ve ever tasted. I also grated frozen butter which worked really well to get that crumbly texture before making it into a ball and putting it in the fridge. Perfectly buttery and flaky. I will never use a different recipe.

The keyword to this pie crust is "cold".  When mixing the ingredients together, the dough was moist but not sticky when using the cold butter and water.  I recommend this!

This is an easy and tasty crust! I usually have to add about 1/2 c water but still get amazing results. Try using this recipe with the corn syrup-free Pecan Pie recipe! Can you say Butter Pecan! Yum!

Love this recipe! Simple,  quick, and foolproof. I used it to make mini quiches and this made 10, though it could probably be stretched a little further to make 12.

I had problems getting the dough to form a small course ball. The dough was much finer. I thinks that’s why it wasn’t flaky.

This crust is perfect for apple pie and I think it would also be tasty for pot pie. I followed the recipe proper and made sure to keep everything cold. I made it three times for apple pie on three occasions and it got rave reviews.

This has been my go-to for years and comes out perfectly every time. I use a cheese grater for the butter and when I'm not using it, I keep it in the freezer until the exact second I need it. It's also important to let the pie crust rest in the refrigerator to keep cold.

Best crust ever! This was an easy crust to put together and tasted great. Big tip that helped me was reading another review that said to use frozen butter and grate it. Easily incorporates into the dough and you wont have to over work. I used a pastry cutter and a cold bowl.

Turned out flakey, but it's not meant to be a dessert pie crust. It was thick, buttery, and flakey and would have been perfect for a chicken pot pie. I definitely wouldnt make it again for a dessert type of pie. Overall it was just ok.

OMG!! This is the best crust!! The buttery flavor really comes out. It was so nice and flaky. Unfortunately, I cannot roll out an even crust to save my life! I've tried in the past to make a crust. I'd give up and just buy the store bought one. Then maybe years later I'd try again. I just can't roll it out round! I made the apple pie sticks. I figured it was safe. Lol then I thought I'd go for a rectangle. Couldn't even do that!! I made due though. The flaky  layers look so good too!!! I took advice from others....work quickly...keep it cold...that includes rolling pin and cutting board. Thank you. Now to work on my technique!

Used this recipe for Thanksgiving pies and I was very disappointed.  The flavor was bland.  The butter turned everything greasy so be sure to bake your pie on a cookie sheet or your house will be a smoky mess.   The crust was tough and not flaky.  We could barely cut the pies.

Easy to make in the food processor. I didn’t refrigerate as time was of the essence. First crust I prevailed for 7 minutes so the crust wouldn’t be soggy (as one person recommended). Turned out great - you’ll want to protect the edges so they don’t get too dark (I used foil.)

I'ts been 10 years since I made a pie crust from scratch. I always remember them being so hard... trying not to crack it... fretting over it. Well I let my 5 year old make this recipe and it turned out perfect!

So good! I let the dough rest over night before rolling it out and it came together so easily. I found I needed more water than the recipe calls for, but it was beautifully flaky and very easy to roll out.

I followed the suggestion in one of the reviews to freeze butter, then grate it and then freeze again. The most perfect pie crust i have ever made!

I made it exactly as it said. I just made more of it. I also rolled it out on parchment paper to make it easier to transfer. I have tried for years to make pie crust and this was easier than I thought!

It was such a simple and easy tasty recipe for pie crust. I made it for a strawberry blueberry pie and it was so good. Most pie crusts are too dry for my liking.

I made individual chicken pot pies and used this recipe as the crust. It was great. I could only let it refrigerate for a couple of hours, but I don't think it mattered. It was very light, flaky, and easy to work with. I used my food processor to blend ingredients and it only took a few seconds.

This recipe is fantastic and super easy. I substituted in gluten free flour  and it was a delicious. The only  difference was that I had to use a little more water.

Best pie crust EVER.  Simple easy recipe.  I doubled the recipe and made a beautiful double crust cherry pie from scratch.  Reminded me of baking with my grandma in the 1950's.  Thanks for the recipe and the memories.  :)

Wow, I love the enthusiasm of these bakers, it is even better than the recipe! Clearly, these are serious bakers and although I remember the days of shortening and Crisco, I never handled it much. I've not had much luck at baking, being a cook for a long time. 

Here, I used a food processor bec it's super fast. Followed all recommendations for chilling all the ingredients and implements. Added a wee bit of sugar bec/ it would naturally be Grandma Ople's Apple Pie. It really is a good crust, no fuss, fast, simple. 

I do use a 9.5" glass baking dish bec/ it's beautiful and I'm always running out of crust, so did some math to enlarge the recipe for the bottom crust a bit. 

Thank you so much for this excellent recipe. The boyfriend loves making apple pies with me using this exact recipe, and my godson said it was the best crust he's ever had ... in front of his mother!! I'm also super happy for all those lovely bakers who posted amazing photos of their creations. Bring it! Cheers!!

I have often had difficulty with making pie crusts in the past but this recipe was a hit! I'll certainly be using this recipe again.

I made it at the last minute and couldn't chill it for 4 hours so I just pressed it into the pie plate with my hands to form a crust and it worked perfect!

I put our pizza stone in the freezer overnight and rolled out the pastry dough on it the next morning. Did a great job keeping the butter from melting while I was rolling it out!

Easy to make and so much better than store bought. Followed directions exactly. Make sure to let the dough rest so that it does not shrink when baking.

I wanted an easy "bread" to make little pastries with. Even though this is a pie crust recipe, it actually turned out really well. I mixed together cream cheese, honey, powdered sugar, and a little honey for some yummy goodness. I rolled and cut little squares out of the dough and put the concoction together. When they were done baking, I topped them with chocolate syrup. I was very pleased with the result! I will be trying this recipe the next time I make a pie.

I would highly suggest to add a tablespoon of sugar a teaspoon of baking soda instead of water is milk with ice and a teaspoon of vanilla that directions did not include baking at what temp and for how long so I did 350 and kept an ion it I made this crust not for a pie but for strawberries to pour over at an old southern recipe turned out Amazing also if you put a small amount of rice in the middle at the time of baking it will keep the crust from becoming less flaky good luck

As others have noted, did not overwork the dough.  Blended in cold butter cut into 1/4" cubes, added a little ice water until I could just make a ball that held together, and wrapped that in plastic wrap.  Chilled dough for less than an hour, about half of that in freezer.  Rolled out a top quickly using a pie crust bag.  Fresh egg yolk.  Result was light, flavorful and delicious!

Great crust! Easy to make. None of the extra junk of a store bought crust. Flaky and hold ups well with the Turkey Pot Pie I recipe from this site. You can totally use two forks to cut the butter into the flour, but getting an inexpensive pastry blender makes it easier. You can pick one up at Walmart for around $2.00.

Good and simple.  I  grated frozen butter and then froze it again,  and used a processor so as not to overwork the dough...and kept everything cold, cold, cold...that is the  secret for flaky pie crust.  Will use this recipe again.

Excellent recipe, very easy to follow, makes a perfect pie crust and works extremely well with White Whole Wheat flour (King Arthur).  It scales up well as I generally use this for 3 or 4 pie crusts.

I grew up with a family that always used hot water pie crust and always hated crust...soggy, disgusting. But, I’ve had some very nice crusts others made so....thought I’d give this a go.
I loved it. Tender, flakey and no sog!

I used the food processor with room temp flour, cold butter cut in chunks and salted as well as salt.  Added chilled water by the Tbs and did not use all of it before the dough became a ball. Immediately stopped, worked in any sticky bits from the water by hand, rolled it right out in parchment and popped it into the freezer where I left it about a half an hour. Came out perfect!  This is my new pie crust recipe! Don’t overwork it!

The best pie crust recipe out there, hands down. Don't sub anything and follow directions . This makes one 9" crust. I tried to double the recipe and it didn't turn out right so I always only make one at a time. Believe me it's worth the work.

I made this crust three times.  The first time was sort of flaky.  The second time was a tough crust.  The third time was in between.
I followed the extra tips about keeping everything very cold, not over handling the dough and not adding too much water.  I only use butter made from grass fed cows and don't know if that makes a difference.
I have always received compliments about the pie crust that I make.  So I know how to make crust, but this recipe is simply too undependable, especially to worry about  ever making it for guests.
Actually, I'm done with it.

I knew absolutely nothing about making pie crust. I thought it was so hard. I gave it a try and my husband loves just about any pie I make as long as it's with this crust.

I made this recipe and wondering why it was crunchy. Made it to top a chicken pot pie and brushed the top with melted butter.

Very easy and perfectly flaky.  Highly recommend! First try was for a quiche; second will be for a pie.

Great crust; made a couple of small changes though.  First, I kept the butter pieces rather large to get more flake.  Second, I added a T of white sugar (was making a pie so the sweetness was perfectly acceptable).  Really helped with the browning.  I am making this one again.

Delicious, This was my first official pie crust. So Good! I used this recipe and tweaked it after reading a one of the reviews. Using unsalted butter and Ice Ice cold water helped significantly. Added to favorites. Even passed my Mother in Laws approval. I'll call that a WIN!

Crust was easy. Tasted great. My only complaint was that I doubled it thinking I would get enough crust for two pies...not even close...and I rolled it very thin (too thin).

PERFECT crust!!!  I doubled it to make a double pie crust, used icy water (measured it in a glass and then put in the freezer until it got ice chips) and made sure to keep the butter chilled and hard.  This came out perfectly and I was so proud!  I also brushed the crust with some egg white and water to give it a more goldeny color when it baked.

This is the best tasting pie crust.   I used to make pie crusts with shortening.  What a fool I was.   Never again!  I use this for pumpkin pie, apple pie and pot pies.   I use my food processor to mix it.

I doubled this recipe to make a large deep dish pie. I put salt and flour in bowl, grated cold butter into it and then worked it lightly, pinching with my fingers. Then I added the ice water and mixed again with my hands just until dry bits of flour were gone- literally no more than one minute. I didn’t even rest it in the fridge! I made a pot pie and brushed the top with egg and it was THE best pie crust I have ever eaten!

The only thing I did was set the dough in the refrigerator until I was ready to use it. It was so easy to roll out and totally delicious. I used it on the top of a turkey pot pie. Look good also. I forgot to take a picture.

If you are making a double crust pie the shell must be baked first. This recipe makes a double crust. For the lower crust, you roll half the dough out, put it in pie plate, mold edges to top of pie plate, cut excess edges to fit,  pierce crust  all over with fork, then put aluminum pie pan (or tin foil) on lower crust to allow you to weigh it down with beans (or something heavy),  and bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Then put pie filling inside, top with 2nd level pie crust, dust top crust with a couple tablespoons of sugar (optional but I like it),  cut holes in top of crust so heat can escape, bake for 30 minutes or whatever your recipe recommends.  then you'll have a terrific pie!!! I love to bake!!! Don't you?

I made this crust recipe and doubled it for a two crust pie. I mixed it up with recommended amounts of ice water but it wouldn’t form a ball. Just a pile of flour. I added almost a 1/4 cup extra water and it formed a nice crumbly ball of dough. I thought it was just perfect with the extra butter. Pie crust is best with butter and this one is good. I will use again for sure.

This turned out perfect! I always prefer to make pie crust without shortening and this recipe was the BEST butter-only recipe I’ve tried. I made a double batch because I was making a pie I had to cut/shape. I put each disc in the fridge in between rolling them out and working with them in rotation to keep them as cold as possible. They turned out super flaky!

Made this crust because I didn’t have store bought (I know, I know).  It was amazing!  Now, my boyfriend said he will not eat store bought crusts again.  Homemade, from this recipe, from now on!

I love the flakey-butteriness of this pie crust.  It will be my go-to recipe from now on.

This is a really good recipe that I have made 4 or 5 times now. The tips from chibi chef really helped alot. I put the water in the freezer until it forms ice crystals on the outside. I also put my flour and butter in the freezer for a little while so that all ingredients are really cold. A tip that I would add to the list is to use a fine cheese grater to grate your butter. This revolutionized the whole thing. Especially if you don't have a food processor. The first time I made this recipe, it took a lot of time and effort to work the butter into the flour and one of the tricks is to not work the crust too much. Grating the butter into fine shreds lets you fork it easily into the flour/salt and quickly becomes the consistency of canned parmesian and can start adding water. I also have a large plastic cutting board  (approx 2ft ×3ft) that I put into the freezer before hand so that I have a cool surface to roll the crust out on. I cover it in a thin layer of the cold flour from the freezer and roll my crust. Some one else came up with putting a gallon ziplock full of ice on the roll out surface if you don't have a large cutting board. I hope these tips help.

There is definitely a knack to this. Third time is a charm and I had a great crust! I needed a bit more water. Also I chilled everything in the freezer for about 5 minutes. I also chilled the granite before I rolled the dough.

An all-butter crust rolls out so well! I used unsalted butter and doubled the salt, as well as adding an equal amount of sugar (1/2 tsp. per one-crust recipe.) I use my food processor to mix dry ingredients, cut in the butter with a few pulses, and create the dough while pouring in a stream of ice water. So easy!

This is my go to pie crust! Every time I make it, it comes out with beautiful layers and a great flavor, but it did take me a few tries to master it. I find that I always need a little more water than the recipe suggests, but it really depends. I freeze my butter beforehand and it works super well. Since I don't have a food processor at home, I cut the frozen butter into small cubes and work it in by hand. I even tried using a cheese grater to shred the butter, which worked fine. This is a super simple recipe and is very reliable!

I actually did not have time to refrigerate this pie crust for 4 hours before putting together and baking my pie and it still turned out perfect.  I doubled the recipe and used half to make a lattice top and it looked beautiful.  Thank you!

This was excellent! I usually use all shortening, but this had such great reviews that I did half shortening and half butter - mainly to use up the last of my shortening. So delicious! My husband even commented on how good the crust was.

One important step left out of the recipe is to let the ball of dough come to room temperature before trying to roll it out. It is hard as a rock coming out of the fridge. I also think I left it in the fridge too long. Next time I will just do 4 hrs.  It was kind of gooey when I rolled it out. 
This recipe won't easily do a deep dish pie.  You can get it very thin to fit, but is a lot of rolling.

I have made this multiple times now and it has always worked great for me. It is now my go to pie crust recipe. I once  used it to make biscuts just to see how it would do and my family loved them for thier buttery softness. Its a keeper and I made no changes to the recipe.

I came across this recipe when I was looking for a crust to make for chicken pot pie. The recipe for chicken pot pie called for two store-bought and pre-made pie crusts, however I didn't have the heart to use those for a homemade chicken pot pie. This pie crust recipe made a night and day difference in the chicken pot pie recipe and now I will only be using this recipe for a classic pie crust. The chicken pot pie went absolutely wonderfully with this pie crust and now I never made chicken pot pie without making this crust for it

This is the first time I have made pie crust, and now I can not go back to store-bought dough. It was flaky and buttery just like the name says. I suggest covering the sides with tin foil if you see that the crust is done, but the pie filling is not; this way, it will not burn.

The best crust I've made so far. So simple and so easy to make. I made a homemade chicken pot pie with it (doubled the recipe) and it turned out so flaky and yummy. Will definitely keep this recipe for future baking!

I love that I his crust is natural, I do ‘t Want to be feeding my family trans fats. Though I probably did this all wrong, meaning I over mixed it and didn’t really get how to make a crust. It came out so delicious though not as flaky as it could have been. This crust is the best I’ve Ever had, will make again, being more careful to follow directions. Thanks for sharing’

This recipe is great, but I think the icing on the cake was the first review which explained that you should use unsalted butter and why it's important to keep it cold. I doubled this recipe and used it to make a 9x13 of chicken pot pie. It was the perfect amount to just barely cover all the pan edges and top. I didn't pre-bake the crust, and even the bottom came out crispy. Thank you!

Easy and excellent! I did refreeze the grated butter, and tried my best to not overwork the dough. Rolling out chilled product was a breeze. This recipe gives the true meaning to, "Easy as pie!"

This is my mom's recipe from childhood without the salt. Such a simple recipe still the only way I make my pie crust 36 years later, and I always get compliments on the crust! I use 1 1/2 cups of flour to start, it's almost always the perfect amount.  Saw some people talking about chilling the crust etc, I always have warmed my butter to room temperature put all ingredients in a bowl and use a fork to combine with short chopping strokes. When mostly mixed, place on flour dusted counter and kneed until smooth. You can keep making your pie from there or wrap and refrigerate or freeze the crust for later :)

Up until now I have always bought the store brand crust.  I love this recipe! It's so unbelievably easy.  I do add 2 Tbsps. of sugar but that's all i  do different . 
This is absolutely a keeper!

Excellent crust! It's important not to overwork to the rough and to let it rest to have a really flakey crust.

Toughest crust I’ve ever made. Not edible. I doubled recipe because I wanted a 2 crust pie, otherwise I followed the directions. I can’t figure out what went wrong. We ended up scooping the filling out. And serving it with ice cream.

Will make again. I did not have time to let the dough sit 4 hours or overnight. I let it sit in the fridge for about 20 min anit was fine. Nice buttery flavor.

This is the worst crust I have ever made. It was dry and crumbling with the recommended water. After chilling I even added more water. Because I hadn't made a scratch crust recently, I rated it a 2 due to my lack of recent practice.  Today I made a Crisco crust and it turned out perfect.

Maybe it was just me. But this pie crust was looking amazing up until it shrunk a whole inch in the oven.

So flaky and delicious! I always used a pre-made dough from the bakery of my health food store. I just moved and now have to make my own. I followed the recipe,  putting everything in the freezer in between steps. Crust is my favorite part of a pie. This was thick and flaky, one of the best I've had yet.

Great taste, easy to work with! I made this crust one time and it came out tough, what did I do wrong? How long do you bake it before filling , like for coconut cream pie? Will make again soon!

I made this crust for my home made chicken pot pie and it was perfect. So buttery and decadent. I only chilled for an hour and easy to roll out for my slightly thicker rustic pie.

I had to modify, a bit too dry for me, I added Greek vanilla yogurt instead of the water and it was great, flaky and great tasting.

Really tasty and simple to make! Original recipe should emphasize the fridge time (4 hours of chilling means this is NOT a 15 minute recipe). I was concerned when cooking it that the temperature couldn’t be too high or the top crust would char and the bottom wouldn’t be cooked through so i would recommend a lower temp long cook (300-350F 1-1.5 hours). Also this recipe makes ONLY a bottom crust. I doubled this and used it for a Chicken Pot Pie recipe and was very pleased with the result!

I use this recipe every time I make Pie even for Pot Pies. But, I use extra butter and roll it out to about 1/2 inch, fold in half, and roll it out again for an extra flaky crust

This recipe was okay. It was pretty easy to make but the cold and chilled butter just sat in my bowl as it was mixing. It took a long time until it finally started to blend. I recommend either softening your butter first, or knead the dough after adding butter. Kneading it was messy but got the job done. I doubled the recipe so I could do a top layer of dough and after my pie was done, I was pleasantly surprised.

I used this recipe to make the crust for individual ramekin pot-pies, and it is PERFECT. Buttery, flaky, and the top was nice and crispy. Just perfect. I have not had success making pie crusts in the past but this came out exactly as it should have. Thank you!

Good basic recipe.  Because water quantity is important in this recipe I would recommend that 1/4 cup of water be replaced with 4 tablespoons of water.  It should also be commented on that this recipe is for two half crusts, used as one upper and one lower crust.

I loved the way the crust came together and rolled easily after overnight in fridge.  But when baking, it melted into a sloppy mess.   DO NOT USE for a prebaked crust (like for a cream pie) because it just all slid to the bottom of the pie plate.  For a filled crust (meat pie) it worked better, but still the edges were melting /drooping off the edges of the pie plate.   The instructions  need more detail about how to bake/temperature/time/good uses of this crust.

This was the recipe I used for my first homemade pie crust. It turned out amazing! Light, flakey, just the perfect texture. I have used it several times since and have fallen in love! I normally only bake cookies and lately I've been branching out to cakes, pies and breads and all my new recipes I've collected are from allrecipes.com!

Used this recipe for my meat pies! The crust was beautifully flaky! The kids loved it! Don’t work your dough too long... if you do you can re-refrigerate it to stop it from drinking back.

This crust was absolutely amazing! I made this for thanksgiving couple weeks back. It was my first time making apple pie from scratch. My entire family loved the the pie, and no one could get enough of it, and it wasn’t too hard to make.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a buttery, crispy pie crust to delight everyone who tries it!!

Nice recipe!
I added 2 Tbsp of extra butter to make the dough "Mousseline", which means light and fluffy.

The dough almost came out like puff pastry with the butter pellets.

Also added 2 Tbsp of sugar to lightly sweeten the dough.

This recipe assumes some experience with cooking pastry, so I would like to add a couple of things.

The board and roller needs a dusting of flour, as will nearly any dough when rolling it out.

If it begins to stick while working it, dust it lightly with a bit more flour.

Cooking temp?
The magic temp for most things is 350 degrees, though you can go up to 375 if you wish.

The shell needs to be pre-baked, and the dough should be "Docked" (pricked with a bunch of holes, made with a fork).

This will stop the formation of air bubbles forming in the dough, and allows moisture to escape.

A piece of parchment set in the raw crust, filled with some pie weights or dry kidney beans can help the crust stay flay during the pre bake.

time?

Keep an eye on it, and you might want to lightly wrap a little foil around the edge of the crust during the final bake to keep the edges from burning.

Good crust. I doubled so I could make 2 crusts for pot pie. I froze my crusts for about 30 minutes then let them sit at room temp before working them since I needed them right away. It works so long as you don’t let it heat enough that the butter melts when rolling. It was flaky and delicious. I put the butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes and the water until crystals formed.

Best one I've ever made. Obsessed. Some tips: Do not add extra water, and roll out twice. Someone mentioned that you need to roll it out twice and this saved my life! Before you take it out of the fridge and start rolling it out, wash your hands with cold water. Roll out the dough, ignore the fact that the edges are probably very crumbly. Then roll it back into a ball. I refrigerated mine another ten minutes or so, then rolled it out again and it came out SO smooth and SO perfect. And it's SOOOO FLAKY!!! It's like a freakin' croissant. Incredible. Everyone is raving about this pie asking me how I did it.

Easy to make and tastes great.  Only change I made was subbing butter for crisco because that was all I had.  Will make again for all of my pies!

First time ever making a pie crust, and pie. It was a SUCCESS !! I read all the reviews before I made just to see if there were any tips and tricks to making the crust a bit more flakey. Everyone said to freeze the butter and I truly believe that's what makes the crust to yummy and flakey LOVEEEED it !!

Made it w/ pumpkin pie and got a few compliments on this crust! It was flaky, slightly crunchy and no soggy crust.  The flavor was perfect.  My favorite part about this crust is I can make it w/ butter, which I usually have on hand vs lard, which I really don't buy for anything other than making pie crust.  Butter is so much more versatile in this respect!  I'm definitely keeping this one!

I made this pie dough and it was the worst I've ever made!  I've been baking for 30 years and decided to try this recipe just to see if it would be a good flaky crust.  But it was hard, dry and flavorless.   The only good thing about it was that it rolled out nice.  I will never make it again.  Pie dough needs Crisco.  Don't use this recipe, my Thanksgiving pies were ruined...very embarrassing!

I have made this crust a hundred times.  It is so delicious,  I could even eat it without any filling.  My family loves it so much,  I have been asked to make it so many times! It is perfect the way it is.  Best.  Pie Crust.  EVER!

This is my go to crust for all pies! Turns out perfect every time.  I even blend it in the food processor with no problems, just be sure to do it on pulse so you can stop quick and not over work the dough.  I use ice water and frozen grated butter.

Used for sweet potato pie. This is a decent no frills pie crust. Messed up the first in the food processor and it became sticky and too wet. Tried again and made sure to only pulse until it stuck when squeezed by hand. Dont overwork your dough there is no saving it once you do.

Very pleased with this recipe. I didn't have time to let it chill before rolling it out for a quiche and it still came out great. I baked it weighted down with dry beans for 10 mins before putting my filling in it, which worked out very well.

Why buy crust dough with gazillion additives and chemicals when you can throw 4 ingredients in a food processor, pulse a few times and you get perfect dough. This was a very tasty buttery flaky crust. I used it for a quiche and it came out excellent. It baked well even in a glass baking dish with no soggy spots. I quickly rolled mine out about 1/5" while it was still soft, lined the dish and stuck it in the freezer for about 15 mins.

Followed the directions pie crust came out perfect.  Make sure butter and water are very cold.  I put the water in the freezer while I cut the butter into the flour.   I used a food processor to mix.

Turned out awesome!! Thanks so much! Coldness is key to flakeyness. Keep the bowl cold it seems to help me tremendously, I also chill the butter for a few minutes in the freezer after I cut it into smallish squares.

I use this recipe whenever I want a crust for pies, pastie or whatever I am baking at the time. I have used lard but it is not as flaky as far as I am concerned. I would like to have a recipe for a crust using good lard and butter  together but cannot find lard that is not hydrogenated. You are number one in  recipes  as far as I am concerned and I have been baking for over 60 years.

Great Pie crust. I followed the directions , found it a bit dry, but after a short rest in the refrigerator it was perfect. I think I would add a pinch more salt the next time. This is the only recipe I will use from now on.

Best crust I ever had! I doubled this recipe and added 1 teaspoon of sugar. It  was enough for a whole pie.  only let it chill for 2 hours, it was perfect. I egg washed the top layer and dusted it with sugar. heated the oven to 425 then lowered it to 375 and placed the pie in the oven, baked it for an hour.

Wonderful, turned out so flaky!! Makes one crush but great for galette!! It is like puff pastry!! Be sure to keep everything cold, don't over blend butter, and if it seems crumbly when you take it out of the bowl just press it together. It will work! Don't add too much water! We love this, THANK YOU for the recipe!!!!!!

It turned out great. I made one small addition.  I read a suggestion to make and chill the dough as directed, roll it out to approximate 1/4  inch thickness, brush on some room temperature butter,  fold into thirds and roll again slightly , fold into a square and re-chill for at least two hours. Similar to how you would make puff pastry. I made turnovers and my pastry dough was light and flakey.  Even the bit bits I had to rework were tender.    Thanks for my new 'go to' crust recipe!

This was an excellent pie crust, the very first I have made! It was amazing! The only thing I would suggest is to double the recipe. When I made this crust I never had enough for one pie. It was very thin and I had to shape shapes out of the very few pieces I had left for the top. Next time I'll know to double the batch before hand! Overall it was an amazing recipe and I would recommend this pie crust!

I followed the tips that chibi chef gave and it came out amazingly well! Very buttery and flaky, and perfect for a savory pie. I would add sugar if using for a sweet pie. I only refrigerated for 1.5 hours - everything else was perfect. I doubled the recipe for a bottom crust with a lattice top.

Excellent. I add a little bit more water as I find this recipe does not include enough, and 1-2 tbsp of sugar when baking a dessert pie. The best pastry-making tip I ever received was to feeeze the butter, then use a cheese grater to get perfect morsels of butter in the dough. And make sure everything is cold, cold, cold! 
Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm 59 yrs old and this is my first time ever making my own pie crust and it turned out perfectly!
I had a recipe using shortening which I didn't have on hand so I searched and found this recipe using butter.  I followed the advice of many and chilled my flour, utensils, etc before hand and grated frozen butter into the chilled flour.  I did not have time to chill the dough after mixing and had no problems rolling and forming the crust into my pie pan.
The crust baked was very tender, flaky, and flavorful.
So much better than bought pie crust!

Favorite pie crust recipe! This also works great as gluten-free. I usually use the PC gluten-free flour and at the very end AFTER you have the right consistency add an egg white. Add flour to make it not sticky then roll out. However,  gluten free does not refrigerate well,  so skip the cooling part!

I added more water and it still didn't make a ball.  I wrapped it in plastic put it in the refrigerator hoping the moisture would disperse throughout the dough but when I took it out the flour was still dry and the butter was hard.  I added more water in order to be able to roll it out .  After baking, as I expected, it was tough.

This unfortunately did not yield enough dough for a pie, at least in terms of having some for the top. If I were to ever use something like this again, I think at least 2 cups of flour would be needed.

This has been my go-to pie crust recipe for a long time, but I can't get over the fact that it is not flaky.  The flavor is good, but the texture is lacking.  I am now on a journey to find the perfect pie crust recipe that combines flavor and texture.

It is a great pie. I made it as per instruction and it turned out just the way I wanted it. Very tasty and flaky. My husband liked the chicken pot pie I made with this crust. He usually doesn't care much about the crust but with this one, he actually complimented. Thank you for sharing this.

It is very good, but it is crucial for butter to be as cold as you can get if with out freezing and not overy work the dough. I always, and this is for any recipe that requires cold butter (like biscuits), use a cheese grater on the butter and then stick it back in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before adding it to the recipe. Then you already have fine butter and all you have to do is give it a quick mix to incorporate it, rather than having to cut it in.

FLAWLESS!!  This is the best  crust ever!  Perfect, flaky, delicate, delicious!  It made enough to do 3 bottom crusts or 2 bottoms and 2 basket weave pies.  Although I think you need a great recipe to make a great pie, it's really all about the handling of the ingredients.  I grated up my butter very finely, and let it rest in the fridge for 6 hours.  Everything must stay cold  or the butter doesn't make wonderful layers, it, just glues everything together.  AVOID over-handling!!  If you want a perfect crust, you can do it with this recipe and a little practice.

Best crust I've ever made!  I followed chibi chef's notes to add 7 tablespoons of ice cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time; and then to not overwork the dough.  This pie crust reminds me of crunchy puff pastry.

I made this to go with Chicken Pot Pie IX from this site.  I followed the directions as written.  When you heat it up in the microwave the crust becomes tough.  Otherwise good.  Thank you for the recipe.

I use chilled liquor instead of ice water. Alcohol inhibits gluten development, limiting the danger of overworking the dough. I've used amaretto, plain vodka and infused vodka. It depends what sort of pie I'm making.

Absolutely delicious. We doubled it and used it with a chicken pot pie recipe and it was amazing! Will make again.

I took other reviewers advice. I put the butter and ice water in the freezer for a few minutes before using. I did not use my kitchen aid. I tried to work the dough as little as possible, just until it came together and was still in fact a little crumbly. Also tried to make sure that my hands were cool by running them under cold water.

This is a good basic pie recipe using butter.  I used cold ingredients & turned out a flaky, buttery, tender crust.  I used the recipe for strawberry, cream cheese hand pies.  I would definitely make this again.

This is the exact pie crust I learned to make from my mother so long ago.  It's almost completely foolproof - just keep the butter and water ice cold, mix as quickly as possible, don't overmix, and cool it again for several hours in the refrigerator before rolling it out.  I think all butter crusts taste so much better than those made from shortening, but I grew up with butter only, so my tastes are skewed.   Also, you do not need any fancy equipment to make excellent pies; I just use my fingers and 2 forks to cut in the butter, and an old scrap of marble to roll out the dough.  Just make sure your hands don't heat the butter too much or you'll have a greasy pie crust.

Excellent crust!  I put this together in my food processor and it worked great.  I cut in the flour, salt and cold cubes of butter and then quickly pulsed the water in.  Only a few pulses so that I didn't overwork the dough and make it tough.   I used unbleached all purpose flour which tends to need a little more water (plus I live in a dry climate) and used the full 1/4 cup of water.  I worked quickly with the dough which meant not getting too fussy with the crust edge and it turned out flaky and delicious!  I did not refrigerate my dough - I just made sure the butter and water were very cold.  This is my go-to pie crust now!

Be careful!  The photo shows a two crust pie, but the recipe is only for one crust.   It's a nice flaky crust for sure, but this is an oversight I needed to mention because it sent me into a tailspin at the time of rolling it to top my pies.

This is a GREAT recipe! I had an extra pie crust that I didn't know what to do with and settled on making an apple pie. Looked up recipes for a pie crust to use as a top crust and stumbled across this one! Made it exactly as written and I must say, this is a flaky, buttery crust and it is wonderful! I will continue to use this recipe!

Excellent simple recipe. This is essentially the same recipe my mom used way back when.  She sometimes used lard which also works well but who has lard on hand these days? Highly recommend this recipe.

Have tried many times to make pie crust and never succeeded. This was a first! Finally understood that I shouldn't try to make the pie crust dough look like what you buy from the store when you form the ball of dough. If you look at the ball closely you should see the small pieces of butter under the flour that binds it together. That's why you want everything so cold. So those little pieces of butter don't melt into the dough. It is only after rolling the dough out after it has rested that it will look more like what you are used to seeing uncooked frozen pie crust. Baked light and flakey. Thanks!

This is a great pie crust recipe. I doubled the recipe and made a chicken pot pie (baking the inner crust for 5 minutes prior to putting in hot mixture). Also, I cubed up the butter and put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes prior to mixing. I do not have a pastry cutter so I used my "Ninja" - pulsing about 10 to 12 times. Perfect! Wrap in plastic wrap and into the frig. Rave reviews of the flaky crust!

This crust was very nice.  I am not a crust lover so I added a bit of sugar and a splash of cream to help my tastebuds out.

The crust was flaky and I was careful to not over knead it.

Everyone liked it!

Ok, I work in industrial bakery and we make bread and rolls but not pie. I've tried a few different recipes  and never got a flaky crust. Today I tried this one and I finally got a flaky crust but i made a few changes.  I was making a apple pie so I doubled the recipe .First I put the flour in the freezer, I never heard of this but the head baker at work said he keeps his flour for pie crust on the freezer. Next I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. The butter was in the fridge and I didn't cube it. The shortening was room temp. I used a pastry blender and shortening firmed in the cold flour. I used more ice water  1/2 a cup just was not even close to get the dough to come together. I wound up using about a cup of ice water. I put it in the fridge for 4 hours. My wife bought a pie crust roller,  clear plastic round about 12 inch in diameter with a zipper around the perimeter. I floured the inside and used a rolling pin to roll it out. Made the job easier and much less messy. The pie recipe called for baking at 350 but I used 425. Funny thing is, the recipe call for 1 hour bake time at 350, at 425 it still took nearly a hour to bake.  I can see this crust is flaky and has a nice color. I think the cold flour and higher oven temp. was the key for me.  I give this 3 stars because of the changes I made to get a flaky crust.

It truly is a the flakiest crust I've  made but, after multiple tries,  I can't seem to get it to survive a blind bake and still maintain shape.  Not giving up on this recipe, though. Followed the directions and the suggestions in many reviews to keep everything cold. Found the dough to be very cooperative - with this one exception.

I made a chicken pot pie with this crust and the crust was better than the filling! I love this recipe and will continue to use it for any pie and cobbler

Extremely simple recipe, couldn't have been easier. I started with frozen unsalted butter (I stock up on butter and keep it in the deep freeze) and cut it as soon as it was thawed enough to put the blade through. I had to add a tiny bit more water than was called for, but not a lot. I only let it rest in the fridge for an hour or two rather than the full recommended time (since the butter was still cold and in small chunks when I finished). I had no issues rolling the dough out on my measure mat. The apple pie recipe I used called for me to paint egg white on the inside of the crust before filling and I did, the crust turned out beautiful, flaky, and delicious. I did use an aluminum pie edge cover about half way through baking to keep it from getting too brown before the rest was finished. I will definitely be using this recipe a LOT more now that I've found it.

Scrumptious, made it for Thanksgiving. Made 1 crust but had to clear table afterwards to roll out (silly me) butter got too soft so I just made one out of a 4 crust batch. However I put it in the fridge not the freezer and well of course it got hard as I should have frozen it but anyway I then took it out and let it soften then I just mashed it into pie plate for a cherry pie which required top and bottom of course. It was so easy and no worries, crust was perfect. Baked at 425 degrees for 45 minutes! Will be using it for Christmas, thanks Dana!

This is my first time ever making a pie crust, but how fortunate I am to have found this recipe!! Used to just buy ready-made crust from the stores, but there's not such thing at my home country. I was so dreadful, and I don't even have proper equipment...

Turned out wonderful. Gave me a huge confidence boost! All the reviews are helpful, too. Highly recommend for those who just know how to do the basics (like me). Thanks, y'all!!

I have made tender, flaky pie crust for years using shortening.  This is my new favorite.  Pecan pie with this buttery crust is amazing!  I cut the butter into small pieces then put back in the fridge for about half an hour.  I cut the butter into the flour/salt by pulsing in a food processor but add the cold water by tossing with a fork.  This mixture will seem to dry at this point.  Resist the urge to add more water.  I cover the pastry mixture with plastic wrap and sit it aside (not in the fridge) for a couple of hours.  Then I roll out on a flour dusted pastry cloth.  The amount of water is dependent on the humidity so you may not need the entire 1/4 cup.  Also, I agree with the other posters.  DON'T OVERWORK THE DOUGH.  You want to see small clumps of butter.  That's what makes it flaky.

I actually mixed the dough in the food processor and it turned out beautifully flaky.
I made sure to pulse the flour and butter until crumbly, so as not to create too much heat.  As I added the cold water, I pulsed again until it just started to bind together.  I know that keeping the dough cold is what makes it flaky.
I will definitely use this all Christmas season and beyond!

This made a fantastic pie crust.  I doubled the recipe and ended up using a little more water than listed -- just enough to bring the crust together.  Everything was done by hand -- you do not want to overwork the crust.  I used it for an Apple Pie, which I backed at 375 for around half an hour then lowered the heat to 350 until it was done (about another half hour).  The crust was perfectly flaky and the bottom crust was excellent -- not at all soggy.  This is my new go to recipe for pie crusts....

This is an excellent crust and it is very easy to make. Follow the directions as written and it will work.  Note: This is a recipe for a single crust so you will have to double it if your pie will need a top crust.

This crust was very easy to make. Buttery and flaky. I made a homemade pumpkin pie and it came out fabulous with this crust. This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I used frozen butter and I pulsated it in my food processor with the flour.  Then I removed the mixture and added 2 tablespoons of ice water. The dough came together very quickly. I immediately put it in the refrigerator for about a half an hour. Any longer it would've been hard to work with.  It rolled out beautifully. I used a silicone mat which was great because The dough did not stick.

I make this regularly. I usually add a pinch of baking powder to make an extra flaky crust for custard and cream pies. To bling bake: 350º for about 15 minutes should do (eye it though).

When you say "15 minute prep time, ready in 15 minutes" I guess that doesn't include the 4 hour sitting time. Went step by step through the recipe and didn't see that part until I was cooking my pie the morning of.

I am a novice pie baker. Just make a few a year if that. I made the huge mistake of taking a family members recommendation and making a shortening crust. Disaster. I don't know why I did it, I've actually never had any problems with a butter crust. So,  that went into the garbage and then I made this. I am really trying to build up my "go to" recipes so I don't just search here every holiday and make whatever. This crust was seriously easy to work with, tastes great and best of all....uses butter. I'm sure shortening crust can be good too but I will never stray again. Thanks for a great recipe.

If you want a little sweetness in your crust, dissolve some sugar in the water (easiest when boiling) and then chill it.

It was awesome! My first time making a pie crust ever. I don't normally like piecrust but I do like butter flaky and this was awesome I loved it. I followed the directions kept everything cold,  and it turned out great. I graded the butter with the cheese grater straight for my fridge which is cold and then mixed it with my hand. The only problem I had is when I took it out of the fridge the next day it was really hard. My French is really cold so I stuck it in the microwavefor a couple seconds before I rolled itout.  The bottom crust was absolutely perfect I laid it out nicely. The top when I think I might have warmed up a little too much and or put a tad too much water because I did add a little bit when I was mixing it. The top Chris was still flaky and delicious it was just breaking when I tried to lay it out. This was a test pie for Thanksgiving and I will obviously make it for Thanksgiving that Crust is definitely a keeper.

Amateur baker here. But I mostly followed this recipe and it worked out fantastically. The butter flavor goes great with apple pie. This recipe assumes that you know the techniques to really make a flaky pie crust. First of all, keep your butter cold. Then, diced your butter and refrigerate it again for a couple minutes. Invest in a pastry cutter if you can (I got mine from amazon for $10) rather than a food processor because it's easy to overwork the dough in a  food processor  and end up with a very tough dough. A pastry cutter can take a little getting used to but it's worth it in the end. Using your hands tends to melt the butter. Second, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE ALL THE WATER. I only ended up using half of my water. Do not pour everything in all at once. Add in ice cold water tablespoon by tablespoon, even a teaspoon if you like. Stop adding water if the dough sticks together when you pinch a clump between your fingers. it's going to be crumbly. That's ok. You're going to be rolling everything together anyway. Third, if you do choose to refrigerate, let it rest for a few minutes after you take it out of the fridge. Then roll it out once, gather it back into a ball, and roll it out again just to make it more pliable. Fourth, if you don't have any extra flour to coat your surfaces with to prevent the crust from sticking, you can sandwich the dough between two layers of plastic wrap. This also makes it easy to transfer into your pie pan. Fifth, I would not suggest prebaking

Easy!
I like to take a frozen stick of butter and grate it using the largest holes of a box cheese grater, as opposed to cutting the butter using other methods such as a food processor or pastry cutter.

instead of using butter I used dairy-free margarine because my boyfriend is allergic  to dairy and it worked fantastic! it was soo easy and fast to make. After i put it on the pan i docked it and blind baked it for 5 min. on 375 degrees and worked fantastic!

This is one of the better recipes I have used.I like the idea of using butter instead of shortening.One big problem I had,though:I wrapped up the dough balls and put them in the fridge overnight,as directed.I had two bricks when I took them out.I had to basically defrost the dough to make it rollable.Just use cold butter and water right out of the fridge.I mix mine with a Kitchen Aid mixer,so I just let it mix a little longer and it was pliable enough to roll.Just skip the putting dough in the fridge step.

Wow! I've seen others but this was the only one that worked with my skills. It was perfect for my pot pie - I don't like sweet crusts for that dish and I adjusted my salt depending on my ingredients to the pie.

I used it as one crust so it was thicker than it should've been but I really liked it. I will keep this recipe and add sugar for desserts and roll out thinner for other pies.

This crust came out well - I used it as the pastry for a Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe.  It was pretty easy to make (although I had to add some extra water to get it to ball up), and it was pretty easy to work with.  It did very well in a 9.5" Pyrex pie plate.  My wife said that she liked this crust better than others I have done in the past.

I actually  didnt like this pie crust as much as my shortning crust. 
I know it maybe somewhat better for you, unless you make pie every week I think its ok to use the shortning once in a while.
My company thought it was good, but it lacked in flavor to me.
It also takes way to long before you can use it.

For a first time crust maker I thought this was awesome! I made chicken pot pie, Carmel apple tarts, and peach pie. I doubled the recipe every time and it's always great. This will be my go to crust from now on.

Used for a chicken pot pie crust.   Because of time restraints only could refrigerate for about 30 min.  Not enough time--still too soft.   Ended up rolling between waxed paper and putting in freezer for about 10 minutes so I could peel off.  It was not a great looking crust, but, was very flakey and very good, none the less.  Will definitely make again but, will allow for 4 hours as recipe calls for.

Very good!  I used some tips recommended by other reviewers:
-I put butter in freezer for a little bit before grating it.  
-Then I put all the grated butter back into the freezer for a bit before cutting it into the flour.  
-I also used the tip of chilling the table surface with an ice pack for about 10 minutes before rolling out the dough.

Wow! Yum! Simple, easy, recipe. Doubled the recipe to make a double crust for a 9" pie. I cut butter in small pieces and put in freezer for 20-30 minutes, added 1 tsp. of sugar when I sifted the flour and sugar (as other users suggested the sugar), and I used 1 tsp. of vinegar with the ice water (only because that is what my mom always did). Handled as little as I had to to bring it together. Refrigerated about an hour before rolling out with plenty of flour to keep from sticking, turning over often. Sturdy crust recipe...I didn't have it crack or fall apart on me through any of the handling. What a delicious, brown, beautiful, flaky crust this yields. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is the perfect, classic flaky crust recipe. It tastes good and has the perfect texture. It goes especially well with apple pie. One time I didn't have enough unsalted butter, and I was forced to use some salted butter. If you use salted butter, just cut out the extra salt that the recipe calls for and it should be fine. You also may not have to use all the water- just add enough to make it form a ball. Only thing is that the crust was enough for the bottom of the pie, but not for the top. I made it a couple times after that with double the ingredients, and it made enough for a lattice top with just a little left over.

DELICIOUS!! I made this for the first time 3 weeks ago and since then I've made two additional pies because the crust is unbelievable. I am usually not a fan of pie crust but this one... I just can't get enough! Several people have asked for the recipe too. It's a definite crowd please and will be the ONLY crust I will make now.

I made this recipe and it turned out wonderfully! I prefer to fold the dough over on itself 4 to 5 times before rolling it out into its final shape (this makes the crust even more flaky). It's important to note that this recipe is for only ONE crust, so if you need a top crust you'll need to double the recipe and then divide the ball of dough after removing from the refrigerator.

We're fortunate to be living next to a large patch of wild Himalayan blackberries, and this crust perfectly complements the rich fruitiness of the berries, resulting in a product that any 5-star restaurant would be proud to serve!

I made no changes except I couldn't wait four hour 'fridge time' I gave it an hour.  I would definitely make this again. I love making pie crust in food processor. Very easy.

This recipe was the worst pie crust I have ever made. It was very tough. I tried not to over work the dough but I must have done something wrong. I did read the reviews and follows the hints  but it didnt work for me. I will not try this one again.

I've used the same Better Homes and Gardens pie crust recipe for over 35 years, and now this one 2x and it turned out fabulous both times. I'm never going back! I doubled the recipe, added a pinch of sugar and just refrigerated the two flattened balls of dough while I prepared the fruit. Perfect!

Definitely flaky; really great texture overall. A bit hard to work with I felt. It would warm up and get sticky during rolling out, making it tricky to get it in the pan and well-shaped in one piece. Taste was not the best I've ever experienced in a pie crust--good though! Would bake again.

I loved it! I used it for lattice for another pie and it turned out gorgeous! The only thing I would say is that you should take it out about five minutes before the suggested time, because mine browned up a bit darker than I would have liked it to.  
Edit:
Some hints I learned:
-Use ice water. This really makes a difference in how the crust turns out. 
-If you can, chill it for a few hours. It helps it roll out better. 
-When it says to dice the butter, use a cheese shredder straight into the flour mixture. So much easier than mashing the butter. 
-If you are baking it separate from the pie, put beans in it for weight. Then it doesn't bubble up as much.

It was pretty good. I only refrigerated it for about 15 minutes and in the end it wasn't flaky so that might have to do with it. It could use more cinnamon. It baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

Made this for my first time making a crust from scratch. It came out delicious! I didn't have a pastry cutter so I just used the beater from my stand mixer to mash everything together. I probably should have used a little more water because it was very difficult to roll out, and I think I'll try the grater for the butter next time, but overall this is my new go-to crust recipe.

I will be making this crust again. It was buttery and flaky, even when I made apple pie (with Grandma Opel's apple pie recipe- if you have not tried, I highly recommend. It can be found by searching the title and it is on allrecipes). I have tried many other pie recipes, but this one did the trick. I poured sugary liquid over the crust, sweetening the crust up, but if you do not have a very sweet pie, I would consider putting a spoonful of sugar in the crust recipe.

Okay so I've made this recipe about 5 times for blueberry pie...its usually a HUGE hit! No changes except the water (I live in FL) I use less and feel it out as I'm working it. DO NOT OVER WORK YOUR FLOUR! If you do it becomes hard. Also, I recommend making sure your kitchen is cold. The last time I made it my kitchen was probably 80 degrees and my crust was so tacky and awful. Plus I ran out of flour!!! Oh and I usually use salted butter. Used unsalted last time and it was rather bland! This recipe is  trial and error from my experience but all cooking usually is :)

I was needing to make a pie crust, but was out of shortening and only had butter.  So I did a search and found this recipe.  MAN-O-MAN!  I will never use my old crust recipe again.  This is the best pie crust I've ever made.  Butter, Flaky, and just fantastic.  Husband said never go back to the old recipe, which was good, but said this is even better.  It puffed, with nice butter, flaky layers.  I wish to thank other reviewers for their tips, they were very helpful and ensured my first time attempt was a success!

This was the first pie crust I have made from scratch since Pillsbury came out with their refrigerated, already prepared pie crust and it was "fantastic".  I made a chocolate pie and the crust was crisp and flaky.  I even had to leave the dough overnight because I had something come up after I made it and it was still very good.  I will definitely make my own pie crusts in the future.

Excellent & as other reviewers said - main tips are to keep it cold and work sparingly. Put flour, bowl, measuring cup, pastry cutter in freezer for few minutes before making crust. Mix flour, salt in cold bowl. Remove butter from fridge and cut into small cubes then use pastry cutter to cut butter into flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Use ice cubes in cold water in cold measuring cup. Add water into crumbs 1 Tbsp at a time while tossing with a fork. Do not overwork the dough. The dough should have small bits of butter. Cool off hands under cold water, pat dry, gather the crumbs into a flattened ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate 3 hours-overnight. Take out about 10 minutes before rolling & may have to roll out twice.

A good crust if you can make sure you do not overwork the crust. I rolled the crust out between 2 sheets of waxed paper and followed the advice to use ice cold water.

Like all the other cooks say, keep your ingredients cold. I even put my pie pan and rolling pin in the fridge or freezer and put the crust in the fridge for 30 minutes after I've rolled it out. The only other tip I have that I haven't seen others post is:  freeze your stick of butter overnight (or longer) and grate it into the flour mixture. That will cut your mixing/cutting-in time in half and assure the pieces are small enough.

I didn't read the recipe ahead of time so I didn't have time to refrigerate it. I stuck it in the freezer for about 5 min instead, lol. The crust turned out beautifully in-spite of my over site.

It turned out really good , my crust came very flakey and tastey... The only thing is the next time I make it I would like to cut back a little bit of the butter.... I made a blueberry pie with this recipe.... My family loved it.....

Fabulous recipe!  I didn't have time to chill in the fridge for 4 hours.  45 min in the freezer (in a freezer ziplock bag) was perfect.  I put all the ingredients in my food processor and pulsed till they just formed a ball.  Don't over blend!

Made it, loved it...... The only change I made, was a quarter tsp of quick rise yeast, yeast rest for an hour, then to the fridge.

The yeast gave it some bubbles, and a little more bready texture. Still finished crispy and flaky though, very simple beginner recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times and have been quite satisfied with it. The recipe says that prep time is 15 minutes and it is ready in 15 minutes, but in reality, due to needing to refrigerate it for 4 hours before rolling it out and using it, it is really ready in 4 hours and 15 minutes. So, plan ahead!

Awesome crust! It comes together very nicely and tastes great. It's very easy to mold into the pie dish too, which is nice. No trouble with it falling apart or anything. This is my go-to recipe!

PS: I never refrigerate this and it rolls out fine. Who has the time?

Followed the recipe exactly and kept the butter crumbly and the water ice cold like some reviewers suggested, this was my first time making a crust and it turned out excellent! Very flaky and crispy :-).

This had everything I was looking for in a pie crust. I did not encounter the problem of too much water. Just absolutely make sure the water and butter are the coldest possible and to chill it for the proper time. It was flaky and a perfect addition to my quiche.

This crust came out hard and I could barely cut through it much less chew it.  There was too much butter and it literally pooled as the crust baked.

It's hard to find a pie crust recipe that isn't so stiff you can't roll it out. This one is a really nice soft dough, easy to work with. I always add my water 1 tablespoons at a time because we move a lot and different climates, times of the year etc will change the amount of water you need. I'm lazy so I didn't refrigerate before rolling it out. It still turned out nicely. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a really good crust! I find that the water-to-dough ratio is a little off, but as long as you know what the consistency should be you can make the necessary adjustments.

I've been looking for a pie crust recipe that is foolproof and this one is just that.   I have made a few different recipes and they are either to dry or wet and fall apart on me.  I used a couple of tips from others using my food processor to cut in the flour and butter then emptied it into a bowl and used really cold ice water.  I rolled the pastry out a little folded it up put it in wrap and then put in the fridge to rest overnight.   Next morning let it stand at room temp for 10 minutes and then rolled it out.

The butter in the crust melted, compromising my filling as well as the browning of the crust.

Not to mention it became so tough and hard to cut into let alone chew. And I baked it for just as long as it took to brown and the filling to fully bake.

My go to recipe for pie crust. I don't have a decent food processor so I grate the butter with a cheese grater. I also use about double the amount of water the recipe calls for.

I've been making this crust for a few years now, and never rated or review it! I make this in my food processor, and it always turns out great. I pulse in the cold, cubed butter, and then just pulse once or twice while drizzling the ice cold water. I get my sheet of plastic wrap laid out on the counter, and then dump the mixture right onto the plastic wrap, and use the wrap to gather it together into a disc, and then wrap and refrigerate. I would mention that this make JUST enough dough for a single crust pie. If you are wanting a little left over dough to make decorations with, there really isn't enough dough for that.

I used this to make an apple pie for my son's thanksgiving party and it was an extreme success... my lattice with this recipe looked absolutely amazing... i cant wait for all his classmates to love it! 

I would also like to add that this is my very first crust from scratch but luckily, i have baker's intuition for all of us bakers out there... i didnt even use a pie pan i used a regular aluminum pasta pan and one round of this was enough to line the inside and another round to lattice... i think i will be making crusts until the end of time, lol... 

I would also like to thank everyone and their suggestions because god knows that sometimes important things are left out of the recipe or you just dont understand completely and thanks to some of these reviews, my first crust on the first try was successful =)

This crust is excellent.  I really like the all butter crust, and just made sure to use ice water, handle sparingly, and use very cold butter.  If for some reason I have my butter in the freezer getting colder I will put the bowl with the flour and salt in the fridge to keep it cold.   I'm actually making it again now because I want to see how it comes out for fried pies with an apple filling.   When I made this crust for a sweet potato pie I also made a double crust pasty from a different recipe also all butter and very good, however this one kept popping into my mind.  No sugar was added to the crust, and there was a sweetness to it that stood out from the sweet potato.   Really, really good.

This recipe is fantastic! A few precautions: make sure your hands are cold when you work with the dough, don't over-mix, and add water slowly-- the less water you can get in while having it form into a ball the better, from my experience.

this is my usual pie crust base for both savory and sweet pastries. i usually add to it to adapt to the recipe i'm preparing, but as a base recipe, it's pretty tried n true... the main thing in light, flaky crust-making is not to overwork the dough. the chemistry of this recipe works... the technique is up to the cook.

Absolutely the best crust I have ever made! I have only just realized my interest in the culinary arts, and this recipe is totally fool proof! I like to. add a bit of cinnamon to it for certain pies. I have found that the amount of water varies a bit depending on the weather! All in all, I won't even look for a different crust recipe!

I followed the advice of Chibi Chef and this crust turned out fantastic.  I could not believe how light, tender, and flaky the crust turned out.  I chilled both the butter and the water in the freezer until the water started to form ice crystals.  After working the butter into the flour I worked the water into the mixture 1 tsp at a time just "fluffing" the water into the mixture as I went.  I did not work the crust any further after all the water was added.  I then formed the crust into a ball and refrigerated it for about 24 hours.  I'll never use another crust recipe

This was easy to make.  I was a little worried when I took it from the refrigerator, and it was rather stiff.  About 20 minutes later, it rolled out beautifully!

The stars speak for themselves, I would just like to give an additional tip for those who grate the butter. I divide it into four parts taking one part at a time out of the freezer, grating it directly into the flour and every few grates mix it into the flour otherwise it all sticks together in lump. Before grating the next part of butter, I put the bowl of flour in the freezer for a minute just to be sure the butter doesn't melt. Thanks for the recipe :)

I used this recipe for my time time ever making a pie.  It turned out fabulously!  Crust is always my favorite part of a pie!  I will say, I had some trouble getting the crust to roll out wide enough to cover all the edges, but that's probably user error.

This was an excellent crust. It's very flakey and has great flavor. The first time I made it I did make changes, I made it with half butter and half shortening, and I added vanilla and cinnamon. I used it with an apple pie. I'm making it right now for hand pies and an apple pie.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe. I made it with the stated ingredients with my Kitchen Aid dough mixer and it came out perfect. Changes I made: I took the advice and put my butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes then grated it. I put the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes then in the refrigerator while I made the rest of the filling (I made a pot pie) and it rolled out very nicely. I will make it again.

fantastic. I have made this twice and the second time I substituted lard in place of a little under half of the butter. It worked really well. very flaky and light. I found I needed  more water than a 1/4 cup to bring it all together.

Great crust recipe for chicken pot pie! I didn't add any salt, because I was using salted butter. I also added a dash of sugar. I didn't have time to chill it, so I just rolled it out after I had mixed it. It turned out great! Thank you for this recipe! =)

After an hour in the oven I scraped off the dough just as uncooked as when I put it in. I don't understand but I will not make this recipie again. No other pie crust has ever been this terrible. Also I did not use the large amount of water called for in the recipie probably only a few tablespoons ( i measured out the called for amount and added small amounts)

This crust was interesting. It was incredibly flaky, but also at the same time the texture was kind of tough, so it took a bit of work to chew. It wasn't at all similar to the pie crusts I'm used to, but it worked well for the chicken pot pie I was making.

This is the best pie crust ever! I have made it a bunch of times. It's good for savory and sweet pies. This dough is easy to work with. I have been in a huge hurry and pressed the dough into the dish without chilling and it still came out amazing. I have also let it chill for 2 hours and it is equally as good. I will always use this recipe. It's easy, flaky, and I don't have to deal with shortenings which are hard to find where I live and often contain gross ingredients. Thank you!

Made this to top the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe. The crust turned out perfect, buttery, and flaky just the way I wanted. I didn't refridgerate it but I did freeze it for about an hour. It has simple ingredients and instructions, was easy to work so it's kinda idiot proof. After adding the cold water I noticed the dough didn't form into a ball like I expected it to, instead of adding extra water in I suggest instead you first try molding the mixture together with your hands because it likely doesn't need any extra water.

I have nothing to compare this recipe to, since this was my first attempt at making a pie from scratch. This dough tasted awesome and was incredibly flaky. I used ice cold water..(had ice cubes in my bowl)..and measured it into the dough about 1- 2 teaspoons at a time. Also froze my pastry tool in the freezer before using to keep it nice and cold. Definitely don't over work the dough..i turned my dough on to the counter top when it was all still crumbly and just brought it together with my COLD hands. ..wrapped it up and placed it in the fridge for 4 hours. When i was ready to roll it, i was worried at first thinking..how can i roll this out large enough for my pie plate?..well it only took about 2 minutes and it was a piece of cake..or should i say "piece of pie" (HA) Will be making this time and time again!

Exactly the texture I like in a pie crust. Did not have time to chill adequately, so it was delicate, had to patch it, but it was so good I did not care that it was a little hard to handle.

Turned out flaky and delicious! I brushed the bottom with egg yolk and the peaches stayed in place. Also put the dish with the bottom crust in it in the freezer while I rolled out the top. I believe that helped keep it light and layered. Will use this recipe as my " go to" recipe!

I thought the flavor of this crust was pretty good, however I was hoping for a little more flakiness.  This could be due to my inexperience in making pie crusts, though.  It was extremely easy to make, especially using the food processor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Dana!

Spectacular success. Used the Chef John's Peach Pie recipe on this site, and doubled the crust recipe to make the crust and a lattice top. Pie gone in one day among 3 people. Had to make another one the following weekend by popular demand. EVERYONE raved about the crust! Perfect!

We had to substitute flour for gluten-free flour. My son has never made a crust before and decided to give this one a whirl. We used it for making hand pies and this crust worked very well. I think we'll add a touch of sugar for next time but I can see making this again. It was easy and tasted pretty good.

This basic recipe is good, and it also right out the ancient, but still relevant, cookbook The Joy of Cooking.

I double the recipe. I also don't put in the fridge. I leave it in the bowl covered with a towel. Then when I'm done with my chicken pot pie filling I roll it out.

This is probably the nicest pie dough I've worked with. It doesn't break apart when rolling out and tastes delicious. I brush with heavy cream and sugar before placing in the oven and it's perfect. Thanks!

Perfect pie crust. Easy to make with a food processor. I would recommend adding the cold water by the tablespoon as I needed only 2 tablespoon of the 1/4 cup of water.

This is a really good recipe and always turns out nice. ive made it many times, and only about once it was perfect. otherwise its too sticky or too dry, but in the end of the day, after you've baked the pie or whatever, it TASTES SOOO GOOOD!!
but yeah. i haven't made it with food processor, so maybe if you do that, it'll turn out better.....idk

I love the flavor, but I still have trouble with the balance between getting it to roll out and overworking it. And why is it that I always seem to need more icewater than is called for in the recipe? I do buy flour in bulk and store it a long time (in a cool dry place, sealed container). Is my flour dryer than that of other people?

Had a really hard time with getting it into the dish, in the end the edge fell into my pie (I think it got bumped in the oven, or was just too soggy) and it didn't really turn out that flakey.

Very simple and buttery. You can always add a tlb or 2 of sugar for a sweeter crust if doing desserts. When the pie is almost done, I brush a combo of egg and cream on top and sprinkle sugar. This was one of my Grandmother's tricks. It makes the crust pretty and gives a nice sugar crunch.

first time I made my own pie crust.  Followed exact.  EASY!  and came out great!  I did not freeze my butter as other reviews mention, just cold from fridge, and I used a pastry cutter to cut butter in by hand and it only took a few minutes. I used it to make a pumpkin pie and cooked it in a stoneware pie plate.  Everyone loved it!

This pie crust is very simple and tasty for a beginner such as myself. If you don't use proper crust technique (see chibi chef's review) it will be floppy and tough but tasty. This is the first from scratch pie crust I have ever tried and chose it for its simplicity and few ingredients. My crust did not look like the picture! I do look forward to taking the suggestions of other reviewers and perfecting this basic recipe.

I have used this recipe so many times! It is WONDERFUL! I did try making it with margarine, which didn't work, so stick with butter. Thank you so much for this recipe!

The crust was not as flaky as I thought it should be.  I will try it again, maybe my technique was off. Taste was good.

I made this crust to use for a quiche that I made for a brunch. It was a huge hit. I made enough to fill a 9x11 pan and it turned out wonderful! I will use this crust again to make a sweeter dish next time, to compare the best way to use it. Thank you for the recipe!

I used this crust with a chicken pot pie recipe. Perfect texture, and easy with processor. I added some curry powder , pepper, and a little garlic powder to the flour...we thought it was really good!! Thank you for giving us this simple, yet , great recipe!

I made a chunky beef pot pie and used this recipe for the pastry top tonight.  I normally use shortening for pastry but when I saw this recipe I had to try. The pastry came together well, I chilled it for about 2.5 hours.  I knew not to overwork the dough when I rolled it out.  I have to say this buttery flaky pastry complimented the savory beef stew better than my usual pastry top. I enjoyed this recipe and can see trying it for other recipes like dessert pies, tarts, and cheese straws.

I wasn't real impressed by this crust recipe.  It looked greasy while baking.  Maybe I rolled it out too thin, the edges were crunchy in places and it tasted like butter and flour.  I ended up using more than the 1/4 cup water.  Any suggestions?

It's not like a piecrust. It's more like a dough. Like a breadough. It doesn't roll out like pie crust. It does not roll out flaky. It rolls out like when making rolls , etc. Haven't eaten it yet. It's too hot. but will post a photo and update latger.

Amazing byt i found most effective was cute butter into cubes, freeze it for a couple minutes. Then mix flour and butter together with you hands. Butter should be a little flat then add water and mix with my own hands. Came out super flaky just the best!

perfectly flaky as long as you only use 2 tablespoons of water. the dough should not be gooey (which is what happens when you follow the recipe to a tee).

I like how this crust came out. I used a food processor to mix the ingredients. I prefer to use one instead of other techniques to keep the mix cold. Tasted delicious for the mini apple pies I made.

This is a really good pie crust and I have used it often. For those that are having trouble with it patience is the key. You just need to make sure that you work the ingredients to the right consistency and not overwork it. Add your water a little at a time until it forms a ball. I double the recipe and only used two tablespoons of water. You want to see little bits of butter when you are finished. I tried using my kitchen aid for this and decided it was easier to do it with a pastry cutter.

I love this crust. I have made it 6 or 7 times and live how easy it is to make. Not only is it easy to make, but it also cost less then the already made pie crust. I not only use it for my chicken pot pie, have have also made it with apple pie.

Double for two 9" crusts. Used frozen butter cut into large chunks, blended with flour in Ninja. Added ice water, but not full amount. Used salted butter and didn't add salt, but next time I think I will add at least a pinch. I put the dough in the freezer for a few minutes while preparing pot pie filling and then put it together. Came out beautifully flaky.

Excellent crust! I doubled this recipe for a bottom and top crust to go with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe (also on this website). After trying this 6 times I found that I could bake the dough right away as opposed to leaving in the fridge overnight with no difference in taste. Well recommended.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving pies.  The crust was buttery and flaky, just as advertised.

So freakin yummy and flaky. Note to self though there are two cups of butter in a pound so do NOT use half a pound of butter for this recipe! LOL

This is the tastiest pie crust ever!! I didn't have time to let it rest 4 hours in the fridge, it was about 45 minutes and it still turned out buttery and flaky. It's so simple to make that my 13 year old daughter made it twice and it was awesome.

Tried this recipe for pumpkin pie-this may work better for a two crust pie but for a pumpkin pie it shrunk, pooled butter around edges and didn't cook properly on bottom. I keep rethinking how I made it and maybe I did something wrong before but I wouldn't try this again.

Finally! After 39 years of looking for a pie crust that rolls out easily and can transfer to a pie pan without falling apart.  The dough is like elastic. I stumbled upon this recipe on Thanksgiving morning.  I made it in my food processor.  It is also very tasty! Thanks to the person that submitted this recipe.

This crust was very easy to roll out, and the finished texture and flavor were perfect. As it was baking (I used it for a sweet potato pie), the whole house was filled with an enticing scent and the crust's flavor lived up to that olfactory promise. One note: keep an eye on it as it bakes, because the edges will burn in a  hurry. You may want to rotate your pies or cover the crust with foil or  a commercial crust protector to avoid this. Other than that, it was great even though I was only able to refrigerate it for 40 minutes.

Best crust recipe I've ever used. Perfect buttery flaky crust. I put the butter in the freezer for 15 minutes before the flour, salt and butter in the food processor and pulsing it until crumbly. So pleased with the result. My crust recipe search is over!

Just made this recipe last night and it is by far the easiest recipe I've used.  I don't make pie crust often so it is really hard to make a good one, but not with this recipe.  I took a pinch off one of my pies this morning and it is very flakey.  I did use half unsalted butter and half Spectrum Organic All Vegetable Shortening and it turned out GREAT.  I did not have the time to chill my dough and I think this crust is fabulous, but I will chill it next time to see if it make any difference.

First thing, 1/4 cup of water is still too much water for this amount of flour. You'll end up needing to add more flour. Even after having to do that, it is not enough crust for a whole 9" pie crust pan. It barely fit the bottom of the pan and there was no crust left for the top of the pie. I ended up having to delay making my pie.

Considering that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, this recipe turned out well. I didn't have time to allot for the four hour refrigeration,  but I read the reviews and saw someone had used it immediately and had great results. So, mine chilled for at least an hour.  I actually needed more water to get mine to form a ball. I thought that was odd, especially since I didn't see anyone else having that happen. Mine ended up being used for chicken pot pie soup, so I really wasn't concerned with perfection. I have no idea how this would hold up for a pie, but baked flat or used for turn overs,  it was great.  As I become more experienced I'm sure this recipe will be perfect.

This indeed is a beautiful flaky pie crust!  No changes were needed.  I used all cold ingredients which I assume helped.

This worked out great. I'd never made a pie crust from scratch, I don't think, and I was a little worried - I hear it can be a little problematic. I made this exactly as written, except that I thought to add another tablespoon or so of ice water to the dough to make it into a ball - it looked a little dry to me. Rolling out the dough and getting it into a decent circular shape was the hardest part. I used this in a somewhat overwhelmingly-flavored pie ("Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie", also on this website), so this crust kind of took a back seat to it. I didn't think it was overly buttery, as I'd thought it might be, and it was decently flaky. I can't quite say I loved this, but I'll save the recipe and probably try again, one of these days, perhaps with a simpler pie recipe, so that the crust can stand out more - sometimes I think crusts are the best parts of other people's pies.

This is the best and easiest pie crust I've used.(Sorry Mom - it even beat yours!) I took the advice to freeze the butter and grate it into the flour/salt mixture. I used a fork to work it in. I measured 1/4 cup ice water and added it 2 tablespoons at a time. I did not need the full 1/4 cup possibly because it was a very humid day in August. I refrigerated the dough overnight and found it to be easier to work with than my old recipe using vegetable shortening. The only problem I encountered was the crust takes longer to turn golden so I had to bake the pie slightly longer (5-10 minutes).

I used this to make a mango/peach pie.  This was only the 2nd time I've ever made a pie crust from scratch.  It too years to work up the nerve to try it again and boy am I glad I did.  I followed the instructions along with others suggestions about putting everything in the freezer, including my pastry knife.  It came out absolutely perfectly flaky, buttery, flavorful and yummy.  It was so simple and so good, i was just amazed.  I am proud to report that i am no longer afraid of homemade pie crust, thinking of making an apple pie now.

This was my very first attempt at making a pie crust and it came out amazing. It's literally fool-proof. I didn't have a dough blender so I used a fork and got good results. I did need to add a tiny bit more flour at the end but I could have been a tad more careful when I was adding the water in. I was taken back by the 4 hour refrigerator time and questioned if it was actually necessary. I ended up wrapping the dough in parchment paper and keeping it in the fridge for about 45 mins and it was quick and easy to work with.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I was looking for a pie top and bottom, and when I got it rolled there didn't seem to be enough for both. I also think they should rethink the "ready in" minutes. It's not ready in 15 minutes because the recipe specifically tells you to chill for 4 hours, or overnight. Next time I will use a different recipe.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! This recipe was amazing. I was super nervous about making a scratch pie crust for the first time since failing miserably many moons ago in my teens, but this recipe came out more amazing than I could have ever imagined. Buttery, flaky, very delicious, airy crust. I don't think I will ever bother to buy a crust again. PS, I put the crust in the freezer wrapped in wax paper for an hour to chill the dough so I did not have to wait the 4 hours. It worked perfectly.

1st time making a pie crust and it turned out great! I had to use about a tablespoon more of ice water because dough would not hold together with just the 1/4 cup of ice water

I've made this twice, and the first time it was light, flaky and delicious. The second, it came out gooey and dense (something I see other reviewers have also struggled with). I can't quite figure out why there was such a difference when I "think" I made the crust the same way... Could it have something to do with different fillings?

It went well with the "Pear Pie III" recipe from this site. Buttery delicious crust. Following some of the other suggestions, I agree that you want to handle the dough as little as possible. I let the food processor, rolling pin, and silpat do most of the dirty work so that I hardly had to handle the dough. I popped it in the freezer for a few minutes while I prepared my pie filling. Lastly, I brushed it with a little egg white (to keep it from getting soggy) before adding the filling and baking.

It turned out flaky and crispy with a hint of salt even though I used unsalted butter.  It was a perfect contrast to sweet, silky smooth strawberry custard pie.  A keeper, and I don't say that often.

I used as much water as I needed to make it the right consistency, a bit more than the recipe asked for. 

I was impatient and only waited about 2 hours after I threw it in the back of the fridge top shelf. 

SO GOOOD! I didn't think these hands could produce such awesomeness. THANK YOU!

The absolute BEST crust I have ever had.  I use this for sweet pies like apple and raspberry as well as savory pot pies.  The crust is just too good, makes me want to prepare it all the time!

I tried this recipe twice, hoping for a better outcome the second time.  After following directions EXACTLY, I still found the dough too sticky and messy to roll out, even after adding boo-coos of flour to compensate.  I skipped adding the 1/4th cup of water this time (holy moly!  I'd be drinking the pie crust if I hadn't left out the water!)  Any way, still a sticky mess.  The taste of the pie crust is okay but not what I prefer.  In short: messy and not worth the mess.  I'll keep searching for the holy grail pie crust.

Beautiful!  I didn't have time to chill the dough, so the dough was really crumbly when I rolled it out.  It did work out, and the pie was so good!  I brushed it with a little milk before baking.

Perfect flaky crust! I really tried to handle it as little as possible and I think that helped. I added ice cubes to my water, before slowly adding it. I don't think I used all 1/4 cup of water. I also subbed 1/4 cup of the all purpose flour for whole wheat. I used the crust in a chicken pot pie and it was heavenly.

I would have given it five stars, but it doesn't tell what temperature to bake at or for how long. I think this is important and should not have been left out of the recipe.

Love this pie crust b/c I don't want to use processed oils and fats. Using a natural fat, such as butter creates an even better flavor, and the crust is more flaky than one that would be made with shortening or crisco.  The only problem that I have run in to is when I have had to pre-bake the crust for a recipe such as a quiche, the butter melts and the crust shrinks in the pan, and I find myself having to pull the crust out during baking and stretch it back out.  The only solution I have come to for this problem is doing a non-traditional edge around the top of the crust, and just leaving it draped over the edge of the pie pan.  Leaving it draped over the pie pan holds the crust in place and it doesn't shrink the the degree it would otherwise.  Minus the shrinking crust, outstanding.

I followed this recipe today to make meat/cheese pies.  It is a beautiful crust that rolled out right away and could handle being rolled out pretty thin.  However, I blew it on the pies ...  they were dry (not the crust's fault).  The consensus at our table was that the crust seemed sweet; I just wish I had filled it with apples instead of ground beef and cheese.  For us, this is an excellent recipe for dessert things, but I probably won't use it again for savory dishes. I simply cut the butter in with a fork and then used my fingers/hands to truly blend the dough into its flaky self.

Beautiful!  Gorgeous! Flaky! Yummy!  I usually double to make a top and bottom crusted apple pie, and I butter the pie dish just to keep it from sticking.  Otherwise I follow the recipe to the letter and it's wonderful.

The dough is rather difficult to work with.  Mine was messy and there is no way I could roll it out into a nice circle to form the base of my pie dish!  It crumbles up.  It's just too soft.  What did I do wrong? 
Once baked, it was also too crumbly, it isn't at all "flaky", more "crumbly".  Smells good and tastes alright though.

This crust was delicious, but be careful using it for anything that needs to be refrigerated.  Butter vs. lard causes pooling in and around the crust that looks a bit gross when cold (but yet still very tasty!).  It was easy to roll and I got a lot of compliments on it.

I added more butter than called for, and it was very good. It required more flour and ice water worked into it
after chilling. I also added 1 tsp. of sugar, and it should have been a tablespoon. Huge hit at dinner. Used with both an apple and a pumpkin recipe. Easily handled food creating a lattice top.

Fabulous pie crust. I didn't need all of the water, as it appeared to come together without it. It was flaky and delicious. I've used it to make an apple pie with a lattice crust, as well as a sweet potato pie in the oven right now for Thanksgiving. I'll be using this recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe that I've used before but I would like to specifically thank reviewer 'Christi' from a few years ago who reminded readers that dough may be tough after refrigeration.  After a failed attempt at homemade chocolate pudding (way too runny) on Thanksgiving eve, when I went to roll out the pie dough it was hard as a rock.  I felt like a failure and started to think about buying desserts for thanksgiving when I started reading reviews and read hers.  I worked that dough and it softened and is in the pie pan now.  Time will tell if it bakes up good but it looks all right for now.  Thanks!

If your crust survives various family members picking at it before you even roll it out and bake it, you will have a pie with a VERY flaky and delicious crust.  My very picky husband thinks this crust is perfection and so do I.

Excellent pie crust! This was my first made from scratch crust. I made a double batch, top and bottom crust , for applepie apples   that I had canned. I also added two tablespoons of sugar ...scrumptuous, buttery and flaky.
This will be my "go to" pie crust recipe.

Can't stop making this crust! For about the last two years or so, I haven't made another kind of crust. I have used for chicken pot pie, apple pies, quiche, and mini pies. It has been perfect for all of them :)

It tasted good but the proportions for the water were a little strange.It seemed dry at first but it rolled beautifully after being overnight in the refrigerator and it tasted delicious. I'm definitely gonna use this recipe unless I can find one where you don't have to refrigerate it overnight.

I did not care for this recipe. The crust never came together, no way to roll something like  that out. Made this twice with the same results. A real mess.

It worked! I can't make pie crust... but I did with this recipe. I froze the butter, then grated it. Lightly tossed it with the flour, then slowly added the water until it formed a ball.

Absolutely my go to recipe for savory or sweet! I have used it for both chicken pot pies and apple pies and got rave reviews on both. Will not use another. If you follow the recipe and make sure the butter is cold and use ice water you won't go wrong. I didn't even have to use all the ice water or chill it in the refrigerator for more than an hour and still had great success. Thank you for the great recipe!

i used this recipe for a kale quiche i was experimenting with. only halfway through did i realize i didn't have 4 hours for the dough to chill. i threw it in the fridge while i worked on the rest of my ingredients. it was tough to roll out and i had to piece it back together in my quiche pan, but this was my fault for not letting it chill (plus i live in TX and it's august). i used foil and my awesome ceramic pie weights to prebake the crust at 350 for about 10 minutes. people who are complaining about no time and temp given are right, it's not listed... but it's not that hard to figure it out! average temp for baking ANYTHING is 350! and just check it every few minutes until it looks done! i'm sure the author didn't include baking time/temp because a lot of pie recipes don't require a pre-baked crust.
anyways, sorry about the ranting. so my experimental quiche turned out awesome. the crust was nice and crispy on the outside and soft with great texture on the inside. the flavor was great! i will make it again, and next time know that chilling the dough will be helpful in the rolling process. 
OH and i also noticed that the crust shrank as well after baking, but i was ok with that since i made it in my quiche pan and i wanted it to come out anyways! it came out very easily without having to try and use a knife or anything, no mess! and my husband loved it - and he's picky!

The perfect buttery pie crust. The only thing I did different was that I didn't have the time to let it cool in the fridge, so I formed it into a disc and wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 10 minutes (a Mark Bittman suggestion).  Also, I didn't have an egg to do an egg wash, so I used evaporated milk instead.  It turned out perfect!  Definitely do as the recipe suggests and sprinkle the flour/sugar mix on the bottom and then over the rhubarb.  I've always mixed it in with the rhubarb prior to this, but never again!  So yummy.  Had my boyfriend's aunt ask me to show her how to make pie crust!

The crust tasted more like a biscuit. It didnt taste buttery or light. Isthere a missing ingrediant or what did I do wrong?

I will definetally keep this for my go to pie crust!  I am horrible at making pie crusts, and this one seemed to work smoothly for me.  I made the crust in my food processor.  I only refrigerated it for 30 minutes and it rolled out just fine.

I followed Chibi Chef's guidelines for making this crust.  It was the first time I have ever made pie crust and it turned out PERFECT!  Novices should follow the Chef's directions.

Great Pie crust!  I made it twice.  It's always better the day after although it's extremely difficult to leave a pie overnight without devouring it.  No use for shortening even though it tends to make the crust a bit flakier it's not worth the bad fat.  
I highly recommend.
My pumpkin filling was happy!!!!

this was good, not as good as one I use with vinegar in the crust.  I had refrigerated it several days before making my pie, and it was still the same as if it was made that day, so it was not a mess at all.  Once looking at the other pictures, I may not have added quite enough water though to this.  Will try again if I need to go astray from the crust I love.

Best pie crust ever! Much better and easier than a lard crust. I followed the recipe exactly, however I skipped the cooling time and used the pastry right away. Turned out PERFECT!

I've been baking pies for 30 years and today decided to try a different crust recipe.  My family immediately asked if I used a different recipe.   They could tell after a few bites.   And they all loved my old one.    You can't go wrong.    Will definitely use again and again.

It turned out ok.  I was out of shortening so using butter was a good substitute.  I made an apple pie for my hubby and several fried pies for Grandad using this crust....tasted ok even if they did look like a big hot mess, because I lack an easy hand and, well, skill with pastry. Thanks for the recipe/

I have made this crust twice now.  The first time I used all purpose flour, and the second with white whole wheat because that's what I had on hand.  It was a little tougher to roll with the whole wheat but the end product was just as delicious as it was with the all purpose.  So don't be afraid to make this with wheat flour, it's still great!

This was my first attempt at making crust from scratch.  I didn't have enough time to refrigerate the dough as long as the recipes says but it still turned out great.  I will be making this again.  Overall it was very easy and yummy.

This was THE BEST CRUST EVER! I've always had issues making pie crust and this one turned out perfectly. I added 1/2 a tsp of baking powder to the flour mixture and had to put in a little extra water, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I think I might try it as a streudel dough too. The buttery taste was wonderful.

Flaky, yummy, buttery crust. I used this for the Three Berry Pie recipe but I made it into a tart instead. I only had salted butter so I omitted the salt. Used the kitchen aid mixer and it turned out perfect.

The flavor was wonderful, incomparable. Far better than crusts I've made with shortening, and, honestly, a bit easier. Followed the advice given by user "chibi chef" and couldn't believe how perfect the results were. Photos were especially appreciated. Used pie crust with "Chicken Pot Pie IX" by user "Robbie Rice". Followed others' advice to pre-bake bottom shell for 6 min. at 425 degrees, and end result was golden and flaky; not soggy at all. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Because I don't trust my health to shortening, I use this recipe every time I bake a pie. It takes a lot of patience for it to come out just right. I recently ran across a recipe for tartlets which use 1 stick butter, 3oz cream cheese whipped together for every cup of flour. No water is needed.  I think I will try this for my pie next time because the crust came out very flakey and tastey even though I had worked it quite a bit with warm hands.

This recipe is so simple and perfect. I followed it exactly (along with freezing the water and butter cubes). I rolled it out for a 9x13 baking dish and it was quite thin, but surprisingly delicious, do make sure to brush egg-wash on top with a tiny bit of sugar. It was perfect, thanks for a great recipe (and great tips).

This is my go-to recipe now. I've used it several times and it always turns out perfect! This last time I grated the butter per the advice of another user, and it worked much better. I think the time it took to grate the butter was less and easier than trying to get it to incorporate it otherwise. I needed a few extra tablespoons of water than what the recipe calls for. Also, I ran out of AP flour and had to substitute 1/4 cup of whole wheat and it was turned out great!! So flaky, rich and delicious!!

I don't like to cook with shortening, so I used this recipe for apple pie instead. It came out great! It is flaky and rich, and goes great with apple pie. Would definitely use this recipe again.

I like to substitute shortening for some of the butter, and keep everything really cold!

I don't know what I did wrong - I'm generally an excellent cook, and apple pie has been my specialty for a long time!  However, my grandmother used to make an all-butter crust (and I've been using 3 Tbsp Crisco in mine), so I wanted to try to re-create hers.  After reading the reviews, I was sooo excited to make this.  I used all cold utensils, frozen butter, super icey water, cold hands.  It came together very quickly and easily without much handling.  The only difficulty I had was rolling it out.  It kept shrinking up like pizza dough, so I feel that I did have to roll it out quite a bit in the end -  maybe this is what destroyed it.  I did make my two crusts in two separate batches, rather than doubling, and had the same issue with both.  Anyway, the crust appeared flaky on top, and the pie looked beautiful, but the bottom and edges were so tough that even my whole family agreed (even though they would have liked to have made me feel better about it!). So I gave this two stars because I want to give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it was something I did - otherwise, where could all of these great reviews have come from??  Maybe I'll try one more time . . .

This was good. I made this to wrap Apple Dumplings with Rich Cinnamon Sauce. It took longer to prepare this than the recipe said (which I was expecting). The crust didn't turn out to be very falky but it was fine. I really liked the fact that this recipe didn't call for lard or shortening

I had never made pie crust before this recipe and boy do I want to thank all the reviewers for the great suggestions. I used this crust for chicken pot pie and it came out flakey and delicious (just as promised!) Definitely husband aproved.

This is the perfect pie crust!!  I have made it several times and slightly alter it based on what I am making--more salt when making chicken pot pie, and when I make apple pie I chill 1/4 Cup apple juice in place of ice water, which was amazing!!  It is very important to be careful not to overwork the dough--like Alton says, 'JUST STEP AWAY!'  I like to keep the dough slightly on the wet side when I make it and put it in the fridge because when rolling out the dough you have to use a bit of flour, so that way it doesn't get too dry. This recipe is saved under my favorites and I use it about once a week.

I had never attempted pie before, let alone crust. This was so easy and worked perfectly with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie. It was so good, in fact, that we did it again the very next day.

This was a great recipe when I needed to make a homemade crust but only had butter!  I used it for my apple pie and my husband declared that the crust really made the pie!  I think it will be wonderful with a chicken pot pie which I plan to make later this week.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe. I haven't ever liked pie crust because it always seemed so bland to me. I have found the cure, butter instead of shortening. If you like pie use this crust to take it up to a new level. My father-in-law said my pie is better then his wifes and this is the crust recipe i use.

Used this recipe to make "Chicken Pot Pie IX". I used whole wheat flour instead and ended up adding a little bit more water.  I froze the butter in cubes and then grated it into the flour. I also put the water in the freezer as recommended by others.  The pie dough is a pain to work with so gave it a 4/5, but will likely make it again.

Fantastic dough recipe, I've had a hard time finding one without shortening; an ingredient that doesn't frequent our household.  This one does the trick!  I added some sugar last time for a dessert pie.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

it was gooey, not crisp at all. i have been using margarine for price value, and switched to butter for a fresh blackberry pie as a treat, and it turned out horrible, the bottom didnt cook at all and there was oily butter residue all over. ill give it one more try, but im so not happy.

The crust way amazigly flaky, just what I was looking for.  I doubled the recipie, I was making a deep dish peach pie and wanted two crusts.  For a nice glaze to the top crust I scramble I egg, well and brushed the top crust prior to cooking, and sprinkled sugar over the top crust half way through cooking for a little extra sweetness. I will definately keep this recipie.  Thank You!

I wanted to make a pie but had no shortening on hand for the crust. I found this recipe and was excited to try it out for my strawberry pie. The flavor was excellent but the consistency was very very dense and thick, not flakey. This could very well be from my own mistake (maybe I overworked the dough? I didn't think I did). The flavor was yummy and matched my strawberry pie well but I couldn't get over the texture.

I tried this recipe in a pinch because I didn't have any shortening for my normal pie crust recipe.  My chicken pot pie turned out fantastic!  My family raved about it.  It's our new "go to" crust.

This pie crust was super easy to make and I used whole wheat flour and it still came out delicious.  After I mixed the dough I did put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes.  This made it a little easier to roll out.  I definitely will using the recipe for all my future pies.

Very tasty crust!  I was using a more liquidy filling, and the bottom crust was a little soggy.  I would par bake the bottom crust before putting the filling in next time.  Great taste though!  It's now my favorite crust.

I made this crust for a chicken pot pie, and it was very good, although a little buttery for my taste.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my collection for later use.

I'm changing my review on this crust, and still giving it a 5 star vote since I figured it out.  For those of you that are a bit nervous around pie crust, like myself I did some things that made me NOT so afraid.  Everyone talks about not handling this crust to much this is true, but you have to handle to get it together.  So I put all my dry ingredients with my frozen butter into blender and blended it till the butter is quite small. (that part not so scary). Then with my VERY chilled water, with the "slight" ice on the top I added it slowly, stirring with a fork. Now I seem to need more then a cup of water, this is where it confused me because everyone was fine with just 1 cup. But I needed more to hold it together, I used my fingers slightly to see if it would stick together and then I stopped using water and put it quickly together into a ball and put in the fridge for a couple hours or overnight.  I made two crusts, one that turned out great, the other a bit moist still, but it was no worries when I rolled it out with extra flour, both crusts turned out perfect.  You have to handle the crust to find out your texture, the first time I did this it was too dry cause I was so scared to touch the dough.  This time, I did need more water, but I handled it till it felt like it would stick and it turned out great!  I will never change the recipe!

This pie crust turned out wonderful for me.  I followed the instructions and did not mess with the dough much.  I did have to use more water than called for to get the dough to form a ball.  It baked up beautifully and was very buttery and flaky.

My first "from scratch" pie crust, it was easy and very very good.  I doubled the reciepe and needed more water than was called for.  I also used all purpose flour but dusted my rolling surface with whole wheat flour for a bit of a twist.

This was my first time making my own crust.  This crust was absolutely divine!  I used light salted butter.  I left it in the fridge over night.  I needed some flour to roll this out, but it turned out beautifully with my Most Spectacular Strawberry Pie.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  I will try it with chicken pot pie next!  THANK YOU DANA!!!

I just tried this recipe today and I must say that I am impressed! I was skeptical of it only containing butter, BUT it came out flaky and flavorful. I do believe I've found my crust recipe for life! Thank you!

This recipe was AMAZING! Perfect pie crust recipe, I was looking for a recipe to replace my usual one with shortening, and this one was so flaky. Tasted delicious! Just made sure to keep everything super chilled and icy cold, and it was easy to use. I used leftovers to make little cinnamon cookies and they were delish! Yum!

Great basic pie crust! I normally use a recipe with shortening but I didn´t have shortening so I tried out this one - and it´s great! Everyone raved about this crust.

I like my good ol shortening crust better. The overwhelming taste of butter is almost gross. Also, the texture was too chewy. Granted, I might have not done something right - either didn't keep the ingredients cold enough, overworked the flour/butter, didn't chill long enough, or didn't bake long enough. I'm not sure.

2009: This will be my new standard!  Thank you!  I added a bit more salt because of what I was filling the shell with, and I made it in the food processor to save time.  Despite that and rolling out immediately without chilling, it still turned out perfectly!  The flakes are the best I've ever made with a non-shortening crust.
Edited 05/2018 to add: This recipe continues to be the only standard crust I use. The best application of it is with Grandma Ople’s Apple Pie from this site, and the scraps baked as crackers to munch before the picnic starts.

I did it! I made pie crust that actually turned out. This is the perfect crust for our family because my son can't eat shortening and I am vegetarian, so don't eat lard. My fear of pie making is starting to diminish. Thank you very much for the great recipe!

Fantastic-- I used this for chicken pot pie and it was absolutely delicious.  I cut the butter in with the food processor (I used very chilled butter) and was able to roll the crust out right away with no problems...

Absolutely delicious! I tried the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople on this site and used this recipe for the lattice. I froze the butter after cutting them into thin pieces, it made it much easier to handle. It turned out great! So flaky and buttery. Will definitely use it again!

This was my first time making a pie crust, and it turned out great. I made the mistake of adding too much water in my first batch (I made two), but I learned that kneading the dough more with the recommended amount of water will still form a flaky ball - no need to add another 1/4 cup of water! The taste was, indeed, both buttery and flaky. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a keeper!  I'd never attempted to make a crust from scratch before as it always seemed too daunting of a task. Not anymore! This was simple and the crust came out great. Thanks so much for this simple recipe. I won't be buying pre-made crusts again.

This came out beautifully!  I was in a bit of a hurry, so I stuck the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes before I rolled it out.  I par-baked it, put my filling in and refrigerated overnight.  I had a couple people ask me which recipe I used for the crust.  I made an elephant ear with the leftovers and it was nice and flaky like a butter-based crust should be. The key is the ice water and to handle it as little as possible.  Will definitely use again.  Thanks!

I will never go back to pie crusts out of a box ever!  This crust was much easier to prepare, roll out and the taste was hands down in comparison.  I didn't crack when I was placing it in the pie pan, and cutting pieces for the lattice top.  Even when I forgot to put cornstarch in my apple pie, the crust still held up well.  I added egg wash on the bottom and top crust.

This crust was fantastic! I used it to make sweet potato pie and the butter gave it an extra great taste!

Great for an apple pie.  My family absolutely loved it.  The pie was gone before I knew it.

This was great.  I did not have plastic wrap and can not wait to try the right way.  I used a zip lock bag.  You need to let your dough set out a bit before rolling if you leave in fridge all night. I put ice cubes in my water then I measured again before adding.  Even my kid that usually leaves pie crust ate it all.  He loves apple pie, but like I said usually leaves part of the crust.  Well not this time!  Thanks!

Turned out great. I had to add a little more water than called for because it just kept crumbling apart.

Great recipe!  I used this crust for the "Creamy Pumpkin Pie" found on this site (since there is no pre-made crusts here in Germany) and it was absolutely flaky!  The secret is to not over work the dough, as mentioned by other reviewers.  Will definitely use this again in the future.

It was my first time making pie crust and it was a success! Although I had to sub the actual butter for vegan butter since my boss is severely lactose intolerant, it still came out really well.  I can't wait to try this recipe with REAL BUTTER. =)

Very tasty pie crust. Easy to make too. I left mine in the fridge overnight, took it out the next day and let it sit for 15 mins before I rolled it and put it in my pie dish. I made a blueberry crumb pie using this pie crust, and it was heavenly!

Mixed feelings on this crust... I used 2x as much cold water, refrigerated the dough for about a day, baked it blind for 7mins (made tartlets), and it was so oily from all the butter at the bottom of the tartlet pans, I had to wipe it off with a tissue! I then let it bake for another 3 mins, and it was very flaky and crispy... very yummy actually. Good substitute for puff pastry, almost.

I would love some suggestions.  I have now made this pie crust twice, using exactly the same method and ingredients both times, but, the second time, my pie crust melted ALL OVER the bottom of my oven, and my apartment was a smoky mess the rest of the night.  I didn't have any troubles the first time, where could I have gone wrong to make it melt the second time?  I do like the taste of the butter crust (and have no shortening option because I'm living in Egypt), so I'd like to know how to avoid this mistake next time.  Thanks so much!

So easy. This was just what I was looking for. I needed a pastry dough to wrap around chicken breast and cheese,I was making for supper one night. It looked like a pastry chef had made it, and really delicious. The pastry was so light and had a delicate crunch. I ask my DH if he liked it. He said 5 stars,  then laughed, and asked me if I made it or bought it. I always made my pie crust, but this was so tasty and flaky. I be using this one a lot. Can't wait to try it in a pie.

This is the easiest pie crust recipe I have ever used.  I actually substituted the butter with some "Smart Balance" butter spread because that's what we use and it was SUPER easy to roll out and handle.  I didn't have time to chill it for 4 hours so put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes and that was all it really needed.  I'm ditching my mother-in-law's recipe and using this one from now on!

I followed the directions the best I could, though, I really don't know how to measure butter when it is cut up then put into a measuring cup.  Anyway, following instructions I gathered from the recipe and user comments I worked with everything in as cold an environment as I could. Lucky for me my hands are normally cold so body heat was never a factor. Also, I was sure to keep the mixing bowl inside another bowl filled with ice water. I mixed everything together without much trouble. I rolled the pie shells out the first time and they looked perfect. After placing them under and on top of my pie they trimmed down perfectly and folded together well. After baking the pie the crust looked perfect! As we ate it everyone said the crust was great and better than the oil crust I made last time. Thanks!

This is the first pie crust I have ever made from scratch, I chose it because it didn't require shortening because I didn't have any on hand. I did need to add a few extra tablespoons of the ice water. It was a very flaky crust and had a great butter flavor. I used it for Pecan Pie and it definitely was a hit!

I was raised by mother, grandmother etc too use Tenderflake for any pie crusts and have always had great sucess....but... I noticed most chefs use butter....and I thought... I would see why and I must admit it DEFINATELY gives a different taste, texture etc to ones pie crust as long as you do not over handle the dough; (which is the maker or breaker of most pie crusts)....this recipe is a 5 in my book and my dinner guests of course!!!!

This recipe was just alright. To me, it's not worth the trouble of working with the tempramental butter when I can get just as good a response from shortening with much more ease. The taste is fine, just not anything extraordinary beyond that of a shortening pie crust recipe.

The best pie crust ever! Butter gives it the excellent flavor.

Really great, fool proof, easy pastry recipe. Why do anything more difficult when this one is so good? I actually used it to make some jam tarts. It is very versatile. I rolled it out after only 1.5 hrs and it came out great. The reviewer who had a hard time getting her dough to come together in a ball probably did not actually use her hands to form it into a ball. This will be my permanent recipe.

Very good crust!  Easy to make and pay attention to the other raters.  Don't handle it so much and keep it and the ingredients cold.  I used it with "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople"  Excellent!

This was the best crust I've ever made. I've tried a few different ones, and this is the best. It was even good cold the next day. Like others, I paired it with Grandma Ople's apple pie. Yum! I also actually found it really easy to work with being so cold, but just in case I kept a ziploc bag filled with ice next to me in case my hands warmed up. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe does yield a great tasting crust, but it is NOT for beginners.  The recommended amounts of butter/ flour /water, yield a dough that is quite chunky, hard to manipulate, and without significant mixing work, marbled with butter.   You could probably get away with a bit more water to make it manageable (though not the additional 3/4 of a cup I once threw in, in a fit of frustration).  Other reviewers appear to have good advice for making this a success.  I haven't tried any of it, but I have noted how much work and attention would be required.

All and all, this recipe has its merits, but if you are willing to deviate from the traditional butter crust and get some shortening, you can find something tasty with less hassle.

Sorry but I had a hard time rolling this out after being in the frig.Doubled this for my Lemon Pies and prebaked them. This shrunk into the pie plate. I did something wrong I am sure because of all the rave review. May try again.

I don't know how I feel about this one.  I made this crust for a Sweet Potato Pecan Pie (also on this site) and it came out chewy instead of flaky.  It was still very tasty, but not quite the texture I was looking for - could have been that I handled it too much, could have been the filling.  I didn't chill it for the whole time recommended, but didn't have any trouble rolling it out - once cool, it was easy to roll on a little waxed paper sprinkled with flour (I do live in the desert, so  humidity's not really a problem for me). I added a bit of nutmeg and ground clove to the mix and that was delicious.  I made enough for two pies and only used half, so I will try it again in a week or so and see what I come up with.

We rolled out the scraps, cut into wedges, sprinkled generously with cinnamon sugar & baked on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes. Delicious!

This is the only crust I use.  The only change I make is to add another stick of butter (more is better school of thinking), and it is great!  Even without the extra stick, this is a great crust!

Awesome! This is the frist time I tried to make a pie crust. I used this to top off 2 cobblers and everyone was raving about how flaky it was. I chopped up the butter frozen and then stuck it back in the freezer to get cold again. (In AZ everything melts fast.) :-) It worked perfectly! Thank you for such a simple and tasty solution!

So good, you could eat it uncooked. I made an apple pie with this crust and it turned out perfectly.  Easy to make (I used my little food processor to cut the butter and flour together) and absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I love this pie crust! I don't have a pastry cutter, so after cutting the butter into small cubes, I just mixed and pinched with my fingers, leaving defined chunks of butter, which turned out fine.  Also, I only refridgerated it for two hours, but that worked out ok too--the crust was nice and flaky, and the butter definitely gives it a nice flavor over some of the other shortening recipes.

I have found my standard pie crust! THANK YOU! This is a great recipe to have on hand for a great yummy crust. I followed suit with the other "raters" and only chilled for 1 hr the first time, and it turned out great. I grew increasing impatient, and only chilled for 30 minutes the next time. It was a bit harder to roll out, and it didn't get as flaky... I will certainly plan on at least 1 hr chill time in the future.

I didn't really care for this crust. It held together well but wasn't flaky. I only tried this because i was out of shortening and was really hoping for a flakier crust. Sorry, but I won't make this again.
