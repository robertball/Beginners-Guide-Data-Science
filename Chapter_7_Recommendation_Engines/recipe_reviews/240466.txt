I prepared this as the recipe directed, with the addition that I poured in a good glug of white wine to help the cooking process along.  It did do that, but it added great flavor as well. Also, not wanting big slivers of garlic, I chose to mince it. This was a nice, but still easy, way to dress green beans up a bit without obliterating their good fresh flavor.

These were very good, but I think would be even better with some bacon added.  The shallots and garlic cooked quickly, and even the green beans were "crisp tender" in about 6 minutes.  Thanks, murphyjct, for sharing your recipe!

Fantastic! I didn't have enough green beans, so I added a red bell pepper  cut into long slices. I used 2 shallots, extra butter, & 2 big pours of chardonnay (poured one towards the end). Also, didn't have parmesan so used Asiago/Reggiano instead. AMAZING.

I used Trader Joe's frozen french-style green beans and steamed them five mins before proceeding with the recipe. Added them to the "sauce" once it was done just long enough to wilt and heat them again. They were delicious! Followed reviewers' advice and used one TBSP each butter and EVOO.

This recipe is good problem is that it has too much oil. I will add less of both or just butter. To make sure my green beans were cooked well I added a bit of water to create steam to steam them while they cooked.

I thought these tasted good. They were just a little oily for my taste. I followed the recipe but used about 20 oz of green beans and cut the parmesan back by half. It seemed like plenty grated parmesan after 1/4 cup. I will probably stick to an oven roasted recipe I found on the site that doesnt require all the stirring and oily splatter from a stove-top pan while cooking. I did find, too, that they do taste better the next day after some of the oil is absorbed. ty

Absolutely delicious way to dress up Harcott Green Beans. Onion and shallot became carmelized as the green beans cooked! Yum!

I cut the recipe to 2 people.  But followed the recipe ingredients.  It took the beans so long to cook the garlic got over cooked.  Flavor was ok.  Thanks for the inspiration.

Delicious!  I DID use haricot vert, as my husband doesn't care for regular green beans.  Just delicious!  I will make these again and again!  

*HINT*  Cook the beans LESS if you enjoy some crunch to your veg.  SO much better, IMO.

We liked these! I followed the recipe to a "t", and they were really good. I served these next to grilled tenderloins and roasted sweet potatoes.

I made only a couple of changes.  I blanched the beans first for 4 minutes .  I agree with another reviewer that there was too much oil, so I will decrease that a bit next time.  Otherwise, these were perfectly delicious.

Very good green bean recipe, even using frozen green beans and green onions for shallot. I am sure it would be even better with the right ingredients. I added about 1/3 cup of water to help  the green beans  cook through and prevents the garlic/onion from burning. Next time,I might cut the fat to only 1 tblesp butter and 1 tblesp olive oil. the extra fat wasn't needed, with all the flavor from the garlic and the Parmesan cheese.

Theses were the  juiciest and most tender pork chops I have ever made.  I used eggbeaters and had buttermilk on hand that I wanted to use up.  I also added some roasted  walnut crumbs that I added to the Italian breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese I used.  Good bye Shake n Bake!
