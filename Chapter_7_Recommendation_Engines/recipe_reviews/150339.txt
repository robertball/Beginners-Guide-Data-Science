I know this as "Sunday Chicken" and it's great! I always serve it with pap and a crunchy salad. I use a whole cut-up chicken (throw in 2-4 extra pieces if we have company) instead of just the wings and there's definitely enough sauce.

Has a good flavor, but WAY too much water in this recipe.  Perhaps there should be only 1/2 cup?  I'll be trying it again but with limited water, and covering it in the oven.  Might be better in the crockpot..?

i have done this recipe many times, and always find it delicious. the only issue i have is that where i live, there is nowhere to get dry onion soup mix, so i use french onion soup instead which works just as well, and also peach chutney which i switched for apricot chutney. apart from that, kept everything the same.

This was a simple recipe with a great flavor - though I agree with another reviewer who noted that there seemed to be too much water.  I will try with a whole cut-up chicken and less water next time.
