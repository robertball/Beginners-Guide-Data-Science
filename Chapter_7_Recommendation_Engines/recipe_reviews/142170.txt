I am always looking for a different recipe for veal and this is an excellent dish.  I made it for just my husband and myself, but I would definitely serve this to company.  The lemon cream sauce is delicious - I made a rice pilaf that soaked up the sauce and with fresh broccoli, and a glass of crisp white wine we had ourselves a feast!  Thank you for this great veal dish.

Excellent. This is just a beautiful recipe that made for a beautiful dish and an outstanding meal. While I also make this with veal, in this case I used turkey cutlets, a darn convincing subtitute for pricier veal, both in appearance and taste. I floured the cutlets before dipping them in the egg and the bread crumbs. I made my own crumbs, just seasoning them with my favorite Tuscan seasoning blend. These cook in just a couple of minutes per side, so watch carefully! Once they're brown, they're done! The sauce is rich, and velvety smooth, with the flavors of the wine, chicken broth and cream blending masterfully into this simple but absolutely delicious sauce. I did add some fresh minced garlic right after removing the meat from the pan, and cut back on the lemon juice - but that's just my preference as I wanted a more subtle lemon flavor than I knew I'd get with the amount called for. I served this with "Pastachutta," also from this site.  I couldn't be more impressed.

This review is for the sauce only, which I served over pasta. In Italy last June I ate a delicious lemon cream pasta, and I've been wanting to know how to do it without curdling the cream. This recipe is pretty darn close, and will be exactly what I was looking for with some adjustments next time I make it. Thank you!

The sauce by itself was very tart but when paired with the veal it worked very well. Next time I would use a sweeter wine as this may have contributed to the tartness of the sauce.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I followed it pretty much to a T, except that I didn't use the wine-didn't have any, and I used a little less than a quarter cup lemon juice b/c of not using the wine-i didnt want the lemon to be overpowering. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream to cut back a little on fat and calories!  My husband loved this as well.  Served it with roasted red potatoes and asparagus.  Wonderful!

I tried this over egg noodles, with fresh broccoli. Great recipe, only I substituted light cream for heavy, for thinner sauce, but a bit lower in fat. Really enjoyed this and simple to prepare. A glass of Sauvignon Blanc complimented the meal nicely.

One of the better recipes I've tried from this site.  I served it over whole wheat spaghetti and it even satisfied my mother-in-law, who is not easy to please!  I made one modification to the recipe:  Instead of using garlic and lemon pepper, I used 1/2 teaspoon of cracked black pepper and added 2 minced cloves of garlic and the zest of 1 lemon.  It makes the flavors really pop!

Very good.  I used pork tenderloin instead of veal.  Sliced and tenderized.  I also used panko breadcrumbs instead of italian.  I cut back on the lemon juice a little since a lot of people said the lemon was too strong but I could have used the whole amount.  I only used about 1/2 the cream b/c as I was adding it, it just seemed like it was going to be too much.  But, I think if you followed the recipe exactly, it would still be great.  These were just my changes based on what I had and personal preference.  The sauce was a little thinner then I expected so I might add more cornstarch next time.

Very easy recipe.  This was my first time making a veal dish and it tasted amazing.  I removed both of the pepper items because I am allergic.  Used 2 bullion cubes and 2 cups of water instead of the can of broth.  I added 4 large cloves of garlic and substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream to reduce the fat & calories.  Overall this veal had a great taste to it and the sauce was perfect over linguini or any other wide noodle or pasta.

I made this recipe tonight and my husband and I loved it.  My husband said it was restaurant quality.  I did not have garlic pepper so I just sprinkled some garlic powder and pepper into the sauce (just eye balled it).  Only thing I could say negative is that perhaps it could use a little more cornstarch.  Sauce was not thick but rather runny.  But that being said it was fabulous.  Next time I'll try a little more cornstarch to thicken it a little more.  Would be great to serve to company.  Served with baked potato and spaghetti squash.

The amount of lemon was too much for me.  I could barely eat it, even after trying to lean it out.

Lite and flavorful.  I added garlic to the oil prior to adding wet ingredients.  I would serve the sauce on the side to allow those who are more calorie conscience to determine the right amount of sauce for themselves.   Wonderful weekday meal with spark.

This is absolutely delicious!! I have also made it with chicken tenders and I just keep them warm in the oven until ready to serve. This recipe is company-worthy. Sometimes I omit the wine and it still comes out great. I happen to like Progresso's Panko Italian bread crumbs and they work beautifully with this recipe. Thank you so much!!!

I have made just the lemon cream sauce a couple of times to put on chicken and it is great.  It makes a lot of sauce so I always cut in 1/2 for me and my husband.

The first time I made this recipe,I followed it exactly and have not found any reason to change much of anything. The only thing I do differently is add some steamed vegetables to the sauce prior to serving: asparagus, broccoli, or whole green beans. This has turned out to be my husband's favorite recipe and if he could have it for every meal, he would. As it stands, I make it minimally every 2 weeks!

Excellent dish!  I returned the veal to the pan with the sauce after it thickend up then turned the heat down low, covered it and kept it on low for 30 minutes.  My husband said he like to have it again within 10 days!

I just loved this recipe! I had to make some minor substitutions as I lacked a few ingredients, but it didn't alter the recipe too much.
First I dipped the veal in flour, then egg then a mixture of panko and plain bread crumbs, which I seasoned with Italian herbs.
I sauteed some sliced crimini mushrooms after browning the meat and added them to the sauce.
For the sauce, I added a scant 1/2 tsp lemon zest and minced garlic with pepper as I had no lemon or garlic pepper. (I had altered the recipe for serving 1 person).
I used chicken base and water instead of canned broth.
I had 1/2 and 1/2 instead of full fat cream. 
This sauce would be wonderful over chicken, for sure!

This is my new favorite recipe from this site - and that is saying a lot.  It reminds me of a dish I get at our local Italian Restaurant.  Since I'm not a huge Veal fan, I used Chicken Breasts, which I pounded very thin.  I added about 1/2 tsp. of Lemon Zest, as well as parsley at the very end.  I served over Angel Hair Pasta and the reviews from the family were over-the-top.

I'm rating this based on the lemon cream sauce itself, since I used it with some Chicken Florentine.  It wasn't bad...it was just way too lemony, and I like lemon!  I would cut the lemon juice at least in half.  That said, once I got used to the flavor, it was decent, and I finished my plate.  Still, it needs some adjustment, in my opinion.

I thought this was good. Next time I will add a little more cornstarch (so the sauce is a bit thicker) and use less wine so that it's more lemon-y than wine-y.

This was excellent.  I have had my fair share of veal with lemon cream sauce and this is the first time I have made it at home. I used milk instead of heavy cream and served it with spaghetti.  I also added capers to the sauce. It was fantastic and hubby loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.  I especially loved how quickly this meal came together as I teach all day.

This was ABSOLUTELY amazing. I made it last night for my husband and I, and boy did he ever enjoy this. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect. I also made some spegetti and poured the sauce over the spegetti and yum yum yum!!! I wouldnt change a single thing. Super easy to make and the flavour is to die for. My husband wouldnt stop talking about it (made me feel special)

This was FABULOUS!  And, I forgot the cream.  I didn't realize the omission until I was enjoying the dish.  I can't wait to try it with the cream.

This recipe was very good. I liked the tartness of the sauce. The recipe as it stands makes a lot of sauce and it isn't very thick. Next time I might try thickening it a bit more and only making a half recipe of the sauce. All in all a good recipe and quick to prepare after work for supper.

The sauce was rich and thick although it was a bit too lemony for me and my husband.  One thing I changed was the meat I used chicken.  It was so moist and tender.

Not bad, but I personally think its a little to much work for a veal scaloppini. Could be just that I did a sub-par cooking job, or bad prep.

Thanks though!

This is one of the BEST Veal Scaloppini with Lemon Cream Sauce EVER!  The Lemon Cream Sauce is so delectable and enhances the veal taste.  I did add a few capers on top of the sauce. 

DELICIOUS!!!

I like it but my husband not so much but I guess you really need to like lemons. I did thicken the sauce a little more because it’s really thin. Now this is a true lemony sauce so hopefully you really like lemon. :-()

Very lemony. Would deres lemon juice to no more than 2T. next time. Used half and half to cut back on fat. Paired well with multi grain brown rice and white asparagus

I used while milk instead of heavy cream.  My sauce didn't really thicken as much as I expected; but I'd adjusted quantities of some of the ingredients and probably wasn't consistent so it's likely my error.  It was quite tasty nevertheless and I will repeat.

I love this recipe! The veal is delicious and the sauce is simple and yummy. I have used the sauce recipe several times over chicken and pasta as well and it never disappoints.

We thought this was delicious. The only change I made (out of necessity) was to swap in pre-breaded veal steaks, since it was all my grocery store had. I loved the strong lemon flavor - it paired really well with cheese ravioli. All this and dinner was on the table in twenty minutes! Oh, and I bet this would be just as delicious with pork or chicken to make it more budget friendly!

Amazing! New favorite!! The sauce is absolutely magical, thankyou for an incredible recipe!

I did make a change - after egg and breading the veal, I fried it on max heat just til the breading was golden brown - I did the pieces in batches - and covered with foil and 2 thick tea towels.  It was still raw inside. Left it for 15 or so mins while I finished off everything else to go with dinner and voila! Perfectly cooked all the way through from it's residual heat withoyt becoming dry, as this cut can do. 

I noticed a couple of comments saying the lemon was too strong - I did find it powerful to the taste + BUT, after eating the meal (and I pigged out - couldn't stop on this one), I realized, its not the lemon - its the combination of lemon and white wine - there is a lovely sour taste to the sauce - but if you're not used to cooking with strong (but beautifully balanced) flavours, you may be surprised. If you can't handle the strength of the flavour, I'd be far more inclined to leave the lemon juice as it is in the recipe and replace the wine with water or stock.

This was one of my all time favorites from AllRecipes. Super!  I made it a little lighter by using fat free half and half and I agree with everyone a little too lemony so I added a 1Tbs each of sundried pesto and regular Basil Pesto just to tone it down a bit. I cooked the veal with cheese tortellini and put the sauce over all. My husband just raved about how good it was!

I skipped the lemon pepper and used lemon zest and freshly cracked pepper.  Super fast, and really yummy.  It's a keeper.

Easiest enough for me to teach my 17 yr-old son who has been cooking for just 6 mths.  We loved it. Only modification I made were those suggested by "bsgerry in her review dated May 2011".  Like her, I used 2 cloves of garlic and rather than lemon pepper, I used lemon zest from one lemon and 1/2t of black pepper.  Next time I may add 1/4t of red pepper flakes..it's a risk but I think it might give it a deeper dimension.  Thank you for offering the recipe and the ideas.

I have now made this recipe for family and friends several times and it is always a big hit. THE sauce is DELICIOUS. I only put half a cup of cream, and i don't use bread crumbs, instead i flour the veal. this is an amazing, and easy recipe

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish, but was short a couple of ingredients, so did some substitutions.  Instead of putting veal in a skillet, I put it in a casserole dish with a little butter & thinly sliced garlic @ 425 F.  Used cornflakes instead of bread crumbs for coating and lemon white rum instead of white wine (the wine would have been better, though).  Also sliced some mushroom & chopped fresh cilantro and cooked in skillet with olive oil before adding lemon juice, etc.  Family loved it.

This was fantastic. The lemon cream sauce was a very tart and I knew there was no way I was going to convince my children to eat it that way so I threw in 1/8 of a cup of sugar, it was still tart but it really took the edge off. 2 out of 3 kids wanted to dip everything they had on thier plate in it. Both my boys when back for 3rds and my 3 yr old daughter not only ate all her meat (no small feat) but asked for seconds.

This is  a delicious dish after making a few personal alterations. I personally don't like my veal crumbed so i left it nude (as it where)but the lemon sauce toppped it beautifully and made it restaurant quality. Next time i make this though i shall pound the veal though just to make it a littlemore tender.
