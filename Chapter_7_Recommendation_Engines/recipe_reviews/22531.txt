While I am new to cooking I found this recipe easy and it tastes great. Use about 1/2 the almond paste and don't have the pan too hot when you cook the breasts. I will make this again.

Such a good boneless chicken recipe.  A nice different touch.  I had to substitute flour and almond extract for the almond paste, still turned out very tasty.

I combine this recipe with the amaretto chicken also on the site.  i follow this recipe to step 3.  then i use i cup heavy cream, 1 cup shredded gruyere cheese, and 1/2 a cup of amaretto and melt on the stove top.  then i pour this sauce over the chicken and put in oven at 350 for 40 minutes.  i serve it with linguine.

I made this for Valentines day dinner for my new BF 3 years ago. It got Rave reviews; and were still together :o) Since I was traveling to dinner I chopped everything up ( onion, almonds, butter pieces) and put in containers and cooked the chicken and did the mixing at the house. But It was really Easy and WONDERFUL. It was just as wonderful a few days later for lunch. May be too flavorful or "wierd looking for kids"

A very good chicken dish.  I used a lot less almond paste than the recipe called for and it came out wonderfully with a light flavor.  Was a pleasure to make and enjoy with my husband who like it as well. A good recipe.

At first I gave this recipe a 3 because it was bland, overly rich and the nutmeg was too strong. But the next day the leftovers were so delicious that I had to change the rating to a 4. To sear the breasts so they are juicy, I used peanut oil with 2 tbspns butter to keep the flavor. I constantly nudged the pieces so the almond crumbs didn't fall off, and cooked on high for 2 minutes each side. The butter/oil mix from recipe will just burn on high heat. The egg wash was really watery, I used 1/4 cup water with 2 eggs, I added 3 or 4 big coves of garlic and some salt to the mushroom/onion mix. I highly recommend adding dry red wine or liquor to the cream sauce, as well as 1/4 tspn salt. The grit of the chopped almonds bothered me, so next time I'd try putting some almond extract in the egg wash, lightly flour the breasts, then top the dish with toasted almond slivers upon serving. I served with chopped cauliflower and carrots sauteed in olive oil and garlic. My husband gives this recipe a 5.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  After baking the sauce was a grayish color and didn't give the dish enough flavor.  If I try this recipe again I will try making it without baking the sauce with the chicken.

Very good dinner - had to make my own almond paste, but still an easy recipe!  Make sure you're hungry because it's filling!

This recipe took me much longer than the 40 mins that the recipe describes.  It was very difficult to coat the chicken in the almond crumbs and then brown the chicken without the crumbs falling off and then burning black in the pan.  I probably won't ever cook this again.  Once it was done, however, it was quite tasty.

I was quite dissapointed! The almond coating did tend to burn and I did the chicken in two batches to avoid the scorched taste. But the BIGGEST problem is the almond paste, which has a sweet taste. It totally ruined the whole dish. It should definitely be omitted. The onions, mushrooms, chicken and cream were great, but I will never make this again with the almond paste. Also, it might taste just as good to dredge the chicken in flour, and just add some toasted almonds to the dish before baking.

I love almonds, however I didn't care for the taste of this recipe at all.  The almond taste (I think because of the paste) was far too strong.  I wouldn't make this again.

Had high hopes but was disappointed. Chicken was dry, sauce needs other spices to balance the almond, and really, two cups of almonds was waaaay too much-complete overkill. Tried to improve it with some spices, but needs serious adjustments.

Ok, not great, a little too much chopped almonds, should have something more to coat than just the almonds

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It requires a lot of prep.  I agree that it was difficult to get the almonds to stick.  A good deal of the almonds were left in the pan to burn while cooking the onions and mushrooms.  The chicken came out looking a very unappetizing gray color and was very dry.  I cooked in the oven for 40 min. as indicated.  Maybe I cooked to long in the pan.  There was very little sauce even though I doubled it and it was very sweet and didn't go well with pasta.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Truly delicious, my husband loved it!  I did not have almond paste on hand so instead I used almond butter which gave the sauce a heavier, creamier consistency.  Next time, if I opt to use the almond butter I will use half and half instead of the heavy cream to make a lighter sauce.  I did not find the preparation of the recipe at all difficult and contrary to comments from a couple of other reviewers, I had no problems with the almond crumbs adhering to the chicken nor did I experience any burning or charring of the almonds.  I will certainly prepare this recipe again!

I agree that the almond paste was just too much. I didnt use onions because I am not an onion fan and I think they ruin everything they touch but the chicken and mushrooms were great with the cream. If I make this again I will not use almond paste. Maybe a bit of almond extract would work.

This was a very nice, different chicken dish. I did some "health-ing" up with the recipe, and it turned out fine: only used butter (no oil) to brown chicken; used light cream instead of heavy cream. I also omitted mushrooms and onions, but that's only because I forgot to buy them this week. I think the mushrooms would have been a nice touch; maybe not the onions so much. 

Some tips: 
--Process/blend almond paste before adding to pan. It will melt faster and more evenly into the cream mixture. 
--Cover your baking dish with foil before baking; I didn't, and some of the cream sauce ended up browning and sticking to the dish, making it very hard to clean. Or, you could line the dish with foil before putting in chicken. 
--I don't see a huge need to brown the chicken before putting it in the oven. The heat from the oven browned the almond crust better than the butter, so you will still get the same appearance if you skip the frying in butter step.

I served this with cinnamon vanilla mashed sweet potatoes, which were the perfect compliment to the almond flavor of the chicken.

I made this dish for my wife and we loved it.  The only variation was I did not include the paste as this was a meal I decided to try last minute.  I cooked the chicken for approx. 25 minutes due to the breast size.  The chicken was juicy and had a nice taste with the blend of mushroom, onions, almonds and the cream sauce. We both enjoyed this dish very much and will make it again.

This was steller. I usually find chicken breasts to be bland, but when prepared with this recipe they are delicious. I used fresh green beans cut in half lengthwise instead of onions because I didn't have any onions. It added a nice texture to the dish and some pretty color. I also didn't add any water to the egg and as a result I didn't have any trouble getting the almonds to stick. I didn't use almond paste in the cream topping either. I just prepared the cream with spices as directed and added a little flour to thicken it. I had some trepidations about pouring this on top of the chicken/mushroom/greenbean portion, but it turned out delicious and I'm glad I did. I highly reccomend this yummy dish!
