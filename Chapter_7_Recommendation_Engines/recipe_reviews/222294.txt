I made this side dish tonight to have with broiled Tilapia.  I was so glad I did...it was easy to make and tasted very good.  Because I'm the first person to rate this recipe, I had no other reviewers suggestions to go on...so I made it exactly as directed.  I usually look over other reviews and decide from the start what I'm going to add or delete to the recipe.  Maybe that's not always a good plan as I prepared this one as directed and it was perfect!  I enjoyed knowing there were so many fresh veggies in this, and because of that, it tasted so fresh and healthy.  I plan to make this one over and over again and save it to My Recipes.  The next time I plan to sprinkle some toasted cashews on top just before serving to take it over the top.  Thanks BramptonMommyof2!

This was so tasty, the only thing I did different was that I sauteed the kale with the other vegetables instead of steaming it separately.  Perfect side dish to incorporate veggies for kids.

My wife and I have wanted to make Kale for awhile now to see if we would like it. So I found this recipe and WOW, we love it! So easy to make and so much flavor. Every component marries together so well. I sliced everything REALLY thin so that it almost disappears while sauteing but the flavor is there. I just added chicken breast to the dish and it was fantastic. I highly recommend this to everyone!

We loved this recipe, but I did change a couple of things. Since I really wanted a kale recipe, I thought 1 cup would not be enough, so I chopped 4 cups. It cooked down to about 1 cup, so perhaps that was what the author intended. It did not taste strongly of "greens", so it wasn't too much. 
The other things I changed was to use cooked brown rice instead of white. And since I had no mushrooms, I omitted them. The result was a hearty, flavorful side dish that went beautifully with grilled mahi mahi and asparagus for dinner. 
I served the Sauteed Rice with Kale with a choice of soy sauce or Parmesan Cheese.

I was looking for something I could prep ahead of time for weeknight company. I chopped all of my veggies and cooked the rice the night before, and cubed and sauteed 2 chicken breasts with some garlic salt and pepper. The day of, it was just a matter of cooking the veggies and throwing in the chicken and rice long enough to heat through. Very easy and quite delicious. This would be fabulous with tilapia.

I never cooked/ate kale before,I made it tonight and added some soy sauce.
It was great, but I wonder how can I make it less dry.

Very tasty,and healthy. I omitted the mushrooms the first time I made it (had none). The second time, I made it with mushrooms. I think it tasted better without the mushrooms. So I made it a third time with more kale (to substitute for the loss of mushrooms. The reasult was the best of the three. 

Well, at least in my opinion.... =)

This is great! I had leftover rice that I needed to use and a bunch of kale and this was perfect! I love the hint of heat from the cayenne! I didn't have mustard powder so I used a little prepared dijon and it was still good!

Loved it! I had kale in my refrigerator b/c of my son-in law and I wanted to try it. 
I was a little afraid, but the reviews for this recipe gave me courage. 
We did not have one morsel left. We served it with soy sauce (not everyone used it) 
and this helped for those who thought I could have gone a little lighter on the 
cayenne pepper. 

I used canned mushrooms, small peppers, 2 sweet onion, 2 cloves of garlic, celery, and steamed my kale in the microwave. I only had about 3/4 Cup of rice in the fridge so we went with that and added some left over turkey to make it a meal. My fears about the strong taste of kale were unfounded. 
Yummy.. Yummy. 
I would definitely make this again.

I have been wanting to try kale but wanted to do so with flavors I already know I like. This was super delicious, and made the house smell good. I wish I took a picture to post because mine looked more heavily weighted with vegetables versus rice (I'll do it next time). I also may try this with brown rice (the downfall to that is that it takes longer too cook). I would definitely make this for guests and/or a pot luck. The only thing is I would say is it's not quite 6 servings (maybe if served 1/2 cup - or less - each), but my husband, daughter and I ate it all at dinner.

i've made this recipe several times now.  I absolutely love it and is a big hit in our house.  The first time I made this, I followed the directions to a "T".  Since then, I have altered a few things.  
I made this for a side dish this evening and I added more Kale.  Instead of 2 cloves of garlic I used a whole bulb of it since I love garlic and it never seems to be too much.  I didn't have mushrooms or green peppers although I had the little sweet peppers and I used approximately 20 of them since I had a good bit on hand.  I also added another stalk of celery. I felt that one stalk wasn't enough. 

Thank You BramptonMommyof2 for submitting this recipe!!!

Great recipe... though I halved the rice, altering the rice to veggie ratio. I also and used brown rice. I will make this again since I love kale, and yet am getting tired of preparing kale in the same old ways. This one is a keeper.

I thought this was very good. I omitted the  mushrooms and green pepper but cooked everything else according to directions. I will use this again.  The reason you want to steam the kale is so it will not be as bitter.

Will definitely make again. Didn’t have onion; subbed shallot. Added a salsa pepper, seeds removed. Left out mushrooms to please DD. Added dash of smoked paprika to spice mix. Cooked kale directly in pan with other vegetables. Held garlic out, dropped it in for last minute of cooking before adding rice. Next time I’m adding the mushrooms and DD can pick them out. Versatile recipe—spices and veggies can be changed up easily.

Really liked this. Made in the middle of a blizzard so had to make due with what was on hand. The beauty of it was it worked and hubby and daughter loved it! Daughter took a doggy bag home next day after snow stopped-she and hubby divided the leftovers evenly :) Some necessary changes for my situation...doubled the recipe (thank goodness!) used canned mushrooms instead of fresh (SQUEEZE THEM DRY TO AVOID EXCESS MOISTURE), brown rice instead of white, kale and green peppers were home grown and frozen, no cayenne so I used a dash or two of hot sauce. This is one for the keeper box for sure!

I used quinoa because I did not have enough rice and put in extra kale as some others suggested.  It turned out great!  My husband commented that the dish tasted like it had wasabi in it.  I assume it was because of the dried mustard.  :)

I tried the recipe for dinner tonight.  It was awesome.  I made a few minor adjustments.  I added a little curry powder, chopped chicken breasts and chicken broth so that is was not so dry.  I used brown rice in the place of white rice. It was delicious and filling.  I will definitely be making again.

Love, love, love this dish. Perfect for anyone exploring more meatless options because it‘ chuck full of vegetables. Made a number of substitutions, though. Used brown rice instead of white rice and cooked the rice with vegetable broth. Used red peppers instead of green to give it more color, and added a touch of cayenne pepper in addition to the dried mustard for flavor at the end. I shared this with my vegan friends because all they have to do to make it vegan is to eliminate the butter.

I also sautéed the kale instead of steaming it but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Delicious!! A little on the spicy side but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it!

Great as a side dish, or even as a vegan lunch. I stuck to the recipe for the most part, but I only had frozen kale and no celery, green pepper, etc. I sauteed the onions, garlic and thawed kale, and steamed the white rice separately. After everything was done, I scooped the cooked veggies atop the one cup of the rice and enjoyed the meal. Also, the current spices listed is a bit bland. I added some Tabasco sauce, Jamaican curry powder, MSG-free seasoning salt and a couple of bay leaves. I'm half Liberian and half Southern. I want my food to have flavor, girl!

Very tasty way to get your veggies!  I doubled the recipe and it was enough to feed 8-10 as a good size side dish.  I actually used two boil in bags of brown rice which is more than double the rice but we liked it.  I cooked the kale with the other veggies in a large deep pan instead of steaming it.  I put a lid on it for the first 5 minutes until the kale reduced, making it easier to mix the veggies.  We also added a little extra cayenne and slivered almonds.
