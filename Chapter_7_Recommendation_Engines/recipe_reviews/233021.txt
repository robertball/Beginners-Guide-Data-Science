Quick and tasty but I did put a spin on this. I made it as a stir fry. Added mushrooms, more garlic and some soy sauce and ginger to give this an asian twist. Thanks for the quick recipe!

I thought this recipe was simple enough but it lacked depth of flavor. Definitely needs salt ( and I generally cook saltless) 

Like the others I upped the garlic and also added onion powder, plus thinly sliced Roma tomatoes at the end.

Maybe a bit of lemon juice would brighten up the flavors.

This was good. I added extra garlic. Minced and powdered. Also added extra cheese. Very light on flavor, but that is okay! I would make this again.

Worth the 4 stars just for the ease factor alone. This is a great basic recipe and you can pay around with whatever flavors you want. I added cayenne and curry powder and it gave it a great international flavor. I also added red, yellow and orange red bell peppers when it came time for the veggies. The timings on this recipe were also spot on. 6 mins for chicken was perfect and juicy and my vegetables were not soggy at all. I used fresh zucchini, not pre packaged. Would def make again!

Very good, my husband really liked it. I added some Italian seasoning and used fresh zucchini, but I like the idea of adding mushrooms.

This went over well. I used fresh zucchini and,since my partner always wants some kind of sauce or gravy, I made garlic alfredo sauce on the side.

This recipe is quick and easy, but it is a little bit bland. I added salt and pepper, and I served it over a bed of herbed pasta, which really added dimension to the dish. The flavor of the Recipe Ready zucchini was good, but I'm not sure how much of a time saver it was.

I really enjoyed this receipe. After looking over the reviews I too made some modifications. I cooked cube chicken thighs with fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, salt and  Goya perfect seasoning. Once cooked, I transferred into a bowl.  In the same pan,  I cooked mushrooms, zucchini, yellow zucchini, onion, more fresh garlic and  fresh rosemary. I cooked until tender then I put the cooked chicken back in. Lastly, let in simmered them I added some Parmesan cheese. It was so good, had a rich flavor and simple to make.

It was pretty good.  Very basic.  I think it's a good starting point - we will probably add more veggies.

This was really quick and easy!  So easy that when I did things out of order it still tasted great. It has a lot of room to play with the recipe. My only additions were some smoked paprika and green onions. Served with some Parmesan cous cous was perfect!

Delicious, and healthy! A few modifications that I found helpful. First, I used fresh zucchini, stir-frying until just undercooked, about 4 minutes. Next, I blanched the chicken pieces before I fried them, adding the zucchini without the extra tablespoon, which I used stir frying the zucchini. Finally, I added crushed red pepper to taste, before serving. Excellent dish, and quite easy to make.

Quick and easy! Great dinner for those nights we're rushing home after soccer practice and don't have a lot of time during the week. Some notes: I used two fresh zucchinis instead of frozen ones, added an extra clove of garlic (3 total), and also added some Asian veggie seasoning I had on hand to the chicken (in addition to salt and pepper). I served it with steamed white rice, as the recipe suggests. It was amazing and we had no leftovers. It's rare to find something that pleases the entire family! Next time (because there will definitely be a next time!), I'm going to add some fresh sliced mushrooms. You could add just about any veggies you want to this recipe and be fine. It's a great, basic recipe. Love it!

The only things I added was yellow squash and Mrs. Dash for chicken. Gave it lots of flavor without the salt. I used fresh veggies instead of frozen. So I cooked it all in one dish. It was delicious. I will make it again soon!

This was OK.  I would add more to it next time. I did add salt and pepper, and some leftover asparagus I had cooked the other day. I served it with rice and orzo cooked in chicken broth.

My expectations were not high, I just needed a quick dinner. For the most part I followed the directions, but used fresh zucchini and added mushrooms. After reading the reviews I added more salt than I would have. I think a key is not over cooking the chicken. Will make this again.

This recipe was great! I used fresh zucchini so it took me a little longer to prep & cook (until the zucchini were tender) and I added a little extra parmigiana. It's was pretty darn good!

Bonus points for being fast and healthy ( even with fresh zucchini, dinner was ready in no time), but it needed something. Next time, I'll add more seasoning.

I used olive oil and tossed the chicken in bread crumbs before cooking.  Then used fresh zucchini slices cooked in more olive oil, added some garlic, salt and pepper.  Flavor was good but overall the dish was very oily.  Will attempt more of a stir fry next time and/or steam the veggies.

Great recipe but don't be afraid to add on to it.  I made it but used fresh zucchini and also served with a homemade tomato sauce. My whole family enjoyed it.  It's a good base/starter recipe for add-ons.

Very good!!  I used fresh zucchini, broccoli, red bell pepper onion and grape tomatoes.  Used salt and pepper to season and garlic.  Made the dish a lot more lighter of a meal.  Great decision. You have to try it.  I went a little heavy on the garlic but you dont really taste it. But definitely brightens the meal up with the different colors.  Perfect summer dish.

This was so quick and easy. We're vegan, so I used Beyond Meat in place of the chicken, and vegan parmesan. This came together in a snap and is healthy and tastes good. Leftovers taste great cold after sitting in the fridge overnight.

This turned out really good. I used Recipe Ready Garlic and Onions instead of just garlic and added plenty of cracked rainbow pepper and salt

One word:  Delicious.  My daughter, who balks at cooked vegetables, couldn't stop eating it.  I did add a pinch of salt to the recipe, but other than that, I prepared it exactly as suggested.  I will definitely be making it again!
