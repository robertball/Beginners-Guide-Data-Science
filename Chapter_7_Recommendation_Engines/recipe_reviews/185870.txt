Because buckwheat is a very strong flavor, it needs strong spices.  The flavor of this cake grows on you; at first I didn't care for it, but then I couldn't resist it!  I ran out of cornstarch, so made up the difference with flour, and it turned out fine!  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't exactly have all the ingredients for this recipe, but even with substitution of maple syrup for molasses, 1/2 cup of whole cornflour+baking powder, five spice in place of all spice, and the additon of orange peel this recipe was forgiving enough to work even with the changes

Great cake! The batter seemed very thin to me but it baked up perfectly. Spices were perfect. I also paired it with cream cheese frosting; cutting the cake in half to make two layers. It made a pretty, bar shaped cake. Sweetie loved it!!!

Fantastic recipe!  So quick to make, so moist, and so convenient in terms of having ingredients on hand.  I didn't have buckwheat flour, but I did have wheat flour, and it turned out to be so yummy.  I made this in a tube pan, and it was a great breakfast cake to have with coffee on my husband's birthday.

I would give this 4 stars, but it earned an extra one for being such a hit with my husband and son! I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan and it was moist and had great flavor even though I didn't have any vanilla.

A definite winner. The cake was so moist and delicious - all without the saturated fat of butter, eggs, and shortening.

This cake was a great way to incorporate buckwheat flour into our diet.  My only substitution was honey for molasses.

This is a very different cake, and fantastic!  I bring it to potlucks and gatherings and it is always a hit as it is a good change from sinful overly sugary deserts.  It is a desert for "men"! 
I have buckwheat on hand, and throw it in the vitamix to make flour.  Easy easy to make! Keep some whipped cream on hand to help those who need extra sweetness.

Due to gluten free needs, I made a few modifications, but it turned out great. My picky 12 yr old dd loved it, so I know it's good! Even the gluten eaters at our family gathering loved it. Here's my changes:

Substitute flax meal for all purpose flour, used part sucanat and part white sugar, next time I will use all sucanat to make it a bit healthier. I also left out the pepper, just didn't sound good to me. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 40 minutes, then frosted with a cream cheese frosting. Very moist and delicious. Texture is a bit different than normal spice cake, the ground flax is not as fine as regular flour. This will be my go-to spice cake recipe, thanks so much! I also love that it is egg-free, I can make it for people with egg allergies. By using the ground flax, I can also avoid nut allergies as many gluten free buckwheat cake recipes call for almond meal. Thank you thank you thank you!

Wonderful bread! I was able to make it GLUTEN FREE by just substituting with a GF all purpose flour. In my oven it only took 30 minutes to cook. Will absolutely be making it again!

The flavor was very good (I love the strong buckwheat taste....the batter was amazing). The texture was different, but that is to be expected. Not sure if I will make this again. If I do I will add a cream cheese frosting.

We loved it.    My  older daughter asked me to make it again.    Buckwheat pancake "mix" was used instead of buckwheat flour (because I didn't have the latter), and I didn't have any white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar.  I increased the molasses slightly (because I like that flavor) and I added an egg.   I'm sure that I would have liked this recipe without my revisions; I just thought I'd mention that the cake turns out great using these items.     I will definitely make it again.

The cake was good, but for some reason mine ended up REALLY crumbly. Too crumbly to frost for sure, or even really to cut into pieces. I was going to give it three stars, but then I left it out overnight. It got hard, crumbly, and useless as cake...so I added some 3 eggs, 1 cup milk, and a handful of old raisins to, baked it for 30 minutes at 350, topped it with some freshly whipped real cream, and had the MOST DELICIOUS spiced bread pudding I've ever had! So I seriously may use this recipe just for that purpose next time. (But if anyone knows how to get it less crumbly, please post!)

Very easy to make, very good to eat.  The texture of this cake is a bit odd-- it somehow manages to be both moist and crumbly (due to the lack of gluten in the buckwheat flour?)-- but that didn't worry us too much, and the amounts of spices and molasses are exactly right.  I'm pretty sure we'll be making this again, and just for fun, I think that next time I'll try adding more black pepper and dry mustard!

Great flavor! I topped ours with freshly made applesauce.  I have made wacky chocolate cake before many years ago but this version is superior. I have to eat wheat-free so I was glad someone posted in comments below they used corn flour. This is so good. I will make this on a regular basis. I grated lemon peel in the batter. I milled my own flour. I found the batter to be very thick so I added extra water turned out fine. I used millet flour, buckwheat, and cornstarch. Next time will try rice or corn in place of millet.

My family lives this cake! It is very adaptable to what I have on hand.  Today was all self rising flour and omitting baking soda. I used brown sugar instead of molasses, and I only had red wine vinegar.  It still came out wonderful.

We were surprised how good this cake came out since it doesn't have milk or eggs. But best part was to see auntie enjoy two pieces of cake without any problems (she has severe Crohns disease and can't handle dairy or too much gluten). Thanks!
