Absolutely a fabulous way to eat corn! I added garlic and a bit of cayenne for extra kick. Had a bit left over and found out it makes a wicked good spread for garlic bread!

I just used a regular salt and added some cayenne pepper. I was unable to find hot salt butter so I am assuming using cayenne would be pretty similar. Anyway, very delicious. The adults liked it better than the kids.
