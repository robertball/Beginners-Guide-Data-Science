Thanks Bibi, this was great!  So versatile, too.  I added potatoes but this would be good with any number of veggies- corn, green beans, whatever.  I did add some extra spices but that speaks more to the jar of marinara than the recipe!  I did end up adding 2 extra cups of broth to make up for the broth absorbed by the pasta but that was the only significant change I made.  The family loved it!

oh my goodness, this soup is so flavorful! I substituted fresh spinach--2 handfuls--for  the kale. Next time will make with fresh garden herbs, but it was so good even with store-bought dried Italian  seasoning.  Yummy!
