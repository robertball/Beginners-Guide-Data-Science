My husband enjoyed this dish more than I. The flavor was ok but I thought it was missing something. I put a dash of cumin in my serving and it really brought the flavors together for me. It was super quick and easy and I will probably make it again for that reason alone.

This was a very basic dish one that doesn't get better as a leftover dinner the next day. On the second day I added some black beans and corn and it seemed to add some interest and more flavor. If I were to make it again (almost every dish deserves a second chance) I would not slice up the corn tortillas and mix them with the chicken. I would toast the corn tortillas separately and serve them on the side. They get a little mushy and disappear when mixed all together. Serve it with white rice for a color contrast on your plate.

Love this recipe so fast and easy. Store did not have diced tomatoes with green chilies. Bought them separately and added them in. Turned out a little mild for the family so the next time I added a can of diced Jalapeños and the family raves about it and has become a favorite. I also bought a rotisarie chicken on shopping day came home and took it off the bone and was then ready for a quick dinner that night. I have also topped it off with sour cream added chips and salsa on the side.

We followed the recipe directions exactly. It was missing a little "oomph." I think next time I'd put in taco seasoning or some chili powder. I don't mean it wasn't spicy enough because my kids don't do spicy. It's possible the tomato sauce watered down the "oomph" of the enchilada sauce. Maybe cut out one jar of tomato sauce and put in an extra one of enchilada sauce.

I didn't like this though the flavor is 4 stars. The problem I had was it was just a pan of mush. To me this would be better to serve inside a flour tortilla instead of putting tortillas in it ( I don't like corn tortillas at all so I tried flour tortillas.) The texture is terrible but the flavor is awesome. Try it as a filler instead of as an all-in-one dish. Also canned chicken can work for this dish if you want to save some time but regular chicken is gonna be much better. I'm making this one again with the changes I mentioned.

I forgot to mention that I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning before sautéing it. Great flavor. Not bland at all

This was really great! I was expecting it to be fairly plain because it was less steps than traditional enchiladas. Even my picky child asked for seconds. Only change was I added cumin salt and pepper to the chicken in step 1. This is definitely a new family favorite.

This was just as fast and easy as I had hoped! It was really good as well. I did add some minced onion garlic powder cumin and cilantro that i happened to have on hand. I added more cilantro and sour cream to top it off. (although im not sure it needed the extras) My husband liked it as well he said it does taste just like full on enchiladas! but for me so much easier and faster for a weeknight dinner. Thanks for a great addition to my recipes. Just had the leftovers for lunch and it was still great!

I made this recipe for a potluck and it was a hit. I used a grocery store rotisserie chicken which I added taco seasoning and it was perfect.

A favorite with my family and pot lucks! I shred the chicken (using the trick with a hand mixer) for better texture.

This is just as good as traditional enchiladas that take a lot more time! I added corn just because I had some leftover that I needed to use and served guacamole and sour cream on the side.

Used what I had in the house so substituted the corn tortillas with some chips and used salsa instead of tomato sauce. Came out tasty. Loved that it was so quick to assemble and you only used one pan/skillet!

Because so many others suggested it needed a bit more of a "kick" I cooked the chicken in a little butter and olive oil seasoned with a bit of cumin cayenne pepper paprika onion powder garlic powder salt and pepper. When the chicken finished cooking I removed it from the pan added a touch more butter and sautéed half an onion. Add the shredded chicken back to the pan and continued with the recipe as written. I used a "hot" enchilada sauce and did not end up adding the tomato sauce as I thought it was saucy enough for our taste. My husband and I both enjoyed it as a very quick and tasty meal. Leftovers reheated very well in the microwave. Will likely make again.

Thanks!! I have made this recipe several times! Easy and a great way to use leftover chicken. I use the red enchilada sauce on this site.

I made this in about 10 minutes flat for a quick dinner one week night to rave reviews. I did add cumin onion flakes and some minced garlic. So easy quick and great! I've told at least 6 people about this recipe since. And we don't really even love enchilada's! Will make again and again!

I would make it again Really yummy but silly me I don't enjoy spicy food. Instead of rotel (next time) I would use mild salsa. Also the tortilla's taste like pasta. I bet you can substitute the tortilla for any type of pasta. Hope this helps!!

This dish is alright. The cut up corn tortillas made the dish taste bland. The highlight are the enchilada sauce and tomato/chili mix which adds a pop of flavor. I used ground beef rather than chicken adding 1 garlic clove minced salt and pepper while browning. I also added 1 cup of frozen kernel corn to add some much needed texture to this dish. Leaving out the tortillas I think this would make a good dip or topping for a taco-like salad.

A little soggy but delish. I also used plain diced tomatoes because we don't like a ton of heat. It still had some heat though.

I sauteed some sweet onion into pan then added the chicken and corn tortillas. For the tomato sauce I uses diced tomatoes mixed with half a can of green chilis and half a can of tomato paste along with the enchilada sauce. I mixed copped chives in with the chicken and tomatoes. Once the cooking process had finished I put on the remaining grated cheddar along with generous supply of chopped fresh celantro. delicious.

I made this dish the other night exactly as the recipe is written. Mine came a mushy tasteless mess. There definitely wasn't enough liquid and I only had 10 tortillas. I had to add another can of Rotel and a can of cream of chicken soup. I added some chili powder and cayenne pepper to add some flavor. We also served it over tortilla chips to add some crunch. I really wouldn't call this a "meal". It seems more like a dip or maybe something you could use as filling for a real enchilada with some sauce and cheese on top. Hmmm.....may I will try again and just revamp it some. It was very easy to make.

Amazing! My hungry husband got fed in minutes and he had 2 helpings. I might even get taken out for ice cream tonight, as a reward! I used Jasmine rice and had to increase the water to 2 cups of water. But really, a wonderful dish!!

Good without putting the tortilla in the skillet. Put mixture into tortilla's afterwards and baked a few min with red sauce and cheese.

Hubby loves it and I liked it more because of the fact that it s so easy to make. I did make a Few changes... I used well drained canned chicken which was easily shredded. Used white corn tortillas that held up well. Used 2x cheese. Threw in a little cumin and 1/4 cup medium to hot salsa we brought home from a restaurant visit earlier in week. Threw some restaurant tortilla chips on side for scooping. So easy and good on a cold Midwestern night.

After reading other reviews concerning this dish being mushy I made a few changes. I used 2 cans enchilada sauce 1 can Rotelle tomatoes and 1 package of enchilada seasoning mix. Mixed my shredded chicken with tomatoes and enchilada sauce adding the seasoning mix. After bubbly I sprinkled cheese on top. Then I put my torn corn tortillas on top and sprinkled rest of cheese. Put the lid on pan and turned it back on just until cheese on top melted. Served with sliced black olives sliced avocado sour cream and black bean and corn salsa. Yummy!!

Just like many of the other reviews I agreed that this is a great recipe foundation but as is it is quite bland. I made it a four star recipe by cooking the chicken in olive oil with garlic salt pepper and some reduced sodium taco seasoning. I omitted the tortillas from the skillet and served them crispy on the side for crunch. I added corn black beans and cumin while it cooked. I used a small can of diced Chile's and half a can of diced tomatoes and omitted the tomato sauce entirely as the finished product had plenty of sauce without it. Overall it was qite good and my husband really enjoyed it.
