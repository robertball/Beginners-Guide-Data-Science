Things I did.. I marinated my garbanzo beans in some garam masala overnight.  This adds depth to the dish.  
I sauteed the onion in canola oil, added ginger then (1) 28oz can of chopped tomatoes. Cooked thoroughly. Added beans and used an immersion blender to puree a little bit.  I then added (1) 14oz can of lite coconut milk.  Cooked a little further. Tasted it to check to see if it needed anything.  I added a couple more shakes of garam masala.  Simmered on the stove for another 10 minutes.  Served over rice.  Only giving it 3 stars b/c as written I think it needs some tweaking. Possibly 4 stars with my tweaking. Thanks for sharing !

really, really good and very easy to prepare. I used ground cumin instead, adding after cooking the onions 5 minutes, and also added 8 0z. of yogurt at the end, cooking maybe 5 minutes.

This was very good, though I did make some modifications to it:  I tried to roast the cumin seeds as directed, but I didn't have much luck with that, so I ended up scooping them out of the pan and using cumin powder instead.  After I followed the recipe, I didn't like the flavor too much (I felt I could still taste the "canned" flavor of the chickpeas), so I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and some more cumin and curry.  I'll admit that the first night it was... ok.  The second day, it was better, and the third day, WOW, it was great.  I really loved the texture that came from putting the tomatoes and onions in the blender.  I wasn't sure it would be worth the effort, but it actually gave the sauce a nice smoothness that I really enjoyed.  I will definitely try it again (with no changes) and see how it goes!

This was delicious and exactly what I was looking for!  I used ingredients that I had on hand- like a 14 oz. can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic for the tomatoes, ground cumin and ginger and regular all purpose flour.  It was simply delicious over jasmine rice and economical too.  I will definitely be making this often.

My husband is not a fan of vegetarian so I added ground beef. I did not have cumin seeds, rice flour or garbanzo beans. I substituted cumin powder, white flour, and navy beans.  It turned out a little bland but it hit the spot! I will be making it again.

LOVED this!   I pretty much made it as the recipe calls, except I didn't have cumin seeds or fresh ginger (but I am pleased with the taste I got from the powdered substitutes). I also really like cilantro, so I at least doubled the amount. And because I had some chicken, I threw some of that in there, too. I will TOTALLY be making this again!

Another hit.  Used a dry pre-mix of curry spices and canned diced tomatoes.  I'm convinced that the curry mix makes it.  Also used tapioca flour instead of rice and 1/2 inch of ginger.  Not as tomato-y as I'm used too but that'll be fixed next time with addition of tomato paste.

i was having a lazy day, looking for something easy and found that i had all the ingredients for this already.  Instead of blending things, I just threw everything in the skillet together so it came out chunkier and less sauce-like. since my spices have been in the cabinet for years, i decided to try 3 tsp of cumin seeds and 3 tsp of the curry powder.  I had an extra tomato I wanted to get rid of so I threw it in on top of the other 2.  It looked a little dry so I added a splash of water.  not exactly like you get in a restaurant, but the flavor is perfect, and this recipe was just what i needed to get a general idea of how to make the dish.  i served it over orzo since rice takes forever to cook.  hallelujah for quick, easy, lazy-day recipes!

This was pretty good, but needed more flavor. I plan on adding tumeric and a Basil leaf while it simmers next time. I will make it again though!

Absolutely delicious. I added more curry than it called for an also added some potatoes and omited the flour and added a bit of the potato water for thickening. I served it over rice. Husband approved.

My husband found this recipe trying to find uses for an abundance of chick peas (owns a commercial kitchen and someone over-ordered).  We made this last night and it was delicious!  We didn't have rice flour, so used 1T. regular white flour and he doubled the curry powder as someone else posted. Served it over brown rice.  We will be making this again. Great vegetarian dinner. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is good!  I'd had channa masala at an Indian restaurant recently and wanted to try making it. Very simple and tasty, though it seemed a little bland to me at first so I doubled the curry powder at the end. It was lovely after that.

I had to make some changes, I found it bland as written. I used the cumin seeds as stated but ended up adding cumin powder and double the curry powder. I also cooked longer so that the chick peas "absorbed" some of the flavor rather than just be "swimming" in a flavorful sauce. I had to add water (about 1/4 cup) because it was very dry. Will probably make again, with the changes.

Eh, I liked this one not so much.  No one in the family really cared for it.  It wasn't bad, just kinda odd and not real tasty.  We love garbanzos and have made Chana before, this one just didn't have that Indian restaurant taste to it.

I didn't blend the onions and tomatoes and I used canned diced tomatoes (not the juice just the tomatoes) and I skipped the flour all together.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of garam masala and I skipped the cilantro.  Easy, simple and quick recipe to prepare.

Made this dish for my family (5 adults, 2 kids, 1 toddler) and doubled the recipe.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it so well that it really wasn't enough.  If you're in to spicy Indian food you'll have to add it because this is quite mild.  When asking around if everyone liked it I got a "yes", but the true test was from my brother.  He has been to India and apparently it still has a bit to go in order to truly taste like the real thing, although he still gobbled it down without any complaint.  Cooking and prep time is very reasonable and with a bit of hunting I was able to find all ingredients in my local Publix grocery store.

Excellent & easy to prepare. I like to use dried garbanzo beans, soak them overnight & boil for 1 hour.  The curry powder can make a big difference. I used the House of Spices curry powder which contains coriander, red chilies, cumin, pepper, and fenugreek. Tastes better & is healthier than most restaurants! Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce - it seemed to lack body, and I'm not partial to raw onions.  I ended up sauteing the mixture for about 15 more minutes (adding some water to further cook the onions and later flour to re-thicken the sauce), upping the spice quantities, and adding a touch of mild to give the sauce more body.  (I should also note that I'm living and cooking in Spain, where some conventional ingredients aren't too common.  This may have influenced the recipe's success.)

This was VERY good.  I made more or less the same as instructed, except I used cumin powder instead of seed and didn't blend together into a paste (it was good chunky!).  Make sure to add the cilantro as a garnish, it definitely adds flavor to the dish.

It was a little bland initially (I'm Indian) and I made the following revisions: added 2 tbsp garam masala, 1 tsp cumin powder (or you can add extra seeds), an additional tbsp of olive oil, and 2 thai green chillies split down the middle with seeds.  It was pretty yummy after that and the flavors do develop with time as someone else noted.

I found this recipe lacking a lot of body. Basically it was fine, but the flavors were very flat and I couldnt get a nice robust flavor you usually find in indian food. Not sure what would have made it better? I tried adding a few spices but I still couldnt make it work. In the end it was quite edible but not something that had the family screaming for seconds.

I made this with pinto beans because I had them on hand.  I love the way the flavors combined, especially with the ginger!  I can't wait to try this with other beans!  This is a wonderful recipe!

Great taste and quick and easy to make.  It's a keeper!  I found that I needed to simmer (covered) for about 10-15 extra minutes to further soften the chickpeas and meld/thicken the sauce.  The extra time really brought out the seasonings.  Prior to that is was very tomato-y .... and not that rich tomato flavor, but a thin, fresh tomato flavor.  Otherwise did everything exactly as the recipe stated.  So good--just like my local Indian food buffet!

Thank you, thank you for this recipe! Lovely mild flavor. All three grandkids ate it, even my picky eight-year-old. Into my files it goes!

we added 2 more teaspoons of the curry.  Even still I found that it was not a vibrant flavour.

One of my all time favs. Made it for my vegetarian boyfriend and he loved it. I added some garam masala for extra spice. The sauce being an all vegetable purée really adds that fresh taste to this dish. This is definitely one of my go-to recipes.

I made it as stated, except I cooked the onions until lightly caramelized. Also, I added a bit of garam masala seasoning when it was done and cooked for another five minutes. I like the spices to be rather strong.

Love this dish!!! This was my first Indian dish and I enjoyed it so much I've began to cook other Indian dishes as well! So flavorful, yet simple.

Had this dish at an Indian restaurant in downtown DC and was determined to duplicate it.  This recipe did not disappoint.  It's easy and delicious!

Very, very good. I am a huge fan of chickpeas, so this recipe was a must-try. My only modification to this recipe was that I added about 1 tbsp. of curry powder because I used two beastly large tomatoes and found that the curry flavour was lost in the meal. also, this recipe seems to freeze very well, so it's a great make-ahead!

I made this exactly as the recipe says.  The only thing I changed was to use white flour rather than rice flour.  The flavor was good, but kind of bland.  I'm hoping it gets better tomorrow (as another reviewer has mentioned).  Paired with garlic naan, it made for a good dinner, but I don't know that I'll make it again.
