I thought this recipe was pretty good. I felt like it could have used a bit more sweetness and cinnamon so next time I will add a 1/2 mashed ripe banana and a bit more cinnamon. Overall I liked that this was healthy and used whole wheat flour. I ended up using whole einkorn flour and whole khorasan flour and it turned out moist and fluffy.

I cut this recipe to 4 servings and got 8 muffins.  I used bread flour in place of the kamut flour since that is supposed to be a good sub according to sources on the Internet, and I left out the cardamom.  When I tasted the batter, I added some salt because it seemed lacking.  I was surprised that there was no baking soda added since I'm used to that when using buttermilk; I do realize that the baking powder was upped probably to cover that.  I wanted more sweetness--not a lot, but some.  They definitely need the crumble on top that was mentioned in the cook's notes.

I liked the overall healthy aspect of a baked good or muffin. The flavor is closer to a 3 or just okay. This muffin really lacked sweetness and I typically find most desserts and baked goods too rich or sweet. I also used Reynolds baking cups and they stuck to them. I never had that issue before. I made 1/2 recipe, which still resulted in 12 muffins.
