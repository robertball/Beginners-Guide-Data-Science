Pretty good.  I think it needs more seasoning, I added Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese before serving.  Not bad for a change of pace.

The flavor was not bad, but not great for the time to cook.  Reheated well, but will not cook again.

This did not come out like I expected it was pretty much veggies with pasta, not like a marinara at all. I dont think I would make this again
