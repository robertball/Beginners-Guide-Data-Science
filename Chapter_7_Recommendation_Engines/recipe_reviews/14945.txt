These were awesome! I used 8 oz cream cheese instead of the mayo and they turned out great! I agree, these are even a crowd pleaser for those who don't care for spinach! I wrapped them in aluminm foil and refridgerated for 1 hour, then used a serated knife to slice. Wipe off the knife frequently - they turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe Lisa! Tracy

Very good!  I had a lot of inquires as to how to make this appetizer.  After reading the reviews, I too made a few modifications.  I used cream cheese and sour cream and a package of Knorr's vegetable soup mix instead of the ranch mix.  I also added waterchestnuts and omitted the onion.  I only used one package of spinach and found that was plenty.

I've been making these for years...instead of regular onions I chop up 4-5 green onions.  I also let them sit overnight so the flavors "set" and cut them with a serrated knife to keep it from getting messy.  Everyone I know loves these, including my 4 year old!!!

My family and guests found this recipe terribly bland. Next time I make them I will add a layer of chopped or sliced prosciutto (strong-flavoured, salty Italian cured ham) to liven them up. Also, I will probably use less spinanch and use herbed cream cheese instead of some of the mayo, along with a combination of green and white onions. Any other additions that could 'brighten' these up also couldn't hurt.

This was a very tasty and easy appetizer.  I used cream cheese instead of the sour cream to make them less messy.  I can think of ways to adapt this recipe while still using the same basic concept:  goat cheese/cream cheese mixture, pesto, and sundried tomatoes come to mind.

Wonderful!!!  This was a great idea with a great taste.  I love spinach dip but am bored with serving it in a bread bowl or with crackers.  Wrapped in a tortilla and cut into bite size pieces made this appetizer fly off the dish with people begging for more.  This will definitely be a repeat on our party menus!!

Absolutely delicious. Had to make something quick to take to a cookout and found this. The only thing I changed was that I used real bacon. Had no problem with it at all. Very thick and delicious. I thought the flavor was perfect. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! Will be making again and again!

Soooo good!!  A little messy to make, but totally worth it.  I used the cream cheese instead of Mayo (hate to see how messy it would have been with mayo)  Everyone raved about them, and my girlfriend tried to get me to make them for her wedding reception!  A MUST try!!

I keep making these for every event that I need to bring an appetizer and they're always a huge hit!  I do not substitute anything...if you chill them for the suggested amount of time then you should have no problems slicing!

These were a huge hit at my party!  I stuck to the recipe, except I added 1/4 cup of sun dried tomatoes and used basil and sun dried tomato flavored tortillas.  The key was squeezing all the water out of the frozen spinach so that the wraps were nice and firm.  Everyone raved!

These were great.  I doubled the amount of bacon bits because I had extra bacon left but still couldn't taste a strong bacon flavor but it was still good.  I've read other reviews where viewers suggested chesnuts for an extra cruch and I may try that next time just for fun.

These were a hit!!  I am giving this 5 stars only with the changes I made based on other reviews.  I used cream cheese(not mayo), only needed 1 box of spinach, used green onions and real bacon for the bits.  Another changed was using the Hidden Ranch FIESTA mix (I think this was the key).  After mixing everything it sat in the fridge for about 24 hours before assembly.  I then heated each tortilla up in a pan..after all mix was gone (only used 7 tortillas .. but this was plenty) I placed them in the frezer for a couple of hours before slicing.  I think another key is to get ALL the water out of the defrosted spinach ... this required a good half roll of paper towels.  These will be made again and soon!!!!

I'm giving this party favorite 5 stars with my own revisions.  I used cream cheese, instead of mayo.  I also added 4 chopped hard boiled eggs and Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix for the spread.  I used thinly sliced turkey, fresh spinach (with the stems trimmed off) and shredded mild cheddar cheese.  Next time I may try a tomato basil wrap and water chesnuts.  I've been asked to bring these roll-ups over and over again.

I substituted the sour cream with nonfat plain yogurt and replaced the mayo with fat-free cream cheese.  Very yummy and light!

Wonderful!  I did not have the veggie tortillas as shown in the picture so used plain. Personal preference would be the veggie torts as they are thinner.  I had just made the Ranch Dressing #2 from this site so used it instead.  As another cook stated, she used  water chestnuts and I think that would taste wonderful as well.

I would reduce the amount of ranch dressing mix next time, the dip was really strong. They were quite messy too, but looked nice on a red plate at christmas, I used green (spinach) soft tortillas.

I made these over the holidays. I made up double batch of the rolls and just cut them up as I went to each function (there were three spread out over three days).  Everyone raved about them.  I couldn't figure out why.  They are delicious, but so easy to make that I felt silly taking so many compliments for them.  One aunt asked if I could make them EVERY year.  A definite winner.

After reading some of the other reviews I spiced ours up a bit. I used a fiesta ranch packet and added some shredded cheddar cheese to this batch. I also only used one 12 oz package of spinach becasue that is what I had on hand.  These were delicious but would have thought they might be a little bland without the changes I made.

Very good as is.  I also experimented with adding a layer of prosciutto or thinly sliced chicken and wrapping it around a blanched asparagus.  Really yummy!

I have been asked to bring this to ever function I go to since I made it last year for a Memorial Day party. I even have MEN ask me to bring this to our parties. I do change just a few things like add a little more green onion and a whole bag of real bacon bits. Do freeze for a few hours to make easy cutting and I cut at a slight angle rather than pin wheel style as the seem to cut a litle better.

This recipe is really easy and fast, easy to transport too! I used finely chopped green onions in place of reg. white onions though. Everyone loved them and wants the recipe. I would also mention to just spread the mixture to about 1/2" of the finished edge of the tortilla, as it will spread out as its rolled up.

I was in a big hurry so I cheated and used store bought spinach dip heat and serve bacon, and I just sprinkled it with some ranch powder for some extra zing. These flew off the plate at the baby shower, and people could not believe how easy they were to make.

These were pretty good. I added grated carrots, used cream cheese and a dallop of sour cream, and only used 1/2 of the package of ranch. They were somewhat soggy, even after sitting in the fridge all day, but that might be because I used too much of the spread on each tortilla.

With a couple of alterations this came out awesome. I used fresh bacon and fresh baby spinach. There wasn't any sour cream on the island that i live on so i just used cream cheese. It was REALLY good I took them to a party and everyone loved them. Make sure you cool them for at least the hour because if this isn't cold it doesn't taste good Oh and i also put some chopped up tomatoes in them and it came out just as good.

I have made these for some years, and they are always gone quickly. Adding a can of water chestnuts that you have chopped finely adds a nice crunch to them.

These are great...basically it's spinach dip without having to dip.  I changed the recipe a little though so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Used cream cheese because I felt the mayo/sour cream would be too runny to roll up.  Also used real bacon cooked well done and crumbled...I don't like bacon bits.  I also used green onion instead of regular onion, about 2 stalks.  Yum!

I found this recipe last, and it's now the only appetizer folks ask me to bring. It's a hit with everyone! The only change that I make is in the amount of the ranch dressing mix. I do not add all of it. When combining everything, I add a little ranch dressing and taste it it. And then, add more, if needed. Also, give it the required time to chill. The first time I made it, I was in a rush, but take your time and it will be a hit for you , also!

I started making this on Saturday afternoon with the intention of finishing up the next day as suggested. Well I put it in the fridge, and it didn't come out until Tuesday (I was very busy). Nonetheless, I rolled it up in the tortillas, sliced it up, and YUMMM! My whole family enjoyed this recipe. It's pretty rich so you can't eat too much at once. But it is very good in moderation. I will definately make this again.

These were excellent.  I added cream cheese, halved the mayo and the sour cream and used knorr vegetable soup mix instead of ranch dressing.  Everything else I left the same as recipe called for.  Once chilled I had no problem cutting them.  They make a large quanity so they are great for parties or large gatherings.  Thanks fo the recipe.  :-)

Delicious!  I used real bacon, about 4-5 slices, instead of bacon bits.  And added shredded cheese, just because I love cheese!  These were very simple to make and made quite a few, which is always a plus when you are making for a large group.

I tried these with the cream cheese instead of mayo.  They sounded delicious (I love spinach dip), but I didn't care for them.  Had lots leftover from a party and neither my husband or I wanted them (and he will eat just about anything).  Ended up pitching them.

Excellent.  My changes were substituting the cream cheese for mayo, adding a little cheddar cheese (mixed types or sharp) and olives.  Most people devour them once I put them out, and anyone who helps me cut them eat up the extra pieces that does not make it on the serving plate.  Great appetizer for taking to potlucks, and is perfect for the many vegetarians.

I have been making these for a couple of years now, always a hit everywhere I've taken them or anytime I've served them. My husband and I have modified this original recipe over the past couple of years. We omit the sour cream and use cream cheese instead; it makes them thicker. We also add shredded cheddar cheese and we use fiesta ranch mix. I don't use regular flour wraps either, I use spinach and tomato wraps. These are full of color, taste great and always disappear! Even all the kids will eat them.

Really good!  I made changes to suit my tastes along the lines of other reviewers.  I used cream cheese instead of mayo, I used Knor vegetable soup mix instead of ranch dressing mix, I used real bacon bits and I used spinach tortillas.  I am certain that I would have liked the regular version as well.

I would give this a 5 even though I have not tried cause it sounds wonderful, but you know what I was thinking, put a slice of lox or salmon on it also. Thank you for this wonderful website. Deb

I tweaked the recipe by substituting Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix, cream cheese, and jicama.  The recipe was good, but wished I added slices of turkey & ham.

These are such an easy thing to bring to a gathering.  I was able to make them the day before and just grab my dish the day of the shower and go!  They were very good and seemed to be liked by adults and kids.

This turned out well. I didn't want to use mayo so I subbed cream cheese and used bottled ranch dressing instead of the powder mix. Yummy! Had some red pepper I wanted to use up so I diced that up and used red onion. I had some bacon from another recipe so I used that in place of the bacon bits. If you don't have frozen spinach like I didn't, I subbed fresh baby spinach with no problem. I chopped the heck out of it though!! Great recipe.

I just made this recipe for the second time. I halved the recipe so I used 1 bag of spinach, a 3/4 bar of lite cream cheese, 1/2 cup of lite mayo, one spoon full of lite sour cream, and one small white onion. I also separated the batches and added red cabbage to one and bacon bits to the other. I think it is nice to have a vegetarian option. The cabbage added a lot of color and has bite to it. Last time I added grated carrot but it was a bit too bland. I was able to get 3 good size tortilla rolls out of this amount.

I have made these a couple of times and have always gotten compliments. Fairly easy to make and tastes delicious. If you have time, let the filling sit in fridge for a few hours for flavors to blend.

I loved these and so did my husband.  I used spinach wraps instead of tortillas and they worked perfectly.  I also used 8 oz. cream cheese instead of mayonaise and also used real bacon and green onion.  I made these early in the morning, rolled them in plastic wrap and refridgerated until that evening when I sliced with a serrated knife.  They were not at all soggy.  Will definitely make these again.

These were SUPER easy and yummy! As per other's suggestions, I used light cream cheese instead of the mayo and sour cream. I also used real bacon and green onions. After chilling for about 3 hours they were really easy to cut and everyone really liked them.

I have been making these for years and they are always a hit. My recipe is slightly different: 1 (10 oz.) package of frozen chopped spinach - make sure it is well drained, 1 cup mayo, 8 oz. of sour cream, 3 oz. jar bacon bits and 9 (10 inch) flour tortillas. After rolling them, wrap in plastic wrap, then refridgerate for 4 to 6 hours. Take off plastic wrap, cut in 1/2 inch slices and serve. DELICIOUS!!!

Don't see how this would work (i.e., how the rolls would set) with mayo,  so I subsitituted cream cheese and it was tasty!  I also used turkey cold cuts and didn't add the bacon.  Good stuff!!!

I used sundried tomato & herb flavored tortillas but found this recipe a bit bland, roll-up didn't cut well, i wouldn't make these again.  However, I took them to a party and they went quick!

I thought these were pretty good, but no one at my party ate them.  They did not cut very easily and looked kind of sloppy.  I've had better.

Great recipe!  I used 8 oz. cream cheese instead of mayo, too, and they were great.  I also used light ingredients, which were fine, as well.  I doubled the bacon and used the flavored tortillas...SO yummy and easy!

My husband took these to a pot luck at work and they were a big hit. I made a double batch and there wasn't one left! I did use cream cheese instead of the mayo just to make sure they held up. I'll certainly being bringing these along to the next get together.

My mom has been making these for years to rave reviews. A couple of things we've learned over the years: 1.) drain and squeeze the spinach to remove as much water as possible before adding it to the mix 2.) use green onion, chopped fine 3.) store whole wraps in the fridge until you're ready to slice. 4.) they taste best at room temperature

These were really good!  Took them to a get-together and had several people comment on how tasty they were and ask for the recipe.  I highly recommend using cream cheese in place of some of the mayo or sour cream.  I also used green onion which seems to go really well in these type of roll-up appetizers.  I'll definitely be making these again.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent.  I didn't have frozen spinach, so I used fresh, that I had on hand.  I chopped up approximately 2 cups of fresh and added that to the mixture.  I also took the recommendations of others and used cream cheese in place of the mayo and they were excellent.  I rolled them up in tin foil to put in the fridge to set.

I added a few things to this recipe. First of all I used "Spinach flour tortillas" but there are many flavors to choose from other than just flour. I added one small can of waterchestnuts chopped small, Italian seasoning about 3 tablespoons and pepper to taste. I put it all together in a bowl and let it sit for a day. Then I put it onto the tortillas, it took only 6 tortillas not 10 but it worked out well as 6 only came in one container. I used a spatula and worked the mix to slightly before the edge rolled tight then wrapped in clear-plastic wrap. It makes it easier to transport if you are taking to another location.

These were okay for an appetizer to take to a party.  People ate them, but no one really raved about them being good.  I thought they were somewhat bland and boring.

These were okay... I made enough for one tortilla according to the recipe, but I didn't like it so I altered the mix for the remaining tortillas by omitting bacon bits, adding cashews, putting in more onions and adding smoked salmon.

These are really good! I followed the recipe exactly. I made them for (the adults) my 7 year old Birhtday's Party. Everyone loved them, even my husband that is not a big fan of spinach! I had none left to take home for snacking on later.

I thought that this recipe was a bit to salty however this might be because I used only one box of spinach instead of two. I saw that some only used the one box. Probably would of turned out great if I would of used two.

This was a hit at a recent pool party!! Kids and adults were gobling them up, I needed way more. I too changed the recipe to 8 oz cream cheese, a couple of big tablespoons of mayo and sour cream.  I also put a lot more green onion(5-6 stalks)and definetly only 1/2 of the ranch packet.Next time I will also add some green chiles.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I can only assume this was a hit since I had no left-overs.  I decided to try a variation that was posted in another review and I used sour cream and cream cheese instead of mayo.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

Great potluck appetizer. Used real bacon (chopped into bits)and cream cheese (instead of mayo). For an extra "kick" I added salsa over the top of the spread before rolling up. It was definitely not lacking in flavor. Used decorative toothpicks to serve at a pool party. Very good recipe!

I used fat-free mayonaise but I think i am going to use cream cheese next time so they can cut easier. People raved and they were so easy to make. The only problem I had was rationing the filling for all 10 tortillas. I only used 9. Plus I had to keep cleaning the knife when I cut them.

I loved this idea but I changed the recipe to suit my original spinach dip recipe. I swapped the ranch for vegetable soup mix(way better flavor), I omitted the bacon so it could be meatless, I added in chopped water chestnuts for crunch, green onions, mayonnaise and cream cheese instead of sour cream. So versatile to modify to your preferences. My only hang up is that it makes the tortilla a little soggy so they are best to roll up day of.

Loved it & so did everyone else.  I did change it a little though. I added a package of dry vegetable soup mix to the recipe. I used that for another recipe & I liked the flavour so I opted to use that in this too.  It was a hit.  Yum !!!

I made this exact recipe after seeing it on here. It was delicious! It took less than 30mins because it didn't involve a great deal of prep work. It is mostly just mixing the ingredients together and since I do not usually cook and am not really fond of cooking this was a perfect quick snack/appetizer dish I could make in no time. My mom also took them to church and they were a hit! I can't wait to make them again!

Replaced most of the mayo with cream cheese. Used homemade ranch mix (1 Tbs dried parsley, 1 tsp dill, 1.5 tsp onion powder, 1.5 tsp minced onion, .5 tsp garlic powder, salt, pepper). Replaced bacon bits with prociutto slices. Used generous green onions. Enough for 8-10 tortillas.

This was very good, even for my 9 year old son who doesn't think he likes spinach. I think I can put the roll up in his school lunch and he'd never know. I do recommend refrigerating it before cutting

I've made a few changes to be a little more healthy. I used PLAIN Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. 3/4 c mayonnaise, 1 1/4 c Greek yogurt. No bacon. It came out great!

These are amazing! I used Greek cream cheese in place of mayo because my toddler has an egg allergy. I used the Allrecipes "dry ranch mix" for the ranch mix, and left out the bacon because my family is vegetarian. For my toddler and husband, I added Tofurkey and regular tomatoes. They absolutely loved them. Mine didn't have Tofurkey or tomatoes because I'm allergic but mine were also incredible! Thanks for the recipe!

Good, but like other reviewers shared it lacks some flavor. I thought the dry ranch mix added too much sodium. It's time consuming if you don't pre-thaw the spinach. As a reminder, the spinach needs to be squeezed thoroughly to get the water out.

Instead of the mayonnaise, I used the suggestion of garden vegetable cream cheese (8 oz.).  I also used the suggestion of fiesta ranch packet.  Draining the spinach is a MUST!  Instead of the tablespoons of onion, I used one white small,diced onion.  After spreading the mixture on each tortilla and rolling, I put them in a gallon ziplock bag and froze them for 2 hours.  They are much easier to slice and it cuts down on time.  Refrigerate after slicing.  Taste great cold! They were devoured! :)

I have been making these for years. Originally my contribution to the office "pot luck".  Always a big hit.  The flavor is addictive.  I us green onions (scallions) and add a dash or two of tabasco sauce.  Gives it a nice kick, and I refrigerate them over nite. also I cut them with a pair of scissors. Works great and doesn't squish the tortilla.  A repeat crowd pleaser.

To make lighter, I have substituted plain yogurt for the mayo and is un noticeable.  I have also  used cream cheese instead of mayo.

I used cream cheese instead of mayo and halved the ranch dressing mix. I made them as wraps instead of little pinwheels so I didn't need to cut them, but if you do, use a sharp knife and wait til they're chilled. They were pretty tasty and next time I'm going to try them with flavoured tortillas.

The tortillas became soggy - I would decrease the amount of 'wet ingredients' next time.  I would recommend cutting them into slices immediately after rolling.  They seemed to chill better and hold their shape.

Definitely will make again, but use real bacon pieces (couldn't taste the bits at all)and less of the Fiesta Ranch seasoning mix as it was very salty and had to compensate by adding more sour cream.

This was very tasty, but a little difficult to assemble and cut.  I took others advice and substituted cream cheese in place of 1/2 of the mayo called for in the recipe and my mixture was still too soft when I went to cut  the rolls.  Although it was a little messy to make the flavor was very yummy and made up for it, so I would probably make it again.  I changed the recipe a little too and added a smidge of garlic salt to pep up the flavor, 2 tbsp of chopped water chestnuts for a little extra crunch and used Knorr vegetable soup/dip mix instead of Ranch.

This was good, but I made my own modifications based on previous reviews: I used 8 oz cream cheese instead of mayonnaise, only used one package of spinach, and left out the bacon bits.  I had some garlic and herb tortillas so I used those instead of plain, and I only used 5 tortillas (12 inch).  That seemed like enough.  The filling didn't spread all the way to the ends so they had to be eaten first.  I'll make this again.

The flavor of the rolls were excellent, however I found it hard to slice them even after they had been in the frig for a few hours. Next time I make them, I will most likely add some cream cheese so that they are not so soft.

These were great, I served these at my daughters bridal shower and people who didn't even like spinach loved them.

I made these for a baby shower recently with a couple of other roll-up recipes.  This one was the big hit, and I got several requests for the recipe...Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe was a success.  I substituted waterchestnuts for the bacon bits.  Will make again.

I made these for a company potluck and a graduation.  For the graduation, I used low-fat sourc cream and fat-free mayo.  No one could tell the difference and they disappeared quickly at both events!

I took these to a meeting I went to and got lots of raves.  I used different tortillas to give colour.  The only suggestion I have is to dole out a little less on each tortilla.  Mine only made 9.

I made these for a shower...and they disappeared within minutes!  Now everyone asks me to make them for every gathering -- I end up making 2-3 batches at a time!  Everyone loves them -- even my nieces who are younger. I told them it was spinach AFTER they had some and they shrugged and said "I guess I DO like spinach!"  Enjoy!
