I just whipped up a batch of this to use for a dinner later in the week, but I snuck a bite as it came out of the skillet and yum! I didn't have tomato juice on hand, so I used some spicy V8, thinned with a bit of water to cut the heat (so hopefully my daughter will eat it) and omitted the cayenne. Also used liquid smoke instead of browning sauce (not sure what the difference between these 2 is anyway) and cut the brown sugar down to 1 tsp instead of 2. I must say, if I already had the burger buns on hand, I might have one for lunch right now :-) Thanks for the recipe, I'm a huge Roseanne fan so I just had to try it out.

This recipe is good. To me they are like Sloppy Joes. Being a chef I love too cook and am always looking for something different and fun that make my kids want to eat what I make. I will make these again.

Very very good! But the recipe needs pepper (lots) and more seasoning salt.  I hope this is as good as the ones at the Lunchbox on Roseanne because they would surely do well. AWESOME

I was a little concerned about how this would turn out since I didn't have tomatoe juice or browning liquid.  I used two tablespoons of ketchup and filled the rest to 1/4 with ketchup and substitued the browning with liquid smoke.  The results.....DELICIOUS!!! thanks, Teri, this is a keeper!!!

This recipe was good.  We tried it with rice also but what my family actually preferred was putting the meat in a tortilla with refried beans & sour cream.

Tangy, a little spicy, and very messy. Not quite barbecue tasting and more like a Sloppy Joe without the sauce. The worcestershire was dominant in this along with the cayenne, and it seemed like it needed "something" but I don't know what. I used half the onion and a low sodium Season All and only half of what it called for, but it still seemed a little salty to me. This made a fast hot lunch. Thanks Teri.

Was a good quick meal for a week night. I don't think I will be making it very often though. There was just something a little off about it but I couldn't pinpoint it.

This came out somewhere between a Sloppy Joe and seasoned taco meat. I roasted the garlic in the oven rather than saute, but that was the only change I made. The flavor was great, my husband and brother loved it.

As a side note...Roseanne's lunchbox was based on a small restaurant called hte Canteen in Ottumwa, Iowa. Great place. Hard to decribe, but the meat was steamed and chopped unbelievably fine. But it has only dry seasoning.

Made this for a lunch when we were outside working and it was pretty chilly.  We thought it was outstanding.  I am not sure that small children would go for it as much as adults would.  Thanks for this goody! Teri

Tasty and easy to put on any kind of bread or bun you want.  (I didn't have tomato juice but I always have V8 on hand, so I used that...also didn't use as much vegetable oil, only 2 tablespoons).  My family loved i!

This is more like a barbecue or sloppy joe, not a loose meat sandwich, but this was also very good. It had a bit of a 'kick' to it from the cayenne pepper. I doubled the recipe, and added 3 cloves of garlic, just used 1-medium size onion, only added half of the seasoned salt (which was plenty), and I did add 2 tablespoons of flaxseed (for added fiber, plus it helped to thicken the meat filling). Great recipe, and will definitely make again!

I was looking for something different to do with ground beef and I had everything necessary for this recipe.  I really didn't know what to expect as I was not familiar with loosemeat sandwiches.  I thought they were very good, but I think if I were going to make a sandwich with ground beef I'd rather have something like sloppy joes.
