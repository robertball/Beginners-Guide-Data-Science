I only made two small adjustments to this recipe--I used instant CHEESECAKE pudding and half milk chocolate/half dark chocolate chips in this recipe. Baked at 350*, the cookies were done baking at ten minutes. Rich and decadent, these cookies are amazing.

These cookies are WAY too dry.  The cookies did come out thick and chewy as promised, but the flavour and texture was really lacking.  As stated before they were really dry, the only way they were edible at all was dipped in tea.

These cookies were just OK for me, but my granddaughters liked them a lot.  I followed the recipe as is, and the cookies did come out thick and chewy---just not buttery enough for me.

Crisp edge and chewy center. This recipe is excellent. My 20 year old asked me for the recipe. She said it's better than toll house. I'm inclined to agree!

I tried this recipe and followed it without making any adjustments. It came out terrific. I was looking for a thicker,lighter cookie and this was perfect. Now I have the rich buttery chocolate chip cookie recipe  and this one that is equally delicious yet different consistency. Thank you allrecipes! you never let me down. TTFN Patti Forsythe

I didn't read the comments on this recipe until after I had already made the dough.  So before I added the chocolate chips I tasted the dough.  I decided to add a 1/4 cup of white sugar (which seemed to make it tastier)  I also did not have unsalted butter so I used the salted butter that I had- and omitted the salt from the ingredients. However I would tell anyone using this recipe to watch the bake time because mine were done in 9-10 minutes.  Any longer they would have burned.  So overall, they were okay,  My husband also agreed with a previous poster in saying that the cookies were "missing something".  A little disappointed.....

I timed 15 minutes and when I got them out they were still uncooked.

very fluffy batter but bland taste so I changed my second batch a bit by adding a pinch of cinnamon, 2 tbs cream and 1 tbs white sugar. I also didn't have vanilla pudding nix so I used a chocolate one instead.
the cream made it easier to mix and a bit richer. I did dollops on parchment paper instead of balls and they didn't flatten out. very chewy !

A little dry.. Weird after taste.. I think it maybe had too much vanilla extract? Now that I have made these, just noticed that it didn't have white sugar. Maybe if I added it, it would have tasted better. Other than that it was an okay cookie.

I followed the directions exactly. I thought they were really soft and chewy. The batter was dry at first, but I kneaded it with my hands after I added the chocolate chips and the batter resembled the same consistency I am accustomed with chocolate chip cookies. They did not burn in the oven, in fact, I left them in for about 18 minutes since 15 was not enough. They do lack some flavor. I'm not sure if it's the pudding mix that does that. Mine are more doughy than the pictures, but I can bet it was because I forgot the baking soda.

I found the batter a bit dry so I added some milk for easier mixing.  But overall, it tasted great!

I made these cookies and i think the dough tasted better than the cookie but the cookies were very good! The cookies were chewy but they were not thick at all they were very thin maybe I didn't make them big enough I dont know and i thought the vanilla pudding mix would give it a different kick but i couldnt taste the pudding at all! but overall the cookies are very good I would make them again!

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe says and they are good but they are missing something.....can't put my finger on it.
