We really enjoyed this recipe. I did substitute sour cream for the milk, and added a tiny bid of chopped red onion just for flavor. Thanks for sharing!!!

Be sure and thaw the green beans first (just put them in a colander and run some hot water over them).  I used lowfat soup, skim milk, and added 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and simple. Easy to throw together, Yet as tasty as any other green bean casserole I've had. Some times I add a bit of sour cream to this recipe and/or grated cheese. I make this all the time.

Classic recipe. I substituted the French-friend onions by some pan friend onions to cut back on the fat. The baking time needs to be far longer than 30 minutes. After half an hour, the beans are still very crunchy and half frozen. It took almost 1.5 hours before it was well done. However, taste was very good when it was finally done.

What a great recipe.  A friend served this with a slight variation with carrots and cauliflower and it was great.  Quick, easy and satisfying!

Did not have the Dried Onions (left them sitting in the cart at the grocery store)...used Funyons instead...everyone raved!!!  Crunched the Funyons and layered on the bottom.  Put the mixture on top and cooked then 10 minutes out put more crunched Funyons on top with a sprinkle of cheese...DELICIOUS

I made this for two different family Christmas parties and it was a hit!  I still can't believe how easy it was to throw together.  I used frozen french cut beans, thawed and drained and replaced the milk with sour cream.  We had to travel and had limited oven use so we threw everything in a crock pot.  I cooked for about an hour on high, turned it down to low for an hour and kept it at warm while we served it.  I will be making this again and again.

Use sour cream instead of milk and you will have a much better dish. The milk waters it down, sour cream thickens and gives it an amazing taste. TRUST ME on this it will become your familys fav.

Instead of regular Cream of Mushroom soup, I either use Garlic Roasted Cream of Mushroom Soup or just add some garlic powder when stirring up the casserole.

yummy and easy. I did 2/4 milk and 1/4 sour cream.  It is a good base to play from. I add some Red Pepper for flavor and real grilled onions for a fresh taste and I LOVE onions.

A CLASSIC - it is always requested for holiday dinners.  I like this dish because it is easy to prepare ahead of time.  I will often mix it up the day before a big dinner and I guess that the frozen beans thaw a bit in the refrigerator that way.  Even if I bake it right away, I have never had a problem using frozen beans.

I used precooked frozen beans and this was a great recipe to use up a bag of frozen beans that had been in the bottom of the freezer, will most certainly make again.

Very simple and quick recipe.  Make sure you season it well.  If you have any dairy adverse eaters, you might want to use less milk--will be just as good.  This tastes even better a day or so later.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  I thought it was much to bland and the green beans turned out crunchy.  I should have taken the advice of other reviewers to thaw the green beans first or used canned green beans instead.  Next time I'll also add a little salt and maybe less milk so the cream of mushroom soup doesn't lose its flavor so much.

I personally dislike green beans, whoever, my kids and husband love this.  I took the suggestions of a few different reviews. I add 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tbsp of soy sauce. I cut down on the milk a little bit and use a bit of sour cream.  I add sauteed mushrooms or a can of the sliced mushrooms.  My 8 year old loves it.  Asks for seconds!

This was excellent and so easy!  I don't experiment much with recipes, but the only thing I added was some Beau Monde seasoning.  This one will be classified in my database as a favorite.

Classic and yummy, but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  I had to add quite a lot of pepper.  It feels like it's missing an ingredient...

This was the first time my family and I have ever tasted Green Bean Casserole. It was easy to make, but we just didn't care too much for it.
