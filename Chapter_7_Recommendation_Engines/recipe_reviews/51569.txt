Great recipe for mashed potatoes! These are definitely creamy and cheesy! I used red potatoes and left the skins on and added a little garlic and onion powder to taste. I used reduced fat cheddar cheese and Land O Laked light butter to cut down on the fat and calories. I used an electric mixer to get the nice and fluffy. Great side dish!

These potatoes are tasty, but I am not sure they are good enough to justify the fat content.  For that reason alone I will most likely not make them again.  I think you can have potatoes just as rich and creamy without the added fat from the condensed milk.  I will try making these again using regular milk rather than the condensed.

These were absolutely delicious!  I added some minced garlic and about 1/4 cup of chopped onion to the boiling water with the potatoes as I normally do, and these were GREAT!  Thanks very much!

Used FF sour cream instead of the evaporated milk, plus about 1/3 more of the shredded cheese, and the hubby and son inhaled these!

I used organic red potatoes, fat free evaporated milk and lowfat shredded cheese. I did heat the milk and gradually added a little at a time until it was the right consistancy, I had about a 1/3 of a cup leftover after I was finished. This went really well with Meatloaf with a Ranch Twist and salad.

I am awful at making mashed potatoes.  I thought I would give this recipe a try.  The carnation milk is what makes it really creamy.  Try adding some fresh garlic to give it a zing!! Tastes great.

Very good indeed! I have made these potatoes numerous times and they are always a hit. This is a very vesitile recipe. I have changed this recipe up several times (like not adding cheese, adding a different cheese, adding sour cream or using instant potatoes) and they always come out great. Using the evaporated milk is the key to a great tasting creamy mashed potato dish. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I used knock-off brand evaporated milk and left out the cheese and they were still amazing.  Nice and fluffy and rich.  Definitely a success, I will be making all of my mashed potatoes like this in the future.

They turned out way too thick.  I'd skip the evaporated milk next time and just use regular.

No rocket science involved here to make these decadently delicious.  Because of the clarity of the directions these are easy to prepare with guaranteed results even for the novice cook.  As suggested in the recipe, I included chopped green onion and cooked, crumbled bacon.  Just like a loaded twice-baked potato without all the fuss!  I did substitute half-and-half for the evaporated milk and I simply used a hand masher rather than dragging out the mixer.

The carnation really makes the difference. Otherwise the rest of the ingredients are pretty standard. Very easy to make and would make again. Good taste.

I made this for Thanksgiving one year, and every guest asked for the recipe.

You can make this a day or two ahead and re-heat.

What a great comfort food!

I used baby yukon gold potatoes and left the skins on.  Instead of using a hand mixer my husband, actually, mashed them with potato masher and they turned out delicious!  I had my parents over for Christmas Eve dinner and they loved them.  Having the leftovers now, and they are just as good if not better!

These were good; just as good as my regular mashed potatoes made with skim milk.  Don't know if I will spend the extra money buying the FF evaporated milk.  Served with "baked chicken-fried steak with mushroom gravy".  We all enjoyed.

Yes, they were good. So similar in taste to my own with cheese and butter and regular milk, I can't see any reason to waste the evaporated milk on them.

I have been eating a variation of these since I was a kid.  We have always used instant mashed potatoes, make enough for 8-10 servings, then add the evap milk, shredded cheese and some durkee french fried onions, put in a greased casserole dish top with more cheese and onions and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  It seems like it's more work than it actually is and the end result is fantastic, not for the calorie counters.  I will make this and eat it as a meal.

This recipe is great for both kids and husbands.  The cheese and bacon and great additions together.  It suggest to add green onions and if you like them it is great addition.

Tastes great and easy to make.  I made it without adding salt, used unsalted butter, and it didn't miss any flavour at all.

The best!!  Love Love Love these.  They tasted like twice baked potatoes without all the time and effort.  I didn't have any bacon but next time I do I will for sure add it.  The evaporated milk makes them so creamy and rich, I stocked up on it at the store so I will have it on hand every time I make mashed potatoes from now on.  This is a good one for company.

I had to halve this recipe since I was only making it for 2 people and it turned out nicely except it wasn't cheesy enough. I only had skim milk on hand but that worked fine, and added green onions for some kick. I might try some sharper cheese next time. Great side dish, and relatively quick.

Excellent! This came out very creamy & delicious, almost sweet (i guess due to the evaporated milk?). Anyway, I made this for my boyfriend and he must have eaten at least 2 or 3 servings! :) Very easy to make too!

I have never made mashed potatoes before giving this recipe a try, so I would have to say this is a great recipe for the first timer...very easy.  These were quite good, but I do think something is missing as far as flavor.  We love cheese in our house, so I mixed in an extra cup or so, which ended up changing the consistency of the potatoes.  Next time, I think I will just sprinkle some extra cheese on top instead.

My whole family loves these mashed potatoes. I don't use quite as much evaporated milk as the recipe calls for...maybe only half. I use an electric mixer, and as I beat the potatoes, I slowly add the milk. Then I add about 4 oz. of sour cream. MMMMMMM!!

I really cheated on this one but it was terrific. I was in a rush so I used Instant Potatoes, and I left out the cheese. These were so so great!! This will definitely be on our regular menu. Next time I will use real potatoes :>) Served with Chicken Fried Steak.

I have made this also using red potatoes. I use butter and heavy cream or milk to thin it down a little. Also have put in fresh chives, bacon bits and sour cream, kind of a loaded baked potato. Very tasty.

This was delicious and a big hit at our pot-luck supper!  Very easy to make and not very expensive either.
