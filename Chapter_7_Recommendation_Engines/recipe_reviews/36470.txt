Make these all the time, sometimes with, sometimes without ground beef.  I used homemade frijoles with the frijoles recipe from this site.  Very good, thanks Becky ;)

Wow, there is WAY too much salt in this recipe... and I am a salt fiend.  I had to add a second can of beans just to make it edible.  Still didn't care for the combination of spices.  Still, it's a nice idea and I might make it again with my own spice combination.

We loved the fold!  It worked great for the kids and the parents loved it too!  I didn't follow the recipe since some of the reviews said it was too salty, but made my own version of tacos with only a pinch of salt.

Very easy-- I liked that I didn't even have to turn on the stove. For toppings, I had avacado, cheese and green onions only, but it was still very good. I used fat-free sour cream and lactose-free cheese.

Great idea for the folding of the tortillas!  I just used lime-flavored refried beans and didn't add any of the ingredients to it. Other than that I used all the basic taco fillings.  Very good!

My daughter ate the whole batch by herself!  Both my kids and my picky husband loved this recipe.  It is a needed change from the usual meat and potatoes dinner.  Serve with yellow rice or a salad and you have a healthy nutritious meal without the guilt or the gut!  Thanks!

I just added this to my recipe box my kids love burritos!  I am sure these are fabulous, but what I really like about this recipe is the unique way the taco-burrito is folded so all the stuff doesn't fall out!

Don't add the salt and you have a 5 star recipe! The folding technique alone is worth 10 stars!  So easy to eat - see, you get teach this ol' So Cal girl a thing or two!  Thanks!

We are big burrito fans and I like that (1) these are easier to make than the way I had been doing it (no stirring things on the stove) and (2) these are easier to eat (for everyone, not just the kids!)  You can mix and match your own ingredients, though I think spreading sour cream and guacamole on there are must-haves!

This is good.  I love the way you fold the burrito shells.  My kids won't eat the beans though so I make theirs with chicken.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I loved how easy it was and that I didn't need to use the stove at all.  B/c of the reviews about it being too salty, I cut out the salt altogether, didn't add the oregano, and just put a little less onion and garlic in it.
Delicious.

I really like the idea, but I'll be concocting my own version.  This was way too salty.

Very good and very easy. Both kids loved it, even the "bean hater"!  We also loved the fact that they were pretty mess-free.  Will definitely make again.  I didn't have sour cream, so substituted whipped cream cheese, which was good too!
