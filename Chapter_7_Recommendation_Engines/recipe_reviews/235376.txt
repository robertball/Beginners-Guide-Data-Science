Very very good.  I cut the pork shoulder in half, cause the whole thing wouldn't fit (mine was about 8 lbs).  So then I halved the spices.  Covered with water per recipe.  When I had cooked 7 hours it looked good.  The broth had become this lovely dark color and I was leery at throwing it out, so I put it aside.  I added my BBQ and then a little of the dark colored broth it had cooked it to help it all soak in.  I probably added about 1/2 cup.  Really really good.  Served on nice bulky rolls that I toasted, with coleslaw on the side for me.  (and curly fries).  Thanks for this recipe!
