I loved it! I made only half of the listed volume and it was a full pot so I recommend using only 1 -1 1/2 ponds of beef and cut all other ingredients in half.

We liked these albondigas and thought the soup was very tasty. I left out the zucchini and cabbage only because we're not used to having them in our albondiga soup. Other than that, absolutely delicious.

Made my own tomato sauce by blending 4 tomatoes, 1/4 of an onion, about 6 cilantro leaves, and the minced garlic cloves. I halfed the recipe because I was only making some for 2 people and wanted to have some left overs for lunches. I also used about half a cup of cooked Mexican rice instead of the uncooked rice.I have also made this recipe in the past using ground turkey for a healthier option.

Loved it and so did my boyfriend. I changed it up a bit. I used already made chicken broth and also used baby zucchini and carrots. I used about 1/2 cup Kale instead of cabbage too. He want me to make this every week! OMG! Haha

My go to soup on a cold rainy day, or any time i crave it, which is often! 
I sub the ground beef for ground turkey and water for chicken broth, per your suggestions, and I also sub tomato sauce for a can of diced tomatoes. If I don't have zucchini, I sometimes add a can of green beans.
 Always delicious, the best soup ever!   I have shared your recipe with others, and they also agree.

I made this pretty much as the recipe called for.  I erroneously put more seasoning in the meatballs and it was still absolutely fantastic. This could easily become a cold weather go to.  I do advise making half the recipe unless you have a huge family. We ate it for two dinners and a lunch and still froze another 3 meals worth.

Made it for my sisters they loved it. Only made 1/2 batch. Substituted d puréed diced tomatoes in juice instead of tomato sauce. It’s what I had on hand. Great broth can be used for any clear soup base.

Very tasty and easy to make. The flavor really comes together  when the meatballs are added to the soup base and they cook. The rice gives the meatballs a different flavor twist as well.

Very tasty and enjoyed by all in my family of three.  However, the recipe does make a lot of soup so I would do as someone has already recommended and that is to cut all the ingredients down to half.

Worth the time it takes to make it. In Japan where I currently reside, the hamburger is a mix of pork and beef. Needless to say it added a lot of flavor. I will make it again as it is a huge pot that can be shared with neighbors/friends and is delicious!

Fabulous soup!  I make the meatballs earlier in the day and have everything chopped in advance. I double the cabbage and potatoes but I follow broth and meatball ingredients exactly. It makes a LOT of soup and all of it gets eaten! Cilantro is important addition.

The only thing I did different was added a bit more more of all the spices and didnt use cilantro. My husband never liked the dish before until I made it.  Now he cant stop eating it. I think it tasted even better the 2nd day!
