The salsa is excellant! I did serve my salmon warm with a squeeze of lime on it.  The salsa can be made earlier in the day making supper time a breeze. Plus, the flavors have had a chance to meld.  The presentation is very impressive.

the salsa is delicious! I seasoned the salmon with garlic salt, cumin powder and a little lime juice and baked it instead. Great summer recipe!

The salsa is amazing.  Great summer recipe.  Adding a little seasoning to the salmon while cooking gives it great flavor, too.

I made this for a nutrition class - I needed food with Vitamin B12 and was in search of salmon recipes.  Amazing!! It was a huge hit and I even got extra credit. Thanks!

Excellent!  I'd never cooked fish in the microwave before and was a bit skeptical, but it turned out fabulous.  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

So goood! I ommited the corn and red onion (didnt have any on hand so i used a leek instead). I baked the salmon rather than boiling and sprinkled with lemon pepper. After salmon had chilled in the fridge I served it over a bed of fresh spinach and made a sour cream dressing i found on this website.  First words out of my boyfriends mouth was "mmmm....mmmmmmmmmmmmm....you gotta make this again"

I have been making this for many years.  It is a perfect accompaniment for salmon.  The fresh corn and tomatoes of summer make it very tasty.

I loved this recipe. We grilled the salmon on a cedar plank but otherwise followed as stated. I added the avacado last so it would not bruise, and I was surprised how long it stayed green - I have leftover salsa and it still looks fresh almost 24 hours later!

Maybe it's just me, based on the other reviews, but the salmon was extremely dry. I would have rather cooked it normally than tried the microwave option. The salsa was bland, imo, and didn't make up for the dryness and lack of flavor in the salmon. Sometimes I know I can change something about the way I prepared the meal and try again, but based on what I tasted the first time around, I think I'll just be looking for a new recipe.
