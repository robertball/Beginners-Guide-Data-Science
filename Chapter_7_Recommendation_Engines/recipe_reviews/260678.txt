This was great! I didn't even bother draining the  grease or removing the sausage from the skillet. As soon as the sausage was done I dumped in the flour and started making the gravy. Instead of one large pre-baked pizza crust I decided to do individual pizza's and this worked really good.  This is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
