I found this easy to do. I'm thinking I would like mozzarella better than the Swiss cheese and I might want to add a little marinara sauce to the mixture. Will definitely make again for appetizer or evening snack. I'd like to try making and freezing ahead.

Fabulous!  Not just as an appetizer but also as a light meal.  Did not squeeze all the juice from the olives and the peppers and then mixed these into the cream cheese before I spead onto bread.  Made it easier to spread and got all ingredients thoroughly mixed.  YUM!

This was pretty good! I used ground pork instead of ground sausage. For dough I bought fresh pizza dough from the grocery store deli. It was very yummy! Only issue is that my dough didn't brown. I would brush oil over it if I did this again. Other than that, no issues!

I modified this slightly by using chive & onion cream cheese and "hot" sausage.  Instead of one large loaf, I rolled out the dough, cut in half, and baked two loaves of bread.  Also, I think it was easier to move two small loaves to the baking sheet rather than one large, stuffed one.  Ate one today with a bowl of homemade bean soup and put the second baked loaf in the freezer.  This is good.

Quick, easy and very tasty! I substituted the swiss cheese for shredded mozzarella, provolone and cheddar. I skipped the poppyseed and brushed the bread with melted butter after it baked for 20 minutes and topped with mozzarella, put in the oven for about 3-4 more minutes! Great...

I found this to be very, very boring. Also, it was VERY DIFFICULT to pick-up the dough that had been filled and place it on the baking sheet. To help with this problem, I suggest cutting the dough in half b4 filling it and then place the two filled 1/2s on the baking sheet and/or place the rolled out dough on the baking sheet b4 filling it and then fill it  with the sausage mixture on the baking sheet so you don't have to lift the unbaked roll onto the baking sheet.

Okay, YUM! Only thing is that for the life of me I could not roll out my one pound loaf of bread dough into a 16" x 12" rectangle. I worked on it for quite some time and got it to about 15" x 8" and that was perfect. I recommend thawing two loaves because there is easily enough filling with these ratios to fill two, and you'll want two! I omitted the olives and subbed shredded Italian cheese blend for the Swiss. Reduced oven temp to 375 and baked for 20 minutes to golden brown perfection.

Excellent!  The bread dough that I used absolutely would not roll out to 12" wide.  I rolled it to about 7"x16", put the filling on it, and stretched the dough up & over, pinching the seam as I went.  It worked very well.  (Don't forget to pinch the ends as well!) Didn't have shredded Swiss, so I used 5-cheese Italian.  Friends & family raved!

I really had high hopes for this one, but I have to say we didn't enjoy it at all.  The flavors were weird.  I did sub mozzarella like many others suggested.

I made this for a football get together and everyone loved it! A friend even had me print the recipe out for her take home!  The only changes I made were using black olives instead of kalamat and didn't use the poppy seeds.  This will be in the rotation for appetizers from now on!

I made this last night and it was great...modified it by sauteing red bell peppers and mushroom in with the sausage and I used mozzarella instead of swiss.  Skipped the olives since I didn't have any.

We didn't love this but it wasn't the worst.  With some tweaks our family would enjoy it.  Not a fan of the cream cheese in it.

I made this for a party and watched two of my husband's friends eat the entire loaf.  I had to make it again so I could taste it!  So I made it for another party, and luckily this time I got a piece before it was all gone.  It goes quickly, because it's hard to stop eating once you've started.

Made this two Christmases ago and now it is mandatory for Thanksgiving too! Substituted 
mozzarella for the Swiss....and made one like the recipe calls, cream cheese and the others using ricotta. Both are fantastic and easy!

We LOVED this! I used 1/2 mild and 1/2 hot Italian sausage, and rolled this more like a stromboli. This baked up beautifully and the flavors are excellent...This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this for Christmas Eve party and it went over very well.  Had several requests for the recipe. Plan on making it again for something different for dinner. We are not much on olives so I did delete them from the recipe.

I made this several months ago as an appetizer for about 40 of my friends who came over. They raved about it, and several asked for the recipe. Made it exactly as listed, except I omitted the poppy seeds. Still very good. Making it for supper tonight, as the main dish! :)

This was great! I omitted the olives but only because I didn't have any. I also used garlic powder as opposed to minced and Shredded Italian cheese in place of the Swiss. I think this would be even better as individual sausage breadsticks.
