I've been using this recipe for quite some time now. Whenever I make it I'm always sure to make more than one & even then it only lasts minutes. Everybody loves it soooo much! Plus it is super simple to make. I've also found that you can use fresh strawberries just as easily as frozen so this really works with whatever you have on hand. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful & easy recipe!

My husband and friends liked this pie, but I thought it was way too sweet.  I was eager to try the recipe, as I make a chocolate pie very similar to this.  I melt Hershey bars with milk and marshmallows, cool, and fold in whipped cream before pouring into the crust to set overnight.  I think that the chocolate version is plenty sweet, but somehow the strawberry pie just disappointed me.

Absolutely wonderful!  Also can use drained crushed pineapple instead of strawberries.  Disappears in a flash!

Turned out great! This is delicious; not too sweet at all. I used chopped fresh strawberries instead of pureed frozen. DH wants me to puree the strawberries next time and put it in a graham cracker crust.
