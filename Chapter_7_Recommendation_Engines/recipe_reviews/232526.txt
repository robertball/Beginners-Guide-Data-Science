2-22-2016  ~Know what Hubs said with one thumb up, the other holding onto his spoon, and his mouth full of chili?   “Best  chili I’ve ever had!  I want you to make it again, exactly the same way.” This is real kudos to Bob (and to me too since I tinkered with the recipe a little).  What caught my eye about this recipe were the additions of bacon and liquid smoke, neither of which I’ve ever used, and both of which took this recipe to the Chili Hall of Fame in our book (and let it be known, I am not a huge fan of chili).  Because of Hubs’ sensitive innards I had to cut back some on the chili powder but this chili is so packed with flavor that caused no harm.  Just as I had hoped, the bacon and liquid smoke gave it a flavor distinction from other chili with subtle smokiness that made this unusually delicious.  Still, while I’m sure it was good stuff as is, in our book my tweaks took this from good to great. Along with the onions, I also added chopped green pepper and celery because we love both it in our chili. I also used half kidney beans and half chili beans. And I have to be honest; I don’t know why water was called for.  Water has no flavor!  I used my own tomato sauce from my garden instead.  So I essentially used half fire-roasted tomatoes, and half tomato sauce, no water.   This is an excellent recipe that I’m sure Bob has no problems with anyone tweaking.   I’m sure I’ve not heard the end of this from Hubs; and that’s a GOOD thing.

Bob's Little Known Less Cared About Chili Haiku: "This should've been great, but there was too much cumin. I will make again!" Bob's chili was pretty good, but 1 TB of cumin (and we really like cumin!) was just the dominant flavor here. Put some Fritos and cheese on top, along with extra Chipotle Tabasco, but the cumin was still all we could taste. A chili that next time around will be 5 stars for us, I'm sure.

We've made this twice, once following the instructions completely and once skipping the bacon and liquid smoke. I'm in the minority who prefers it without the bacon/smoke flavour but my bacon-loving family prefers it the first way! Without the bacon, this is exactly the kind of simple, clean chili that packs warmth without too much heat and totally fantastic flavour. I usually add sweet pepper and corn to chili, but this one is so perfect that I tend to add those on the side.

I don’t write many recipe reviews, but I must say this chili is amazing!  I’ve tried many chili recipes  in the past, but those days are over! This is the only one I need in the future.  I made a couple of minor changes, cutting the cumin amount in half and using smoked paprika instead of liquid smoke.  Oh, and beef broth for the liquid. I think the bacon and fire roasted tomatoes took this to genius level, and hubby and I both about popped our buttons on extra helpings.  We’ll be having this often.

This was fantastic!  My husband has said at least a dozen times how delicious it was. My picky kids went back for seconds.  Easy and satisfying.  I used an entire package of thick cut bacon since my family loves it so, and 2 lbs. ground beef because I had two 1 lb packages and didn't want to leave a half pound behind to figure out what to do with.  Remaining ingredients exactly as written.  I cooked the bacon/onion in  a skillet first & drained then cooked the ground beef & drained then added both to slow cooker along with remaining ingredients . Served with sour cream, shredded cheese and corn chips.  This will be my new go-to chili recipe going forward.

I've made this twice now.  The first time, I followed the recipe exaclty, and it's simply the BEST chili I've ever tasted.  I used Old El Paso Chilli Powder (the only chili seasoning you can easily get here in Australia) and it was great.

The second time I made it, I was drinking a Guinness and substituted two cups of that instead of water.  WOW!  It took the flavor to the next level.

Sour cream is the ultimate garnish for this fine dish.  

It's a WINNER!

5 stars, for those of you who like to tinker with a recipe and then grade it, don't.  Cook it as written and you will not be disappointed.

This is the first time I have made a Chili I LOVED, I never order it out I am always disappointed. I followed another readers suggestion and subbed the water for bottled Guinness. I was a little short of bacon, So I added some chorizo OMG cant wait to make this again. It took a little nearer to 2 hours to really come together as I like my chili "Fork Friendly"

It was the best chili I ever made.  

I followed the recipe close enough but not exactly.  I added a short tablespoon of cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and garlic powder instead of cloves.   

I used dry beans and precooked them in a slow cooker, added the rest  and pressure cooked it for 8 minutes on high.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Smokey flavor, meaty, and just perfect with corn bread. I did add about 4 dashes of hot sauce and it came off with a tiny hint of it. Not hot at all. Next time I might use a little more of the hot sauce but it was so good this way!

Tried several different chili’s from Allrecipes and this chili is amazing!!! Husband loved it and he is not a big chili fan. I did take one of the suggestions from other reviews and use a can of tomato sauce and only 1/4 cup of water. I didn’t change anything else.

I made this almost exactly according to recipe.  I only say ‘almost’ because after I added the raw hamburger meat to the onion/bacon mix (and added cumin) there was SO much grease that I couldn’t not drain it.  The instructions just say to skim the grease off the top, but if you’re going to do that, I would recommend going with a lean meat.  I’ve been trying to find a good chili recipe for awhile, and have had quite a few duds.  This one turned out well.  If you like hearty chili this will prob be a fav for you.  I gave it four stars only because of the grease issue and the fact that I think I prefer my chili a little sweeter than this.  I also think green peppers would have complimented this well.  Overall good recipe.

I did not cook the bacon or beef in the same pot as the rest of the ingredients to remove all the grease.  Doing it this way made the chili OK,  but not great.  It might have been better with the grease but that is not how we cook.

Love this chili recipe.  This is our go to weeknight recipe.  Dont worry when it seems very soupy at first-with time on the stovetop it comes together and thickens up.

I will make this again!  I made this for Super Bowl Sunday. My husband thought it was a little too spicy, so next time I will adjust a few things. I did use my own home canned tomatoes.  Maybe next time I will try some of the other suggestions.  Overall we like this one , it' a keeper!

I made this pretty much the same way, except I substituted the water for beef broth, used turkey bacon, didn't add the smoke flavoring, and added some brown sugar. It came out delish!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I am by no means a chili lover, but I gotta say this was good!  I took other reviewer's suggestions and came up with these tweaks.  I added one chopped green pepper, and 3 stalks of celery and 1/2 a large jalapeno (minced)-we like spicy.  I also substituted tomato sauce for the water but ended up  adding about a 1/2cup of water at the end to "thin" it out a bit from the simmering.  I put all the beans in with all the juices that were in the can.  Just excellent.  Really, really good.

Great chili recipe! I also added some celery and green pepper. For the beans, I used a can of red kidney beans and a can of chili beans. I bought liquid smoke just for this recipe, and it surely enhances the flavor. Delicious on a cold winter day during a blizzard, topped with some shredded cheddar cheese. Yum!

Wow!!! The liquid smoke flavoring adds SO much to this chili recipe!!! Keep in mind a little bit goes a long way!! The smokiness is very flavorful and delicious! I added green pepper, another can of diced tomatoes, skipped the water,  used chili beans, black beans. and kidney beans.I served with fritos and shredded cheese. Love this recipe, Bob. Thanks for sharing!!!

I was searching for a quick and easy chili recipe and the unusual name caught my eye. I did not have liquid smoke but followed rest of recipe as written. Hubby and I both loved it and will definitely make again.

This is great chili. I love the flavor of the bacon and cumin together. I think this might be my new favorite.

Instead of using all kidney beans, I mixed in 1 can each of kidney, black and chili beans.  Love the bacon flavor & liquid smoke!

This was simple, quick and really good!  Other reviewers nailed it when they said -- "why water"?  I used 1 small can tomato sauce, a bottle of corona and a little beef bouillon powder mixed w/ a little water.  We did 1 can great northern and 1 can black beans.  Also used Chipotle chili powder.  Topped w/shredded sharp cheddar, dollop of sour cream and some crushed tortilla chips.  Yummy!!  Thanks Bob!

It was good as is(I did use beef stock in place of water), but for my own personal taste, I think I'll end up using more tomatoes, or a tomato sauce next time.

Loved this recipe!!! I used ground turkey, cut up pieces of sirloin steak, along with bacon. I did not have liquid smoke, so I used smoked paprika. I was delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

This was my first time making chili and it was worth the long wait. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. Although, we added more vegetables to ours because my boyfriend loves his veggies and he's good about encouraging me to eat more of them too.  So, we added red, green, and orange peppers and corn.  At the end we garnished with an Anaheim pepper and green onion. It was really delicious and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

This was really great, and a nice change from the tomato based chili I normally make.  I used 1 can of kidney beans, 1 can of chili beans, and 1 can of black beans, and also threw in a can of corn.  I added 2t beef bouillon to the water.  My family loved it.

Well, all I can say is, that in this household, Bob's Little Known, Less Cared About Chili is "Hugely Known, Greatly Cared About Chili"!!!  We loved it!  My hubby has always declared my chili the best ever, but I happily concede to being second best!  The only change I made was using French's Chili-O in place of the chili powder called for in the recipe...and...for the 'to taste' of the hot sauce I used 3 dashes.  Thanks Bob for a uniquely delicious chili!

Super simple and easy to make. I used half a package of bacon, only one pound of ground beef, only 2 cans of beans, and added a chopped bell pepper. I used the full amount of spices and they were great. Really great recipe that’s easy to modify. I didn’t even need to simmer it for the recommended amount of time. Probably only simmered 20-30 minutes and we could have eaten it then.

Absolutely DELICIOUS chili!  I felt I needed to add a little more liquid, so I used beef broth.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Highly recommend.

Loved this. Made a few changes after reading reviews --  Shiner Bock beer (2) in place of water plus 1-8oz. can of tomato sauce (the can of tomatoes just wasn't giving it the tomato-iness I was looking for). I used 90% lean ground beef to get around the greasiness some complained of and cooked it about 90% of the way, then drained before I cooked the bacon mixture. I added it back to the pan to finish cooking after the bacon, onions, and garlic were sautéed until the onion was translucent. I cut the cumin to 1/2 T and skipped the salt, just used pepper. I used all pinto beans -- it's whatever your preference is on the beans. I let it simmer for nearly 3 hours before we ate it. Absolutely delicious!

It was OK. Needed more liquid. I expected the meat to be surrounded by that thick broth. Will not make again. I will look for another recipe

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I'd only eaten Wendy's Chili before, but this trumped it by far. It was so rich, filling and thick! I will be making this on many a cold winter night.

A little spicy but not over powering

Really good. The liquid smoke added some yummy flavor. I doubled recipe, but cut cummin, beans and chili powder in half. Some family members added some hot sauce after.  Two family members asked for recipe too.

I accidentally put in 1 tablespoon of Colgin's liquid smoke, but it still tasted great. I put in one cup of water and 1 cup of homemade beef broth. I prefer a bit more tomato flavor in my chili, but the family loved this recipe.

I used tomato sauce instead of water and that was a mistake.  The finished chili tasted too tomatoey and the flavor of the chili powder was lost in the tomatoes.  I also noticed that my Whole Foods Brand uncured bacon lacked the flavor of my usual brand.   Even after making it the day before and allowing the flavors to mellow overnight, my husband and I found this one dimensional and lacking in flavor.  On day three I added water and reheated it, topping each portion with hot sauce. Much better! If I give it a whirl again I will definitely make as directed.

I loved this and I wouldn't change a thing. The flavors were awesome and like a lot of soups and stews tasted even better the next day. This will definitely be in my winter rotation!
