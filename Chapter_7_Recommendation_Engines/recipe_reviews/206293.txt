Fabulous! If you love caprese salad, then you'll love this sandwich. I didn't bother roasting the garlic - a little too involved for lunch... I just added some minced garlic to butter with a splash of olive oil and spread that over the bread. I broiled that until nice and golden brown. I sliced the tomatoes and sprinkled a little kosher salt and cracked black pepper over top then drizzled with the balsamic vinegar. I then assembled the sandwich and didn't bother putting it back into the oven. I cut it into sections and it was oh so yummy!

it is good, but I find using artisian bread sliced, put on a home grown tomato, fresh basil and lots of mozzarella cheese (or preferred cheese)and broil till melted is very good. Garlic is a little strong and takes away from natural tomato taste.

This is a good sandwich. I don't always toast mine, sometimes I eat them fresh without being toasted. I use a garlic ciabatta bread from Trader Joes that already has chunks of fresh garlic in it. I also used some great colorful heirloom tomatos or romas and organic basil. I leave out the butter. This is a great, easy, and fresh lunch or dinner idea. I liek to make one and take it with me in a plastic sandwich container when I am running errands too.

Yummy!! I didn't change anything at all. It was perfect. I love caprese salad but I wondered if the roasted garlic would be an issue. Well, it wasn't. The garlic MAKES this sandwich! I did add the balsamic as well. Will make again (and again, and again...)

This was super easy, and the garlic paste made me swoon. I used pesto instead of basil since I didn't have any basil. I thought the rosemary was a bit over powering for my tastes (I wanted to taste the garlic more than the rosemary), so I'll probably completely omit it.

Pretty good.  I don't have garlic I can roast, so I just spread minced garlic with the butter and then toasted.  It worked fine, and I'm not of the opinion that garlic isn't good with this sandwich.  Although I love basil and tomato and mozzarella, I'm not absolutely in love with this sandwich--not sure why, though.  It did take less time to bake than stated, and I couldn't really taste the rosemary.  I think fresh rosemary would be better.  Thanks for the recipe!

A wonderful end-of-summer combination of ingredients and textures.  The best tomatoes of the year and (in our version) freshly-made basil pesto.  Toasted ciabatta really is the perfect choice for bread--nicely "bulky" but not heavy.  The family felt balsamic vinegar was critical to the dish.  This may have been especially true because rosemary didn't sound quite right and I omitted it. Otherwise, made precisely as directed.  A wonderful recipe.

I admit I didnâ€™t bother to roast the garlic first.  I simply minced the garlic, added it to the butter to spread on the bread.  It was excellent.  We thought this was an easy and tasty sandwich, and a great use of tomatoes and basil in your garden.

Really good! I will admit I just put minced garlic and live oil on the stove for the first part of the recipe and then followed the rest. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and extra bonus that it is vegetarian.

We made this on the grill and toasted the bread too much so it was super crispy. Next time, we'll toast the buttered bread directly on the grill for like 30 sec. Then slather with pesto (we couldn't find fresh basil - crazy!) on one side and garlic on the other and then put mozzarella on one side and the tomato on the other, put it on a baking sheet (cold) and onto the grill until the cheese is soft.

Surprisingly easy and tasty! The only ways I differ from the recipe: instead of roasting the garlic, I add some minced garlic to the butter before toasting the bread. This is purely a time-saver--I'm sure it's awesome with the roasted garlic paste! I also don't toast the tomatoes and basil for as long as suggested. Instead, I toast the bottom half of the sandwich with the mozzarella until it starts getting melty, and then I add the half with the tomatoes and basil, so they warm up a bit but still hold their structure. Purely a personal preference.

I made this last night and it was delicious. It was a little bland, next time I will add a few more spices and use more butter. I didn't bake the garlic, must added to the butter mixture.

We just had these sandwiches in Italy last week, so of course we had to try to make them when we got home.  They were excellent!

This sandwich was great. Would give it five stars, but the prep time was too long so I made small changes. I didn't roast the garlic only minced it and sprinkled over the buttered bread before toasting (10 minutes). I liked the rosemary, but I'm sure it would be just as good with or without it. For step 4 I put it under the broiler for about two minutes to melt the cheese and cook the tomatoes. Perfect.

Ok recipe maybe a little too garlic-y.(and I love lots of garlic usually). Also an hour for preparing a sandwich seemed a little extensive and by the time I was done I ate it in just a few bites haha

This was very good! The only thing that I didn't care for was the tomatoes and basil being cooked, so next time I would leave those off until after I take it out of the oven. I couldn't find ciabatta bread today, of course, lol, so I used a baguette. Also, I omitted the rosemary b/c I wasn't feelin' it, and just mixed the roasted garlic w/ the butter and went from there. I drizzled the finished sandwich w/ a little basalmic glaze, and that was great! The roasted garlic really made this stand out from the rest, and I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
