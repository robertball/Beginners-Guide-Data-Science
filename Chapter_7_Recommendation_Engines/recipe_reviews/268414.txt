I have to say I was very surprised by this recipe! With such few ingredients, and the cooking method, I was expecting issues. This was delicious and the chicken was juicy and tender.  I did season the chicken breasts after I took them out of the water with some garlic powder and salt. I think it would have been bland otherwise. I suggest using a good quality BBQ sauce because this will greatly affect the overall taste.  Don't use thick-cut bacon as it won't be cooked in time.  Even the regular bacon was just barely done, but still tasty!  I might suggest only simmering the chicken 8 minutes, and cooking longer in the oven to help ensure the bacon is done. You could also simmer in chicken broth, or add seasonings to the water. Or, just cook it all in the oven.  I also don't think you need the full 12oz of BBQ sauce, but use what you prefer.  Pound the chicken breast to an even thickness so it cooks evenly.  I'd definitely make this again!

I didn't have high expectations but the family really liked it.  12 min cook time in over wasn't enough for me.  Depends on how thick the chicken is of course.  I guess anything that includes bacon is liked by a teenage boy.

The bacon didn't cook that well. I thought it would give the chicken a lil taste of bacon but no. I won't make it again. It was very blah.

I made small adjustments and came up with a dish my husband asked me to make again soon. I used a can of chicken broth, 3 Tablespoons lemon juice, and 1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning with enough water to barely cover the chicken pieces and then simmered for about 15 minutes. While that was simmering, I partially cooked the bacon -- not to the crisp state but maybe half done. I could still wrap two slices of bacon around each piece of chicken breast. I baked it at 375 degrees F for about 14-15 minutes. Very good with rice on the side.

So delicious even my picky kids loved it! I added some Swiss cheese in the last 10 min and we had no leftovers. Definitely sharing this with friends!

This dish was great. I tripled the recipe and had to add 15 minutes extra cook time.  My husband loved it.

It was very easy to make since I'm a southern girl I did add some spices to the chicken after I precook.

This was good and easy to make.  It's a perfect weeknight recipe because you probably already have all of the ingredients in your refrigerator, it's a one-pan dish, and prep/cooking time is short.  I'll definitely keep this in my rotation.

It was fabulous. I only gave it a 4 because of how unhealthy it is but we all know anything that tastes that good can’t be healthy. lol

It turned out to be amazing! I had thicker pieces of chicken breasts so, my cook time with addition to the bacon, took about 20 minutes. I cooked the chicken in chicken broth instead of water. Also, I seasoned the breasts to bring out the flavor. The family was happy. I did get compliments from the family. That's a win-win for me! ??
