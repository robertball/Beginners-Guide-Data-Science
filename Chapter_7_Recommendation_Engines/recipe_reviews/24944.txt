Snow ice cream is not about creamy, gourmet ice cream.  It's about gathering snow together in between making snow angels and snowball fights, celebrating winter, and making memories.  Today, we made a memory.  Thank you!

Oh boy! This is such a fun and yummy treat! We make this everytime it snows. Another variation is to sprinkle in some kool-aid mix and have the snow cream flavored! Lime is my very favorite.

Hello,
I thought I might have been the only one that likes this.  Everyone that I have told this recipe to look at me as if I were crazy or something.  I also remember making it with my mother.  Thank you.

This recipe wasn't a total bomb, as it didn't taste bad.  I dont think you can really call it ice cream.  The sugar makes it chunky, while adding milk makes the snow runny.  It also gets little chunks of frozen milk in it.  I would like to try the first snow ice cream recipe, but I'll have to wait as I can't leave my house for eggs due to all the smelly snow.

I have made this since my little brother and I found a recipe without eggs (grosses me out).  This can easily be scaled down and adjusted to your tastes (using chocolate, different sauces and add ins).  I've always mixed the sugar, vanilla, and milk together and then the snow, which helps get rid of some of the grainy-ness that comes along with adding sugar after.  Love to make this with my toddler--and she can help!

So glad I stumbled across this recipe!  Exactly the way I made it in years past.  Here in Virginia no one seems to have ever heard of it, but try it, you will love it.

I just made this for my husband and myself.  I have never had snow cream, but my husband used to eat it at his grandmother's house.  He said this recipe tasted exactly like what his grandmother used to make.  Delicious!  We will be making it for our children as well.

I grew up eating snow ice cram, but my mom used evaporated milk that she froze slightly.  I think it tastes so much better.  This is not like store bought ice cream.  Why would anyone expect it to be?  This is a family thing that parents can do with their children.  Kids love watching it be made and eating it!  lol.  I definitely would not use eggs, well I guess you can if you don't mind some salmonella ice cream, Eww.

We used to do this as a kid as well, but only at the cabin (the snow was cleaner) we would use evaporated milk though, it was riche.

Fun recipe to make! I added too much milk, but it would have come out pretty good otherwise. Just for personal preference, I'd half the sugar. This is fun for the family, especially kids. My daughter enjoyed her bowl of snow!

Very easy and yummy.  Tastes just a vanilla snowball (/sno-cone).  Try putting caramel syrup on top - it is perfect!  Eat as much as you can the first night, it gets hard to scoop when it's not fresh.  Seriously, go for the caramel sauce... gives it that richness that it's lacking.

this was great! I set out making snow ice cream because....well it snowed. There are 2 snow ice cream recipes I made on this site, this one and the Snow Ice Cream I, I totally prefer this recipe over the other one hands down. This one was very much light, flavorful, and sweet. My sugar brokedown and melded with the recipe very nicely. My mom made snow ice cream all the time when I was a kid living in Newfoundland because it snowed all the time.. She alway used evaporated milk and it was awesome. But I won't be eating that way ever again because of this recipe. My family was soo impressed that I made 2 batches. And changed the 2nd batch by replacing the vanilla extract with Imitation Strawberry Extract and red food coloring to make Strawberry Snow Ice Cream...my family totally said this recipe ROCKS. I think using milk in this recipe made it light an airy. And I totally could replace the sugar with splenda and use lowfat milk. Awesome. it's a total keeper. Thank you very very much.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  Next time I will follow other reviewers advice and combine the sugar/milk (or cream) ahead of time to dissolve the sugar granules.  Even with some extra "grit", this snow ice cream was a hit!  Very sweet!

The secret to the best snow cream is to use only evaporated milk instead of whole milk. More calories? Of course. More flavor? Absolutely!

So we wouldn't have gritty ice cream, I subbed chocolate syrup for sugar. I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and still had plenty to share with my 5-y-o. We made snow popsicles with the leftovers.

it was a quick and easy dessert for dinner with friends and no one believed it was snow.  We drizzled chocolate syrup over it. And I agree with another, mix and put in freezer then eat...it won't be as runny.  Where we live snow is in abundance in the winter so this worked out perfectly!!!  Just remember don't collect the yellow snow :)

Simple and good.  My 12-year-old has become an expert at making this.  I tend to add extra vanilla because I like a more rich taste.  Once we got a bit too much sugar in it, so we added cocoa and it was great!  Thanks so much!

We made this "Snow Ice Cream" and ended up with lots of uses.  It is great in coffee, with chocolate sauce on top and mixed around, in soft drinks, and with sprinkles or mandarin oranges on top.  And it was lots of fun with the kids!

Like so many others, this brought back wonderful childhood memories.  For better results, mix the sugar and vanilla together first, adding a splash of milk to help combine. THEN go out and retrieve the snow. It melts remarkably fast once it gets inside. Don't premeasure the milk and just dump it in. Instead, add as necessary to make your desired consistency.  Because this is the week before Christmas, we have egg nog in the fridge and used it instead of milk and it made the treat creamy and oh so yummy! For those who don't like overly sweet treats, you may want to reduce the sugar and/or vanilla if using egg nog instead of milk. We didn't but then we liked it super sweet. Enjoy!

Yummy, but I used Splenda instead of sugar.  Calories are lessened considerably in this sweet cream.  No, it's not really ice-cream, for those of you expecting it to be just like ice cream.  More like the shaved ice you get in the summer but thicker and creamier.  If you don't like it as soft and runny, then put it in the freezer for a while.  VERY GOOD LOW CALORIE ICE CREAM SUBSTITUTE.

Yummy!  Some complained about the consistency - the trick is to mix the 'kitchen ingredients' first, making sure the sugar is dissolved in the milk before pouring on the snow.  
Will make again!

It's good, but waayy too much vanilla in my opinion.  One teaspoon is plenty!  Otherwise it's perfect.  Might I also suggest sprinkles?

Made this for my kiddo's today...they loved it:)) I hadn't had snow ice cream since I was a kid! Made for a fun afternoon:) I used sugar in the raw and 1/2 & 1/2. They topped it with crushed peanut butter m&m's. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is much creamier if you substitute half and half for the milk.  Heat the half and half, sugar, and vanilla on the stovetop, stirring constantly just till sugar is dissolved.  Refrigerate (or just cover and sit out in the snow!).  When the mixture has cooled, stir in enough snow to make ice cream consistency!

This is SO yummy, but I don't measure out ingredients, just eyeball it. I also mix up the milk, sugar, and vanilla extract in a small bowl BEFORE adding to snow.

I am aalmost ashamed to say that I have lived in the Appalachian Mountains for my entire life, thus seeing many feet of snow throughout the years, but have never once made snow cream until today.  I followed this recipe almost exactly, give or take a little on the amount of snow.  It tasted great!  Not too milky, not too chunky, simply a delicious, sweet wintry treat!

Very Good!  Who would've thought we could make this in Oregon on the valley floor???  After mixing and it just starts softening up, mix it again to get the sugar lumps out.  Very yummy!  I like the texture--my kids loved it!  Thanks!  I always heard about this as a kid, but in Tx we never got much of a chance to try it.

Fun, Fun for my kids...they just kept laughing as they ate their creamy snow=)  My hubby kind of choked it down, as he is used to the solid, creamy store-bought ice cream, but overall this was perfect for our blizzardish day!

This recipe is awesome. I remember it as a child as well. My Nana or Aunt would put a big bowl outside during the first snow of the year in NYC, when the bowl was full we'd celebrate with Snowcream. :) (we add double the vanilla though-- and a dash of cinammon-- my Dad liked a half cup of italian espresso added)-- one hint? Use a stainless steel mixing bowl. It won't melt while preparing it. And use an actual GALLON of snow-- or yes, the vanilla will be too powerful.

This is FREAKING AWESOME :) I am an ice cream fanatic so this is really a great recipe for me :) 1 whole cup of sugar was WAY too much though. It was so sweet! Next time I will half it. I can't wait to experiment with new flavors!

Unfortunately we werent impressed with this at all . It melts almost immediately. The sugar doesnt melt therefore leaving the snow gritty. The only plus to this was the flavor was pretty good. I dont think I'll be trying this again.

Suprisingly very tasty. Almost like a frozen cream soda. I mixed the cream base up first and then gradually added in the snow.

This is how we made it when i was a child, and the sugar wouldnt dissolve, making for a  gritty bowl of cream.     Variation:..Use 1 14oz can of Sweetened Condensed Milk to 8 cups of Snow....ad vanilla, almond or other flavorings.....  can also add flavored coffee creamers {I love the Mocha Peppermint and the Irish Creme}..or yu can use  Dry Kool Aid or Jello for fruit flavors!!!

(Same recipe as Snow pudding)We had a wonderful time making and eating this!  I used confectioners sugar and mix it in well and put the milk mixture into the freezer for 1/2 hour to make it slushy then went outdoors for the snow! This is so much fun for the children, thank you.

This was a wonderful/fun recipe!  We used 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract for a single recipe (instead of 1/4 tsp) and it was delicious.  It's also good w/Carolan's Irish Cream or Malibu Rum (for the grown ups).  Enjoy! :-)

It tasted pretty good, and it worked out pretty fast, but there it melted after about a minute, and on the top was vanilla, sugar, and a tiny bit of snow, and the bottom was all melted snow. I would suggest that anybody who wants to use this recipe should freeze when all the ingredients are mixed, then blend it for a minute or two to get a slushy-like mixture.

Just the way my mom, Grandma, & Great- Grandma made it! Except for the milk use canned milk instead. It gives a more old fashioned taste.

This recipe is JUST how my Nana made it for us when we were children, I loved it then and I love it now.  I have made it with half & half, to make it more creamy, and I have made GREAT chocolate 'ice cream' just by using chocolate milk {it is so thick from the carton, and has enough sugar, so all you need is the chocolate milk and the snow ...& you are ready to go!!!!

Make sure you wait until after the first deep snowfall before gathering snow. I add the vanilla and sugar to taste. Evaporated milk gives a creamier texture than milk. For an extra treat, stir in wild berries. Store leftover snow cream in the freezer. This is a winter treat for all ages

Bring on the flood of memories. Made this as a kid and was able to make it for my family this year on Christmas Eve. So very special.

We just made this, it is really good. Much better then I thought. It tastes like a vanilla italian ice. We added chocolate chips and it really made it fun!You can cut the recipe in half and it's plenty for 4-5 kids. Thanks for sharing, the kids (and me too!) had a great time.

Was perfect!  I made sure to get the vanilla all stirred in evenly before adding the milk.  The kids loved it and we had a lot of fun with it.

Great recipe!  My children and daycare children all loved it.  For days when it is just too cold to go outside...bring some winter fun inside.  I used a can of sweetened condensed milk in place of the milk and sugar.  Great texture and taste.  The kids are begging for me.   Thanks for the great recipe!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars mostly for the memories it brings back. This is very good. It is just like a vanilla sno cone with cream added.
My 3 year old loves to help me make it and also loves to eat it!

I am so confused by the people that said the sugar wouldn't dissolve. You should've mixed the sugar, milk, and vanilla in a separate bowl before combining it with the snow and then there is no problem. Also for those that add egg just be careful since you are consuming a raw egg. This is the exact same recipe my Mother used when I was growing up and my brother and I loved making it. It's not suppose to be the best tasting ice cream in the world, it is just fun. So loosen up and enjoy some time with your kiddos and make snow ice cream!

Love it! I made this with my dad every winter as a kid, now I'm making it with my kids along with some great memories. Thank you!! For those who had issues with undisolved sugar; mix it in the milk first then add to the snow.

This was fantastic--and my kids were able to help me every step of the way.  The picture of the pink scoops with the berries made me think sorbet--so we blended a bag of frozen raspberries with the milk, sugar and vanilla, then mixed that entire mixture with the snow.  It was delicious and totally fun to make!

The key is to add the milk until you are happy with the consistency.  At first it was lumpy but after a little more milk you know it was just right.  Nice with a little Ovaltine or cocoa powder sprinkled on top, maybe some cinnamon.  Might try a little nutmeg next time.

I have had this all my life. It was a rare treat as I grew up in Mississippi and didn't get snow often. I could not believe my husband who is from West Virginia had never heard of it. The first time I made it for his nieces in WV. I used this recipe as  it was the same I had always used, but I added a little blue food coloring to make it pretty as well as tasty.

Snowfall in VA and had to find a snow cream recipe.  This one is yummy!  I used a can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it came out great!  If you are looking for a gourmet-tasting ice cream, this isn't it...but it makes a very good snow cream!  Thanks for posting!

So much fun! Here in maryland we had 43" of snow last year at one time which was way more than we were used to! After a few days, the roommate and I made a journey and walked to the grocery store so we could make this! A lot of fun and great memories!

We just had 12 inches of snow (doesn't happen often in Texas) so we made this for the first time. It tasted just like homemade ice cream. Hopefully we can make it again next year.

Very good, traditional recipe ingredients from my childhood.  It isn't ice cream, it's snow cream.  But for those expecting a little more, substitute half & half for milk and pre-mix sugar (or powdered sugar even better) and vanilla in that prior to fluffing into the snow.

Here in Alabama we rarely get the type of snow needed for this.  We always made this when I was younger, and now for 3 years in a row I have been able to enjoy snow cream again!  Today, I didn't have milk so I used half & half and it was still delicious

Hey try 1cp milk and 1 cup of liquid vanilla coffer creamer and I tried vanilla butternut flavoring and it is great! Turned it yellow but still was good. We also add 1 whole egg to ours. Have been making it for years. We mix all the liquid with the sugar real good first and then add the snow last.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit I had to look up a recipe for snowcream...   But I appreciate this being available. I only did half the sugar and wished I had done even less. Maybe our snow was a lot fluffier than Lil'MadSavy's. Anyway, I appreciate the help. My kids LOVED it (Had to instruct my 6 yr old that, no, we don't lick the kitchen floor - ever! Even if your snowcream does drip a little on it. Eww!)

I just made this for my family and we enjoyed it. I noticed that some said the sugar makes it gritty. I recommend running the sugar and milk through the blender first to break up the sugar. True it was not very creamy as in texture but it was creamy and sweet in taste. My sister in law uses sweetened condensed milk and it is very creamy, in texture, and sweet.

This was really good!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I used 2 Tbsp. of vanilla instead of 1.  I also used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup of 2% milk as opposed to the 2 cups of milk that the original recipe called for.  I mixed the 2 kinds of milk together before pouring over the snow mixed with sugar and vanilla.  It turned out great!  You gotta love getting a foot of snow in April so you can make this!

We always called this snow cream, and it was a great treat for me as a kid since, living in Missippi, we didn't get a chance to make it often.  I loved it, and it's still a treat to this day. But since I live in Wisconsin now, I have the occasion to make it more often!  I use superfine sugar in mine and 1 % milk with a splash of half-n-half.

This is such a fun and easy treat for the kids! I had better luck when I made it in smaller batches. I added the milk gradually in very small amounts until I got it just the way I wanted it. Very yummy!

This was fun to do.  Being we are sick of snow, and the sight of it made the kids mad, it was a nice thing to try to make smiles.  They did not care for it as much as I thought they would, but I will experiment some more with it.  They all asked to make it again, trying different flavors.  My daughter wants to try strawberry milk with hers.  Thanks for the fun and smiles! - Cindy

Wow, I guess I thought my family was the only ones who really made this! Most people you know have never heard of it. When I went to put it in my recipe book, I googled it-dang! We would not have been able to wait for snow to fill up a gallon though! We would just go out, after a few inches of freshly fallen snow, and use the largest bowl we could find and heap it full of clean snow. We used evaporated milk (unless all we had was regular milk) and sometimes half evaporated milk and half regular. Sometimes we didn't have vanilla and it's good without it too. We never premixed ingredients-we loved the crunchiness of the granulated sugar-well, what kid doesn't?! Just sprinkle sugar across top (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup), add vanilla (we did 1/2 to 1 tsp per large bowl), and stir in milk to get the consistency you want! Never tried to change it up-it was perfect the way it is! Very sweet, very rich! Grab a bowl and a warm blanket and enjoy! You can try this in a small bowl first-just a dash of sugar, vanilla, and milk to see if you like it!

We make this, but to avoid the sugar being gritty we use confectioners sugar.  Also the vanilla mixes in better if you mix it in with the first cup of milk, or better yet start with 1 cup of heavy cream to make it more decadent.

Haven't had snow ice cream since I was a kid.  This is just how I remembered it!  While the texture naturally isn't quite like real ice cream the flavor is!.

I loved making this with the kids tonight! This isn't a gourmet ice cream, this is definitely about having some winter time fun with the kids! And they loved it too!
My only thought for next time is to warm the milk a bit to fully dissolve the sugar, and then re-chill the milk/sugar mixture. I think that may help the gritty texture from the cane sugar while eating the "ice cream".

yum!  I love snow cream.  We most certainly had it in VA where I grew up, my mom made it all the time and we couldn't wait for snow so we could have it!  Of course now I live in San Diego, so I guess snow cream is out, lol!

I've made snow ice cream with my girls for years.  We only make it when there's a "quiet snow".  This usually happens at night.  The snow is very light and fluffy and clean. I beat 1 c. milk, 1/2 c. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla & 1 egg in a large bowl, then add snow until it's all absorbed.  Needs to be eaten immediately.  The egg makes it taste more like homemade ice cream.

Made it last night for the first time and I think this will become a fun tradition in my house! I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk. Also, I mixed the milk, sugar, and vanilla together before adding the snow. It was great and more importantly fun!

It was OK, but a little to sweet for my family. Also, if you want it to taste like chocolate, you can put in a few spoonfuls of hot-coco powder.

I have never made snow cream (never even had it) before and when we got a TON of snow today I decided to try it out. I found this recipe and used heavy cream (I didn't have any milk) and it was absolutely delicious. My husband, 2 year old daughter, and I bundled up and went outside to make it and then play in the snow. This is definitely a tradition I'd like to start! Thanks.

I've never heard it called Snow Ice Cream. Where I'm from (N Alabama/ S Tennessee) we always called it Snow Cream. I love making this everytime it snows (which isn't often) I did discover this year we had a dry powdery snow and it would just not cream, it either stayed powdery and refuse to blend or it would give up and melt. If your like me and usually miss when it starts snowing, I just take my bowl and take the top layer of snow off walls and car hoods where I can see nothing has disturbed the snow. Down here where snow is rare snow cream is one of the few things that make snow in the south extra special.  P. S. Mayfield Ice Cream company now makes a really close store bought version of this for those of you wanting to try it and either having germ issues or just no snow.

Wow! Bring back memories!  Yummy!  I did heat up my half & half (instead of milk), sugar and vanilla just until sugar melted; then set outside to cool.  My kids were amazed at their "talented" mom!

In south Mississippi we don't get much snow but every time it does I make snow ice cream just like this. I like that it doesn't have raw eggs and my girls absolutely love it!!! I may try some additional ingredients for flavor this time around since we have gotten around 6 inches of snow! Yay!!

So easy and good.  I liked that it used milk instead of cream or Condensed milk - since I'm more likely to have milk on hand at all times.

I thought it was fine!  I made it with my kids today.  I used skim milk, don't know if that makes a difference, but I ended up using 3 cups of milk instead of 2 and I added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla.  It may not have needed it, but I think I had a tad over the 1 gallon of snow it called for.  Great!

I remember snow ice cream.  We didn't have a lot of money and it was such a treat for us.  My mom always added a good dash of nutmeg to the mix.

Thank you...I had a wonderful time mixing this with my four year-old.  As we mixed it, I told her stories of when my own mother made snow ice-cream for me.  I USED Fat free half and half and a bit of skim milk and splenda.  I am on the South beach Diet and this really took care of my cravings for ice cream!

A complete blast from the past! We made this growing up in OK. Not much snow here in coastal VA but when it comes down, this is a wonderful and easy treat to bring some of the outside fun indoors!

Tasty, easy, and fun to make. I just made this with my kids for the first time. It's not as creamy as "real" ice cream, but so much faster to make. Everybody enjoyed it. My kids asked if we could make it again. Adding a little chocolate syrup would easily turn this into chocolate ice cream. A fun activity for a snow day.

My kids and I LOVED this recipe!  The key is to watch how much milk you put in so it is not too wet.  Mine appeared to be pretty dry still, but as you stir all the ingredients up and it begins to melt a bit, it works out perfectly.  I also used Superfine sugar (you can find that in the baking aisle in a box) because some reviewers mentioned the texture of the sugar made it gritty.  We will definitely be making this again the next time it snows.  New family tradition for sure!!!

I made a lot less of it (hubby didn't want to try it and it was only me), so I added the ingredients little by little to about a cup of snow, watching the consistency and sweetness. Was surprisingly yummy!

Don't get the "first fall" of the snow, let it come down for a little bit before you collect it. I found that it had a lot of dirt and contaminates in it. I followed this recipe except I used a can of evaporated milk. Probably a little more vanilla than called for but it was awesome! My grandson added cocoa powder to his and after tasting it, it too was awesome. Because he had to stir to dissolve the cocoa though, his was more of the consistency of chocolate milk. Great recipe though.

This is the classic snow cream I grew up with! Tip: Mix your milk, vanilla, and sugar in a separate container very well before adding it to the snow. This helps cut down on the gritty sugar and incorporates the flavors better. You can also use chocolate or strawberry milk instead of the white milk. Oh and don't forget the sprinkles!!

Amazing!  We added 2 teaspoons of cocoa like another person suggested and it tastes so good.  We just were in a chocolate eating mood :)  Can't wait to make the original recipe.  This was so easy and perfectly sweet.

Just like I remember from when I was a kid....I didn't really measure any of the ingredients.  I just added some of each until it seemed right.

Just what I was looking for!  The recipe we used when I was little had eggs, but I didn't want to get that complicated now.  Be fexible on the amount of snow, and just until its the texture you want.  IF you add too much, add a little milk.  Very easy to adjust, and tasted just like homemade ice cream.

We love it!!! I made it today (we got 8.5 inches of snow) for my sick baby girl's throat and she loved it. I was able to make it allergy free, which is the best. used soy milk, already had vanilla, and it was prefect.

Exactly like we made it when I was a kid. No, it's not like ice cream. That's kinda the point. It is simple, yummy and fun. Kids think it's so awesome to eat "ice cream" made out of snow. It's more like a vanilla shake IMO, but worth a try. My aunt used an electric mixer and that gives it a different taste for some reason. I like it hand stirred, but try it both ways.

We have had more than 3 feet of snow in the past week so I had to do something to help get rid of it. Snow ice cream to the rescue! Lots of fun and pretty yummy to eat. We packed the leftovers in a plastic tub and put it in the freezer. It's not too bad the next day either. I pour a little maple syrup on mine.

We made this with Almond Milk (Regular) and it was delicious! It made it a little sweeter and gave it a slight almond taste. So good and so easy. Lots of fun for the kids and me!

More about the fun than the taste!  However, we thought it was quite tasty with chocolate syrup.  My kids had a great time making this, and made our day cooped up in the house even more fun!  Thank you for sharing!

Great!  Had 4" of snow last night, so I found this just in time.  The kids loved it and reminded dh of growing up.  Next time I may try powdered sugar as it was a little gritty.  Regardless, it was wonderful!  Thanks!!!

It’s an okay recipe but you have to make sure you refrigerate the ice cream once you’re done adding the sugar, milk, etc or else it doesn’t turn out.

Fun and very easy.  My 3 yr old thought this was the "best ice cream" lol It really was pretty good, we each had a bowl.  I reduced this recipe for 2 servings.  Before I went out to gather clean snow, I whisked together the milk, sugar and vanilla until well mixed and a little frothy.  With a plastic rice scooper, I scooped snow into a plastic 8 cup measure bowl with my 4 cups needed.  Then used the scoop to mix the milk mixture into the snow.  No lumps, just smooth snowy ice cream.  Great use of a snow day and making memories as I remember my mom doing with me.

We love making snow ice cream in the winter, but I've always made it with condensed milk.  I didn't have any on hand, so I came across this recipe. It was really good...we even cut it into 1/4 of the original recipe due to the amount of snow we had.  Easy to do and was a hit with our kiddos.  
**One tip...be sure to pack the snow when you measure it.  That way it will be a good consistency when you mix the other ingredients.

Instead of sugar and milk , try condensed milk for smoother consistency and whatever extract for flavor. Add mochi and fruits (mango or strawberries) for added texture.

As I don't live on the East Coast, we didn't have access to the freshest snow this winter. We used some from out back of the house that was a little yellow, from what, we don't know. Anyway, it had a little extra zesty flavor to it that we haven't tasted before and didn't anticipate.

My family tried this for the first time today.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar with 1TBS of vanilla and the snow cream was still very sweet.  I wish I had some coconut  and rum, as suggested by Jonine, another rater, and condensed milk.  The coconut and condensed milk would add more texture.  The current recipe is too icey and melts really fast.  It was fun trying this with my family, and we look forward to trying variations of this recipe.

This recipe is different because its not really based on taste, It's just suppose to just be a happy, fun thing to do with your friends and family. But it does taste good. :) A family favorite ingredient that I recommend is maple syrup, you could also try adding the peppermint for a minty sweet tang. Oh and a hint for people who said that it melted to fast, tried actually making and eating it outside, it makes it really fun, and doesn't melt!

Actually really yummy!  My 2 year old loved it :)

I only used 1/3 cup of sugar and about a cup of milk, and it came out nice.  Kind of like a vanilla sorbet,

I 100% LOVED this recipe! The consistency was almost like a shake. The kids loved it too. I made a special batch with Splenda instead of sugar and heavy cream instead of milk for me...low carb deliciousness! For our next batch we're going to add broken Oreos. Thanks so much for this recipe!

It took a little bit more milk to get it to look like ice cream, but it tasted delicious. Incredibly simple and so enjoyable. Great way to spend the snow-day with my family. Thanks

Made this with my girls today. It was VERY easy and good. We added cinnamon and extra vanilla, and it was YUMMY! Also added a little bit more milk to make it creamy. This will become a tradition in our house when it snows.

Very fun, tasted pretty good.  More of a slushy texture than ice cream, but we liked it!  Might try it with juices next time, I think it would be like a sno-cone

This was good. I made chocolate milk to pour in instead of regular, and it made chocolate ice cream. It was more like a snow slushie because it melted a bit. But overall, it was good.

We added cinnamon to ours to give added flavor. Also, it would have been nice and creamy if we had added heavy whipping cream to the ingredients. Otherwise a fun way to enjoy the blizzard!~

Taste was O.K., but I had to dig down to the bottom, where all of the milk & vanilla sank to.  It was gritty, the sugar doesn't dissolve. I will not be making this again.
