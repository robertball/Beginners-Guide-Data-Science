Simple and great recipe as is. Want to improve the flavor throughout the fish?  Either make a parchment or tinfoil bag to seal everything up in.  The juices steam through the fish continuously, keeping it more tender and letting the flavors soak through.

Very delicious and simple recipe. Loved it. I did rub the olive oil on the fish, added a bit of lemon juice, and then added salt pepper and garlic before adding the fresh herbs and lemon. So good. Very impressed.

This turned out great.  I made a few minor changes.  I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and brushed the fish with olive oil.  I used crushed rosemary on it rather than fresh (I knew the fresh would smell delicious but was afraid it wouldn't add enough flavor) and drizzled on a tiny bit more oil.  I then sprinkled 2 tablespoons of white wine on it.  It was very light and flavorful!

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner as suggested by the Allrecipes Newsletter. It turned out wonderful! The flavors were amazing and complimented eachother well. In addition to using extra virgin olive oil I also added some garlic & oregano flavored olive oil. I highly recommend this recipe and hope to make it again soon.

This was excellent!  I thought that 20 minutes was a bit much for the thickness of my fillet, so I used the 10 minutes per inch of thickness rule and then just checked it until it was done.

My husband loved this recipe.  I did marinate it in white wine, and put sea salt and fresh ground pepper on the iron skillet  before putting the salmon on.  Drizzled olive oil as well.  Served it over wilted spinach and yukon gold potatoes.

Make sure you coat the salmon evenly with lemon and rosemary.  Otherwise the taste of the salmon will range widely from one part of the salmon cut to another.  Parts topped with lemon slices were a little too lemony/sour while the parts that weren't had a very strong fish taste...

Very good! I squeezed extra fresh lemon on the salmon, because I didn't think just placing the slices around the lemon gave it enough lemon flavor. Will make again!

This is a wonderful recipe--the ingredients don't overpower the delicate taste of the salmon and so easy to make.  I would gently rub olive oil into the salmon filet prior to adding the spices and lemon slices to keep the meat moist.  The recipe is also delicious with fresh dill in lieu of the rosemary.  Elegant meal!

It may be just me, but I thought that the rosemary was entirely too overpowering.  Furthermore, I think that I sliced my lemon too thick because I ended up removing the top ones to finish cooking the salmon all the way.

Good recipe. I agree with others that the rosemary probably should be reduced a bit. The bitterness some complain about comes from the resin in the stalks, not from the rosemary itself. To reduce that, strip the rosemary off the stalk (turn opposite direction to way they grow and rub hand over them). You get the taste of the rosemary without so much bitterness. This is a good recipe to add to: garlic or onions for instance.

I cut big circles of parchment paper, laid down a bed of sliced onions, topped with garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a rosemary sprig and topped with salmon marinated in Lemon Pepper marinade, more sliced garlic, lemon slices and another rosemary sprig, and folded the pouches together to make a pocket. This was fantastic. My boyfriend said it was absolutely the best salmon he had ever had. I love to cook, and this recipe is a keeper!

This was excellent! and so easy to put together! I served it with wild/brown rice mix and steamed broccoli.  I did lightly rub Olive Oil all over the fish prior to arranging the lemon slices / rosemary sprigs, also added fresh ground pepper and teesny bit of salt....this had a fantastic lemon flavour that carried right through the fish - no need to squirt lemon juice on when it's done! Thanks for the recipe - it's a definite keeper!

Tasty, simple, and a beautiful looking dish. 
We pan seared the leftovers the next evening and it was fabulous, the flavors made more of an appearance.  It was probably one of the best experiences I've had with salmon.  I really dig the simplicity.  Thanks Cheddar.

Excellent recipe! I marinated the salmon in  a little olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and rosemary before doing the rest, and it turned out great!

made this for a lunch party, placed the salmon in a baking platter, added the rosemary and lime (didnt have lemons) sprinkled salt and black pepper on top as well as olive oil. Realised that I had some remaining white wine so I sprinkled some on top too.  Baked for 15 mins at 350F. and the salmon came out perfect! I got rave reviews, and it was the first item to finish!

This was a hit with my 12 year old picky eater.  She devoured the salmon filet.  After reading other reviews I did as some suggested by brushing the olive oil on the fish and removing the leaves of the rosemary from the stem.  I also baked the filet for 20 min in a sealed foil wrap so the fish cooked in its own juices.  The picky eater put her request in last night to have this again tonight.

One of the other reviews suggested to marinate the salmon with garlic, rosemary spings, lemon juice and olive oil. I did just that and I did not like how it turned out. The lemon was overpowering the other flavors in dish. Maybe if I followed the inital instructions it may have turned out better.

This was a very simple, but tasty, meal.  I made very few changes to this.  I added some lemon juice over the salmon before seasoning with both salt and black pepper.  Other than that I made this exactly as it was written.  I will definitely be adding this into my regular recipe rotation!!

I grilled the salmon on cedar planks with no problem. This was a quick and very good recipe that doesn't take away from the salmon's natural flavor. I added a little brown sugar on top of the salmon before adding the rosemarry and lemon, gave it a nice glaze on top with some added sweetness.

This was fantastic! I added garlic salt though (couldn't possibly leave that out!). I also baked it in an 8x8 glass dish and around the salmon, placed baby asparagus. I drizzled the asparagus in the same ingredients as the salmon, adding lemon juice and a little black pepper... I let it all bake together and it was AMAZING! I served the salmon on a bed of white rice. The hubby was a very happy man with this recipe. Plus, it looks great on the plate! I will definitely make again!

Very good presentation, but I was disappointed with the flavor. It looked great, but tasted pretty average. Also, be careful - the smell of baking rosemary is not the most appetizing for *some* people.

This was pretty good.  Nice and light, which I was looking for.  Served with roasted broccoli.  Would make again, though would add something to it...maybe a little different spice or something!  Thanks!

This is a very nice recipe and simple to prepare.  I was disappointed the lack of lemon flavor, though.  Next time I will just buy an extra lemon to squeeze over after cooking.  For me, cooked lemon is not strong enough to balance with the rosemary.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, with its simple, clean flavors.

This was good! Fresh lemons and rosemary go wonderful together with the fish. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought the salt should be ommited(since salmon is salty to begin with) and could use some fresh ground black pepper. All in all my family enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I do not like salmon, typically.  I have tried all kinds of recipes and I have even ordered it in restaurants before (to see if it was me that was making it taste bad) but I haven't liked it.  This made me change my mind about Salmon. Make this recipe ASAP!!

this recipe is great! i added a little bit of garlic to it, a little more rosemary and i rubbed the fillets with oil instead of drizzling. Light and flavorful!

Simple and easy! I also added sliced garlic on top of the salmon, a splash of white wine and salt and pepper. Came out perfect. My husband who is not usually keen on fish also liked it! Served it with stir-fry broccoli and sweet potato chips.

I added cut 2" yukon potatoes and asparagus in the dish.  Looked great but the taste just was not there. Seem to dry out quite a bit.

I'm sorry but I really didn't care too much for this. I think it was too lightly infused for my taste. Everyone else liked it though.

Delicious taste but I made 5 thick pieces of salmon for 20 mins on 400F and they were way too dry.  I'll try it again on 375F and for 15 mins.

Had the in-laws over for dinner and tried this recipe out and everyone loved it! I'm a fan of rosemary, so I put four or five sprigs of rosemary underneath the fillet and then finely chopped two more sprigs, mixed it with the olive oil and sea salt and then spread that on top of the fillet. Will definitely be making this recipe several times over.

This is easy, fresh, healthy and delicious.  What more could you ask for? The only changes I made where to add some fresh ground black pepper and to cover the baking dish to lock in all the flavors.

I admit I have never followed this recipe exactly, as I have always used DILL instead of rosemary, but it is my staple and I have used this recipe MANY times (to the joy of myself and my friends).  The one thing you might want to watch out for is going too crazy on the lemons because the peels can make the salmon a bit too tart.

Followed the recipe to the tee. One minor addition: listen to the others and place the salmon in a foil bag. Keeps it juicy!

This is by far the simplest recipe to follow with the most phenomenal results that I have found on this or any other recipe website. I did follow other users suggestions and wrapped the salmon in tinfoil before baking. I also coated both sides of the filets with salt and pepper and used dried rosemary and packaged lemon juice (as that is what I had handy). I also piled on canned minced garlic. This came out so delicious and the smell is intoxicating!! I will definately use this recipe over and over again!

I made this salmon for dinner tonight and we weren't very impressed with it.  The only change I made was to add some lemon pepper seasoning to the fish and I omitted the olive oil as it's really not necessary in my opinion.  The flavor of the rosemary completely overpowered all the other flavor's (including the fish).  Therefore, we probably won't make it again.

I was concerned about using that much rosemary because of it's pungent aroma, but it lent a very delicate flavor to the salmon. I left the skin on because that's the way I normally serve salmon, but will probably remove the skin like the recipe says next time.

I added kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and lemon juice on top of the salmon before the rosemary and lemon and it turned out great!

I made this for valentine's day as well, and I DO NOT care for fish AT all, but being from Oregon, my husband loves it.  I ate EVERY bite!  It was SOOO good!  I couldn't believe it!  I want more, but it's all gone!  It was absolutely wonderful!  I had to cook it with the skin on, since we didn't have a sharp enough knife to cut it off, so it was a tiny bit fishy tasting near the bottom, but still, WONDERFUL!  I forgot to brush it with the olive oil, like others suggested, I just made it the way the recipe said and it came out PERFECT!  I squeezed some fresh lemon juice over mine when I was eating it.  I actually had forgotten to, until I was about half way done, it was so good that I was totally distracted!
My husband said "PLEASE make this again!".  I WILL!!
THANK YOU for a great recipe that is SO simple and yummy!

A standard in my house. So simple and fresh rosemary is a must. The lemon slices keep the filets juicy. We make it over and over (and over) again.

for those of you who think rosemary overpowers the salmon, I would use Tarragon instead. I have a recipe 4 oz of white wine and 4 oz of water. Set salmon on lemon slices in the bottom of non stick pan. Place salmon in pan and sprinkle with tarragon. Cover and slowly steam until flaky. (usually about 6 or 8 min).  This is even fantastic cold for salad or a buffet.  We eat this about 2 times per month.

Instead of a lemon, I used an orange (didn't have lemons) and dried rosemary.  Gave it a sweeter yet mellow flavor.  Paired it with coconut rice and a side of veggies.  Delicious! Even my husband, who doesn't eat fish, loved it!

I even added salt and pepper to the fish before adding the rosemary and it was still pretty bland.  The rosemary didn't come through like I was hoping.  For the cook time 20 minutes at 400 is to long for 2 fish much less I cooked 4 fish and took out at about 18 minutes and they were super dry.  Sorry but this is a 2 star recipe and I probably won't try again.

This is so good.  I did alter a little by grinding up the Rosemary and sprinkled it on (MY daughter says she hates it, but she loved this recipe) and used lemon zest and juice of a lemon instead of lemon slices. My family loves this dish!

Ten stars, if I could! This recipe just proves how simple ingredients complement eachother to make a delicious dish. I used a salmon filet that weighed a pound, but used just the one lemon and four rosemary sprigs (which I snipped right out of my garden). I didn't use any salt, and didn't miss it at all. I used a foil packet to bake it, and found that I needed about 45 minutes at 400 for it to be done to my liking. The flavors blend so well with the salmon. I always use rosemary for chicken, and never thought to do so with fish. This is a keeper, for sure. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Absolutely perfect the way it is. The rosemary flavour was not overpowering like other reviewers said, and the lemon flavour came through perfectly. Thank you for this romantic dish!

I usually like more saucy stuff on my salmon, but like everyone else said, this was a very good compliment to good salmon. I did squeeze extra lemon on top, plus added a little sherry since I didn't have plain dry white wine. Even my husband loved it, that is hard to please. Will make again. Marcie

This was very good but I think it could use a couple more sprigs of rosemary and another lemon.  I added lemon pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. I did wrap in a foil packet as suggested by others and then cooked for 30 minutes.  Fish was very moist and flaky!

So easy and quick....delicious....be careful...the lemons slow down the cooking a little add about 5to7 minutes to your normal cooking time...dependent on the thickness of your filet.

This was easy and delicious!  I only used sliced lemon on the top (subbed lemon juice on the bottom), and used dried rosemary instead of fresh.  I added garlic powder to the top as well.  Fantastic!

This was an excellent dish with very few ingredients.  The only changes I made was that I baked the salmon in foil packets and I increased the ingredients for a family of four.  My ten year old who is the pickiest eater cleaned his plate.

This is a keeper. Took the rosemary off the stem as to keep away the bitter taste. Followed mostly as written, but sealed it in foil. Flakey & moist in 20  minutes. Did rub the salmon with the olive oil (no drizzle) and added pepper with the salt. And I am not a salmon fan, but will start eating this recipe quite often.

Very easy recipe, fast and VERY delicious.
I used  a little course sea salt and a bit  of freshly ground  pepper on it, and squeezed some lemon juice on it.
The rest i kept exactly the same.
A Healthy and easy recipe that is great.
I will make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

Very moist & flavorful. I made as stated, but wrapped everything in a foil packet as another reviewer had suggested. Cooking time took about 20 minutes longer, but my salmon was not quite thawed yet so it might have affected cooking time. Will make again!

Super yummy!  I will cook the salmon a little less time when I make this again because it was a bit overdone, but otherwise it was perfect.

This has become my absolute favorite way to cook salmon. I don't always have fresh rosemary on hand, but the kind you can buy in a jar works just fine. I often use honey or maple syrup instead of olive oil to sweeten the fish; the kids like it better that way. Also, I find it tastes better with a little pepper and garlic in addition to the salt and rosemary.

This is a very simple recipe that is great for introducing people to salmon. My husband was not a fan of fish in general prior to sampling this recipe. Now, he looks forward to me telling him salmon is for dinner.

This recipe was easy and smelled wonderful, but mine turned out bitter to taste and we had to throw it out.  I'm not sure if it was the rosemary or the lemon rinds; the fish? I don't think it was the fish.

Made this last evening for my husband and I and we were both highly impressed.  We took the advice of some and put olive oil directly on the salmon and we also squeezed lemon over the salmon after it was ready.  We served it with roasted tomatoes and fresh green beans with garlic and it was delicious!  Quick and easy, too!

The rosemary doesn't go with the salmon flavor and the lemon ruins the texture of the fish.  I would never make it again, nor would i ever eat it.

We used fresh copper river salmon,which is usually on the dry side due to its lack of fat.  It had amazing flavor and was very moist.  We added an additional 5 minutes to the cooking time, as it was fairly thick.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe is a home run. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. With just the two of us, I make the full recipe and then wrap the leftovers in parchment and foil so that I can reheat for another meal. Very yummy!

This was really good - I took the advice of a previous post, and did the whole thing in a tinfoil pouch - put a couple sliced of lemon, rosemary springs from the back yard. Rubbed the fish with olive oil, salt and pepper, laid it on top of the herbs then closed up the pouch and put it in the oven - it was tender, flaky and delicious! Served it with a quinoa salad.

Love the simplicity of this recipe!  Used tinfoil pouches in order to seal the flavours in as other reviewers have suggested, easy clean up too!

Cooked this for myself and my lady friend, It went over splendid! Did the EVOO brush as suggested by another user and added cracked pepper along with the salt. cooked 2 dinner sized fillets in the oven following the 10 min per inch rule and it turned out perfect. Served with long grain/wild rice and roasted asparagus.

We very much liked this recipe.  I tweaked it a bit by using aluminum foil for extra tenderness, made an olive oil marinade with rosemary, S&P and garlic, and brushed it on the salmon before the final layering of the lemon slices and rosemary.      Very good!  Definitely cooked longer than 20 min at 400 though.  (That is, I wanted fully cooked fish).  We're keeping this one for sure.

Making salmon couldn't have been easier!  I used two lemons to give it even more flavor and it was delicious and very flavorful.

Probably one of the best recipes on this site! The only thing I ever change is cooking time to accommodate the thickness of my fillets (10 minutes per inch), but other than that everything about this dish is perfect!

This was fantastic. Only change was I broiled my 1 1/2 fillet for 10 minutes 4-5 inches from heat. Made it a little more crispy than baking would have. Fresh rosemary and a lemon, not bottled juice,is key. I like pepper so I added fresh cracked black on top. Thanks so much

I made this last night for a group of friends and family (including kids) and it was a hit! It cooked perfectly per the recipe.  I added some fresh crushed pepper and salt to taste and didn't change anything else.  I highly recommend this recipe. It is soooooo easy to prepare and will make you look like a seasoned chef!

The flavor was just OK.  A little bland.  I also would rather broil my salmon than bake it.  A little mushy.

My family loved this recipe!  It was pretty quick and easy, too!  I used frozen salmon fillets and followed some advice from other reviewers, such as putting the lemon slices on first, then the rosemary, so that you can take it all off at once to eat it.  I mixed a bit of lemon juice and lemon pepper in with the olive oil, and also cooked the fish wrapped in tinfoil.  I'm a big fish fan, especially with lemon.  I loved it, and my family did too!

My favorite way to prepare salmon, it comes out perfect everytime. Bonus is it's a stress-free recipe meaning if I don't have the rosemary, I can use other seasonings and it works just as well.

Nice, simple flavor.  I used foil packets as previously suggested.  I think I overcooked mine a bit though, as they were quite small.  No flavor was overpowering and picky daughter ate it all without being prodded.  Used my fresh rosemary from the garden.

I use the bbq grill. Double wrap the fish in foil, 10 minutes per side. I think the flavor is better with butter, rather than olive oil. I also top the fish with the lemon slices first, then  rosemary sprigs; everything comes off cleanly with no little rosemary leaves clinging to the fish. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I made the mistake of deciding to squeeze lemon on the salmon directly thinking it would need more flavor but it was way too lemon-y.  This time, I followed the directions and it was great. It was a little dry, but I think that was my fault - we were in a hurry and I cranked up the heat and think it became overdone.  The flavor was much better when I followed the recipe - I'll review again once I try it again and don't overcook it!  Light fresh dinner. Served with rice.

I actually haven't tried this myself, but I make this recipe all the time for my daughter who doesn't eat meat when the rest of the family is in the mood for pork or beef.  So easy to wrap a salmon filet in foil with the lemon and rosemary and bake along side anything else in the oven -- I've even made it on the grill.  She loves it, and I am so happy to have this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic. I expected it to be a bit bland, given how few ingredients/spices are used, but wow, it was far from it. I prepared and baked exactly as directed, and it was delicious. Incredibly quick and easy to make. A real winner.

I thought this was just ok. I also used some garlic salt as other cooks suggested, and I can't imagine the dish without it. I am not sure that I will make this again. I think I prefer my salmon with dill rather then the rosemary.

Wonderful and Easy!
I didn't have any rosemary and some reviewers said it left a bitter taste, so I used sage, taragon, garlic and basil instead. Worked fabulously!

This is one of my very favorite recipes ever! I have used frozen salmon filets with great success- one of my guests said he usually did not eat salmon, but he ate this one! I also used fresh salmon, left the skin on, and used dried rosemary and emeril's essence spice (salt, red pepper, etc.) and it was delicious!! This is a super-quick supper and husband- pleasing too!

This was soo good!  I'm not a huge fan of salmon but my boyfriend loves it.  When I prepared it this way, I couldn't get enough.  The only thing I changed was Lemon Pepper Seasoning on top of the salmon instead of the salt.  I recommend this to everyone I know!

Love it, easy to make (even for a guy) a little harder to do in a BBQ then in an oven and it takes a lot longer in the BBQ. However  on a ceader pland its friggin awesome!

I liked this, but my husband did not, hence the 3 stars. He didn't like that you couldn't taste the fish at all, only the lemon and rosemary. I did not find the lemon and rosemary overpowering(except perhaps the smell). It would be a good recipe for someone who is not a big fan of fish flavor, but if you want the wonderful flavor to come through, I would not reccommend this one.

My fiance and I made this with soy-sesame asparagus and rice pilaf. I loved the salmon but thought the rosemary was a bit too bitter; that may be our fault as we used our own from our garden. My fiance thought the lemon was overpowering, but I didn't agree. We both loved it and will definitely make this easy and delicious dish again.

One of the easiest ways to fix salmon.  It stays moist and the citrus is a nice flavor.  We've tried it with oranges, too, and it was just as yummy.  Very good recipe.

This recipe was kind of a let down, because it go so many great reviews....it was way too lemony for me....next time I'll make it w/just the herbs and leave the lemon as an individual option.

This was the first salmon dish I'd ever cooked and I was impressed at how well it turned out.  The lemons practically melt as you cut into them and this blends perfectly with the salmon.  It is also not a heavy or oily dish.  I served this with a potato salad (kipfer potatoes, 3 kinds of green peas and a dressing of seeded mustard, red wine vinegar, crushed garlic and olive oil).

This recipe is delicious!  Ok, so I used mahi mahi because I didnt have salmon, but did everything else the same.  The flavor was mild, but elegant.  I love the fragrance of rosemary baking in my oven.  This meal presented very well with steamed broccoli.  A simple gourmet recipe that is simple to do and quick too!

Made this for our Valentine dinner tonight.  It was a big time hit - my husband was WOWED! (a keeper for sure, husband too :). I pretty much followed the recipe as is.  One reviewer suggested rubbing the salmon gently with olive oil to keep it moist - I did do that, and it was perfect.  The rosemary and lemon compliment the salmon very nicely.  The meal was so elegant, and yet so easy. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

Terrific, tasty, super-easy recipe for salmon fillets! As mentioned in the comments, I used aluminum foil to make a tent for the fish in the oven, which I felt helped permeate the flavors throughout the salmon and kept it moist. I also loved snipping the sprigs of rosemary from my roof deck garden.

Great recipe!  Delicious, we loved it.  The ingredients were ones I had on hand (rosemary in my garden) which was especially good that night since I did not have something for my previously favorite salmon recipe. simple and easy too.

Delicious! I generally baked at 425 for about 13-15 minutes depending on the size of the fish, checking every minute after 13 minutes to ensure that it remains moist and medium rare.

THIS IS GOOD,but I find rosemary a bit strong for fish.  My son makes the best salmon ever on a cedar plank on the bbq.  He uses butter, dill and lemon sliced very thin, sometimes a splash of white wine or champagne that we will be drinking with the meal.  Sides are usually grilled asparagus and rice or double stuffed potatoes.  This is my choice of last meal in my life,

The recipe was okay. I subbed fish sticks for salmon and instead of baking, I fried them in lard. I added some lemon to some dip I had and used that forna dipping sauce.

This is so simple, but don't change a thing. It's perfect, and it tastes like you worked WAY harder than you actually did. It's an easy win. I left the skin on my salmon because I was feeling even lazier, and it was still great, so don't worry too much about that.

It was easy for a first time to make salmon.  But not a whole lot of flavor and the lemon rinds gave some spots a bitter taste.

I used Olive Oil spray, seasoned the fish with Mc Cormick Lemon Herb and baked it about 23 minutes - thought I died and went to heaven!  For an extra treat, I use Meyer lemons instead of regular ones.

Wonderful! I made my first salmon with this as a guide and it was so tasty! What I did differently though was that I put a lot more rosemary, and put it in the oven at 375 for 10 extra minutes.

I made this as written.  It was moist and flavorful and the most delicious salmon.  Made with broccoli cheese rice and a small amount of couscous mixed in and steamed fresh broccoli.  A great dinner for a Tuesday night.  Another house favorite.

This was absolutely delicious! I've just started the Whole30 diet and I wasn't sure what I wanted to have for dinner so I googled a recipe and found this one. I honestly love how simple and easy it is to make! Just add some vegetables and this becomes a whole meal! I look forward to making it again soon!

It tasted delicious! However, it definitely took longer than 20 minutes. It took closer to 30/35 because my fillet was pretty thick. Great recipe though. Also I used more oil than it said to

Was a little dry. Next time I am going to use foil, shorten the cooking time, and also chop up some rosemary to put directly on the fish as it didn't get much rosemary flavor with just the sprigs.

perfection!  I've made this several times now and it is still perfect!    I added a bit of olive oil one time and it came out a bit too oily.   I do add some lemon pepper to just one side but other than that I use the recipe as posted.

Easy but a bit plain. I had to add lemon pepper seasoning to add any flavor. It smelled good while cooking but was very disappointing once we plated. Might be good with the lemon butter recipe I use for trout but tonight's dinner was pretty meh.

Delicious! I had dried rosemary from my garden and I added garlic. The baked lemon squeezed over the fish was a nice touch. I did what others suggested and put olive oil on the fish before the herbs , lemon and garlic. I will make this again.

Really great recipe. Simple and easy, served it with roasted rosemary red potatoes with lemon from the fish over them great and healthy combo. I recommend serving as the lemons on the plate so when you cut into the fish you get some extra lemon juice.

Easy to make, but for us this tasted rather bland. We followed the recipe as is, but it was lacking in flavor for us.  Also, the underside of the salmon fillets tasted too lemony, while the top was not. Perhaps this occurs from steaming on top of the lemons -- not sure. Cooking time may vary depending on fillet size. We did not have issues with the salmon coming out dry nor did we think the Rosemary was overpowering. Guess this recipe just wasn't for us...just seemed to be missing something -- garlic, onion, etc.

Made 10/15 for Ray. Excellent. Sprayed salmon w EVOO Pam. Spread minced garlic on salmon. Used lots of lemon slices and rosemary and sprayed with EVOO Pam again.  Next time spray the rosemary with Pam after being placed on top of salmon to preserve during cooking for better presentation. Rosemary dried during baking. Or garnish with fresh lemon and rosemary after baking for presentation.  Taste of lemon, rosemary, garlic delicious. Served w asparagus and sweet potato. Ray liked but didn't taste Rosemary though multiple sprigs placed to cover entire top of salmon!

Absolutely loved this recipe! It was really easy & the fish soaked up the lemon & rosemary flavor, had lots of moisture, and was perfectly cooked in my glass baking dish. I will definitely use this recipe again! I used fresh salmon steaks.

A tasty, light, but flavorful way to prepare salmon. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I made it with dried rosemary and it was just great. I served it with homemade tarter sauce, but it would have been just as well received on its own.

I prepared this on a (direct) low charcoal grill did not remove the skin and only put the lemon under the filets...not the rosemary.   I did put the lemon and rosemary on top as in the recipe.  Grilled for 15-20 minutes and it was fabulous!

This was delicious, quick, and easy.  I made it in foil packets, as someone else's suggestion.  I let some crushed garlic sit in some extra virgin olive oil, then used that on both sides of each piece.  I also squeezed some fresh lemon juice over each piece before wrapping the packet.  The only negative was a bit of bitter taste, not sure if it was from the lemon's pith or the woody rosemary stems.  I may try dill in the future as well.

This was a very nice (and easy) way to prepared salmon.  I made a foil packet to seal in the lemon and rosemary flavors, but otherwise prepared as directed. The lemon & rosemary definitely permeated the entire fillet, but it was delicate - not overpowering at all. Definitely nice flavors to complement the salmon, not compete with it.

A quick and tasty fish dish!  I cooked the fish in foil packets per reviews.   I added lemon juice and seasoned the fillets with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes.

This was great!!  Very easy yet tasty.
We used salmon fillet with the skin so no need for olive oil.  Used lemon pepper but thought still needed more regular pepper.  So next time that's what we'll do.

I would give this a one star because my husband complained so much about it, however that was my fault.  I added garlic which is a no-no in his book.  Plus, instead of rosemary I put fresh dill...therefore I am giving this recipe 4 stars because the texture of the fish was so perfect and I am sure if I omit the garlic it would be a winner in his book too, as he loves the flavour of the fish if it isn't overpowered by garlic.  I don't like giving less stars if I change the recipe too much.

Excellent and so easy!  Based on other reviewers, I also added some pepper, lemon juice and minced garlic on top of the fish before adding the last layer of lemon slices.  I also baked 5 mins longer than the recipe called for - the result was fabulous!  It looks so elegant with the spices and lemon - I served it over brown rice with some mixed veggies.  Even the kids enjoyed it!  Will definitely make again!

My husband and I enjoyed the this recipe. He had salmon and I had to use chicken since I don't like salmon.  I cooked both salmon and chicken in parchment and they both came out fabulously moist and tender per another reviewer's suggestion.  I will definitely make this again.

Simple and wonderful flavors that came together in a flash! I served it on top of a spinach salad with a light white wine dressing.  When preparing, I added about a 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of my large pan (the water was not higher then the lemon slices, and didn't touch the fish) in order to "poach" the fish and retain moisture. I also used a rather large fillet and it needed about 30 min in the oven instead of 20.

I made this for my boyfriend for our first Valentines day, and I was nervous that some how I would mess it up. I made the foil bag like one reviewer suggested added a bit more salt and olive oil, and WOW! we both finished all of it, it was such a simple delicious recipe! I highly suggest you make this if your looking for something easy and yummy! ( I served it on top of the liptons instant garlic and herb rice and the flavors complemented each other very well)

My husband l-o-v-e, loves, salmon, and he gets it whenever we eat out, and when i made this for him, he said it's almost the best salmon he's ever had-- it's tied with the one he thinks is best at this restaurant in hollywood. =)  Even I was surprised with how delicious this turned out for being so simple.. Thank you!

I added a dash of balsamic vinegar to the olive oil I rubbed over the salmon. I think next time I'll try marinating it in this mixture for a bit of infusion action.

This recipe is too good! It was super easy, and the tip with using foil to wrap the fillets in was tops! I left the skin on one side of the fillet so it would not stick to the foil, and I had dried Rosemary, also I only put the Rosemary and lemon slices on top. It gave the fish enough of a flavor without being overbearing. GREAT RECIPE!!! A+

Excellent and easy recipe. I follow the instructins exactly and it turns out great every time. I love the lemon flavor and sometimes I omit the Rosemary as everything is so high now in days and it turns out great. I cook with Goya Spanish rice and frozen vegetables. easy meal done in 30 mins.

I had high expectations for this dish.  My wife and I both like Salmon.  Unfortunately, we were both unhappy with the results of this recipe.  We both ate about half of the fish and disgarded the rest.  It was very bland.  The only way we ate what we did was by adding more and more salt and pepper.

I've made this recipe time after time.  This ALWAYS turns out perfect!  It's simple, fast and tasty!  Highly recommended.

I'm adding this to my original review because after making this recipe a couple of dozen times, I realize I much prefer to put the rosemary down first, then lemon, then fish, then lemon, then rosemary.  I like the flavor better, and it helps to keep the fish from drying out.

Also, our fillets come with the skin on one side at the grocery store.  I don't bother taking the skin off.  It does not  detract from the flavor.

I took the other user's suggestions and squeezed lemon juice on the salmon. I also put the E.V.O.O. on the salmon prior to placing the lemon slices on it. My boyfriend and I thought that the lemon taste was too strong and we will just use the slices next time... I also sprinkled rosemary on the salmon underneath the lemon slices and WON'T do that again... bites of rosemary are way too strong! Other than that, I'm not a fish person, but I ate it all and I thought it was very good and the presentation was beautiful. This has now become a weekly meal for us 
;)

Kinda dissapointed, I drizzled lemon juice over the salmon to increase the lemon taste, which ended up great. But the rosemary flavor was incredibly weak- and I used 4 sprigs on each filet (double what is called for). Maybe next time I'll try dried rosemary, but I don't know if I would make this again. If you're looking for an AMAZING salmon recipe check out 'herbed salmon' from this site and look for my review in the ratings.

This has become a family favorite.  I don't make salmon any other way now and I don't change the recipe.  It's perfect just as it is.

I CAN FINALLY COOK FISH! I've never been happy with the fish I cook but this recipe has changed everything. I use sea salt instead of course salt and make it at least once a month. Fresh salmon makes a huge differnece, don't try the individually packaged frozen fillets.

I really like this recipe.  It makes the house smell wonderful, it's easy, and delicious.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  I usually have to use another half lemon to have enough slices to put about two on each fillet.

We thought this was very good.  I had run out of fresh lemons, so I just squeezed some lemon and some lime juice on them.  We grilled them outside on a charcoal grill in a fish basket and they turned out great.  We had two leftover filets so a couple night later I served them shredded in aldredo sauce over noodles.  It was good as well.

My husband normally enjoys salmon served as a cold, main dish but the Lemon Rosemary Salmon recipe changed his mind!  I layered the ingredients as instructed but I let the dish marinate for two days...it was delicious!!

Salmon is one of my favorite fish.  this recipe was simple and delic!  Would work well with most any fish.  I paired this with steaks on the grill for a surf and turf dinner.  Very good!
