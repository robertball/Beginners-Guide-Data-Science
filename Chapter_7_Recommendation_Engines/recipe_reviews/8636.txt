I thought this was absolutely amazing. I did, however, take a few of the suggestions on here. First, I mixed a little garlic powder and adobo to the Parmesan cheese.  I also added a small amount of bread crumbs to give it a little more body. Second...instead of soaking the chicken in salt water to reduce blood that would come out during baking, I decided to par boil them in salt water, cutting down coking time in half, and making the chicken super moist. And I dredged them in flour before I soaked them in the egg and Parmesan cheese, so the coating would stick better. I baked at 400 for only about 25 - 30 minutes, because the chicken was already cooked for the most part, all I needed was the parmesan to darken. The result was absolutely amazing, the Parmesan cheese really came out, and my fiance couldn't believe how good it was.

in response to the person who did not like the blood coming out of the chicken. Soak the chicken in 1/4 cup of salt for at least  an hour, it will draw out the blood.

I am eating a piece of this piping hot chicken as I type this and it is DELICIOUS!!! I work until 11 PM and I was looking for something quick and easy to make this morning for my family to have for dinner and I found this. It is a wonderful recipes. I did make a couple of changes: I also used seasoned breadcrumbs with the Parmesan cheese. I discovered I was out of eggs so I simply coated the chicken in milk and then dredged in the cheese mix. I also added garlic powder and oregano to the cheese mix. These drumsticks came out moist and juice on the inside and cripsy, crunchy on the outside. I thought I would need to cover the pan with foil, but I just kept an eye on them and they browned perfectly!! Very good Anika! I will be making this one again!

Like everything I prepare, I tweaked it a little by adding some garlic powder, onion powder and some flour with the Parmesan cheese.  When I bread chicken I usually don't roll it in a prepared dish of ingredients, I put it all in a ziploc bag and shake it untill the chicken is coated.  It tasted really good and it was super easy to make with readily available ingredients from my kitchen. THX

Awesome recipe! Made a few slight changes...added a bit of milk and a lil salt and pepper to the egg and used the full 2 cups of parmesan but added about 1/2cup bread crumbs and seasoned as suggested in the other reviews with garlic and onion powder. Haven't had much luck with chicken legs in the past but this one is a keeper! Thanks!

Very simple and easy to make.  My 2 yr old devoured it.  Since Parmesan is already salty I had reduced the salt amount.  Next time I'll omit the salt altogether.

My kids hated this. My husband said it was "OK."   The drumsticks were goopy in the baking pan, and the bottom of the chicken was soggy.  I'm going to try it again with chicken breasts on an elevated baking rack (so that the chicken doesn't sit in its own fat while baking). Also, my drumsticks were pretty large, and they required extra cooking time.  Perhaps,  that was part of the problem.  I think the taste was good, but the texture and look of the chicken really turned my family off.

Very good recipe, I used thighs and added oregano for a little more flavor because some reviews said that it was a little bland.

Good recipe! But as is I thought it was a bit bland, so I added some garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the Parmesan mixture for a little extra kick. I also added some Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs for a little extra crispiness. Also, I noticed that after the drumsticks came out the oven, 1) They stuck pretty badly to my baking sheet, and 2) There was dried blood stuck to the ends of the chicken. The first issue was easy to fix, I just spray my baking sheet liberally with cooking spray, but it took some research to figure out the 2nd issue. Finally I tried boiling the drumsticks for 20 min before coating and baking them. The drumsticks came out looking so much better- No icky dried blood! And it cut down on cooking time by about 20 minutes which was nice. This is definitely a great base recipe for you to play around with to your liking!

Delicious!!!  I followed one user's method and par boiled the chicken legs for about 20 min in sea salt and one chicken bouillon cube, let them cool for about 5 min and then rolled them in egg/milk/minced garlic.  I only had 8 chicken legs, so I used 1C grated Parmesan and 1C Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and combined in a gallon size zip-lock with a couple tbsp. extra Italian seasoning and about a tsp. garlic salt.  Baked at 400 for 30 min, turning once.  Incredibly juicy inside and crispy outside and absolutely wonderful flavor!!  Family enjoyed it very much.  Will definitely make this one again soon.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Easy to make and tasty to eat - this is a new family fave! My husband LOVED them and asked for seconds. I enjoyed them as well, mostly because the skin was crispy and the meat was moist.   I made a couple of changes - used 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs and 1 cup of Parm cheese, 1/2 tsp of pepper and salt instead of 1 tsp, and dipped chicken in flour before dipping in the egg mixture. This keeps the bread crumb/cheese coating on the chicken much better!

I LOVE parmesan cheese so I was so happy to do this recipe, but I was disappointed by the results. It was just OK. It was kind of bland. No POW WOW flavor. It was just: Ehhh. I thought maybe I should add more spices, so I did the recipe again another day and it was SLIGHTLY better than before but still not great. I don't think I'm going to waste good chicken with this recipe. I prefer to do the Restaurant Style Buffalo Chicken Wings recipe from this site. I followed the parmesan chicken recipe as stated the FIRST TIME and since I was disappointed by it, I tried it a SECOND TIME BUT I ADDED MORE SPICES and it still was NOT enough to give this recipe another star. I won't make this again.

This was simply fantastic!!  Quick, easy, CHEAP, and to the point.  And I don't even like dark meat!  I actually used chicken thighs that I had in the freezer instead of drumsticks, took off the skin, and they were great.  The coating totally keeps the moistness locked in, and the coating itself is wonderful cooked.  Thanks - great recipe, definitely a keeper, and phenomenal for busy families!

Sometimes I consider a recipe a starting point of which things can be added and enhanced.  How is one person going to create something that my family will all like.  Heck, I can't even always create something from scratch that my whole family will like and I know them.  I liked this recipe and I added my customary things to it:  Wheat flour, garlic powder and a smidge of cayenne pepper.  I out the dry ingredients into a bag and the eggs into another bag.  Also, I added a bit of salt and pepper to the eggs.  I also put the whole thing into the oven and suspended the chicken onto a rack that was perched on top of a roasting pan.  Plenty of air.  The chicken was crispy and it lost some of the grease and was delicious and well recieved.

This was very good.  My picky kids ate it and that says something great about this recipe!  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and parboiled the drumsticks in salty water for 30 minutes. Then after it cooled dredged in flour then egg and then a 1:1 mixture of italian breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.  Cooked it on a wire rack over a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  It was a nice twist on a chicken dish and will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I was not expecting so much flavor for such a simple recipe! I gave a copy of this to my roommate (it was her turn to cook) and she followed the recipe exactly. It's so inexpensive and tasty, we'll be making this one a lot!

Four stars for ease and flavor! This was good. The skin was crispy and yummy, and I usually don't like the skin! I only made half a batch and like many other reviewers, I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and oreagano (about a tsp of each) and I also doubled the salt.  My family loved it. It was a lot like fried chicken to me in terms of flavor and juiciness.  I found that even with halving the coating ingredients, I still had too much.  We will definitely do this again! It was also quick, coming together and going into the oven in less than 15 minutes.

Really good! Added 1 t garlic salt, oregano & onion powder to the Parmesan & pepper. Did not add the salt. Used boneless chicken breasts. Baked for 30 min. Stirred the leftover Parmesan into spaghetti sauce and boiled. Served the chicken on top spaghetti with spaghetti sauce. A keeper.

I made this dish a few weeks ago, it came out great.  All of the ingredients are pretty common to already have on hand, so it's a very convenient supper idea.   I breaded both drumsticks and thighs, so I had to slightly increase the amounts of Parmesan cheese, pepper, and salt.

Tastes great and easy to make!  I added bread crumbs to the mixture.  Also cooked it for the full 45 minutes for 6 large drumsticks.  Will definitely make it again.

I've been trying to find things to make that are budget and health friendly. This one fit the bill and is SUPER easy and doesn't take too long.   The only change I made was to omit the teaspoon of salt and use 2 teaspoons of seasoned meat tenderizer instead. It has salt, garlic, paprika and onion in it.   The chicken came out amazing... Juicy, with a crispy crust. YUM!

This was great! The first time I made it, I only had chicken breasts, and it was so moist. I usually prefer dark meat, and after the first time I used the drumsticks and it was even better, because the dark meat has a much richer flavor.  thanks.

This was a great easy recipe. I boiled the drumsticks first. I added in 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan cheese and 1/2 a cup of Italian breadcrumbs. Like others I also added garlic salt, pepper, oregano and Italian seasoning. I also coated the drums in flour prior to dipping them in the eggs.  My family loved it and we're keeping it in the recipe box.

Excellent!! Because cheese is salty, omit salt and substitute with parsley for color. :)

I made it by recipe and I thought it was bland.  Will try to make one more time, with fresh Parmesan and bread crumbs.

good basic recipe. took others advice. boiled chicken in spices and about 6 shakes of hot sauce for 30 mins. Than dipped the chicken in egg wash. Than coated chicken with 1/2 c each of panko bread crumbs, italian bread crumbs and grated parm cheese. added some coarse salt, fresh ground black pepper, onion poweder, garlic powder and dried parsley. Baked on cooling rack with a cookie sheet. @ 425 for 10 mins than @ 400 for 20 mins. crispy all the way around and moist on the inside. will make again.

I did listen to other reviewers and boil the drumsticks prior to baking to reduce the bloodiness of the drumstick and it worked perfectly!  To give a little extra crunch I added cornmeal to the parmesan the second time I made it.  Thanks for the recipe!

We live in China and I have fun serving new and different meals for our Chinese friends.  I served this for dinner guests and it disappeared!  My guests even took my copy of the recipe home.  The chicken turned out very moist and deliciously crisp.  Next time I will add some fresh chopped garlic or substitute garlic salt for the regular salt to add some zing.  I needed two eggs for the 12 legs.  This is so quick and easy I will make it over and over again!

Absolutely delicious! I did change it around a bit by boiling it so the blood will drain out and i added garlic salt as well. Other than that my family loved it and my mom wants to make it as well! thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

This is the second time I've made this recipe and loved it all over again. This time I took some of the advice posted in the comments, I dredged the chicken in flour before the eggs and added a little bit of breadcrumbs to the cheese. Turned out good but next time I will leave the breadcrumbs out as we liked the more cheesy flavor better the first time round.

A new favorite recipe! It came out so moist and full of flavor!  I combined some suggestions and tweaked it a little.   1.  Parboil for 30 min with salt, abodo, garlic and herb seasoning, and onion powder 2.  Dredge in flour seasoned with a little abodo before dipping into the egg, then the cheese. 3.  Added abodo, garlic powder, parsley and breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture. 4.  Bake for 25 min.

Delicious!  We did dredge the drumsticks in flour before coating in egg then cheese.  Left the recipe as is otherwise.  Could use a few more spices to kick up the flavor a bit, but a very easy, enjoyable recipe regardless.

My fiancee would have given this 10 stars! He kept going "mmmmm" while eating and raving about the flavor of the breading. I did dredge the drumsticks in flour, then into the egg, then into the parmesan cheese mixture. To the 1 cup of parmesan (I halved the recipe), I added 1/4 cup of italian breadcrumbs and about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. This gave it a nice thick, well-seasoned coating. The chicken was SO juicy! I thought it was good, but I just don't enjoy eating meat off the bone, so that kinda killed it for me. Next time I will definitely use boneless chicken breasts and we both will be happy! :) Thank you, I have a feeling I'll be getting this as request often!

Yummy!  Added spices (garlic pwdr, oregano, basil, salt, pepper) as others recommended.  Used chicken breasts (my family has a weird thing about bones) and sprayed them with cooking spray after they were coated to seal in the juices.  I used just parmesan cheese & spices for me (low-carb), but added some breadcrumbs to stretch the breading for the other breasts.  Mine was fabulous and everyone else loved theirs also.  Great recipe and so easy!

Have to give this 4 stars only because I "tweaked" it quite a bit... following the suggestions of other reviewers. Pre boiled the chicken legs 20 minutes. Who knew - made all the difference in the world.
Also started with flour then egg, then the parmesan (of which I added panko and various spices). Baked on a rack for 30 minutes @ 400. Perfect!

I make a different parmesan chicken recipe often, but I like that this uses drumsticks instead of chicken breast, and it is easier than my other recipe. The whole family loved this, especially my little boys! My drumsticks took longer than 45 minutes.

This recipe tastes like fried chicken! I grew allergic to wheat in my 30's. I am always looking for alternatives to the foods I love. (this is also a great low-carb recipe) My husband surprised me with this dish, and I grew nervous thinking he used flour because it tasted so much like fried chicken.  It is super easy and my whole family loved it! I wouldn't change a thing!

Some of the best chicken I have ever made. My son told me "Dad you are the best cooker in the world".  I added the seasoned bread crumbs and some garlic powder. I also soaked the chicken in salt water for an hour.  It finished beautifully.

Wow! This was great! I only changed one thing--I added some garlic powder, thyme, oregano, and onion powder to the cheese. I also cooked them on my broiler pan. I think you need to keep them out of the juices to get the right texture and eliminate the need for bread crumbs.I will make this recipe again and again!

This was the best baked chicken I have ever made... the crunchy outside and moist inside was so great that I almost ate all of it myself.  I followed other user suggestions and mixed one part parmesan cheese and one part Italian seasoned bread crumbs... I tried the recipe again this week with more cheese than breadcrumbs and it didn't have the crunch, so I think I'll stick to the half and half for next time :)

These drumstcks were amazing! This is the first time I have ever wrote a review on this site because my family just thought these were the best. However, I did change one thing I used fresh shredded parmesan that I chopped up fine, it was fantastic....

This is a perfect low-carb recipe so it is an excellent choice for those on South Beach, Atkins, or just a low-sugar diet.  I noticed that a lot of reviewers added breadcrumbs although I cannot fathom why -- the Parmesan cheese & egg created a tasty, crunchy coating.  I am sure that adding cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and/or other spices might add more complexity to the flavor -- the addition of breadcrumbs would only mute the sharpness of the cheese which is one of the best attributes of this recipe.  Here's a tip -- if you use frozen drumsticks, submerge them in lukewarm, salty water for an hour or so.  In this way, you can thaw and brine in a single step.

Took the advice of others and made the following changes:  1 cup parmesan cheese, 1 cup bread crumbs, added garlic powder, oregano and basil.  Everyone loved them and had seconds!!  Thanks for sharing!

Yum!!!  This chicken came out so tasty and crispy.  It actually tasted fried!  I used chicken leg quarters instead of drumsticks and they were delicious.  The only change I really made was to decreast the parm cheese to 1 cup and add one cup of seasoned bread crumbs.  My husband and I both loved this recipe!

I've given this only 3 stars because I basically used the recipe as a spring board for other ideas and went from there. First, I used chicken thighs instead of drumsticks. Then, for the coating, I used minced pecans, bread crums, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, oregano, and cumin. Mixed that and then added the cheese. I floured the chicken, then dipped in the egg and then in the coating. They turned out very good and will do this again next time w/chicken breasts. ...Not sure how the regular recipe would have turned out, though.

Good recipe.  I too reduced the amount of cheese and added garlic powder, fresh rosemary and thyme.  I also baked the legs on a rack to prevent the bottom of them from getting soggy.

I have a very similiar recipe to this that I found years ago in Southern Living, but that recommends adding a mix of garlic and butter near the end of the cooking-drizzling it over top. For those that love garlic, this is a lovely addition.  Either way, both methods are very yummy and easy-easy for busy mums.

Very tasty but a little too cheesy for my taste although my husband thought it was perfect. A nice change from breaded chicken but still very easy to prepare. We have started making this at least once a months but we mix in some breadcrumbs with the cheese.

Wonderful! I doubled the seasonings listed and added two tsp. Onion powder, oregano, garlic powder, and instead of salt used Adobo Criollo seasoning. I added a little bit of unsweetened almond milk to the egg mixture and I parboiled the chicken first.  (This just means boil the chicken in bouillon flavored water for 20 minutes, then prepare as directed and cook for 20 minutes in the oven.) I used the left over seasoned Parmesan mixture to sprinkle over asparagus coated in olive oil, salt and pepper, and cooked those in a separate pan at the same time. While that was cooking, I diced up carrots, celery, and green onions and threw that into the chicken stalk on the stove from parboiling the drumsticks. I served that as a broth soup with the drumsticks, asparagus, and steamed, seasoned broccoli. Fabulous!

Great recipe! My eleven year old daughter made this and it was delicious! My daughter has some recommendations. She would recommend making a little more parmesan cheese, about half a cup more. Also she wouldn't measure the pepper, but still put a nice amount. And last instead of 1 teaspoon of salt do 2 teaspoons and cook the chicken for 45-50 minutes.

Great, healthy, easy recipe. I took a couple of ideas from other reviews like taking the skin off the chicken and shaking the extra cheese/seasoning mix on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven, otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Not only did it make the house smell great while cooking, but it came out nice and juicy with a great crispy layer created by the cheese mix. Definitely adding this to my regularly used recipes.

OMG, This is so delicious! I have to admit, I was worried while I was cooking it because the Parmesean cheese was cooking really fast, but it definitely worked out in the end. It is FANTASTIC!! :D

Delicious! I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and pepper to the parmesan, and omitted the salt. Baked the chicken on a rack to get the skin nice and crispy. It turned out amazingly! This is definitely going into the rotation. :)

Read through reviews and took suggestions of salt on chicken to absorb blood, some dry bread crumbs, garlic salt....and cooked on cooling rack on cookie sheet.  It is one of those 'no fail' recipes.  AMAZING!  Thank you!!!

Delicious!  I did one third part bread crumbs instead of all Parmesan and add 1 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, and a pack of Italian dressing seasoning.  I also used two extra eggs and coated in flour first.  I bake then on racks so they aren't soggy on the bottoms

This chicken recipe is very good. My husband really liked it. I am not crazy about parmesan but this was good. I am going to add a few spices the next time I make it. Thanks for the recipe. It will be a regular in our home.

This recipe was ok. My husband enjoyed it more. Probably because he cooked it. I felt like it lacked something in the way of flavor and spice. This was after we doubled the salt & pepper and added garlic powder. The next day for leftovers was worse. The chicken reheated nicely but had that cheesey odor about it which was a turnoff. I wouldn't make this again and will encourage my husband not to as well.

I didn't add any breadcrumbs like the other reviewers did because we wanted this to be a low-carb recipe (as originally intended).  All I did was add spices -- paprika, garlic, cayenne, and a lot of black pepper.  I thought it was great!

This was a really tasty and super easy recipe. I halved the recipe because I only had 5 drumsticks and I only had apporx 3/4 cup of Parmesan, but even after thoroughly coating each drumstick, I still had quite a bit of cheese left over, so you could easily suffice if you don't have the called for amount of Parmesan.

It was OK. I ended up adding some rosemary and thyme, and I think it added a lot to the dish. Next time I will try adding more pepper or just a tiny pinch of cayenne, as, in my opinion, the dish was amazingly bland for so much parmesan. However, my husband liked it, and even my picky kids ate some. Definitely not a 5 star dish, but it was pretty good for a change!

I usually don't compliment my own cooking but, I couldn't stop 'mmm'ing. I added garlic seasalt and ground italian seasoning to the parmesan after reading some complaints of blandness. This chicken was like a flavor punch in the mouth. (In a good way)

This recipe was ok, but tasted very bland.  I would definetly spice it up more if I tried it again, but it was nice to find a recipe like this using the less expensive drumsticks.

This was very good, but just a little bit bland.  Perhaps some red pepper or something would have added a little bit more flavor?

I enjoyed this recipe, but found it a bit salty.  I will reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. next time.  I also added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. onion powder to the cheese mixture.  Like other reviewers, I, too, had so much coating left over that I ended up throwing a lot away.  I could have coated twice as much chicken.  The meat browned nicely in the 45 minutes, and it was fully cooked in that time, as well. I will try this again with other cuts of chicken.  Great low carb recipe.

I was looking for a quick way to cook drumsticks and came across this recipe.  This is a wonderful recipe!  My picky three year old daughter liked it and so did my husband!  I think it will be one of our family favorites!  Very easy to prepare and super moist and delicious!  I used freshly grated parmesan and romano cheese.  I plan to add garlic next time!  The house spells wonderful when it is baking!  Try it, you won't be sorry!

I have made this dish easily a dozen times now. It is quick, simple and delicious. I cut the amount of cheese to two-thirds of recommended quantity which is ample. More recently, I substituted store bought bread crumbs for one-third of the quantity of cheese I would otherwise use with no diminishment in taste and a more economical dish.

Delicious!  It smells so wonderful while it is cooking...we couldn't wait to eat!  I sprinkled more parmesan over the top when I was done rolling the chicken, just to be sure it was all covered.  A definite keeper.

Really tasty!! Took a bunch of posters comments and did the following: par boiled them for 20 minutes, waited til cool (just took like 5 minuthes), then put flour on them, egg wash, then cheese (which I mixed with a piece of blended toast for bread crumbs, a tsp of oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder) then baked at 400 for 20 minutes....they were not the most amazing thing I have ever tasted which is why I gave it a four..but they were moist and the flavorful...I would for sure recommend to try these!

Came out fine - not fabulous, but almost good enough to be a "go to" when a quick and easy dinner is needed.  Husband didn't like it at all, though, so I guess this one gets relegated to the "won't do that again" file.  While it isn't awful, there are enough good recipes out there hat this one can be skipped.

added garlic powder, italian seasoning, pepper, and panko bread crumbs. crust was great, but after 30 minutes boiling and 30 minutes cooking, cooked too long. Maybe only cook 20 minutes.

I highly suggest using half parmesan and half seasoned bread crumbs- the parm by itself is just too strong.

This is more of a winter time, savory dish. I'll try this recipe again when my taste buds are more in the mood for these flavors because right now it's just okay. The parmesan gives a nutty flavor to the chicken, which was good. The crust is crispy enough to be a healthier alternative to fried chicken.  Like it but don't love it.  We'll see in November.

I really wanted to like this recipe b/c it's so easy to make and drumsticks are cheap!  I followed the recipe exactly but these were not very good at all.  If you change the recipe and use breadcrumbs with the parmesan, maybe it'd be 4 stars, but as written it was way too parmesan-y for us.  We pulled the crust off and just ate the chicken which was pretty much tasteless.  I'd rather just use seasoned breadcrumbs.....

Very good, by two girls liked it.  Made with drumsticks and thighs.  Some had skin and some were skinless.  Next time will use all skinless chicken.  Can use any cut of chicken.  Baked in a pan with a wire rack to keep chicken out of its juices.

This recipe was finger lickin good!! I changed a few things as did others. I first coated my legs in flour (seasoned with salt pepper and adobo) then coated with egg then dipped in Italian bread crumbs which I mixed the cheese into. Baked on 400 for 45 minutes uncovered. My family was silent during dinner! Will def put into rotation!!

Mine turned out half crispy, half soggy, but overall delicious.  I used one cup of parmesan plus a quarter cup of bread crumbs.  Next time I will take another reviewer's advice and elevate my drumsticks onto a rack to avoid the soggy bottoms.

This recipe is came out excellent and was very easy to make. I used half bread crumbs and half cheese and I also followed others advise by placing the cooling rack in cookie sheet.  The chicken turned out very crispy! No need to ever fry chicken again.  A+++++++++

I used thighs instead of drumsticks and cooked it in the Pampered Chef deep covered baker... succulent! And it smelled great cooking. It was very easy which is also a huge plus! I think next time I will use drumsticks though.

I used drumstick as well as chicken breast and everybody in my family like the breasts better. Great recipe I will use it again.

Loved it!   Added Adobe salt and two heavy pinches of whole wheat flour since we were out of bread crumbs.   Definitely will make this again and going to try it on flatten chicken breast next time.

I made this last night and it was a keeper! The parmesan crust has a great flavor. The cooking time worked great but I did flip the chicken once so the other side would get brown too. Like some others, I don't dredge the chicken in shallow bowls, I just shake it all together in a ziploc bag. One less dish to wash!

I really enjoyed but had a harder time pleasing my 9 yr. old. I did soak in buttermilk overnight and also added bread crumbs. Good recipe.

This was a hit with both my husband and my 2 year old, who swore she didn't like chicken but ended up asking for seconds.  I halved the recipe, used 1/2 cup parmesan & 1/2 cup unflavored bread crumbs, mixed in garlic salt, garlic powder, italian seasoning, and a bit of pepper.  Will definitely make again.

My son says this was the best chicken I ever made!   My oldest son said it needed more parm cheese!   I will make it with 1/4 c. bread crumbs and 1 3/4 c. parm next time.   I also added garlic and onion powder to the parm cheese mixture!   It was the juiciest chicken I have ever made!  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! I'm brand new to cooking, and this is the most successful dinner I've had so far. I followed some reviews here and, after thawing, shook the chicken in a plastic bag with flour, then dipped it in 2 eggs (1 wasn't enough), then rolled it in the parmesan, which I added some garlic salt, oregano, 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and garlic powder to. It came out a little too salty; next time I'll only use 1 tsp garlic salt and no reguar salt. I only had 10 drumsticks but plenty of the parmesan mix left over, so I'd recommend cutting down on parmesan if you're adding bread crumbs. The parmesan started burning after 35 minutes, but that could be because I sprinkled some of the extra parmesan mix on before putting it in the oven. Served with fresh sweet corn - this one's a keeper!

I made this using half cheese and half bread crumbs. I also added garlic and some salt, but omitted the pepper. It turned out delicious.

My wife and I LOVED this dish, and it's very hard to please her.  I did a few extra steps to give it a little more umph and it was fantastic.  I dredged the legs in flour seasoned with just salt, then I dredged them in the egg but I had the egg seasoned with some cajun seasoning and then covered with the parmesan cheese seasoned with garlic and onion powder and italian bread crumbs.  It was delicious!

I have been making a recipe similar to this for 20 years or so. But of course I have a few changes and one of the best ingredients was left out.. the fresh parsley really makes it special..add it to the parmesan and put in some good bread crumbs. I also usually coat the chicken in melted butter to make the cheese, bread and parsley and garlic powder stick. Works great! This is my comfort dish for sure.

These were delicious. Would have been 5 stars but I made alot of alterations based on the most helpful review, I basically used her recipe instead of the original. They came out juicy inside and nice and crunchy outside. Will definitely make again.

My parents love this dish. My chicken did become soggy so I took off the aluminum foil and let it bake also I frequently changed the chickens side( So it would evenly cook). My chicken become crisp and yummy. Also when whipping the egg I added Italian Dressing to it. That added more spice to it. The only bad thing was the chicken took a long time to cook. But that was mostly my fault because I turned the chicken frequently.

Such a simple recipe and so good.  I baked my chicken on wire racks to keep the skin crispy all around.  Also, I added a tsp of garlic powder and of another garlic/oregano blend.  The bite from the black pepper was still the best part though!

I thought this chicken recipe was good but it seemed like it needed more. I dipped the chicken in the beaten egg, then in parmesan cheese, then in egg again & then in Italian bread crumbs. Sprinkled it with garlic salt & pepper. Baked it according to your directions and it came out golden brown & delicious.

Fabulous. Five stars because it was so easy and so tasty. The chicken was very tender and the outside was nice and crispy. I followed the recipe exactly, It didn't need anything extra. Quick dinner with mac and cheese and a salad!

This was very good. I did half parmesan and half seasoned bread crumbs. I also used dijon mustard to coat the legs (brushed on with a pastry brush)as I find egg too thick. This is great! Very easy to put together at the last minute.

Chicken was good - recipe is easy.  But when I cooked the chicken drumsticks I noticed a reddish color (almost like blood) coming out of the bone.  Did I do something wrong?  When I saw that I lost my appetite for the chicken.  My kids and husband liked it, so I'll make it again.  How do you cook the drumsticks so blood does not come out of the bone???

This was so quick to prepare and so so good! I used chicken thighs, and sprinkled slivered almonds on top. The chicken browned up nicely and was very moist inside. My husband, who is hard to impress, said 'this is a keeper' - which is his highest rating. Will definitely make this again and again. Thanks so much for a great and simple recipe!

I had to whip something up with the drumsticks I had defrosted and came across this recipe.  It was so easy to make and delicious!!  After reading the other reviews, I made the following changes for 7 drumsticks:  3/4 cup parmasian cheese; 1/4 cup crushed seasoned crutons (since I didn't have breadcrumbs); 1/4 tsp each of pepper, salt (but I would even use less salt next time), rosemary, italian seasoning and garlic powder.  It was delicious and turned out so crispy.  MUCH better than shake and bake!

I think this was a good quick recipe. I would however add a few more spices such as basil and a little red pepper, otherwise it tasted a little bland.

wow!! This is soooooooo easy and really tender and good. I also used fine 3 cheese crumbs and a small amount of garlic powder, only fixed 6 so I used 1 cup of parmesan  and cut back on salt.
Thanks for the recipe!!

This was pretty good.  I used 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup of herbed bread stuffing, and maybe 1 tbsp of garlic powder for 20 chicken drumsticks.  I baked this for almost an hour since it was still a bit pink inside.

I totally loved this.  I have an amazing chicken parmesan recipe, but was looking for something easier, i add a few of my own seasonings, and pealed off the skin of the chicken, and I was making it for dinner, but they were so good my 3 year old and i ate all 7 legs.  So good job this reciepe was great, and would be good on pork too.  MMMMM. Thanks

Easy recipe the whole family can eat but I found it to be a little on the bland side I will make it again but adding much more seasoning.  Also I don't like chicken legs so mine will be on a boneless chicken breast but my 2 sons and husband that like dark meat loved the recipe.

Excellent - and - Simple!  The next time I try it I will drizzle melted butter/margarine over it.  It did not brown after 1 hour.  That may be because I am at a high altitude.

5 STARS!! this was excellent! I added fresh chopped garlic to the cheese and after reading the other reviews,cut back on the amount of cheese and added crushed potato chips!(no bread crumbs handy!) The chicken turned out crispy, yet tender and so full of flavor! It smells amazing while cooking.So easy to make,I'm definately keeping this in my recipe book!

All the makings of a great recipe: common ingredients, easy prep, low-carbs, great taste... My boyfriend made it, so it was definitely easy! Kids loved it. Tasted great. Minor modification needed next time: we didn't have quite as much parmesan as we needed (about 1.5 cups) yet there was quite a bit of mix leftover. Next time I'll reduce the parmesan to about 1-1/4 cup or so.

I can't believe no one else made a comment on how much parmesan was left over.  I had only eight chicken drum sticks and used only 1 cup of parmesan and still had lots left (which I had to throw out).  Overall a good chicken dinner but I'm not sure if I will make it again with so many recipes to pick from.  Michele, Ontario, Canada

9-5-2017  ~This was just what I was after, a tasty low-carb option for chicken.  It couldn’t have been easier, speedier or more delicious.  Bread crumbs weren’t even missed and it spared me a ton of unnecessary carbs!  Because Parmesan is salty enough (I used Parmigiano-Reggiano) there was no need to add the salt called for, but I did add some garlic powder. A little chopped parsley would have been nice too but I was too lazy – next time! I’m not a fan of chicken legs so I substituted boneless chicken breasts, baking them a mere 20 minutes.  Juicy, tender and flavorful, this was an unexpected hit.

My family really enjoyed this chicken. I first soaked the drumsticks in salt water for an hour and then dried them. Then they were dunked in milk, then egg and lastly rolled in my Parmesan mixture of cheese, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. I let them sit in the fridge for a half hour and then stuck them in the oven to bake. MmmMmm:)... so very yummy and the house smelled like italian cooking. Very comforting!

Everyone in the house LOVED this recipe! I added garlic powder, oregano, and bread crumbs to the parmesan cheese and coated the chicken in that mixture (I used the advise of another review).  Absolutely delicious.  I created a profile on this website just to give this recipe a review! Big hit in the Woodman household!

This recipe is great with a few of the mentioned tweaks from others!  Panko breadcrumbs work well as an addition to the cheese along with your preferred seasoning.  I also recommend soaking the drumsticks in salt water to draw some of the blood out as was mentioned.  Will definitely be a repeat recipe!

Made this for a 5-course meal for my mother and two sisters, which was my gift to my mother this last Christmas. I made this with 100%-off frozen drumsticks found behind a local grocery store ("my supplier" as we called it), and all three of them were pretty impressed. They asked about the recipe, and my mother even says she can't remember the last time she had such a tasty drumstick! === I followed the original recipe mostly except: *Like others, I par-boiled the drumsticks and let dry before coating to ensure the chicken would get crispier and save on oven-time (cheesecake was baking at the moment). *I used only 1/2 cup parmesan since I was worried about the coating being too salty (and there was still some breading mix left). *Like others, I added roughly 2 tsp some oregano. It didn't take away from the parmesan, but it sure added some flavour. // I would definitely make this again -- this is by far the EASIEST, TASTIEST WAY TO DO UP YOUR CHICKEN. It almost makes one feel guilty for taking compliments on how good it is, lol.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was heaven. I made half the recipe. To the cheese mixture I did half Italian bread crumbs and half Parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp each onion and garlic powder, paprika and the salt and pepper. I baked it on 350 for about 1 hour because I baked another dish along with it. Thanks for keeper recipe Anika.

The chicken was crispy. I would like more flavor. I did use 1/2C Italian bread crumbs and 1 1/2C parmesan. Next time I would use more garlic. Also I used aluminum foil to line my pan, but it still stuck. Next time I will use non-stick foil.

Delicious! I added garlic powder and italian seasoning to the parmesan cheese, along with some wheat germ (I didn't have bread crumbs as others suggested). Also, I accidentally dipped one of the drumsticks in the parmesan mixture first and realized that this helped the egg mixture stick better and I ended with only a little bit of parmesan cheese left over. The only thing I would do differently next time is brine or boil the drumsticks beforehand to help with the blood seeping out during baking.

I thought this recipe was great. The only downside if i could find any is the parmesan graduates from sharp to mellow flavoring. It still tastes great but as a lover of sharp cheese I was slightly disappointed. I finely diced 1.5 cups off a block of parm and added .5 cup pre-shredded. The best part of the dish is the chicken comes out FRIED. My theory is the oils expelling from the cheese under that heat seep in and fry the chicken. 

BOTTOM LINE GREAT DISH! and you can do anything you want too that parm mix to uniquely flavor it :)

OMG I am so in love with this recipe!! And best part is my picky 7 and 4 year olds both adore it! (I made 10 drumsticks and they are GONE.)  I added onion powder and garlic powder for a little more taste . Over all though it is amazingly easy. My first time baking chicken too. :3

WOW!!!  For something so simple, this is pretty awesome!  I hardly changed a thing – the only thing I did change in re: to the ingredients was add a little Italian Seasoning.  I don’t think breadcrumbs are necessary.  I altered it to 3 servings and used chicken breasts instead and coated it with the grated parm cheese – works equally as well!  I cooked it with broccoli mixed with turkey bacon and a mango/chipotle salad dressing, and corn with onion and mushroom with some butter.  HUGE hit.   The hubby was amazed and there’s no doubt we will make this again.

Love this recipe. I made it for the first time for dinner for my boyfriend and I. However, i did what alot of people did was boil the chicken in water. But before i put the chicken in water, I let the water boil with some potatoes, salt, cilantro, green peppers, garlic, rosemary, oregano, bay leaves, onions, carrots and celery. after it boiled for 15-20 minutes i dipped it in the egg and rolled it in the mix. my chicken was done in 35 minutes, It was delicious, thankyou!!

Like others suggested, I added garlic and oregano to the parmesan. Also 45 minutes was too long for my oven; I ended up taking them out at about 37 minutes.

This was pretty tasty, I took others advice and parboiled the chicken first, then baked at recommended temp for about 20 minutes.  Also added oregano and about 1/4 cup of italian style bread crumbs.

Served with butter herb mashed potatoes and garlic toast.  

Will definitely make again!

did not have luck with this,   took two hours for the meat to cook, and I only made half the recipe amount. I will try again to see if it was a one time fluke.

Excellent!  I also took the suggestions of other reviewers. I mixed a little garlic powder to the Parmesan cheese. I also added italian bread crumbs to give it a little more body (ratio: 2 parts cheese to 1 part bread crumbs). I par boiled the chicken in salt water which made it super moist. I baked at 400 for 35-40 minutes.  My family loved it!

I thought this was very good. I did soak chicken in salt water first to get rid of the blood. I will reduce the parm cheese mix needed next time as I had way too much left over & threw out.  Good meal

My family (and myself) were not big fans of this one. Not sure what went wrong. I followed the comments of others...soaked my chicken in salt water for an entire day (did make it very tender) as far as the recipe itself went....the only thing I did was shake my chicken legs in flour before the egg and then parm...I dont know, probably just different tastes

This is a decent week-night recipe. The taste isn't much different from other oven fried chicken recipes. I lowered the baking temperature because the coating was burning.

Big hit with the whole family, except my son who doesn't like fried chicken -- or any chicken with skin for that matter.  I followed some tips in previous reviews plus after I removed the chicken from the baking pan I tossed baby spinach and onions in the drippings. Delish.

I added garlic salt and pre-flash fried/browned the chicken in veg oil. Then baked at 350 for 35-40 minutes. The chicken was cooked all the way through (my 1st requisite) and delicious. I will make it again.

These were exceptional. My husband raved at how the flavor was throughout. I pre-cooked them in a pan with some olive oil, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders. I recommend only doing this for 1 to 2 minutes at most. Mine went a little too long and were on the verge of being dry.   Then, I let them cool and pat them dry. Next, I dredged them in flour (lightly), dipped them in the egg, then coated with the parmesan and seasonings. I baked them at 400 until they were gold brown.

This was good, and quick & easy! I added some italian seasonings and whatnot, but it still tasted just a bit bland. I think next time I will season the coating a bit more heavily. I really LOVE the crispy texture!! For those who find it to be "mushy", try taking the skin off, and then following the recipe. That's what I did to cut down on the fat, and it really was very crispy!

The chicken turned out so incredibly tender!  More than I have ever been able to accomplish.  The parmesan in my opinion, was a little much.  If it were toned down a bit it would be perfect!

I thought this was delicious!  I didn't have a problem with sogginess as others stated, they came out crispy and delicious.  You should make sure to watch your cooking time though.  My chicken was done a lot sooner than recipe stated.  I would also add bread crumbs and garlic powder like other reviewers suggested.  It definitely adds more depth of flavor.  Thank you for this recipe!

Yummy yummy yummy! I never would of thought of putting chicken and cheese together. It was tender on the inside and semi-crunchy on the outside. My friends enjoyed these, asking me to make more in the future. Eating it by itself is delicious but eating it with a side of salad absolutely makes your meal right there!  Note: If you like your chicken saltier, add garlic salt or regular salt.

I love this dish.  So simple and yet so good.  I did not have fresh parmesan but instead used about 20 little bags of pizza parmesan cheese for 12 drumsticks.  Went light on salt and did add tempura crumbs with some garlic powder, chili powder and italian seasonings.  I used two eggs in ziploc to coat the drumsticks and then coat them with crumbs & cheese.  It helps to use a rack while baking to ensure even crispiness.  A winner!

Very tasty.  And super easy.  A great combination.  The top and side of the chicken was crispy and delicious.  I agree with another review however, the the bottom was soggy.

This was really quite terrible tasting, the parmesan flavor was overwhelming and the bottom of the chicken was burnt.  I followed this recipe exactly and I noticed that most of the 5 star reviews are a tweaked version of the recipe.

So easy.  I think cheap parmesan and lots of salt and pepper are the key.  We all love this, even picky 3 year olds.

This chicken recipe was so easy to make.  I did add onion and garlic powder to the cheese.  My family loved it and kept telling me how good it smelled.  The only thing I would do different is to lightly coat my baking dishes with cooking oil so spray to ensure the chicken does not stick.  Just another fabulous recipe, that I recommend and will make again!

Okay so I admit after reading other reviewers comments I did make a few changes. That is why I gave it a four star. I added garlic powder and adobo to the cheese along with a small amount of bread crumbs. I also floured the chicken before dipping it in the egg. I only cooked it for 25-30 minutes.
Will make again! Thanks!

This recipe is very flavorful and juicy. I used the advise of another member and boiled the chicken in salted water for about 15 minutes, which cut the cooking time to about 20-25 minutes. I also added about 2 tablespoons of heavy cream to the egg mixture for a denser coating since I used egg beaters instead of an actual egg. Great quick and fast recipe.

My toddler loves drumsticks so I thought I'd try this.  The flavor and aroma of these were great, but the coating seemed to just fall off the chicken.  Perhaps it was because I parboiled the chicken as suggested in other reviews. I would try this again, this time without parboiling.  BTW, my son ate his entire serving (which is very rare.)

I added chicken drumsticks in a Pyrex dish filled with lukewarm water, a handful of sugar, and a handful of salt. Brine for 30 min to keep the chicken juicy and tender while baking in the oven.

Followed the rest of the recipe exactly, except for adding garlic and onion powder and a tiny bit of cornmeal (did not have breadcrumbs) to the dry ingredients, as others have suggested. VERY easy and delicious. The crust came out perfectly crisp and gooey at the same time. You might want to omit the salt, since the parmesan is a bit salty on its own, like most cheeses. The meat was also very moist. My boyfriend loved it too! :)

My son loved this chicken, so I'll make it again.  However, calling for 2 cups of parmesan was a lot...most of it ended up in the garbage. I'd start out with a smaller amount - probably half, and it would be enough. If not, it's easy enough to mix up a little more.

This is a new family favorite. I am not a huge fan of chicken on a bone or dark meat but I am outnumbered at my house. The kids and husband cheer when they find out I am making this! I do like to make it on a grill pan, otherwise the bottoms get soggy.

My family thought this was the bomb -- in a good way. I added a handful of Italian breadcrumbs, and a dash of salt and pepper as suggested by others. Freshly grated Parm adds to the saltiness. So easy and had good flavor. Had it with seasoned rice and a veggie. When you're in a hurry and have to act like you thought about dinner, make this.

I didnt have the pepper, so I left it out. And I added like 3 teaspoons of water in the eggs. It came out GREAT. But I boiled it in water first so the inside was partly cooked. My first time cooking something other then cake and it tasted great! Will make again~

No need to use bread crumbs ANY more! This was fantastic. Modification = added garlic and onion powder to the cheese and a dash of Italian spices. Used 11 chicken breasts - two cups is a LOT of cheese for this.  Sprinkled the remaining on top of each breast and then added a dollop of butter. Baked for 40 mins. YUM.....perfect for a low carb dinner.

Absolutely yummy! I followed a previous reviewer's advice about adding breadcrumbs, dried oregano and parsley into the mix. I also used two eggs instead of one to better coat the drumsticks. I did not have grated Parmesan, and used shredded Italian-mix cheese (Romano, Parmesan, Asiago and Mozzarella) instead but it turned out fantastic. This is a keeper!

Fantastic.  The only thing I changed was seasoning the Parmesan cheese a bit more.  I used "Tastefully Simple" seasoning salt.  Fantastic.  My husband and son raved about the meal.  If these two picky eaters love it, it has to be great!

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes...a dash of paprika, Lawry's and bread crumbs. I used drumsticks and breast pieces...and the drumsticks turned out much better for some reason. My husband and I both loved it!

This chicken was awesome. My family loved it. I didn't use 2c of cheese as it calls for though. I put about a tbsp of milk with the egg. In the parmesan I mixed it with garlic salt with parsley. I will definitely keep this one. Just Awesome!!!

This was ok.  It was kind of bland.  Next time I think I'll add some other seasonings to it.  This recipe is a good start to something really good.

This was so easy and was very good!  I added garlic powder, onion powder and dehydrated onion to the cheese and added about a tablespoon of milk to the egg.  It was enough cheese for 16 drumsticks and still had some left so had to throw it out.  I'd use 1 1/2 cups instead next time to eliminate waste.  It turned out crispy and juicy...my boyfriend ate 10 drumsticks!

This is really good. After reading the reviews, I added more pepper, some onion powder, and a lot of garlic powder. I also cut down on the parmesan cheese and replaced 1/3 with breadcrumbs. I sprinkled a little more of the mixture over the drumsticks about halfway through, and sprinkled some mozarella on for the last two minutes. I only had five drumsticks and they cooked perfectly at just over forty minutes. I'm definitely making this again.

great and EASY.  My 18m old and husband loved it.  I cooked it on a broiler pan so it wasn't too greasy.  I just added some garlic powder and definitely did not use all the cheese it called for (and I used a LOT)

Easily 4.5 Stars! Such a tasty recipe, even w/my own alterations (I read all prior reviews). Took me a little longer than 45 mins @ 400, but the drumsticks were tender and GOOD :) A new favorite in our home!

Nice and easy and *new* chicken recipe. I added about 1tbs milk to the eggs and 1tsp garlic powder to the cheese. I know many people said they had alot of cheese mixture left but for some reason I needed to make 1/2 batch more...maybe because I used fresh grated parmesian grated long(I did have a little left over which I sprinkled on top before baking)...Anyhow this was nice and new just a little too peppery for me and my girls(they peeled the skin off and ate just the chicken). Next time I will cut down the pepper to 1/2tsp, add more garlic powder(1 tsp was hardly noticed) and try mixing some breadcrumbs in with the cheese like some others have done. Chicken was crispy and tender. Perfectly cooked after 45min!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I used eggbeaters and ½ cup grated parm / ½ cup shredded parm with a lot of garlic powder (no salt or pepper); perfect for 6 drumsticks.  This is a great low carb meal!

This is amazing!  My whole family ate this, which NEVER happens.  My husband proclaimed "This is awesome freakin' chicken!"  My five-year-old son, who hasn't touched any meat not in nugget form for the last year, ate a whole piece!  Even my ten-month-old baby shared in the chickeny goodness.  The only things I did differently were using hindquarters instead of drumsticks, and using a cheddar/mozzerella/powdered parmesan mixture for the cheese coating.  When you read this recipe it really sounds unlikely that this will come out good, but it's definitely worth the time to try it at least once!  We had it for dinner last night and I've already been asked to make it again!

Ok, when I rated this last time I didn't elaborate. Here is what I did different because my family eats mainly white meat. I used 4 b/s chix breasts. Used a cup of seasoned bread crumbs and increased my egg by one. I added some oregano, thyme, garlic powder and onion powder as some people have suggestion for flavor. I set the oven at 350 for about 30-35 min. (depending upon the thickness of the breast). I made homemade red sauce and poured it on top for those who wanted it. This is the only way my family will eat parmesan chicken now, lol.

This recipe is very versatile and forgiving. I marinated the drumsticks in a balsamic and basil vinagrette for a few hours first, then added some garlic powder, onion powder and a little Old Bay seasoning to the coating. For the coating I used half bread crumbs and half cheese. All I had on hand was shredded pizza blend but it all came out wonderfully. I think next time I might try some variation with a cheddar cheese mixture. You can pretty much run with it. Everyone loved it. Thank you!

Very good!  I didn't have any drumsticks, so I used thighs (bone-in) and about seven of them used up the one egg and only about a cup of parmesan.  Next time I will mix up a cup of parmesan and add more as needed - hate to throw any away.  I added paprika, garlic powder, and italian seasoning, as suggested in other reviews - it was excellent!  DH even commented - and both kids liked it - that's a winner :)

LOVE this recipe.  So very easy and so tasty.  Such a nice change to boring chicken.  I used 2 parts romano/parmesan to one part bread crumbs.  Then sprinkled some italian seasoning on top.  This smells incredible.  There is never a single leftover drumstick in this house!

I'm giving this 4 stars as I changed the recipe a bit.  With the changes though, I'd give it 5 stars for a great low carb "breading."  I've used boneless chicken breasts & cooked them no longer than 30 minutes.  The 1st time I made the recipe, I thought it was a little bland.  The 2nd time, I added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt & pepper & then, the last 10 minutes, topped it with low fat mozzarella to make chicken parmesan.  I topped it with red suace at the table & served it with whole wheat pasta.  If you like more of a strong flavor, you also could substitute parmesan-romano for the parmesan cheese.  I've also used the breadless "breading" when making fish sticks in the oven & it was good too.

After reading the reviews this recipe recieved, I thought I'd give it a shot and I am glad I did.  I really really liked it!  I don't like bones in my meat so I used skinless boneless ckicken breast instead.  I am going to make it again (2nd time this week).  I have a 3 month old baby so I need dinners that are quick, and this definately fits that criteria!

I did some changes to the recipe. I used 1 cup regular Parmesan and used 1 cup of Parmesan, Romano and Asiago Medium Cheese, Progresso Garlic and Herb bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon of Tasty Tangy Garlic, Ranch and Chives seasoning. Didn't have to use salt and pepper. Line my grill with foil and poke holes so any liquid can drain into bottom of pan. Loved it.

Its good. Maybe I like a little more zest flavor though. My daughter liked it. Next time I plan to add old bay seasoning to spice it up. I did the recommendation to boil the drumsticks in salted water for 25 min. Then dip in egg, flour and the parm cheese before baking at 350 for 40 min. It turned out okay, not really amazing. Next time I probably wont use the flour and dip in parm cheese, bread crumbs and old bay instead.

If you use foil spray it so you don’t loose the yummy cheese on the bottom. I thought it was good. The color is a little unappetizing but that is the nature of the ingredients.

I added a lot more ingredients to season my chicken like thyme, paprika, onion powder, Old Bay, Adobbo and this made for a delicious recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly. While I was making it, I was sure it wasn't going to work. It was delicious! It tastes like it has a fried chicken-like crust on it. My whole family liked it-- a keeper for sure!

So good and so easy. I read a lot of the reviews and did make these changes: 1. boiled chicken for 10 minutes first, dried off and proceeded. 2. I did add plain bread crumbs in a 1:2 ratio with cheese. 3. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion powder.  (will experiment a little more with spices next time, maybe a pinch of paprika).  Funny thing, I overcooked them cuz I went for a quick trip to the store and when I came back the internal temp of the drumsticks was 200 degrees. I figured I ruined them, but they were still moist and delicious.  My wife loved them to (although when she comes home from work to dinner I've made, she's pretty easy to please and appreciative).

It wasn't super flavorful, even with an excess of cheese.   I added some garlic powder and still, not the best chicken I ever had.  That being said, it was moist and the coating was crispy enough.  Not bad - more spices would be good.

This was delicious and easy.  Drumsticks came out nice and crispy.  Thanks Anika P S It may be good to buy 2 cups of fresh grated parmesan. It takes a long time to grate if it's a good grade hard parmesan.

Made this for a friend who was celiac (because it was just a parmesan cheese coating) and it got rave reviews.  I did add some spices as suggested  - oregano, onion powder, garlic powder and a shake of cayenne.  Will definitely make it again

I’m a terrible cook and this actually came out really great according to my husband who is an amazing cook. I added adobo and garlic powder as someone else suggested and used Italian Blend shredded cheese. We ate it with white rice, asparagus, and beets. Hubby said it’s the best “overall” meal I’ve cooked! Yayyyy! Definitely on my list of “few things I can make :)”

This was delicious but I felt that with just parmesan it would be bland. so I did not make it the first time as the recipe calls for it to be made. I added 1 packet of dry ranch dressing to the parmesan mixture and it brought more flavor. my husband says this a keeper with how I tweaked it.

I don't feel right posting this as a 2 star because that's not fair after tweaking the recipe but even after reading the reviews and making some changes it was still not good.  I decided to flour, egg wash and then coat the drumsticks and cook them in our air fryer.  Because so many commented on how bland they are I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also seasoned the Parmesan with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.  Unfortunately it was still tasteless.  I don't know what more I could have done to give these flavor.  IF I were to try this again (and that's a huge "if") I guess I could try seasoning the drumsticks themselves....  I was really excited about these last night.  I was even more disappointed.

I made this as written, using freshly grated parmesan cheese, and I was a bit generous with the salt and pepper (as usual). It came out great - I was very pleased. The skin was crispy and delicious. DH says it should go into the occasional rotation pile. Next time I'll grease the pan, as it did stick a little.

Loved it! Instead of tomatoe sauce I used El Pato, same thing but a little spicy. I also shredded the meat and drizzled it on top of the rice. My kids LOVED it, especially the sauce!!

I used mayonnaise instead of egg and mixed some crumbs in with the Parmesan and some onion powder and dry basil.  And I didn't do anything to get the blood out!  It wasn't an issue as some reviewers commented and yes it was yummy.  Cooked for less time so make sure you check on it. Chicken was very moist!

A great recipe! Simple and inexpensive. I did follow the additions of a couple of reviewers. I used chicken thighs and I added some garlic powder to the Parmesan cheese. Still cooked at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. The chicken came out with a perfect internal temperature and, most importantly, it was absolutely delicious.

Really, really good! Light, not greasy, not dry. Absolutely perfect.

Halved the recipe. 1/4 cup powder parmesan cheese, 3/4 cups panko, salt and pepper, and a few shakes of curry powder. 200 C for 50 minutes in 8 inch square pyrex, 10 small drumsticks fit in. Crushed the panko a bit with the cheese to get it a bit more powdered and consistent. One egg.

"We gotta have this again!" That's high praise from my kids. Like many other reviewers, I tweaked this a bit. I added some breadcrumbs and some garlic powder. Chicken was tender and juicy. There was way too much cheese, however. I had a lot left over, which I think is a waste. So I would decrease a bit, maybe using 1 1/3 cup-to-1 1/2 cup. Also, I needed a second egg.

It was delicious!!! My husband and I both loved it!!! I however did change a few things, I added chili flakes to my cheese I also added powered garlic and I added some seasoned bread crumbs to add more texture. I par boiled the chicken which was a great idea because it didn't take long for the chicken to be all done. Got rid of all the blood that would've came out while baking.. It was full of flavor and juicy! I'm making this again!

We really enjoyed this dish, but I had the chicken too crowded into the pan so they didn't crisp all over like they probably should have.  Another time I would spread them out and follow advice of other people who either marinade the chicken or add garlic and other flavours.  The whole house smelled amazing while it cooked, but the flavour didn't soak into the chicken at all, just stayed on the outside. Very simple and easy to prepare and would definitely make it again!

I was pleased to have parboiled the drumsticks beforehand which caused a lot of fat to run out. The coating with added garlic powder and oregano is very tasty and it makes the chicken crispy however as stated in several other reviews, the flavor never gets to the drumstick because the meat is too thick therefore making it bland. I'm not crazy about dark meat so if i try this again I will use breasts. I also sprinkled paprika on top for a golden brown color and cooked on a rack so it doesn't get soggy. I rated it low because the process of boiling, flouring, egg washing, then coating was too much for the results.

Easiest & yummiest recipe ever! I added herbs and paprika to the mix...had some mix left over so sliced some potatoes (5cm thick), dipped in egg, then cheese mix & put it into the oven at the same time. It was absolutely delicious. Chicken was moist throughout & potatoes were equally fantastic. My husband was very impressed; I can see it becoming a favourite in our house!

I altered it some and it was delicious! I seasoned the chicken with no salt, garlic powder, onion powder and poultry seasoning. I also added a cup of bread crumbs to the parmesan. Hubby really liked it.

There has to be something odd here.  I made this with real parmesan and am starting to think that the powdery jars of parmesan was what the recipe is really calling for. I soaked the chicken in salty, floured with seasoned flour with garlic, pepper, and salt, dredged in egg and then in garlic seasoned real parmesan, and it was extremely bland tasting even though it looked absolutely great out of the oven.  The tastes just were not there.  It helped with a LOT of salt.  I think the type of parmesan you are using is critical component that has been left out really.

I am no chef... but can easily follow a recipe. This chicken turned out to be all together WAY TOO SALTY! My husband didn't even take the left-overs for lunch (he'll take just about anything for lunch). Sounds great - but just TOO salty. All my kids picked the parmesan 'crust' off and ate only the chicken... won't make again :(

I used this recipe using chicken breasts and it came out WONDERFUL.  My husband really enjoyed his dinner.  I followed it as instructed; however, I did dredge the breasts in wheat flour before soaking in egg & Parmesan cheese.  Cooked 45 minutes, perfect!

This was a pretty good dish; I'm pretty sure I'd never cooked chicken drumsticks before. The taste per se may not be quite 4-stars in my opinion, but I bumped my overall rating up because the recipe is so easy and makes a lot of servings. I made this almost exactly as written; I used freshly-ground black pepper, and sea salt. Instead of dipping the drumsticks in the egg mixture, I brushed it on liberally. I tried to roll the pieces in the cheese mixture well, but I guess I'm still not very good at coating things, as only about half of the cheese got used this way. The baking dish wasn't specified, but I barely managed to cram everything into a 9x13 Pyrex dish, and sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top of it all. 45 minutes wasn't quite enough, in my case, to cook the chicken thoroughly "or until brown", so a couple of more minutes were needed. (I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but there are 300! already, so I'll skip that.)

The only change I make in this recipe is to use a parmesan/romano/asiago shred blend that my grocery store sells. It smells so good while it's cooking and I love the super crispy skin b/c of the cheese. This is a big hit with everyone in our family and it's so easy to throw together.

Like others, I did 1/2 parm 1/2 bread crumbs. I also added a little italion seasoning for flavor. Does smell great while cooking!

Loved this, so easy to make, and the flavour just seems to sink into the chicken. I usually make is with Chicken Breasts instead or drumsticks.

While this recipe was amazing, I changed quite a few things to give it more flavor. I mixed the parmesan with equal portions bread crumbs. I also added one clove of garlic, minced. Another thing I would also highly recommend would be separating the chicken from the bone, heating oil in a pan over medium heat and cook it on the stove top rather then in the oven. It was incredibly succulent!

I prepared the recipe exactly as written, and everyone in the family liked it, so of course it is a keeper! I will reduce the salt next time because it was very salty.

This recipe was fairly good.  Everyone in the family liked it but none felt that they would put in a special request to make it again.  In reading some of the other reviews I agree that a little customizing would go a long way from making this a good dish to a great dish so if I haven't already scared you off read some of the suggestions and give it a try.  One important note is that I did not need even close to two cups of parmesan cheese.  1 heaping cup was more than plenty for twelve chicken legs. Oh...and it really does make the house smell WONDERFUL!

Easy and delicious. I also added a bit of bread crumbs to the cheese mix. I put foil on the pan but forgot to spray it with Pam and the chicken stuck. But a great recipe. Thanks

I followed some of the other suggestions and added bread crumbs, onion, and garlic powder.  I also boiled the Chicken before.  I have very picky eaters, and every one ate the chicken, even the one who lives on PB&J.  This will become a frequent meal in our house.

i followed natalie p's comments, and this worked out great. when i told my husband i was going to make chicken, he got so excited (i have a family chicken dish i make often). after i told him i was trying a new recipe, all i got was an "oh, nevermind." i said to him, "i promise this will be good! it got really great reviews!"  i boiled the drumsticks first, dipped in egg and flour, then dipped into the cheese mixture (i used parmesan, garlic powder, and panko bread crumbs). my entire family loved it, even my 2-year old. thanks for a great recipe!

Surprisingly good.  The crust was very tasty.  I tried it with leg quarters and that doesn't work well at all.  Will make this again with just legs.  The kids loved it.

Very good recipe. I followed the other reviewers' recommendation of boiling the drumsticks first. For the coating, I used half fresh grated bread crumbs - had an old baguette, half cheese, mix with egg and salt, then covered the mixture evenly over the drumsticks. Then I added some creole seasoning. It ended up to be quite similar to fried chicken, with a nice crunchy exterior.

I've been doing more cooking lately, and since I'm no wizard in the kitchen, I've been trying simple recipes. I enjoyed this quite a bit. Simple. Tasty. Quick. Fiancee wasn't fond; but I may have over-done the parmesan cheese. Oops!

My husband said these were perfect. The kids elected not to have a second helping, which surprised me considering how crunchy there were. I coooked them on a rack and turned them over halfway through. Next time I'll use seasoned breadcrumbs.

I am only giving 4 stars because I did change the recipe around a bit.  Instead of using the egg mixture, I used italian dressing, and it was really flavorful.  The drumsticks were very juicy and moist, and we are looking forward to making this recipe again!

This was definitely good. I only had a little ground parm, so I used shredded and it was still great. Per other suggestions, I used garlic salt, pepper, and whole wheat panko bread crumbs. This was quite easy, and good for leftovers too.

"This is good."  That was hubby's remark.  I LOVED IT cuz it was easy and a quick fix.  He said he'd like to see me try it with spagetti sauce next time more like a traditional parmesan chicken.  I didn't have a full two cups of parmesan and had to use about 1/4 cup potato flakes but other than followed the directions exactly.  Mine didn't brown evenly and I was scared the one side was getting mushy and since the top didn't seem to be browning I turned them once three quarters through the cooking time (45 min).  I think I'm a pretty tough food critic and for taste I would probably do a 3 but gave it four for ease and the fact you always have the ingredients in the kitchen.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

This recipe was delicious.  The only thing I did was add a little bit of breadcrumbs to the cheese.

SO GOOD! I used chicken tenders and added bread crumbs to the parmesan, as well as some spices and garlic powder. I coated the tenders first with the parmesan mixture, then dipped them in the egg batter, and then dipped again in the coating. They baked up wonderfully!

I only gave this one 3 stars but i totally screwed it up... i only had one cup of the parmesan so i added a cup of flour.... way too much but i gotta tell you guys my VERY finicky 3 yr old ate the heck out of it... it would have been better without all that flour.  Next time i will know!!!

Used boneless skinless because that is what I had and cut down the time to 25-30 mins.  This turned out crispy, low carb, and not dry.  Thanks so much :-)

I would only make exactly what will be eaten next time, the leftovers were not very good.  The chicken was easy and amazing.  I may also try chicken breast on a broiler pan next time too.

This was really awesome!  I did mix the parm cheese with seasoned breadcrumbs and dipped the chicken in egg mixed with half&half (basically because that's what I had on hand).  I had a bunch of teenagers converge on my house for dinner tonite & didn't know what I was going to make!  This was a hit with everyone from my 8yo to my 20yo and all in between!  Served it with some garlic toast & buttered veges and a great meal was had by all.  Thanks!!

Great recipe, but here are a few suggestions to add...In place of the egg use a creamy italian dressing. Add bacon bits(fresh or salad bits) to the cheese along with a bread crumb combination. Add Italian seasoning to the cheese and bread crumb mixture. Add 5-10 minutes baking time due to the thickness of mixture. Enjoy a cheesy with a bit of sweetness dish.

My best friend made this for us (per my recommendation to look on AR of course) and it was wonderful.  She made them into chicken strips and they were so crispy and delicious.  I will definitely be making this at my house.  Thank you Anika!

I was amazed at how simple and good this recipe is.  It's great every time.

I have yet to try any of the tips other people have listed, like soaking the chicken or using flour.  I have, however, used chicken breasts a few times, cooking them for about half as long, which gets dinner on the table within about 30 minutes.

Very tasty! I added flour to the parmesan cheese and seasoned the whole mix with garlic powder and black pepper.  Dredged the chicken pieces in the flour/cheese mix first, then egg, then flour/cheese mix again for that added crisp on the outside. Will try this again with chicken breasts for a healthier alternative!

Added garlic powder and some breadcrumbs as other reviewers had suggested. Used a whole chicken. The best pieces were the drumsticks (very tender) and the wings--seems the most tastiest pieces were the bone-in ones--took the bones out of the breasts and thighs. Served with homemade mac n cheese and a salad and we all enjoyed it. Thanks Anika!

I followed some of the suggestions (boiling the chicken for a bit, dredging it in flour before the egg and parmesan cheese) and it turned out very well.  One critique I had:  it tasted too salty to me so the next time I make it I will omit the salt.  Other than that it was a very good and easy dish.

I made this on the Weber (on the 4th of July) - baked with grill covered for about 45 minutes.  These turned out excellent - I added a little grill chicken seasoning with the Parmesan, salt and pepper.  Will be making this again!

Came out great! I did add garlic powder, adobo, and bread crumbs to the parmesan cheese mixture. Also seasoned my chicken ( I always do) w/ paprika, salt & onion powder. But overall it was wonderful. Will definitely be making again. *Thanks for the recipe*

4 stars for the the simplicity of the recipe. Nothing spectacular, but it filled the craving for Parmesan Chicken when I didn't have bread-crumbs, and using just cheese and spices gave it a biting taste!

Very good and easy to prepare.  I added the bread crumbs as others suggested and used it on skinless breast.  This also works well as a coating for fried chicken.

This recipe was great, although I did follow some of the other users' advice, and added some dried basil, dried oregano, and bread crumbs to the cheese mix. I also coated the drumsticks in flour before the egg--as per another user's advice--but next time, I would omit the flour, because it turned out just slighty too floury.

I thought this was just ok. I used some breadcrumb as well, but I found that it didn't get very brown and crispy on the chicken. I don't think I will make this again.

I liked this recipe. The flavor was unique.  I really like that it got crispy. The chicken got very juicy!

The first time, I made this, it was WAY to spicky with a tsp. of pepper, especially for my son. I took out the pepper the next time and added a tsp of Italian seasoning. My whole family loved it!  Easy to put together and throw in the oven!

Very good recipe! I added an Italian seasoned bread crumbs to the cheese and a dash of seasoning salt. It came out super-tasty but I think next time I will try it on bonless/skinless breasts.

Fantastic! My husband was thrilled with dinner tonight. Another reader recommended adding breadcrumbs and garlic salt & onion powder which I did. This is now on our regular rotation.

This was wonderful. I love the recipe because it was quick and easy. The only thing I did differnt was I used seasoning salt. I didn't measure my seasoning salt nor my pepper. I just put enough in the cheese to make me feel comfortable.

I tried w/drumsticks then opted for boneless chicken. I sub'd 1c.Panko crumbs for 1c.parm.  Also flour dredged before egg dip per another reviewer.(Thanks!) The coating was crispy, crunchy and perfect to coat any fish or chicken.

I made this for dinner one night when I had company.  It was a hit!  My boyfriend was skeptical at first cause he thought it was just some cheesy chicken.  He was wonderfully surprised cause it wasn't what he was expecting.  It has a great taste to it.  I actually am thinking of making it again tonight for dinner.

This was awesome. My husband and i loved it.  We like Thighs so i used them instead of drumsticks.  I did take some of the suggestions. I added breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and oregano.  This recipe is a keeper in my house.

This was a huge hit at my house.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and I added red pepper flakes and Italian seasonings to the parmesan cheese.  The chicken was served on a large plater with my red sauce dribbled over it. It looked so pretty and my family ate it up.  This is a keeper!

I've made this Parmesan Chicken for dinner and it turned out absolutely great! The only thing is I strongly cut down on the Parmesan cheese, and added about 1/4 cup (the entire apartment smelled like Parmesan for hours, but you could barely taste it on the chicken). Also added other spices, such as Italian Mix, Oregano, extra Garlic & Pepper, and some Barbeque Mix spices. In general, baked for the required 45 minutes (6 drumsticks instead of 12), and they were DELICIOUS!

Very easy!! Very Good.  Even my husband said how good it was without being asked.  I'm a new cook and I had no problem making it.  Like others sais you don't need 2 cups of cheese I used just one with the same amount of salt/pepper.

Great chicken. I made a few changes- used 4 chicken breast. I used a mixture of parmesan, asiago & romano cheese that I found by "Frigo"- mixed this with about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. I covered the dish while it baked, and uncovered it for the last 10 minutes. I did not add any salt or spices- my 3 and 5 year olds both ate their entire piece!

This was a great way to make chicken, it's almost like fried chicken. I didn't use all the cheese that it called for(what a shame to waste so much cheese). Next time I will use 3/4 a cup.

A nice chicken change! Delicious for how easy and quick it was... will certainly be using again! I did find it a bit salty, but not a big deal. Will pass along to friends, and finally have a reason to buy drumsticks other than the fact that their inexpensive. Didn't alter the recipe at all, other than a little less cheese. (I was low.)

I should have read the reviews before I made this because I had to throw out so much of the cheese mixture.
As for the taste I would maek it again but maybe use some garlic like some other reviewers did. I also wouldn't use drumsticks again. I just don't like them.

this was an easy chicken recipe, but i didn't really like the drumsticks.  next time i'll use breasts.  i also added garlic powder for some extra flavor.  

if you do use drumsticks, i'd recommend losing the skin.

I didn't like this recipe but my boyfriend loved it. It was very quick and easy though. When I cooked it for the time shown, it was brown on top but wasn't cooked enough on the inside so I put it in for another 10-15 minutes. It was OK.

I don't really care for chicken legs but since we had them I made this recipe. Next time I'll use bonless chicken breasts just because I'll know they'll come out just as delicious. My husband and I ate all but 3 legs, they were so good, thanks!!!!!!

I added garlic salt, dried cilantro and a dash of cayenne to the cheese mixture and pulled the fat of the drumsticks.  I served the chicken on top of couscous and side of salad.  Great recipe, moist and juicy.

This is great! I was looking for foods to eat on the South Beach Diet (25 lbs and counting...) and this was perfect! I added some more spices to the chicken prior to dipping it in egg, like garlic powder, vegeta seasoning and paprika and it turned out juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside and flavourful. Will be making this often!

It's always nice to find a good chicken recipe. I used the 2 cups of cheese but would substitute a cup of bread crumbs next time to make it a little more cost effective. Very good though, I also will note when the chicken was served as a left over it was best reheated a little extra crisp as we found the batter to go a little soggy. Easy to make, nice flavor, if your reading this because your not sure if you should try it, give it a go, there's always room for one more chicken recipe!

FABULOUS!  Not only did my husband love them but my 1 year old loved them too.  This is the only meat I have been able to get him to eat.  Not only that, but my house smells incredible!

My husband and I thought this was very yummy, and it was SO easy to make!  The kids thought it was a little too peppery, but I can adjust that next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!
