We made these yesterday for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone kept telling me how delicious they were. I was very happy with the flavor...the orange compliments sweet potatoes very well. They were a bit of work..having to scoop out the inside of an orange isn't so easy. I ended up cutting them in half, squeezing the juice out and then peeled the rind away from what was left...much easier than trying to scoop it out with a spoon. I also did this part a day ahead and stored the prepared skins in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator. This saved me a lot of time when cooking them the next day. I used 1/2 of the sugar in the sweet potato mix and I'm glad I did because the topping is also very sweet..and I have a huge sweet tooth. Very, very good and worth the effort, in my opion. We will definitly be making these again! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

EXCELLENT!  A few years ago, I watched Emeril make Bourbon Street Sweet Potatoes so I decided to try them.  I never like sweet potatoes before that recipe.  I must say that I think this one beats Emerils.  A TIP, I had no orange juice so I cut my orange in half instead of just cutting the top off and then squeezed the juice to use and  scooped the rest out for my shell.  I see alot of people have complained about the time involved in the scooping, but I think if you do it the way I did, it would be much easier and quicker as you have more room to scoop.  I also was able to get two servings with one orange that way. Of course the portions would be smaller, so if you really like it, go for two servings!  I will definately make this again and again and certainly use it the next time I entertain!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These were FABULOUS and IMPRESSIVE! ...my recipe "keeper" of the season.  Th presentation was beautiful, and the oranges infused a bit (not too much) of orange flavoring throughout.  My kids are fighing over the leftovers now!  Just a hint when making:  Preparing the oranges can be tedious.  I started out scooping with a spoon to get the flesh out and finally resorted to using my (clean) hands to pull out all of the mushy stuff and skin inside - it went much faster.  Try these - you'll love them!!!  Oh, one other hint - try to cut your oranges so they are as stable as possible, otherwise the will roll over into the water (which is a shame with that yummy topping),  I made these a day ahead of time (sans the topping) and refrigererated; baked and added topping when ready to cook.

I actually made these last year, but forgot to review. They were amazing and I'll be making them again this year. Much better presentation and flavor than traditional sweet potato casserole. A few tips that made things easier for me:

The big tip I wanted to impart is that their is def. a science to scooping out the oranges. I know it isn't easy to explain but everything goes about 3x as quickly if you get in between the orange rind and the white skin covering the fruit using your finger. Then you can basically peel the orange out gently with your hand leaving a nice smooth orange rind bowl. A spoon or knife tends to puncture the white skin and makes it harder to get everything out and in the end you are stuck scraping with a spoon, and there are still bits of orange clinging to the inside and a lot more mess. The only problem with the quick method is that you have to be careful when you come to the bottom as you might accidentally remove the very bottom plug and your orange bowl will have a hole. The solution is to pinch that piece off when you are scooping/peeling. If you still accidentally tear out the little bottom part (which I did on one or two) it is all right, just wrap the oranges  loosely in some aluminum foil.

The second tip. I had some problems balancing my oranges in the pan and the water. I ended up putting aluminum foil around them (loosely) and then when I put them in the pan the foil allowed them to prop up against one another). They still cooked fine but I

This recipe had such a beautiful presentation!!! It really wasn't that hard or time consuming to prepare! I read all the reviews before hand and took the following suggestions - I cut the oranges in half and used a grapefruit knife to cut out the orange, making sure to keep the peel in-tack. I wrapped the sweet potatoes in foil and baked them for about 1 hour to keep them from absorbing too much water and to enhance their flavor. Once cooled, I just squeezed out the flesh - no peeling necessary. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I totally left out the butter - it did not need it, and boy did that save a lot of fat and calories! next time I will probably leave out the eggs as I thought they would hold the sweet potatoes more firmly together - but it did not make a difference - the texture was mushy so the eggs didn't add much. I added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture. As for the topping i wanted to make the topping as stated but I did not have whole pecans I made it with chopped nuts instead next time I will make it with the whole pecans. I used cut pieces of tin foil and wrapped it around the oranges as they baked so that the orange peel won't burn. If I don't use the eggs next time - i will just skip this step and not even bake the orange cups - as the filling was delicious before baked, and no eggs will lead me not to have to do this step. This got rave reviews from all of my guests! I will make it again.

EXCELLENT!!!!! Very well received at my Easter dinner last night! Everyone requested i make it for every holiday gathering! I made a few changes, as is my style, instead of the glaze, i made a streusel type topping with melted butter, oatmeal, brown sugar and chopped pecans. I sprinkled that over the top and it made a great topping! Also, a side tip, i used my juicer after cutting the oranges in half, i juiced them and used the orange juice in the potatoes and on the ham! It made the shelling a LOT easier as the juicer did all the work for me! Thanks again!

Marvelous!  I cut the oranges in half to make it easier to scoop out the flesh, then the bottoms in foil while baking.  This way the orange skin cooks in its own juice and you can eat the shell with the sweet potato filling.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to shell an orange.  These made a very impressive display and even the sweet potato haters loved these.  They did turn out a little too sweet for my taste (and I drink coffee with extra sugar!) so next time I will cut the sugar almost in half.  Definately try!

Wonderful!!  I served this Thanksgiving and had 3 recipe requests.  My 5 
children and a cousin that never ate, didn't like sweet potatoes, loved them
and asked for more.  Scooping out the oranges is a bit time consuming.  A
grapefruit spoon and kitchen shears help.

LOVE the orange infusion.  This is the only way my 14 year old son will eat sweet potatoes.  He loved the orange twist.  Probably would be just as good without the added sugar.  It was very sweet.  Very impressive presentation as well.   Keep in mind the size of your oranges... I bought oranges that were quite large and ended up barely having enough sweet potato mixture to fill them all appropriately.  This is THE recipe that my son will remember his Mom making during the holidays.  And, THE recipe that will haunt his future wife when he says... " I only like my Mom's sweet potatoes... can you make them like she did?"  Hee Hee!

These were fantastic and eveyone raved about them.  I pretty much followed the recipe as this was the first time I had made these, but next time I think I would half the sugar and butter in the sweet potato filling and I think at least half the topping recipe.    I made the filling two days before my dinner and then stored it in the refridgerator.  On the day of, I cleaned out the oranges and then filled and baked them.  It didn't seem like that much work to me at all, especially since you could do a lot of the work beforehand.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll definitely make these again.

Prepared 24 of these for Christmas Dinner Party. They were a huge hit! Like others said, even the guests that said they normally don't lik sweet potatoes loved them! I prepared the oranges the day before and stored, covered, in the fridge. I made it really easy and quick, by using cannned sweet potatoes!!! They were awsome! I cut back on the sugar (like everyone else).  I made the recipe for 17 servings and it filled 24 oranges. So, I must agree with others that this recipe makes more than needed! The topping recipe made so much that I have enough left to cover about 10 cinnammon rolls. Used a graetfruit spoon to clean out shells. Mixed the oranges that I scooped out with greatfruit and sugar for a fruit salad. I added a mini marshmellow to the top @ the last few minutes and stuck the garnish on top. My pecans were candy coated...yummy!  I will make again!

I think I'll try i\t in a casserole type dish next with with the orange rinds on the bottom. Scoop out everything but the rinds & voila. Less work but not as pretty as the whole orange rinds.

I made this for Xmas, what a hit! I cut the oranges in half and filled them the night before with the mixture. The recipe makes quite a bit of filling. I took the extra and filled a small casserole dish with it. On Xmas I made the sauce and topped the oranges and extra dish I had made. I baked everything and it all came out yummy! I did put the orange bottoms in foil so they would not brown and look pretty when they were done baking. I pulled off the foil when they were done and served. Everyone raved and raved about them !!

These are lovely! I served them Christmas Eve alongside pork roast and green beans. Only problem was stirring the brown sugar into the melted butter; it separated (maybe I had the heat too high?). It was difficult to spread on the mashed sweet potatoes, but the presentation was beautiful and they tasted great. Note: if you cut too much off the bottom of your orange, and a hole appears when you remove the fruit, just wrap the bottom of the orange half in a little foil, then place it in the water bath. Keeper!

Exceptional presentation! They looked beautiful on the table. I brought them to my boyfriends family for Christmas dinner. Many of his family member are great cooks. They knew I spent a good amount of time on the preparation. I juiced and gutted the oranges the day before in front of the TV, I was done before I knew it. I used others advice and halved the sugar. I didnt know how to grate an orange peel so I just threw one that i had made a hole in into the food processor. The sweet and bitter flavors went very well together. I didnt make the topping. Instead I just placed the pecans on top and sprinkled brown sugar on them before I baked them. Was amazing. I will make them again for a special occasion

My gosh, where do I start? My hubby said it was a 4 or 5, but I couldn't agree. I will make again, but with out all the work. I didn't use as much sugar or butter as called for & will cut back more as I thought it was way to sweet. I won't put in the orange shells either, even though it did look nice, it was a big hassle. We did both agree the orange flavor mixed with the sweet potato was nice & so that is what I'll go off of.  I'll mash the sweet potatoes, use less butter & sugar, put in ramekins (for cuteness) & put in a larger dish for the water bath. For the topping I'll use less also to keep the over powering sweetness done.

These sweet potato's are so good! My husband who is not the biggest fan of even candy sweet potato's loved them. I followed the recipe to a T the fist time I made them and they were so good, but towards the end my husband and I felt like it was a little to much because of all the butter and sugar that is put in them.
Because you put brown sugar on the top I reduced the amount of white sugar that is put in the potato's to at least 1/2 a cup. If you want it less sweet put only 1/4 cup in with the potato's. Also if you want you can reduce the butter down to 3/4 cup as well. That makes them a little less fating but still really good.

Everyone at Easter dinner loved this, but we made a few changes.  We only used about 3/4 the recommended sugar and half the butter and left the topping off completely and it still came out very, very sweet.  Definitely more of a dessert than a side dish.  Next time I'll probably only use 1/4 of the recommended sugar, stick with 1/2 the recommended butter, and use a tiny bit of brown sugar for topping.
I also took another reviewer's suggestion and cut the oranges completely in half, cut the pulp from the rind, and then scooped, which was really easy.

This was absolutely fabulous!  My hubby said it's the best new recipe that I've tried and I try a lot of wonderful new recipes.  I didn't put it into the orange shells, although I'm sure it's a beautiful presentation.  I also cut out a little of the butter and sugar.  This is definately a keeper!  Thank you so much, Louise!

This was really good, but a little too sweet for my family. I would make it again, but i would add half the white sugar that it calls for. The nut topping was so good! It tastes wonderful with the sweet potato.

These are exceptional.  A little time consuming to make, but extremely impressive!  I make them for Christmas every year, and they are talked about all year long.

This recipe was a huge Thanksgiving hit.  I used half as much sugar and it was perfect.  I will use this recipe again and again.

This was AMAZING! I skipped the topping, and used brown sugar instead of white. I also set them on muffin tins and covered with foil to bake which increased the baking time to 45 minutes.

I very unique side dish. It is somewhat time consuming and should be prepared in advance.  When you scoop out the orange, there normally is a hole in the bottom of the shell where the naval was. I put a small piece of yellow duct tape over the home to keep the water out when during the baking process.

Unique and appealing to the eye and with great flavor for the taste buds what more could u ask from a sweet potato? I used a curved grapefruit knife to remove the flesh from the orange. Just half the orange and place them in a ramekin in a cooking tin filed with a 1/2 inch of water--this will prevent tip overs. Great recipe thanks

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! They look really impressive and the recipe is really very simple. My family loved them although they were a touch too sweet- even for my sweet tooth! 
The topping is basically pure sugar, but it was actually the sweetness of the filling that started to get a bit sickly towards the bottom. The topping we really liked because it tastes like a fudgey caramel and crystallizes around the nuts.
Next time, I will only use 1/2 cup of white sugar in the filling.

We loved this new twist on sweet potatoes. My oranges were small, so I only cut the top quarter off.  I used a grapefruit spoon to remove the flesh from the shell and it was pretty easy; just like cleaning a little jack-o-lantern.  I got enough juice from the oranges to use that in the recipe, and I cut the sugar in half.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had.  They were FABULOUS!

Excellent recipe.  The orange and vanilla compliment the sweet potato perfectly.  Cut down the sugar to about a third to begin with and add more to taste.  While eating if you scrape the sides of the orange their is a very mild bitterness which balances perfectly with the sweet filling.  This is only time consuming if you are making a large amount.  From preparation to finish I was finished in  just under an hour.  Cut the oranges in half and use the juice from inside.  Squeeze them a little and the inside should come out easier.

Great recipe, i did some things differently:  used 1/4 c. butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, used store bought toffee pecans on top.  I could'nt get all the of the pulp out of all the oranges, and those turned out better!  The ones i cleaned out perfectly to the pith were actually not so great, the bitterness flavored the potato. The oranges i left a little membrane and pulp were delicious!

this was a great tasting unusual addition to my thanksgiving dinner. i put each serving in ramekins, so everyone had their own. Everyone LOVED it! just a little sweet ( and i like sweet things). i chilled the pecan mixture overnight so they hardened, and then microwaved them in the morning so soften up and be placed on the sweet potato as pictured. otherwise the sweet mixture is too thin and will not look like the picture. they looked fantastic on the table.

I made these for Christmas. They were absolutely delicious. I used the orange juice from the orange in the potatoes. I added a couple mini marshmallows on top followed by pecan. They looked lovely on the table. They will become a holiday favorite!

I made these for Christmas lunch and they were fantastic.  Everyone loved them and they were so impressive to serve.  Unlike other reviews, I didn't find it hard to scoop out the oranges at all, and I only cut down about half an inch.  I used a dessert spoon with quite square edges which might have been what made it easier. I have a big sweet tooth so I made the recipe as is (and it was delicious) but next time I will do as some others suggest and cut the sugar in half and decrease the butter as I don't think either of those things would affect the taste much at all. I kept the oranges standing upright by fitting them in tightly next to each other in the casserole dish and didn't have any problems with the water in the dish this way.  Next time I might trim a little flat bit on the bottom to make it easier for guests to keep still on their plates though. I made the recipe the day beforehand (minus the topping) and then made the topping and baked on the day, which worked really well. I also think I might play around the topping next time as well.  The pecans are great and I think some cinnamon would compliment them well. A really impressive recipe.

Used more sweet potatoes, half sugar, more butter (oops, didn't read the instructions first), less rind, less topping. So delicious and pretty! Will make it a Christmas tradition.

We have a recipe very close to this one that has been in our family for years. We put the mashed sweet potatoes in a sauce pan and add all the ingriedients and heat till bubbling. then plce the orange halves on a baking sheet top with mini marshmellows put in a 350 oven till the marshmellows are brown on top. Fast easy and no water to mess with.

Wonderful recipe.  Everyone loved the different way to have sweet potatoes.  I did make a couple of minor changes... brown sugar instead of white, and decreased to half a cup as recommended by other reviewers.  I also did not put nuts on top because of an allergic guest.  I had a little bit of left over filling and just baked it in a ramekin alongside the oranges... it was FABULOUS that way, too.... so next time if I don't want to bother with the oranges, I'll just prepare it that way.

Personally, I thought this was one of the easiest recipes and it is the most delicious I have ever had!!!!! I did have a guest tell me it was too sweet and another tell me it would be a great dessert. But, I do have a huge sweet tooth and it was just perfect in my opinion! I have to add that I used the fresh squeezed oj from when I was hollowing out the oranges; very tasty!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I cut big navel oranges in half...easy to pull out the  flesh...I cut back on the sugar to 1/3 c and next time I will cut back a little more.  Also  found the  sugar topping too much, to over the top sweet plus a waste of 1 cup of pricey pecans. Next time I will sprinkle a little brn sugar on top and place pecan halves or sprinkle chopped pecans on top.  They present beautifully and I am making this again for Easter Dinner.

I tried this recipe last year for Thanksgiving but due to a mishap with the oven we weren't able to try them but I was told they were good.  I did make them again at this years Thanksgiving and had to triple the recipe.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of both sugars and they still came out pretty sweet but again tastey.  So, I would cut back more on both the white sugar, brown sugar and also the number of eggs when tripling this recipe.

This recipe is Amazing, yummy, and such a neat idea.  I didn't have OJ like another reader so I cut my oranges in half and used the juice.  

A helpful tip for getting all the pulp out, I was able to turn my oranges inside out and once I did that the cleaning out process went much easier and faster.

Wonderful!  I always try to include one new recipe for thanksgiving and this one was it.  It was such a big hit it has made its way into our traditional meal for years to come.  I ran out of oranges and used the rest of the filling and the topping in a casserole dish and also came out nice if you are looking for a quicker option.

I have a very large family, so I made over 40 oranges.  They were the biggest hit if the holiday.  They have now become the Thanksgiving tradition.

I made this as a side dish for a vegetarian dinner party.  I thought it went over well.  It was too sweet for some of my guests, others really liked it.  I thought it was great, and a great presentation.  Very unique!

Excellent.  I used half the butter and white sugar but added a shot of rum to the glazing.  I have prepared it several times for guest and special occasions with everyone asking for more.

Everyone loves these and since I started making them about 6 years ago, my dad has to have them every Thanksgiving and Christmas. The one thing that I do not like about making them is the tedious part of scraping out the oranges but the kids like it because they can eat all the insides. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these last year for Thanksgiving bruch, and the kids DEMANDED that I make them again this year!! They were a bit too sweet and orangy for my taste, so this year, I omitted the OJ and cut back to half the sugar. The best tip from the reviews: To scoop out the oranges, use your thumbnail inside the peel, push toward the center in a spiral motion. The stem side comes cut cleanest if using navel oranges.

Hard to fail and a hit among our friends! Instead of baking it in oranges, my husband and I baked the batter in cupcake holders for the same length of time. It made 24 servings. We also added a dab of grated orange peel on top.  Who would've thought such a combo of oranges & sweet potato would go this well together!

As stated, I give it 4 stars. I only used 1/2 the amount of recommended sugar, and it was FABULOUS, definitely 5 starts! Oh my goodness, nothing but rave reviews at Christmas dinner. I wound up with lots of leftover potato mix and not enough oranges to fill, so I baked it like sweet potato pie for another potluck party with a candied pecan topping.

Cut butter and sugars in half, added some oatmeal to the topping, and this was amazing.  Picky eaters at the table and not a dab left in anyone's orange shell.  This will be a regular at the holiday table.  

Noting the reviews of others, I cut the oranges in half, juiced them and pulled the pulp right out.  I planed the bottoms just a tad to level them in the pan.  The shells stored easily in the frig overnight.  This was an easy, winning dish.

I love sweet potatoes, but even my friends and family who do not typically care for sweet potatoes love this dish.  It is a nice alternative to the marshmallows.  I use half the sugar.  I also do not carve out the oranges because it is pain.  I just fix the first part according to the recipe, scoop the potatoes into a casserole, layer some pecans on the top, pour brown sugar and butter over the top, and bake in the oven until done.

These were amazing!! I made them the day before Thanksgiving and reheated them before dinner. Everyone raved! I didn't chop the pecans and put them in with the sugar, instead I copied the pic and put halves on top. I also didn't try to peal the full orange, but cut them in half instead and peeled them with my fingers very, very slowly to make sure I got all of it. I also saved as much of the juice I could and we had a couple of glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice! I will definitely make these again, even though it is a bit time consuming :)

Great recipe!  One thing that keeps triggering me though is the nutritional information on the side- there is no way this is 900+ calories per serving!  1 cup of mashed sweet potato is only 180 cals.  There's a little sugar and a little butter but no cream or anything.  I'm thinking that's the total recipe amount.

i have made this dish twice now and both times it has turned out sub par. it is not a bad dish it just lacks in a little bit of everything. one thing that i can say for sure is make sure that you do not use splenda brown sugar in this recipe.

Soooo good, but darn sweet! I cut the oranges in half, juiced them and cleaned out the insides then stored them in the fridge overnight. It made Thanksgiving day prep much easier! I followed this recipe exactly and everyone loved them, but I think I will cut the sugar in half next time. I also forgot to put water in the bottom of the casserole dish, but it didn't make any difference. Thanks for the fun holiday recipe!

I had left over potatoes so I cooked them in a casserole dish around the oranges that we stuffed with the potatoes.  They ended up having the same orange flavor.  I will be using this recipes again.

These have been so much fun to prepare - I haven't tasted them yet, but the process has been fantastic. I had great luck using my grapefruit knife and serrated-edged spoon to prepare the orange shells. Plus, this side dish is worth it visually. What a beautiful addition to our Seder table!

I loved this idea for a fancy side dish.  It was time-consuming and messy to prepare and I think people at the party were afraid to try them!  They tasted good, but I don't think the orange peel really added much flavor.  And leftover, the peel started to disintegrate and made the potatoes bitter!  Fun idea, but not worth it.  Next time I'll just make the "Sweet Potato Classic" casserole.  It's delicious!

Excellent.  I cut the sugar by half, forgot to put water in the pan, still turned out great.  Had extra potatoes that I served from a casserole dish without the topping, it was wonderful as well.

I made this for my in-laws for Thanksgiving.  It was a show-stopper! My husband's grandmother couldn't stop complimenting me! Next year, I may have to make a double patch.  My only complaint is the time it took to prepare the oranges.  I prepared them and the potatoes the night before to speed it up.  Thanks!

I hate sweet potatoes but this was unbelievable. I doubled the recipe, and baked the left over in an extra dish so i had the oranges for presentation, and the rest for seconds! They went over huge and looked like much more trouble than they really were

Very good!  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe and put half in oranges and the other half in a baking dish and used the same topping on both.

This recipe was sawesome. Probably the best sweet potato dish I've ever put ont he table. Everybody raved. The only problem, and it might prohibit me from making them again, was the hulling of the oranges. It was messy and took a long time. Perhaps there's any easier way and I just don't know it. Regardless, this dish was superb!

Made them for Thanksgiving.  The adults loved them, but the kids said they were too sweet (I think they were just being picky).  They are very sweet, but will make again only with less sugar.  Or will serve them as a dessert.  Either way this is definately a recipe to try.

This is simply amazing. I've never reviewed a recipe from this site before, but these just got so many compliments I couldnt help it! The only changes I made were to make a streusel/crumb topping (easier, cheaper, and I LOVE stresel/crumb toppings) and used a little more mashed sweet potato than called for, and probably a little less butter. I multiplied the recipe by 4, so I made 26 whole-filled oranges- I figured everyone needed their own! SO time consuming with cleaning the oranges, but the taste was definitely worth it! 

MAKE THESE!

I cut the orange in half like shown in the picture.  I would cut the sugar and butter in half next time.  As prepared in the recipe it would be suitable for a desert.  Needs some flour or starch to thicken the mixture.

This is a fabulous recipe.  It is time consuming though to scoop out the oranges.  However, it was worth it.  The presentation was nice and I had guests telling me they don't even like sweet potatoes but they liked these.  I am making these again tomorrow for Christmas dinner.

These are to die for, especially if you like orange. To be honest, the presentation for serving is the main reason for using the orange halves as bowls. I’ve also made it at a big batch and it tasted just as good. Just make sure it’s a shallow pan, so you get a good nut crust for each spoonful. But nothing beats the individual orange bowls to impress those guests!

Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and everyone really liked it---especially my husband.  He asked me to make it again.  We loved the combination of orange and sweet potatoes.  Didn't change a thing.

This made a delicious side dish! I cut my oranges in half and used a serrated knife to cut out most of the insides, but left some of the pulp intact. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the full cup of white sugar. I mounded the sweet potato filling pretty high and didn't add any topping. The house smelled great, the stuffed oranges were unusual and beautiful, and my husband loved them! He said the sweet potatoes were most intensely flavored by the orange pulp I had left in the orange halves, so I might leave even more pulp in the next time I make these. The filling was soft, but the leftovers (there was one) were firm. It reheated well, so perhaps you could make them ahead and reheat for firmer filling. My husband put a reminder in my phone to serve these for Thanksgiving.

I followed quite a few suggestions, and they were all combined to make a perfectly delicious side dish!  I mostly followed suggestions from chef4Six, thank you!  First of all I prepared my fresh sweet potatoes a day ahead by wrapping each one in foil and baking them at 350 for an hour and letting them cool completely before unwrapping, and gently removing the skin. I saved the meat in a container in the fridge.  In a mixing bowl, I used a fork to easily mash  the sweet potatoes then added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup of butter . I omitted the eggs completely.  Instead of store bought orange juice, I used the juice from the oranges, and the zest from an extra orange I had purchased in case I messed up one of the shells. I used a melon baller to scoop out the oranges, and it worked like a charm, a paring knife helped me to cut the center stem from a few of the insides. I left a little of the meat in the shells, which only enhanced the flavour. For the top, with so much sugar already used, I merely sprinkled a little brown sugar on top of the pecan halves, keeping the pattern louise b. (the original recipe contributor) submitted. They came out beautifully, and not overly sweet.

out of this world!!!!  made them for Thanksgiving,  Lots  of work but i am thankful my family will be together ,as a Canadian we have a day called  Remembrance Day Nov 11th  to show love and respect for those who didn't return home after fighting in wars to save us. This would be a special treat for those who cared enough to give their very best,  their lives , for us they left behind.

trader joe's has frozen sweet potato medallions which work out great as the already mashed cooked potato.  do make sure to use fresh not from concentrate oj or you get that baby aspirin thing.  Ditch the extra sugar and you could have a 5.

I've made these for Thanksgiving several times.  They're always a hit.  The orange flavor is wonderful, and the presentation (imho) is sort of elegant.  I love sweet things so I use candied pecans instead of plain pecans. Yumm-o!

This has become a Christmas tradition. I have to make extra for my niece to take home with her.  I cut the sugar by half in the potatoes, and skimp on the crumble to keep the sugar levels down.

Haves the butter and sugar and only used brown sugar. I also halved the butter. I also used very little orange zest...3 sprinkles. It was very good but the oranges were to much work.

Used Japanese sweet potatoes. Everybody just loved it. I did not hollow out the orange...wish I had. Exquisite!

I loved this recipe and I used a juicer to remove the pulp and at the end of the sweet potatoes the orange that was left behind was delicious but time I'm going to put a little sugar down there next to the sweet potato with little nutmeg. But the main thing is to use a knife to serrate the top to make it look amazing and to put the knife all the way through so that it will come apart

This is a visually beautiful dish.  Just served it for Christmas dinner.  It certainly made for a beautiful table beside a top notch prime rib.  Few notes, next time I would cut the white sugar by half.  I have a sweet tooth and they were still a bit too sweet for me.  I also would cot the oranges in half as was previously suggested.  This makes a better serving size (I bought really big oranges) for light eaters and children.  I definitely will make again.

I made this for Christmas Eve for my boyfriend's family and seriously this was truly an awesome recipe and it turned out AMAZING, it is also sweet enough to be used as a dessert as opposed to a side dish... Thanks for the recipe

WOW!!! These were such a treat.  I usually do something to make a recipe my own but this time I decided to follow it to a T.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The orange flavor, sweetness, and presentation make for a a perfect holiday side.  I will definitely make this again.

Question:  I sometimes substitute applesauce for butter in cake/muffin recipes to reduce the amount of fat.  Could you could substitute 1/2 cup applesauce for the butter in the sweet potato mixture and use 1/2 cup butter for the topping?

I decided to try this for something different at holidays...awesome! The mix of sweet potato & orange is delightful to the taste buds. If you haven't tried this recipe you are missing out on great flavor and they are sooo easy to make.

My family loved them. They are still talking about the sweet potato oranges. The zest from the oranges gives the sweet potato a amazing taste. Love and will definitely do it again.

This recipe was a lot of work and WAY to sweet.  It barely kept any of the sweet potato flavor.  It tasted more like an orange cream-sicle.  It may have been better without the sugar, but it was so much work that I don't think that I will try it again.  A tip if you do make it, you don't really need much water in the bottom of the pan, to much makes it difficult to get the oranges out without getting the filling wet.

This is an excellent recipe.  This Thanksgiving I'm going to use baked and hollowed out mini-pumpkins (the kind you usually use for decorations) and fill them with this mixture.  I will add the baked portion from the pumpkins too.  Yellow vegetables are good for you.

Three stars for creativity and presentation, but the orange flavor was overpowering and they were just a little too sweet for a side dish.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be making these again - perhaps something similar looking, but with a little less sugar and without the orange peel.

Delicious!  I was a little nervous about hulling the oranges, but I used a grapefruit knife, and it was done in five minutes!  My family is small so I halved the recipe and ended up with leftover stuffing, so i filled two small ramikens and it turned out well. 

 Like other reviewers I also lessened the amount of sugar, and it was still plenty sweet.  The only problem I had was with the topping, but that was my mistake, not the recipe, and to be honest, we didn't miss it, and will probably leave it off next time!

I am Kraft Dinner kind of cook and I found this recipe to be pretty straight forward.  Yes, the oranges are a pain, but they are do-able and look purty.  I made 24 of these and found I had an excessive amount of topping after multiplying the recipe, so perhaps that could be scaled back.
Also, I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar in half which I think was a good idea as they were already quite sweet.
