Absolutely FABULOUS.  After making this, I don't think I can ever eat store bouught again.  I didn't have some items so I substituted.  I used rice wine vinegar, red onion, garlic aoili mustard and dark brown sugar.  I think the buttermilk and mustard really makes this recipe special.

I have been looking for a decent cole slaw recipe for ages and this is the closest to being the best (so far).  I used half and half instead of buttermilk and I used green onion instead of a regular one.  I also added diced red pepper and poppy seed.  It turned out good but next time I would add about a tablespoon more brown sugar and mayo.

I had to use no added sugar soy milk since I did not have buttermilk and it still came out great! My husband loved it too!

This coleslaw is amazing. The dressing is tangy and has a bit of a pop from the dijon. Many of the commentators didn't use buttermilk, I think the buttermilk is definitely great in this. The only change I made was to make my own cole slaw mix from fresh veggies - 1/2 a very small red cabbage, 1/2 a medium green cabbage, and 2 good sized carrots. I used an 1/8" slice on the mandolin for the cabbage and the julienne setting for the carrots. My husband took a taste before dinner and asked me why we ever buy cole slaw from the store. We won't anymore.

This was excellent!  I didn't have buttermilk so used 2% milk and used 1/4 cup non-fat plain yogurt and 1/2 cup light mayo instead of the 3/4 cup mayo in the recipe.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Deeelicious! Made it exactly as written, except i only had dark brown sugar. I do not like cole slaw that is too sweet, and this was a nice balance between tangy and sweet. This is my go-to cole slaw recipe from now on. YUM!

Bursting with flavor! My father is a self proclaimed cole slaw connoisseur, and after tasting this recipe he will never go back to any other cole slaw. The apple cider vinegar really does give it that extra zip without overwhelming the dish.

My husband said, "Throw your other coleslaw recipes out & keep this one."                                     Used whole milk mixed with cider vinegar & it was fine.                                                                 Scallions or green onion gave it a milder flavor but have also used Vidalia.                                          You may store it in a jar for future use on a busy day.  I also use whatever mustard I have on hand with great results.

I made this Atkins-like by using stevia and only 1T brown sugar. Also, had only balsamic vinegar. It turned out great!

I had to make some changes, based on what I had, but I thought this was great!  I used white sugar instead of brown and white vinegar instead of apple cider (I didn't have either of the ingredients, unfortunately.)  I thought the mustard added a nice tang and the onion was a nice, but not overpowering touch.  I will certainly make this again - thanks!

Seriously the best Cole slaw I have ever tasted! You will not be disappointed! My husband and kids all raves about it as well. Have shared this recipe several times already. Made it exactly as shown in recipe except for omitted parsley because I forgot to buy it. So darn delicious!

I don't care for coleslaw and I like this one.  And I haven't even rested it yet!  I didn't have buttermilk and substituted 2%.  No red onion so I used sweet white onion.  The rest is the same.  Yummy

Made the dressing as written and it was delicious.  I finely shredded green and red cabbage and used matchstick carrots, which is much better than bagged coleslaw mix!

Great as  it is!  It has character! Next time I will  decrease the brown sugar in half as I prefer slightly less sweetness  and I will add poppy seeds for eye appeal. Better than any other Cole Slaw recipe I have tried! Thanks!

This was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving party but I found it a bit too tangy. Next time around I'll only use 2 tablespoons instead of 3.

This is good! I used it as a base. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 3 tbsp light sour cream and about a teaspoon of Half n Half. I left out the onion but added about a half teaspoon of celery seed, something I remember my mom doing. Tea

This is my new go-to recipe for traditional-style cole slaw.  The mustard gives it 'pop', while the apple cider vinegar comes through subtly by nicely.  I used yellow mustard instead of dijon (for the kids)...it worked great, but I want to try the dijon.  I also left out buttermilk (didn't have any handy) and used coconut sap sugar for the sweetner.  Personally I'll back off on the sweetner next time and perhaps add a tiny bit more vinegar.

This was pretty good, although I didn't have everything. I subsituted apple cider vingar for Balsomic and Dijon mustard for Goldens. It was a nice twist. I gave this 3 stars cause I didnt have everything, I'm sure this would deserve 5 if I did.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  We had it with pulled pork and baked beans.  
I wouldn't change a thing.

I followed the reciple, however I didn't use buttermilk, and I added red cabbage as well as a bit more carrots.  It turned out amazing, and I'll never go back to store bought!!  Thanks for sharing :)

Our favorite cole slaw recipe.  I use slightly less sugar and use reduced fat buttermilk (that’s all I  can ever find in the store).  It’s even better the second day.

Real similar to the one I make.  Question I have is why did you put Cole Porter name on it.  This is not a recipe that he used.  He is a relative of mine and the family knows nothing of him using this recipe. Just curious....

I made this recipe exactly according to the recipe except I had to substitute milk for buttermilk because I didn't have any.  This was my first time to make cole slaw and it was delicious!

This coleslaw was very good. My husband is the coleslaw connoisseur, but he gave it only 4 stars. I'd make it again, though.

Simple and yummy!  I added a hearty shake of black pepper  to the creamy mixture and (based on other recipes) a squirt of fresh lemon juice over the top at the end , mixed to combine.

This was a good recipe.  I will be using it again. One nice twist I learned from a local restaurant is to add a few roasted peanuts to the Cole slaw. Yum!

Him:  What did you do differently to the coleslaw??
Me:  I decided to try a new recipe.  
Him:  Throw out the old one!!

I used a bag of regular slaw mix and one of broccoli slaw; didn't double the recipe (didn't change anything else), and it was fantastic!!  I'll never use the "old recipe" again!

It was good but it was a little too tangy for us. I added sugar but it still didn't quite do it for us. It might have been due to our wine vinegar so I might try this recipe again with different vinegar.

Really good! and since milk mixed with vinegar makes buttermilk, you can just use regular milk and an extra splash of vinegar.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used the fresh basil that I did have. Used packaged broccoli slaw and it all worked out just fine. Will make this again and again.

This was so awesome and easy! My husband made it to put on top of the Slow Cooker Pulled Pork with root beer and it was perfect! This will definitely be our coleslaw recipe from now on. We made it exactly as it said (surprisingly, we had everything on hand).
