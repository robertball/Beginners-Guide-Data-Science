This is a great starter-recipe.  I've made several changes, and it turned out beautifully: 8oz. of egg noodles were boiled and placed in the bottom of a casserole dish.  I then put in the frozen broccoli along with a few sliced carrots.  I browned the meat with the onions and added a few cloves of garlic as well as a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  I used a Cheddar-Jack mix and reduced the cheese from FOUR CUPS (woah!) to about two.  This recipe is very versatile and there are a countless number of things that can be added or substituted.  Delicious and very easy to make!

This was really good but I added two chopped potatoes in place of the mushrooms.  Without that change I think it would have been more like soup so I'm giving it only 4 stars.  My husband really enjoyed this meal and I cut the recipe in half and it was just the right size casserole for myself, husband, and our 2 year old.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt for a little more flavor.

I liked the recipe, but personally thought it needed a little tweaking.

It tasted a bit like a deluxe baked potato, without the potato.  I think I will make it again, only try it over mashed potatoes or maybe tater tots or something.

I also thought the broccoli turned out a little squishy.  I think I will half cook it next time.

All in all, a keeper, though I seemed to make a great mess to make it all.

I've made this twice now. First time, exactly as written, and we found it a little on the bland side and kind of boring. So, I made some modifications tonight. Both times I have to half the measurements for the beef (1 pound), broccoli (14oz frozen chopped broccoli), onion(1/2cup)because it's just 3 of us in the house. Tonight, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, 1 can of cream of broccoli soup, 1 cup of sour cream, added seasoned salt and pepper to the meat while browning along with the onion and 2tsp of minced garlic. I sliced 4 small red new potatoes (skins left on for color contrast), microwaved for 5 minutes with seasoned salt and pepper sprinkled over them to help get them done quicker. Mixed soup/sour cream mixture, meat, and potatoes into a 9x13 casserole dish stirred well then sprinkled with 1 small can of french fried onion strings for some crunch. Left out the cheese this time as it is creamy enough with the soup mixture. Baked uncovered at 350 for 20-30 minutes. Thanks for a great base recipe.

When I started cooking this recipe, I thought I had cream of celery soup in the pantry.  I was wrong!  I ended up substituting cream of mushroom instead.  I also used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and colby/jack cheese mix.  Does it still count as the same recipe even with all the changes?  Either way, it turned out great.  I served it over rice.  YUM!

I liked this recipe for it's good flavor and nice texture - but it was more like a "partial" casserole...it needed something more.  I think next time I'll make it and top it with Mashed Potatoes for a twist on Shepherds Pie or just add some egg noodles to help give it more substance.

This recipe was awesome! I added oregano and basil just for more flavor. I topped it with parmesan cheese at the end too. My husband and I both LOVED it!

Made this with fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I steamed it in the microwave until slightly cooked, then used in place of frozen. The amount of beef I used was 1 1/2 lb. instead of two pounds. Also, 16 oz. of Jack cheese is too much - I used about ten oz. Augmented the onion in the recipe with onion powder. The cheese was browned on the top after one hour, but not burned. This dish is definitely a keeper.

I was impressed by this recipe but my husband wasn't as much.  In the recipe's defense however, my husband doesn't like anything.  He didn't like the sour cream, soup, mushrooms or broccoli.  The only thing I changed was I chopped a potato and added that in as well.  I also cut down on the broccoli and cheese a bit.  It's a very filling comfort food style meal.

This is one of those recipes that is very forgiving of any changes. I’m moving in a few days and have been searching for recipes that will use up some of my “random” ingredients. This recipe helped out quite a bit. I halved everything and had to make some changes: dehydrated onion instead of fresh, shredded four-cheese Mexican cheese blend, no sour cream or mushrooms (didn’t have either). I did add in a bit of milk to make up for the lack of sour cream, though. I used Worcestershire sauce in addition to the S&P. I topped the cheese with a small can of French fried onions in the last five minutes. Also- I kept my broccoli frozen and it came out crisp tender after 35 minutes. My husband and I enjoyed it and will likely make it again. If you enjoy tater tot casserole, you’ll probably like this one too.

My picky husband and two-year old both loved this!  I substituted ground turkey and sour lean and used  fresh broccoli (steamed a bit first) and organic cream of celery soup.  We served it over egg noodles.

tasty, i would make again. I didn't have cream of celery so I used cream of mushroom. I browned the onion, mushrooms and added 1 garlic clove, dash of rosemary/thyme with the salt and pepper. I used fresh broccoli and carrots, steaming them in the microwave for about 7 minutes w/ ~ 2 tablespoons of water. I followed another reader's advice and added cooked egg noodle to the bottom of the dish. It was okay, they stuck together so it would have been helpful to toss w/olive oil or butter before the bake.

Personally, I don't think this recipe needs anything.  For someone who's watching their carbs, this is great.  I didn't miss the noodles, potatoes or rice in this casserole.  With the monterrey jack cheese, this was just right.  And since my husband is a carb-lover, I just served this with Texas Toast and he was a happy man.  Nice and hearty meal.

5 stars with these tweaks: add worcestshire, garlic, season salt & onion powder. Omit mushrooms. DO NOT cook the broccoli--add it frozen so it doesn't get mushy. Add Fried Oinions during the last 5 min. YUM!

This was truly a delicious recipe! My wife and I loved it! I only added two things: 2 tsp. minced Garlic and Worchestershire sauce (to taste). This was done while browning the meat. Only thing I changed was adding the cheese halfway through cooking time. This eliminated the 'overcooking' of the cheese. I also had NO problems with the broccoli being overdone. I put it in frozen and it came out perfect with a bit of crunch still in it! Overall, this really had great flavor and was asked to be cooked more often! Loved it!

This was great! Actually, after I fooled around with amounts and ingredients it was probably nothing like the original, but we enjoyed it. Here is what we added: celery (sauteed), Worcestershire, dry mustard, water chestnuts and brown rice. This would be a good recipe to add a multitude of vegetables. It's a keeper!

I made this recipe this past weekend, and followed the directions exactly as written.  The texture of the cassarole was quite soupy.  Due to this, my partner and I decided to eat this dish as a dip with white corn tortilla chips.  As a dip, it is fantastic!  (LOL)  My advice, if making this as a main course dish, is to pat-dry your broccoli once it has been steamed/cooked/boiled.  Also, I would recommend cutting the soup in half and using slightly less sour cream.  I think with those changes, the dish would come out more as a standard broccoli cassarole dish that's not too soupy.  :)

Great tasting and very easy to make.  I replace the condensed soups with a can of cheddar condensed and broccoli cheddar condensed for that extra cheese kick.

My whole family really liked this alot.   I did not have the mushrooms , so I didn't follow the recipe exactly but it was delicious, easy, and we will definitely make this again.  Next time I will add slightly more sour cream as I thought it a little dry. Tasted great, tho.  Thanks!

Well this was excellent, but I did change a couple of things. I couldn't find my celery soup, so I used my cream of broccoli.Then I microwaved 2 potatoes, cut them up and added them, also added a little hot seasoning (I'm married to a man that thinks everything should have that. He LOVED it.

This is a really great dish.  I have also made a few minor changes/additions. Used one can of soup, cooked noodles on the bottom, and topped the noodles with the steamed brocolli flowerets and some tiny baby carrots then put the hamburger mixture on top. Made a day ahead (or put in freezer), the flavors blend even more so and it becomes even more delicious. HIGHLY recommended by this Jedi!

This was pretty good!  My husband and I are trying to watch our carb intake so this really worked for us.  I didn't want to add potatoes, pasta or rice like a lot of folks did.  

To make it a bit less "fattening" I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream and used approximately 3 oz. of skim mozerella on top.

I didn't have any mushrooms, so I used 1 can of cream of celery & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Yumm!

Halved the recipe , and made as written. Not seasoned enough , and was more like a sauce than a casserole.  May try again, with a lot of seasonings, and added noodles, rice, or on top of some kind of potato.

GREAT with a couple of suggestions. My husband and I like a little spice, so I added about 2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I also added 2 tbs minced garlic. I put half the meat/soup/etc mixture in the baking dish, topped with half the cheese, topped with remaining meat mixture and the rest of the cheese. Served over mashed potatoes. I think next time I'll put mashed potatoes on top before the last half of the cheese. The starch really goes well with all the rest.

I thought this recipe was great ! but like alot of other viewers felt like it needs either potatoes, rice or noodles. I also feel like an hour cooking time is way too long. Everything is essentically cooked before it hits the oven. I only cooked mine 30 min.

This recipe came up during an ingredients search.  I used fresh broccoli and steamed it for a few minutes.  Next time, I won't steam it since it gets so soft during baking.  Per others' suggestions, I used half the sour cream and a lot less cheese (even though we're cheese lovers).  I spread cooked egg noodles on the bottom of a glass 13x9 pan.  I layered broccoli on that, and then the meat mixture.  Then topped off with cheese.  I baked for 50-minutes.  My husband and two picky eater sons all liked it.  It's pretty simple and a great way to get veggies and meats into the family.

Excellent comfort food!!  I used the suggestions by other reviewers and added crushed fresh garlic, basil, oregano, and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, but didn't reduce the amount of sour cream called for.  I served it with egg noodles, ceasar salad, and garlic bread - EXCELLENT!!

I was looking for something quick & easy - and this was it.  Based on other reviews I modified it this way.  I added some minced garlic & chopped mushrooms to the meat & onion mixture.  Additionally, I topped it all off with Fried Onions.  My family dug right into this dinner.  This isn't going to impress the socks off your dinner guests, but for a quick & hearty dinner for the family, it was great.

I loved this!  I used whole fresh mushrooms so that I could easily pick them out.  I did add just a touch of dry mustard and a little Worcestershire sauce, but even without them, it was still good!

A blander version of beef stroganoff that I usually do but the fresh broccoli I partially cooked gave it a nice touch.  I didn't have monterey jack cheese so used cheddar instead.  I served with rigatoni pasta and even my broccoli hating husband ate this.

We used fresh broccoli. Otherwise, I did this just as instructed. It's pretty fattening, but very tasty. We all liked it. It's very much like a beef stroganoff mix with broccoli and cheese on top.

I made this casserole for a family get-together dinner a while ago and it was a big hit.  The only variation from the recipe I made was omitting the mushrooms as I am allergic.  I had some of this dish left over, so I froze what was remaining in individual containers.  This casserole freezes, thaws, and reheats very well!

OK, I omitted the mushrooms and only used one lb. of ground beef, 1/2 cup of sour cream and tiny elbow macaroni on the bottom. I also added frozen corn and steamed butternut squash cubes with the fresh broccoli partly steamed. Baked for just 30 minutes and it was super tasty. A great base hamburger casserole with many yummy varitions!

Good but wouldn't be a fave of mine.  I made it as written with no exceptions except for using fresh broccoli. I steamed it about 5 minutes and wonder if I should have. It did heat up nicely in the nuker as leftovers.

Very good! I thought I had everything I needed, didn't even look, just got started. I didn't have the Cream of celery soup or any other! All I could find was a packet of Knor's Cream of Spinach dip mix. Heated it with a cup of milk and the sour cream. Put in a few spoonfuls of mayo too. Also short on cheese,so I sprinkled parmesan on top of the broccoli. I also put egg noodles on the bottom as suggested. Did have some grated colby jack for the top. Even though I had to make the changes it turned out great. I give it five stars for being so flexible! Thanks.   Two days later...  Been eating the leftovers, which has been good also, but I have a few thoughts about what I would change. Decided I didn't like the noodles on the bottom. Next time no noodles, or cooked seperately, buttered. They compacted on the bottom, didn't like that. Also I would not pre-steam the broccoli. I only steamed it quickly, but still the broccoli was too soft for my liking. I only had frozen broccoli, fresh might be better, still not cooked. I will make this again and another thank you for the post.

I will make this one again...my family loved it with the revisions that I made.  There was none leftover.  I had to make some revisions based on what I had on hand.  Plus, like other reviews it seemed to be missing something. I browned my ground beef with chopped onions and added salt, pepper, a little worcestershire sauce, garlic powder.  I used 1/2 package speghatti noodles cooked according to the directions and steamed some frozen broccoli.  In a separate bowl, I mixed two cups shredded cheddar cheese, 1 8 oz. sour cream, a little more worcestershire sauce, can of mushrooms undrained, and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  I put the noodles in the bottom of my pan and then mixed the meat, broccoli, and other ingredients together and placed on top.  I baked for about 15 minutes in the oven on 350.  I  served corn on the cob (with a little milk added to the water plus butter and salt) and breadsticks.  The kids loved it!!

I loved this casserole but did make a few changes. I followed others suggestions of serving over mashed potatoes. Trying to be conscious of saturated fats, I used only 1 can of mushroom soup (instead of celery) and half the amount of sour cream. This meal is delicious even without the cheese. I sprinkled seasoned pepper and beef bullion over the meat mixture. Next time I will try this with chicken. Thanks for the recipe, it is definately a keeper.

Rather bland.  I did replace the hamburger with turkey and 1 can of the cream of celery with a can of cream of mushroom.  It just seemed to be missing something.  Maybe a carbohydrate like hashbrowns would have done the trick.

I didn't care much for this recipe.  The cheese shouldn't have been added until the end, it was very brown and hard before the time was even up and i just didn't think it had much flavor.

This was a pretty tasty dish.  I made a few changes.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground turkey and added garlic. Only 8oz of Light sour cream, no salt and I added cut up potatoes and used onion powder instead of real onions because I was out.  I also used just 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and a couple splashes of chicken broth to make it spread better.  I only used 2 cups of cheddar cheese and threw a couple pieces of crumbled turkey bacon (left over from breakfast) on top.  I figure I cut down on about 200 unnecessary calories with a few easy changes.  And my husband renamed this the "Cluster Casserole" because you could add pretty much anything to it :).  Good basics, but nice to change it up to suit your needs.

Not good at all.  Makes a lot of casserole and most of ours will go in the trash can.  Far too much soup, far too little flavor.

I also put egg noodles on the bottom (3 cups precooked)and followed the rest of recipe except. Kept the perfectly steamed fresh broccoli separate (they will overcook)and used 1 cup of a soft cheese (forget name but like parmesean, definitely an italian cheese).  You can always mix the broccoli in at the end. It did taste like a "good" hamburger helper!

I omitted the mushrooms but used mushroom soup instead of celery soup.  It was easy and tasty but just a wee bit bland - but I also leave out the salt because my family overuses it on the table!  That might be all that was missing.  Will make again, everyone liked it even my "doesn't eat red meat" daughter!

This recipe is a keeper. The best part is that I already had most of the ingrediants on hand. I did cut the recipe in half as we are only a family of three. I added garlic powder to the meat mixture and omitted the mushrooms. Instead of having to bake it in the oven I ended up adding about one cup of milk to the skillet and brought it to a boil. I added the broccoli and reduce it to a simmer, covered and let it cook until the broccoli was tender. When it was ready I adjusted the seasonings and took another reviewer's advice and served it over baked potatoes and topped with cheese. It was excellent!

Very good.  Added cooked macaroni as base to casserole to give it more substance.  Also added a little bit of minced garlic, cheese, and mayo to noodles.  My boyfriend had thirds.

I liked this and followed the recipe as written except for three small changes.  I added a minced clove of garlic and cut the cheese in half.  Also, I didn't precook the broccoli, figuring an hour in the oven would suffice.  I served the casserole over rice and it was quite good!  Next time, I might use less sour cream.

This was pretty ggod especially considering that my family is pretty picky so I had to leave out the onion and the mushrooms.  I left everything else the same and it was good.  Better than hamburger helper that's for sure.

Really good!  Made it per the recipe - husband and kids (even picky 1 year old) loved it.  Seemed a little bland at first, so if you like dishes with a LOT of flavor, I would recommend doctoring it up.  But it worked at our house because it was just right for the kids' tastes.

Frozen Broccoli is all stem chunks and soggy/waterlogged. I did this using a large bunch of fresh florets.  If you cut them up and mix into the hot mixture before putting in the oven, it all cooks together and the Broccoli is fresh, tender-crisp

I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and didn't cook the frozen broccoli first, increased the noodles, used shredded cheddar and added garlic powder. I mixed the noodles and half of the cheese in with the hamburger mixture, then baked it for about 30 mins, added the rest of the cheese on the top and baked for another 10 minutes. This feeds about 10-12 people and is good when it is heated the next day.

I mixed 1 can of cream of mushroom with 1 can of cream of celery only because I need to go shopping! I was out of onions so added onion powder! I was out of fresh mushrooms but had a can of mushrooms And a mix of Monterey Jack cheese with mozzarella, cheddar and Colby cheeses. Oh and I served it on white rice! That's all I had but it came out yummy! Definitely a recipe you can play with so I plan to make this again!

I made this casserole last night for dinner. I followed the recipe but I added 6 cups of cooked egg noodles and a little milk to thin out the sauce. It smelled fantastic while it was in the oven. My husband and I loved it. We both had seconds. It made a large casserole so I have leftovers for tonight. I will absolutely be making this again. 5 Stars

I tried this recipe because of reviewer Petrofi , who reviewed the actual recipe instead of their own recipe , add ins, and tweaking.... This was great over a baked potato...Just awesome.
I assume it would be good over noodles and potatoes as well

Great low carb casserole!  I'm always looking for good recipes that don't have potatoes or rice, so this fit the bill.  I used fresh broccoli and steamed it a little before baking.  Also added garlic and some italian spices.  Halved the ingredients as I'm cooking for 3 people.  Everyone really liked it!

I halved the recipe and added some macaroni noodles and substituted cream of mushroom soup for cream of celery and added celery seed. I also did mozzarella and cheddar cheeses instead of Monterey Jack (because that's what I had on hand), then I mixed it all in my 16" skillet and cooked it on the stove top. It was a hit!

I used a small onion, mincing it then stir fry until they started to sweat then added ground turkey, a packet from Costco, so that's a lb+. Once that was browned up I mixed it with a can of cream of chicken soup and one cream of celery soup along with half a cup of sour cream, then put it in a med size glass casserole dish. I used two med size fresh broccoli heads, and stir fried them up for a few min until bright green. I added the broccoli on top of the meat mixture and put 2 cups of cheese on top. I used a bag of colby/ montery jack mixture. All in the oven at 350 for an hr, it is delicious!! 4 stars for great base, but I'd certainly reccomend tweaking it.

I used fresh broccoli, but other than that I followed the recipe. It was quick, easy and tasty. Slightly bland, next time I'll season a bit more. Pepperjack cheese might be good.

Very good. Halved the beef, mushrooms and onions. Added minced garlic, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper, and oregano to browning meat. Added 1 can of cream of celery soup and 1 cup of greek yogurt instead of sour cream to meat. Sliced 4 small red potatoes (skin on). Seasoned with salt and pepper and heated in microwave for 5 minutes. Mixed broccoli, potatoes and meat mix into baking dish. Light coating of mexican blend cheese on top. Cooked for 50 minutes at 350.

This was amazing! I used cream of mushroom instead of celery. I used fresh broccolli uncooked. I added egg noodles, broccoli topped with monterey jack cheese then added the meat mixture on top. Cooked it about 30 minutes. Then topped with monterey and cheddar cheese on top and put it back in the oven until melted. I did half the recipe but I wish I made more. It was gone in about 20 minutes between me, my mom, and 4 and 7 yr old girls. My picky 4 yr old who says she doesn't like cheese ate 2 plates and she asked me to cook it again the next day. If I had some ground beef I would make it again today. Yum yum yum

This is a great and very different dish! Delish! I changed it up quite a bit though to stretch it. Used a 23 oz can of cream of mushroom, 10 oz can cream of celery and 10 ounce can cream of cheese. Added bacon bits and jalapeños to it. Boiled some egg noodles. Mixed it all together and topped with cheese. Will definitely be making this again.  Hamburger Helper ain't got nothing on this!

This was a great dish. I did make the following changes....I substituted heavy cream for cream of celery soup and I used 24 ounces broccoli and 20 ounces of ground beef and omitted the mushrooms.  I think the celery soup would have been very yummy but I did not have this on hand.  I also used about 5 ounces of mild white cheddar as a topping versus Colby jack (again what I had on hand).  This is the perfect recipe for someone eating a low carb diet and since it was so rich it was quite filling. I think my smaller casserole would have easily fed 6 people ( we only are 1/3 of the dish for 2 adults and a child).  I think others suggested rice or potatoes added which I think would be delicious also!

Hmmm… I used fresh broccoli and the broccoli tasted burned after an hour in the over at 350? I halted the recipe but it seems like something was not right...

Love this recipe, but used many of these suggestions. used cream of mushroom soup, and half of the suggested amount, also half of the sour cream, along with plenty of Worcestershire sauce and seasoning for the meat. Also added some sliced baby butter potatoes. Would probably try the butter noodles also next time. But my husband and baby loved it!

I made this for me and my guy and just like the other reviewer said, he doesn't like broccoli or care about mushrooms but he loved it! He even commented on the broccoli that it actually tasted good! I know it was because of the cheese but I don't care! Only thing different I did was add mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese.

I made this recipe exactly by the directions.  It was quite good, extremely filling, and we had lots left over.  I will definitely make this recipe again, though I think I will try cream of mushroom soup instead.

Kind of bland, but a good starting point to be customized.  I used fresh broccoli chopped small and microwaved for two minutes first and it came out fine.

This dish was a great starting point for me, considering I have almost all the ingredients. I had red potatoes boiling when I found this recipe, then I noticed that I had 1/2 a container of ranch dip and 1/2 of sour cream, I mixed those together than added them to the hamburger. I ended up mashing the potatoes and mixing them with the brocoli add adding other spices and butter of course. I used mozzerella and colby (the only ones I had). Thanks for the great idea.

So delicious!!!!!  One of our favorite dishes.  I added noodles and potatoes for more substance and it was great.  Next time, I will only use noodles.  I also substituted cream of broccoli and cream of mushroom for the cream of celery.

This recipe as written is definitely lacking and only 2 stars to me.  I used cream mushroom soup since in house.  I also layered over noodles tossed with parmesan, garlic powder and butter, then added the cheese to top layer.  This was all in an attempt to salvage this very bland recipe.  My end result was kind of like hamburger helper.  It was better the next day as a leftover after the flavors blended, but not a redo.

I made mashed potatoes on the side to go with it.  The next time I'll put it all together and bake it like a sheperd's pie.  I used cream of mushroom as that's all I had.  It was delicious and you could substitute other veggies instead of the broccoli.  Give it a try.

Loved this casserole. Quick and easy on a busy day. My 4 kids ate it all up, and hubby liked it too. I also tweaked it to our tastes -- left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand and used seasoning salt instead of regular. Also substituted cr. of mushroom soup for the celery. Jalapeno havarti cheese on top instead of Monterey Jack. Served with rice. I'd like to try it with potatoes cooked in, as suggested in other reviews. Definitely a recipe I'll use again. It's even a great one for starter cooks, like my 9 year old!

This didn't work for us. I really wanted to like it, but the broccoli was mushy and the sauce felt like it was missing something. It kind of reminded me of beef stroganoff with broccoli and cheese.

I tried this recipe for dinner last night.  My whole family loved it!  It has wonderful flavor and wonderful texture.  I also think it will prove to be really versatile.  It stands alone as a casserole ad while we were eating, we came up with a bunch of ideas that we could use it for as well.
Thanks for posting it!

Like just about everyone else, I made this recipe my own, I added the 2 cubed potatoes, which I sautee'd for a few minutes first.  I mixed in a handful of jack and a handful of cheddar cheeses and then put some more on top.  I seasoned the meat really well and added the slice mushrooms and chopped onion when I cooked it.  I baked covered at 400 degrees for 30 minutes then uncovered for another 15, I let stand 15 minutes and it was great!
My boys and I love casseroles, my husband, not so much!  But he thought it was alright and will be willing to eat it again!  YUMMY!

quite tastey.  I would reccommend that you let the casserole set for about 10 minutes before serving up.  Let the soup and sourcream set a little.

I first looked up this recipe to see what I could make with the ingrediants I had. The changes I made were 1 can of mushroom soup with the 16oz sour cream. I used fresh broccoli. Steamed the broccoli in the microwave for about 4 mins. Then I layered it with chedder cheese and tore up some bread and mixed in melted butter and put on top of cheese. The next time I made it just as it said and it was delicious. Thanks so much.

5 star versatility!  I did changes like a lot of others.  About half the meat, half the sour cream, didn't have cr. soup, so I added flour and beef base to thicken.  Also, I added garlic to the meat and cooked the fresh broccoli then mixed it in with the meat.  Then only 8 oz cheese and baked for 45 min.  I put it over egg noodles.  So easy and very tasty.  Some recipes are great for versability!  This one is for certain!  You can use what you have and still comes out tasty!

Good, but I would use a sharp cheddar cheese next time.  I would probably make this again.  Although my kids didn't seem to care for it.

I pleasantly surprised my husband with this wonderfully tasting dish that is so easy to make! I cut the recipe in half and wish I didn't, because the leftovers were gone very quickly. The only thing that would make this better is to use fresh or steamfresh broccoli instead of frozen. I made this recipe with small parsley potatoes on the side.

As much as I wanted to like this casserole...I didn't. Maybe with a different soup such as cream of mushroom I would like it better. The sour cream taste was just too strong for me and the texture wasn't very appealing. Kids didn't care for it either.
