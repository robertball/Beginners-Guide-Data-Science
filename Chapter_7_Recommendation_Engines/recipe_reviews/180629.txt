Very good dip!! I made a few modifications though. I cooked the spinach and red pepper along with about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in 3 tablespoons of butter instead of boiling them in water. I cooked them until the spinach and red pepper were tender, then I added the cream cheese, milk, about 1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. I followed the rest of the recipe as it is written, then I transferred the mix to a small crockpot turned on low to keep it warm. Then, I thinly sliced a loaf of Italian bread, lightly buttered each side, and sprinkled mozzerella and parmesan cheeses on it. I baked the bread on a cookie sheet for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees and served the bread with this dip. It made a great appetizer for our party, everyone loved it!!!

I made this dip for a cooking party at the house and was very pleased!  First - we used frozen spinach and it turned out just fine.  Second - We added one clove of fresh garlic (finely chopped). Third - We used roasted red peppers instead of fresh.  It added much more flavor to the dip.  Fourth - we added some Italian blend cheese into the mixture to make it extra cheesy and to thicken it a bit; we then put a generous sprinkle on top to melt in the oven.   For the bread bowl we picked up a round on the discount bakery rack and stuck it in the freezer ahead of time.  It didn't matter that it was hard since we were just hollowing it out for the dip. The dip was a big hit!!!

OMG! This dip is fantastic! I sliced one red pepper and 3 gloves of garlic very thin and roasted in the oven with maybe a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Mixed in the spinach/pepper with the diced roasted peppers and garlic. Used Parmesan/Romano blend cheese and doubled the cheese. SO GOOD!

I loved this recipe and so did my party guests!  I served as a cold dip so that I could make the night before.  I used diced roasted red peper from a jar.  I added garlic powder and some finely sliced green onion.  After heating I let cool for 10 min then added approximately 1/2 cup of sour cream (depending how loose you want it).  I chilled overnight and it was awesome.  Thanks!

So yummy!!  I will definitely be making this again.  It was incredibly easy to make, only required one pan to be dirtied and it tastes divine!  I accompanied the dip with carrots and green peppers (I wanted to use red peppers but I ran out).   The sweet flavor of the carrots fit the dip perfectly.  I didn't care for the green peppers as much.  Next time I will definitely use red peppers, carrots, and bread.  And believe me, there WILL be a next time!!

Great quick and easy spinach dip, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen because that's what I had, it turned out great. I also thought it wouldn't be spicy enough so I added about another tablespoon of crushed chili peppers, it was pretty spicy(great for me) but 2 tablespoons was probably enough for most tastes. Also if you are putting it in a bread bowl use a dish inside the bread for easy re-heating(although there might not be any left!)

I'm always looking for dips for raw vegetables and rice crackers.  I'm gluten-intolerant and a small amount of dip and a few rice crackers stand in for sandwiches on my lunch menus.  This dip could also be made with thick sour cream instead of cream cheese.  Add the sour cream to achieve the consistency you like.

Excellent!  I made this at Christmas time and have made it for football Sundays.  I did not use the crushed red pepper.  Also, the first time I made it I put it in a bread bowl, which was good, but noticed within a few minutes that the dip cools and it's harder to scoop.  Since then, I've been making it and putting it in the crock pot 'little dipper' to keep it warm and serve it with carrots and crackers - wonderful!

This is a fantastic recipe! I love spinach dip and have been making almost the exact recipe for years! The only difference in the recipe I use is to saute the red pepper and spinach in butter instead of boiling. I can't wait to try it this way and plan to do so soon ;)

Love this dip!  I served it in a bowl, with veggies and corn chips.  Bread was also available.  Followed the recipe exactly, but I don't think the spinach & red pepper needs to be real exact.    There was just a little left and I could not throw it away.  Refrigerated and enjoyed the next day, reheated.  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Flavor was very good, but once dip cooled, it was difficult to spread.  Would use a mini crock pot to keep warm if I make it again.

Excellent Dip!  I like it a bit more spicy and add fresh garlic and lots more red pepper.  I have also found that my husband and I prefer more spinach than the recipe calls for.  Usually about 1-1.5.

This dip is so mediocre!  I needed to bring a hot dip to a party that already had artichoke and  dips so I found this one and read all the great reviews.  I made to and was so disappointed when I tasted it.  Added tons more parmesan and red pepper flakes, garlic salt and it still tasted mediocre.

Execellent dip, but used a 12oz can of artichoke hearts instead of spinach. Did not boil artichokes with peppers, but added with other ingriedients. Absolutely delicious!!!!! Also added 1 tbs of garlic.

AMAZING!!  I made this for New Year's Eve, (replacing my standby Spinach and Artichoke Dip), and it was a HUGE hit!!  Doubled the recipe and put the dip into a glass bowl that I then put into a bread bowl, for easier reheating.  Needless to say, I never reheated this dip!  It went quick, but even at room temp it was still delicious!  Next time I'll put it right into the bread bowl.  Only addition was two cloves of minced garlic that I added in while cooking the spinach and pepper, simply because we love garlic, and it worked wonderfully in this recipe!!  Will make this again and again!  Thank you for sharing!!

My dip turned out so cute, I felt compelled to post a photo of it! I used pimentos instead of fresh bell pepper and used the extra and some green onions to make a festive sprig of "holly" as a garnish. Also, I added parmesan and sharp white cheddar cheeses to make the dip a little less "cream cheesy".

This dip was awesome!!! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it, even my 3 year old. I doubled the crushed red pepper flakes, just because we like spicy food. We served it on warm, sliced french bread which was perfect for spooning out a generous amount. This was far better than any spinach dip I have ever had and easy to make too!

Loved it! Used fresh spinach (1 bag) and cooked with the red peppers and a little garlic then mixed in the cream cheese, milk and parm. The pepper flakes add a great level of flavor and just a little heat. Delicious on toasted bread!

One of the best dips I have tried. I also added red  roasted peppers from the jar, really for color, but it did enhance the flavor. I used whole wheat crackers, but next time I'm going to serve it with garlic bread sticks. Thanks Roosterlady for a great recipe

I like the recipe, but it is quite bland.  I followed another reviewers advice by adding a half cup of sour cream and a half cup of mozzarella, but I also added a minced chili pepper to the mix.  It could also use at least another quarter cup of bell pepper.  As is the cream cheese completely overwhelms the rest of the dish.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I make it for every gathering.  However, I use one roasted red pepper, chopped instead of cooking them myselves.  Sometimes, I use asiago cheese or feta instead of the Parmesan.  I also like spicy food; so, I sometimes add a touch more crushed red pepper or a dash of hot sauce.  Sooo delicious!

Cooked spinach and peppers with some garlic in a little olive oil, then added cream cheese and extra milk before adding parmesan (used extra pamesan too) This was absolutely delicious and easy.

This receipt was excellent!  Made it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it and I've been requested to make it at our family reunion for Christmas.  Can be eaten w/ crackers, bread or veggies.  Next time I may add garlic to it!  Tastes very much like a restaurant dip!

I love this colorful dip.  I had a bag of fresh spinach that I had to use as  its expiration date was today. I chopped it up, threw it in boiling water.  I roasted 1 large red pepper (came out to 1 cup) in the toaster oven while spinach was boiling, drained spinach, then added freshly shredded parmesan and romano cheese to my lowfat cream cheese. I'm definitely taking this to my next party.

THIS WAS SOOO GOOD, BUT I DIDN'T REALLY FOLLOW THE RECIPE. I THOUGHT IT NEEDED MORE SPINACH. I MADE A DOUBLE BATCH AND DID THE WHOLE BAG OF SPINACH, ONE WHOLE BELL PEPPER AND 2 PACKAGES OF CREAM CHEESE. I FOLLOWED A REVIEWERS COMMENT AND COOKED THE SPINACH AND BELL PEPPER IN BUTTER AND OLIVE OIL. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!

I used fresh spinach because that is what I had.  I used about half a bag, which cooked down to about a half cup like the recipe calls for, however, I really love spinach, and I think when I make it next time I will use the whole bag.  I also used a very large red bell pepper and roasted it in the oven while the spinach cooked.  It came out perfect, but it was a lot of red pepper, so I would recommend using a medium sized red pepper.  I added a little garlic powder while the spinach was cooking, and I used a bit more red pepper flakes than called for.  This was so good, I will for sure make it again and again.

I only made two essential changes to the recipe, and one change to the technique.  
Change to Recipe:
1. Added freshly minced garlic to the simmering spinach-red pepper mix
2. Used roasted red peppers rather than fresh ones-- a lot more flavorful than regular non-roasted peppers
These two changes made my spinach-pepper dip much more deeper and flavorful

Change to Technique:
*  I actually blended my spinach-red pepper mix after I had drained all the water out of them.  
My final result was a beautiful color and even blend of delicious red coloured dip spotted with the green of the spinach.  

I served the dip in a cup that I placed within a hollowed wheat bread bowl.  With the pieces I garnered from the wheat bread bowl, I first lightly sprayed them with olive oil, sprinkled some italian seasoning on them, and toasted them in the oven for three minutes. I also "roasted" the bread bowl for further firmness.  My guests also used Italian crostini, sesame breadsticks, spicy Dorito chips, tortilla chips, and flaky German bread stix and dipping pieces.  I had very little to none leftovers the next day!

Easy, inexpensive and delicious! I recently made it three times (it's that good) in the same week for various holiday events. A big hit with the guests. I used a little less parm cheese and it tasted great. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. I served with tortilla chips and crusty bread pieces.

Excellent recipe. The spicy crushed red pepper really makes it. I'm sure you could modify the rest of the recipe a bit and it would still be great, but don't get rid of that crushed red unless you hate spicy food!

Divine! Note: Cook right before serving. As reheating this on the stove, even a little bit, does not work well.  I made mine an hour ahead of time, and it was too early.  Fantastic dish either way- i served with both toasted bread and garlic butter crackers!

This stuff is AMAZING!  I've made it twice in one week!  It's super easy, fast, and tastes great.  I use a bit more red pepper flakes... a little over a teaspoon probably.  Also, if you're making it for a party you might want to double the recipe- it went really fast!  Tastes great on pita chips too!

It's awesome. One thing I do is saute some fresh garlic and throw it in the mix - delicious either way.

Fantastic! I made this for my sons High School graduation party and it was a hit! I did run short on time so I threw everything into my crockpot in the morning on low, and stirred occasionally throughout the afternoon. Only changes I made was to up the Parmesan a bit and add an Italian shredded cheese blend to make it thicker and cheesier. I served this with crostini that I had made the night before from day old French bread and some pita chips. Absolutely amazing!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this turned out very bland and no one ate it after trying it at a New Year's Eve party.

Added two cloves of garlic and some artichoke hearts and this was delicious! I've always looked for a warm dip that doesnt require the oven... This is it, and super fast and easy!

I found this dip to be rather bland, I added some seasoned salt and sauteed garlic with yellow onion as others suggested but it was still fairly bland.

Made this dish on Thanksgiving and my family loved it.  One of my daughter's fav is Spinach Artichoke Dip and I think this may be her new favorite!  Loved this dish.  We used orange & yellow bell peppers because the store we went to didn't have Red Bell Pepper.  Added chopped red onions and garlic and pan seared the veggies instead of boiling.  Turned out great!

Made it for a party, and received rave reviews.  Like other reviewers, I used roasted red peppers instead of fresh.  I also added sundried tomatoes to give the dip a little bit of a bite.   This is such a good alternative to plain spinach and artichoke dip.

The dip did taste good but I could hardly taste the spinach and red pepper. Maybe I will use more of them next time.

Turned out better than expected. I used a mix of red and orange sweet pepper and also substituted collard greens instead of spinach and it worked very well. Its difficult to tell the difference between spinach and collards after boiling. And yes, I used homemade ricotta too....I know I made so many changes, yet the idea was of the dip and it tasted well on toasted seed bread.

Extremely simple, cost effective, and tasty! Looks pretty in a bread bowl but I'd rather just bake it and use bread to dip into it...

I made this for a small get together and everybody who ate it loved it! My dip was the only thing that was completely devoured. I basically followed the recipe, only made a couple changes but got great results and will make again.

I made this recipe for the holidays (yesterday) and I have a request to make it again today!  I modified the recipe slightly based on a previous review. I cooked the spinach, garlic and red pepper in butter; until cooked. I made a small modification here by adding 1/4 c parmesan AND 1/4 mozzarella to the milk and sour cream mixture. I also cut up 1/2-1" slices of a french baguette and topped it with parmesan and mozz. This dip did not last long and people went back for 4 or more servings!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Wonderful. I needed to use up spinach since I bought way too much this week and chose this recipe, I am glad I did! The only changes I made was to use fresh ground chilies to kick it up a notch instead of the flakes, and I used white pepper instead of black pepper because sometimes I prefer it. It ended up being fairly spicy (not too much the kids could still eat it).  It was perfect when we paired it with sweet Hawaiian bread!  I think it would make a festive holiday dish.

Excellent recipe! I always underestimate red pepper flakes, so unless you really like it hot, don't use extra. Also, I'd recommend cooking over low heat to avoid scorching the milk/cheese.

This was great! I'm not much of a red pepper lover. In fact, I almost left it out! So glad I didn't. The red pepper made the dip. I did use bread, but it's also good with tortilla chips. Try it, you'll love it!
