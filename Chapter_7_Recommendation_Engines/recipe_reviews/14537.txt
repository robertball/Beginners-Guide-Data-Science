This was amazing. Instead of using it as a rub, I put the spices and chicken into a gallon sized zip-lock bag with olive oil as a marinade. If you like it spicy, this is the recipe to use.

Used this recipe as the base for a chicken taco salad at a neighborhood Cinco de Mayo party.  Quite good.  Followed the recipe exactly but used smoked hungarian paprika as that's all I had on hand.  Noted the thyme was overpowering - hence only 4 stars....  Using 1 tsbp of cayenne pepper would have been too much for "just chicken", but by utilizing it in a salad, the greens cut the spiciness.  Perfect recipe to replace beef in a taco salad for those of us who are watching cholesterol!!!  Thanks Barbara for a great recipe!

Wowza! I was sneezing throughout the entire mixing process. Take heed: this recipe makes a lot. Rub was good, but I feel the thyme overpowered the blend. (I’m not a big fan of the herb.) Next time I will decrease to ½ Tbs. and keep the rest of the ingredients the same.  I love the fiery/hot taste mix gave my poultry. It was even good in my salad the next day.

I just made Spicy Chicken Breasts for dinner, and my husband and I loved them!!  They were absolutely delicious!  However, I took the advice from a few others, and used half the amount of cayenne pepper because I didn't want them to be too spicy.  I also used bone-in chicken breasts and baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes.  They came out perfectly...the center was tender and moist, and the seasoning on the outside was just right!!  Thanks Barbara, this is definitely a 5-Star recipe, and we'll for sure be using the left over rub...I can't wait!

WOWEE!! This is some SPICY chicken! The flavor was excellent (almost like blackened chicken), but since I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to hot foods I think I'll cut the cayenne pepper in half next time.  Either that, or not use quite as much spice rub on the chicken breasts before I grill them (I really rubbed it on thick)! If you like hot and spicy foods though, you'll really love this... just make sure you have plenty of cold beer on hand to put out the fire! :)

I used all the ingredients, except the salt – there is enough sodium in the recipe already.  I did not use a grill, as it was about 12 degrees outside and I didn’t feel like bundling up!  I put some extra virgin olive oil in a pan, flash fried the chicken on High for 2 minutes on each side, while covered. Then I turned the heat down to medium-low and cooked both sides, checking the centers every couple minutes.  I had a light Cesar Salad mix and some garlic bread to go with the chicken.  Was a fantastic dinner, my husband loved it (he likes spicy food) and while I was worried it would be too spicy for me, the bread and salad really helped ‘cool’ it down and I had no trouble eating it.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Using 1 TBSP "GROUND" cayenne was too spicy for my family. Tried only 1 tsp. and it was just a little "hot", but more to our taste.  Good... but we liked the "Jenny's Grilled Chicken Breasts" from this site) better. Both recipes are exceptional with salad greens and your favorite dressing.

Sorry... I did not like this recipe at all.  My husband, (who would rave about toast) said it was "ok".  The seasoning was just not good, and brought no yummy flavor to the chicken.  I even went with others recommendations and cut the cayenne in half.  This is the first recipe from this site I have not given 5 stars to!

We're new to the dry rub scene... and boy, have we been missing out.  This was fabulous!  Just the right amount of heat (I only used 1/2T of the cayenne pepper, though).  If you're looking for a way to spice up plain old chicken breasts, give this one a try!

Really good recipe.  It came out so spicy! I did it a bit differently - I mixed all the spices in yogurt and marinated the chicken in that, and then I baked it in the oven with the marinade (350 degrees, for 45 minutes).  The chicken was really tender, and the marinade created sauce, which would have been nice to have with rice.  I also used chopped onion and minced garlic rather than powder.  I will definitely make this again!

Awesome rub!  We started using it on chicken for a little kick up a notch.  Now we use it on steak, pork chops, and vegis.  Even my oldest child likes it!

This was really good! I live in an apartment, so I don't have a grill. Instead I followed the directions (exchanged cayenne with chili powder because that's what I had...), and then seared the chicken with a little bit of olive oil in a pan for 1 minute per side. Popped it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Perfect! So moist and tasty

I love spicy food, so I thought this was great,  however it was way too spicy for my husband.  I would definitely make it again for myself.

Excellent recipe, we had to double the cayenne because we were low on paprika, but it was perfect for my sister and I who adore spicy food. Mom found it a bit too strong, but lessened the spice with some ranch which also tasted great. Will definitely make this again

This was very delicious! Only change I made was putting double the cayenne pepper (don't do this if you don't like really spicy food) and cutting the thyme in half since it is a very overpowering herb.  Is good on the grill but I have baked this in the oven on 350 for 40 minutes and it is very moist and tender.

Too spicy! This chicken was really good. It would have been excellent if it weren't so spicy. I love spicy food, but this was too much. Next time I make this I'm going to try it with 1 tsp. instead of 1 tbsp.

This was an excellent rub.  I've made it twice already and the entire family loves it.  I did reduce the cayenne pepper to half what the recipe called for since I personally don't like things too hot.  Hubby does like hot stuff though, so I may try it again exactly as the recipe calls for.

Wow wow wow!!!! This chicken was delicious and flavorful. We didn't have the time to cook on a grill, so instead we cooked in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes or so. It was just delicious with green beans and mashed potatoes.

This is a great recipe to work with! As other readers mentioned, I left out the Thyme and the Salt as 1 tablespoon of salt is far too much sodium! use onion salt instead of onion powder and it satisfies the sodium cravers out there. Great flavour on chicken but we also used it on Butterfly Pork Chops with fantastic results! Hubby and I love heat so the more the merrier! Thanks Barb for creating and sharing a great rub recipe!

Quick, easy and delicious. I followed other reviewers' advice and cut back on the cayenne, salt and thyme. I put everything in a Ziploc bag along with a tablespoon of olive oil, made sure all the chicken pieces were coated (I used chicken leg quarters) and baked, covered, immediately at 350 for about 45 minutes. I uncovered the chicken and baked for an additional 15 minutes. Tender, flavorful, great. Thank you. We will make this often.

I used a little olive oil and then smothered the full amount of rub on 4 chicken breasts. I baked in the oven for 50 minutes at 400 degrees. Served with sweet corn and a garden salad. The spice was perfect.

We really liked this blend. Spicy as the title states, and the thyme in there gives a really nice flavor to all that spice. This would be a really nice seasoning mix for blackening the chicken, too. Thanks for sharing, this will be a definite repeat recipe :)

I cut down on the cayenne quite a bit and it was still pretty spicy.  Next time I will probably use maybe a quarter of a tablespoon (but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy!).  Other than that, good flavor and kept the chicken nice and moist!

Outstanding!  I mixed the rub according to the recipe and it is HOT!  This would be so good with a cold beer!  I used the suggestion from another reviewer, and marinated the pounded breasts in the rub mixed with a combination of olive and canola oil.  My rub/oil marinade was very, very thick and the resulting grilled breasts had a thick, blackened crust on them.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  Next time I will use all canola, no olive, oil so there is no taste from the oil at all.

I agree with the other reviews that rated this recipe low.  There is not enough flavor at ALL.  It just tastes like cayenne pepper.  Something is definitely missing.  I am disappointed that I used quite a bit of spices on this recipe.  So save your spices and use them on  another recipe with more flavor.

This was very good. I put the spices in butter and melted it. And then I cooked on a George Foreman grill...not the same as real grill, but my husband loved it. It goes well with cream corn like no other.

Super spicy but my fiance and I both like spicy food.  I made the spice mix and then put 2 chicken breasts, 1.5 tablespoons of the mix, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a big Ziploc bag.  I smushed everything around so that it was evenly coated and then tossed it in the fridge for a couple of hours.  I cooked ours on the stovetop for a few minutes on medium high (each side) and then with the lid on at medium/medium low until done.  They were great!  I also pounded out the breasts a little while they were still in the bag.  I can't wait to toss a little of the spice mix (instead of just salt & pepper) into the normal lemon juice/olive oil marinade that I use for baked salmon.

I used boneless pork chops instead of chicken and cut the cayenne in half, but before adding the cayenne, I rubbed one chop with the mixture for my one-year old. I sampled the non-spicy version after grilling and thought the flavor was excellent and my one year old agrees. Our spicy-version turned out to be fantastic, with just enough heat for our tastes. I wouldn't put the full amount of cayenne in. We can handle super-spicy, but it is more enjoyable and flavorful with less IMHO.

Even with half of the salt and half the cayenne, the chicken was salty and the flavours just didn't go well together. I got a thumbs down from the family and ended up throwing out the rest of the rub.

Very nice, simple and clean taste. A few things need adjustment, though; Omit the salt - trust me. Also, this is quite spicy (which I love), so for those who aren't big fans of burning mouths, cut the cayenne in half, or 1/3 if you are really scared. Several other reviewers did not like the thyme, but I think that is what really cleans up the flavor and makes it stand out from plain spicy to a tasty spicy. Great on shrimp, too!

This rub recipe is Emeril's Essence (less the oregano in his).  I like the hint of oregano.  Makes great chicken or pork.

Mixed the seasoning blend for 8 servings.  Put 7 chicken breasts in a zip loc bag with flavored olive oil and 3 T of seasoning.  Did that with 3 bags of 7 and still had plenty of seasoning left over. Used 1/4 C of paprika and garlic...2T of salt...onion powder and black pepper..1T thyme...1/2 T cayenne.  Marinated over night.  Made 8/28/11..next time do 4T of seasoning per bag...great but could have used more seasoning taste.

AWESOME chicken! I love very hot food and found that 1/2 of the cayene pepper was plenty. As a rub, not all seasoning made is actually used.
Definately a keeper!

Super yummy!!  Scaled this down as we were only cooking 2 chicken breasts and based on other reviews, I did cut the cayenne down a bit.  Used smoked spanish paprika instead of regular and LOVED it.  Really nice flavour, a bit spicy, but nothing crazy.  Will repeat this one :)

Recipe was great and very spicy!  I added fresh garlic and reduced the thyme.  I also recommend using the recipe with 6 chicken breasts...it makes a lot of rub for only 4.

I didn't think this was spicy at all but my husband thought it was a good amount of heat.  I have a love for really spicy things though.  It was okay but nothing fantastic.  However, it was easy to make since I had everything on hand.

As suggested by others, I cut the thyme and cayenne in half, but I also halved the salt and substituted 1/2 tsp. of Cavender's. I was out of onion powder, so I used minced onion instead (not sure this was effective). The rub kept the chicken SO juicy! I was really pleased. I sliced a lime to squeeze on top, and perfection!

this chicken was moist and flavorful. i cut the amounts of thyme and red pepper in half because of personal preference. I used half the recipe to cover 3 bone-in chicken breasts which i baked in the oven at 375 degrees for about an hour. I tried to cook rice with it, but for some reason the rice didn't cook, but the chicken was delicious! My boyfriend and i loved it.

This seasoning is good to have on hand for those nights when I need a good dinner without much effort.  I like to top the breasts with a little bit of butter, cover, and bake 30 min. at 350*, then uncover and bake an additional 15 min.

This is excellent on chicken and pork.I noticed some reviewers had family members that didn't like theirs so hot.Mix up spice without cayenne and divide into 2 shakers,then add cayenne to each ( 1 1/2 teas. to one and less to other)Shake on at grill.

WHOA!  I am a spice fanatic, and found these had a great bite to them!!  I used it on cubed chicken this afternoon and made a nice spicy chicken pasta dish.  I think it might be a tad too spicy for some kids, but a definate must try for people who like their food to have a little kick to it!

This had a good flavor and made plenty of extra spice rub for other dishes. It was a bit hot for me but my husband loved it. I will definitely be making it again for him. I substituted lemon pepper for salt.

YUM!  I love the combination of spices.  I made a quadruple batch and instead of mixing it in a bowl, just put it all in a ziploc baggie for easy storage.  Its going to be great on salmon.  My husband enjoyed the leftover's on a sandwich.  Too spicy for one kid, but the other enjoyed it.  Definately a keeper!

This is awesome!  It is so easy, put it together, rub it on and cook it!  I love spicy foods, and this is an easy treat.  I don't have kids, so, I can't rate that category.  I love that there is enough to use again later.

Loved it! I followed the recipe omitting the salt which I typically omit salt from recipes when possible, this recipe doesn't need it. Also, I omitted the onion powder only because I didn't have any on hand. However, I just eyeballed it without measuring the spices (also added parsley flakes) and mixed them with enough olive oil to baste all over the frozen chicken.. I used it on my Costco Frozen Chicken Breasts and cooked my three pieces which was all I needed for tonight's dinner. I cooked the boneless, skinless chicken breasts straight from frozen at 400 F for 45 minutes on convection bake. They came out perfect, not dry, so tasty and juicy. Had the chicken with Italian Frozen veggies, kept it simple tonight! For desert, I made baked cup custard.

This was delicious and spicy!  I took another review's hint and added olive oil to the spices in a large zip bag and marinated the chicken in it for about an hour or so before I grilled it.  We're all still talking about it and can't wait to have it again this weekend.  I served them with a Rice-a-Roni herb & butter rice and Maple Dill Carrots from this site.  The carrots' sweetness countered the spicy chicken perfectly!  Thanks for this great recipe that is going to be made a lot in the future in this house!

FANTASTIC!!  This blend of spices reminds me of the Jamaican/African Piri Piri spice blends.  

I made a small batch of this recipe by using a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon for each ingredient. I didn't want to waste spices in case this wasn't a good mix.  It produced enough seasoning to cover 1-1/2 pounds of chicken breast strips.  I put the seasoning in a plastic bag and added the chicken strips, shook them in the spices until coated then put them on the hot grill.  

I grilled the chicken strips in the oven, using my cast iron grill, at a preheated 450-degrees for 15 minutes, turned the strips over at 7 minutes.   

Here goes my review and I must admit that I eliminated the black pepper as I feared it would make it too hot.  All other spices were used as directed.  It's lovely.  I imagine this would also be fantastic when sprinkled onto a salad, or sprinkled in a tortilla wrap.  Oh yes. We will have this rub on our chicken many more times.

I'm a spicy food fanatic, and I usually ramp up the spice in any recipe I try--but this is very good as it is! I make the chicken and then incorporate it into a cajun-style pasta dish, made with a fat-free sour cream sauce and flavored with the leftover rub and chicken broth. It's become a favorite of mine!

Excellent rub! I went a little easy on the cayenne and paprika, and it was still a good, spicy zing. I cooked this on a grill skillet, so instead of oiling a grate, I applied the rub to both sides, then dabbed oil onto one side of the chicken breasts. I put the oiled side down on the skillet, and after turning them, I applied a little bit of butter onto the cooked side to get a rich flavor. I can't wait to try it leftover! I imagine it will be great sliced into strips for a salad or sandwich.

Perfect.  Just reduce the cayenne or omit it for a kid-friendly rub.

I used cajun powder instead of cayenne pepper and skipped the thyme because I didn't have any.  If I make it again, I'll be sure to have the ingredients that the recipe calls for.  While gritty isn't the right word, it comes to mind simply because my spices didn't seem to absorb to well into the chicken.  Overall it was good, but not exactly what I was looking for.

No complaints on this simple chicken dish! I like finding "create-your-own" spice blends, since I don't buy many pre-made seasonings. This fit the bill and was especially great because it's basic spices I have on hand all the time. **Served over a salad.

This recipe was soooo good!  I didn't have thyme so I used Italian Seasoning (which has thyme in it) instead!  I put it in the oven since I didn't want to grill.  Add a little water to the pan and rubbed everything above including olive oil.  So good!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Had the spices on hand so instead of my usual Lysanders rub, I tried this - glad I did.  This will be my new favorite.  Spicy, but then it doesn't say mild chicken breasts.  Very good.

Made a batch of this for hubs to use often! Just the right amount of heat for us.  One thing I think I would enjoy is adding some rosemary too.  Love that on my grilled chicken.  Thank you Barbara!

This really is some spicy chicken! I used garlic salt in place of the garlic and salt. The chicken stayed moist on the grill and will please any spice-fiends taste buds! The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because the spice fiend in my house couldn't get enough of it but it was nearing too hot to handle for me.

This is delicious!  I added oilve oil and used it as a thick marinade.  My husband liked it so much that he currently has deer meat marinading in the fridge using this recipe.  I used only half the salt called for, and will use even less next time.

While good, this was not special.  I only mixed up half of the seasoning so I would not have to store it for another use. That seemed wasteful. I rubbed 4 chicken breasts over and under the skin then refrigerated overnight.  It was just baked chicken to us.

I  halved the cayenne after reading a few reviews but otherwise put the ingredients together as directed. I rubbed the chicken with just a bit of vegetable oil before seasoning liberally with the rub, covering and refrigerating overnight.   I grilled it up today on the George Foreman and had it on a sandwich with the Chipotle Mayo recipe from this site. YUMMY!

FANTASTIC.  Unlike many of the other "five star" rated recipes on this site, this is truly a five star.  Between the low calories, how quick and easy it is to prepare, and how tasty it is I will be making this again, again, and again!

This was great!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I grilled on my George Foreman and then sliced the chicken and topped it on a salad.  The chicken was so so so good!.  It was defintely HOT but I loved it.  It was perfect on top of a big salad.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful and I can't wait to make it again.

Wow, this is amazing on chicken!  The only thing that I would do different on this would be to bake it instead of cooking it on the stove-top.  Haven't had a chance to use it on the grill.  If you're baking it, bake at 350F covered by foil for 30 min and then for 15 min uncovered.  It's Amazing and spicy as can be!!!

This is a VERY Spicy Recipe!  My husband & I LOVED it & will definately use the spice mixture again!  If you don't like spicy hot - add a lot less cayenne pepper than the recipe calls for (ie. 1 tsp. to 1/2 Tbsp.)

I made this last night and it was really good! Very spicy! Our 5 and 2 year olds found it much too spicy but we liked the balance of flavors overall. Next time I would try cutting the cayenne pepper in half or maybe try red pepper flakes instead.

Very spicy but love it that way! Makes enough for 8 breasts. Don't cook at too high of heat or fumes will irritate sinuses not unlike blackening seasoning does.

I really like this recipe!!! Like others i cut on the cayenne pepper a bit, used as a marinade with some olive oil... I added half a lemon juice and half a minced garlic just because it was there and i needed to do something with it lol... it is a great recipe to spice up that boring chicken breast...

I didn't have chicken breasts on hand so I combined the spice mixture with a small amount of olive oil and used it as a wet rub for a whole chicken (inside and outside). Browned at 450 for 20 minutes, then turned the heat down to 400 for another 45 minutes. Very good and the drippings made a delicious gravy.

these were amazing! they were so full of flavor. I did reduce the ground cayenne a little bit because the rest of my family doesn't care for spicy too much but even with the reduction these were amazing! definitely one for the regular rotation!

The recipe, as described, is overpoweringly spicy.  You can't taste anything else, and I honestly think you could have just rubbed the chicken with straight cayenne and gotten the same results.  

I enjoy spicy food, but there's a difference between flavorful spice and just burn for the sake of burn.  This is the latter.

I made 1 spice change and it turned out to be the best chicken I've ever made!  I substituted chili powder (equal amount) for the cayenne and black pepper.  And because I didn't feel like grilling I put just a bit of vegetable oil in a skillet and cooked the breasts for 6 - 7 minutes each side over medium high heat.  This will become a monthly recipe for me.  So very happy I came across it.

What can I say? I like spicy and this fits perfectly; versital, great as a rub, added to soups, eggs prepared any way, use your imagination. You can easily adjust the cayenne.

If you can't handle heat don't follow the recipe like I did, cut down on the spice and you should be okay.

This was a very delicious rub for chicken.  Mine came out a bit salty (I'm sure it was my fault) but it grilled beautifully.  I made this chicken and topped it with the "Fresh Mango Salsa," another recipe found on this site.

Very good flavor.  My was VERY hot.  Almost couldn't eat it.  That was my fault, because I used a lot more than the reserved 3 tablespoons of seasoning mix.  Will use less next time.  Still very good!

My hubby and I made this tonight and loved it. I did heed other reviewers' advice and cut the cayenne in half and found it to be hot but not overpowering. I also used kosher salt instead of regular salt (and reduced the amount a bit as 1 tsp kosher = 1.25 tsp table salt) and reduced the thyme a bit. May add a bit of oregano to the mix as that is used in Mexican cooking and adds nice flavour (not that flavour was lacking, but I like oregano). Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great but I halved the amount of salt and cayenne pepper in the recipe. I first placed the chicken in brine for a couple hours before the rub went on and I grilled. I made a fresh papaya relish to go with it which complemented the spicy flavor of the meat (one papaya, one red bell pepper, one jalapeno and one red onion diced. Add 1/2 c. cilantro, 6 T lime juice, 1/4 c. pineapple juice. Use within 6 hours).

Nice combination of spices, but ultimately way too much for the quantity of chicken.  Either reduce the spices in half, or double the chicken.  I used this recipe as the base for blackened chicken sandwiches.

Very tasty if you like hot. Will do this recipe again however next time I will add some brown sugar to the rub mixture.  Also like the fact that the rub make enough to store and use again.  Would be great on pork as well.

Very delicious!  I used someone's suggestion to marinate using the spice mixture and olive oil.  I also cut way back on the cayenne so that my kids could enjoy it.  Definitely livens up a boring chicken breast!

Really good ... And I dont like anything. I add a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of sugar and some oregano. Cinnamon is key but only a little as it is really overpowering.

I really liked this recipe because it gave me a basic seasoning to use on grilled chicken breast tenders. I adjusted this recipe and used even amounts (1 TBS of each) of paprika, garlic powder, salt, onion powder, cayenne pepper and black pepper (no dried thyme). I also took others' advise and used the ziplock bag with a little oil to marinade chicken breast tenders. To top off the chicken tenders I heated up some BBQ sauce and poured it over the breasts with freshly chopped white onions, tomatoes and grated colby jack cheese on top. You could also add chopped green onions and cooked bacon pieces. Very tasty! I also made some brown rice with a frozen veggie medley mixed in the rice (very good)!

I give this 5 stars because it is a different way to enjoy chicken.  It certainly isn't my favorite chicken recipe, but rather a nice alternative.

I thought this recipe tasted great.  My husband is the one that said it was too spicy (I wonder, what was wrong with him).  I'd like to really thank you for sharing your recipe.

These were okay,I too was scared of a whole tablespoon of cayenne pepper so I used a 1/4,I could have used more for a little more kick. I liked the paprika tho and just made a simple green salad to put it on. Good recipe to keep the kitchen from getting hot.

This is easy to make and tasty. After reading some reviews, I did halve the cayenne - which worked well for my family. Also, to prepare the chicken I mixed 1 tbsp of the rub mixture with 1 tbsp of oil, and spread this over 4 deboned, skinless chicken breasts before grilling. It was just delicious. I'll use the rest of the mixture as a plain rub over pork or veggies.

This was definately a kick to the taste buds. Nice and spicy, but I felt that it was missing something.  I served it with barbeque sauce and it was a good combination.  Would probably make again.

I've made this meal two times and I love it. I think next time I will make it with the olive oil though. If you had a mouth for hot stuff this is it. I love this chicken and add extra cayenne to it. The family loved it and I will be making this for years to come :)

As other reviewers shared, I cut back on the thyme, and the thyme still tasted too strong for me! I'll probably cut it down to 1/4 TBS next time. Everything else I did exactly as written. I will be making this again and look forward to trying the rub on other meats.

I used this rub first on chicken breasts as the recipe suggested & loved the zing, so I have since used it on chicken burgers & calamari rings.  It can be put on anything that you would like to add a bit of heat to.

This is a super quick and easy way to add variety to chicken. I left out thyme because I didn't have it readily available. Cutting the salt is a MUST. A tablespoon of salt is a bit absurd in my opinion. Cut it to a teaspoon, you'll still have all the flavor.

Great flavor, not too spicy but it has nice heat:). I might add more pepper/cayenne pepper next time. 
Didn't add anything, and grilled on my foreman. LOVE the dry rub! mmmmm:) 6 stars!

I made this in under a half hour and loved it! An easy and quick main dish for last minute meals. Broiled for 8 minutes on one side, flipped over for another eight minutes, uncovered. I was afraid of it being too dry, but it was perfect. A lot of reviews said it was too spicy, but I personally didn't find it spicy enough. One friend found it hot, but tolerable and still very delicious. I'm not a big thyme person myself so I cut that in half. Served over white rice!

Though I didn't grill this, we loved the flavor.  I cooked it in a bit of EVOO and it turned out great! I did use a bit more of each seasoning at the end of cooking to give it a little extra flavor.

Lovely!  Instead of grilling I just put it in a oan with some heated olive oil. I served mine with half as much salt, and put granny smith apple slices in between chicken slices, a bed of rice really helped compliment this dish, tastes alot like blackened chicken (probably could be the same thing!), and I'm pretty sure the cayenne pepper is what cleared up my cold!  Have fun!  If I can make this dish, anyone can..believe me!

The spicy seasonig was delicious.  I used it on bake chicken legs.  I'm sure I'll use the seasoning again. 
This has become a regular spicy seasoning in my home thanks for the recipe.

Very good!!!! Cooked the chicken in the oven and and kept it covered with foil for the first half of baking. I cooked at 400 for 35 minutes. I think I will do up a batch of the rub and keep it on hand for BBQ season.

This was very good. My husband made this for us and exactly to recipe (he doesn't tweak recipes like I do). This was a nice change of pace. It isn't exactly what I would want on a steady basis, but it did live up to its' name. Hubby really liked it; he likes anything spicy! I would make again, but like once every three months or so. Hubby served with chicken rice a roni and green beans. Thanks for sharing.

We really liked this rub.The only thing I did different was for the ones I knew wouldn't like it that spicy I simply mixed some of the rub with bread crumbs. I dipped the chicken in an egg wash then the seasoned crumbs. For the rest I used it straight I also wasn't grilling so I "oven fried" it. Worked great. Can't wait for summer grilling season.

This was excellent!  Used about half the cayenne pepper, flattened the breasts to a uniform thickness, and brushed the breasts with about 1/4 teaspoon olive oil on each side before applying the rub.  Wrapped breasts in plastic wrap and refrigerated for about 30-45 minutes before grilling.

a wonderful blend of spicy spices, and yes it is spicy! i would recommend trying this for a pasta dish or to put on salad but just alone it lacks something. Would highly recommend trying this chicken to put in a dish, would be delicious.

This is a great recipe for those who are lovers of spice.  My husband even said that the rub added a "professional" flavor.  However, my kids found it entirely too hot for their taste.  The next time I make it, I'll be sure to cut the cheyenne pepper in half.

Spicy Chicken Breasts Haiku: "Eh, I like fire food. But, sneeze, gag, cough, this is HOT. Way too much cayenne." I made the full amount of seasoning, putting all of it in a jar for later, and then used 1 TB of it on my lonely chicken breast, grilled on George Foreman, and served over a salad for lunch. But now I'm wondering how to salvage the rest of the seasoning in the jar b/c it was EEEEYOWZA spicy. Ranch dressing in my salad cooled it down a bit, but I think the 1 TB cayenne was overkill.

I threw this together at the last minute, so had to make some changes out of necessity. Still, my family loved this recipe. I sliced the breasts into thirds and baked. I used the seasonings as written except omitting the tyme (my family is not a fan) and 3/4 tablespoon of garlic powder, because I ran out will still use the full amount next time and used onion salt because it was all I had on hand. We look forward to this again.

Great spice mixture. I cut the chicken into small peices then cooked with these spices. After the juice ran clear, i added 2 tbsp of lime juice, and cooked for 3 more minutes. Then i added a can of mushrooms and a half a can of cream of mushroom soup, and 1/3 a cup of white cooking wine. I transferred to a 9X9 baking dish and covered with shredded cheese and baked for 10 minutes, covered. This made a absolutely wonderful burrito filling. Paired with sour cream and the rest of the spice for people to add

Made this last night for dinner.  I broiled the chicken breasts in the oven as our BBQ is stored away for the winter. Hubby found it a tad too spicy for his taste but my daughter and I loved it.  The next time I make the spice mix I'll cut back on the cayenne a bit to please him.

This was very good.  I wanted something spicy but a little different from what I normally do when I want spicy.  We loved it.  Served the grilled chicken with AB's baked mac and cheese for a calming effect (well that and I love mac and cheese)

Yum! I made this spice combo as a rub for chicken wings but used less salt. It had a nice Spicy kick! BF said they were the best wings I ever made.  To bake - (1) rub wings in oil, (2) put wings & spice in ziploc (3) shake to coat (4) Baked at 350 - 30 mins skin side up, 20 mins skin side down, 10 mins skin side up = perfection!

Just tried this for the first time tonight. Made the rub exactly as is. Coated the chicken with it and cooked it on our Pampered Chef grill pan that I sprayed lightly with olive oil. It was perfect-juicy and tender! The flavor is similar to the Cajun wing flavor at WingStop. Spicy and delicious!

I quartered the recipe, added some olive oil and marinated. I cooked the chicken breasts for 30 mins at 350 and cut them up to use on taco salad. They were juicy and moist with a bit of zing! Adding to my recipe box!

Very good spice combination I didn't think it was over powering at all perhaps some reviews used the whole recipe for just 4 chicken breasts.... I think you should use the amount of spice to suite your own tastes if you like it spice really rub the chicken down if you prefer it mild then hold back... I really enjoyed this recipe thanks
UPDATE: I tried this spice on a pork chop but found I liked it better on the chicken for sure

This was way too hot for my taste.  It makes a lot so I am going to have to "water down" the left overs to use it for anything else.  I think I would cut the cayenne pepper down to 1 Tbs.

One of the best dinners I've made on AllRecipes.  I turned it into a spicy chicken sandwich and it was absolutely delicious!  The only things I added were sliced mozzerella cheese on a dutch crunch roll with a little mayo.  So Good!

This rub is great!  Mixed up a batch and baked some chicken breasts with it to put on a salad.  Tasted amazing!  Definitely my favorite seasoning for chicken and the best part is you have some left over for future use with this recipe.  Try it!

This was very hot but otherwise did not have enough flavor. the recipe definitely relied too much on heat. I do think it is a good start though. I think with an addition or two it could be really good. I am thinking about adding this to barbeque sauce and grilling it. It just needs something else added to it.

DELISH! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I squirted some Sriracha hot sauce and threw in some red pepper flakes (I LOVE SPICY FOOD). I also cut down on the salt and added olive oil to make a marinade. I marinated it overnight and threw it on the grill and WOW! it was spicy but flavorful and delicious! I loved it so much that I am marinating another set in the fridge RIGHT NOW. Awesome recipe :)

We just bought a new grill and my dh is grill crazy. This recipe has been his favorite grilling one so far. We use less cayenne depending on the company. Tonight we are making sandwhiches with it, but the other day we made a salad. It tastes like blackened chicken!

I love how this is so quick, yet so flavorful. No need to marinate for hours. I saved half the seasoning rub to use later (I only cooked 2 chicken breast). They were great on the grill, and spicy but not too hot all. I don't think I like thyme so I just used a little.

This was so spicy that it made my nose run lol  I loved all the spicy food though so it was actually no biggy!!!  The only thing that I did differently was use olive oil before and after applying the seasoning it made it 100 times better and it kept all the seasoning from burning off :D

I used thin sliced chicken breasts, so I only cooked them for 3 minutes each side.  Delicious.  I used some garlic sauce that I got from a rotisserie chicken restaurant.  Very yummy.

This is fabulous! I did cut the cayenne in half. I also added 1 Tbsp of allspice. The sweet flavor cut through some of the spiciness. The meat was tender and juicy. The flavor has a great kick. I also sprinkled a little lime juice and 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar over the chicken breast before putting it in the rub. SO GOOOD!!!

My husband liked it very much. Both of us like real spicy food. But this one is just ok for me. Probably because I made it a bit dry somehow. I baked it at 350 degree for 40 mins. I just used dried basil instead of thyme. It's not my favorite flavor even though my husband liked it. So I gave it 4.

WONDERFUL.  I made it for dinner last night.  The chicken was gone in 2 minutes.  When I got up this morning, I took out more chicken breasts and cooked them with the left over rub to have on romaine salad for lunch!

EXCELLENT!  Did a few minor changes ... I also added olive oil and made into a marinade because my chicken was frozen ... let thaw and marinade in fridge. Didn't have onion or garlic powder ... added garlic salt and halved reg salt ... also added dried cilantro and red pepper flake. Reduced all to tsp. made enough for 2 large breasts!  My partner wants more tomorrow night! Absolutely Delicious!!!!!

I give this four stars for flavor, but sadly it was too hot for me. I didn't want to give up on it and I do enjoy spicy(but in moderation) so I used this recipe for chicken wings instead and added some Red Hot Buffalo sauce. Delicious!

I just got done cooking this!Didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I substituted with a hint of basil. Couldn't use the grill so I settled with a frying pan. Still turned out wonderful and incredibly spicy, and I'm a sucker for spicy foods! A+ my friend!!!

NOTE: This should not be attempted in a Foreman grill. I had to pop the chicken in the oven in order to cook it thoroughly.  I did practically everything else as described but didn't add the same amount of ingredients.   Overall the chicken was really good and I'm glad that I have leftovers!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't find it spicy, although I had to substitute chili pepper for the cayenne pepper and I omitted the black pepper since I can't stand the stuff and don't have any in the house.  That probably affected the level of heat.  Otherwise, it had a great flavor, and I can't wait to use up the leftover mix!  Thank you for the great recipe! :)

My young boys are fairly picky eaters and when it comes to spicy they are wary, but this was a favourite from the first bite.   All I did differently was tone down the cayenne pepper a bit - and with some mashed potatoes and vegetables it was just awesome on a cool rainy evening!

Loved this!  Just the right amount of heat for me (I don't like things too spicy), and my husband (he loves spicy foods).  Perfect middle of the road for us both. Will make regularly.

Very tasty! Like some other people I did reduce the cayenne pepper by 1/2 but followed exactly the rest. A great all-purpose sprinkle or rub.

This was absolutely wonderful!  First, I flattened my chicken breasts, added the rub, grilled them up and let them cool down.  Once cool, I cut them into strips and ate them alongside "Minty Orzo Lentil and Feta Salad" and it made the perfect picnic combo, and leftovers for lunch at work. Great recipe Barbara!

Great dish! I added a little less paprika and cayenne pepper than the recipe called for, but I think it still would have been delicious if I had used the same measurements listed in the recipe. I'm definitely making this again!

SPICY! This recipe had great flavor, the only thing different I will do the next time is cut the thyme in half, or just not use it, it tends to be a little overpowering.

Spicy is certainly a good way to describe this recipe!  Some spicy dishes do not live up to their name; thankfully this is not one of them.  I love spicy food and this was right up my alley!  The only change I made was to bake them in the oven as I do not have a grill.  The dish uses a great combination of seasonings and is fantastic!

This was a nice and spicy recipe. I served the chicken over white rice, which served to tone down some of the kick. There was plenty of seasoning left over that I plan to use on grilled veggies.

boyfriend loved the spice rub, I've used it on chicken and steak. I didn't have onion powder so I used more garlic powder and I was out of cayenne so I just used chili powder. Thanks for the recipe! update: I keep a little container of this and use it on everything! I've added it to a chicken tenders recipe on here, to burgers, pork, always goes over great!

This was not so delish.  I made the recipe as written, and the chicken was so spicy my husband and I couldn't eat it.  And we like spicy food!  I told my husband I'd make it again sometime without so much heat, and he told me not to bother.  I'm glad I tried it though!

These were pretty spicy but I cut it with blue cheese dressing and making it into a sandwich with the French Bread Baguette recipe from this site.  Yummy!  I also didn't grill them.  Used the broiler.  Six minutes per side on fairly thick breasts was perfect!

I didn't have the pepper so I made a similar rub using al of the ingredient and cumin. 
I also made the chicken in the frying pan using a little olive oil and some white wine vinegar.
I rubbed the chicken with the spices and saved a little of it to sprinkle on the bottom of the frying pan with the oil. While one side of the chicken cooked, for about 6 minutes I sprinkled some of the white wine vinegar and some low salt adobe on the top, then i flipped it over and repeated.
The chicken was so juicy and flavorful and my extremely picky boyfriend loved it too. He was almost licking the plate.

The mixture is well-balanced, but I couldn't bring myself to leave the chicken dry!  So I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard and two tablespoons of olive oil and let the chicken marinate before putting it on the grill.

I'm obviously one of the few who did not like this. We couldn't eat it at all so instead it went in the trash! I followed the recipe almost exactly; I used a little less kosher salt than it called for and a little less cayenne. It just seemed too much when putting this together and I was right. My husband and I thought it was too salty and too hot, and we both usually say: "the hotter the better" but unfortunately, not in this case. I will say the chicken was moist and tender but I will not be using this rub again. Thanks anyway -- I had such high hopes. :(

When they say spicy, they mean spicy! This recipe was very easy to assemble and the aroma was wonderful. The taste however was WAY TOO HOT for me and my daughters taste, my husband on the other hand, who happens to like spicy foods loved it. When I make this again I will definately cut down on the cayenne pepper.

This is soooo good.  We fired up the grill and only added 1/4 tsp. of each spice to see how we would like it.  We used about a half cup of honey with a tablespoon of white vinegar mixed in the spices minus thyme and basted the chicken with it.  Turned out so good. Will mix the spices to use this summer minus the thyme.  Hubby don't like.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I liked this recipe becasue the chicken was nicy and juicy and had a super color to it.  However, for my own personal taste, I will cut down on the cayenne and I will substitute something else for the tyme.

Good spice mix....nice amount of heat. I had to sub rosemary for the thyme. I rubbed chicken breasts on both sides, fairly liberally with the spices, and the brolied about 8-10 minutes per side. It was fast and tasty. and we are happy to not have to buy the spice mixes at the store anymore.

My husband made this last night. I told him the recipe over the phone and he did not understand to not use all the seasoning mix. So he cut the chicken into pieces and used all the seasoning! He cooked it on the stove top with a tiny amount of olive oil. Once the chicken was done it was too hot to eat, because he did not follow the recipe. He toned it down with a little lemom juice and served over salad with a side of garlic bread. It was a great dinner!

My family loved it! Based on the reviews I left much of the cayenne out of the kids rub. I baked the chicken first on 350 for 30 minutes or so. Then I cut the chicken into strips or chunks (depending on preference) and put them into a quesadilla with cheese and red onion and green pepper. I baked the quesadillas on 350 until the cheese was melted. We topped them with more cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and salsa. YUM! My kids ate it all up... which is rare. We left the onions and peppers out of theirs. So good. We will make this again... probably next week!

Great recipe... didn't change anything.  A little spicy for children so I left out the cayenne pepper when I first made the batch... seasoned the children's breast and then added the cayenne pepper for the remaining breasts.

We LOVE this spice mixture!!  It's such a nice change and worked great on our boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I also dusted chicken wings with it before baking and then added the traditional hot sauce afterward and it gave it the kick we had been missing.  Great recipe and I have plenty left to use as I need it!!

This is a very tasty recipe. I've done it several times so far. I marinade the chicken overnight and broil or grill it. One time I also toss the cooked chicken in hot buffalo sauce with a little butter and make buffalo chicken sandwiches.

When I made these I only had garlic salt so I left the "salt" out totally, no onion powder and used Hungarian Paprika. Otherwise went by the recipe. My boyfriend and his adult daughter thought the chicken breasts tasted AWESOME. The rub impressed me so much I'm going to make some up (after getting correct ingredients) and give as stocking stuffers to my "grilling" friends and co-workers. I like this one because it doesn't have to sit overnight. I let mine sit about 30 minutes and plopped it on the grill as suggested. YUMMY!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Well I was prepared for HOT chicken after reading the other reviews. It was very good, however I did not find it to be too hot at all. Our kids tried some too, although much less rub than what I had, and they liked it too. I put the rub in a sealable bag with the meat to coat it. I will be adding more cheyenne pepper to my leftover mix, and I can't wait to try it again. I cooked some extra chicken with more cheyenne pepper and cut it into strips. I've put them on my salad for lunch for the last 3 days and it is wonderful! This is a keeper!

This rub is great.  It was a nice change to ordinary chicken breasts.  I only used 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper because I'm a wimp with hot food. :)  I didn't have any onion powder so I just omitted it.  It was still fantastic.  It tastes even better the next day.

Yum! I rubbed chicken breasts with this mix and cooked them on my George Foreman grill (we don't have an outdoor grill). It was great! Chicken stayed moist, and the spice blend tasted good. Almost too spicy for me, but I am not very tolerant of spicy foods. A keeper!

Paired with a long grain and wild rice dish, tiny tomatoes, Japanese melon, and red onion/garlic marinated in my homemade Italian dressing, and some purple Japanese string beans in butter and heavy cream!  it was terrific flavors mixing together!  Great meal!

This was just fabulous. I ended up baking the chicken with some of the spice mixture on top only. My family didn’t find this too spicy but might have if I had coated the entire chicken with it. I would cut the cayenne by half if concerned about the heat. I didn’t find the thyme overpowering nor did anyone else. This spice mixture would be great on other meat. Definitely will make again.

Good and spicy!  Easy to make ahead of time. We make a bag of the spices so we have it on hand ready for cooking. Who needs bread when you’ve got herbs and spices!

I made no changes to this recipe and I believe it's the best chicken we've ever grilled! We also used chicken thighs and when we put them on the grill the next day (10 mins.) the skin got a little crispy and so full of flavor. Extremely easy and fast to prepare.

Unlike most reviewers I think the salt is a necessary part of the recipe. Those that complain that there's heat with no flavor seem to be leaving the flavor out when they skip the salt imho. However I most heartily agree with those that use half the cayenne and thyme. I'll be making this a lot. ;)

I made the recipe as is, it was spicy but we like spicy.   We really enjoyed the flavor and don't think it needs to change at all.    I didn't make on the grill, rather in a cast iron pan--did the searing first and then slow cooked, super tender and flavorful.

Didn't have thyme so we used sage instead and added more of each spice because we like our chicken spicey. It was very good I would definitely make it again.

It is spicy as the name implies.  If you like a serious kick with flavor you'll enjoy this recipe.  I personally thought it was too spicy but my son loved it.  Matter of heat level preference I suppose.   Recipe makes extra spice mixture so I'll make it again since the spices are already combined and and ready.

This is my go to for pre-prepared delicious salad lunches. 
 Slight mods for chicken:
1) clean and pound chicken breasts to 1/2” thickened
2) marinate in lemon juice for 1 hour prior to seasoning

Season and cook each side 3-4 min

Baby spinach
Carrot slices 
1/4 avocado
Parmesan crisp (cook grated at 400 degrees for 5.5 min)
Thin slice chicken on top
Squeeze 1/2 fresh lemon juice on top

Best dang salad ever!

The rub was great, I did use only half of the cayenne pepper.  If you don't like it spicy then you can leave it out, still a great rub.  I have also used it on a tuna steak, also just as great.  Can't wait to try it on  T-bone steak on the grill.

Delicious - I don't know what else to say.  I cooked it in the broiler, on high, and the family loved it.  This is a very easy, quick recipe that provides a very good looking entrée  with very little preparation.  Simply mix the dry mix ingredients, rub them on the chicken, and cook!

It didn't wow me or my family enough to keep the recipe.  Glad I cut down half on the cayenne and thyme as others suggested.  Even still, my husband complained about it being too hot.  Too many great recipes out there to keep the mediocre ones.

I followed the suggestions to add olive oil and put in a storage baggie and soak all day.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic crushed and 3 tablespoons of white vinegar.  Very tasty but too hot.  I would go less on the Cayenne Pepper.

My husband and I don’t typically like the breasts of the chicken so I am always looking for ways to prepare them.  We also like spicy food so this was perfect!

I made this according to the recipe (except cut the salt by a third due to my husbands preference).  I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't eat them, but my husband LOVED them!  Definitely a keeper!

My family doesn't like really spicy foods, but this one was perfect. I used the rub on chicken breasts and had a lot left over, so I put it in a spice jar for later. Used it as a rub for back ribs on the BBQ and it was a hit with my friends and family! I'll always have a jar of this mix on hand now.

I used another reviewer’s recommendation and tossed it in oil and tossed it in the seasoning! It was GREAT. I took off a star because it took WAAAAY longer to grill than the listed time.

Took the advice of others and reduced the amount of cayenne pepper and it was the perfect amount of hot. It was veryyy delicious.

It was great. I didn't have a grill to cook it on, so I crisped the outside in a cast iron skillet, then transferred it over to the oven so it could finish cooking. Turned out great. I added a bit more cayenne to it, as I was looking for a bit more spice. I also downsized the recipe by converting everything to tsp instead just in case I didn't like to combo and didn't want to waste the spices.

I didn't have an cayenne on hand so I did add a little chili powder instead. Next time I would omit the salt as it tasted really salty to me. I would also use a little less chili powder/cayenne. This rub gave the chicken a nice kick. I wil make it again.

Easy,  tender, quick and delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I used only 2 TBLS of paprika, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. of pepper. It was raining hard so I used an indoor grill pan with PAM and cooked 3-4 minutes on each side,  just enough for strong grill marks. Then I baked on a foil covered cookie sheet for another 10 minutes at 350,  and served over rice with all the juice from the foil.   Next time I will make extra to keep for lunch over salad or leftovers!

Good flavor. If you can't use a grill for some reason Just lightly sear for about a minute or two per side then put in 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.

Wonderful flavor but cut down on how much you put on your chicken when you cook it. Very spicy. A little goes a long way.

Really good, but half the cayanne pepper. I found it still overly spicy but I used a bit of italian dressing to "dip" my chicken in before eating it and it lighten the "hot" and it was tasty. My son used ranch and he said that was good too.

I really like the seasoning but when you cut the breast into fourths there is just to much seasoning on one piece of meet so I highly recommend doing 4 halves of a chicken breast.
but other wise tasty everyone enjoyed it that there were no leftovers

Minor modifications  (i can't grill where i live), so i forgot to add cayenne pepper as well. But i placed it on a pan on the stove top, covered it with aluminum foil and made sure both sides were "good to go", after that i put the whole thing (pot included) and placed it all in the oven (on 400 degrees) and left it there for 8 minutes.

Paired it with baked asparagus and some sweet potato... definite repeat this was SO delicious!!!

I like this rub. I use it often on my chicken. I do add to it on occasion, since I like my chicken somewhat spicy. I use the leftover chicken in other things like sandwiches.

Just made this. Stuck to recipe except onion powder I used onion flakes so I put in two tablespoons instead of one. The breasts I bought where huge so I cooked 10 min a side, came out great. Not too spicy for me.

Amazing!! The only change I made was that I only added 1 tsp of black pepper and baked the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes on 425. The chicken had a great flavor and it was juicy! My kids and husband loved it... I will definitely be making this again! I even sprinkled the rub on my baked potato and corn on the cob! Thank you :)

I just tried out this recipe tonight. My boyfriend likes spicy, hot food so I actually added a touch more Cayenne pepper. I used really garlic cut up small in place of garlic powder. I didn't have any rub left over, I used all of it on 5 boneless, skinless chicken breast. Tossed them on the bbq. Delicious!  The only down side is that it was too spicy to share leftovers with our dog.

Not a favorite...the chicken breasts were not tender after baking at 350 for 45 minutes! Spice mixture was okay.

My husband liked this because he enjoys hot spicy foods. Me, not as much. Next time I will cut in half the cayenne and black peppers. I also cooked this on my Cuisinart panini press on med/med-high heat for about 8 minutes.

I didn't have any thyme (not big on it anyway). Instead, I used rosemary. It was good and spicy! I did read other reviews and used only half the cayenne. I halved the amount of all seasonings (1/4 cayenne), used it on 3 broiled (too cold to grill) chicken breast and have enough for 3 more. My sinuses are clear now! We will be having this again.

This rub is great!  I reduced the cayenne pepper by 50%.  I have used it on chicken and boneless pork chops.  Going to put it on a rib eye tonight then toss it on the grill.  I am sure that it will be awesome!

I didn't have a grill, so I pan fried the chicken with a little canola. Turned out great.

Because I changed the recipe a bit, I rated it at 4 stars. Loved these ingredients together.Instead of a rub, I used the ingredients as a marinade (only for about an hour) which all went into a gallon sized zip-loc. Instead of regular salt, I used seasoned salt for more flavor (which for me turns it into somewhat of a creole chicken). Also, instead of grilling, I baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes. Can I say, AMAZING?! Not just to me, but also to my boyfriend whose tastebuds seem to be fried because of his love for spicy food! He absolutely loved it, and might I quote "This is possibly the best chicken you have every made in your life!" This hit the spot for both of us! Though it was EXTREMELY SPICY (nose running and had the sniffles the whole time I ate it), I will definitely be making my version again soon!

This was easy and fast, but very very hot ! If you love hot spicy Chicken this is the one to keep. I didn't grill the chicken I broiled it. I love very very hot hot chicken it's was the hottest I have ever tried. Great rub.

I didn't make any changes this time around but if I do make it again, less salt. My taste buds are sensitive to it and I had to take some of the rub off of the chicken breasts.  I would make it again but I am going to modify it

I think this would be wonderful if the seasonings are mixed in with some bread crumbs, and then breaded and fried for a spicy chicken sandwich. I made it just the way the recipient said, and it really was much spicier than I thought it would be. We love spicy food at our house, and we almost couldn't handle it! It tasted great and I would love to make it again, either this way or on a sandwich. It was a little too salty to me, so I think maybe next time I will reduce the salt, but the flavor was great!

Tried this recipe and it was a hit in my house! My boyfriend couldn't stop telling me how delicious it was, we had seconds and it had the house smelling great. I personally thought the chicken was a little tough but over all a great recipe and will make again!!

I'm new to cooking, and thought this looked like an easier recipe for beginners. Easy, and turned out really well! Even though my boyfriend and I both like spicy food, I reduced the cayenne pepper just to be on the safe side, and it turned out nice and spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. I also reduced the salt a little bit, and baked it, since I didn't have a grill. 
I let the chicken breasts soak in olive oil for 20 minutes before coating them with the spice mixture, and then baked them in the oven wrapped in foil. I served them on a bed of baby spinach and they were tender and flavourful. 
Would recommend.

Lazy dinner go to! This recipe is fast to make and pretty healthy. The amount for the seasoning has A LOT of leftovers so if you don't want to bother with storing them, cut the recipe to about half. It can be a stand alone dish or it can be great with rice and vegetables.

Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and made a marinade.
Honestly marinated only 1 hr and grilled on low according to directions on time,turning frequently. Sliced and served on Chipolte
slaw (salad kit you find in most produce sections )  I drizzled a little lime juice over all of it then served. Awesome healthy dinner, and we have some leftover chicken for lunch tomorrow. For sure a repeat. Thanks!

This was ok. I cut the cayenne in half like others and omitted the salt. Spice level was good but there was a lack of flavor. I will stick with the spicy rub recipe I have. Thanks for sharing though.

It made the breasts very juicy, however they were so spicy it took away from the chicken taste. If you are making this recipe back off on the cayenne, or just use a bit of rub!

Super yummy! TWO BIG THUMBS UP! I did not use a grill, I fried it. I only made 1 serving because it would be a waste if I failed it but WOW! I should have made more! I used all the ingredients. I cut the breast half into 4 parts so the seasoning is sure to seep until the end and it did. Then I rubbed the seasoning on it, and then I mixed another seasoning with water and just dipped my seasoned chicken in that for about 20-30 minutes, and then I rub some more seasoning before I fried it. It was super yummy! Everyone from my family loved it!

Awesome flavor, but beware, it is very spicy! I serve with homemade white barbecue sauce to cool it down, delicious! I don't understand the reviews that say to cut out the salt because there is enough sodium in the dish (unless they are using garlic salt). If you like spicy, you'll love it.

This rub was really good. I did cut the cayenne and black pepper in half as I don't like too spicy but I think I would add still a little more next time.

Very spicy.  Good thing I made a cool cucumber and carrot salad on the side to help cool down our mouths from the very hot and spicy chicken breasts. Hubby really likes the spicy so I'll probably make these again but you really need to have something on the side to help cool things down.

I liked the rub as it is. I like spicy and my family has learned to like spicy! I rubbed chicken breasts, put them for a few minutes on a grill pan and then popped them into the oven for 20 minutes to cook through. Served on a bed of lettuce w/tomatoes, green onions and salsa for a fajita salad.

I used a teaspoon of cayenne instead of a tablespoon.  it turned out so great.

I use this recipe all the time.  I usually make a large batch of this so I always have it on hand.  It's great rubbed on chicken and then grilled or just cooked in a pan with olive oil and put in a sandwich.  One of my favorites on this site!

This recipe was pretty good!! Definitely helped with my "something spicy" craving. XD The only problem, I think, was the thyme was a little overpowering. Cleared up some sinuses in the house while it was cooking too! We were all coughing more than a little...though that might have been from the charring on the chicken more than the spicy seasoning. Over all though, I liked it. Just put a Hellman's Mayo & Hidden Valley Ranch mixture over top of it and it was great!

I didn't have any garlic powder or onion powder though so I substituted granulated garlic and chopped onion.

this was pretty tasty.. i scaled the amount down to one serving and used one pound of chicken breast pieces.. sauteed until cooked through.. i think it could have used a little bit more salt.. i also used a little less thyme b/c i was worried about it overpowering the dish.. ty for the recipe

I cut back on the thyme as per suggestions by other reviewers...so glad I did because it really is a strong flavor in this recipe. I enjoyed this with simpler plain sides to balance it out.

My husband really loved the chicken! I didn´t grill it, but prepared it in a pan and had a lovely flavour even though I didn´t add the onion powder and the cayenne pepper. Instead, I added crushed chilli and it worked very good!

I'm cheating a little because I haven't tried this yet ~ It's on tonight's menu. I noticed several comments about the thyme overpowering the flavor. It may be you batch of thyme not the amount called for in the recipe. I recently tossed a bottle of McCormick's dried thyme because it was too strong. McCormick is my go-to brand. A different batch of thyme turned out perfectly fine. Am excited to try this recipe! I tried this recipe as written and it was very good. I did, however, use 1 tablespoon smoked paprika and the remainder regular paprika.

This chicken was FANTASTIC!!! Unfortunately, I realized we didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted it with 2 TBS of Penzeys Red & Black Pepper Blend (and eliminated the black pepper the recipe called for). My husband LOVED it! Said it was the best chicken he ever tasted. Also, it was pouring down rain (& I was feeling lazy) so I baked the chicken breasts in a Pampered chef clay baking dish at 400 degrees & they really were delicious. Can't decide if I'll try grilling them next time or not- they were that good! Thank you for the recipe!

Makes a good spicy rub. My fiance and I love spice so it wasn't too spicy for our tastes but I can see that it would be too spicy for the average. Unless you're a spicy lover like us I'd suggest trying less cayenne and go from there.

I like spicy but this was WAY too much! I even cut the amount of cayenne and paprika but it was still very hot and really had no flavor...other then just hot! Like the idea of a rub but will not be making this again.

My husband loves spicy foods, this was a great recipe.  I made it into a marinade by adding a couple tbsp of olive oil.  He said he would like some white pepper added to it for the after burn effect.  I did and he said it made it perfect!

I just made this chicken and my whole family loved it. Not to spicy. The thyme does overtake the taste a bit, so i will use less next time. I also used the rub on some steam vegetables and asparagus and they came out delicious.

Made it...it was pretty good. I think I got too much rub on it though but I think that was my mistake. A little lighter next time and I think this'll be a nice easy meal in the future.

I coated the chicken in a combo of 2 t. Olive Oil and 2 t. Butter then added the rub. Might need a little more salt.

Nice recipe but it comes out better if you inject the seasoning along with rubbing some on the outside.  Gives it a lovely taste throughout the chicken.  You could either inject it with olive oil along with the seasoning or butter.

This recipe is tasty and spicy! I use most of the ingredients included such as: cayenne, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. 

I make into a marinade instead of a rub. I add olive oil, and white cooking wine, and a little splash of lemon juice.

I cook it on the Foreman Grill, and serve with rice and veggies. The hubby loves it!

I like spicy, so this recipe was a good, quick rub for grilled chicken!  Just be a careful on how much rub you put on the chicken.  That cayenne pepper can get pretty hot!  :)

This was good and nicely seasoned.  I cut way back on the seasoning mix and ended up making 1/2 serving which was just the right amount for two smallish chicken breasts.  I scaled the recipe to 1 serving and then cut that in half.  Worked just fine and no leftovers of the seasoning mix to get lost in my cupboard.

I give this a five for simplicity and a 3.5 for taste. I had six boneless, skinless, thin sliced chicken breasts.  I halved the recipe and had just the right amount of rub.  It was a little too cold to grill tonight so I put them in a glass baking dish and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Keep in mind, my breasts were very thin, yours might need longer, probably 40 minutes for full sized breasts.  I put in the full amount of cayenne and felt like it was a decent amount of spice but not too much.  If you have a sensitive stomach I would probably do half or 3/4 the amount called for.  After baking the chicken I put them on toasted bread with tomato lettuce and mayo for sandwiches.  Made the perfect light dinner.  I will use this recipe again.

Quick and delish! I followed the advice of others and cut down the cayenne to about 1 t, which made the spiciness level tolerable. Rather than using onion powder (I had none!) I sliced some onions and baked them on top of the chicken. Perfect compliments to a spinach salad!

Made this tonight and it came out great very good, but it doesn't make for an outstanding dish. I did as some others had and added 1/2 cup of olive oil and made a marinade then baked in oven. Will make this again, the only thing I might do differently is maybe do 2 tbs of thyme and 1 of parsley to mellow out the flavor of the thyme so you can focus on the spice more.

This had a good spicyness to it. I used half a pound of chicken tenderloins, used the other half with just salt and pepper and garlic powder for the kids. I grilled these on my goerge foreman, turned out well.

I tried this as a marinade as another reviewer suggested and it was okay. Tonight I was in a hurry for dinner and tried what I had left over as a rub and it was truly excellent! If you don't love spice as much as I do, you will want to cut down the cayenne a little, but I loved it as is.

This was *really* good. Husband wanted something spicy and this fit the bill. Plus I had all the ingredients on hand! I used about 1/2 the amount of cayenne pepper powder and it was plenty spicy. Our two teen boys weren't keen on it (I don't know why... they eat raw onions but don't like spicy food?!), but I am planning to make this one again, especially since the recipe made enough for several more grilling nights! Thanks for posting!

Very spicy, but tasty (and toned down) when paired with salad and dressing.  I've made this twice, and I will definitely make it again.

I just used this rub on chicken thighs and it was appealing to the eyes and tasty to the taste buds.  I will definitely use it again!

Really Good!!! Loved the way this tasted, I also added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes, tbsp of mrs. dash, and replaced one of the garlic powder tbsp's with garlic salt (Im addicted)... Grilled them on the George Forman after pounding out the breasts for faster cooking- Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 1/2 a tbl. cayanne because I was afraid it would be too spicy. I should of used 3/4 tbl. to give it more of a kick. I did not have any thyme on hand so I used rosemary instead and it made for a quick yummy dinner. The leftovers made a great grilled chicken salad. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was dang spicy, even after cutting down the cayenne. Serving it over salad greens really cuts down the hot. I think I rubbed a little too much on the chicken! I will try it on steak or shrimp next time. Thanks for the yum!

It was okay.  I took the recommendation of others and cut down on the cayenne.  Glad I did.  A little salty for me too.  It was good, but I have had a lot better.  Thanks for sharing though.

WOO!! Spicy! We loved it! Very good flavor, but if you don't enjoy spicy foods I would cut back or even omit the cayenne pepper.

Who would have thought such a simple mixture would be so great?!  I didn't have thyme, but it still turned out excellent.  I rubbed it on some talapia and then pan-fried it.  It is kind of like a "blackened" flavor.  We didn't think it was too spicy, but we love hot food.  I can't wait to make it again, this time with the thyme.  Delicious.

Delicious... perfect for a wrap with a little garlic mayo. I was surprise how well the rub coated the chicken and the strong flavor. Didn't have any onion powder but still fab.

We love spicy foods but we did not care for this chicken.  It left a sour taste that would have been best suited in something like a gyro. after eating it.

My family loves this recipe.  It's so easy to make and only takes a few minutes to barbeque.  Whenever we have a get-together we make it and our friends always have wonderful things to say about it.  The only change I made was omitting the cayenne pepper.  SUPERB!

This chicken is wonderful. It's great if your dieting or trying to eat low carb.It's so easy and so good. Heads up- it is very spicy (which I love) but if you don't like spicy food this ones not for you.

This was pretty good and very easy to throw together. Based on other's reviews that it was too spicy, I halved the cayenne. It still had some kick, but next time I'll go full throttle on the spice...we can take it. Might be good with a pinch of curry or cumin as well. I rubbed the spices into the chicken a good 3-4 hours before cooking and sprayed with olive oil. Like some reviewers, I broiled the chicken 8-10 min per side and it turned out perfect. I wasn't blown away by it, but I will say it makes a pretty tasty meal if you're pressed for time or just don't feel like spending hours in the kitchen. And since the recipe makes enough for future use, that cuts the prep time even more.

Very good, might be a bit spicy for some though (you may want to cut down a little on the cayenne pepper).  This is a quick and easy recipe to make - I often use it when I am in the "I do not feel like cooking mood."

2 thumbs up, Barbara.  We loved this recipe.  We used your recipe with beef fillet steak, simply marinading the meat for an hour or so in the mix before grilling on a lightly oiled grill.  The flavours were perfect and the meat very tender.

It was so easy to make ahead and we will always have it on hand.  I didn't need to change a thing.  One of our friends is a very fussy eater and loved this!!

Due to spices I had on hand I substituted the 1 Tbsp. Thyme with 1/2 Tbsp. Rosemary (not a big fan of Rosemary), and 1 Tbsp. of Cayenne with 1Tbsp. Lousianna Hot Sauce.  The rub turned a little paste like in some spots due to the liquid.  This was such a quick and easy recipe!  And per a previous suggestion I dipped pieces into sour cream and look forward to trying it on a taco and Caesar salad!!

This spice combination is handy to keep around when you want to make some grilled chicken in a hurry.  It's satisfying and makes decent chicken when time is limited.  So mix up the spices and save for day when you are rushed.  You'll enjoy the results.  But if you have time, I recommend marinating the chicken instead.

Delicious!! The seasoning is also great on potatoes. I love it as is, my husband likes it better with half the paprika replaced with hot chili powder for an extra kick.  We did this in the winter so used a grill pan on the stove instead of an outdoor grill.  Delicous and very pretty too!

It was refreshing.  I only put in 1/2 tablespoon of cayenne b/c we have kids in the house. We really enjoyed!

delicious.  didnt change a thing.
made the chicken crispy and very flavorful.  my husband has a higher threshhold for hot so his mouth wasnt on fire like mine, but he thought it was excellent too.   served with cooling guacamole and calypso rice (from allrecipes).   highly recommended.  gonna try it with steak very soon.

Very tasty!  I quartered the recipe cause I didn't want to have a lot of leftover in case I didn't like it and now I wish I had made more!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome, nice and spicy. I can't wait to try it on some steaks. My husband thought it was the best rub he has ever tasted.

I only used half of the cayenne recommended. It was perfectly spicy for us. My husband loved it more than I did. Next time I think I will just cut the chicken breast into strips before cooking so it cooks faster.

Great rub Barbara! I halved the cayenne pepper but I think next time I'll use the whole tbsp. This is a great way to flavor chicken without adding lots of fat. Can't wait to try it on pork and veggies.

Excellent Rub, Fantastic Taste, the more you use the better the taste. I only used 1 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper as suggested and it was perfect for our taste. I tried it on pork loin, chicken and even put it in beef broth to spice it up a bit. It was very tasty in all. A bit hit at our house, I will keep plenty on hand!

Yummy, this was really good...hard to rub on so I sprinkled it on like I do with seasoning salt.  I had it with a ceasar salad.  Awesome flavour!

I would make this again for a change of pace, but it's not a top favorite.

This was really good on chicken, but a little too spicy for children!
