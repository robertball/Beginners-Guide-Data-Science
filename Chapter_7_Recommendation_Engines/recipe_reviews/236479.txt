Although I drink my coffee black I decided to give this a try and was quite surprised that it was not too sweet with a hint of coconut flavor.

I really liked the maple syrup flavor in coffee; I'll have to try that again sometime. However, this was way too sweet for me, and all I could taste was maple syrup. I think next time 2 teaspoons would be plenty for 1 cup of coffee.
