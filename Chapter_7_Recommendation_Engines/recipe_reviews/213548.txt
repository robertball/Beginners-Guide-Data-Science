this was a good recipie but i felt the potatoes were a bit bland. I also used black beans instead of baked beans that might of changed things a bit ,  but i don't think it changed the flavor of the potatoes. thank you for the recipie though.

It was pretty good. I personally prefer spicier food, so I doubled the spices.

This recipe worked great. My vegetarian husband really liked it. I had to make a few substitutions and removals (no curry leaves) but it still worked out great which tells me the fundamentals of the recipe are right. Plus it's an effective way to clean out the fridge when it comes to using vegetables.
