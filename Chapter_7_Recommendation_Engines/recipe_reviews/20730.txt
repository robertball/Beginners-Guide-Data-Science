So I had this can of garbanzo beans sitting on my shelf and decided to make some hummus. However, it had to be something simple because I didn't have much else. 

I found this recipe and gave it a try. In all honesty I did stray from Erin's true recipe, but its close enough to say it was a GREAT basis to start with. I added some extra virgin olive oil (rather than the bean liquid) and salt. Instead of garlic cloves I subsituted 3 tsp of granulated garlic. Instead of the jalapeno, I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper. After blending it all, I tasted it, and added a few shakes of spice as necessary.

Also, its a good idea to cover this with plastic wrap and then allow it to sit in the fridge for at least an hour so that all the flavors can mellow and mix together!

This hummous was excellent, and received rave reviews from my guests.  I didn't miss the tahini, and loved the addition of fresh jalepeno, it was just spicy enough.  Next time I will double the amount of the garbanzo bean liquid to 2 Tbsp. for a more smooth texture.  But there will certainly be a next time!

This hummus was super easy and so good!  I'm a "hummus snob" too. I was skeptical about leaving out the tahini.   I added a bit more garlic, a tsp of black pepper, a dash of tamari, and a chopped up green onion to give it some of the flavors of my fave Moosewood recipe.  Great!  I'm getting ready to make my second batch.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is easily scalable to much larger amounts.  One thing I noticed is that in larger amounts, it started to get a bit too thick for the food processor to handle.  My solution was to add a bit of crushed ice and water.  It came out creamy and really good.  

Incidentally, I used dried garbanzos soaked overnight and boiled 3-4 hours instead of canned.

This is a great recipe.  Best of all...it is soooooo quick!  I added a little less garlic, 2 sundried tomatoes (originally packed in oil), and a little more salt.  I also used pickled jalapenos because  didn't have and fresh ones.  The sundried tomatoes gave it a wonderful flavor and a really pretty reddish color.  I served it with pita chips yesterday at my Superbowl party for those of us who want a healthier alternative to chips and dip.  This was a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again and again.  It's so much cheaper and better than store bought hummus.

Very tasty. It was my first time making hummus and I needed a healthy version because our guest has high blood pressure and tahini jacked up the sodium and fat. We weren't eating greek so authenticity wasn't an issue. I also added cilantro, cayenne pepper and paprika. I served it with warmed pitas and red bell pepper.

I, like the other reviewers, will never buy store-bought hummus again! It is just too easy and tasty to do it at home. (And MUCH less expensive.) The amount of garlic was a bit strong. I like garlic and it was even too strong for me. I adjusted for that the second time I made it. I also added  a splash of olive oil and more of the bean liquid to smooth out the hummus. It would have been a bit too think without it. A great base hummus recipe that can be jazzed up a million ways. Thanks so much!

This did not taste like the hummus I have had in restaurants. The jalepeno's are strange, not adding to the normal greek flavor. We ended up throwing it out. I would not make this again.

This is a tasty recipe that even my picky 12 year old likes and asks for!  For a different twist, I have added a couple of drops of sesame oil.  Give it a try!  It doesn't last long at my house

Great low-fat recipe for hummus!  I substituted about a quarter tsp of cayenne pepper for the jalapeno, and it turned out delicious!

Great recipe, I highly recommend it; super easy to make. Didn't have jalapeno or cumin, so I left out the peppers & added curry powder instead. I played around with the amounts of bean juice & lemon juice (added a bit more to make it smoother) and added a teaspoon of olive oil. Be warned, 3 cloves of garlic makes a SUPER-GARLICKY hummous. Vary as needed! I'm never buying hummous again!

I just made this, substituting Great Northern Beans as son has food allergies which include chickpeas and sesame seeds.  I added a handful of fresh cilantro and doubled the cumin.  Wonderful!  I could eat it all right now!  Next time, I will definitely double this recipe.

This was a truly easy recipe.  I used 1 T of the reserved bean liquid and made the following additions:  2 T fresh Italian parsley (minced), 1/4 t paprika, and 1/2 t salt.  My jalapeno pepper amount was 2 peppers; the kick is great.  Thanks for this great, homemade hummus!

WOW! This is a really good and easy hummus recipe! I was pleasantly surprised, considering I didn't have Tahini (a sesame seed paste). I didn't let that deter me from making this recipe, which I doubled also. From a couple reviews I read, I added several shakes of salt and pepper. Then I added a small amount of sesame oil (probably 1/4 tsp. for a double recipe). I actually made the hummus without the sesame oil and it was still pretty good, but when I read the review about adding the oil, I had to put the oil it and I am so glad I did!! I do have to say that the 1 Tbsp. of bean liquid per batch was not nearly enough liquid, so I did add a couple Tbsp. of olive oil and even added about 1/2 cup more of the bean liquid! I know that seems that my hummus would be runny, but it's not. Don't be shy to tweak!! I am going to go eat my hummus now, have fun! 

P.S. I am doing what's called a "Daniel Fast", which is all fruit, veggies, nuts, beans and whole grains (basically anything that grows from a seed)...anyway, an approved fasting food is hummus and I knew I could find a recipe that was within my requirements! http://daniel-fast.com/

This hummus is GREAT.  I made it for a potluck and we ate it before I could take it so I had to remake it!  I suggest you double the recipe.  I will definately be making this one again.

Tasty! Everybody loved it at the last gathering. Just be sure to be careful with the jalapenos - seeding, dicing, etc. I used oil because I didn't have any lemon juice and it was great!
Way better than prepared hummus at the grocery store.

This hummus is better than store-bought and not very hard to prepare.  I will use only 1 jalepeno next time, it was a little too spicy.

One caveat on my rating.. I did add to the recipe, but as another reviewer said, this made a great base to start with.  I used all ingredients noted and added a splash of olive oil, 2 TBSP red onion, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 TBSP cilantro, and sea salt and pepper.  Also, I needed to add about 5 TBSP total of the garbanzo juice to thin out the recipe.  

This was so delicious and perfect!  I loved it and totally recommend, especially if you prefer your hummus wihtout the tahini.

This was great! This was my second attempt at making hummus and this recipe is a keeper! I did add a little olive oil and I didn't have jalapenos - I'll have to try them in it next time! Thanks Erin!

My husband wouldn't kiss me for two days, and the garlic adds (surprisingly) enough heat for me, so I didn't use the jalapeno.  Good hummus, though.

Very good, very easy and...not unhealthy. The only change I made was using pickled jalapenos from the jar since I didn't have fresh on hand. My husband really liked this and he doesn't generally like hummus.

Making it in a blender was NOT easy. I made this recipe as is and it didn't turn out so great. I added a lot of oil and lemon juice because it seemed too dry. After a few days sitting in the fridge though, it started to taste a lot better.

I didn't have any jalapeno peppers so I added a can of drained rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  Very good and so easy to make.  The tomatoes gave it a nice texture so there was no need to add any "yucky-slimey" bean juice.

Yummy recipe very garlicky...mmmmm. However, Do NOT omit the olive oil. It doesn't make it healthier, just makes it lower in fat, - but olive oil is healthy fat.

This tastes nothing like hummus, it just tastes like chickpea paste. I prefer a traditional recipe that includes tahini and olive oil (which has GOOD fats in it). I tried this because of all the rave reviews.  Anyway, I was going to serve it at a party, but I won't call this hummus.

Very good and very healthy.  You can add whatever you like to this and it will turn out great.  I made this for a get together I attended with old friends and everyone liked it.  Next time I make it i will add either red peppers or artichokes.  I served this with carrots, celery, red, yellow and orange peppers.  My hubby keeps asking me when I'm going to make again.

Good but I don't think I added enough jalepeno, only had 1 whole one.  Used olive oil instead of juice from beans.  Added extra cumin.  Still needs something more, probably the jalepeno.

I love this! It is the perfect base for whatever your taste preferences may be. I like to add a little extra cayenne pepper and top with fresh tomatoes. I can eat the entire thing with a glass of white wine and pretzel thins. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This hummus was surprising! I have only ever made it with tahini, but was drawn to this because without the tahini and oils it makes it lower in fat calories (however the nutritional info for this recipe are not correct!) It is very good, light textured. Although I am sure it is good with jalapenos I substituted sun-dried tomatoes! yum!

Easy and yummy! My Tupperware food processor didn't get the creamy texture, but it still tasted great! I did only use two cloves of garlic instead of 3 and omitted the jalapenos (I don't like spicy). Will definitely be making again!

Great recipe!  I changed it a bit by adding two roasted red peppers and 5 jalapeno slices (both out of a jar), a tiny bit of olive oil and some salt and pepper.  It is great!  I can't stop eating it!

YUMMY!!!  I agree with everyone else and will refuse to buy store bought hummus ever again!  Used less lemon juice, and added parsley.  Tastes better if it's been in the fridge for awhile!

Great recipe. This was the first time I have made hummus, though I have been buying it for years, and it turned out good.  This is very simple and quick recipe, though I don't know that I would serve it to company over store bought, but for my purposes it's great.

This hummus was good and used very little ingredients. I omitted the jalepenos and added 3 sundried tomatoes instead. The only thing I didn't like was the texture, it was a little too thick for my liking. Maybe adding some tahini will make it smoother.

Very simple recipe and much cheaper to make than to buy.  I think it should be left in frig overnight to enhance flavors.  We added more garlic.  Experiment with different spices and flavors.

Yum, I love this recipe.  I did make a couple of minor changes. i used 3 tsps of lemon juice and added some raw sesame seeds and also used extra virgin olive oil along with the juice of the beans.  So delicious.  Did I mention its 4am and I just had to try it .  It was worth it.

I made this awhile back without the jalapenos, added a jar of artichoke hearts, adjusted the seasonings, and we all LOVED it! Last night I decided to make it again and I followed the recipe exactly. It was WAY too spicy, and I like spice. I added a second can of garbanzo beans, more liquid, some olive oil, a few drops of sesame oil, then another 1/2 tsp of cumin, and it was finally right! So - its great as a base if you add your own stuff, but not "as-is".

My husband uses this as a base recipe for hummus weekly.  I prefer it as-written, but he perfers it to pack a bigger punch and usually adds extra garlic and/or jalapeno.  I love that this hummus does not call for tahini which, while necessary for an authentic hummus, is not something I have in my pantry.

i left out the jalapenos as well...and added olive oil and didn't use much of the bean liquid.  it was still very delicious- quick and easy.  next time i think i'll try adding in some roasted red peppers!

Next time, I'll use a little less jalapeno because it was a bit spicy. But it's delicious!

I used jalepenos in a jar, about a quarter of a cup.  You many not even need that much - it was a little spicy - but I like that!  Turned out wonderfully!  Love, love, love the no fat hummus!

A good base recipe with room for other ingredients... Personally I'd only use one clove of garlic, as the first time I made it, two cloves were still too strong (for me). Also because I thought it could use some tahini, but did not have any on hand, I added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter which worked surprisingly well.

Wow!  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, increased the cumin to 1 tsp, and added about 3 tbls of water.  EXCELLENT!!!!  By far my favorite hummus, has great flavor!

try adding Tahini for a more earthy, robust flavor.
good Tahini will knock your socks off, so dont use too much, but just enogh to make it thick.

I located this because I had no Tahini on hand and no time to run out...I am glad I did.  I added an extra clove of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice.  I also streamed in a bit of olive oil for creaminess and it was fresh and delicious tasting!  This is a great recipe to have on hand forlast minute snack ideas!!!  p.s. It tastes even better the next day!

I've always loved hummus but have never made it myself. As my first attempt, this was a really good and easy hummus recipe. I agree with previous reviewers that you'd need to taste as you're making it and add or subtract seasonings as you go along. I ended up adding more jalapeno peppers, another dash of cumin, a quick drizzle of olive oil and a bit more lemon. Refrigerating it overnight really helped enhance the taste. I loved it!

Yum, I love this!!  It's the easiest hummus I've made, and the healthiest.  I just joined weight watchers, so this is exactly what I was looking for for a veggie dip.  I used maybe 8 jarred jalapenos and about 3 tbs. of the reserved liquid.

It needs way more liquid.  I have a new blender, bur it clogs up.  Any suggestions?  I did add a Lot more liquid to make it work/  How did it work for those that did not add more liquid?  Is there a trick?

I have just recently fallen in love with hummus and have been purchasing another brand which adds up quickly!  This recipe is awesome!!!!  I really appreciated it!  I just added a dab of olive oil and a little more of the juice reserve and it was perfect - I will add less garlic next time, though.  Otherwise - the best!

Great recipe! Super easy, quick, very healthy and delish too! I added an extra tablespoon of bean juice and a teaspoon of olive oil to get a smoother consistency.  Tossed in a little parsley too.  I used jalepenos from a jar- tasty! Next time will try sun-dried tomatoes.

The recipe followed as directed was not good however it did provide a good base to build off of. I have made this several times now and I think I've perfected it by adding olive oil, more cumin, chili powder, and a dash of red pepper.

This is a great recipe! Who knew it was so easy to make hummus at home! I didn't want to run out to the store so I used garlic powder and roasted red peppers and olives instead of fresh jalapeños, it came out great! Like other reviews, I didn't use the reserved bean liquid but olive oil instead- so good!

I've used this hummus recipe for a couple of years now.  I've made it as written, which I find to be too garlicky for my personal taste.  I've made the following modifications, based on other reviews and then added to, which I love:
- Drain the bean juice but don't rinse the beans (since it calls for adding bean juice back anyway.
- Add 1/4 tsp salt
- Add about 1/4 cup of julienned sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil, let their olive oil come with them (instead of adding separate olive oil).
- No garlic cloves, instead used about 1tsp garlic paste.
- Add 1/4 tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp red pepper

DELICIOUS!

I made hummus for the first time last night! I'm pretty particular when it comes to hummus, and I don't like most grocery store ones.  I have been getting mine from a Kosher deli a few towns away...until now!

I halved the garlic (1.5 cloves), but I think 1 clove may be good for next time (I am a garlic lover also, but it was a little overpowering, since it is raw garlic).  Didn't add the peppers, but added a few pinches of paprika and some olive oil.

After blending in the food processor, I felt like the hummus was still chunky and it had a "beans" aftertaste.  I was kind of disappointed and decided to just put it in the fridge overnight.  But when I tried it today, like some other reviewer said, the flavors blend together when in the fridge, and there was no "bean" taste.

I'm glad I didn't call it a wash after my first taste!

I made your recipe as written, and had these problems. First, I used a blender not a food processor, so it took longer than 5 minutes to get the desired smoothness. It also took more water. I used my teapot water rather than what was in the can because I didn't want the extra salt. If I only used a tablespoon of liquid I would have burnt out my blender motor. It ended up being more like a half cup of water to get it loose enough to blend. I would rather not be told whether or not oil is healthy for me, should be personal choice, so I added olive oil to mine. It made a looser paste than probably intended, but that's OK. What I appreciated about this recipe is not having to buy a special ingredient I wouldn't otherwise use (tahini), and I don't like the taste of sesame anyway. Next time I would only use two cloves - three raw cloves is overpowering even for a garlic lover. I think I'll play with the seasonings, too. Otherwise I think it's a solid base. I eat my dips with a spoon - saves on carbs for me!

This was so simple and delicious! My husband likes to make it with different flavors and really wowed 'em at the last family get together by serving one that was hot, one that was mellow and one that was sweet. Definitely a keeper for us.

This was super easy and so delicious! I will NEVER buy store bought again!  This is definitely a great base recipe.  I added oil and the entire bean liquid because I like my hummus not so thick.  I also added paprika.  Yum!  This is definitely a keeper!

Really amazing!! It makes a fairly large portion so it was great for snacking for a couple of days. I added a little extra garlic to punch up the taste a little. Don't waste your money on store bought- its so much less expensive and so easy to do!

Loved it! I didn't have the pepper but I'm sure it would have been better with it... I used extra cumin to compensate. Will make again only will add the pepper!

This was very tasty and much healthier than most other hummus recipes.  I just wasn't happy with it until I made it slightly less healthy by adding 2t tahini.  Needed that creamy sesame flavor for my mouth to believe it was hummus.

It was not as creamy as I am accustomed to when I eat hummus.  I suspect that is because it doesn't have the tahini.  I thought the garlic was a bit overpowering but I'm sure it will mellow in the refrigerator overnight so I wouldn't cut down on that just yet.  It is a great base recipe to start with and it is just plain easy when you are pregnant and have these insane hummus cravings like me. : )

I thought this hummus was great! I used red pepper flakes because I didn't have the jalapeno peppers and also added hot sauce and worcesterchire and just a sprinkle of olive oil. This recipe is much healthier than traditional hummus! Update: I've made this many times since my original review. It's easy to make substitutions and this still turns out great! I now like to add a few pickled jalapenos since I never have fresh on hand and I like to add some of the juice from the jar and a few shakes of hot sauce as well. Yum! If I make this for company, I add a few tablespoons of olive oil for a creamier consistency. Everyone seems to like the taste of this dip better than store bought hummus & I love how much cheaper it is too! It's a win, win situation :o)

The texture wasn't ideal. I had to add a lot of extra liquid. Next time I might add some cilantro. I liked the Mexican spicing. I used 2/3 cup dry beans, cooked, instead of the canned beans, and it turned out just fine.

I only used two cloves of garlic, and I still found that the garlic was a bit overpowering.  But the jalapenos were a nice addition.

I used freshly cooked garbanzo beans, so I needed to add salt, and there was no need to add any of the bean liquid. This is a good, non-tahini hummus recipe.

Very easy and kid friendly without the jalapenos. My 5 year old ate it well, but my 17 month old loved it. He dipped crackers in it and ate it by the handful as well. I did not have garlic cloves and substituted 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.

I was finally able to put my new handblender to use!  This was great.  I upped the lemon juice and garlic proportions and it was delish.  I can't wait to make more variations of this...so easy!  Next time I think I'll add some roasted red peppers.

Now I did add  1/3 cup of tahini paste and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.  I also put a little more cumin in, but I'm not sure how much.  I was in a hurry, guests were arriving.  So I added all the ingrediants plus my own and blended in the blender.  Froze it for 10 minutes to chill and served.  Everybody loved it, but now I'll have to try to follow the directions more closely or try to duplicate what I did again.  Thanks for the guidance on what to do though.  I love hummus at restaurants.

I so didn't follow the instructions, but this recipe was a great inspiration. I used a couple of pounds of beans I had cooked and needed to use, about 1/4 cup of tahini I needed to use up, some srirachi sause, a hand-full of home-dried tomatoes, a half a head of garlic, two hatch chilis, some left-over chopped onions & bell peppers (about a quarter cup), a couple tsp. cumin, some kosher salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Yummy!

My first try at making hummus.  I gotta say turned out pretty good.  I made one small change instead of jalepeno's I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice.  This is a great starting point if I feel a bit creative.  Thank you for the recipe.

I had heard of hummus before so decided to try this recipe. Pretty good, but Im definitely no expert. I used my canned jalepenos and added a little peanut butter.

I give it 4 stars only because I didn't deviate a little bit.  I didn't use jalepenos, used 1 tsp cumin (only becuase I barely like cumin), used juice from half a lemom.  Love this recipe.  I don't like tahini.  This is exactly how I want hummus to taste. It have this in the fridge all the time now.

For those who have never made hummus before, you should be aware that this is not a traditional hummus recipe because it does not contain tahini (sesame seed butter).

Fixed it exactly as recipe stated and loved it. However, next time I will cut back on the garlic. We are garlic lovers. I always double, even triple garlic in a recipe so I ignored comments about it being too much garlic. WOW, it was too much garlic even for us. I am looking forward to tweaking and trying some of the variations suggested by others. So glad to finally find a hummus recipe without tahini which brings the fat calories way down!! Thank you :-)

WOW! I have never made hummus before but am on a new eating program. This is one of the few hummus recipes that doesn't call for tahini (whatever that is). I like things spicy and happened to have one lonely jalapeno, so I made this! I used my Ninja and the hummus came out perfectly! This had such a good, spicy flavor! Not too spicy, but just enough. The cumin adds a nice flavor without being too overpowering. I added cracked pepper and a pinch of salt. I will be using this again! Who knew hummus was so easy?

This is a poor man's version of what hummus should taste like. The fats (oil and tahini) have the purpose of binding the garbanzo puree and giving excellent mouthfeel. And the jalapeno is out of place.

So simple and easy. I make this at least once a week. Instead of jalapeno, I use a few dashes of cayenne pepper and serve it with pita chips. Delicious!

As is, this recipe was WAY too garlicky for me, and that's saying a lot. Usually I like a strong garlic flavor!

I love hummus and I have to go on a low-fat low-salt diet so I was very excited about this recipe.  But it just didn't do it for me.  It didn't have the taste or texture that I usually attribute to hummus.  I'd rather use a little tahini and get the more robust flavor.  I'm glad I tried it though since I appear to be in the minority.

This turned out so good. I had never made or even tried hummus, it has a great taste. I will definitely make it again.

This hummus was pretty good. Very simple to make and tasted great with the pita bread that I made. I thought the hard part was getting the garbanzo beans smooth and creamy, and I had to use a lot more liquid than the 1T the recipe called for. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I omitted the liquid from the beans entirely as well as the jalapeno.  I added a little more cumin and 1/4 cup good olive oil.  It turned out great!

Great recipe! And it still tasted like hummus despite the absence of tahini paste. Next time I make it, I'll probably only use two cloves of garlic. Three was a bit too garlicky. I also took out the jalapenos since I'm not a big fan of spicy. I also used about three tablespoons of the reserved bean liquid in addition to the one in the recipe because I like my hummus a bit creamier. I think next time I'll add in some black olives to see how it tastes. Overall, really simple and easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I used picked jalapenos from jar and added some large green olives and few drizzles of olive oil... YUM!  My mom is visiting and loves store bought humus.  She tasted this and ate almost the whole bowl.  Will make again for bunco in 2 weeks.

This hummus is excellent! A great basic recipe to play around with. I added more garlic and some chili oil...so good! And so easy really, just a matter of adding liquid until it reaches your preferred consistency. I eyeballed it, and left the jalapenos out because I didn't have any on hand. I can't wait to try making lemon and dill or roasted red pepper! The low fat aspect and controlled sodium makes it silly for me to buy this in the store. A little olive oil could really "richen" it up!

I think this is an amazing base recipe. I loved the bite the jalapeno gave the hummus, and I appreciated how garlic-y it tasted. If you're not a garlic LOVER, you should probably only use 2 cloves. I added about 7 green olives to my hummus and some olive oil (instead of extra bean juice). Without any changes at all, I think this hummus would still be yummy.

I made this hummus when I found that my tahani had gone bad.  It was good - added olive oil for a smoother consistency and some of the reserved liquid.  Used roasted red pepper, cumin and cayenne pepper for a kick.  Also approx 2 cloves of garlic and a bit of salt with the juice of one lemon.

It was delicious, but for those who are about to make it for the first time, be prepared if your food processor won't work propperly.  I eventually had to use a meat mallet to finish mashing.

Great healthy alternative to normal hummus, which uses olive oil or tahinni.  But for anyone that is counting calories the nutritional info seems a little off.  It probably is more like 30-35 calories per serving.  But all in all it is a good hummus and I will be making it again.

This works OK if you don't have tahini on hand (it's kind of pricey), but don't expect to get that rich hummus-y flavor you know and love without it.

This is a good basic recipe.  I tweaked mine, first adding some olive oil, dried red pepper flakes, only 2 cloves of garlic, chili powder and the key ingredient...fresh cilantro.  The cilantro really did the trick, overall it was a hit.  Next time I will only use one clove of garlic and use some of the bean reserve to make it smoother. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful and easy. I won't be buying the store-bought again. I do add more cumin (about 2-3 tsp), a little salt, paprika, and red-chili pepper flakes (we like the spicy taste). I mash it all with a fork, and rather than use the reserved juice from the garbanzo bean can, I just add a bit of water. Tastes WONDERFUL! Good with raw veggies, in a wrap, pita bread or chapati bread (both from this website), or on crackers. Great recipe. Thanks ELOVINGS!

This Hummus was terrific!! It was super easy to make and also very inexpensive. Next time I make it, I will probably leave out the jalepeno, because even though I removed the seeds, the hummus was just a little too spicy for my liking. Thanks for the recipe, I love it.

If you like traditional hummus then you will fine this recipe merely o.k.  I love true hummus and was so looking forward to making my own instead of spending $7 on an 8 ounce container from my favorite local Greek restaurant.  I tried the recipe and thought it was bland with a very thin texture.  I tried to add a little sesamee oil, more garlic a bit more cumin and some paprika and finally a couple of roasted red peppers.  After all the additions the flavor was simply O.K, at best.  I figure for the cost of the ingredients that I had to add to make this recipe just O.K. I would have only spent $2 more to get authentic, excellent hummus.  Sorry, but I will not try this again.

Good but not great. I made this recipe twice - exactly following the recipe directions, and again with some modifications. After the modifications I'd probably give it more of a 4 star rating, but without it just a 3. First of all, 2 ounces of the jalepeno (with seeds) was MUCH too hot - and I LOVE hot and spicy food: the hotter the Thai/Mexican/Chinese food the better it tastes to me. But the heat from the jalepeno completely overpowered the rest of the ingredients. It was better the second time when I removed 2/3 of the seeds. Also, I found that the addition of a bit of olive oil (1/2 tsp, perhaps?) added some much needed richness to the hummus which was lacking without the tahini. Finally, I added some salt and white pepper and increased the cumin and garlic. Much better. There's still something missing, but I don't know how it could get better without adding tahini at this point. I will make again, especially since I almost always have the ingredients on hand.

I love hummus. This is the first time I've ever made it before, and it didn't turn out nearly as well as I expected given the rating this recipe received. I thought it lacked flavor and texture as written. I ended up adding extra virgin olive oil, some pepper, and since I was in a rush and didn't have tahini on hand, Chipotle Tabasco for an easy way to add some kick and flavor. Reading other reviews, I think leaving out the tahini found in most other recipes was a mistake.

I have never eaten hummus before, so I decided to try it.  This is really good.  I added a touch of sesame oil and a little more lemon juice and I am addicted to this. I did leave out the fresh garlic and put in a tiny bit of garlic powder since I am not a big garlic eater. I tried is on chips, crackers and veggies and it was good with all.  This is going to be a staple in our house.  Thank you.

Man, that was dumb-easy! I had a late-night hankering, but no lemon juice or jalapeño. I used some home made rosemary infused vinegar in lieu of the lemon juice and put a tad bit more garlic in. Mmmmmm.

Quick, quick, quick and easy! I accidentally opened the wrong can of beans and within minutes I had another appetizer ready for dinner tonight. The jalapeno is a must. Delicious.

Did not like this at all. Hummus just insn't hummus without tahini paste. I wish this would have tasted better, as it is much healthier that regular hummus. But, it was very bland and no one liked it at my cookout. Will not try again.

I love this hummus. For one it is so easy to make and the other is that it is low in fat (no oil, no tahini) Now, I am not a hummus expert, but when people tell you to bring this as a dish for events you must be doing something right. My tips: 1) Because I always take to parties or social gatherings, I triple the recipe. 2) I like spicy so when I do make a triple recipe, I use 2 jalapeno peppers and 1 habanero pepper – seeds and ribs removed (depending on the peppers this can get hot – YUM). This is an easy recipe to play around with to adjust to your tastes. 3) Reserve more liquid than listed as it will probably be needed to thin out. Add while processing to get the consistancy you desire. 4) This goes great with oven toasted pita bread (cut just for dipping) and carrots. Great healthy snack.

I have to qualify this by saying that I am not a hummus expert -- I've only had hummus from the store a couple of times. This was my first time making my own and I picked this recipe because I couldn't find tahini. Made it pretty much as indicated, though I substituted red pepper flakes for the jalapenos (didn't have any) and added the tiniest bit of olive oil in hopes of getting the texture creamier. Anyway, it turned out OK, but not great, especially with veggies. Pretty good on tortilla chips, but tortilla chips don't need any help tasting good.

Super easy, and very good.  I used canned jalepenos.  I think fresh jalepenos would make it a bit spicier, but I liked the mild flavor the canned peppers created.   I also added a little olive oil as recommended by others.  Since finding the recipe last week, we have snacked through three batches.  Thank you for a healthy and delicious recipe.

I agree with other reviewers that this is a really good starting point for hummus, and then depending on what you like, you can add or remove ingredients.  I made several changes - I omitted the jalapeno peppers and only used 1.5 cloves of garlic.  I think next time I would use 2 cloves.  I also added 1/4 tsp of parsley, 1/4 tsp of paprika, and a pinch of cayenne for some heat.  I also added a few drops of olive oil, and needed quite a bit of the reserve liquid. I really like this recipe - I'm looking forward to experimenting more with it!

Super yummy, healthy & easy !!!  A real winner.  I used 3 jalapenos, the recommended lemon juice & cumin, 1 tbl of minced garlic, 4 tbl. of garbanzo bean can liquid and 1/2 tsp. of paprika.  I think this is such a tasty & inexpensive alternative to the high fat, expensive store bought hummus.  I used the Magic Bullet to blend the ingredients.

This just didn't have the hummus taste I was looking for - it did have a kick to it that I liked so maybe next time I'll add some jalapeno to my usual hummus recipe (chickpeas, tahini, sesame seeds, garlic, salt, lemon juice)

It was pretty good but it was way too thick.  We had to add a lot more liquid (at least another 1/2 cup) and the garlic flavor was a little overpowering. It was easy to make, though, and a lot cheaper than anything you buy at the store.

This hummus recipe is AWESOME! I don't normally like hummus, but I thought I'd give it one last chance before actually saying I hate it. Now I can't say I hate it! YAY!! Thank you for submitting this recipe!! I didn't add the jalapenos. This is a keeper! I am going to pass this along to all my friends!

This is my favourite diet food.  With no added oil it is very healthy.  I did not add the jalapeño pepper, since I am not crazy for spicy.  I may try it with a roasted red pepper next time, instead.

Good recipe, but it's much more authentic tasting if you leave out the jalapeños, then add a tsp of toasted sesame oil. Yum!

I've made this twice in a week...absolutely love it! I add 2 more ounces of jalapeño and an extra clove of garlic and added hot pepper seeds . I'm not a fan of tahini so I was happy to find this recipe!

Exactly as recipe promises...Easy Hummus. It is simple and tasty. I made mine without the oil, but I did add a little paprika for the top. Delicious!

Awesome recipe!  I feel like it's not "hummus" without the tahini, so I call this my chick pea dip.  I didn't have any jalapenos, so I traded them out for a few squirts of sriracha and I traded the can liquid for olive oil.  AMAZING!

I added a tad bit of olive oil. Super simple to make and had a nice buzz for the tounge :) Not sure if I'm a tahini fan so this fit nice.

I have made this many times. I was surprised how easy and tasty it is. Far better than any store bought brand. I do leave out the peppers because my kids won't eat anything spicy. They both love it. I have served with flatbread, pita chips, carrots and even tortillas. Great snack as well as along with a meal or sandwich spread.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I thought it was just OK.  I didn't like the consistency of it.  I made it in my food processor with the basic blade and it seemed kind of mealy to me.  I also didn't love the flavor of it, but maybe that's just because I'm so used to the taste of tahini.  I found the recipe as is to be somewhat bland.  I then added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. of sun-dried tomato pesto and that improved the taste quite considerably.  I would probably try it again if I was in a pinch for some quick hummus and had garbanzo beans on hand.  I do like that it's lower in calories and fat than regular hummus as it is without oil.

I did as the reviewers suggested and added more reserved liquid.  It was wonderful.  Simple and easy to make.   Definitely a keeper.  I have made this three times already and love it.  Question???  What else can I use hummus for.  I have been using it with veggies but would like to use it more.  What are your suggestions.  Thanks

I didn’t realize it was so easy and cheap to make. Just put a couple of ingredients in the food processer and it is done within a minute. Guess this means I’ve been permanently liberated from buying grocery store hummus. I did change a few things. First, I didn’t use canned juice.I added 2Tbs of tahini oil. I also added a little more water to smooth it out and extra salt to taste. If you are sensitive to warm foods, I would suggest not adding the jalapeño. Other than that, it was pretty good. And did I mention that garbanzo beans are a super food that is also a great source of fiber, protein, and healthy fats.

I started with the ingredients that I had at home (didn't have jalapeno so substituted jarred hot banana peppers) and the result  was very good. Then I added in some sundried tomatoes and it became excellent! I also added juice from the jarred peppers to make it easier to blend. Yum! Am going to eat it with jicama to cut down on the calories from crackers

I've never made hummus before, but I've eaten it plenty of times. This was ok.  I think it really needs tahini and/or oil. Also, I'm a garlic lover and 3 cloves was just too much for 1 can of beans.  Maybe my cloves were really big?  Not sure, but it's a rare things for something to be too garlicky for me.  I didn't have a jalapeño so based on another reviewer I used cayenne and that worked well. I ended up adding some olive oil which helped but it still wasn't great.  I will probably try a different recipe next time.

This is pretty good, but next time I make it I will use only one clove of garlic, as right now I feel like I could light my breath on fire quite easily, lol!  I added some sun-dried tomatoes to mine as per someone's suggestion and it was delicious!  You really don't miss the oil or tahini, and the cumin gives it just the right flavor.  This is definitely good enough for company.  In fact, I'm taking it to my friend's house on Friday night with some dippers and a nice bottle of wine.  Mmmm...!  So simple and elegant and healthy!  Thanks for a good recipe.

This truly was the easiest hummus I've ever made and it tastes great.  I used dehydrated garbanzo beans so I had a lot of cooking liquid to use.  I kept adding it until I had a creamy consistency(probably close to 3/4 cup), and I also added some olive oil for a little more flavor.  I found it also needed salt.  Excellent.  This is my new go to hummus.

I love hummus made with tahini, so was skeptical about this recipe.  This version is surprisingly good! Delicious flavor with much fewer calories.  I like it thick but still needed at least 3 T of bean liquid.  It took too long using blender, so will use my food processor next time.

The recipe as stated was a tad too tangy and really heavy on the lemon in my opinion so I added a bit more garlic, some cayenne pepper and garlic infused olive oil.   I would say this is a great base, but as is, wasn't my cup of tea.

Great recipie!!   It tasted like it had too much lemon juice so I added another can of beans.   Didn't have jalapeno so used cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and a splash of chili flavored sesame oil.    Got rave reveiws from the group.

Very easy, definitely, and nice.  I left out the jalapenos and accidently added too much lemon juice.  Perhaps that's why I had to add more cumin, but either way I think it needs a tad more.  Other than that, like I said, very easy.  Also good and quick.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making my own hummus and it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this from now on instead of buying the expensive stuff at the store.  I must add that I did use a little olive oil based on other recipes as well as adding some roasted red pepper.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Very good, but I would go a little easier on the garlic next time - 2 small/medium cloves would be plenty. I used a little bit of olive oil to make it smoother, and I would recommend this. I used pickled jalapenos instead of fresh, which made it quite spicy.

This was addicting. I followed exactly. I used a combination of extra virgin olive oil and reserved liquid to smooth the hummus out. I also added some salt and pepper. Served with homemade pita chips.

I used this recipe to save a different hummus recipe that I wasn't fond of.  Because of that, I had more cumin than this recipe called for and some olive oil, but the EVOO won't affect the taste.  There was too much lemon juice, imo.  I did not use jalapenos since I don't like spice, but other than that it was a good recipe.

I just made this for the first time and found it a little bland. I did add some extra reserve liquid and about a T of olive oil to make it fluffier. To punch it up a bit I chopped some roasted red peppers to garnish the top. Super easy and I will probably make it again but I was not blown away.

Like another reviewer, I love garlic, but this was way too much.  I will definitely make it again but go with 2 cloves so the garlic is there but more muted.  I also had to add more bean liquid and olive oil to make it a smooth consistency. I do NOT like heat, so I left out the jalapenos. Definitely yummy.

Very good! I love the pure taste of the chickpeas without the need for oil. It is also low-fat! It is now a staple in my refrigerator and so much cheaper/tastes better than store bought.

Delicious! First time hummus maker. Spicy and garlicky.

Additional ingredients added / recipe modified:
1) 2 Tbs Olive Oil (would add more next time);
2) 5 Spearment Leaves (would add 8-10 next time);
3) Dash of Tamari;
4) 1/2 a jalapeno (reduce to 1/3 next time);
5) Ground Pepper;
6) Reduced garbanzo liquid to 1 Tbs;
7) Add more liquid next time (water, oil);

I was trying to find a way to make the store-bought hummus I love into a lower-fat version, so I like that this recipe doesn't use olive oil. I left out the jalapeno. It definitely tasted like something was missing and a little bland, so I added salt to taste and a teaspoon of sesame seed oil. This hummus isn't as good as store bought or restaurant made, but I think it will be a decent cheaper, lower-fat replacement.

Added rosemary and sun dried tomatoes and 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. I figure it still is better for you even with the added oil. This is a good base recipe for a healthier hummus.

I also added some green onion & extra garlic- but the tahini (for me anyway) was surely missed. The best part is the ease of this recipe. It was good, not great- but definitely worth making if you're in a pinch!

I have only tasted hummus a couple times and have certainly never made it, but was looking for a healthier dip for veggies.  I didn't have jalepenos and used one tablespoon of the reserved liquid plus almost 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.  It tastes great and was very easy.  Will definitely be making again

Honestly, I've never had hummus before so I'm not sure how it is supposed to taste but I had a bunch of garbanzo beans so decided to try this recipie. I really like it. I will only put in two cloves of garlic next time and I may try adding the pain yogert like an earlier reviewer did but I will make it again.

Good base but wasn't creamy enough even after adding about 3 tbsp of the liquid. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add liquid till it is the consistency I like.  I might try adding some plain yogurt as another reviewer suggested, as I felt it was missing a slight dairy taste of some kind.  Thanks for sharing!

The recipe lacks Tahini sauce. It's the key ingredient if you're trying to make an authentic middle eastern dip.

You'll need 3 table spoons of tahini.

This is a great idea.  I don't use the jalapeno because I usually don't have any, but I add extra cumin and some chili powder.  It is different from hummus with tahini, but it makes for a refreshing (and lighter) change.

Made this recipe for lunch today along with a recipe for pita chips from this site.  Fantastic!  Just the right amount of heat with the jalapenos (Though I added a few more than the recipe called for).  I did use 2 tbsp. of the leftover garbonzo bean fluid instead of one.

Great!

I thought this was good, but not perfect.  I don't know what kind of jalapenos she was using..canned or real, but I only put one pepper in mine.  It was still pretty hot.  Next time I will use only 1.5 medium cloves of garlic and put in at least a tbsp of olive oil.  I still liked it though, but I think it tastes better on pita chips than on real pita bread.

MMM! This was my first time making hummus, just realized that I love it!

I left out the cumin and jalapeno, added a touch of olive oil, salt and fresh italian parsley YUM YUM! I think next time i'll omit the lemon juice. I prefer to squeeze it on top of whatever Im eating.

Awesome!  I got a food processor for Christmas and have been trying to use it as much as possible, so I decided that I'd try making my own hummus for once.  I'll definitely do it again!  I didn't have any jalapenos, but then I'm not much of a jalapeno person anyway.  My fiance is going to want this all the time, and it's easy enough that he can learn to make it too.

This was great - so quick and easy! We left out the jalepenos and will likely add more of the bean juice or EVOO next time.  Thanks for sharing!
