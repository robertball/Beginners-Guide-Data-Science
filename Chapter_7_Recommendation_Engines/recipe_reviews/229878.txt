Made this for my gluten intolerant Hubby. Good taste! A little dense, don't know if that is normal or not, but still tastes good! I had two pieces. I made it in my bread maker, it has a GF setting. I used GF all purpose flour that already had Xanthum gum in it, so I just added up all the flours and put that many cups of my all purpose in. I also used cocont oil in place of the vegetable oil.

I couldn't believe it but this bread really is great no matter how you slice it.  I've made numbers of recipes over the years and haven't found one like this.  I've made three loaves of this recipe so far and each has been delicious.  The first attempt was by the book, so-to-speak, except I use fresh yeast (between 18-20 grams) because dry yeast is not available to me and white rice flour.  Second attempt I subbed half white half brown rice for the rice flour but maintained the other types of flours/starches and topped with buckwheat, brown rice and millet flakes.  Third attempt (the one in my picture) 1/2 white and 1/2 brown as well as tapioca for corn starch and guar gum (equivalent doses) for the xanthan (ran out of a few things).  In the second and third attempt I used 2 TBSP of low fat powdered milk and it has a fluffier texture to it and tossed some sesame seeds on top.  Will continue to use this third recipe.  Also, I never used an electric mixer.  All done by hand, much easier I think.  For those who weigh:  181 grams rice flour (my brown and white rice flours weigh about the same)+70 grams sorghum+75grams potato starch+63 grams tapioca.  The conversions on this site seem to go by volume not weight.  Definitely a keeper for basic bread recipe.  Toasted, sandwiches or just plain, simply a winner!  Thanks to Christy.

This gluten free recipe for white bread is simply delicious. This was the first "yeast" recipe for gluten free bread that I have made. Found it to be simple and straight forward.  The only change was using brown rice flour since I had no white rice flour. I stronly suggest the use of a stand mixer with the bread blade since gluten free dough is much more sticky than traditional yeast bread doughs. 
The bread holds up very well for sandwiches and makes a wonderful toast for breakfast. I like very much!

I've been gluten free for close to two years now. I've always bought Udi's bread, which is ok, but not anything really great. I then bought bread that was $8 a loaf. It felt wet and it was just gross. So this was my first attempt ever making Gluten Free bread because I've been trying to get a feel for baking again.  Well, I can tell you this recipe is worth a shot. Most people who have celiac are allergic to soy and diary, so this was nice because I didn't have to try and sub anything. I made this bread and I only added baking powder, 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp. My daughter and I (GF) thought this was great and so good. It doesn't look like normal bread dough, it has a very wet look. Don't mess with it. I'll never buy bread again.

I made this bread yesterday for a friend who is gluten intolerant.  She loved it and said it tasted very good.  I followed the recipe exactly using the white rice flour, I am going to try with brown rice flour per her request next time.

This bread is the best I've found. I cut it into slices as soon as cool. I wrap a few together in plastic wrap and put each bundle together in gallon ziplock bag. These all go in freezer.  The best toast!!!   Ive made grilled cheese, french toast, and sandwiches and its great. Here i thought I had to give up bread!!!  : )  i use a gluten free baking flour instead of all the ones stated. Much more easy. Just 3 cups of gluten free baking flour!

We went gluten free a week ago (due to Celiac disease). We have eaten better and had more delicious food than we have ever had (so far all from Allrecipes.com). I have already made this bread 3 times. It is AWESOME! I have found it works better using my 9 cup food processor than a mixer. Also, warming the oven (100 degrees and then shutting the oven off) and leaving the bread in the oven for an hour makes it rise much better.

Just made this recipe only I used Flaxseed meal instead of Xanthan gum, and Tapioca flour instead of Sorghum flour.  I was scared at how runny the dough seemed but remembered reading about gluten free dough looking like this. It turned out great!  I am very impressed since this was my first attempt at making homemade gluten free bread.  Thank you!

I have been using this recipe for several months now. I work in a pizza restaurant and have tried several different gluten free crusts. After many trial and error. I decided to use this recipe and make a hand tossed pizza crust and the result was amazing.

My 8 y/o daughter has Celiac Disease, newly diagnosed. She has been so easy to please, but school lunch has been very bland. This bread was easy and delicious! I followed it exactly with the exception of using fast rising yeast just shy of a TBS because that was all I had, and using a slightly smaller loaf pan to make up for the lack of yeast. It came out GREAT! Sliced and froze individual slices wrapped in wax paper. ****I just made it for about the 20th time and substituted tapioca flour for the sorghum (only because I was almost out) and it resulted in an even softer, spongier slice :D

This was a hit for the whole family, especially my newly gluten free 6 year old son. He lives for a PB&J, and I really thought I was going to be forced to pay $5 a loaf for the bread mix in the GF section. I made it into into a mini loaf pan, that makes 8 little loaves (like muffins). I can cut each lengthwise into four slices, and he takes 2 little PB&J sandwiches to school now. It cost me about $2.25 to make the 8 tiny loaves, which is pretty close to what I paid before for WW sandwich bread.

Really great tasting bread! My hubby is GF and he loved as it tastes like "normal" bread. Tried in the bread machine - works really well! I just mixed all the dry ingredients together before putting them in the machine. Thanks!

This was wonderful! We have only been GF for 3 weeks, but REALLY missed bread the most. We found it a little salty, but our taste buds have not really adjusted to more healthy, lower suger options yet. Next loaf, I am going to cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, and add 1 more Tbsp of sugar to the dry ingredients. (not the yeast water) for maybe a little sweeter taste. I got lucky and found this recipe after only two other disastrous ones that went to the  4 doggies. Thank you!

This bread tastes great! I used Flaxseed meal instead of Xanthan gum, and Tapioca flour instead of Sorghum flour. This was my first attempt at making homemade gluten free bread and it turned out great. I did put a cookie sheet under the loaf pan, and I am glad I did since it spilled over.

This bread came out absolutely delicious!  Here's what I did - I used Bobs Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour, which contains a mix of flours from potatoes,  sorghum, tapioca, garbanzo and fava beans.  I added up all the measurements of the different flour ingredients and used that much of the Bobs flour, and everything else exactly the same - I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks so much!

I made this today. First try for gluten free bread.  I thought it was great.  The only change I made was coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. I did as one reviewer suggested and put my oven on warm for a few minutes and than shut it off.  When the dough was just over the top of the bread pan (I used a 10"x6" loaf pan) in abt 1 hr. I than left the pan in the oven and increased the temp to 375.  Once it hit that temp, I timed it for 25 minutes.  It is a dense bread, but did not come out doughy.  Made it for me due to my gluten sensitivity but my husband has been eating it all!  Will definitely make again.  Would love to know if this can be doubled.  Anyone try?

A little piece of heaven is in this recipe.  It's my first attempt at making gluten-free bread, so I didn't know what to expect.  It was moist, rose beautifully, and tasted sooo good!  I am very new to all this, so I somewhat in doubt substituted the potato starch with tapioca starch as I had mistakenly bought potato flour, and the result was beyond good.  Does anyone know if this recipe can be doubled/tripled?  I have heard some gluten-free recipes don't get good results if multiplied.

I made this bread several days ago and WOW! As much as I LOVE to bake, I've never ventured into baking with yeast (probably because I don't ever remember my mother making anything with it), it made me nervous so for years I had used a bread machine. The bread machine was given away 2yrs ago when I down-sized and moved to a place with nil-to-none counter space. 
Several months ago I went wheat-free and one of the things I missed a lot was bread (It just wasn't worth $5+ to buy a loaf). I came across this recipe about a month ago and it sounded pretty simple so I saved it and vowed to try it after the holidays. I'm thrilled that I did!! It is so easy to make. It slices well, toasts well, and freezes well! I sliced the whole loaf the day after I made it and but it in a freezer bag and stuck it in the freezer. I was afraid it would mold faster than I/we would eat it; my teens aren't as madly in love with it as me but are thankful to have the option of bread again. It freezes well, I just take it out by the slice and either toast it or just let it sit for about 10min to thaw.
The consistency is different than regular bread because the gluten isn't there but it IS good! I made it exactly as written. It's a batter bread as opposed to a dough bread, which is what makes it soooo easy!!!

This has the look and texture of the gluten free breads I have tasted, such as Udi's brand. It is just slightly more dense. For being homemade. I guess, I just expected something so much better. A year or so ago I decided to test gluten or wheat free baked goods to see how they would turn out. I found that despite the wheat not being included they still had tons of starch, eggs, butter, and sugar. Sometimes, at rates much higher than regular white or whole grain bread. This bread was no exception. It was super easy to make, as no hand kneading or shaping is needed. Though like most gluten free breads, I find it very rich and almost too sweet tasting. Definitely not like what I know as regular sandwich bread. This one was so sweet it almost reminded me of a mix between bread and a low sugar pound cake or as another reviewer put it closer to a very sweet "beer bread." I thought the amount of sugar seemed excessive. I liked the crunch it had. However, I think that was due to blending rice in my Vitamix grain container to make rice flour. I was just trying to use up sorghum flour, potato starch, and some xanthum gum. I bought these ingredients solely to test gluten free recipes as I only seem to see these ingredients in them and they do have a shelf life. I would definitely not recommend this recipe to someone that eats regular wheat bread, but possibly to someone gluten or wheat intolerant to save some money. Udis & similar brands run about $5.00 a loaf. I got 18 slices total.

This is a great base recipe for GF bread.  I do wish the author had shared some more important info: 1) all ingredients should be room temperature.  This is always true for yeast-based baking!  2) Mix all your dry ingredients together, then all your non-yeast wet ingredients together instead of trying to mix everything at once.  You'll get better results, promise.  3) Since all ovens are different and it's hard to tell when GF bread is done, from what research I could find online, most GF breads should be baked to ~200-220 degrees F.  I pulled mine out at 210 and it's perfect.  

SO, it's great!  To be fair, I was an avid baker before developing food sensitivities that forced me into a low FODMAP lifestyle, so I know what regular home baked bread is like.  It's dense.  This recipe, like all other home baked breads, is dense.  But it's delicious!  I had to use a rice-free GF flour blend (thank you, Gluten Free Gigi!), which I swapped out for all the other flours/ starches (~3 cups total, sorry I don't know the weight).  I also used 1 tsp of plain gelatin instead of Xantham since I didn't have any (rule of thumb = 1 tsp for 2.5 cups GF flour).  The "dough" was VERY liquidy but rose and baked as expected.

I checked the bread at 25 minutes and it was only about 140F so I continued, checking every few minutes, for a total of about 40 minutes until it reached 210.  I baked mine in a glass dish so let it cool for a few before moving to the rack.  After letting it cool for a couple

Delicious! Even my very picky daughter loved it. The texture is wonderful! It's as close to traditional bread as I've had since I going gluten free. I found the first loaf I made to be too salty and it had a slight aftertaste, so I modified it a bit. I used 1 Tablespoon of sugar and 2 Tablespoons of honey, which gave it a better flavor. I also reduced the salt slightly to only 1 teaspoon. I baked it in the bread machine using the express bake setting for a 1.5 pound loaf. That was too dense and moist(but still delicious), so next time I'll try the 2 pound setting.

I can't thank you enough. Tired of paying almost $7 a loaf for GF bread for my stepdaughter. The GF transition was hard at first, but starting to branch out and make my own flour mixes and baked goods since I baked before, but never GF. She says this is wonderful and like 'real bread'. I made it as is with no substitutions. I am so excited - thank you again!

Searched for gluten free bread recipe and this is a keeper! Very quick and easy to make.  Like the taste.  Makes good sandwich bread and is also good toasted.  Freezes well.

I am currently glutting myself on a hot, moist loaf of gluten free bread and I am so happy, I might even cry a bit. I am a bread lover who had to give up gluten about 9 months ago and the store bought stuff is LAME. This recipe is FANTASTIC. I only made two changes: I had to sub arrowroot powder for the corn starch (corn intolerance) and used 3 cups of a g-free blend instead of the three different flours.

I'm baking gluten free for my sister and after ADDing another EGG to this recipe she says, it's not falling apart on her anymore. (Homemade gluten free breads seem to do that a lot.) Even her four-year-old son stopped complaining!

Absolutely love this recipe.  Soft, spongy, and a tastes like regular white wheat bread.  We are no longer going to buy the expensive gluten free breads from the store, this tastes much better. I imagine you can add other grains to suit your tastes.

I've been searching high and low for a good GF white yeast bread, and..... this is it!!!!! It produces a nice large 9x5 loaf which most GF breads are so small.  My kids can eat a "regular style" sandwich again!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it will be treasured by my growing family of 8.  Also, I followed the recipe exactly and changed absolutely nothing....it's perfect the way it is.

This reminds me more of beer bread than a sandwich bread.  Mine did not rise too well. (I did proof my yeast as directed)I think it was just too moist so next time I will use less water.  I may even sub some almond milk for the at least half of the water.  That being said, I thought the taste was pretty good.  It does however have that gf grainy texture.  But beggar's can't be choosers and this is certainly better than that horrible, crumbly frozen bread from the big chain stores.

Absolutely delicious!! Great gluten free texture, waaaay better than store bought breads. I dare say it's better than traditional white bread! I've used it in sandwiches and toast. Toast is my favorite, it crisps on the outside and stays soft on the inside. They key is making sure you activate the yeast right! Google activating yeast if you're a newbie to it, it helped me a lot! I swapped out potato starch for tapioca for allergies and it came out fabulous! My bread rose over the top of the pan.

This was my 4th attempt at a gluten-free bread recipe since my celiac diagnosis a year ago.  This is the BEST I have made.  It turned out soft, fluffy, stayed at its proofing height, and tastes great.  Slices easily.  Crust is golden brown all the way around.  Since it doesn't specify what kind of rice flour to use, I used white rice flour.  To proof it, I pre-heated the oven to 200 while I was making the bread.  Then turned off the warm oven and put the bread in to rise for 30 minutes.  Then I removed the pan from the oven and set it back to preheat to 365 with the bread on the stove top to continue its proofing.  I left it there for another 30 minutes at which point it had more than doubled in size.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 365, cooled it for 5 minutes on a rack, and then removed the bread from the pan and let it finish cooling on its side.  I didn't need to put a foil tent over the bread while it was baking.  It did great without any extra help.  GREAT RECIPE!  I will make it again and again.  Thank you!

Let me begin by saying that I know GF bread making is the most challenging baking one does gluten free. I am very successful with GF baking, but have yet to find a good GF bread.

What I do NOT like about the bread made from this recipe is -
1) taste. (whole) eggs change the flavor from 'bread' to more cake like. I may try this again using only the egg whites.
2) texture. This recipe - while easy and quick to make - produces a more cake like type of texture that reminds me of pound cake more than bread.

I have been able to produce a more 'chewy' texture using modified tapioca flour (Expandex brand). However the taste isn't wonderful (though tempered nicely by vinegar!) and the bread dries out with 'crust' flaking within a day and after freezing too.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated - only addition was King Arthur's cake enhancer. It came out beautifully with the density of a Arnold's or a Pepperidge Farm bread. However, I would not consider it a pure replacement for white bread. The buttermilk gave it a bit of a tang - almost a hint of a sourdough flavor. This would work extremely well with deli meats but not something you would want for a PB&J.

This is a wonderful recipe! I substitute oatmeal flour for the sorghum flour, otherwise I follow it to the letter. I have made it over and over again and it always comes out great. Rises higher than most gluten-free breads and is probably the closest that I have found to "real" loaf of bread.  Freezes well too.

I've been GF for 10 years and have tried many, many different recipes, this is the BEST scratch recipe I have ever made. The bread is soft, tastes great, and is not too heavy. I did use tapioca flour instead of corn starch because I didn't have any corn starch.

This bread recipe is great. I altered it a bit, as I had Brown Rice Flour and replaced the Sorghum Flour with Garbonzo Bean Flour. But overall, this recipe turned out fantastic. Going to make more today.

Thank you so much Christy E. This is without a doubt the best GF bread I've ever made.  I was skeptical when making it because it was one very wet dough that I put into the loaf pan but it came out way better than I ever expected.  I made only one adjustment to the recipe. I used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1 cup water instead of all water. 
This bread is dense but soft and moist but not doughy at all. It's not crumbly on the inside yet it has a very nice crumb crust like wheat bread on the outside. Very nice and my family loved it.
I will be using this recipe as my 'go to' from now on.

Using my own flour blend, 2 white rice, 1 each potato starch, tapioca flour, I found this recipe to be the best! ( I avoid sorghum..). I also use butter and coconut oil for fats. Add the juice and rind of half a lemon.  Scooping the batter into 17 greased english muffin rings...or large canning jar rings, smoothing the batter with dampened fingers, allowing them to rise about an hour, and baking 20 minutes at 375* and another 10 at 350, they are incredible!!! Splitting them after cooking, they provide the best container for sandwiches, rolls, and even a base for strawberry shortcakes! Best toasted, they finally provide a superior bread base for any meal!

Really, really yummy - doesn't taste gluten free.  I've made it twice now and will make it many more times.  My issue with it is that it doesn't rise well - it makes a very dense loaf.  It may be the fault of the Minnesota winter and not the recipe.  Give this a try!!

I make this bread twice a week. My whole family loves it. It only stays fresh for about three days, then makes an awesome French toast. The fresher the yeast the faster the proof and rise.

I've tried several gluten free bread recipes and this one has been the best so far. It's basically fool proof if you follow the recipe as written. I was a little confused at first because the dough mixes almost like a cake in the mixer, but don't worry about over mixing, it will turn out beautifully. This one is a keeper...and what a relief from paying $8 a loaf in the stores!

I made one small change, a trick I learned baking regular bread. I let the oven preheat with the loaf in the oven and added five minutes to baking time. It gives a slight boost to the rise and creates a lighter texture. Excellent recipe. Too bad I can't share a photo. My wife, the celiac, said it is better than the store bought .

Turns out more like pound cake than bread.  Maybe too much water or oil.  Bread deflated after coming out of oven.

I would give full stars but I changed somethings which were to suit our dietary needs. I changed the cornstarch to arrowroot and used flax eggs instead. It worked out well and didn't fall apart like some breads do so that was nice. Good toasted or not toasted. Thanks for a base recipe!

I tried this recipe twice, to the letter, and my bread turned out horrible. It was holey and lumpy, not a nice texture at all, and overall looked like a child did it. 
I'm sure it was something I did wrong.  Any ideas?

This was so easy to make.  It sliced well and tasted wonderful until I got to the center of the loaf and found it was raw.  The entire center was dough!   I will try it again with a lower oven temperature so that it bakes more slowly.

Super easy recipe to follow and delicious bread! Mine did take closer to 40 minutes to bake, but I think this will be out staple gluten free bread. Much better than anything you can get in the store!

This bread is by far the best I have found, and SO easy. I actually used oat flour this time instead of sorghum and I think it was even better. My daughter liked it better.

I made this recipe only I substituted Bob’s red mill 1:1 gluten free baking flour in place of all the other flours in this recipe. I kept the same measurements and added them all together except for the corn starch. I happened to have that on hand. It smells lovely and came out nicely browned in 25 mins! I do think I should of let it rise a bit more though because the top ended up really flat for me.  It is dense as others have mentioned but has really lovely air pockets like you get with wheat bread. I would make this again!

Will definitely make again. My wife and cousin are gluten intolerant. It was delicious. 
Only changes were pre-made gluten free flour, and I made the bread like I would any other white bread. That is to say I added the eggs beaten and salt to the sponge then the flour. 
Thanks for sharing!

This is the second gluten free recipe I tried after being tasked with baking bread for my gluten sensitive nephew. I tested my expired yeast in 1/2 cup of water with 1 tsp of sugar to make sure it’s still useful, and went through to follow the recipe using flaxseed meal instead of xanthum gum, and holding off the topping up of water. Since the first recipe I tried the dough turned out too watery and the bread collapse, I was a little apprehensive when the dough was already more liquid than pictures I’ve seen of gluten free dough. So I didn’t top up the water to the 1 and 1/4 cup stated in the recipe. Final was only 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp in the flaxseed slurry. The bread doubled just fine and baked up nicely without collapsing. However I found it a little dense and crumbly. Not sure whether it’s meant to be like that, or is it due to my reduced water?

Wow! I don't have to buy a tiny loaf of gluten-free bread for $5 anymore. I've never made any type of bread before, so I was happy to how easy this recipe was to make.  I've had a bag of anthem gum for a while. I don't want to waste it, so I am trying different recipes that use it.  I have to master smoothing out the dough before baking. Otherwise, it doesn't look too good, but it tastes great!.

This recipe is great! It uses the usual gluten free ingredients that every celiac sufferer should have available. Easy to modify with grain additions like sunflower seeds, flax seeds and gluten free rolled oats. Tasted it warm from the oven and it was wonderful!

Don't need to be gluten free, but have family coming, and I am trying to provide a gluten free meal for those requiring it.  Turned this recipe into buns instead of the loaf.  They taste like Yorkshire pudding, look like muffins...good with turkey or pb&j.  Gorgeous products!

This recipe turned out better than I expected. I did make a few substitutions.

I didn't have sorghum flour, so I used buckwheat flour. 
I substituted white rice flour with brown rice flour.

If you're using a stand mixer, use the beater bar to mix the ingredients. I used the whisk, and had a devil of a time getting the dough out of the tines. It was about as much fun as sun-bathing of Mars.

My partner is gluten intolerant. The store bought gluten free bread leaves much to be desired. The texture of the bread from this recipe is the best ever, even by plain white bread standards. The recipe calls for 3 tsp. of sugar. It will make the bread taste a little sweeter than ordinary bread. Next time I'll use only 1.5 tsp. 

The bread recipe is magnificent. Even with substitutions, it still turned out mighty good. However, follow the quantities for each ingredient.

I tried this for my sister who switched to a gluten free diet. Added another egg, because she says it's a too crumbly otherwise. Now she can use it for anything. I'm working on opening a bakery and this is the one thing most people get to know me through.

I made this gluten free bread today for the first time after reading all the reviews on this recipe and I must say this is a keeper for my notebook of saved recipes. I will definitely be making this bread often. It is easy to make and I did not change anything from the original recipe. Some of you made a few ingredient changes for various reasons and I am going to try some of those but I must say the original came out excellent. The crust was light brown as I like, the texture was  slightly denser than wheat bread but not that noticeable and the taste was very close to wheat bread. I've tried a number of recipes looking for that really great one as a substitute for wheat bread that my granddaughters will like and eat since one of them was recently diagnosed with Celiac. It's a big change for a nine year old to adjust to gluten free foods from now on. We are slowly getting there although good gluten free bread seems to be the one thing most people are looking for. I just bought a new Zo. Virtuoso bread machine with gluten free settings and I will be curious to see how this recipe works out in that. As I've said, I will try some of the tweeks I've read here but this is definitely a keeper.

This is hands down my most favourite gf bread ever!!!! This is a basic simple recipe that I've fallen in love with.  Easy to substitute ingredients if you may not have something in your cupboard.  Now the most important part for me is, it's not dry and doesn't feel like it's sucking all the moisture from your body while you try to choke it down.  You can easily eat without toasting!!!

I made this today , first time doing gluten free.  The bread raised beautifully, nice and light and fluffy.  The only thing is that it had a yellow colour and had a strange after taste.  Any ideas on the taste.

Followed it exactly! I did however use this recipe to make dinner rolls  I tweaked it a tiny bit. 1 cup sorghum 1 cup rice 1/2 cup potatoe flour 1/2 cup corn starch.  I let the dough rise in the mixing bowl and then put the batter in a muffin pan and let it rise again. Baked for 18 minutes and they were awesome!

Best gluten free bread I've ever tasted! It's also extremely easy to make. I'll never buy it in the stores again!

My first time making a gluten free bread.  I put my mixer on high for 30 seconds once the batter came together to put more air in the batter.  Scooped out 16 rolls and baked about 20 minutes.  The texture was like cheddar bay biscuits at Red Lobster but without the cheddar and the butter.  Very light and fluffy.  They were a little on the sweet side so I wonder how this batter would do in the waffle maker.   I intend to pre-measure out the dry ingrediants into a ziploc bag to have ready to go mix to make bread, rolls or pizza.

I just took it out of the oven and tried it. It is so good! It is heavy compared to a typical bread. I made 2 small loaves because I don't have a 9x5 pan. I used parchment paper so I don't have to grease the pans. I hope my picky child eats it :-)

It was incredibly dense - almost the consistency of biscuits.

I make bread for my little grandson who must eat Gluten Free. It's hard to tell it's gluten free, the taste is good. I've tried many other recipes and this is one of the best if not the best. I wrap each piece separately with plastic wrap and then but all the slices into a freezer bag so his mom can freeze them and take out at will. Now he enjoys PBJ's and grilled cheese like the rest of the kids.

I made this recipe today just as it was written an I am really happy with it. I have been gluten free for a few months now and was really frustrated with the dry cardboard texture of GF breads sold in stores. They all toast ok but not for a sandwich. I will make this again!! next time add some garlic/onion salt for a twist. wonder how it would hold up for buns or in english muffin rings...

This has a pleasant flavor and good consistency on the first day to day and a half. It gets crumbly as it gets to the second day, but it still tastes good. Everyone enjoyed it, even though only one of us is celiac.
