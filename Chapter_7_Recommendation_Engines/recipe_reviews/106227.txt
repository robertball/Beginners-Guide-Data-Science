I did not have sake, nor the salad dressing. I simply omitted these two ingredients. Based on the review, I also reduce the water, to make sure that the sauce is not too watery. 

I also did not poach the fish in advance, because salmon usually cooks very fast in the oven. 

The taste is awesome. It gives a perfect balance. I love this recipe and would definitely make it again.

What a fantastic and different way to do salmon!  The only change I made was I didn't have prepared soy-ginger dressing, so I mashed up some sushi ginger in 3tbsp of soy sauce.  It was great!  The only thing I'll do different next time is not poach the salmon beforehand.  Salmon cooks quickly enough in the oven without the added step of poaching.  A keeper for sure!

Grilled the salmon instead of bake/broil.  Instead of the salad dressing I used a generous splash of light soy, fresh ground ginger, garlic, some mirin instead of sake, a bit of rice wine vineager and a squeeze of lime.  I used maybe a quarter cup of miso since it seemed like it would be too salty with more.  I also used honey instead of brown sugar.  Took half of the ingredients mixed for a marinade, then added the rest to sauteed onions, baby garlic, scallions, snow peas and wheat pasta as a sauce.  Overall a little salty but very tasty.

Good recipe but needs some adjusting for my taste. Way too much miso, it overwhelmed everything including the salmon. I would also either add more Sake or ignore it all together, the amount in the recipe isn't noticeable. Also, I have no idea where to find soy-ginger salad dressing. It wasn't at the specialty store, it wasn't at the grocery store, So I just added 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1 tsp fresh ginger.   I'll try it again with these changes.

This was sooo good! I didn't have sake in the house, and I substituted honey for brown sugar. It was a big hit!!!

This sauce has a wonderful flavour! I followed the ingredients exactly, but didn't poach the salmon and left the skin on while I was baking it. I found that the sauce was too runny to be a spread but a bit too thick to be a good glaze - it might have been the salad dressing I used (Jesse's Ginger Salad Dressing on this site - I kept the carrots which added nice flavour), or maybe next time I won't add the water so I can get a thicker spread of the sauce on the salmon. I served the salmon with cous cous with carrots and currents and with steamed broccoli over which I poured some extra sauce from the pan - delish! I am definitely going to try it out on chicken and maybe beef, too!

This was delicious! I didn't have sake and it still came out great. Poaching the fish first gave it a nice, delicate texture. Next time I will cut down on the amount of sauce though because I had a lot left over.

This is a 5 PLUS meal. VERY VERY YUMMY! Very easy to put together and a very quick cook. My husband said he could eat this every day. My step father whom is Japenese LOVED it. I think he licked his plate clean :) LOL! Thank you so much for sharing...

Mine yielded waaaaay too much sauce (like twice as much) and it was really salty. However, I'm inclined to blame the miso paste that I bought since no one else complained about it.

My initial attempt at this recipe was using boneless skinless chicken breast, as the salmon had gone bad before i got to use it. We didn't have quite enough miso paste and did not have sake, so we used mirin instead. I made the soy ginger salad dressing from a recipe i found here and we just figured we'd wing it. It was wonderful!! I think it will be one of our new favorites. The chicken turned out extremely moist, and the sauce was perfect. We tossed some broccoli into the pan and roasted that in the sauce as well. I can't wait to try the sauce on steak on the grill!

This was awesome. I didn't want to use beer so I used 1/2 cup of broth and 1/2 cup of sake! I put the marinade on chicken and tofu and it was great!

Wow!  My husband who doesn't usually care much for salmon, raved about this dish last night!  I'll be making more of this.  I used two small salmon steaks, halved the sauce recipe, and marinated the steaks.  Then I stuck them whole pan - steaks and sauce, into the oven for about 25 minutes.  Didn't try broiling, but the tender steaks simmered in the sauce beautifully and they were so tender and delicious!  Will be making this again!

The fish tasted like vinegar!  We double checked the amount, and it was correct: 3 tablespoons.  We couldn't even eat it.

Delish! I didn't have sake or seasoned vinegar on hand, so I subsituted Chinese rice cooking wine and a dark vinegar. My family loved it, but it was a tad dry for my taste. Next time, I'll probably put it straight into the oven, rather than poaching it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made one substitution.  Because Trader Joe's didn't carry miso paste, I used a packet of instant Miso soup powder and omitted the water in the recipe.  Delicious.

Due to a slight miscalculation, I ended up making the marinade, and then brushing it on the salmon in order to grill it. We grilled a 1.5 lb salmon on medium for about 25-30 mins, brushing on more marinade every 5 mins or so. The result was incredible. I only wish I had been able to have more sauce (maybe next time)! I paired this with a home made mango salsa, and it was suddenly like I was at a restaurant! Absolutely perfect and delicious. If you do choose to grill it though, definitely lessen the recipe....I had so much marinade left over! What a waste!

Ok, so I didn't follow this exactly (sorry!) but it's a recipe that you can play with I think. My husband said it was "exceptional"... and then "why eat out??" :)
I quartered the miso (per other suggestions), halved the brown sugar and just added powdered ginger since I didn't have the salad dressing and thought adding more soy sauce would make it way too salty. I served it with green beans and white rice. Delicious!

LOVED this!  Everyone wanted seconds.  The thickness of the miso helped the flavoring stick so it was absorbed into the salmon.  Didn’t have sake, and it still tasted great.  A keeper recipe.  Thank you!

Way way way way way way too much miso paste. I didn't have sake so I subbed in wine, didn't have rice vinegar so used apple cider, and didn't have soy-ginger dressing or a sub. Still, after some tweaking it came out pretty good. Going to continue tweaking until I get it right. The flavors are all right but the ratio needs some work.

My wife and I loved it! Instead of miso, however, we used about 3/4 cup Doenjang, which is like Japanese miso's Korean cousin that has a stronger taste to it. Turned out great. We also did not have the ginger salad dressing and used white wine for cooking instead of sake. Did not poach salmon beforehand.

pretty good tasting. my picture did not turn out anything like the others . use less water u want the sauce thick to sit on the fish instead of letting it run down sides. I left out sake and tasted great.

So from reading all the reviews, I'm assuming this recipe is bad. Nobody seems to have made it as written...so why did people rate it so high? Let's try to keep the reviews and star ratings honest and accurate.

Hi, this is overall a very good recipe, the sauce came out delicious, and I think most of this recipe is the sauce.I don't know that I would agree that this is that "easy",it's certainly not hard,but there are a lot of ingredients to measure out,and most of these items are not things I had on hand (e.g. miso paste,seasoned rice vinegar, sake,soy-ginger salad dressing...Pay careful note to the type of vinegar,one review said it came out too vinegary,don't use the wrong vinegar, there is apparently quite a difference in taste depending on the type.) Luckily I pretty much found all of these ingredients at Whole Foods, with the exception of the soy-ginger dressing.It doesn't seem like anyone found that,my work-around was this great Asian sesame dressing with a few sprinkles of powdered Ginger added.Based on the reviews, I also lessened the miso paste to about half and lessened the water just a bit.I added a little basil.The sauce was incredible.I found it to be delicious and just the right consistency.However, I doused my salmon with it, and perhaps I shouldn't have done that.I skipped poaching, and after following the baking/broiling time exactly, my salmon was still not cooked. Served it to my boyfriend.He asked that it be put back in the oven(embarrassing!)After another 15 mins I served it.It was still super moist, maybe slightly mushy.Fantastic flavor,I don't know if I had too much sauce or if salmon is just not his thing since he prefers steak.May try on a different fish.

Followed the recipe to a T. Oh so good! A good way to use up leftover miso when I buy a container of it to make miso soup.

I'm quite a fan of the recipe's ingredients but am sorry to have wasted my fresh salmon on this recipe. I found it to be quite/too salty.  It may be the miso paste I had on hand but never noticed the over-saltiness in the soups I've made before with this paste. I think the proportions of the ingredients are off. Cut way back on the miso. I won't be trying this again.
