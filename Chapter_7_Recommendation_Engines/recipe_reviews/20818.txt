I liked this!  It tasted just like carrot cake.  Instead of baby food, I used grated carrots.  Is also a pretty healthy snack!

Delicious! -- I made 2 modifications. As recommended by others, I added 1/2 cup of raisins.  Also, I needed to use up some carrots, so I made my own carrot baby food. -- I microwaved a half bag of baby carrots in salted water until very soft, then mashed them with a mixer. (This was a little messy.) I will definitely make this recipe again but next time I will use a food processor or blender to mash up the carrots.

This was VERY moist bread (must be the baby food), and with a lot of spicy flavor.  I put both walnuts and raisins in it and the texture was great.  I think the recipe is written a little wrong though.  I only made one loaf with the amounts given, and I think I'd use a little more salt in it (but I'm a salt freak, so that might be completely subjective).  But all in all, GREAT STUFF!

The bread was good, but the recipe is slightly off.  The first thing I noticed is that there is no mention of when to add the baby food.  I added it with the wet ingredients before I combined wet and dry.  Also, this only made 1 very small loaf of bread, not two as the original recipe suggests.

this was good bread, but changed the recipe some. added grated carrots instead of the baby food. 

beat the sugar and oil together, then added the eggs. stired in all of the spices, then carrots until it was smooth, then stirred in the flour without sifting it. (actually used an auto mixer, came out sticky, may have been hard to do by hand, i don't know)

prepped the loaf pans with spray and flour, filled about half way,baked for 45 mins @350, came out nice and dense, and the crust was, kinda crusty. i like dense bread so it came out awesome. a simple icing over the top mades it a tasty dessert bread, and great with butter. doubled the recipe, made 4 small loaves

i used canned carrots. using 2 pans it only took 30mins. of course they're small loaves, good for kids though. I do think it needs the spices doubled. Kinda bland.

Great flavor and very moist! Instead of the carrot baby food, I use a cup of pulp from my juicer.  Generally, combo of carrots, apple and what ever else combined to make the juice of the day.

Great recipe! We ate it with cream cheese.  I used grated carrots instead of baby food though, but I like the idea!

This bread is ok...a bit bland.  I do like it because it's not too sweet (I used brown sugar instead of white). 

I agree with other reviewers that the recipe is a bit off - only produced enough batter for 1 loaf.  Also, the recipe recommends baking for 50-55 minutes which is way too long!  mine baked fully in 35 and even then the edges are a bit crispy.  Set the timer for 30 and check it then.

Very good recipe. I halved the recipe and made a couple of substitutions: a cup of grated carrots instead of baby food and three table spoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. I omitted the walnuts because Iâ€™m allergic. The extra carrots took the place of the nuts. The bread came out moist and delicious. This was a great way to use up some carrots I had on hand.

I made this, and against my better judgment added the 1c sugar as called for. Baking carrot cake in a bread pan does not make it bread. This is carrot cake, not carrot bread.  I had made a puree of roasted carrots and ginger and wanted to bake it up so as to not allow it to go off.  Omitting the sugar for a cake, I repeated this recipe. I used 1c of my roasted carrot/ginger puree, 1/2 cup julienne carrots and 2T minced ginger plus 1 egg to the batter.  Baked as directed in 2 bread moulds and it was beautiful.  I took it to work and was asked which bakery I'd bought it from!

I made seven loaves for my daycare snack, to use up a lot of leftover cooked carrots, and it was well received. I left out the cherries, coconut, and nuts, subbed half the oil with applesauce, added vanilla and more cinnamon. It's a pretty dense, moist bread. It wa October and the teachers called it "Halloween bread" because of the little orange strands of carrot. I'd say it tasted mostly of the vanilla and cinnamon - these kids are pretty picky so we will definitely make it again!

Ok, it seems as though everyone is rating this recipe based on the modifications they made... I am another to add to the list. I do have to give 5 stars though because the main recipe is a good rule of thumb to start with. 
My changes to make it low cal:
Used whole wheat white flour
Added two 4oz jars banana baby food
one 4oz jar carrot
one 4oz jar peach
1/4c unsweetened applesauce (to replace 1 of the 1/3 cups of oil)
1/3c veg oil (instead of 2/3 which is a ton of oil. YUCK)
used splenda sugar blend and cut the sugar amount to 3/4 rather than 1c
used 1 jumbo egg
added 1/2c flaked coconut

Totally nothing like the recipe but YUM.

This is a wonderful bread. I used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour. I also made muffins with this recipe. Easier for the kids to grab when we are on the go and the LOVE IT!!

I love making recipes a bit healthier for my children. They absolutely loved this bread. I substituted whole wheat flour for the regular flour. I also used fresh carrots (1 1/2 cups) finly minced in food processer. In regard to the vegetable oil I used only 1/3 cup olive oil) and then added 1/3 cup plain organic yogurt. Instead of white sugar I used an equal amount of brown sugar. I added slightly more of a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon because we love cinnamon. The recipe came out great, the kids (age 10,8 and 5) wolfed it down. Now my kids do tend to like less sweet type things and this bread fits that bill. It is not overly sweet at all,which I like. The texture with all of my changes was perfect,one of the best breads I have made. I baked it for about 55 minutes.

This bread is so moist and delicious!  My children devoured it.  If I modified the recipe any, I may have used a little more carrot baby food and a little less spice to make sure my kids would eat it.  Everyone who eats this bread wants the recipe!

I've made this several times, and my family and I really like this bread!  My five year old son is excited when I make this.  Followed the tip about making the carrot baby food, and it works great every time.
