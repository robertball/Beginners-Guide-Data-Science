I made this recipe exactly as directed and thought it was just "okay".  So I added about a cup and a half of cubed velveeta with a little milk, melted it in the microwave and added it along with 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin and about 1/4 teaspoon of chili pepper flakes.  It was great and I will continue to make it this way, it was delicious.

The soup was easy to make but I wouldn't call it spicy.  The soup was somewhat bland so I had to add my own spice.  A little cumin, cayenne, salt and sliced avocado made the soup a little more tasty.  I would recommend this soup but with a little tweaking.  Maybe adding a !!

FANTASTIC.  I left out the green peppers and used chopped jalepenos instead of the green chile peppers.  Perfectly spicy. It is great for when you have a cold, but don't wait until you get one to enjoy this yummy, yummy soup. 10 stars :)

My family is so funny when it comes to "spicy" meals.  One time, its way too hot while another is too mild.  In this case, we thought this was great! My six year old ate two small bowls without complaint.  However, I added an extra cup of chicken broth and 1 cup dry noodles when you add the tomatoes and chilie peppers.  When the noodles were cooked through and the soup was ready to serve, we topped each bowl with a little chedder cheese. This may have reduced the heat somewhat. Will be making this quick and easy soup again!

4 stars for ease but 3 stars for taste.  It does need a few customizations.  I added seasoned salt, chili powder, cayenne, and a dash of hot sauce (I like it spicy!).  The recipe is good as a base ... you can add more vegetables: celery, cabbage, corn, beans - whatever you like!

Yum. I did add some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and some cayenne to kick up the heat. A great "healing" soup for colds and the like.

Very yummy and simple! I added chopped jalapenos, chili powder, and cumin for extra spice. Served with crunched tortilla chips on top. Perfect for someone with a cold.

After reading the reviews, I thought I would have to add more spice.  I used the medium tomatoes  and green chilies and it was wonderfully spicy. Did not have to add anything. It was delicious, simple and low calorie.  Love it!  Thanks.

I was skeptical that this was going to be good without any cheese or rice or potatos but it was VERY good.  I did add 1 tsp of chilli powder, a can of green chiles and a dash of Tabasco.  I give it 4 stars as is and can be easily changed to your liking.  A good soup recipe for those on a low or no carb diet.

I had some chicken breasts in the fridge I had to use and since this was the first really cold fall day I wanted to make some soup.  I went to this site, found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  My chicken made 3 cups which isn't too much and I will probably use 3 cups whenever I make this again.  I made this exactly as printed except for the green bell peppers.  We DO NOT like any bell peppers regardless of color!!  Instead I put 1.5 cups of corn in with the liquid ingredients.  Simmered for 15 minutes and then tasted the broth.  We like our food a little spicier so I followed another reviewers advice and added chili powder, cumin and red pepper flakes.  Let that simmer for a few minutes, then added a can of Campbells cheese soup to make give it a little more "body."  While it was simmering right before serving, I cut corn tortillas in 1/4 inch strips and deep fried them.   I dished up the soup, put a little "birds nest" of tortilla strips on top and let me tell this is absolutely the best soup I've ever had!!  I like the original recipe with the substitution of corn and will probably make it like that most of the time.  Without the cheese soup and tortillas strips this is a wonderful soup that anyone on Weight Watchers could use.  My son and daughter-in-law came over and ate with us and we ate the entire pot of soup.  WONDERFUL. YUM, YUM.  I think next time I will leave off the tortilla strips and fix some jalapeno corn bread.....can't wait.

This soup is simple and flavorful.  I did add 1/2 of a jalapeno for more kick as other reviews offered.  Excellent!

This soup was good, but it was not very spicy at all.  My boyfriend and I like things really hot, and this just didn't do it.  I liked the ingredients in the soup though - we made our own broth and I didn't want to just throw celery and carrots in it.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll probably make again, but figure out how to make it spicier.

I made this soup and it was a huge hit! It's hard to make anything spicy enough for my Texas man, but this was great. The next day after the peppers had a bit more time to release flavours it was even hotter. I added crunched tortilla chips and a sprinkle of cheese to take away a bit of the heat for myself, but it was perfect!!!

Good. I added velveeta, leftover chicken--cooked whole chicken (5lb) in crock pot-used part for homemade chicken and noodles) and a can of cheese soup.  Husband didn't like it as much as others that I have made.  I probably make again ...when we need a quick and easy change.

I had a couple extra chicken breasts in the fridge and some veggies I wanted to get rid of so I tried this recipe out with a few minor changes.  I didn't leave anything out from the original recipe but I did follow a few others' advice and add 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp chili powder.  I also added about 1/2 cup of zucchini I had on hand, same with some celery and then a can of corn (drained).  I thought it turned out really nice.  It was a good spicy soup that went well with tortilla chips.

Next time I might follow some of the other users advice and try a little cheese and milk for a thicker soup.

Overall, good soup though.

My husband usually makes the chicken soup for me when I'm sick, but since he was away this time, I was on my own.  I tried this recipe and it was delicious; it really made me feel better.  I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I diced up a couple of fresh ones and added two hot jamaican peppers.

I made this tonight... and it didn't taste like much of anything. I had to keep adding stuff to get it to have any flavor other than spicy... and I like spicy. I added some apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, Adobo Powder, chives, oregano, and Cumin at the end because it had no flavor... that didn't do enough so I added a can of Cream of Celery soup for flavor and some rice to bulk it up out of desperation. Not disgusting, but not a keeper.

This recipe was pretty good and very easy as well. Fresh green chile would make this way better and is something I will try next time I make it. Try adding a can or two of cream of chicken soup if you like thicker soups.

Wonderful soup!  I made it on Christmas day for a casual celebration... soup and sandwiches.  It was so tasty and so simple to make.  I used canned chicken so it made it even easier.  The broth was great with an added kick!  I am definitely making this again!  Perfect for a winter soup!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make. Made a couple of changes:
1. added about a cup of water that was used to boil the chicken. 2. sliced the garlic 3. Added noodles at the end. 4. used fresh tomotoes (sliced) instead of canned tomatoes. I think the next time we will add rice instead of the noodles. Tasted like the chicken soup that we really like at El Campasino.

After reading the reviews how it wasn't too spicy (and knowing my ability to handle fiery foods), I kicked things up a notch by seasoning my chicken with red pepper powder (I didn't have precooked chicken, so my soup took a bit longer to make). I also sprinkled about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes over it while everything simmered. Finally, rather than using the diced tomatoes with chiles, I used 1 fresh roma tomato, and diced an entire jalapeno (keeping the seeds and ribs). The end result? Deliciously spicy and savory. Thanks to the low calories, this will be kept in my regular rotation. Thanks, Kathleen!

This recipe has the added benefit of being healthy. I used the hot variety of diced tomatoes (Rotel brand) and my wife and I both enjoyed the flavor. If you don't like food spicy, go for the regular diced with green chile peppers, or maybe even leave out the chile peppers. This soup recipe should be in the regular rotation for those interested in eating a lean and healthy diet.

Oh my gosh. This soup is my new obsession. I was searching for a recipe to use Rotel (diced tomatoes and green chiles) and chicken. I decided to try this one out since I had everything at home. I was astonished with how easy it was to make. 

My husband and I love spice and we were shocked with how spicy this was! I went to the store today to pick up the ingredients so I could make it again and saw there is an original Rotel and mild Rotel. I am thinking the people who didn't notice the spice, used the mild one.

I placed tortilla chips on the top and that is the perfect way to finish it off!

I made this soup for a sick friend and it was really good.  Quick, easy and just the right amount of spice.

I think this recipe might be a bit spicy for kids but I suppose you could tailor it to be ok.  I LOVE this soup and make it quite often.  I'm not too fond of meats so I often make it without the chicken and eat it with macaroni or egg noodles.   We usually use "hot" tomatoes with chili's.  This one is a keeper!

I  was just looking for a new soup recipe and came upon this one.  I used a combination of green pepper/red pepper/and yellow peppers, a 15 oz can of tomatoes with green chilies, salt and pepper and just a shake of cayenne pepper.  Towards the end I threw in about 1/3 cup of instant brown rice.  My husband and I really liked it.  It was hot, but flavorful.  Will make it again
