I had to make one substitution. I did not have pecan halves on hand, I used party peanuts instead. This is CRAZY good. Like Puppy Chow on crack. We had this for Movie Snacks last night and we literally could not stop eating it. Dangerous.

Delicious! Just the right balance of chocolate, coffee and toffee. Salty pretzels and pecans add extra crunchy goodness. Easy to make, too!

MMMMMM!  This is good stuff!  The only trouble I had was getting the powdered sugar to evenly coat the mix.  I solved my problem by alternating powdered sugar with the mix, then shaking it to coat.  This is definitely going to be a new favorite!

Half of my family is coffee drinkers and we all loved this-the other half, who didn't care for coffee....wouldn't eat it.  It's a great recipe but the coffee taste is strong and very present so you have to know who you're serving with this recipe.  It's like a mocha in a crunchy snack form.

I used three single serve packages of instant coffee, because I enjoy a stronger coffee flavor. This was a perfect snack for my night shift crew.

My husband made this last Christmas for gift bags.  Our friends raved about it!  My husband made a second batch just so he could have some....

Wow, this is really good.  I don't think the coffee flavor is too strong, it's just perfect.  Will make again!

Tastes great and was a hit! I used chopped up Almond Rocha instead of toffee bits and it was delicious.

Fun and different! I didn't notice the coffee at all on my first try, so the next batch, I used 1.5x the coffee and it was yummy!

Yum! Warning: hard to stop eating once you start.  I made this for the grownups on Halloween.  I know it will be a hit.  I had to add a little extra water to the coffee to get it to dissolve- but otherwise just like it says.
