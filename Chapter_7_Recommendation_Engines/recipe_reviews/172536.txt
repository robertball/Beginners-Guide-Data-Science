These are delicious! You'll have to flour the dough and rolling surface quite often, as the dough still remains kind of sticky even after the extra addition of flour. I recommend buying the cookie pop sticks that you can get wherever cake decorating supplies are sold. I made these for Mother's Day, put them in little flower pots and they were a hit! Will definitely make again :)
