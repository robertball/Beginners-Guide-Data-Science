***Just an update to urge you to try this recipe. I always add more pears and also cook it at least 15-20 minutes to pop all the cranberries, thicken it, and to bring out the beautiful color. It is the perfect cranberry sauce and one of my favorite recipes from this site!***Thanks to mail order Christmas gifts, I always have an abundance of pears in the dead of winter. I found this on Allrecipes 2 years ago and it is a perfect combo of pears and cranberries. I have made it for holiday dinners and never get tired of it. It is so simple and so good. Thanks Sue!

This was AWESOME!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  My brother and his wife RAVED about it.  They don't generally like cranberry sauce, but they both had seconds.  My wife and kids liked it as well.  I did follow the suggestions of others to cook in orange juice instead of water, I also cooked the berries first and let them "pop" in the orange juice and sugar.  I simmered them for about 10-15 minutes before adding the pears.  The pears and the honey go VERY nicely with this sauce.  Also, my wife really wanted some oranges in the sauce, so I chopped up an orange and added it when I added the pears.  This was VERY YUMMY.  I mixed up another batch for Christmas dinner, too!

Holy Cow! This recipe is simply divine! The flavors blend so beautifully together, creating a new twist on an old favorite. My husband loved it. He tried it along with another recipe and preferred this one hands down. 
I used Splenda instead of sugar and no one noticed. I used canned light pears instead of fresh and cooked the cranberries longer than recommended.... about 15 minutes. After refrigerating for a couple of hours it took on a jellied consistency that rivaled the canned version (which I love) but the flavor was far superior to any canned variety.  This recipe is a keeper. I will be making it again at Christmas!

Thanks!!!!

Love this! I added a tbp. of Grand Marnier & used orange zest & juice. I did as GrannyLouHoo & cooked for just a bit longer to get the cranberries good & cooked. Loved the pear flavor! I think it helps cut through the tartness of the cranberries. I'll copy Granny & put this in a pretty crystal bowl only I'll garnish it w/ some orange zest. Thansk Sue!

Very good cranberry sauce.  I went with a few reviewer's suggestions to use orange juice instead of water, and I'm glad I did.  I love the added pear and honey flavor, but it's a bit much on the honey--I'd halve it next time since it's a bit too sweet--too sweet even for the bf.  Otherwise, though, this is definitely a lovely cranberry sauce and worth repeating.  I also cooked for about 20 minutes to allow for all of the cranberries to pop.  thanks for the recipe!

We really enjoyed this cranberry sauce for our Christmas Day dinner.  Had several comments from guests who do not ordinarily like cranberry sauce, but had a taste of this and came back for more.  The only change I made was to sub orange juice for the water, and I cooked it for about 15-20 minutes until the pears were cooked through and the cranberries had popped and were blended in well.  Thank you, Sue!

This was really tasty.  I actually made quite a few changes, so maybe I shouldn't be reviewing it at all, but I really appreciated the fact that this had very little white sugar.  In fact next time I might try using honey only.  As it was I used a very strong honey, so I only used 1/2 c and left the amount of white sugar at 1/2 c as well.  I added about 1/2 c of chopped walnuts and replaced the lemon juice/zest with orange.  It made the house smell lovely and tasted even better!

I made this recipe for Thansgiving and for my holiday potluck at work. Everyone loved it so I am making this for Christmas dinner too! I also experinemented a little and added about a tsp of vanilla extract and cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg at the same time as the honey and cranberries.

My husband is a devoted cranberry sauce fan and boy did he LOVE this recipe. I've brought it to our large family Thanksgiving feast 2 years running now and everybody comments that it is the best they've ever had. Try it out (I make it exactly to recipe) you won't be disappointed. :)

Previous experience making homemade cranberry sauce told me I'd have to cook this a little longer than the recipe directed, a good 15 minutes.  Thus far I've only made cranberry sauce with basic variations - the addition of orange juice and zest, or brown sugar instead of white.  Hubs is the cranberry sauce lover in this family and while this variation won't take the place of the traditional style for him, he did enjoy it. The lemon juice and zest coupled with the honey create a balanced and fresh flavor of sweet and tart. The pears were a creative addition that seemed to round out and mellow the flavor of  the bold cranberries.  It was fun to try and I was more than pleased with the unique and delicious results.

This sauce is simply lovely and such a nice change of pace.  Like others, I've cooked it longer (15-20 min) and sometimes replaced the water with OJ.  Either way, it's great.

WAY too much honey and lemon.  It's too tart with a  sickly honey sweet.  Not a keeper here. *Update* Two days later - the strangest thing, it's GREAT!  I'm updating my one star to four!  The first day it was just TOO much everything, but we kept it and it was a little better the next day and even better today.   Wow!  Next year, I'll make it again (using less honey) but I'll make it two days before.

I made this sauce as well as another one from this site (Blue Cranberry Sauce) for Thanksgiving this year.  They were both a big hit.  I preferred the other recipe but many people thought this was the better one.  For me the honey flavor was a bit overpowering so when I make again I think I will try cutting the honey to 1/2 cup and increasing sugar to 1 cup to balance the flavors a bit. I recommend making it at least a day or two before you plan on serving it so the flavors can blend and it will be a nice consistency.  I made it on a Tuesday and it was perfect on Thursday for Thanksgiving. You'll need to simmer the cranberries for about 15 minutes, not 5 as stated in the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I did follow the advice of others and made a few changes. I used 1/2 cup of honey, 3/4 cup sugar and substituted orange juice for the water. I used 3 bosc pears and eliminated the lemon juice and zest. I simmered for about 20 minutes until most of the cranberries had popped. I tried it after it had cooled off a bit. It was good but definitely tasted better the next day. I have eaten it on toast, served it over cream cheese with crackers and actually as cranberry sauce with a nice chicken dinner. Love that this is so versatile. Don't the let the ingredients scare you...it's a great recipe!

I was excited to try this different twist to cranberry sauce especially with ingredients I know I like, but all-in-all I didn't really care for it.  The taste of honey really overpowered the other ingredients. I'm not a picky eater either. I used fresh cranberries, Kroger's brand of honey, and the pears were tasty by themselves, so maybe the store brand of honey was my mistake, who knows.... Most likely won't make again...

I made this for Thanksgiving to do a) something different with Cranberries, and b) try to have a cranberry sauce that has no sugar.  I know honey is sugar, but it's different, and it made my wife happier using honey.  In any event, this came out great!!  Great flavor, great mixture.  I'll keep this and make it again next year.

I just made this last night. I also altered it slightly as others have commented; orange juice for water and a dash of nutmeg. It tastes delicious. Thanks so much

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and was greatly pleased with the results. The combination of flavors is excellent! I did however allow the cranberries to cook 15-20 minutes vs 5 mins (as suggested by others) to really allow the sauce to thicken and bring out the rich color.  Everyone  enjoyed this recipe on Thanksgiving so I am now making it again for Christmas dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing:)

My sister made this on Thanksgiving and my parents loved it, and couldn't stop raving about it. Most of the rest of my family enjoyed it, too. The only change she made was to use apple in place of pear. I didn't try it, but according to everyone else it was a little bit too sweet. Next time we will reduce either the sugar or honey. Thanks so much for sharing!! If my mom has anything to say about it, it will become a new holiday tradition:)

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner tonight, as my family loves homemade cranberry sauces but rarely actually make them. I thought this gelled nicely after about 10-15 minutes of cooking, and the scent of the honey was very nice. I added just a touch of cinnamon for some extra flavor. I do find it a little bit too sweet for my tastes, as I prefer my cranberries a bit on the tart side, but we'll see what the verdict is at dinner!

Its a very good recipe.  I recommend adding more than just 2 pears, I would use equal parts of cranberries and pears.  It goes so well with turkey and mashed potatoes!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. Everyone loved it! Someone had brought some other cranberry sauce from a local bakery, and it was left uneaten, while this got eaten up! Also makes a great addition to leftover apple crisp! :)

Amazing!  I'll never put the canned stuff on the table again!  I used agave instead of the honey and the pot that's on the stove right now has apple and pear in it.  Not too sweet and not too tart ... very simple flavors.  If you're like me and hate orange with your cranberries, this is the recipe for you!

Fantastic!! I wouldn't add a thing...I just used a slotted spoon and took out the majority of the cranberries and pears and lightly blended them...the flavor is absolutely stunning!!

All I can say is WOW! The pears make this dish truly special, in fact, I would add twice as many next time! It's still warm, so I'm super psyched to see the fam's reaction on Thanksgiving!

Delightful! So easy to make. I boiled the sugar & water, then dumped everything in together. Thanks to other reviewers, I used half the honey, a pint jar of pears I canned over summer, orange juice & zest, and a tablespoon of Triple Sec. Simmered 10 minutes & perfection! I LOVE the taste of orange & cranberry together! YUM!

I've used this recipe for years, except that I use canned pears (rinsed, drained and diced) and I add a can of mandarin oranges after cooking/cooling.  I get rave reviews.

This sauce was a little on the sweet side, for me, but it tasted great. I served it on the side of a cheesecake and the flavors balanced very well.

this is a keeper, however the joy of cooking is tweaking. I did not use the lemon juice, used only 1/4 cup of honey, increased the sugar, added 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract, 1/4 teaspoon good quality vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon of Mexican cinnamon .Mashed the cranberries slightly. very good thank you

I absolutely love this recipe. I have never made cranberry sauce before but I had some fresh cranberries I needed to use up (and some pears, luckily). SO GOOD! My husband's comment was "tart". But he didn't not say he didn't like it so that's a good thing.

This is without a doubt the best recipe for cranberry sauce that I have ever tasted.  I made it for family at Thanksgiving and it went over so well that I made a double recipe and sealed up four 1/2-pint jars (water bath) and put the remainder in the freezer.  I did reduce the honey by half and doubled the sugar as other reviewers and I thought it was a perfect balance.  Thank you Sue for such a great recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

I had a similar recipe to this. Adding the lemon is a definite taste bonus. This is the definite side I bring for Mom's turkey. Everyone always loves it.

I did this recipe for Thanksgiving last year but I like my modifications to it better this year.  I used OJ instead of water, I chopped up the pears  from one 15oz can and added the juice to the OJ. I used fresh cranberries and the 1/2 cup sugar but only 1/2 cup of honey, 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon, a squirt of lemon juice and a large strip of orange peel rather than the zest of lemon. I brought it all to a simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes, even with the extra liquid it thickened up beautifully.  I had many requests for this recipe and it's my new favorite.  Thanks for posting it Sue S.

Made it today for Thanksgiving dinner.  I read the other comments and went with some of them.  Used 1/2 cup honey, 3/4 cup sugar, used orange juice (not water), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, & 1 tsp org zest (not lemon).  Love how it tastes and will use it again.  I also used three pears as suggested and simmered it abt 15 min.  It's a winner.

This sauce is a great template and can be modified depending on your own tastes. While I did enjoy the sauce, it was because I had made a couple changes to the recipe. First, I used half a cup of honey and 3/4 cup of sugar instead of one cup of honey and half cup of sugar because I thought that half a cup of honey was already quite strong. I didn't add too much lemon zest, as I didn't want it to smell and taste like dish detergent and instead of a pear, I used an apple. Unless you are a big honey fan, I would not recommend using the full amount of honey.

Every year I make a different cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving because we are not big fans of it and want to try something new.  I made this yesterday; followed the advise of some of the reviewers... added two extra pears cooked in orange juice instead of water and reduced the sugar.  I refrigerated overnight.  We tasted it today and it was very good.  I am sure  the guests tomorrow will enjoy it as much as we did.  Thanks for sharing, Sue S.

Very tasty recipe! I wanted to make a special cranberry sauce for my first Thanksgiving and this fit the bill. The lemon juice and zest give the sauce a wonderful zip. I will be making this again.

This was a real hit at Thanksgiving this year but I'm glad I made it early.  My wife and I tasted it shortly after cooking and almost pitched it.  Needs a day or two in the fridge for the flavors to blend and mellow.

here's the way i made it to make it not so sweet.. the way listed is way sweet  oj instead of water but i did add some water   1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4cup white sugar (added a little more white)  1/2 cup honey  in addition to this I added some ground cinnamon and ground cloves..  which i think made the flavor  when it came time for the lemon juice i was hesitant because it tasted wonderful just as is.. so i added 3/4 tablespoon of lemon juice and it overpowered it a bit.  I think if you're going to us OJ you can leave off the lemon juice entirely unless you like lemon flavor.  overall the pear flavor is wonderful along with the other spices.. i made the basic sugar/ water/ cranberry 2 years ago and this was much better

What a wonderful recipe, this was the first time I ever made cranberry sauce. I am not a lover of it but decided to try it and it is beautiful. For those people who don't like the sauce style try making it into a jelly. Once it was cooked I just used my hand blender to whip it up and then strained it. I then added 1 packet of gelatine and whipped it again then put in small containers to cool in the fridge. Once cooled I put the ones i did not use for the dinner in the freezer. They turned out beautiful. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I have never cared for cranberry sauce, and in looking for something that is different than what I am used to, I tried this recipe.  It was a huge hit.  The flavor is great.  It was perfect and I still have leftovers which is good for me.  It was a great dish in my totally from scratch Thanksgiving.  Thanks...it's a keeper.

Wow.  I've never really been a fan of cranberry sauce.  My family typically slices up a can of the jellied stuff.  Not this year!!  I made it last night and froze it. Subbed orange juice for the water, simmered everything (but the lemon zest and juice) for 15 minutes, then added the zest and lemon juice.  It's VERY sweet and VERY tangy and absolutely beautfiul looking.

I only gave three stars because I did not like the taste of honey with the cranberries.  It was too much, I might try again minus the honey and add more sugar.  I like the pears with this recipe.

I liked this but it had too strong of a honey taste for me. I like honey, but didn’t like a whole cup. Next time I’ll use less honey I think.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was quite good. I thought the honey was a little overpowering flavor-wise so would reduce that next time. But most of the guests did like this.

For me, it was perfect, with the following tweaks... Fresh juice from 2 large oranges instead of water (about 1/2 cup), 1 tsp orange zest, 1/4 cup plus 4 tsp sugar, 1/2 cup honey, 1 cinnamon stick, 8 whole cloves (remove the cinnamon and cloves after cooking). I prefer my cranberry sauce on the tart side. Thanks for sharing, I’ll definitely be making this again!

I too used OJ, instead of water. Only addition I did, after complaints from the picky eaters about the 'juice' running all over the plate, the last few years, after removing from the heat, and in this case, when I add the lemon juice, I add a packet of unsweetened gelatin to it and stirred in. Gels it nicely as it cools, and easier to serve w/o needing a separate bowl!

I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's so easy and is the absolute best cranberry sauce EVERRRRR.  I omit the sugar because the honey is plenty sweet for the dish. Sometimes instead of lemon I'll use orange zest/juice. It's perfect.

Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving from a modified, tripled version of this recipe -- for the base liquid, substituted 1/2 OJ for water and reduced the sugar to be a 3:2 proportion to the liquid;  used 7 pears (mix of Bosc and Bartlett) with a 2 lb bag of cranberries; used only 1/2 the honey called for; cooked the combined mixture for 15-20 min to break down the fruit more.  It was still quite sweet, which everyone really loved (my uncle called it the best cranberry sauce he'd ever had and asked for the recipe two days later), though I still think I will reduce the sugar further next time.

This was really good! Although I was already making pear sauce in my crock pot, I wanted something more than just pear sauce. So I saw this recipe, added a bag of frozen cranberries and 3/4 C. raw honey and cooked it w/ my 28 peeled, cored and chopped pears. I left out the lemon juice, and lemon zest. There was already some water and sugar in the pear sauce before I found this recipe. So basically, it's pear sauce w/ honey and cranberries- Yummy! I am canning it in pint jars- hot water bath for 10 minutes.

Omit the honey. It is way too sweet. I usually start by using only 1/4 c. of sugar and add the other 1/4 c. after cooking if it is too tart. The ripeness of your fruit is going to affect how sweet this turns out. I also omit the lemon juice and zest as I don't like the bitter taste of zest and the cranberries are sour enough without adding lemon juice. I put 1/2 c. water, 1/4 c. sugar, 2 pears that have been peeled, cored and diced and 12 oz. of fresh or frozen cranberries in a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until the cranberries pop. Taste and stir in more sugar if necessary.

I  love cranberries  and I  buy as many  bags  as I can  during  the  season. This  recipe  is  so much  better than using  just sugar and  water. I  usually  get a lot  of  pears for Christmas  and  this  is  a  perfect  way to  use them. I  didn't  use the  hone because  I  don't  like  it  and I  thought  it  would  be  too sweet. Using  2 pears eliminates  the  need  for  granulated  sugar. I used unsweetened  apple sauce  for additional  sweetener. I  also  put in a bit of  cream of  tartar  to thicken the sauce. When  the  pears were gone I used peeled apples. Although  I  modified  the  recipe  to my taste, thank you  so much  for  sharing. It's  a  great  recipe.

I followed the recipe with one tweak and one change.  My tweak was to cook the cranberries longer - about 15 extra minutes stirring frequently. My change was After my sauce was cooled  to room temperature, I put it into the blender and pulsed it a few times to break up the chunks. We prefer a smoother sauce versus the chunky and it was fabulous!!

Easy and delicious! This is a great base recipe that can be adjusted as needed. As is, it is perfect for Thanksgiving. Add a little sprinkle of clove and cinnamon, and it's perfect for Christmas! A fall and winter favorite!

This recipe is fantastic! I doubled the recipe, yet omitted the lemon (as it was tart enough). It turned out so good, tart and sweet, better than any store purchased cranberry sauce. I sterilized jars for longer storage.

Made this got a Thanksgiving, and we all loved it.  The honey flavor was prominent but not in a bad way.  Will make again, but with a little less sugar, I think.

Really good recipe. Made exactly recipe first time. This time I added orange juice instead of water. Sorghum molasses instead of honey. Honey crisp apples in place of pears. Also threw in a handful of chopped dried apricots. Man oh man it kicks it up even more. Definetly a great based to put our own twist on.

This has got to be the best cranberry sauce I have had. I've tried many. I did use Splenda instead of the sugar and only 1/2 cup of honey from my husbands bee hives because it did sound like it would be too sweet. It came out perfect. I am so glad I did purchase the fresh cranberry s especially after reading about the farmers who grow the cranberries. They have produced more than they can sell so now prices are falling drastically. There is also another cranberry dip recipe on this site I am going to try next. Happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy!

I'm so thrilled to find this recipe on here!  It has been our traditional cranberry sauce for the past 20 years or so.  Wonderfully tart, amazing texture...simple to prepare.  Make a day or two ahead of time and refirderate it.

I had already cooked up a bag of cranberries for whole cranberry sauce, then had a couple ripe pears to use up, so I simmered the pears in the juice of an orange and a little cranberry-pomegranate juice and maybe 1/2 cup of honey. I then added the cranberry sauce to pear mixture after it had simmered awhile. The result was very yummy.

I followed the original recipe exactly (minus one cup of honey) and everyone loved it. I read the comments AFTER making the dish and agree with most of them. In my dish, there was just the right amount of honey taste, IMO, so adding that extra cup would've been too much. Also, it definitely tastes better the longer it sits.

This recipe is fantastic! It had a specific, special taste that you may find at the Ritz or the Waldorf on their holiday menu. No trouble to make. I used fresh cranberrys that required closer to 20 minutes cooking time rather than 5. If you make this, your guests will rave. Mine did!

Way too sweet for my tastebuds.  Next time I would cut the honey to 1/4 cup and add another pear as the pear and cranberry work well together.

Excellent!  I used orange juice instead of water and 1/4c of honey instead of the full amount.  (I may use 1/3c next time though.)  Either way, this cranberry sauce is so worth making.  It's incredibly simple and much better than the canned stuff!

I used a jelly jar of "pear honey" (made with pears, sugar, and crushed pineapple) that I canned this summer, used the jar to measure the orange juice (as suggested by other reviewers) so it was equal parts OJ and pear honey, and a 12 oz. bag of fresh cranberries.  Cooked for 15-20 minutes til all cranberries popped and the mixture was nicely thickened.  It's already a thick consistency; I'm sure it'll be more "gelled" by the time we have our meal.  As suggested, I'm making it a few days in advance so it has adequate time to set. It's beautiful, smells wonderful, and yummy.

This recipe is so unbelievably easy and delicious.  I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The holidays just wouldn't be the same without it.  I leave out the lemon zest and it's still superb.  This year I forgot the lemon juice too and it was just as good as ever.  Always plan ahead and make it the day before.  It needs that overnight in the fridge to develop a nice consistency.

It looks pretty, and is easy to make, but I think it tastes way too lemony. I'm hoping that a night in the fridge will help blend the flavors... if not, Im going to have to trash it and go for the store bought. I gave it 2 in hopes that it has potential to tast better in the morning...

I just made this for Thankgiving.  It is still warm and I can definitely say citrusy!  I used 1 cup of OJ instead of water, and only 1/2 cup of honey. The honey taste is noticable, so if you don't like honey you may not like this sauce.  The honey I used is also a lime honey from Grand Cayman my husband and I got when we went on a cruise last spring. The pears give this a sweet taste as well.  We shall see what everyone says on Thursday!

Heaven on a stick!!  Followed exactly, used organic pears, fresh crannies.  SUBLIME!  And a beautiful color!  I love how the pears soak up the honey and maintain a bit of their crunch.  MMMMMmmm!

Am I the only person who eat cranberry sauce when it's not fall or winter?? :)  This was very good.  I added a dash of cinnamon.  And I did not have any lemon zest so I doubled up on the lemon juice.  I also used raw sugar. I boiled the cranberries for 15-20 minutes to get a thicker sauce.  I have tried many different cranberry sauce recipes over the years, and this one is my favorite so far.

Good quick and easy recipe.  Honey flavor is definitely discernible, which can be good or bad depending on your taste.  I may try again with orange juice, as other reviewers have suggested, and I think this will improve it for me.

My first try at homemade cranberry sauce this Thanksgiving and it was amazing - I'll never go back to canned. The consistency of mine was somewhere between a jelly and a whole berry sauce - the best of both worlds.

A wonderful addition to any Thanksgiving feast! I followed others' suggestions and sub. orange juice for the water and used an extra pear...perfect sweetness to counter tart cranberries.

I've never cared too much for cranberry sauce, but this recipe changed my mind.  Made it for Thanksgiving last year and got rave reviews.  The pear cuts some of the tartness of the cranberries and the honey adds an unexpected sweetness.  Highly recommend!!

This was so easy to make and it turned out wonderfully!!  It was everyone's Thanksgiving favorite including my own.  Note:  Ignore the 5 minute instructions after the cranberries are added.  It was more like 20-25 minutes for me.  You'll LOVE this recipe!!

Simply easy and excellent! The taste is amazing. Not to bitter or sweet! I added an additional pear to my recipe. Beats the life out of the canned Jelly cranberries.
