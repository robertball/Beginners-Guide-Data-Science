I'm happy to be the first to review this recipe. It is delicious! We live in a predominantly  Italian area of northeastern Ohio and my husband and I have enjoyed this soup in several area restaurants... this version is very authentic tasting. Just be sure to have warm crusty bread on hand, and if you're like my husband, extra red pepper flakes :) Next time I make it he said be sure to double it!

My grandmother used to make this (using any kind of pork she happened to have on hand, or meatless) all of the time and -- specifically because escarole is too bitter for my taste -- I never liked it and have always "adapted" her recipe by substituting spinach for it. But my husband likes escarole (he orders it every time we go to dinner at a local Italian restaurant), so the other day when escarole was on sale for $0.79 per pound and a bag of spinach was selling for $2.99, I thought I'd give him a thrill. I par-cooked 3 boneless pork chops (instead of the bacon) in a little bit of butter and a splash of olive oil, added a handful of baby carrots and a T. of granulated sugar to my pot and cooked everything together for 45 minutes. My husband loved it, and promised that if I would make this for him at least "sometimes", he'd never ever again spend $6.95 for a bowl of escarole soup (sounds  like a plan). As for me? I still don't like escarole, but prepared this way, I had to begrudgingly admit that it was at least "quite edible".

This recipe is awesome, i made it for my family a few times. I also used Smoked pork hocks (yea sounds gross lol) but it gave it a really good flavor in stead of the bacon. I also cut small pieces of ham in it.  Guess what is for dinner tonight :)

I substituted the escarole with spinach because I did not want to chance the bitterness of the escarole.  The entire family loved the recipe, including my wife and our 11 year old.

I found this receipe to be great.  Good to bring to the office for lunch.  I added bulgar and it was fantastic.  Good with just using vegatable broth and my vegan neice says it's the best.

Really great flavor from the escarole,  Added another can of chicken broth and a chicken bouillon cube at the simmer stage for even more flavor.

This makes four small servings - fine for a side or a starter, but if you're making this your main meal double the recipe.  We added extra hot pepper flakes and a pinch of salt to our bowls.

Delicious - a light soup with a nice garlic flavor.  Skipped the red pepper because we don't like it and we didn't miss it at all.  Did not find the escarole bitter either.  Enjoyed it very much.

Delicious, but what do you do with the bacon?  It doesn't say if you're supposed to throw it out or put it back in at the end...I used pancetta and put it back in but it got really bacon-y after a day so I might skip that step altogether next time.

Wonderful recipe.  This is genuine Italian.  I added 1/2 potato, chopped; 1/2 onion, chopped and sauteed.  I replaced the bacon with 1/4 pound fried Italian sausage.  It's good with lima or great northern beans instead of the cannellini.

For those who really love bitter greens, replace half of the endive with Catalogna chicory (the stuff that looks like dandelion greens).  You will probably have to grow it yourself.  You will need to add a little sugar to kill some of the bitterness.  Now you've got a masterpiece.

I doubled the greens and the broth and added more red pepper flakes, as well as salt and pepper. Very tasty and will make it again.

Delicious. Will become a household favorite because it's quick and delicious.  Modifications: I use cured and smoked bacon (3 slices, sliced into 1/2" wide lardons) and instead of  canned broth I make 2 cups of Chicken Bouillon.  I add the bacon back into the soup just before serving and sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of Parmesan cheese over the top.

I bought some escarole from the farmers market and had no idea what to do with it. I found this recipe luckily and had a meal ready in 15 mins. I am vegan so I omitted the bacon and used veg broth. I had to add a bit of salt, prob not necessary if you are using bacon. But it was pretty good. Will make again

I didn't have bacon so I substituted 1/4lb ground pork. I Increased the broth to 1 quart and did not drain the beans. Finally, I added 2 tbsp Locatelli cheese directly to the soup.

I've made it 3 times and am making another batch right now. I didn't change anything except a little extra garlic. I love to "strushe" (dunk) stale Italian bread into it and "mangia"

Very good!  Nice hint of heat from the red pepper flakes and the escarole still has a nice texture after cooking down.

My son declared it "restaurant quality". I omitted bacon (didn't have any on hand)...used 1T bacon fat with the oil. Used 32 oz boxed chicken broth, extra large head of escarole torn into bite sized pieces, added red pepper flakes while sautéing garlic in the oil to bring out more flavor, added 1/4 cup soup pasta at the end and cooked 15 minutes longer. Added 1 pkg. bacon bits and cooked 2 more minutes. Delicioso!

I made this tonight with Italian Endive from the local farmers market, plus my spouse's homemade pancetta in place of the bacon.  It was exceptionally good.  So simple!  This is definitely moving to the top of my list for a quick and delicious dinner.

As I was making this recipei I realized it was too soupy for my liking. I added an additional can of beans and pureed 1/3 of the beans. It gave it a heartier texture. also, instead of bacon I used smoked ham hocks. I boiled then until cooked in the chicken stock and used that as my stock. You will ave to add some more liquid to make the 15oz, I added the edible pork to the soup.

This was fantastic. I made it as directed but didn't add the bacon back in and put the cheese in while it was still simmering. My advice is to buy quality beans for this one since they are center stage. I used Eden Organics Cannelli and they were deliciously creamy. Also, if this is your main dish, it will only serve two.

This is awesome! Not much to say about it really, simplicity at it's finest. I did have to skip the bacon as the package I had was growing black spots. And I only had a 10 oz can of chicken broth, so I used that it was plenty liquidy for me. Very nice.
