Makes the most amazing chicken noodle soup!!  I buy a whole bird and make the Sticky Rotisserie chicken from this site.  After dinner I remove the remaining meat and put the carcass, skin and everything else in cheese cloth.  After making the broth I simply remove the two cheese cloth "bags" and add noodles, peas and the leftover chicken I pulled from the night before.  This is one of the few recipes my entire family LOVES to eat!!

I dont have ice cube trays so I use muffin pans. Each holds exactly 1/3 cup of stock so it makes measuring how much I need for recipes very easy.

This a really good stock I make mine the same the only thing that I do different is I use a large tea type ball and put all the spices in there that way I don't have to use the cloth. I also use the ball when I cook corned beef I put the spices in the ball that way I don't have to plow through all of the spices still have the flavor but no mess. I also strain the just of the chicken broth with a chinois....It is a very fine strainer really really fine.

This recipe produces a good stock but seems overly fussy. Most recipes put all the ingredients in together. If all of the solids are going to be strained out why bother with tying herbs up in cheesecloth. Also all of the ingredients are going to cook for at least of couple of hours so why bother staggering their addition. Just put them in at once.

A bsic stock recipe to which I also added fresh sage leaves. Homemade stock is always great to have on hand and really SOOOO easy to make many quarts to freeze for fresh homemade stock anytime you need it. Better than the boxes/cans.

i also add sage and sometimes thyme. i save vegetable peals and trimmings instead of using "good" veggies. onion skin adds nice color to the stock.

I have been making stock like this for years! I always have everyone I know save their turkey carcass after Thanksgiving for me. I roast the bones and veggies to a deep brown color as it enriches the flavor of the stock. I never use cheesecloth just strain out all the bones/veggies.

In terms of ingredients this recipe is almost identical to what I do. The biggest difference is that I use a pressure cooker which speeds cooking time considerably. I also add more garlic because I like it--no need to peel it even. To each their own but I don't bother tying up the spices in cheesecloth (or in a tea ball). Everything gets strained at the end anyway so it really isn't necessary.
