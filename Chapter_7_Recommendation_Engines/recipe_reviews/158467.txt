Simple, elegant, delish! This was a wonderful dinner to prepare mid-week that was quick and flavorful...not to mention pretty on the plate when I sliced on a sharp diagonal and placed on a bed of wilted spinach. **In place of tenderloin, I used pork chops we had in the freezer and used a white onion in place of the shallot, which was just fine for us. I loved the reduced balsamic sauce with the tart cherries... I could eat that by itself! This recipe would work well with chicken too.

There is a similar recipe on the food network site, Ellie Krieger's show.  Doesn't matter where it came from however, as it is EXCELLENT.  The only change I made was I doubled the sauce, and added about a teaspoon of sugar (give or take, I didn't measure) to the sauce at the end to cut the tartness. The entire family loved it!  It was fast, very simple and looked fabulous. Would be excellent for entertaining!

This recipe was simple to make and was delicious!  I will serve it to guests--perhaps on a mound of garlic mashed potatoes with asparagus spears on the side (of the pork, not the guests!).
