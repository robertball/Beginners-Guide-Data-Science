Very good. I substituted Lorna Doones for the graham crackers and omitted the sugar. Also, I only had one 5 oz can of evaporated milk so I used regular milk for the rest. The pie is mild and definitely comfort food. My kids all loved it. I would make it again. Quick and easy.

This was delish!!!  It was quick, easy and a lighter version of regular pumpkin pie.  I loved it!!  I used a store bought granola crust and also a regular pie crust that I baked first.  They were both good.  Thank you for the recipe.

Just made this tonight and it was a hit!  I had a store bought pie crust so I used that instead of the graham cracker and it was great.  Was quick to put together and we all enjoyed it!
