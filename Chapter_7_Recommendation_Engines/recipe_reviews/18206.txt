This was exceedingly easy to make and the flavor was divine. I halved the sausage, and added a smidge more basil and pepper. I also didn't have onion soup mix and used Knorr Vegetable soup mix.  The chopped tomato in it is a MUST for full flavor. The fresh tomato doesn't cook up all the way adding some great texture to the soup (stew).

The cooking times are accurate and both times I've made it it's turned out perfectly.

This was excellent, quick and easy. I found the onion soup mix a tad bit too salty, but it's still a good winter soup. Will definitely make again!

excellent recipe; I used 1 lb roll of Turkey sausage instead of the links. And I used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the chopped fresh. Be careful to not overcook...noodles will get soggy.

Aunt Mimi knew what she was doing!  Behind the recipe for Gorgonzola Dip from this website this is the best recipe I have come across on here.  The only change I made was to keep the sausage in the casing.  Yum!

The only difference I make is add garlic and depending on how soupy you like it depends on whether to cook the noodles separate and then add to soup or cook in broth. Oh yeah and I just use Jimmy dean Italian sausage.

This was *outstanding*.  I made some changes, like using a box of vegetable stock (32oz) and then added 3 additional cups of water.  I also used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with their juice.  I had 1.5 lb italian sausage so I used that, rather than buy links and take it out of the casings.  I also bought a 20 oz container of tortellini and used that.  I basically threw everything in the pot and LOVED the results.  This was one of the best soups I've ever eaten and definitely the best soup I've ever made!  Yum!!

I added sliced carrots at the same time that the tomatoes, etc were added. The carrots were delicious in this soup and make the soup a bit more healthy.

This is a great recipe.  I love that it is a one-pot meal that comes together quickly and easily without a lot of chopping, or preparation. This makes clean-up a snap. Whole family loved it, including my children ages 3 and 4. It's a thick soup, which we prefer. Thanks for the post!

When I started this recipe I didn't know whether to called for "fresh" or "frozen" tortellini.  I only had frozen so I put in with the cabbage, tomatoes and herbs.  I thought I had onion soup mix but didn't.  I used oregano, basil, onion powder and salt and pepper instead.  I grated fresh parmigiano-reggiano cheese on top.

Delicious!  I used a bag of frozen broccoli instead of the cabbage and it was wonderful.  Also added a few red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent! I used 1/2 regular Italian and 1/2 hot Italian sausage.  Also used Knorr's vegetable soup instead of the onion soup mix as another reviewer suggested.  Since some were unclear about the amount of tortellini - I used a regular sized bag of small cheese ones (packaged, not refrigerated) made by Barilla.  The bag said it makes about 4 cups cooked.  This was a lot given the amount of broth I had, so I just added additional water, as needed.

This soup was absolutely scrumptous and also super easy to make. The only thing I did different was use 2 fresh tomatos instead of 4. This is one of the best and heartiest soups I've ever made. My picky husband even loved it and raved about it all night. It's a keeper!

Have made this three times in three weeks. Twice for us and once for guests. Great with tofu sausage, spinach or cheese torillini or both.  We really really like this one and so do our vegan friends.  Thank you!!

Made major alterations due to needing last minute supper and having limited ingredients.  We had tortellini that were getting old, but my mom wanted more veggies.  The only real fresh veggies we had was a bag of coleslaw mix... and that's how we got to this recipe. So here's what I did: 
- no sausage, used ground turkey with sausage spices
- No stewed tomatoes, used a small can of fire roasted
- No fresh tomatoes, used large can of crushed
- had chicken stock that needed used, so used that instead of water (4 c.) and rinsed the tomato cans with water
- coleslaw mix (green/ red cabbage and carrots) instead of cabbage
- I never measure spices, and we like flavor, so probably used extra of everything

This was an excellent soup, with minimal ingredients.  I like it!  Made a homemade onion soup mix and used fresh basil along with the dried basil.  YUM!  The kids loved it which was a bonus :)

This just wasn't liked by most of my family.  Edible, but not something anyone loved or would ask for again.
