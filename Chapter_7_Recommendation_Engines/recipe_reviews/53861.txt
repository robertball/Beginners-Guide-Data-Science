Looking for creative uses to use up a bottle of vodka. This one was not all that bad. I like the cheery cherry in it. Ha...cheery cherry...ok, that is hard to type. Good night.

I wanted to make something like a Cherry Limeade out of this recipe, so I added the drink ingredients to a cup of diet lemon-lime soda. Very, VERY good. This may be my new favorite drink!

I thought it was great.  It may be too much for some people but that is easily remedied by lowering the amount of vodka used.

This was a little too strong & too tart. I know, I know... I should have expected that from the recipe, & I did, but the tartness exceeded my expectations. ;o) So I hit it w/ some 7UP & that helped...a lot. Thanks for letting me try it Ryan!

Very simple, very yummy. I made myself half the recipe because I don't drink much and it's only 2pm! ;o)

Yum!  This is really refreshing without being too sweet.  It's the perfect balance of tart and sweet.  You could probably make them by the pitcher!

Was looking to use some sweet and sour mix that's just been sitting around and this was perfect!! Only thing we did was cut the sour a bit by adding a small can of ginger ale to top. Thanks for the recipe!

One of my favorite drinks is a Dirty Shirly, so this drink was right up my alley. I did oops and use too much grenadine the first one I made because I misread the recipe (see photo) but  the recipe could also be easily adjusted to your personal taste to get it just how you like it.

This was pretty good but I thought the sweet and sour mix was a little too overpowering, it covered up the taste of the grenadine.

This is very good another site had me add 4 ounce of vodka 4 of sweet and sour and only a tablespoon of cherry which made the vodka and sweet and sour way too over powering. once I did it this way it was perfectly balanced and sooo good exactly what I wanted.

Have made this many times. Sometimes the most simple cocktails are the best ones. Not to strong of a liquor taste - the perfect balance of tart and sweet.
