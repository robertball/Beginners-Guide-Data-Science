I hesitate to review this, bc I really modified it.  But I see it has a bad rating but no reviews, so I'm going to go ahead and review it so that others might be willing to try it.  Please forgive me.  I halved the recipe, since it's just me tonight--probably should've quartered it, but oh, well.  I'm really not too sure about the dough--it's sweet from the sugar, and I had to add about 1 1/2 c of flour to get it a little less runny.  It still ended up like pancake dough, but I figure I could deal with that, and it baked up well enough.  I don't like blue cheese dressing, nor did I have any, so I eliminated that.  I also used sour cream instead of mayo and mixed it up with the refried beans, as I always have difficulty spreading refried beans.  I didn't have chili, but I did have red kidney beans, so I used that in place of the chili.  Also, for flavor I added some taco seasoning.  Again, I know I changed it a lot, but I was happy with my modifications.  The only thing I'm not that thrilled with was the pizza dough--again, the thickness could be due to my halving the recipe--some dough recipes are not that forgiving, but I didn't really like the sweet taste of it, and it ended up somewhat crispy.  I'd be willing to try the recipe again, but with a different dough.  And maybe if the bf's home and I have the other ingredients I'll stay truer to the recipe!    Thanks for the recipe.

I only did the crust and put my own toppings on.  If I do this again I will use less sugar and make two crusts with the dough to make it crispier.  I found the dough to be too sweet for a taco crust, and too thick.

This recipe was pretty good, however, I did substitute regular chili instead of turkey chili.  The crust is a cornbread crust and is intended to be quite gooey and runny when you put it in the pan, but keep the faith, it is tasty when it's done!  All in all, my husband and I thought is was ok, but my very picky kids ate it!

I like the concept of this dish, but the ingredients and crust really didn't appeal to me. 

For one I had to cut down the sugar by 50%, which I still think it was too sweet. Maybe next time I'll try only 1-2 tablespoons. I also added 2/3 cup of cornmeal but I feel like that wasn't enough. I like that it didn't take yeast, but the crust was too soft to be considered a pizza.

I also don't care for blue cheese dressing or hot mayonnaise so I left those out. I also made my own re-fried beans using black beans and garlic. I I added just green chilies instead of the rotel tomatoes and topped the pizza with shredded sharp cheddar. For garnish I did use the lettuce and tomatoes, but added sour cream and salsa for each person to add to taste.

This recipe is a great idea.  Based on personal preference, you can add or change toppings, but the base is excellent!  Thank you!
