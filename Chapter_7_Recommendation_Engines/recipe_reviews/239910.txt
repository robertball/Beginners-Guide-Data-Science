Simple and delicious! I did not use the amounts of basil and oregano called for per personal preference, I just used them to taste I used dried herbs). I wouldn't call this a 'Bolognese', exactly, but more of a meat sauce. Either way, it was a BIG hit with the family, and something I will def be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've made variations of this as my Mother taught me. It's a great sauce if you like making your own, which I do. I usually throw in a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes. They dissolve completely  during cooking, and add an additional layer of goodness, as well as making the sauce a bit thicker if you want a quicker sauce. The hamburger makes it a more hardy pasta meal.  Add a salad and some good bread and you're good to go. :)

For the simplicity of making the sauce it turned out surprisingly well. Rated as recipe was written as all reviews should be. Only suggestions maybe switch herbs around to taste and try some fresh herbs. Definitely worth trying, plenty of sauce left over for quick meals during the week .

Definitely needs chopped onion and pressed fresh garlic saut√©ed to start, then add fresh herbs (basil, oregano) if you have them and works really well with 2 large cans of crushed tomatoes rather than tomato sauce (I sometimes add mushrooms and a bit of red wine as well).  Definitely an easy meal to throw together with some garlic bread and a quick salad.

Followed the recipe except I added a cup of water that the pasta cooked in and simmered for an additional 5 minutes. The family loved it!

I have not made this recipe, however, when reading the ingredients I did spot something the novice may want to be careful of 2 Tablespoons of garlic powder is a lot of garlic for a recipe of this yield.

This was a hit! My children and niece loved it. They said it was way better than any store bought pasta sauce. I'll never buy ready made pasta sauce again.  We used fresh minced garlic and fresh onion instead of the powders and pair it with some Italian garlic bread.

You can always buy pre chopped onions and some garlic like paste to perk this up with a non dried spice basis. It is still easy to make and you just sautee them for a bit (adding maybe 2 - 3 minutes to cook time) This sauce is simple, cooks fast, and tastes great. For an added richness to the flavor you can add a bit of mozzarella cheese or Parmesan directly to the sauce changing the flavor dynamics a bit as well.

Very easy and delicious.  I added one onion that I sauteed then added beef and three Italian sausages.  Also one small can of Italian diced tomatoes went in with some chopped mushrooms.  I added I T of Italian blend seasoning, and 1t of cayenne pepper, and 1/2 c dry red wine and simmered all for 1 hour.  We like a little heat in our sauce, use less cayenne, just a dash, will be good.

I prepared it in my crockpot on low for about 3 hours; which worked very well.  I did a few modifications, left out the hamburger because we were have chicken parmesan.    I reduced the basil and oregano to 2 tablespoons, onion, garlic and sugar to 1 tablespoon, and omitted the pepper.  It had a little zing to it; but we liked it.  Will  make again and was able to freeze a quart size bag of it.

No onion, never sugar, add a large tin of tomato sauce and a large tin of paste....let it simmer for a few hours.  The taste is so different.   I do prefer fresh tomatoes  myself.  I use grape, roma grape, cherry and or roma tomatoes, oven roasted with olive oil, fresh garlic and basil.

I‚Äôm sure I failed to make this properly, based on some of the reviews posted. Hmm, instead of tomato sauce, I guess I should have used a mishmash of ketchup, tomato paste and canned diced tomatoes. Instead of the ground beef, maybe I should have used a mix of ground turkey and texturized vegetable protein. Instead of following any of the instructions I reckon I should have.....well, you get my point. Add my name to the list of cooks asking folks to either evaluate the recipe as written OR post your own fershlugginer recipe!  This is the second time I‚Äôve made it, slavishly following the recipe as presented and guess what?  It‚Äôs terrific just as written!  Easy to make, smells and tastes wonderful, and everyone loves it!

I made this but added two broken up smoked Johnsonville brats and let it simmer on low for 2hr.  The smoky undertone of flavor was awesome.  Also added some red pepper flakes for a extra kick. Thanks

Great flavor, first time I made it so I followed the recipe exactly. It was a bit watery and I lit it simmer for over a couple of hours. Maybe 1 tomato paste instead of all the sauce. Will make again for sure.

Better than any canned sauce. Made it with fresh herbs and I believe it made it GREAT !
