YUmyumyum just had this for breakfast. Since I only made enough for me, I didn't bake the pan in the oven.. just nuked it to melt the cheese. I topped with a little sour cream and snarfed it up!

These are as advertised: easy. I used soyrizo to make this a vegetarian breakfast-for lunch. I topped it off with a lot of hot sauce and sour cream. I'd make it again.

Very good!  Great brunch dish while watching a football game!  I prefer this over Fritos.  VERY tasty.  A little sour cream on top and green onions would make it even tastier...

Was glad I wasn't eating it, but the guys I made it for claims it was okay.

It was delish!!  It was a hit at work and even at home.  I made 2 pans to try it out before taking it to work for a potluck the next day and my bf at the time ate one entire pan!

Great! Used veggie sausage crumbles & added cumin & garlic. Scrambled eggs with salsa instead of tomatoes. Fairly  easy breakfast.
