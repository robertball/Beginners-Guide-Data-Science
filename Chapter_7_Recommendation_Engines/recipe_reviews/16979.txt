I brought this to a relatives party for the holidays and everyone gobbled it up.  Make sure if you only want one ball to half the recipes since it makes two BIG balls.

At first I thought I was doing something wrong - my cheese balls were very lumpy and didn't look too appetizing next to all the other appetizers I made for a dinner party.  However, they were the first to go and the HIT of the party!

I just made this last night.  It was FABULOUS.  I shaped it into a Christmas tree, used the mac and cheese powdered cheese, and a lot more walnuts on the outside.  It was totally gone in a couple of hours.  The only caution I would give is that it is a little challenging to get all the stuff stirred in good- you really have to keep working at it.

Outstanding!!!! So glad that I halved the recipe since I was just making this for the 4 of us. I used Cheese Sprinkles with Salt (like you would put on popcorn) for the cheddar cheese sauce mix, so I used UNsalted butter. This was delicious! Thanks so much for the post!

This recipe is easy and fantastic! My family devoured this cheese ball in about 20 minutes (just a few hours after Thanksgiving dinner)! I'm making it again at Christmas!

It's a good recipe just be careful not to let the cream cheese get to soft before making it.

My cheese ball I add bits of bacon, and some creamed horseradish as a secret ingredient that surprisingly drives everyone crazy wondering what it is. I like the way this cook decorated her cheeseball, how cute and creative...thanks!

This was okay, it was just too mild for me.  I think maybe adding Nacho cheese or some sort of spices might have helped give this more zing for my taste.  Not super flavorful.  Maybe I should have added  more onions...

I'd never made a cheeseball before, and I chose this recipe to use to make my first one.  I made only a couple of small changes:  I used basil instead of parsley and added finely diced red onion in addition to the green onion. I also doubled the amount of cheese powder.

I brought it to work to share with everyone, and I have NEVER heard so many people rave about something or ask for the recipe.  After about the 10th person was exclaiming about the cheese ball, a coworker in a cubicle nearby finally asked, "WHAT did you put in that cheese?? People are going crazy over there!"

All in all, an AWESOME recipe!

I have never made a cheeseball before. I followed the advice of others and added about twice the amount of powdered cheese to it. I also added garlic powder. It was a huge hit!

Delicious and easy.  As suggested, I used the cheese packet from a macaroni and cheese package.  It makes 2 good sized cheese balls so halve the recipe if you only want 1.  Love it! Thanks!

AN EASY RECIPE THAT COMES TOGETHER QUICK I USED MY HAND MIXER TO CREAM THE CHEESE AND THE BUTTER, THEN ADDED THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS I USED A WHOLE PACKAGE OF DRY CHEESE SAUCE FROM THE MAC AND CHEESE, CUT BACK ON THE ONIONS AND ADDED A FOURTH OF A TEASPOON OF CAYENNE.  I FORMED IT INTO TWO HEALTHY BALLS, WRAPPED THEM IN PLASTIC WRAP AND THE ARE NOW RESTING IN MY FRIDGE UNTIL MONDAY WHEN I WILL ROLL ONE IN TOASTED PECANS THE OTHER IN TOASTED WALNUTS AND OFFER THEM UP AT MY OFFICE LUNCHEON.  FROM START TO FINISH THE WHOLE PROCESS TOOK LESS THAN 30 MINUTES.  EVEN BEFORE THE FLAVORS HAD DEVELOPED I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN AWESOME RECIPE.  I HAVE PUT IT IN MY KEEPER FILE.

I made this for christmas last year and since then every holiday i get marked down to bring it!!!  It is great!  Tollhouse butter crackers go with it wonderfully!! I add a lot more cheese powder than it asks and it was better!! I love the cheese flavor it has, it doesnt taste just like cream cheese like a lot of other ones do.  I know ill be making it again.  Thats all my family wants me to bring for dinners.  and since it makes 2 balls its good if you have to go to both sides of the families homes for holidays!!

I added extra cheese sauce mix, 1 Tablespoon didn't seem enough and I like my cheese.  The green onions were a perfect touch and I DID use the butter.  This definitely needs to sit in the fridge for awhile for flavors to meld (or you WILL taste "just" butter) I made this the day before I needed it).
This turned out FANTASTIC and will definitely be made again.

This cheese ball was excellent! I halved the recipe for only one cheese ball and added worcestershire sauce and 3 T. of chopped green onions. Yum!

I made this for a christmas party and WOW! I actually used cheddar cheese powder from the Bulk Barn in Canada. I will say that using my stand mixer was the trick to get everything incorporated nicely.  I also added a bit of ham to the nut mixture and about 1/2 cup for the cheese ball. Amazing!

I think this is a great basic cheeseball recipe. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and reduced fat cheddar cheese and it worked fine - you'd never know the differenc either but the calories and fat you save are HUGE. I highly recommend doing it that way. I made it for a haloween party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. The only addition I made was some garlic powder. I think it'd be great with a bunch of chopped olives thrown in.

Excellent! The only change I made was adding a bit more of the cheese powder, and I threw some paprika in there too to give it a little kick. I made this the day before serving, and it was delicious! Everyone devoured it.

first time I ever trid a cheese ball, was worried about presentation and all: it really is easy and turns out like it has lots of things in it, when it's basically cheese, onion, lemon and parsley! I did substitute the green onion with a red one, and used a mozzarella&provolone sprinkle.
Ah, and I did halve the quantity, we were 7 people, and half was quite enough. Recipe to save!

This makes a delicious cheese ball.  I refrigerated to harden the cheese and rolled mine in walnuts.  Excellent!!  Keeps its shape well.

I am going to go against the rave reviews of many people and say this recipe was mediocre.  I followed the recipe and it tasted only like cream cheese.  I chose to add a sharp and a mild mixture of cheddar but that was not enough.  I do not know the point of the butter in this recipe - I don't think cream cheese needs anymore buttery taste, really!  Don't use it.  Also, I thought the cheese powder would add some good flavor - but you will need to add almost the entire package rather than the 1 T.  If you like big flavor use this as a good foundation and jazz it up.   Sorry Aunt Phyllis!

this was pretty good. i didnt form them into cheese balls, i just left it as a spread. i used fat free cream cheese and fat free butter to make it a bit lower in fat. worth making again.

I liked the taste, but when I put it on crackers, it was too mild for my liking. After it was chilled, I used a large cookie cutter and shaped it into a bell; it held its shape & looked great.

oh, my.  this was my first time making a cheese ball, so i really appreciated this as a template.  i left out the onion, added cayenne pepper, substituted the cheddar with 1/2 colby and 1/2 pepper jack, and rolled the whole thing in toasted pecans.  my friends, who i had to force to try it, couldn't keep their hands off it (don't you love that?)  they still bug me about making another one.  thanks, natalie.

I can’t believe I’ve never reviewed this recipe. I found it on here maybe 8 years and I’ve made it for so many get togethers since. At least 4 times a year. EVERYONE loves it! I make no changes except I usually don’t roll in nuts. Sometimes I don’t roll in anything and others I’ll just roll in shredded cheddar. Sometimes my husband will just ask me to make one for us to snack on and I’ll do a half recipe and just smoosh it into a small Tupperware container! We always serve it with Club crackers and we think they compliment the flavor best. Best recipe I’ve ever found on AllRecipes!

This is a great recipe for a cheese ball. I was looking for one without blue cheese in it for my Christmas party this past weekend. I did not get to make it for time ran out but I made it the next day. Hubby says this is a keeper. Told me to take it away or he would eat all of it. Thanks for a great recipe.(As I type this that chees ball sounds good for breakfast.)

WOW! THIS STUFF IS AWESOME! I PUT IN SOME RED COOKING WINE WHICH ADDED TO THE RICHNESS OF IT. I WAS LICKING THE EGG BEATERS LIKE THEY WERE SMOTHERED IN CAKE MIX AND EATING THE EXCESS OUT OF THE BOWL WITH A SPOON AND MY PINKY. I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT WAIT TO SERVE THIS AS AN APPETIZER ON THANKSGIVING! I IMAGINE I WON'T BE THE ONLY PERSON RAVING!

I was able to test this recipie on two different sets of people. One ball I took to work with me, the other to a July 4th picnic. Both sets absolutley love it! There was no leftovers to carry home with this cheese ball! I used the dry cheese mix, but changed nothing else. Thanks for a new "favorite" recipie of mine.

This is an excellent recipe!  However, I put in the required amount of green onion and it was overpowering...I suggest cutting way back on that.  Also, next time I prepare this recipe, I'll cut it in half...it made two large cheese logs....more than I needed.

Excellent! I assumed a cheese ball was a cheese ball.  I've made a few before.  By far this was the best.  I followed the recipe almost exact, (I used 1/2 the onion, not my favorite) and it was sooo good! thanx!

I used this as a spread (minus the nuts) and it really did not have the great flavor I was expecting.  I am thinking I may add a little something next time to "spice it up" but am not sure what.

This is really yummy, I added about 3 crushed up bacon slices, I had halved the recipe though.  It is for a party tommorow, we'll see what everyone else thinks then.

This is very good, I added alittle more onion and powder cheese and everyone just raved. The longer it sits  the  better it is.

This recipe is fabulous! I needed to make a cheese ball for a friend's baby shower this weekend and was a little nervous because I had never made one before. It was very easy and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! Thanks Natalie!

This recipe is great! Instead of making a cheese ball I use it as a dip with wheat thin crackers.

The butter just adds to the fat content, but no much to the flavor.  The 2nd time I made this, I added 1 small jar of pimento drained, substituted one of the plain cream cheeses for Philadelphia chive/onion cream cheese and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and I always use FRESH parsley.

Really, really good!  I made it just as written, but minus the walnuts since I was shaping it into a pumpkin.  I made it early in the day so it would firm up and then molded it with my fingers to resemble an heirloom style pumpkin.  Stuck a thick braided pretzel (not a pretzel rod) in for the stem and a tendril of grape vine to finish the look.  Everyone raved about it!
