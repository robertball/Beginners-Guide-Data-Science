I recently made this dish and oh my goodness was it a winner with the whole family including my neighbors.  I did make changes only because my family is not too fond of blue cheese so I substituted the dressing with ranch since when we eat chicken wings we eat them with ranch.  These were such a hit that I made them the very next day and will be making them as an appetizer for Super Bowl.  I will be making tons!!!!!! Everyone should at least try this recipe out if you love chicken wings and nachos you will definitely love this recipe!!!! Thank you for sharing this deliciousness with all of us I will definitely continue making these for the whole family  and friends.

WOW, this was such a unique take on nacho's...this coming from someone who loves everything "buffalo"!   I did not use the bacon, or the blue cheese dressing,  Instead I used ranch dressing with gorgonzola crumbles.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written.  I, like many others, feel it is unfair to judge a recipe based on YOUR version of it.  I would give this five stars, but DH gave it a big thumbs down.  And, I had heartburn (which I thought was totally worth it).  I probably won't make this recipe again, because hubby didn't like it, but seriously, I could probably eat it a couple of times per month!

Best nachos EVER!!! Did not use jalapeños, because we can't handle the heat, and didn't think it needed the butter, but otherwise the same.  Can't recommend too highly!

This was so good. As another mentioned, I substituted blue cheese with ranch and was very pleased.  I added fresh jalapenos because I really wanted a fresh kick.  The meat was so tasty and it was just enough kick to make your nose run without burning your mouth.  I would definitely make this again.  It was a real hit at the super bowl party!

These were so awesome, we did not even berate ourselves for the billion  calories we consumed. Totally worth it. Better than any nachos we have eaten in restaurants.

We loved this recipe! We like spicy food and didn't think this was very spicy, so next time I might choose something hotter than Frank's or add more jalapeños. Chips weren't soggy like I thought they'd be, but we addded the tomatoes on top after the baking.

The chips were chewy and flimsy when I would have preferred they stay crunchy, but this tastes SO good I did not mind having to eat my nachos with a fork and kept going back for more. ;)

Everyone loved this.  I mixed the chicken with  a bit of FF mayo and sour cream and some crumbled blue cheese instead of using the dressing. Eliminated the bacon to save fat calories. Also, no butter and made 1/3 of it using plain corn tortillas instead of tortilla chips. Used ff and reduced fat cheese. Reduced the jalapenos, since my family doesn't like things too spicy. Disappeared. Will make again.

Will definitely make again. I added black beans. Bacon gave it a great flavor. I just used Hormel Bacon Pieces and toasted them a bit before putting them on. I also used some Velveeta cheese mixed in.

Bacon made it way too salty and wiped out protein flavor, would eliminate it.  Instead of blue cheese drizzle at end, would do sour cream.

Was very spicy, loved it.  Chips got a bit soggy though, may go with less tomato next time.  Substituted black olives for green and red peppers.
