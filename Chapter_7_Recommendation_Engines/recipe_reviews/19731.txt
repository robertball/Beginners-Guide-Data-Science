I am a huge alligator fan, and these meatballs were really good. Also, if you're not in a place to run out and buy some gator meat, www.allamericangator.com is a great place to order it.

My husband and son go gator hunting every few yrs. so this was a perfect recipe to try for us. The meat balls came out fantastic. I used the spices but added some cajun spice as well, and I only had dried parsley but it worked out fine. I made several meat balls ,and I used some of the meat mixture and formed into patties, coated in the cracker meal and fried in a little oil in a skillet. Made excellent burgers with homemade hot mustard. mmmmm... will be making these again for sure. Thanks so much!

Friends thought the taste was spot on and gave the flavor a 5.  Said it was like crab cakes. .  And they thought the shape should have been like a crab cake and eaten with a fork - as I shaped the balls they were not firm like a meatball. Several fell apart as I tried to fry them.  They also fell apart if you tried to spear it with a fork or toothpick.  I did scale to use 1 pound of gator (found in the freezer section at Marsh grocery next to the frozen fish for $7.99) so I could have been off somthing. . . I just couldn't get past the smell - even the whole house stunk.

My grandson suggested we try this recipe and we  added some Adobe seasoning, paprika, flour to soak up some of the juice,also gave it a bit of kick with jalape√±o juice and  instead of cracked flour we used butter crackers ground up! Excellent!!!! I ordered the alligator meat on line!
