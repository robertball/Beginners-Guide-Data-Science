I made this and added a little cumin and parsley.  They whole family loved it.  They had no clue they were eating heart and liver!! I canâ€™t wait to get another deer to make this again.

This is the first time rating a recipe.... My son shot a young fawn this fall. We made this for NewYears Day party and it was fabulous. I added more liver than the recipe called for ,just to use it all up and also added a pound of ground beef. Also added some ground cardamom  and served up with cranberry sauce. This was a hit at our party and was eaten in 5 min by most of the guests. And the liver is very high in vitamin k for a super healthy dish!

A very simple recipe with a lot of flavor. I will definitely make it again and add other vegetables. I added some carrots to the potatoes and didn't use any pork. This tasted much better as leftovers the next day! It was not a heavy meal, which was my favorite aspect of this recipe. I did drizzle a little avocado oil over the top to help keep the ground venison from getting too dry which did work out.
