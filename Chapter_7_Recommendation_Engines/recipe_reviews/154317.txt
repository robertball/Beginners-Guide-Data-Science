ALERT - their must be a typo in the recipe, should only be one 10 oz box of frozen spinach.  Otherwise, GREAT dinner.  I used a pre-made pie crust (thawed overnight in fridge) and barely fit the mix with just one box of spinach included (two boxes would have been crazy).  Very filling and yummy

this was really good... I didn't have spinach on hand, but I did have chopped broccoli which made a wonderful substitution.

This turned out tasty with some modifications. I added about a cup of mashed butternut squash to add more veg. Ended up using 3 eggs to boost the protein some more. I put the ground beef and veg mixture into the bottom of the pie pan, sprinkled the cheese, and poured on the eggs and milk. I added the seasonings in and added some red pepper too, into the meat mixture while it was cooing.Also forgot to prebake the crust, but it turned out fine baking @ 375 for 1 hour.  Overall, really yummy. I am just awful at following a recipe as written. ;)

I made a recipe based on this yesterday, and it turned out to be quite delicious!   I used ground breakfast sausage in place of the hamburger, 1c onion, and fresh spinach in place of frozen.  After browning the sausage & onions, i put the spinach into the pan & covered it for it all to steam until the spinach wilted.  Drain it well!  The sausage I used was incredibly lean and didn't make any grease, so i added a tbsp of bacon drippings to the pan before adding sausage and onion.    I had a deep baking dish and smaller eggs fresh from a farm, so I used 6 eggs and 1 1/2 c. milk.  Left out the nutmeg, but added shredded grana padano cheese (can use parmesan instead) into the mix.    Topped it with shredded Colby instead of cheddar.  It was incredibly good.  My husband called it the best quiche he's ever had!

I am the poster of this recipe. There is no typo on the two boxes of spinach. It fits! :) Also, my recipe calls for Heavy Whipping Cream (not Heavy Cream). For some reason, Allrecipes changed the directions I submitted. There is no need to chill the crust when it's coming out of the freezer, and no need to mess around with foil and pie weights (completely unnecessary). Follow these instructions, and you'll end up with a hearty, delicious, comfort food meal: Heat oven to 350. Prick pie shell with fork and bake for a few minutes to firm the crust. Brown beef and onion. Drain off fat. Squeeze spinach to remove moisture. Mix with beef and onion. Beat eggs. Add cream and spices. Combine this mixture with beef mixture. Pour into the baked pie shell. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake about 25 minutes until filling is set. (It takes longer in my oven. I loosely cover with foil to prevent the cheese and crust from burning for those first 25 minutes, and then bake it another 10 minutes or so uncovered to get everything nicely browned.) Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. (We never wait that long.) :)

Very hearty meal, that's for sure.  I added some chopped orange pepper just to add more veggies, and I used goat cheese instead of cheddar.  I didn't put in as much spinach as called for--it really is a lot just with one package, trust me!  If this had ham in it, it really would be green eggs and ham!  The submitter is correct--this really isn't a true quiche, but that's okay.  Very similar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this without the crust to keep it low carb. Itâ€™s a good, solid recipe. Not fancy or outstanding, but it does give you a different option for hamburger than the usual standbys. I added 2 additional eggs and baked it in a greased pie plate. It is worthy of keeping it in my favorites for future use!

DELISH !!  Not having the ground beef, I used 8 leftover large meatballs coated with sauce, diced into cubes instead, and stirred the 1 cup of cheese into the egg mixture.  I only covered the pie crust with 2 layers of foil, and put it into the oven for 10 minutes total, before adding the egg/meat/spinach/cheese filling.  I had no weights or beans. This quiche was SOOOO good.  Will definately make this again!

Really good! Used a frozen tender flake pastry crust, pre baking as per instructions. I found I had a good full cup of filling too much for it. I just microwaved the excess filling and had a preview of what was to come. Delicious! When I made it a second time, I added about a tsp. of MSG to the mix. Even better! Yummy.

I made this and changed two things, I added double the nutmeg and two more eggs. I would suggest adding more spices or a sharper stronger cheese. I will make this again.

Love it! I used 1 box spinach and 3 eggs. Half made and discovered I had no milk of any kind but canned milk. So I diluted it a bit and the quiche was great. Also I did not precook the crust and it was perfect.

The poster of this recipe is correct.  I made this pretty much exactly as  posted. The  two 10 oz. boxes of spinach DO fit. In a deep dish pie crust. This is more like a spinach beef pie rather than a quiche. The eggs and cream are not so obvious in the end result. That's okay because it's yummy!  I eat ALOT of vegetables so maybe that's why I like it so much:) You need to like spinach in order to like this. I wouldn't make this for my husband because he doesn't really like cooked spinach. But he is in the military and isn't here right now... Ah! I almost forgot! to be totally fair I only used 12 oz. of ground beef instead of a pound. That's all that I had in the freezer.

I've been cooking for over 50 yrs. and thought I'd try this.  2 boxes of spinach is way too much, and it leaked all over--good thing I put it on a cookie sheet in the oven.  The cheese should have been sprinkled on the last 10 minutes or so--had to cover with foil to keep it from burning.  The kids didn't like it, although they love different kinds of quiche.  So much for that.
