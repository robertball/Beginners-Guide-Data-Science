Another great recipe from Corwynn. A super side dish, too! On nights when I'm in a hurry I pierce the whole squash with a knife and microwave for 3 minutes. This makes it easier to halve and seed. Then I place it cut side down and microwave it for about 4 more minutes, then finish with the brown sugar and butter in the oven. Yummy!

I made this at Christmas with my ham and it was a huge hit! I did take advice from other reviewers to cut oven time (which was occupied with ham and rolls)and use the microwave. I put them in 1/2 cup water face down in microwavable dish for 8 minutes. They were already really tender. Then I baked in oven for only 20 min. Perfect!

Very yummy for something different!  I think next time I'll use a little less butter as the squash didn't soak it all up and it ended up leaking out into the pan and burning.

I made this last night and served it along with Roast Pork with Maple and Mustard Glaze (also from this site), which was an excellent combination.  I followed the recipe with the exception of decreasing the brown sugar and omitting the cinnamon.   Followed the baking times exactly which cooked them perfectly for us.  I cut mine in wedges before serving.  The hardest part of this recipe is cutting the squash in half.  LOL!  But here’s a little tip – microwave the whole squash for 2 minutes on high.  That will soften it just enough and will make it a little easier to cut in half using a large chef's knife.

This was ummmm ummmm good!  I used a little more brown sugar than the recipe called for to soak up the butter and it turned out just perfect.  My whole family loved it, even my six year old!!

Good recipe for its simplicity and dependability. I did, however, change the seasoning, only because I don't care for sugar or cinnamon on my squash. I chose more savory seasoning; a little garlic butter and a sprinkle of paprika for rich color.

Super good and easy to make. I'll have to make it again because I had a cold this time around so I didn't think I tasted it very well. Oh! I also used some pupmkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. Yummy!

I would recommend cutting back just a bit on the butter (say, only use 4-5 Tbs), but other than that it was absolutely fantastic!

Easy as can be but that's no reason not to give FIVE STARS! The PERFECT way to make acorn squash (I also use this method to make butternut squash). No need really to measure anything (that always makes me feel like a "real" cook!) & the brown sugar &/or cinnamon - sometimes I add it , sometimes I leave it out. Either way - easy & delicious!

Someone gave me an acorn squash, and I had never cooked one before in my life.  So, naturally I turned to the internet for some suggestions.  I used this recipe as a starting place; however, I prepared it a little different.  I coated the cut squash with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon.  I baked it for about an hour.  I then melted together brown sugar, maple syrup and a little more butter in a saucepan on the stove and simmered slowly for about 15 to 20 minutes.  I brushed the glaze on the acorn squash and returned it to the oven for an additional 20 minutes.  It had a very nice flavor, not too sweet or bitter.  This may be a good idea for those who do not like the orange or brandy flavors on their squash. I also made a butternut squash the same way while I was cooking the acorn squash, and presonally I like the flavor of the butternut better.

Excellent. Try adding cooked stuffing to the squash rather than cinnamon or brown sugar during the second time in the oven (for the final 20 to 30 minutes)...FANTASTIC!

Loved it!  I always cooked it only open side up and this worked so much better. I also poked holes in the flesh with a fork so help the butter and brown sugar soak in.

Love this recipe! I like to use 1/4 cup maple syrup in place of the brown sugar, but both ways are great... This really works well with butternut & buttercup squash, too.

I used this recipe to try this squash for the first time and it was fantastic! Even my grandmother who is a extremely picky eater raved on how great it taste. A good recipe to introduce squash to a picky eater.

This was a very good side dish.  I cut the recipe in half because it was only hubby and I eating.  Followed the recipe to a "T".  It is a little sweet for me, but the overall recipe was tasty.

I did not care for this recipe.  To my husband and I it tasted just like apple sauce, and as we are not huge apple fans, it was not something we cook again.

In the hole of the squash I scooped out, I put (real) butter and sprinkle w/cinnamon and nutmeg.  I bake it at 350, covered, cut side up.  After 30 min, turn it over and let it cook in the juices and baste occasionally.  Absolutely delicious!

The acorn squash was cooked to perfection. I add already cooked, (I cook the sausage while the squash is cooking cut side down) ground breakfast sausage when the squash is baking cut side up. I also add brown sugar or maple syrup, depending on my flavor mood (Grin), and butter. I have, as a vegetarian, used the Morning Star Breakfast Patties. For me they're a little harsh, so the brown sugar or maple syrup are needed. I use a meat tenderizer (physically pounding, not sprinkling on:)to take them out of the patty shape and place the already cooked patty pieces inside the squash.  Tonight I'm going to try the Trader Joe's Breakfast Patties to compare the two flavors. All you non-veggies just use the ground breakfast sausage you like the best. Tonight I have a salad to serve with the acorn squash. I am excited and it's getting late, so happy cooking!

The only other thing I could add is ... try to sprinkle the top of the halves with either cinnamon or nutmeg before baking. It adds a great flavor that enhances the brown sugar and butter.

This was a great starting recipe!! It would've gotten 5 stars but I modified it. I only used 2 Tbls of butter and 2Tbls of brown sugar and that was plenty sweet.I did this for only 1 acorn squash. I mixed the ingredients and microwaved them for about 20 secs and put 1/2 of mixture in each 1/2 of squash before baking the last 20 min. My husband mowed on this and asked for 2nds and he's really not a fan of acorn squash. Oh yeah and I also added about a 1/4 cup of chopped pecans... it felt like the 1st day of fall today and this was the perfect side dish... thx Corwynn!!!

I've never really made acorn squash before, but these turned out great. Only difference I did was add chopped apple to the centres and baked longer. I then scooped it all out and mashed it a bit. My 5 year old gobbled it up. Great way to get kids to eat squash!

We made ths for dinner tonight. My husband actually  cut the squash in 4ths, because the squash we had was so big! my husband put butter inside the squash & wrapped them in aluminum foil & put them on the grill. After about 30 min. he opened up the foil & sprinkled the brown sugar & cinnamon. Put it back on the grill for 15 min. or so & when we opened the foil up, the squash just fell off the shell! So good! We had grilled chicken & homemade applesauce with it~

The classic preparation of this squash, and was glad to find it here (with cinnamon!). Needed more cooking than the initial 30 minutes, so be sure to get them tender!

I've made this a few times and it's always great. I've also used a high quality locally made maple syrup in place of the brown sugar cutting the butter down to a tsp or so per half, awesome.

I used the suggestion to cook in the microwave first.  I put it cut side down in a little water for 8 minutes.  Then I baked it for 30 minutes to get it done enough.  To make it healthier I used Organic Smart Balance (or Earth Balance) instead of butter.  I also used Whey Low Sugar for Diabetics and it turned out great. My husband loved it.

I found that if I break up the meat with a fork and then add the butter and spices, that it soaks through the whole squash better. And my 17 month old son LOVED it. A good way to get veggies in them.

I just made a couple of low cal changes for the weight concious.... I rubbed each half of the acorn squash with a little bit of country crock. Then a sprinkled (just enough to lightly coat) a premade mixture of cinnamon and sugar over the top. Baked and ate..delish!!

Great, classic recipe! I only gave it four stars because I really loved Maggie's suggestion about microwaving! Will definitely make again.

I never liked squash as a child, but someone made it for me similar to this recipe and changed my mind.  I was happy to find this recipe and it didn't dissapoint.  Quick and easy!

My whole family loves this recipe for squash - it's the only way my daughter will eat it. I don't add the salt and pepper, either, and it tastes great!

I have been making acorn squash like this for years.  I don't add the salt and pepper though because I don't think it needs it.  Remember to lightly mash the acorn after it is done cooking so everything gets mixed together.  My daughter loves squash like this and begs for me to make it.

Excellent and so simple to make! The acorn squash I used seemed pretty small so I cut back on the amount of butter, sugar, and cinnamon. I scored inside of both squash halves too. Before putting back in the oven, I spooned a little of the butter, sugar, and cinnamon all over top and sides. I thought it might be too sweet for us, but it was perfect for us newbies to acorn squash. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum soooo good!!!! The only thing I did to speed up the cooking process at the beginning is that I added a little water at the bottom of my baking dish and covered it with foil. After 10 mins I removed the foil and emptied out the remaining water. Really loved this recipe and so did the family.

We liked it. Though my husband was late coming home from work and I had to keep it warm for over an hour so it was a bit too soft by the time I served it. Not the recipes fault. I will try it again soon.

Great and simple recipe.  I added a small amount of water to the bottom of my glass dish before putting it into the oven, to help from burning or sticking. I followed the recipe for one half of the squash, and the other half I left off the brown sugar, because the squash is already so yummy. The brown sugar half was just like dessert!

Great recipe!  My husband loves it too and he's a picky eater when it comes to veggies!  I definitely have to be creative to get  him to eat them. Have used the recipe for a few years now adjusting it only slightly. I put the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in a saucepan, bring it to a simmer, stirring constantly until it dissolves the suger and becomes a syrup. Maybe about 5 minutes, but, don't let it get too thick or you'll have candy. Then I just pour an equal amount into each half after I turn them cut side up and spread it all over with the back of a spoon leaving the extra in the middle. Continue baking per recipe. I do the brown sugar and cinnamon by taste now, so you may want to adjust. Still use the same amount of butter though. Adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to the ingredients when cooking the syrup for baking candied sweet potatoes is good too. I also add pineapple tidbits and chopped pecans to the sweet potatoes.

I made one half of the squash according to the recipe. The other half I used allspice instead of cinnamon, just to compare. They were both great.

This is the way I've baked acorn squash forever, and the same as my mother before me. The BIG change here was the addition of cinnamon. This was a vast improvement on the dish before cinnamon and I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.  Since I had a rack of lamb in the oven, I started the squash upside down in the microwave for about ten minutes on high, but followed the recipe exactly from there on. It was fragrant and delicious. With squash readily available, I'm sure we'll have this Fall dish frequently.

I used more cinnamon so it looks burned in my pic but it's not.  I had a large squash so it took another 20 mins to cook it.  Really good though!!  The texture reminds me of spaghetti squash but finer strands.

Didn't make a single change to one half of it. I left the other half without sugar and let my husband doctor it up the way he likes. He's avoiding sugar so it was salt/pepper/parm cheese. It all smelled amazing and I really enjoy how simple it all came together!

This is a tried and true good recipe.  It's the way my mom has always made acorn squash, and it's the way I made it until I started to venture out with some new recipes. I don't measure the butter--just fill it with dotted butter to your liking; some squash are so much bigger than others, so you need to adjust all ingredients for that fact. I love the way the brown sugar and butter make a sticky syrup in the middle that you fold into the cook squash. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and yum!

Pretty good.  I've never had this before, so wasn't sure what I was expecting, but bf has, and he requested it.  So I dutifully found a recipe that he approved, and he really liked this.  He complained there wasn't enough sugar but I cut it back bc you can always add more but if it's too sweet it's a problem.  I just sprinked a handful over all, and added a bit more later at the table.  I also cut back on the butter--it really does pool in the center, and so I'm glad I put in less.  Very easy method, though, and a nice intro to my first time making acorn squash.  Thanks for the recipe!

love it and so easy to make. Since we have 200 acorn squash right now, we needed something to use at least a few of them! Thanks for posting the recipe

I love squash!!  However none of my 3 kiddos liked it much even though they ate the jarred stuff as babies... such a bummer... dont know if the husband will either but oh well.  More for the mamma!!!  I loved it!!!!

The husband still daydreams about this recipe after I made it the first time.  I reduced the butter as others had suggested (to cut on fat) however; my husband would have preferred more.  :)  Either way a keeper!

Loved this recipe! It is so nice to have alternatives to potato, and squash is it for me.

This is easy and simple and to make, plus you already have most of the ingredients on hand.  If you want to cut back on time do the first baking session in the microwave.  I loved it with the cinnomon

Very yummy! This was a great recipe because it had everything I had on hand. I didn't have to purchase anything unique or hard to find. I used a bit less butter but it still turned out very good!
