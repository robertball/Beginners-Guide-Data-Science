Fabulous!!! This frosting is out of this world! The cinnamon and the ancho chile pepper & cayenne really set eachother off. I doubled the vanilla (I do in every recipe), but didn't change anything else. For people worried about it being too spicy as written, don't fret. I can't handle spice at all, but had no problem with this frosting. Absolutely fantastic; a must try. Used this on the submitter's cupcake recipe, Cinco de Chili Chocolate Cupcakes with Chili Cream Cheese Frosting. Thanks!!! :)

This is delicious! I kind of had to play around with it since I didn't have ancho chilis and I wanted a bit more spice, but that's just my personal preference. The idea of this sounds a bit odd, but is genius. It's very tasty. I used to to frost chocolate pumpkin cake form this site, and I must use it on more baked goods now (or even by itself). Yum!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! I need to confess that I was totally eating this right from the spoon and loved every bite of it, lol. The flavor of this icing is fantastic and it really compliments the chili chocolate cupcakes perfectly, though I do believe that this icing would be fantastic on a variety of cakes. I did end up having to add more powdered sugar than called for just to get it to the right piping consistancy. I will definately be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this frosting with bacon cupcakes.  The family was a bit hesitant at first, but they loved it!  I did add just a bit more cayenne as my family likes more heat, but it was great!

This was fantastic! I used this frosting on my pumkin cake III from this site and it was delicious. The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice. Perfect! Thanx Candice.

I altered this a bit more by using more cream cheese.  I would also use a bit more chile pepper and cayenne next time for a bit more zing.

I just loved this frosting and the person who I made the cake for just loves chili and was so happy to eat this. I added a little more spice to personal preference and used it on the black magic cake from this site. We were seriously eating this with teaspoons.

LOVE this frosting!  The teachers who first tasted this with the chocolate cupcakes requested this frosting with pumpkin cupcakes.  So of course I had to make that for them.  It's perfect with Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes from this site.  Or with any other kind of cupcake for that matter.  When I know that this will mainly be eaten by those who like a zing to their sweets, I'll add more cayenne!  And maybe just a little ground ginger, too.  It's perfect!  Thanks, Candice, for making me look like a superstar!

As the author of this recipe, I was a little bit timid about the amount of chili powders. I was requested to up both the Ancho and Cayenne pepper powder and I think I like it a tad bit spicer. Who knew? I did NOT up the cinnamon. This cupcake is just good!

Let me start off saying that this is my first ever review even though I've used Allrecipes for nearly a decade now. I know- shame on me. This frosting is so good even with my forced alteration ( I couldn't find my ancho chile powder so I used chipotle pepper). Don't let the spices deter you! This recipe is fabulous and is not too spicy as written. I was worried that we wouldn't like it or that it would be too spicy so I made half with and half without the spices. I wish I would have made it all with the spices! Thank you for this AMAZING frosting!!!

I bumped it up a notch with more cayenne and a homegrown blend (of hot peppers), but the sweetness balanced it out beautifully. with just a little kick in the back.

This is a really simple & yummy recipe! I found that I had to bake mine for 45-ish minutes instead of the recommended 20-25 minutes. Turned out beautifully.  I also topped it with a spicy cream cheese icing.  DELISH!

This chili cream cheese frosting is just yummy! My boyfriend likes savory food so I couldnâ€™t wait to try this and it was a big hit. My only change was add an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. On chocolate cake it was delightful.

Awesome...I wanted just a touch more kick so I sprinkled some of the chili pepper on top of my cupcakes after I put the final frosting on top.  I didn't have time to make the accompanying cupcakes from Candice so I ended up using boxed red velvet cupcakes and the pair were a great match.

Very good on chocolate cupcakes!  But for the life of me I can not find ancho chiles pepper anywhere.  I used chipotle chile pepper, but someday I would like to try the recipe as it is written.
