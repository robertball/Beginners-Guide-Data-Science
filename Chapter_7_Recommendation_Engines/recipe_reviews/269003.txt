Really easy and delicious. Added mushrooms with the milk/ garlic combo. Next time will add some chicken broth to thin it out a little. Will make again!

I used vanilla almond milk in stead of normal milk bc that is all I had so I tweaked a couple THI. Surprisingly, it was still delicious

Wasn't overly impressed with this.  My stovetop cooks fast so I had to add more milk and cook it longer.  It was just ok.

This is a great way to only use one pan! The garlic and Italian seasoning added a nice touch to the sauce. I didn't have cream but I didn't miss it. I also added a little chicken broth and garlic powder not garlic salt to adjust the sodium. Really a lower fat version without butter or cream. It was great.

The minute I saw this recipe, I envisioned it with shrimp. I did my shrimp version and it was delicious!

Tasty, quick, and easy.  Fills you up and feeds a crowd. Its only downfall is it is very rich and tastes a bit fatty.

I added an extra cup of water to the milk, because there wasn't enough liquid and I wanted more sauce.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes to the chicken while it was cooking, for a little extra zip.  Otherwise, the basics are really good and this recipe is a keeper!

This made a wonderful dish that we both enjoyed.   The only change made was to use rotisserie chicken that I shredded.   Might change it up a bit in the future because I will definitely make it again.
