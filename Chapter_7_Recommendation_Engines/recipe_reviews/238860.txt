Very delicious recipe. I changed a cuople of ingredients due to intolerance but followed the directions. Make sure not to overcook as it will become bitter tasting. The granola will crisp up while cooling. Thank you Jiri for sharing your recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe! My very picky husband loves it and everyone else who tries it says it's the best granola they've ever had. I've made it at least a dozen times. I've substituted a teaspoon of vanilla extract for vanilla bean when necessary, and it's still delicious. Personally I think the flavors are better enhanced when served with milk rather than yogurt. Besides the vanilla extract substitution I stick to the recipe exactly. Local honey is important.

So good, thank you! Because by children are under 2 I used maple syrup instead of honey.

I've been making granola with a variety of ingredients for years but never considered adding buckwheat. I thought uncooked kasha might be too crunchy, but it was a nice addition to the granola. I am going to try not chopping it next time, mostly just to save a step. I intentionally reduced the amount of honey and forgot to add the vanilla, and it turned out fine.  I also substitute canola oil for the coconut oil just to avoid the saturated fat in coconut oil.Thanks for expanding my granola repetoire!
