I have been searching for THE General Tso (Tao) Chicken recipe, and have tried numerous recipes to no avail. This one still was not quite it, but with some changes it was the closest I've come yet. I'd give it a 5, but I had to modify the recipe significantly - still though, the results were DELICIOUS. Perhaps it isn't fair to take off a star if I didn't even follow the recipe exactly, but I wanted to avoid the negative results other reviewers had.  Here are my changes: reduce vinegar to 3 Tbsp and ketchup to 2 Tbsp, to get rid of the sour and ketchupy tastes. Reduce ginger to about 1 Tbsp (that's just personal preference) and add a couple of cloves of garlic (this is the first General Tso's chicken recipe I've seen that didn't have garlic). Increase soy sauce to 1/4 cup. Add 1/4 cup of sherry. And I like it hot, so I added a Tbsp or so crushed red pepper and a few red chiles. Also, the oyster sauce is important - don't skip that ingredient. I stir-fried broccoli and sugar snap peas with the green onions and served on white rice.  Like I said it still wasn't exactly restaurant quality but it was very close. My gf and I were VERY happy with how it turned out. EDIT: To the people complaining about the batter - I've found the chicken is better baked and MUCH EASIER. Marinate for ~3 hrs in sriracha, soy, and garlic powder. Bake covered for 10 minutes at 400, then another 15-20 at 350. Don't let it get too dry. This can result in a lot of extra sauce, so make plenty of rice.

Oh My Gosh! I love this recipe. I followed RDean's ideas and changed things like him/her. I added 1/2 bag of frozen broccoli and 1can of sliced waterchestnuts. RDean said to use 2tbs of crushed red peppers. I used just one tbs and I think I will cut it back to 1/2. If you can't find RDean, here are the changes that he/she made.  1 tbs ground ginger.(I used 2Tbs) 3 tbs of distilled white vinegar. 1/4 cup of soy sauce. 2tbs of Ketchup.  Added 2 cloves garlic.  I am going to make some changes the next time I make it. I'm going to try it without any of the breading. I hope that will make it more saucy and not so thick. I didn't mind how thick it was, just prefer more sauce and less breading.  I feel the fresh ginger and the oyster sauce are the key to this recipe! My family loved it!!

This took a long time to make and it is not even close to General Tao chicken. The sauce is sour and the taste of ketchup is too strong. Will not make again. However, the breaded chicken taste pretty good by itself. I will never again make the sauce but I will definitely make the breaded chicken again.

Followed the recipe exactly. I've got to say, I'm a little puzzled.  I'm a huge fan of the restaurant versions of this dish I've had.  This tastes nothing like them.  The texture of the chicken is wrong, the sauce is okay but the flavor is really off.  The ketchup is a bit overwhelming and seems really out of place. I cook a lot but I don't see any way to reconcile this recipe to General Tao Chicken. In the future I will stay with a traditional recipe with traditional ingredients.

This tasted great!  Definitely took way longer than 50min... but perhaps that's because I'm new to the recipe. 

Made a few changes based on recommendations.  
-Added a can of water chestnuts.
-Steamed frozen broccoli and added it afterwards.
-Used 1 tablespoon and a half of fresh ginger
-Used just over 3 tablespoons of vinegar
-Used 2 heaping tablespoons of ketchup.
-Added 3 teaspoons of fresh garlic

Tasted great with Basmati Rice.  Will definitely make again!

This was delicious!!! I put the sauce in a side dish because I knew my little kids wouldn't try it with the sauce.  But the pieces of chicken on their own were super yummy as well and the kids couldn't have enough of them.  Will make again and again... Oh yeah, there were a few items I didn't have like the green onion which I used yellow, the peanut oil and oyster sauce.  I imagine it would make the sauce even better.

Really good.  I didn't have oyster sauce and substituted purple onion for the green.  Also added freshly chopped garlic.  Would recommend adding the chicken only when the oil is very hot to obtain maximum crispiness.  Next time would try adding whole chili peppers and fresh stir-fried vegetables (broccoli, peppers, onion) for an added bit of healthiness.

This was absolutely, positively the MOST AUTHENTIC Chinese General Tso we have ever had. EVER. it is definitely a LOT of work and even though the recipes didn't say to prepare the sauce ahead of time, if we didnt it would have been a disaster. This is a two person job, honestly. I am  very experienced in the kitchen and multitask like a mad woman ( i have 4 teens who always need to be in 4 different places at the same time, ha).
This recipes really is worth the work. Please don't be too discouraged that it's a real task. I would never try it on a weeknight unless i had help.
We did have to make a few simple alterations; the sauce calls for cornstarch- use half or you'll be thinning it out later. The batter is super thick 9that's why the texture and crust is so awesome, but it"s tricky to make sure every single piece of chicken is added separately or you'll have a clump of mean.  I added additional scallions/green onions near the end. that really made us feel we were at our favorite Chinese restaurant. We ate with chip sticks to enhance Chinese Night. we often dedicate a night to a certain culture just to keep it fun to eat at home. We will do this again but I may need a glass of wine to calm my nerves first. It was fantastic with authentic Chinese Beer,  Tsing Tso.

This is an excellent recipe, particularly as a base for adding either vegetables (water chestnuts, red or green pepper, broccoli) or honeyed walnuts.  Will definitely make again!
edited addition - used about 1/4 C. sugar next time and had more of a sweet-and-sour taste that I prefer.

My husband and I loved this dish.  I did most of the changes Dean did except used rice vinegar, about 5 cloves of garlic.  The chicken was so tender and it cooked perfectly.  I was alittle worried at first because it was a very wet batter but it was PERFECTION.  If I had one complaint...I would say a tad less sugar but other then that a perfect General Tao Chicken----AND even better then a restaurant.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My famly loves this and my fussy boys do not complain when I make this. I find it very authentic.  I do add one green pepper to the sauce before adding the chicken and also some green onion slivers on top before serving.  It makes it look like restaurant style.  I was leery about the oyster sauce initially but it makes it so much better.

It was my first Asian dish cooked (besides stir-fry).  It was good, but needed a good bit of rice to tone down the sweetness.  It was almost sickly sweet, but the overall flavors are wonderful.  Will try again.  I followed the recipe exactly but will find a way to cut back on the sugar.

Easy to make and turned out great. I had to substitute with fish sauce instead of oyster sauce and rice vinegar instead of white vinegar, but my husband still really enjoyed it. Good recipe.

What a surprise when I started to read your recipe... It remembered me of a recipe I saw on a grocery store website: IGA.
 I did the research and found out you almost did no change to that recipe: you doubled almost every ingredients (except for the vinegar, and you added sugar)

I did the IGA recipe for numerous time and as other said, I also had difficulties with the chicken batter that wasn't crispy enough, and effectively, the sauce has and odd after taste...

I was looking for another recipe than this one...

The sauce is great with a few adjustments. I add a teaspoon of minced garlic and a dozen dried chilies with  the tips cut off. I also pass on the ketchup. I don't use his recipe for the chicken. I don't have any deep skillets that can accommodate all the chicken at one time, plus I'm not too big on cooking with oil because it sets my smoke alarm off. Instead I make bite size pieces of "Famous Butter Chicken" (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Famous-Butter-Chicken/Detail.aspx). Besides being easier, I prefer the taste and texture of it too. This is a great sauce recipe, that can easily be adjusted to one's personal taste or idea of what General Tao's chicken should be.

This was just ok.  I found it to be way too sweet.  I could also really taste the ketchup.  If I make it again I would cut way back on the sugar and ketchup.

I've never had General Tao chicken at a Chinese restaurant, so I can't compare this to that. That being said...this dish was just scrumptious! Prep was relatively easy and quick, especially considering the complexity of the resulting flavor. I was reluctant to use the whole 1/2 cup of oil for the frying, but that amount ended up being perfect. It did require frying the chicken pieces in five batches in my 14" round-bottom wok, but that was no problem. I removed the cooked pieces to a paper towel lined bowl while doing the subsequent batches. The coating ended up being somewhat pancake-like, but with a nice, crisp exterior that didn't fall off after cooking. The chicken pieces stayed nice and moist. The sauce cooked up beautifully and stuck to the chicken as a sweet-and-sour sauce might. Oh, I did add 1 Tbsp. of red chile paste to the oyster sauce before adding that to the sauce and it was just right for us (you might want to add a little less). I think this method might do well with pork strips as well. Can hardly wait to get to a Chinese restaurant to see how close this was! Thanks, Mel, for this great recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it many times and never change a thing about the sauce. It's so delicious! The first time I made it with beef and veggies. I've added the sauce to frozen breaded shrimp, mixed veggies, and yakisoba noodles for a quick and easy dinner. This recipe will definitely be made a few times a month in my house.

This is soooo good!  If you want the restaurant version, you're going to have to suck it up and deep fry the chicken.  But this is an excellent substitute!  Others complained of the batter: it is very thick as written.  I simply added a couple Tbsp of milk to thin it out.  It made for a thinner batter that coated and cooked evenly.  I was pleased with it.  Per other reviewers, I added a quarter cup of soy sauce and sherry, 2 gloves of garlic, and reduced the vinegar to 3 Tbsp, the ketchup to 2 Tbsp, and ginger to just 1 tsp (we aren't ginger people).  The flavor was terrific.  My husband, who loves General Tso's, at first commented that the chicken wasn't as crispy as he's used to, but he came around to saying "actually, this is really good!"  Hope this helps!

Great starting point.  I cut the sugar down and it was still a bit too sweet (almost like sweet and sour chicken), I think from the oyster sauce since sugar was one of the first ingredients.  Good taste but I will add more heat and maybe just a pinch of sugar next time.  I had never been able to get the restaurant style crust though until this recipe - it def came out looking pretty good.  My husband was really impressed!

This is excellent! We love General Tso's and this is as close to some of the best we have had from a Chinese take-out. My husband loved it so much we made an ever bigger chinese feast the next night using the leftovers as one of our side dishes. I followed the recipe to a 'T' except for the green onions, which I didnt have, but will definitely add next time. Great recipe-I'm very glad to have it.

This was fabulous!   We loved the sauce, but we like a little heat so added garlic chili sauce (sambal olek) and this made it taste just like a restaurant!  Next time,  I'm going to try it with just chicken pieces unbreaded to see if it stands alone, just to cut the fat of breading and frying...  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Very easy to make and ingredients very easy to get. Tastes just like I remember it from Chinese restaurants back home in Montreal. Excellent flavour and just the right balance of sweetness and spice.

Wow I really liked this. Things I did different. I only had two chicken breasts, that was enough for two adults & a child.  The batter I did the full amounts, I suppose they could've been cut backa bit for the amount of chicken I had. The frying I did in my deep cast iron pot. used the full 1/2 cup of oil & then let the chicken drain on paper towel in my low heat oven. Now when it came to the sauce I drained off approx. half the frying oil. I didn't want to eat that much veg oil. I was heavy handed with the ginger. I did add the sesame oil. appox 1/4 cup of sugar. didn't change other amounts with the sauce, except I had oyster sauce instead of fish sauce. My daughter was able to handle the sauce too. Worth the effort, very good. next time have some broccoli & maybe some pineapple chuncks.

This was okay. I don't think it taste like take out. I followed the recipe as written since this was my first time trying it, I will definitely tweak next time. I doubled everything, I had about for pounds of CB to use. Next time I will half the sugar and ketchup. Add more ginger. I will also add whole dried chili pepper like my take out restaurant does. Maybe some cayenne for some heat. This is a keeper with changes, but anything new to do to chicken is a keeper in my book. Thanks for sharing.

Tastes great, my only mistake was not using a bigger pot to cook the chicken in. The breading kind of congealed and fell off.

I read RDeans review and therefore added garlic - was very careful with the ketchup. I loved it and my husband was crazy over it.  I followed the recipe but I didn't measure and it turned out awesome anyway. It isn't that it's a hard recipe just lots of ingredients. I think this would be good with shrimp too. Thanks for this one

Very bready. I don't know which restaurant this recipe is supposed to resemble, but I wouldn't want to eat there. And what do you get when you put ketchup in a General Tao chicken recipe? A recipe that tastes like it has ketchup in it. Should you like to find a recipe that's much closer to what a good General Tao should be, look for one that uses corn or potato flour and less egg. The recipe should also use tomato paste and molasses. Definitely not ketchup.

I could not believe I made this!! It tasted so  good. I served it with white rice. The only thing I did a little different was I put in seafood stock, I found at kroger, I could not find the sauce. Took the left overs to work the next day tasted just as good :)

This was fantastic! I had a bit of a problem with cooking the chicken in the pan, so I put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 13 minutes. Another reviewer (RDean) suggested marinating the chicken and then baking it, but I really found the coating to be delicious (I used a teaspoon and a half of cavender's seasoning instead of plain salt and pepper). Next time, I might marinate it before coating it, and then bake it. I also followed the same review suggesting extra soy sauce, adding sherry and garlic, and using a little less ketchup and vinegar.It was fantastic!

2 stars for ease/speed and four stars for taste. This recipe wasn't hard to create, but the breading and cooking of the chicken is time consuming. The flavor was quite good, but a bit salty for my tastes. Next time I'll try deep frying the chicken pieces and use a light soy sauce for the sauce.

This was fantabulous! we added carrots to ours we just precooked them in the wok then we did our sauce, and cooked our chicken last. I used rice wine vinegar instead of white since its asian and I don't have white. we ate on some steamed jasmine brown rice. this was the best GT chicken I have ever had. We will definately be using this alot!!!

Good but I probably won't make it again. It was a lot of work and not really worth it. The sauce was way too sweet. If I did make it again I would cut down the sugar, vinegar and sesame oil. The flavors were altogether too strong and it didn't taste like any general tao chicken that I've ever had.

It was pretty tasty, I added some crushed red pepper just because I like it a little more spicy. I am looking for THE General Tao's chicken recipe and unfortunately this one fell a little short.

I made it exactly except I added some chili, garlic, and sriracha to the sauce and mixed it ahead of time.  I deep fried the pieces then transferred them to a wok with the sauce simmering in it then swished it around for a few minutes.  The batter was very sticky and I was worried about how it would turn out but it was perfect.  My boyfriend said it was the best he ever had.

Excellent recipe! I followed it as best as I could with what I had in the house and had a wonderful surprise for my husband who loves General Tao chicken. It's a long process so it will have to be saved for special occasions.

I've made this serveral times and it's fantastic. Regardless if you make the chicken breaded or not, it's still fantastic. I serve it over a white rice, quinoa blend and it's to die for.

This is amazing and my husband loves it! I live in Thailand so when I saw the ingredients and how easy they'd be to get, it was a must try! Read a few other reviews and followed some tips, like adding garlic, less ketchup, a Tbs. of crushed red pepper (because we like hotter food) and a little less vinegar. Plus I cut back on the veg. oil and sugar, because you can afford to. But such an amazing dish, note (learned this living in Thailand), when they say, "HOT" it's hot, our Maid has burnt up several of our spatulas because they get their oil hot when cooking (reason I bring this up is because some people complained about the "breading," which I think if you don't cook it hot enough, fast enough, might lead to a less appealing "battered chicken.") But it is a very good dish and not too hard once you've done it, will use again!

Close but not it at all. The ketchup gave it a weird taste. I liked the batter for the chicken. It came out real good, but I will look for another sauce recipe.

Made this last night, made some changes and it was excellent.

1. Changed the Ketchup, Ketchup should not be in Chinese food;)  I replaced it with a combination of sweet Thai chili sauce and chili sauce

2. Lowered vinegar a bit

The chicken is perfect however I used a deep frier (what?? I bought one and never use it! I have to justify the expense to my wife any chance I get). I still think the sauce could use some tweaking it wasnt tangy enough, it was definitely hot enough.

Overall, I will definitely make again, this is an excellent recipe for a base to expand on.

We enjoyed it but the ginger was too strong for my hubby and for me, I wish the breading could have been a bit more crispy. I added white rice and overall with a little more sugar and deep frying the chicken, this is a definite in our household!

Pretty close to the General Tao chicken we like, but in my opinion, not quite right. I'm not sure what it is, the ginger, ketchup, or something that's missing. However, this recipe is somewhat tasty and seems to have all the basics to make this type of chicken, so I will be using it again but with changes.

This is a really yummy recipe!  I only rated it four stars as it could use a bit more flavor.  I would say some cilantro and lemon juice would zing this up considerably.  I garnished ours with Coriander (Cilantro)

Eh, it was alright. Had a little bit of a funny flavor/after taste and I didn't like the flavor the sesame oil added. I would STRONGLY recommend making the sauce separate if you are making it the first time.

This was pretty good.  I thought the sauce was a tad too sweet. Also, I tried the oven baked method and the chicken was good but I think next time I'll fry them.

This turned out great! Loved the flavor and was easy to make. I added julienned carrots (added them at the same time i added the water and vinegar) and spinach. Just make sure you add the chicken right before serving so it stay a little crispy.

Not the true flavor we were looking for.  Good as a honey BBQ kind of chicken and everyone did enjoy it.  Needs more heat and some tweaking to get that real General Tao's flavor.

Really liked this.  I read some reviews and followed them.  Cut back on sugar and ketchup added garlic.  Tossed in some sugar snap peas and carrots.  It was really good.  Some people thought it was a lot of work; it's just the frying of the chicken pieces.  Just do it in batches while you work on the rest of the recipe.  Not hard at all.

I had very high hopes for this recipe. I followed the directions to a T but somehow it did not come together for me. It did taste very oyster-ey so maybe if i cut back on that next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very good.  Wasn't spicy in the least bit so I would probably add some crushed red pepper or something to heat it up next time but overall it was a very tasty recipe.

This is a great recipe!!  I modified it by using turkey tenderloins and gluten free all purpose flour. And I had reduce the heat of my oil down to 4 on my stove dial, (maybe because it was Canola oil) and cooked the turkey until golden brown-it came out very tender. I also added cold water to just make a paste of my powdered ginger. Otherwise it all turned out great and I would make it again!

This was amazing! Tasted just like take out! It took a lot of work to make though. I think next time I'll just use a boxed breading instead of messing with the cornstarch and flour. The sauce is what makes this tho! I added a pinch more sugar and topped with sesame seeds, yum!

Wow, excellent recipe.  Better than take out!  I followed the recipe and made no changes with the exception of having about 2 1/2 pounds of chicken.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe.  I add some crushed red pepper to add some heat because we are used to General Tao Chicken being spicy.  In the future, I will reduce the ketchup because it was a bit overpowering.

I cut down on the sugar a bit just because i'm not crazy about really sweet sauces.  Besides that i stuck to the recipe.  I thought it tasted better before i added the ketchup, so next time I'll leave it out or cut it down.  Besides that, delicious!

I have to say this was amazing!  I never cooked chicken like that and I loved it.  The sauce was delicious!  I added mushrooms because I love them.  This recipie is nice because you can be creative with veggies on what to add.  Oyster sauce is a must in this dish.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit! I followed many of the adjustments made by RDean (like others on this thread) but I also substituted white wine for the water in the sauce.  I baked the chicken (using thighs instead of breasts), added steamed broccoli, and still had an abundance of the sauce.  I was very impressed with the flavor of this sauce and will use this again, going forward.  It’s really delicious!

This was very good.  It took a lot longer than I thought it would though.  Lots of prep and time cooking the chicken in batches.  The sauce was nice but  little to thick so I added more water.  I will make it again.

Ok starting point but could be better. I found it too sweet, and I prefer my general tao spicier and more complex. 

I think replacing the the sugar with Thai chili sauce as well as some sambal oelek or sriracha would give it another star.

This was a very good recipe which I followed with just a minor change. As others mentioned it lacked the heat and the garlic, so I subbed chili garlic sauce for the ketchup ( which didn't sound too Chinese to me to begin with) and it was great! It will make it spicy so adjust as desired. Also mixed all the wet ingredients together at the end instead of adding separately to save time...no real need for the extra steps.

So delicious! My boyfriend said it tasted like gourmet Chinese and my daughter requested the recipe. Looks like a lot of work, but really wasn’t. Only had to choo the chicken, green onions and ginger. The rest was measure and add.

We loooooved this. Made a few changes: used chicken thighs (stayed moist even with the high heat), doubled the black pepper, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and subbed in a red bell pepper and a jalapeño for the green onion, which I did not have on hand. Served on a bed of arborio rice. This tasted like a fresher, healthier version of General Tso's. I loved the fried crunchy flavor of the chicken and the ginger, which tempered the sweet/sour flavor. Although the ketchup came close to making the flavor a bit cloying, I think it ultimately worked well.

Very well done. On the first “go around” with a recipe, I prefer to prepare the meal exactly as the originator/chef intended. Then, start making small changes.

I intend on changing nothing about this recipe at all. I did use an air fryer for the chicken. We very seldom fry in oil now. Came out perfect. No change to the ingredients.

I've made this twice now; rating is for the original recipe which I made the first time.  For the second time making it, I made the following changes:  decrease vinegar to 3 Tbls, decrease ketchup to 2 Tbls, add 2 tsp minced garlic and add 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  With the changes, it's a five-star recipe for our family and is actually better than the Chinese takeout places we have in our city.  Delicious!

I used this recipe just for the chicken coating, and used a jarred sauce. The breading mixture was fantastic and I'll definitely use it again. If I had thrown everything in a takeout container, no one would have guessed it didn't come from our local Chinese takeout.

It was great! I put in some crushed red pepper to make it a bit spicy and it came out amazing. Definitely recommend!

Much like RDean, I had to add or substitute a few items. I used Rice vinegar 1/4 if a cup. I also found it odd that no garlic was used so I added about 1/4 of a teaspoon of minced garlic. I also used Kikioman Sriracha hot chili sauce to taste. My family likes ours hot. I didn’t have fresh chives so I used dried ones. Substitute

I come to this recipe at least once a week. Not only does it remain a family staple, but it completely knocks out the general tso recipe from several local Chinese restaurants. I love modifying this recipe to add more broccoli for added fiber and Vitamin-B. Other than that, I really don’t change anything in the recipe. We love it just the way it is.

I cheated... I made the batter (double quantity one time and single another) and added a VH sauce at the end, keeping it frying until the water in the sauce was gone. It turned out so well both times. I do hope to venture into making this recipe without cheating sometime.

I made this dish for my husband who enjoys a lot of spice. I added 1/2 tsp Red Pepper Flakes and a jalepano for his benefit. The flavor (minus the spice that is still burning my lips) was excellent.

Awesome recipe!! I love General Tsao and this came pretty close to restaurant quality. Needs a few tweaks for my personal preference though. I added an extra tsp of crushed chilli flakes and broccoli and celery.  Would cut down the sugar in half next time- sauce came out to sweet. Also, would add garlic. Took me way longer than the cooking time given - perhaps because it was my first time trying the recipe.

This recipe is the bomb.  I would not change a thing!  To all those who change almost every aspect or totally redo the recipe I say, post your own!  I have probably made this about 10 times since I found it a few months ago.  I do make double the sauce and put it into another container before adding the chicken back in just for my rice because I do love it that much!

Well I totally forgot to cornstarch the chicken before I dropped it in the batter so the breading didn't stick. Oops. Overall though , this recipe was still very good and everyone liked it. A few criticisms that got were:
1) Too sweet .
2) Too much ginger.

I'd recommend decreasing the amount of the sugar and ginger used. Otherwise, this was a good recipe.

Made a few changes since I didn't have a few ingredients. I substituted the sesame oil for The Kegs mango sesame salade dressing, didn't have fresh ginger so used the powder form, no vinegar so used mirin. I had no green onions so I skipped it. I added a bit of club house's roasted pepper and garlic mix and added a few tablespoon s of Thai's kitchen sweet red  chilli sauce. Definitely remaking this in the future.

The batter mix does not make sense...once made the batter is like soft plaster. ..not a batter...no need to coat the chicken in corn starch...I recommend getting a panko type mix (with water)...much more simple and fool/time proof.
The sauce mix is excellent..

Very easy to prepare but since the chicken breast were rather large in size, I had no need to use 2.  Made plenty to serve 5 people and leftovers for hubby's lunch.

I thought the sauce was just like in the restaurants. Even the frying of of the chicken was similar. I used chicken thighs instead of breast which is typical they use in the restaurants.

This is an alright recipe. The batter is good. It didn't get gooey and was still good the next day. The ketchup in the recipe seems out of place for an Asian dish. I'm not sure what it's for. Instead of using ketchup, I used sweet chili sauce and omitted the sugar. However, my husband and I agree that it was still missing something. Next time, I will add red pepper flakes.

I suppose recipes vary with General Tso's chicken, like anything else.  This didn't resemble it, but it was pretty good.  As another reviewer stated, the coating is quite good.  It's not especially flavorful, but the flavor of this dish should be in the sauce.  It delicate & does-the-job-well , sticks to the chicken, not to the pan.  Thanks!

I only made the sauce, as I already had chicken prepared that I wanted to use.  I found the sauce very good, and so did the family.  No, it is not authentic General Tao sauce but it is very tasty.  I did thin it with extra water but those who complained about "blobs" just don't know how to cook with cornstarch.  Nothing wrong with the recipe.

Followed the recipe and not what I expected. I think too much ginger and maybe too much oyster sauce.

I think I would opt to deep fry the chicken next time, for a more even result. I would probably cut back on the vinegar as well. It seemed much tangier than I am used to. It. Not unpleasant, just unexpected. Would have preferred a sweeter taste.

Very labor intensive. Followed the recipe to the T. Pored in the soy sauce and corn starch and it turned into 1 big glob. Scooped it out quick and saved the sauce. Had to mix the ketchup and oyster sauce in with the corn starch and soy sauce to prevent it from blobbing again when adding it to the pan. It worked fine but the sauce  had a strange twinge to it. Added some Sriracha for a little heat and flavor. It made it better but I wouldn't make again.

I've been experimenting with General Tao's Chicken for some time now and am always interested in trying any variations that will make it better.

This recipe hits on some great points. Except:

I always use garlic. Period. Two or three cloves for 2 pounds of chicken is perfect.

White vinegar? Way too acidic and no flavor profile. Use rice wine vinegar. More expensive, but well worth it.

Cooking green onions until they are soft is a bad idea. Cooking ginger until it browns...worse. Stir-fry these just until the aroma/flavor begins to release, then remove. Add back in with the chicken.

Using ketchup in Asian cooking is not a horrible idea, but one does need to cook out the ketchup flavor. Add the ketchup and oyster sauce and simmer for about five to ten minutes, then add the cornstarch-soy sauce slurry, slowly, just until the sauce thickens.

Anyone using white sugar in savory dishes misses out on the complexity that using brown sugar adds.

My wok only sees two oils, EVER. Peanut and sesame. Unless there is someone in the family with a peanut allergy, peanut oil performs much better than vegetable oil in the high heat needed for stir-fry. More expensive, but your wok and guests will thank you for it!

That said, this is not a bad place to start with this dish as someone making it for the first time.

This was good overall but needed a few modifications. Mainly I reduced the sugar by about 25% and I still found it a bit too sweet. I would reduce the sugar more next time.  I also threw in a little bit of cooking sherry and some crushed red pepper flakes. I reduced the water a little too I wanted the sauce to be a bit thicker. I added in a bit of Maggi's seasoning too, just a few dashes.

UPDATE: Made this again and reduced the sugar in half and still found it sweet. I guess the ketchup and other ingredients are adding a lot of sweetness. I can't stand it overly sugar I think a tablespoon would do.

I followed the recipe and the sauce was little too salty for my liking. Not time I will cut down on the Oyster sauce and maybe add a little brown sugar as well.  Overall, very good for a first attempt. With a little tweaking next time,  it will be fabulous!

I made this recipe today and I actually ended up adding 5 Thai hot peppers (seeds removed) and it was DEEEEElicious!! I put some sticky Asian rice under the chicken with steamed broccoli .. definitely recommend all three together. Simple but delicious! I also added an extra egg because the batter with the flour seemed very stiff .. egg yolk included. So 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg. Enjoy guys !

Very tasty! I am not a good cook, but this recipe was easy to follow.  I used what I had on hand - ground ginger instead of fresh, onion powder instead of green onion, rice vinegar instead of white - and it still came out good.  It was quick and easy, and I can see myself making this after I come home from work.

It was a great recipe and I followed it with a few changes. I substituted chicken for sliced pork, omitted the oyster sauce and added garlic cloves and sesame seeds and red pepper flakes. Finally,  I served it with white rice and stir fried broccoli and mushrooms. Everyone loved it!

I have made this a couple times now and love it. I didn't use any green onion, and substituted Oyster Sauce with Worcestershire and some more Soy Sauce. Also added some freshly minced garlic. Hoping to use some Gochujang the next time I make it in replace of some of the ketchup to give it some more heat. I also added garlic and onion powder to the batter.

The taste was a little bit different than what I am used to,  and I put too much vinegar in the sauce. But I enjoyed the overall flavor. Also the chicken was delicious  pan fried and came out nice and light.

I will definitely be making this again!! I loved the flavor and texture. I needed to make it gluten free so used gluten free all purpose flour in place of the regular all purpose flour. I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. Used 1/4 cups Truvia baking blend in place of 1/2 cup sugar. Served with broccoli and brown rice. Added 2 garlic cloves along with the ginger. Oh so good.

Pretty good.  I think less ketchup is a good idea.  Keep chicken pieces and suace separate until serving so it stays crunchy.  Batter was ok but didn't taste like restaurant General tso but overall ok flavors

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe! We pretty much followed it exactly. The only thing I did differently was add chili peppers and two cloves of garlic. It was spicy with just the right amount of sweet tangy flavor to it. We will definitely be putting this in rotation.

The only thing that was sort of a bother was grating the ginger. I blame my grater though. I need a bigger one. Besides that, it was pretty easy.

I did cut down the vinegar and ketchup. I added crushed red pepper and a little fish sause  and added little extra water and cornstarch. Oh and got to have the garlic cloves. Awesome.
Oops don't forget the broccoli fry in sesame oil and while frying sprinkle a little soy sauce on that.

This turned out well, with a few modifications as suggested by RDEAN (for the sauce, although I didn't have/use the sherry) and a change of my own. I did opt to do the batter (glad I did!), but I only used one egg and about 1/4 cup water to make up the difference, and thin it a little. The chicken coated and cooked up nicely, and the family really liked the battered chicken. Overall, a very tasty dish!

For the sauce I made a few changes: used hoisin instead of oyster sauce and didn't use any ketchup. I added a tsp of minced red chili peppers. Finished with a slight drizzle of honey.

The first part of the recipe - preparing the chicken for coating and frying - was informative. And different: I always prepared the chicken by soaking it in egg first and then rolling it in a batter mixture, usually flour. The process was reversed this time but it still worked out better than I expected.

Excellent recipe and straight forward directions.   It was  a nice sweet with just a hint of tang.   I served over white rice, but wish that I would have served over fried rice with a side of fried broccoli.

Rdean your suggestions were great. I followed them but left the same amount of vinegar but increased water to 1 cup. This recipe came out so delicious... Thanks!!!

Recipe was perfect as is! If you follow the directions and cook it properly it turns out great. Make sure you cut the chicken small and don't over cook it. It fry's up fast. Also make sure to add the proper amount of oyster sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil, this will ensure it doesn't taste "ketchupy". This is not the Spicy version that some people may be looking for. Perhaps that is why so many complain?

while i cant say that this tastes like actual general Tao's chicken, i will say that it made for a decent meal. i prepared the sauce exactly as the recipe stated and felt that it was too salty. i added hoisin sauce to sweeten it. if i make this recipe again ill likely use rice vinegar instead of regular.

Very good!  I add crushed red pepper flakes and I usually just cut the chicken up, put it in an oiled pan, cover it with the sauce and bake.  It is wonderful fried, but a little healthier baked.

@RDean I am fifteen years old and I love to cook ! I decided to make General Tso's chicken for my family and with a few tweaks it was delicious ! I followed the recipe but I also used your advice of reducing the ketchup to 2 tbsp and vinegar to 3 tbsp although I kept the ginger the same . Due to the sugar, I felt like the chicken was too sweet so I added some hot pepper. Even after that I wanted more spicy so I added about a half cup of sriaracha and it was perfect ! The chicken had a nice reddish tint and the whole family loved it . They said it was restaurant quality ! I am very satisfied :)

My kids took one bite and said, "It's just like in the restaurant!" I added broccoli and green peppers to mine, and I added a few tablespoons of sriracha to the ketchup mixture. I also added hot chili powder to give it extra kick because my family likes it spicy. I will make this again.

I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste so the rating is more of how much I liked the dish, not the recipe itself: note to whoever is not familiar with it - this is a very sweet dish. It felt basically like chicken in caramel.

I loved how the chicken came out very tender yet well cooked. Frying chicken for 12 minutes to me was a to long so did mine in batches after the coating became a nice dark brown. Saw that chillies/pepper was missing and added some jalapeños as I like my G T spicy.
A well deserved 5 star! 
PS. The small amount of leftover batter fried up very well too. Nothing was wasted - LOL.

It wasn't as hard as I expected, but most of all I can't remember a dinner that was so loved by every member of my family! Next time I am going to try to reduce the oil and sugar and see where that takes me.

I tried the recipe, followed it exactly, and it was delicious.  Most of the ingredients I had on hand and the ones I didn't weren't hard to find.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would like a little more sauce
I'm definitely going to keep this as one of my go to recipes for years to come.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

The taste of the chicken is fine but I was really confused by this recipe, it is just like frying a chicken breast and putting sauce over it. Don't care for this one, will be trying another one.

Takes longer than you think, especially if you don't make it often.  But a terrific taste, I add a bit of sriracha to take the ketchup-taste edge off it.  So good!

Added a good amount of garlic and substituted green onion with the regular purple ones..and didn't have ginger root so left that out. And substituted with pork instead, and oven baked covered ~20 min before sauteing in most of the sauce - still good!

So good and does taste close to the General Tso we get at the restaurant. I used chicken thighs and doubled the sauce but used brown sugar instead of white everything else as recipe called for. Perfect!

Not any kind of good imitation of any General Tso (not Tao) Chicken I have ever had. I took the recommendation of a poster and baked, not fried, the chicken. And got anemic looking chicken. The coating is just wrong. General Tso needs cornmeal and Panko, or it's just wrong. It wasn't a mild version; it was basically bland. So this combination of anemic, lack of crunchy outside (and tender inside), with bland, not even mentioning the lack of vegetables in this recipe, makes it a poor imitation of the real thing.

It was alright. Intense flavour, but wasn't a big fan of the flavour. I used about half the sugar because half a cup seems like way too much considering ketchup is basically just sugar as well. Also it tasted a bit too much like the oyster sauce I think.  It wasn't very crispy either but I expected that. We thought to bake it a bit at the end to try to make it crispier.

Very good. I didn't have corn starch so used corn flour and it still turned out well. Didn't have oyster sauce so didn't use it, and decreased vinegar to one tablespoon, ketchup to one tablespoon, and grated ginger to half a tablespoon. Increased soy sauce to half a cup. Didn't have sesame oil so used chili oil. I imagine the original recipe is probably better, but this was delicious even with all the omissions! BTW - it was great not to have to deep fry.

Best General Chicken I've had! I didn't have an orange to zest, so I used a splash or Orange Juice.  Also, I could not find the chili peppers, so I used Chinese Hot Sauce.  I ate it so fast I didn't take a picture.  Will definitely make again.

This was quite ambitious for me to take on alone; definitely a two-man job, especially for clean-up. Regardless, this recipe came out great after following RDean's suggestions of limiting the vinegar and ketchup (I used rice vinegar), and adding chiles (I used lots of chili paste to add needed flavor). After burning my arm and face with hot oil I decided to bake the rest of my chicken. I was concerned the breading would not bake well, but it actually did. It wasn't the best breading, and it fell off the chicken some, but it was General Tso Chicken for sure. Overall, not worth the work.

Very good. I used rice vinegar because it is not as harsh I find. Even though I cut back on the vinegar and ketchup, next time I would cut back to only a tablespoon of vinegar and a lot less soy sauce as well. My husband is Singapore Chinese and he always says the recipes call for way too much soy sauce. But this was very close to restaurant style. You need to fry it twice in a deep fryer to get it to come out like the restaurants. This is healthier.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I did make it the way RDean suggested. My mother and I love General Tso's chicken for a long time and don't eat it too often. Last night we made this together and even my husband enjoyed it. My kids liked the chicken without the sauce. I would definitely make this again, but make sure you have time because it did take me a long time to prepare, even with help.

I made no modifications and I really liked this recipe. I can't say for certain whether it really has that "General Tso's" taste since it's not a dish that I typically order; but this tastes really good. I will admit that I eyeball most everything (vs. make exact measurements), but I don't think that will make much of a difference here.

Tried this recipe exactly like it read. The first bite was so so, but the more I ate, the more I liked it. My hubby gave it a 10.  I served with rice. Didn't taste exactly like our Chinese Restaurant made, but was really good.. Chicken was really tender. I will definitely make it again.

I made the recipe without the sauce.. Just after frying the chicken.  My husband who is really picky. Doesn't like too many chicken recipes said He really liked this.  So it is two recipes in one,

Recently made this for my 2 teens and husband.  Everyone loved it-which is rare!  Not sure why there are any negative comments on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly as shown, just added some roasted broccoli into the chicken and sauce at the end, and served over jasmine rice.  Can't wait to make this again!!

Followed the recipe pretty much as is, though I reduced the vegetable oil by about 25% and sugar by about 50% to try to make it a bit healthier.  Tasted very good, although it probably won't become one of my go-to recipes because of the number of steps involved.

This meal is so full of flavor! I make this for my husband and I and it makes for great left overs for lunch the next day as well. We keep this on the regular menu! The oyster sauce is a must so don't leave that out! We use a little Sriracha sauce (rooster sauce) cause we like things to be spicy.

Love this. Especially the hubby. It takes me a lot longer then 50 min though. I made it the first time and followed recipe. Now when I make it i omit the oyster sauce.  I also double the sauce so I can use some on my rice.

I tried this recipe last night, we followed the recipe just as it said with the exception of cutting the ginger back to one tablespoon and adding chili sauce (my fiance and I like heat).  We added brocolli and pour it all over white rice to make it a full meal.  The recipe tasted good, but nothing like the take out we get from all of the places around here.  It had more of a peanut taste to it than anything.  I give it three stars because it tasted nothing like the General Tao chicken, but was still delicious.

This was just "okay". For being home cooked definitely not bad... but a Chinese restaurant's version is definitely much better! It had a weird twang which might of been from the ketchup. Also deep frying the chicken in the restaurants in MY opinion is a big part of the recipe. The sauce is more of what I had a problem with though... it just tasted... weird. Not horrible though! My husband ate everything on his plate... but he will also eat almost anything :-)

We just finished eating the General Tso's Chicken for dinner. I followed the recipe, almost as written, and it was super. I added a little chopped garlic, and some Chinese Chili Sauce for added heat. I tossed in some blanched broccoli at the end and served it over white rice. So, so, good!  Thank you!

I love this recipe.  It has become a family and Army Brigade favorite.  I have messed around a little with how much of an ingredient I put in but the ingredients haven't changed.  For a lower carb. recipe skip steps 2 & part of 3 just brown the chicken.

This was phenomenal!  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 starts is b/c I made a few minor changes.  As per other user's recommendations I cut back on the ketchup and vinegar.  I also added garlic and sherry to the mix.  I used Sriracha because my husband loves heat.  The changes were made simply based on personal preference.  Also, I didn't have any problems keeping the chicken "crispy".  Unlike other recipes, it didn't go all goopy when I added the chicken to the sauce.  However I made sure the chicken bits were a nice golden brown all over before I pulled them out.  I also cooked everything in an enameled cast-iron dutch oven which might have something to do with the texture holding up as well.

Super yummy tasting dish.  One of my faves from Chinese restaurant which we have to avoid due to son having a peanut allergy.  This tasted very similar.  I will probably spice it up with red pepper flakes next time and definitely leave the sauce on the side for the kids.  I did not have sesame oil or oyster sauce, but it was still very, very good!

I would but the onions in last so that the green onions don't get mushy. This has a sweet to the taste flavor and is good to eat if you have a sensitive stomach. :)

Made exactly as written but doubled the sauce  recipe since I had close to almost 3 pounds of chicken. I was able to get a knob of fresh ginger at my local supermarket for 10 cents and used all I bought. Tastes exactly like the local Chinese would make. I wouldnt change a thing. My wok had  hard time handling all the chicken, so maybe next time I would do it in batches to make it crispier.  The batter was very very thick, too thick to dump 3 pounds of chicken in, so I added a little water to make it a little thinner like waffle batter.  Made it over white rice with fresh string beans. Had plenty left over for a second meal and tastes even better the next day.  Excellent recipe, this will go into the regular rotation. Thanks.

This is really good! In fact, cooking the chicken in the cornstarch/flour/egg/baking powder mixture is the closest thing I have tried yet to restaurant style Chinese food. The reason I gave it four stars is that there is no heat in the recipe. I think next time I will add some red pepper flakes to see if that helps. It wasn't bland - in fact the ginger and onion flavor it nicely - but it is not spicy the way that General Tsao chicken usually is.

This came out wonderfully! I followed everything as listed except left out the green onions and oyster sauce, because I didn't have any in the house.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will definitely add some crushed red pepper in the future to spice it up a bit, but that's just personal preference.

Awesome!  Tastes just like the restaurant.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut back on the ketchup and vinegar and added more soy sauce.  I also added 1 Tbsp of crushed red pepper, because we prefer spicy dishes.  I served it with "Restaurant Style Fried Rice", also from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I make this very often. So much better than at a Chinese restaraunt. The only thing I do differently, is that I use popcorn chicken to make it easier. I bake the chicken in the oven according to package directions, and then I skip ahead to step 4, throwing the chicken in with everything else. Thanks for the recipe!

This had a great flavor, and would have gotten 5 stars, had the recipe as written allowed us to get the better to stick to the chicken.  We are going to need to play around with this, but thought it was good.

Everyone loved it and told me they definitely want to have that again.  I had my doubts at first with the batter.  It was thicker than what I'm used to for breading and didn't seem like nearly enough.  I went ahead and dumped it in the ziploc bag with my chicken pieces and realized a little goes a long way.  My husband added a little cayenne to his.

I agree with others that state  that it was a little to much work.  The taste was okay.  It didn't taste like any general tao chicken I ever had.  I'm used to spicy not sweet, so I added a little crushed red pepper.  Not a bad recipe at all, just not what I was expecting.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe for friends and it was a huge hit. They said it was the best they've ever had, even from a chinese restaurant! I did have to substitute a few things and add here and there. I added 2 Tbsp. of Oyster sauce that I had on hand, I used a red wine instead of the sherry because that's what I had on hand and I also used 1/3 c. more corn starch to thicken the sauce. I dissolved the corn starch in just enough water to make it not lumpy for the batter. And lastly, I added only 1 1/2 cups of sugar because I doubled the sauce recipe.

Very close to what we order at our Chinese restaurant but better. I followed the recipe for the most part except I made two changes as suggested by other reviewers. I added two tablespoons of ketchup and added about two tablespoons of pepper sauce because the General Tao chicken we get has a kick. My husband loved it. The only thing I am going to do next time is double the sauce. I also mixed in some jasmine rice into the chicken while it was cooling in the pan. It makes twice as much as you get for two orders of take out for half the price and no long waits for lukewarm food.

Very yummy! I only used 4 tbs of ketchup and added 1 tbs garlic chili sauce. Also added cayenne pepper. Next time I will double the egg, flour mixture as my last batch didn't have as much coating as the previous batches.

This recipe is good, it takes a lot of effort, but it is worth it.  I followed the advice of others and cut down on the sugar and ketchup, in fact I probably only used 2 tablespoons of ketchup and that worked fine.  I omitted the oyster sauce because I didn't have it, and everything still tasted good.  It doesn't necessarily taste restaurant quality, but getting that in any homemade chinese food it hard.  I think the only improvement that could be made is if there was some honey in the sauce, that would really taste good. I paired this with pork fried rice and it was a great meal.

AMAZING!  My hubby thought I ordered it from a high end Chinese Restaurant.  I also served it with broccoli and rice.  Since we're not big ketchup fans - I did half chili pepper sauce and half Srircha Hot Sauce it was sooo good and it really kicked it up if you like spicy food!  I made lettuce wraps as an appetizer too!

This is our favorite chinese recipe yet!! They way the chicken is coated with cornstarch, egg, etc, was such a great concept. We'll even use this was of preparing the chicken to go with other sauce in the future. It had the same "feeling" of being fried but WAY healthier! Love it.  Tasted very authentic. Don't bother to make it without the oyster sauce...it's what gives it that little "extra".

Very good, BUT nothing like any General Tao I have had at a restaurant.  The flavors were good, chicken tender and juicy, however this recipe could not be mistaken for a chinese restaurant. I will definitly make this again, maybe cut back on the sesame oil used as it was a bit strong (we eat asian meals all the time and are used to the flavors but it still seemed strong). I did do one thing different, I sauteed some broccoli with minced Garlic to serve along with this meal. I would definitly reccomend this recipe to someone, just not claim it was like a restaurant.

I was hoping it would taste like the General Tao Chicken that I would get at a little Chinese take out restaurant, but it came pretty close.  This recipe tasted a bit sweeter than the one I'm use to.  Other than that, it was good!
