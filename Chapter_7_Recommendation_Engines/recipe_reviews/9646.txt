This recipe was quick and easy to make, unfortunately it isn't worth even the few minutes it takes to make.  Before I go any furhter: I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  The walnut crust is way too thick, and just tastes dry and crunchy, not flavorful.  The "cheescake" filling is anything but, it's more like a suggestion of what cheesecake could taste like.  Lemon?  How can you taste a hint of lemon flavoring when the whole thing tastes like nuts?  This recipe was baked by me and tested by my husband and a friend.  They both hated it, but not as much as me.  I wasted my evening baking time cleaning dishes, including the one left after I threw these things away.  Sorry, they just suck.

layer or crust way too thick and not enough cream cheese. TO ALL BAKERS OF THIS RECIPE: Use at least one package of cream cheese to even out the crust, or stick to original 2 packs if you like more cheesecake then crust. Awful recipe despite that.

Like other users, I had to make a number of changes to make this recipe something we would enjoy. I increased the amount of cream cheese to a full 8 oz. package, and I was still wishing there had been more filling. I also added cinnamon to the crust/topping, and used pecans instead of walnuts. We ate them, but I'm sure that there is a better recipe out there. Sorry. :-(

I gave this 3 stars after using some changes.I used a whole package of cream cheese,so when making the crust I used about 1/4 cup of milk and a little more flour. I didn't use nuts. I put it all in a 9x1.5 inch cake pan.Push the crust VERY lightly into the pan.It would be good with strawberry sauce on top.

Everyone loved these bars. The lemon was just the right touch as well as the nutty cookie layer. Will definitely make these many more times!

This is fairly easy, but we did not love the crust and there was not enough cheesecake middle.

With some changes done, this one was a huge hit at our house. I doubled the cheesecake portion. The crust is a little bland, but goes well with the richness of the cheesecake. Quite honestly, we preferred this over the usual New York cheesecake. Easy to make, great rich texture and flavor.

I almost gave these 2 stars, but we did eat them so I guess they weren't That bad. But I also increased the amount of cream cheese and omitted the nuts from the crust. The crust was still like biting into a cracker and quite flavorless. The filling was not dense or thick like cheesecake, and I can't imagine only using the amount of cheese suggested in the recipe. Kind of a waste of ingredients - yikes. sorry.
