YUK! A lot of trouble for a really nasty cheese ball.  I couldn't give it away.  The dog ran.

This recipe is really good and very simple.  It is a nice change from the traditional cheese balls.  I also made it with taco seasoning mix and taco sauce.  It makes one large ball or two nice size cheese logs.

I didn't care for this recipe, the chili seasoning was overpowering. I took it to work for snack day and ended up throwing half of it away.

We have a luncheon at work and we all try something new. We all agreed this was very yummy! I don't have kids but I don't think they would like it because of the nuts.

This is a family and work favorite.  Everyone, everywhere eats it; however, we do not put pecans on the outside, just cheese, preferably Monterey Jack.
