I am the author of this recipe, but I need reviewers (users) to know that you can combine these same ingredients (minus the steaks) and cook over low medium heat for 10 minutes. Add 1 tablesspoon cornstarch to thicken. Simmer an additional 4 minutes. Use as a sauce
to dip steaks in while eating! OR~ I have never done it but it was suggested to me to boil the marinade that is left over for same purpose.

I loved, loved loved this marinade.  No need for steak sauce!  Because I was only marinating 4 steaks & used the zip-lock bag method, I halved all of the liquid, except the whiskey! I subbed beef broth for the water, and OJ instead of pineapple. Just a few splashes of smoke.  A recipe well done, highly recommended!

OMG!  This stuff is great.  I used Jack Daniels for the whisky and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It makes a lot of marinade.  We used NY strip steaks that were about 1 1/2" thick.  We marinated and cooked 4 steaks  However, I think this makes enough marinade for 6 or may 8 steaks.  I did marinate for right at 24 hours.  The lady at the liquor store suggested that I should also try to marinate veggies in this.  But, a word of caution from her, "only marinate for about 15 - 20 minutes!"

This marinade was unbelievable! The steaks came out so juicy and full of flavour.  At first, I was concerned as a few reviewers mentioned the whiskey taste was way too strong (and I hate whiskey).  I let it marinate for 24 hours and when I took it out of the fridge, I could really smell it (which further scared me)!  But after barbequing it... WOW, it tasted amazing.  

The only change I made was replacing pineapple juice for orange (that's all I had).

Myself nor the rest of my family (4 of us) liked this recipe. It was like an Asian style steak dumped in whiskey.The liquid smoke didn't go with the soy or teryaki flavor at all.That is mainly used with barbecue, though I can appreciate trying knew things.  With little tastes of the rest of the ingredients, mainly all that was tasted was the whiskey. Maybe you have to be a whiskey lover to enjoy this.  I was really disappointed.

What an excellent marinade!  I used chicken stock instead of water, and used 3/4 cup of whiskey on accident!  I used minced ginger instead of the teriyaki sauce, and added a bit more brown sugar.  This is definately a keeper.

I followed the recipie exactly and this is an awesome marinade!  Loved this.  My steak was flavorful and ahhhmazing!  Thanks Victoria I really enjoyed this and will be using this recipie often!  What I do is make up a batch of this marinade and place each steak in a freezer bag with this marinade, then pop in the freezer.  When ready to have one just take it out of the freezer and thaw.  Something about thawing out the meat while in the marinade really pulls it into the meat.  I do this with any of the steak marinades that I use.  This way I can have a great steak anytime!

OMG!  So awesome!  I do not like whiskey and was pleasntly surprised at the great flavor of the steaks.

I used OJ in place of the pineapple juice, doubled the garlic (we love garlic), and used onion soup mix in place of the minced onions.

We will definately make this recipie again and again!

FANTASTIC!!! This was really good, but I did make a few minor changes to it just for my preferences in the steak department. I LOVE marinating, so I let the steak marinate for a really long time. I tripled the amount of whiskey (for my benefits =]) and then added two 8 oz cartons of buttermilk and then about a cup of milk. I added 6 TBSP of salt and 5 bushles of parsley. As you can see, I was cooking for a lot of people. I then took 2 tomatoes and held them over the steak and squeased them in my fists. WOW it was so goooood. Finally I cooked it for only 2 minutes on each side and left it really really rare, so much that blood literally was squirting when I cut into my piece. DELISHHH! Try all of my changes and you will be amazed!

Simple to put together and gave excellent flavor even after 6 hours of marinating the steaks in it!  
I personalized it a bit and removed the liquid smoke (mainly because I did not have any) and added pineapple tidbits to the marinade.  Once I placed the steaks on the grill, I used about 1/2 of the marinade to baste the steaks.  This smelled so good that before grilling the steaks, I made another batch of marinade (again with pineapple added and liquid smoke removed), put it in a large saute pan on the stove, and reduced it to a thickened sauce that could be served with the steaks.  I was not sure how much flavor only 6 hours of marinating would impart, but even without the reduction on it, the steak had taken on a very nice flavor.

I have had many of those "Whiskey Marinated" steaks dining out.  Now I can now have them at home using my personally selected cuts of steak and other selected ingrediants and sides.

Steaks for dinner......................................$ 30.00
Chicken nuggets for kids ...........................$ 15.00
Bottle of wine...........................................$ 19.00
Not having to take 5 kids to a restaurant for this great steak dish.............................PRICELESS

Thanks, Victoria!

wow I am surprised by a few of the ratings. I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews, so only adjustment I made was reducing the whiskey...and I thought the taste was INCREDIBLY GOOD. I often have the jack daniel steak at Fridays, and this is a very, very close version...Thank you for the recipe!

We tried this out on our camping trip, someone gave us a bottle of Whiskey and we don't drink it, but boy howdy does it make a great marinade...now we know to do with the stuff. Steaks were juicy and a nice flavor, didn't put the water in.

Very good.  I didn't change a thing other than cutting the recipe down because I only had 4 steaks.  My audience were all hearty beef eaters, so the pressure was on.  This recipe did not disappoint.

I used this recipe with steak tips, and instead of grilling them, I actually cooked them IN the mixture, on the stove. and they were A-MAZING. Best steak tips I've ever eaten.

I didn't really like this recipe all that much.  I will admit that I substituted orange juice for the pineapple because I didn't have any in the fridge.  I also broiled my steaks rather then grilled.  Not sure if it was the substitution or the manner of cooking but no one in the family enjoyed this recipe.  To me it seemed like all you could taste was the whiskey and brown sugar.  While I do enjoy the taste of both, it didn't seem to go well on steak.

I followed the recipe almost as is, but used a little less liquid smoke.  Also used a pineapple/orange juice combo that worked well.  It turned out perfect.  We used the left over marinade and boiled it and used it as a dipping sauce.  That was fantastic.  My wife, normally not a huge sauce person, absolutely loved it.  We will definitely use this recipe again and again in the future.

This was good and easy!  We used Flank Steak instead of rib-eyes and it was just as good.  The recipe makes a ton of marinade!  I'll halve it next time.  It was too cold to grill, so I cooked it on the stove in the marinade which worked out just as well.  I didn't add liquid smoke because I don't like it.  All in all another good recipe for steaks!

Excellent flavor to a steak.....have to cook slowly, because the marinade causes flame ups.

This marinade is wonderful.  I wanted to have a romantic dinner at home with the hubby and this hit the spot.  Just as good as a restaurant steak if not better.

Fantastic marinade! We used Jack Daniels and followed the recipe, marinated ribeyes overnight and they were great! We will use this recipe over and over, and can't wait to make this one for family. Thanks

This got mixed reviews at our house.  The steak was tender but two of the four of us didn't care for the tanginess of the marinade.

Very tasty marinate, I would use this recipe again. I only marinated for 12 hour next time I will try and marinate for 24 hours to get a deeper flavor.

This was very good. it reminded me a lot of the Jack Daniel's sauce at TGIFriday's. I marinated the steaks in the sauce and then during the grilling process i simmered the sauce on the stove until it reduced and became more of a glaze and poured it over the meat to serve. the only problem was that when i did that it became very salty. i might try reducing the soy next time. other than that it was wonderful!

This was overkill on the whiskey.  Marinated for 24 hours.  Far too much flavor.  I think my previous version of worcestershire sauce and Lawrys is what Im gonna stick with.

This was fabulous! I used OJ instead of pineapple juice and onion powder and garlic powder. Also no brown sugar. I made carmelized onions and mushrooms to have with my steak and corn on the cob!  This was my favorite steak ever!! I can't wait to make it again.

Forget the liquid smoke. Cook it over a smokey grill.

I would drop the sugar completely, as there's plenty and to spare in the pineapple juice. Maybe add a tablespoon if you think the steaks won't brown without it. There's way too much whiskey in this. I'd drop the whiskey to 2 Tablespoons.

I have used this recipe for the last couple of years and family and guests love it. I use a lot more garlic and onions and use about 21/2 inch thick strip loins. I boil up marinade for a gravy. Cook steaks medium rare and cut very thin. Great with mashed potatoes. I frequently make the marinade and freeze the steaks in the marinade so they are ready to go.

Thank you for sharing this excellent and flavorful sauce/marinade!  A few comments:
- I used about 1/4 tsp liquid smoke
- I added a small amount of ground black pepper and some red pepper flakes
- next time I will omit the teriyaki sauce and just add a tsp of grated ginger (the other teriyaki components are sufficiently present in the marinade)
- I combined the ingredients in an electric blender and then smoothed, using half for sauce, half for marinade
- I deglazed with the sauce, then added heavy cream to make a whiskey cream sauce.  I also used the sauce as is.  Neither was as good as the marinated steak on its own.
- The flavor slightly overpowered the steak for my liking.  Will love to see how it works on chicken.
