I made this twice, first as written and it was GREAT!  But then I did some mild modifications.  I used all ground beef, addes red wine instead of water and added 1/2 tsp of oregano and rosemary plus 2 bay leaves.  Put it in my crock pot for 4 hours and it was OUTSTANDING!  I even had a true Italian guy tell me it was an outstanding sauce.  I served it over spaghetti.

I've never written a review for a recipe before but this recipe was worth the effort.  I made this as the recipe calls and it was fabulous.  I've been making Italian food for a long time and this sauce was truly delicious.  My Italian husband declared it the best sauce he's ever had!!

I made this just for kicks to see how other people make their sauce. This was just OK at best. First of all...there's already enough fennel seed in Italian sausage that adding more is complete overkill. And it's definitely lacking ingredients for a full, rich sauce...such as...bell pepper, mushrooms, fresh Italian basil, fresh spicy oregano, fresh parsley, and a bit of red wine. (by the way...red wine is what should be used instead of sugar) Also...1/8 to 1/4 cup olive oil in your sauce will keep it from coagulating and also makes it a healthier recipe. A couple pinches of black pepper and fresh thyme sprinkled on the sauce when served finishes it off.

Awesome meat sauce!!!  I sauteed the beef and sausage separately as they tend to be greasy and added them to the sauce during the last half hour of cooking.  I then sauteed the onion with a little olive oil and garlic until translucent.  I then added the tomatoes and spices.  I used red wine vs. water, added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes, doubled the basil, added 2 tsp. of oregano, and 1 bay leaf.  The fennel seeds are a nice touch!  This sauce was so good and tasted even better the next day.

I was going to just use the meat sauce recipe from my favorite lasagna but thought I'd look around and see what's out here.  What do I pull up?  The sauce recipe from my favorite lasagna!  This sauce is great as is, and the best part is, you can tweak it a bit as you like.  add more garlic, less sugar, spicy sausage,...whatever and the end product is always delicious.  I personally like a thick sauce so I omit 1/2 of the tomato sauce this recipe calls for, still delicous!  Try it you will love it.

I started making this sauce a few months ago. Since then, I absolutely REFUSE to buy any at the store. I love to add in fresh tomatoes from our garden, but even without it, this sauce KICKS tail. If I learned how to put it up in jars, I'd keep it on hand all the time. It makes a ton, and it is the single best sauce I have ever eaten.

I have been making this recipe for a long time now.  It is excellent.  Over time I made a few changes that perfect this recipe!  1)  Add more garlic!  You really can't put in too much!  2)  Substitute a dry red wine for half of the the water.  3)  Add 4-6 chopped fresh basil leaves!  You'll love the aroma in the kitchen, and be amazed at how it affects the taste of the sauce.  4)  Add about 1/2 tsp of oregano, and 1 bay leaf.  Amazing pasta sauce!

We took this to a pasta potluck and received many compliments and requests for the recipe! My daughter actually made it and said it was quick and easy. [But not quite as good as her husband's ;-)] Since everyone seemed to really like it I rated it five stars.  Personally, it was too much meat for me and next time I will cut the sugar in half or omit it entirely.  If you can find the Contadina brand tomato products I recommend using them.  Their flavor is less acidic than other brands.  This may be why I didn't think it needed the sugar.  Their roasted garlic flavored tomato paste is the best!!

I absolutely love this sauce! I didn't change anything, only made a small addition.  I like things a little spicy, so I added crushed red pepper flakes.  I will definately make this again!

Delicious.. We made this in a Crock Pot and Cooked all day, Only a Few Differences.. First Used Italian Ground Sausage instead. Used Tomato Sauce instead of Canned Tomatoes. Extra little Seasoning to Taste... My Family Loved this. Nobody wanted to Stop eating. No longer will we use Canned sauce, this our new Sauce. We will use with Our Lasagna... Thank you John for Sharing... Please note if you like Spicy, then  Spice it up.. Don't knock a star because you want a bit more Bite, If you want Sweet, Use extra Sugar. Just taste as you add so you don't over Do it... Every recipe as perfect for some maybe not for others, Follow the General Recipe of Any kind and Spruce it up to your Tastes. Good luck and Enjoy... Again, we are thrilled to be done with canned sauce...TY :)  ..

Very Good! I scaled to 4 servings, didn't add the ground beef or fennel seed (didn't have), and used fresh ground sage sausage.   I only cooked the sauce on low for 45 minutes and my kids LOVED it and asked for seconds. Served with cheese ravioli.

Very good, love the flavor. IT says to turn it on low to simmer, but my stove has both a simmer setting and low. Turn it on simmer, to prevent sauce from drying up.

Made this recipe as written, except used 3/4 pound italian sausage -- that seemed like enough.  Husband, who's a big fan of meat sauce, said it was a keeper.

With this recipe, even my hubby can make a great pasta sauce for us. He usually adds mushrooms and uses wine in place of the water. Lovely little recipe and many thanks for sharing!

I live in Brussels and my husband is Italian. His grandmother lived in Dabruzzo in Italy and he always raved about her pasta sauce, until she died last year. So, I made this pasta sauce for him and he was mortified by how sweet it was. 2 tablespoons of sugar in a pasta sauce is apparently just not done. It is an American perversion of things done up like ketchup. The sugar just blew the thing to shreds. If I make this again, I'm going to change everything using the recommendations of folks on here, but more likely I'll try to find a recipe in a local cookbook.

This is a basic sauce, and certainly is not the "BEST PASTA SAUCE". Not nearly enough garlic and could use more onion.  Should have also specified what type of canned tomatoes to use. Also should have specified how the sausage should be served(ground, whole, sliced?) 
1 and a half hours is not needed to cook a sauce like this, will taste the same at one hour.
Fennel was a nice touch, this recipe is average at best. This sauce uses no olive oil and that is why i am going to give one star, because tomato sauce without olive oil is idiotic(i prefer Dececco).
Ditch Italian seasoning for some fresh basil and parsley,

This sauce is wonderful. I'll never buy store bought sauce again. Infact, I'm thinking I could  make a big batch and can it (without the meat). Think I'll add a little oregano.

I made this sauce as per the recipe, and it was not well received. I made it a second time, without the fennel seed, and everyone really enjoyed it. Fennel seed is good in sausage, but not a good ingredient in a red sauce.

I have to admit this is a very, very good meat sauce. With the exception of adding fennel (store was out or didn't carry it) I followed the recipe until the end of the cooking time. BTW I worked and was taught at a very large Italian restaurant in Massachusetts so I think I have a decent tongue. When all was done I tasted it. Good...very good, yet with no uniqueness or direction. I added a bit of salt and that helped, but it took a half cup of cabernet to really make the other flavors pop out. Five minutes extra uncovered with some stirring to mix it in. Served over spaghetti with a Zinfandel on the side made a great meal.
We all have different tastes and this sauce could have turned in a different direction by using a 1/4 cup of bourbon instead of the wine.
I like the addition of the mild or sweet sausage and I suppose one could spend a lifetime trying all the varieties of those in your sauce. Ah...What a pleasure it will be.

Oh my goodness - fixed pretty much as recipe called for - delicious.  Only addition was some homemade meatballs I had in the freezer that needed to be used up so skipped the ground beef and italian sausage.  Also added a little crushed red pepper to spice it just a bit.  Served this for dinner and I personally ate leftovers for breakfast AND lunch the next day.  Made a HUGE vat of sauce using the "almost gallon size" (I call it the industrial size can) of Contadina chopped tomatoes from Sams and added the spices/onions/garlic, etc in proportionate amts.  Cooked in crock pot and served over spaghetti with some sliced fresh Mozzarella cheese over the top - I will NEVER buy sauce to "doctor up" again.  This was the bomb....and I might add my family LOVES italian.  It made about 7 meals with probably enough leftover for 6 more servings....but we like ample amts of sauce.  Takes a little more time than popping open a jar but well worth the effort when you sit down to enjoy it.

This is flat out the best spaghetti sauce recipe I have ever found. Of course, I did make some modifications though. Based on a previous commenter, I did use red wine instead of water and added oregano (fresh!). Here are my additions.... 4-5 cloves of garlic, 15-20 sicilian olives finely chopped, and 3-4 ounces of bacon fat added to the meat, onion, and garlic cooking. Three words... OH... MY... GOD.....

Sounded a bit meaty with almost 2 pounds of meat, but went ahead and tried it anyway. The recipe is very similar to my own, with more meat of course,a slight variance in the spices and the addition of fennel and some extra tomato paste. After reading all the rave reviews I had to try it. My husband assured me that there is "nothing wrong with my sauce and no need to try another one." I however, wanted to see what all the fuss was about so I tried it out. I followed the recipe closely but did add a couple of bay leaves,brown sugar instead of white, and sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil rather than with the meat as I didn't want to lose any of the flavor when I drained the meat. I put it in the crock pot on high for about 3 1/2 hrs then turned to low for about 1 hour. Tasted great! The fennel is a nice addition. The meatieness is perfect for lasagna, however, I would use less if making it to pour over pasta. All in all a great sauce. Thanks John.

I added a bay leaf and subbed some red wine for the water. I also used quite a bit more garlic. Its a good base recipe for you to spice up the way you like it!

OMG!!  When my kids were little I made a really good spaghetti sauce, but over the years I have tried to make it and it just wasn't right...until now. This tastes like (well actually better) what I used to make. It was pure heaven!!  We loved it.  I did a few minor alterations..roasted garlic tomato paste, red wine, oregano and rosemary, 2 bay leaves(never did find them LOL) and diced bell pepper..I love bell pepper in my sauce.  Anyway..we sat down to supper, we looked at each other and said "now that's what I'm talking 'bout"...it is soooo good you can't wait to take another bite.  YUM!!!  Everyone should give this a try you will not be sorry!  Also, I used the crock pot and it cooked it perfectly...just too hot here in New Mexico to turn the range top or oven on.  Anyway, have some in the freezer and can hardly wait to have another meal. Thanks!!!

What I could spoon off the counter was delish. Unfortunatly, I decided to throw mine in the blender for a smoother texture and the bottom of the blender fell off, ugh. I am going to make this again tomorrow night so we don't have to taste test it off the counter anymore =)

This is a great sauce recipe. It's very close to my own homemade sauce minus the fennel (I don't really see it fitting into this recipe, but to each his own!). I try to cook delicious but healthy foods for my family, so I do often add sausage, but only about 1/4 pound and the rest of the meat is lean ground turkey. It's just enough sausage to add a bit of punch, but not ruin the dish nutritionally. I also got a tip from one of the best cooks I've ever known and that is to always add a cap full of whiskey to your pasta sauce (any pasta sauce). (Okay, just for clarification, that is a CAP full, not a cup full! lol) Anyway, I don't know why, but it makes all the difference! It takes the place of the sugar in the sauce. Give it a try and see what you think. (Don't worry, once in the sauce, you can't taste or even smell the whiskey. It just blends into the sauce and somehow makes it exceptional!)

Great sauce. Only recommendation is to crush the fennel seed using a mortar and pestle before adding it to the sauce.

This was a good sauce, but the world's best? It really didn't rock my world. But then, I think the pasta sauce that my aunt taught me to make is the world's best. And personally? I would never add sugar to a pasta sauce. It shouldn't need it.

I use this recipe in the slow cooker for 6 hours on low and I have perfected making pasta sauce.  This is an excellent recipe.  My Italian fiance said it's as good as his mothers.

Very good pasta sauce.  I made the following changes/additions.  I used Marzano whole canned tomatoes instead of crushed. I crushed them myself with a potato masher.  I substituted brown sugar for white.   I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2. I added 1 cup red wine instead of water. I added 1 cup sun-dried tomato pesto (Progresso) and used fresh basil and oregano instead of dried basil, fennel seed and italian seasoning.  My husband said this was the best pasta sauce he has ever had, and we eat italian food quite often.

Top Notch!Added 1C red wine at the start and 1/2C beef broth and sliced zuchini 1-1/2 hours in and then simmered 1-1/2 hours more. Flavors really locked in the next day.

My family and I loved this!  It is so much better than even the best jar brand pasta sauce.  The only thing I did differently was to use all ground beef since I didn't have Italian sausage.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, and did not make any modifications. Next time I would probably try decreasing the amount of sugar (found it too sweet), use hot italian sausage instead of sweet, and make in the slow cooker so the spices can blend a bit better. Loved the addition of fennel.

I added one half cup small diced green peppers in addition to the half cup onion.  I sauteed the green peppers and onion in a little olive oil until translucent, then added to the sauce.  I used hot italian sausage instead of sweet (the tomato sauce hides the spicy and it just ends up being more flavorful than just sweet sausage)  I add a little more garlic , and just be careful when adding salt because the sausage is already salty.  I used 1/2 cup wine.  Turned out AMAZING.  Thank you :)

Yiikes, I guess I'm in the minority here but I definitely did NOT think this was the "world's best pasta sauce." The sauce was way too thick and sweet, and had a very odd aftertaste that I could not quite place. I used this sauce in my lasagna and my husband asked me not to ever make it again... ack! I'm sorry, but we just didn't care for this. I will have to keep looking. Thank you for sharing!

Love this sauce. I made it just as the recipe states and it was absolutely delicious and my family loved it.  I finished it 3 days after making it and it was even better on the 3rd day.  This is a recipe I will use over and over again. Thanks for sharing it!

Tasty! Very rich in flavor, I really loved it, I actually made 35 servings. In the beginning it was a bit bland so I added in more onion and garlic and oregano, it is so good! Thanks for this recipe, I will be making again soon

This sauce was amazing.  I loved it.  Next time I may try taking the meat and making meatballs with it vs cooking it in the sauce.  We absolutely loved this sauce as is, and you can do so many more things with it.

John's 'World's Best Pasta Sauce' really is the best. Wish he would publish one that doesn't use meat that I could cook meatballs in. What about it, John? Maybe I'll use the same recipe, use pork neck bones rather than ground meat. Hm-m-m-?

From someone who has visited Italy every summer since I was four, I have to say this is a truly an amazing meat sauce! I'm actually making it right now. It is very rich and makes even a basic spaghetti dish shine. I use it at least every other week and my boyfriend never tires of it. I add one more clove of garlic, omit the fennel, and do not use crushed tomatoes simply because I do not like chunks in my pasta. Besides that it is perfection.Thanks John!

This is my "go to" sauce! I discovered it and first used it in the World's Best Lasagna recipe, and have since been making the sauce for call my pasta dishes and made it again today for a Zucchini Parmesan recipe. I mix/match fresh and dried herbs depending on what I have in stock but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. This sauce is delicious!

I've made my mom's sauce for 27+ years and many people ask for the recipe; however, I've become bored with it and was looking for something different.  I found it in this sauce!!  It was excellent.  Due to personal family dislikes, I did omit the ground beef and fennel seed but the blend of the other flavors are truly delicious.  If you like meat & fennel, by all means, add it because with or without, it's definitely an excellent recipe.  This is absolutely a keeper!  Thank you!

Lives up to its name. Like most I tweaked to my liking but no significant changes. Used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. Twice the salt called for. Ground sausage versus link. That's it. Great sauce!

I finally tried this sauce. I have to say it's so meaty that there is no actualy sauce...leaves a dry spaghetti. Next time I will add more spices and add 28 oz can of tomatoe sauce. Otherwise it would be fabulous.

My family LOVES this sauce and the lasagna.  We googled for the world's best lasagna and this was it!  And we've been using the sauce for our pasta ever since.  On the rare occasion that we have pasta without this sauce I get moans and groans from the kids.  Nothing compares, and we're sticking with it.

Very rich tasting....robust may be more appropriate. Be careful with the fennel seeds...a little goes a long way. The taste is excellent. The only thing I changed was that I added a little garlic salt (personal preference).

I absolutely have to agree.  I have made the lasagna several times and it remains my favorite.  I do add extra red pepper flakes, b/c I like it 'kicked up' a bit!  This is a fantastic meat sauce recipe.

I made only 2 changes. Red wine instead of water and brown sugar instead of white. Wonderful recipe. Thanks for posting it.

I have made this so  many times, I  figure it is time i rate it! Never again will I buy jarred sauce again! I replace the water with red wine and don't use a tablespoon of salt. Sometimes I leave out the sausage ...depends if I have it on hand or not. It is great with or without! I really don't think it's all the much work. It freezes great!

After the Lasagne recipe, I had little doubt about this one, John. I tried it as is and loved it. I tried it after replacing the water with red wine, adding some chopped diced red peppers and sauted/sliced shrooms and backing off a tad with the sugar, and I gotta tell ya, it was worth the risk. Keep 'em coming John!

My grandma from Italy used to make a sauce that I thought was the greatest food ever. I think you could pass this recipe off as her sauce.

I've made this exactly as written as it's excellent! I've also made a few changes to suit my taste. If you like your sauce spicy, substitute hot Italian sausage for the sweet Italian sausage, and add some red pepper flakes. Otherwise, this is an amazing sauce.

Have made this recipe several times and it is great every time.  The only changes I have made along the way are I use sweet Italian turkey sausage (taken out of casing) and use half the amount of sugar.  Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing it!

I am married to an Italian, whose family made great dishes.  When I was making this sauce, my husband said, it smelled like his Grandma"s kitchen. Now that"s a compliment.  I did everything the same except used the red wine, instead of water, and I used Ground Pork and Ground Beef.  Fabulos meal - Love it!!!!  I am going to try this sauce in my Lasagna too........

Fabulous home made sauce!  This is the sauce from a similarly named "Word's Best Lasagna" recipe.  The lasagna is pretty good, but the sauce is close to extraordinary by itself.  Great consistency, amazing flavor.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  Next time, I will leave out the fennel and maybe add some parmesan cheese to the sauce.  Fennel is not my favorite spice, and although it wasn't obvious in the sauce, the few times I noticed the flavor of fennel was a little distracting.  The cheese is something that can be added at the end, but I love the zing of mixing it in.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh, and I would definitely recommend making it the day before and refrigerating overnight to blend flavors.  This is a big batch, so you will have some to freeze.

Great flavor but too much meat for my preference.  Next time I would only do 1/2 of the meat porportions.

Thanks so much for a great recipe.  I followed it pretty closely, but didn't have any fennel seeds.  I did see fennel seeds in the sweet italian sausage I bought.  I made mine a little meatier with a full 1.25 lbs of sausage, and over a pound of hamburger.  I used diced rather than crushed tomatoes, and simmered the sauce all afternoon.  It is simply delicious.  Thanks so much.

I used ground Italian sausage instead of sliced links and left out the fennel seed because I am not a fan.  The sauce came out very thick and meaty.  Great flavor but next time will cut down on the meat and will make in the crock pot like other reviewers mentioned.  Thanks!

Glad to see that you posted the sauce recipe.  I have been making just the sauce from your lasagne recipe for several years.  It is just the  best sauce and I always make a double batch to freeze.

It is hard to go wrong with this recipe, I give it 5 stars as written.  I personally like to use red wine or beef broth for the water and either natural or brown sugar.  Oh, and a handful of mushrooms.  I leave out the fennel, the sausage I buy has plenty in it.  Thank you for this recipe.

Great!  I have made this pasta sauce for the World's Best Lasagna that also was submitted by this reviewer.  Wonderful flavor.  A little more time consuming than many pasta sauce recipes but well worth it.  Even better the next day.

Excellent! This is the best sauce that I have ever made or purchased. I don't add quite as much sugar, and I add a bay leaf when simmering, and it is perfect! I was buying jarred sauces, but they started tasting too sweet, so I found this recipe and I will never use another! Thank you so much John!

This is awesome. I had never before made homemade sauce. Had always wanted to but never done it. This was the best experience ever, not only was it easy to make, but tasted amazing as well. Thank you for the great recipe. I will never use jar sauce again, well as long as I am not in a pinch.

Fantastic! We loved this. I used an Italian Sausage with Garlic from the local butcher shop (only Italian sausage I've ever liked), added parsley and crushed red pepper flakes, and omitted the fennel. I let it simmer for 3 or 4 hours and the end result was awesome. Thanks :)

This was a really great recipe, easily adjusted to suit your family's tastes.  I removed the sausage from it's casing, added more onion and garlic, used red wine instead of water, and used fresh oregano and fresh basil.

**AWESOME**  I did however take some advice from some others along with my own added twist.  I used the red wine instead of water and added 1/4-1/2 cup of beef stock (as I don't like my sauce that thick)along with 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary and oregano.  I didn't use the sausage, just the hamburger meat.  I also used a can of Rotel Tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes.  Lastly, I added green bell pepper and red pepper for a little more zip.  My husband wasn't liking my old recipe so when we were done tonight, he told me I was not CHOPPED!  LOL  Everyone even went back for seconds!

This is a very thick and rich sauce... I think I prefer a slightly thinner sauce.  That is no fault of the recipe just personal preference.  Next time I may just use on can of tomato paste.  Overall very tasty though, thanks for sharing!

Made a double batch of this so I'd have some to freeze.  I added a pinch of red pepper flake, more garlic and onion, and rough chopped fresh basil too. I also subbed red wine for the water, and also poured in a can of beef broth. Maybe not world's best, but pretty darn good!

I made spaghetti with this, and it was really good. I didn't have any fennel seed, so I subbed a little bit of dill, and some maple syrup (be careful with the dill...too much can ruin it!) I used four large tomatoes from my garden, and crushed them myself. It was a little acidic this way, but I couldn't dock the stars for a substitution I made. All I can say is, I can't wait to try the lasagna with this!

Very good sauce.  I only used 1 can of paste and after delglazed with red wine after cooking onion and garlic.  Instead of the meat sauce I cooked meatballs.  Baked them in the oven for 15 minutes and then added them to the sauce.  Also added alittle more garlic and left out the fennel.  Delish!!!

This has become my go-to tomato sauce.  I just leave out the meat for a a great marinara.  I see that someone suggested using all ground beef.  I've done that when I was out of Italian sausage, but it's MUCH better and richer with the addition of sausage.  This sauce reminds me of my Italian Grandmother's.  It's delicious!

THIS IS A WONDERFUL PASTA SAUCE! I used 5 lbs seeded and skinned fresh garden tomatoes/juices to replace the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and water. Double the recipe but only used 1 lb Italian sausage, 1 lb ground beef, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 T of fresh basil from the garden, 1/2 tsp fennel seeds, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, and 1/2 tsp salt. Also, I used garden onions (2 small ones) and minced garden garlic. ***** MADE 5 QUARTS ***** Next times, I would like to make 2 varieties of this recipe by making a zero meat sauce. Also, I would like to use this recipe for pasta sauce with meatballs and not have ground beef in the sauce.

I was really excited to try this recipe out but was bummed with the results. I don't know if I did something wrong, but I swear my fiance said it tasted like a manwich. Not exactly bad as he likes a good manwich now and again, but not what we were expecting from a pasta recipe. He ate it all, so it wasn't a complete waste. just won't make again.

WONDERFUL!  This was probably the best homemade meat sauce I've ever made.  Absolutely a keeper!  I used this to make a lasagna and it came out delicious.  I even had enough sauce left over to freeze.  If you like meat, you need to try this!

This sauce is incredible! Like other commenters have said, you can add 1/2 tsp of oregano or more. I also like to use a bay leaf. Instead of losing it in the sauce (finding a bay leaf in your meal isn't exactly pleasant), I wrap it in a coffee filter and tie it to my sauce pot. That way the bay leaf seasons the sauce but I can just snip it off and throw it out before serving!

Followed the original recipe with red wine substituted for water, more ground beef instead of the sausage, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and  1/2 tsp oregano. 

Definitely wasn't flavorful enough for my liking; could have used half as much wine and more spices. I'll be sure to try it again with some changes and see if I can get the same results as others here.

OMG!  Delicious!  I've made this twice and followed the recipe exactly and loved the result.  And so did my 4 year old.  But like any great recipe, this is not set in stone.  In my 3rd, 4th and 5th versions of this sauce, I've done something different due to what was in my fridge at the time and to whom I was serving.  I cut the sugar but added red wine, or added ground turkey, tried different veggies or added a cheese rind as another reviewer suggested.  While some versions I thought were better than others, all versions were voraciously eaten to those it was served.   I've decided to make a huge batch of this sauce once a month, freeze some and use the rest in another pasta recipe.  Thanks.

I've been making spaghetti sauce for 30 years and I honestly believe this recipe is the best and easiest around. The combination of flavors from the sweet Italian sausage and ground chuck melts perfectly with the herb combination and the crushed tomatoes. I thought two cans of tomato paste would make it like glue. Boy, I was wrong. It is "bring the big boss to dinner" fabulous. I am subbing red wine for the water next time only because I have some pride left and want to make this sort of my own. Bon Appetite.

Years ago I used to make my own pasta sauce and then all the good bottled sauces came on the market.  I was excited to try this recipe to get back to cooking from scratch.  It was average and I still prefer Barilla in the jar.  It's also less time consuming and messy!

I made this last night- I am very picky with my pasta sauce and it was wonderful.  I made only a couple of changes and it came out great... I omitted the water because I find it makes it too watery and I like my sauce a little thicker.  I used crushed tomatoes with basil already in them instead of adding dried and I omitted the fennel because my husband is not a fan.  I also added just a teaspoon of chili powder.  The key really is to let it simmer for a long time- it combines all of the flavors together so well.  Don't make this sauce heat it and serve- it will not be the same it has to simmer!  Loved and will be  my go to meat sauce from now on!

Loved this recipe. I did make changes based on what I had in my pantry so stop reading if you want to know how it turns out if followed exactly! Used 1 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes (drained the can off), omitted the paste (had none), used 2 tsp of Ital seasoning on accident, used garlic salt in place of regular and equiv of 1 clove of minced garlic, used minced onion from spice rack (1 1/2 T)to save time, omitted ground beef, omitted water, omitted fennel - it is in sausage anyway.  Those were my changes, but this was a great recipe to use as a base. The kids loved it and they normally do not like spaghetti sauce!

The first time I made this I made it exactly as written and using a sweet onion (b/c that's all I had) and the sweet sausage than adding the sugar i felt it was just a tad too sweet, but it was still incredible compared to the store bought sauces I've always used. Plus it was super easy to make. Why buy sauce when you can make it this easy at home? This time I made it and all I did was omit the sugar and instead of cooking the ground beef I made homemade meatballs. OOOMMMGGG This was AMAZING!!! I'm using the sauce tonight with my homemade pizza and the meatballs tomorrow in meatball grinders. Now I HAVE to try John's Lasagna! Thanks John.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was amazing.  My husband agreed that it was some of the best sauce he's ever eaten, definitely restaurant quality.

So I read about 10 reviews down and decided to modify the recipe as such:  added the lemon/pepper spice to the cooking chicken cubes as well as some Mrs. Dash.  Used cream of mushroom soup and threw some frozen peas on the bottom of the casserole (didn't cook them first).  I actually used shredded asiago cheese for a little extra sharpness.  Instead of sour cream as some people recommended, I used the Phili cooking sauce (garlic and herb).  Used fresh broccoli and steamed it to al dente stage.  For the topping, I used the butter and italian herb bread crumbs and some of the left over asiago cheese.  YUMMY!  My husband wasn't as fussy on it as he is not a 'cream' guy - he would rather have spaghetti sauce 5 days/week!  I LOVED it.  Just enough zip to make it tasty and very simple.

I made this exactly as written for the lasagna (also by orginal poster). This sauce was sooo good. I may omit a bit of the salt next time. Sure it's easier to open a jar of sauce but this is sooo much better!

This is a great sauce.  While yes, I do some tweaks of my own, it is excellent as written.  My families personal preferences call for hot ground Italian sausage instead of sweet, and we throw in a bag of mini pepperonis as well.  I also double the batch and use 1 28oz can crushed tomatoes and 1 28oz can petite diced tomatoes to add some extra texture.  I throw it in the crock pot on low and let it simmer for about 8 hours and then freeze or pressure can the leftovers to use in future recipes.  I haven't bought jarred sauce in over two years!

I was really pleased with the way this came out. I would rate it more like 4 1/2 stars based off the fact I tweaked the recipe a little. I used hot breakfast sausage from Jimmy Deans instead of the sweet sausage. I cooked the ground beef and sausage seperate from the sauce due to the grease factor. I also added oregano, a touch of garlic powder, and upped the amount of other spices. I ended up only using 1 can of tomato paste becuase I didn't want the sauce to thick. I let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes then added the meat. Then I let the sauce with the meat simmer for another 1.5 hours.  I loved the addition of the fennel seed also. I will definitely be making this again and will never buy the jar stuff again.

I've been making this sauce for a couple years, not sure why I haven't reviewed it before. This sauce is great. I do change it just a bit. I use wine for the water, fresh basil and kind of eyeball the seasonings. I also usually leave out the meat, I love making this with Meatball Nirvana (also on this site). Yummy!

This is as close to my mama's sauce as it gets!! She always added sherry.. about 1/4 cup to deglaze the pan after you drain the fat and before you add the tomatoes.   Do not skip the fennel.  It is what puts the sauce over the top! It is the thing that makes everyone wonder??..what is it that? that makes the sauce so good?

This was my first time making homemade pasta sauce and it was delicious. I added a handfull of mushrooms and a can of black olives. It was awfully thick so I used half a bottle of red wine to thin. Wonderful!

Considering all the extra steps I take in order to jazz up jarred sauces, this is easier, faster and tastier! In the future I would add a jar of mushrooms, but otherwise it's perfect the way it is. I will be using this recipe from now on, thank you for sharing.

I found this recipe when it was originally posted as world's best lasagna.  No doubt it lives up to its name - this sauce is  by far the best I have ever had and it receives rave reviews every time.  I used it for all different pasta recipes, and it is worth every bit of effort and then some!  You will NOT be disappointed!!

i had already made john's lasagna (which was fantastic, by the way) and i absolutely loved the sauce in the recipe.  the next day i decided to google more amazing sauce recipes and to my surprise this was also top rated.  i guess i won't mess with perfection.   only thing... i don't add any sugar, it's great without it based on my personal taste buds.

I have used this recipe numerous times. I don't always remember the recipe exactly and have used too twice as much fennel, added wine instead of water, used too much parsley, used different sausage, and it has never disappointed my family. I do all the cooking and my family asks for this a lot.

Very good...I did not add the meat as I wanted to use the sacue with chicken parm and it still turned out well.  I did like others and substituted the water with wine, but I did add some water due to the thickness.  Will definitely make again, but probably cut down on the paste.

This is my fourth time making this sauce in a month, and just want to say we love it!  I added more garlic and onion this time, and 1 TBS of brown sugar (only because I like a sweeter sauce). It tastes fabulous.  Next time I am going to try sweet italian turkey sausage and ground turkey to make it even lower fat.  Also I used salt free crushed tomatoes and sauce.  The salt was not missed at all.  Thanks John (kissing my fingers to you)!

I have made the author's other recipe Worlds Best Lasagna recipe over and over.  It really is the best.  (I sub red wine for the water and sugar)So, I knew this would be a winner.  I am making it with whole Italian sausages in it (to be served on rolls later) and adding meat balls to be served over pasta.  Thanks for the great recipes!!!

was looking for a sauce that my mother used and this came close.  i didnt add the ground beef, and instead of sugar i added about a tablespoon of grape jelly, (sounds weird) but that was what my mom always used.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  It turned out exactly like my mother's recipe!!

Fantastic!!  Just a hint of sweetness, and this really shines.  Super easy too.  I cooked the sausuage links, then sliced them, a little easier.  Kick it up with a spicy sausage instead of sweet.  GREAT!!!!

What can I say except it's great? Nice and meaty, full of flavor. I use the bulk ground Johnsonville Italian sausage for recipes like this and like it very much. I don't know if they sell it ground in packages everywhere, but if they do have it, it's right by the ground pork. You can adjust the spices in this to your taste--I add extra fennel, garlic, and I add crushed red pepper. I sub a grated carrot for the sugar (I got that idea from identifying carrots in my favorite pasta sauces from restaurants here--all the ones I like the best have a carrot in them!) Thanks for the recipe -- best sauce I've ever made at home, a great blend of spices, almost nothing left out! Go easy on the salt, by the way -- canned veggies & Italian sausage have some already, plus most of us are going to serve this with canned cheese (you know you have some, and you know it's 99% salt, 1% cheese.) I plan ahead when I'm using that stuff to not oversalt!

this sounds a lot like my recipe, so i know it's good!  the only differences are:  i don't use Italian sausage (altho i HAVE, and i like it);i use 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white; instead of Italian seasoning, i use 2 bay leaves, oregano and parsley; no salt or pepper; and a cup of red wine; no water.  and i agree!  it's the BEST!!!

This was pretty good.  Made for a dinner party and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  The best part is how it held together when serving it!  I hate when it does not look good on the plate.

If you like a sweeter sauce, this is the one for you. I cooked the meat and then put it all in the crock pot for the afternoon. Got lots of compliments on it.

A nice sauce but certainly not the best - we all agreed our other sauce is better.  We did enjoy it tho.  I made it exact but did add some fresh baby portabellas.

Trust me, this IS NOT, the world's best pasta sauce. I left out the sugar, and STILL, it's WAY too sweet. Wouldn't make it again.

i'm giving this 4 stars, only because i think a 5 star rating should be like "blow my socks off out of the world amazing" and this wasn't... but it was  good!  I did substitute hot italian sausage for sweet sausage... not sure if that makes a diff, but the sauce seemed reasonably sweet already (a by product of the tomatoes and sugar?).  very good recipe, easy to make, love it!

This was bland and sweet - not as savory as I'd hoped - I can use it as a base and just mess with it.

No need to buy sauce in a jar anymore, this stuff is perfect. We made the sauce "as is" and put it into the crockpot on low for about 5 hours.  Thanks!

I knew better when I looked at the overload of cans of tomato items but since this sauce had so many great reviews, I decided to make it exactly as directed.  This is a pasta sauce for people that like a super heavy, tomato sauce.  I made it to put in my lasagna dish.  For that purpose it works.  You can regulate how much sauce to use and it is very flavorful (if you LOVE tomatoes) and does not take over if you do not use too much.  I ended up giving the leftover sauce to my neighbor that is used to bottled sauces.  He loved it.  Don't waste your money on the sweet sausage.  You can't taste the meat or anything else because of the overload of tomato products.

For me this is the best pasta sauce, it is how my mother and grandmother made it and is how I make it. The only thing I do not use in it is the fennel. Other then that this is the best.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for...oh my goodness literally couldn't walk by the pot without sticking a spoon in. I can't stand the sweet sauces or bland sauces this is just salty enough without over powering the rest of the food. I think what really did it was the sausage and beef juices being left in really gave it good flavor. Amazing sauce.

This was the first recipe I've tried for homemade pasta sauce and I absolutely love it! It was easy to make and tasted absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend tried it and said that it beats his dad's sauce which I never thought I would be able to out-do. So now this recipe is one of my regular go-to's and will be used for every lasagna and spaghetti dinner in my house.

This was the best sauce I've ever made!  I pretty much followed the directions except only added about 1/2 pnd hamburger and I didn't have any fennel seed.  Other than that, followed it to the letter.  Made traditional spaghetti with it the first night and froze the leftovers in a gallon baggy.  That was about 3 weeks ago and tonight I made Lasagna and it was the best.  This will be my go to sauce from now on.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

I made this several months ago on a whim, but forgot to save it to my recipe file. I've been looking and looking for it. Here it is!!!! This is by far my favorite pasta sauce! We had it for dinner on rigatoni and I saved the rest in small batches in the freezer. It was amazing! Holy smoke this is good!

I've been making this one for years, now. For spaghetti, lasagna, everything. Maybe a modification here or there, but this is the master recipe. If I want a smoother textured sauce, I sometimes use an immersion blender to get it where I want. Truly the best!

I made a double batch of this sauce so I could share it with others.  It was FANTASTIC, to say the least!  I added a double batch of Chef John's meatballs, delicious.  Oh yeah, I did not add the beef, only the sausage.  I was tempted to go with Italian hot sausage but decided to follow the recipe and used sweet Italian sausage, which was good because we had a houseful of young kids to feed.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a keeper.

I am Italian, and this is definitely my go-to recipe for meat sauce.  My entire family loves it....I triple the recipe and freeze the sauce and it is awesome.  I use ground sweet Italian sausage and ground beef. I also double the garlic.

I tend to make this meatless.  Sometimes simmer whole Italian sausage links or add meatballs depending on my mood. I do add a whole teaspoon of fennel and a teaspoon of ground fennel as well.

This is my go to spaghetti sauce. I have always made the lasagna and always make extra sauce to freeze. My only change is to use fresh basil! I just can't say enough about this recipe, it really is one of the best!

This was my first time making sauce from scratch (usually, I use a jar).  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out beautifully.  I was surprised how easy it was to make and will certainly make this sauce again.  It definitely makes a large batch so next time I will half the recipe.  Looking forward to leftovers!!

I've been making this for a year now.  It is GREAT as written and that is how I usually make it.  It's so good I find myself spooning it cold out of the frig for a taste.  Some times I vary it for a different taste, depends what I have in the cupboard.  As for the sugar, I like it.  I'm from Ohio, state of the best sweet tomatoes.  The sugar enhances what you're missing out of the canned tomatoes.  It's not in there to sweeten the sauce.  It is too thick for my lasagna, because we are a more CHEESE lasagna  loving family.  But I plan on converting the thickness of it to my lasagna.  The taste is great.  My friend's Italian family gave great reviews when I sent a meal over to them and asked if I would give the recipe to their mom.  Thanks John for the great recipe.

Very very good! I cut out the ground beef and just used 1 lb of hot italian sausage. I think it would have been too "meaty" for my taste otherwise. Using the hot sausage instead of sweet gave it just the right amount of spice we were looking for. This will def be my go to sauce recipe from now on. Making more of it this weekend to freeze!

Bravo John, Bravo! I made this for dinner tonight and can’t get over how delicious it is. I did however change a few things: 1) I used sweet sausage but crumbled it up instead of slicing it not a big difference 2) Instead of water I used ¼ cup of strong red wine and ¼ cup of chicken stock. I’m glad I make this change because the wine faded nicely into the background of the dish but added depth to it. 3) Instead of ground beef I used high quality frozen meatballs which my family likes. And 4) I used my slow cooker and simmered on low for about 6 hours, allowing all the dried herbs time to season properly. I love this sauce and while I love the convenience of jarred sauces, they all fall short of the flavor of this one. Thank you for a truly great recipe…Bravo!

This is excellent! I combined suggestions from a bunch of reviewers, added a few touches of my own, and it was a great! Here is what I did:  exclude Italian sausage, and used extra ground beef; add diced peppers (use your favourite colour - I used yellow); replace the water with red wine; I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I used about 1 tsp of oregano, and 1/2 tsp of rosemary, and an extra dash of basil; add red pepper flakes - I used about 1 tsp; make sure you don't put too much fennel because it is really strong

This *may* well be the World's Best Pasta Sauce. I made it pretty much by the recipe except for the following changes: used only 1 6oz. can of paste, added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for some spice and added 1 TB brown sugar at the end of the cooking time because I wanted just a tad bit more sweetness. I think brown sugar adds more depth of flavor than white sugar. I will be making this again! Thank you, John!

Made this tonight.  Very good sauce.  I've never made homemade sauce before.  I've used "jar" sauce for years.  Not anymore, this was wonderful.  Made a lot of sauce, so I froze the rest for another time.

This makes a very hearty sauce.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and increased the garlic.  I added some chopped vegetables (zucchini, red pepper, etc) just to sneak it in. It needs a tubular pasta (shells, penne) to catch the sauce.

This is a delicious sauce. If you like a chunkier pasta sauce use diced canned tomatoes instead of crushed - I've made it both ways. I also like to add red peppers. I cook the sausage then throw everything in my slow cooker, stirring occasionally.

There was something missing from the taste of this sauce and I can't quite put my finger on it, thus the 4 stars.  After cooking for an hour, I took a taste and was surprised that the dominant flavor was simply tomato sauce.  I was expecting a bouquet of Italian spiciness and it just wasn't there.  I added a teaspoon of oregano and this did little to increase the robustness of this sauce.  I'm giving this 4 stars because I'm confident that were I to use some of the tweaking suggested by other raters, this sauce will become amazing.
UPDATE:  I've made this sauce a ton since my initial review.  I've tweaked it by cutting the sugar in half, adding an additional 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp of fennel, 1/2 tsp of oregano and two bay leaves.  These changes have really kicked up the flavor of the sauce.

I have made ALOT of homemade sauces from recipes from this site.  This is by far the best.  I still think Prego with added garlic, basil, and sugar is still better!  This one is much healthier and I will continue to make it..I made as is except for adding a few splashes of red wine.

This was fantastic!!  I had been searching for a great homemade pasta sauce and my search has just ended!  Love the mixture of the sweet sausage and ground beef.  The only thing I changed was to leave out the fennel seed since I didn't have any.  Thanks for a great recipe John!

I became a member just so I could give this sauce five stars.  Best I ever made.  Best I ever had.  I cooked it in the slow cooker because I had to be out all afternoon, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  This one is a keeper.

The first time I try a new recipe I usually make it exactly as the recipe states.  Then I modify as I think necessary.  Tonight I made this sauce.  Yummmm!  I'm not modifying a thing.  It's delicious.

Fantastic meat sauce!! I used 3 sweet italian sausages (casing removed). Added a couple bay leaves during simmering time. Definitely add the sugar as listed, it helps cut down on the acid in the tomatoes. I froze 4 containers for future meals. Adding "fresh basil" is a "plus flavor" ingredient I have tried your Lasagna, too, both of these recipes are exceptionally delicious! Add a salad, garlic bread, a glass of wine for a "Perfect Italian Dinner)!!!!!!!

This is our most favorite sauce. I found it when I made John's lasagna recipe which is thee best and the only way I make it now. I started making extra sauce and freezing it. I am going to make just the sauce and can it as it is way better than any store bought sauce. I do cut back on the salt and sugar. I use just sweet italian and a little hot italian sausage in place of the ground beef. My kids don't like things to hot. Thanks for sharing this!

This is very good. However, the first comment from my husband was about the sugar taste?? If I make this again, I will only put in half the sugar.

Delicious! I was a bit timid about adding fennel seeds thinking the kids would complain, so I used half the amount called for.  I used a full pound of ground beef and garlic and cheese italian sausage. It received nothing but compliments.  Will definitely use again.

AWESOME SAUCE!!! I've been making the lasagna and had used this as just a sauce before noticing this recipe... it is better than any restaurant and very easy to make! Will be making and eating this forever!!!! Thanks John... I hope to see more recipes from you:) I did forget one thing-I use beef stock instead of water. It gives it just a little more flavor. Also very good with crushed red pepper and mushrooms!

I just made this sauce as part of the lasagna recipe and I could not get enough of the sauce.  My only changes were using a heap of fresh basil (cut into ribbons) and not adding the extra salt.  I had about a cup leftover from the lasagna and I ended up tasting and "tasting" until it was all gone.  So good.

Wow John, you may not be exaggerating! This is the kind of sauce that made me hurry up and chew and swallow so I could eat more. Absolutely fabulous flavor. Typically pasta sauces taste their best a day after making but this was great straight out of the pan. The only suggestion I can add, cut back on the salt. Start with half of the amount called for because you can always add more, but you cannot take away. I'm still thirsty now and I ate this hours ago but it's worth it. Oh, and I did use fresh basil (2xs as much dried called for). HIGHLY RECOMMEND, thank you for submitting.

World's best? mmno. But great flavor and good balance of ingredients. I added a few more spices, but the ones mentioned in this recipe really came through. It may have tasted a bit like manwich, but in my household that is not a bad thing :) I'll stick to my other recipe though, which is much easier to make.

Very Good! I added 1 diced celery stalk and a few grated baby carrots to the onion mixture. Then followed the recipe. I simmered on low heat for about 2 hours waiting for my guest to arrive. Served with Texas Garlic Toast, YUMMY!

I made this the other night and it was a hit. It is very close to my recipe I have used for years. The only thing I did different was after meat, onion, and garlic were browned, I transfered to slow cooker and let it cook on low about 6 hours. Thanks for the recipe.

LOVE this sauce! It's absolutely amazing and the only sauce recipe I use now. The only slight changes I made were to substitute red wine for the water and brown sugar for the white. I'll usually use turkey sausage instead of pork, but both are delicious. After browning the onions, garlic, and meats, I'll throw everything into a slow cooker and let it cook all day. By dinner time, the house smells wonderful and it tastes like you've spent hours over a hot stove.

I made this sauce tonight (a double batch
since the reviews were so glowing) and I
thank you for getting me out of the "doctored up" jarred sauce rut! Being
me, of course I improvised a bit: Hot
Italian Sausage, Deer ground meat, porta-
bellas, and Chianti instead of water...
But that's what makes the recipe so great
--the basics are so good you can feel free to adapt it to your own tastes!!!

Yum! I've been making the lasagna that this sauce originally was posted with for a couple of years now...and I often used the sauce just by itself for pasta. I'm glad this has been reposted as a sauce alone so that people who wouldn't make lasagna aren't missing out on the great sauce. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I always make homemade sauce, but decided to change it up and try this sauce...it was very tasty!  Followed the recipe almost exactly, but used 15oz tomato sauce (couldn't find 6.5oz can) and a little extra dried basil, although would have been great w/ fresh basil too.  For the sausage, I removed the casings and ground it up with the beef.  It is a very meaty sauce...next time I may not add as much..even my meat-loving husband said it was extremely meaty!  But very tasty! thanks for sharing

Only changes I made was more garlic(as I love, love, love garlic) added crushed red pepper and red wine to replace the water......sauce was the best.  I've eaten a lot of Italian food growing up in an Italian neighborhood, and this was similar to what I would smell throughout the neighborhood when all moms were cooking their sauces...delicious.

10 22 17 ...  This is not the world's best. You can eat it, but , no. I added more spices to the sauce & tried to use it in something else. Still not. Before adding to it, the original recipe, this reminded me of Stouffer's lasagna sauce. Stouffer's lasagna is actually good for frozen food. I want better than that when I put my time in.

I love this recipe! I started making it my go-to sauce after using it in John's lasagna recipe. I use it for my lasagna, spaghetti and baked ziti. I even make it without the meat for a basic pasta sauce. I'm so glad I came across this recipe.

This is really good sauce! I made just a few changes. Instead of using the link sausage, I found ground sweet Italian sausage and used it. It helps with the texture of the sauce. I also used about three times the amount of  fresh herbs instead of dry. Finally, I cooked it twice as long as it says to. Just add water as needed. Either way, you make it, you will love it.

I make this sauce every month and freeze it.  It is a great meaty sauce, although I've never added the fennel  (don't have that in the house, always forget to buy) and I always add more onion and garlic. My 12 yr old loves this sauce. Thanks.

I've made this sauce probably 100 times now in different variations.  This is such a great basic recipe and it's easy to add or subtract based on taste preferences!  Thank you for posting it online.  Try it with FRESH pasta and it's out of control good!

After reading almost ALL the reviews.  I did not use fennel seeds ( there is plenty in the sweet Italian sausage if you have a good meat market).  I used a cabernet wine instead of water.  I used plenty of garlic, added mushrooms and a few Kalamata olives. Also added fresh rosemary and fresh oregano.  While I let it simmer in a crock pot I threw in a couple of bay leaves. I just took some out of the freezer, and it was absolutely awesome!  My husband could not have enough.  Thank-you John for this recipe and Allrecipe for letting me see this.

My Italian family has been making this recipe for generations, the only thing we do not use is the fennel seed. Sometimes we alternate with stewing meat instead of sausage. A huge family tradition for us.

Just made this for the first time and I will say for sure it won't be the last time. Very simple to make and so much better and thicker than anything store bought.  I plan if freezing it so I can have it on hand, may even try and can some and see how that comes out.

Best Lasagna and Best Sauce!!!!  I've turned my friends on to these recipes and they all agree.... the BEST!!!!!!!
Oh, and we are almost all of Italian descent ..... South Philly!
There's just one little secret that John doesn't use in his lasagna ... just a bit of nutmeg in the Ricotta (oops .. now the secret is out!)

Good ideas, similar to sauce from Sicilian grandmother.  Would only make with fresh, ripe tomatoes!  (Grandmother grew almost nothing else!)

I used this recipe as a base and it was wonderful! I altered a few things from the very start, based upon the top positive and negative reviews. I would say it is hands down the best red sauce I've had...and I'm super picky.



I added a 3/4cup onion more...just my preference
Three cloves garlic (preference)
15oz tomato sauce (sweet basil flavor)
Substituted a 1/2cup Sauvignon Cabernet for the water and sugar
No fennel seed (if you're using sweet italian sausage)
Added 1 teaspoon oregano
Lots of salt and pepper. I go by sight and preference! Taste as you go YUMM!



I cooked the sausage (155F), 
ground beef 
and the onion/mushroom/green pepper/garlic mixture*



...in three separate pans. Cook all three completely. 



*Start cooking the onions and mushrooms together first in a pan of medium low olive oil. Add a small chopped green pepper. Add garlic the last two minutes. The whole thing should take about 15min.


Combine both meats and onion/garlic mixture in a large pan. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, red wine and seasonings. Bring to simmer and follow above instructions OR


I transferred it all into a 5.5quart Crock Pot and cook on high for 3.5hrs, stirring occasionally. BEST.SAUCE.EVER.


My advice is to add more of what you like/prefer. Happy cooking!!

WOW!  This recipe is truly outstanding!  Yes, you could tweak it but my husband and I absolutely love its flavor as it reminds us of Venice! I did do one thing different.  My husband was a "cattle buyer" throughout his life before retiring, so we have a different perspective on the beef industry.  I substituted ground brisket for the ground beef which my husband grinds and packages himself. The brisket is less per pound than lean hamburger in the market so a little work yields an outstanding product!  We have discovered the small, finer, meat markets use this technique which leaves their clientele raving about their hamburger, and of course they tell their people it's a "special family secrete"! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! By the way, we use a small electric grinder so anyone can do it! -Coastal Sal

The lasagna is, indeed, the world's best! This sauce is phenomenal! Most requested dish in my family! One mistake in the sauce recipe: it should be 1 Tablespoon salt, not 1/2 teaspoon. The correct amount is in the lasagna recipe.

I tried this recipe because I couldn't remember/find my friends recipe that I had. I couldn't get it from her since she has passed away.
Made it once and loved it, even her Husband loved it. I guess it says a lot when He even asked me if I could make again for him.

I used sage sausage instead of the sweet Italian sausage. Other than that I did exactly as it called for.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.

Turned out to be very tasty. I didn't have Italian sausage so used only ground beef, although can imagine it would bring up more flavor. Definitely should use wine for water. I didn't have fennel seed but in addition to basil and Italian seasoning I added, as one reviewer suggested, 1/2 tsp of oregano and 2 bay leaves. Also for additional flavor and spycyness I added 1 tsp of chile in adobo sauce (I added only sauce although if you want to add a minced chile it should be also good but more spicy). It's a very nice basic recipe to have with which it's easy to play with as in any way it comes out very flavorful!

I have tried many variations of this recipe with great results. We use it as pizza sauce as well and have now consistently produced pizzas and pasta better than any local restaurant can match. Increasing the crushed pepper for spice is a nice touch and replacing sugar with honey from time to time adds a nice difference to the sauce.

The title is correct. Worlds best lasagna, well sauce!! I use the sauce recipe for anything requiring a good spaghetti sauce. I made this meal for my in-laws. My Italian father in-law raved about it (go me!!) and his wife (not Italian) said it was almost as good as hers.. Whatever she's just jealous. There's no way this recipe with over 500 five star reviews isn't as good or BETTER than hers. Keep the recipe- it's so yummy!! Freezes great too!

We loved this recipe. I have made it before with the lasagna recipe which is my husbands favourite recipe I make. For this sauce I used hot ground sausage and lean ground beef. I added 1 shredded carrot. I let the sauce simmer on the stove for about 5 hours and just before serving I added 1/2 cup milk and some fresh parsley. Absolutely delicious and very easy to make.

Cooked as is except fennal seeds because I didn't have any and did not add water because I used canned tomatoes from the garden and it had a little more liquid than commercial cannedtomatoes. It was fantastic!

I have been making the lasagna that goes with this sauce for years now. It's always a huge hit. I started using the sauce for spaghetti about 2 years ago with delicuous results. My husband says he could eat a bowl of just the sauce. Excellent recipe.

I made this recipe, a huge pot just as directed no alterations, OMG my family spent the hole dinner only taking about the sauce n what else we can use it in, lasagna, stuffed shells... the flavor was ridiculous the fennel, basil, Italian seasoning, garlic& onion sets it off.  Sure you can alter it per suggestion but to be real this is the one time I can say, you REALLY don't need to is's perfect. Compliments to the chef! Next time I will triple my ingredients so that I can have left overs. I couldn't stop the fam from eating. 5 Star!

Wow!  Made this the other night and it was fantastic.  Only used the sausage, as that was what I had on hand.  My husband is not fond of spaghetti, and he raved over this.  Told all our friends what wonderful spaghetti I made.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe, minus the fennel I didn't have.  I added rosemary as one review suggested. Instead of sausage/beef, I used 1.25 lbs of lean ground turkey, chopped fresh green beans, and kale for a healthier twist. Tasted great! :)

I use this sauce with any italian meal I make. The only changes I make are I substitute the sugar with honey, and simmer it longer. I first tried the lasagna with this recipe and I was hooked! Great flavor. Thank you for this awesome recipe.

I normally make marinara sauce to save on fat/calories, but decided to splurge this one time. I loved the combination of the sweet sausage and lean ground beef (I used ground round). My changes/additions were to add some fresh tomatoes and sweet peppers I had frozen last winter before they went "soft", 1/2 tsp unsweetened cocoa, 1/2 cup sweet red wine and fresh basil, rather than dried, just because I have it growing this time of year. A really great sauce I will use on pasta and maybe later in lasagna. Really loving it.

This sauce is great.  Just the way it is.  If you notice it is the sauce for this cooks awesome lasagna.  So it does not need a bunch of other vegetables.  Red wine is a great addition but it is never in place of sugar.  sugar is added to balance out the canned tomatoes.  As for the fennel over load.  No way.  Fennel is great and not too much.  Maybe some people need to stop trying recipes for kicks.  If your that great of a cook make up your own.

Absolutely delicious.  I use this all the time.  No more buying pasta sauce for me.  This is much better and SOOO easy.  Not a problem to modify/cut in half.  I've taught both my grandchildren (ages 8 and 11) how to make this sauce.  My favorite AllRecipes recipe!

I made many of the changes suggested by others: more garlic, oregano, hot pepper flakes, substituted wine for the water. I also added more ground beef, more sausage (mixed between spicy and sweet) and mini-pepporoni so it was very meaty.  I made it in my crock pot and put it on low for about 8 hours.   DANG! This the BEST pasta sauce I've ever made. The only mistake I made was not doubling the recipe so I'd have more to freeze.

Yes, excellent recipe and easy to customize! I made it as is with one modification: I added a dry red wine instead of water because I really felt water would dilute it too much. I also cooked it in a slow cooker (prepared as is, then transferred to a slow cooker for 4 hours).  The taste was very flavorful without being overbearing and perfectly thick. I am not a fan of fennel but the small amount compliments the sausage really well.  
Next time, I will add bay leaves (not sure it "needs" it), mushrooms and try ground turkey as oposed to ground beef.

Oh my word!!! This is THE BEST spaghetti sauce I have ever had in my 39 years of life. My husband, children and mother lived it. Everyone went back for seconds!  This is definitely going to be a "go to" recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  The only thing I did differently was use ground Italian sausage instead of sliced. We all loved it!

I first found this sauce when I made the "World's Best Lasagna".  Loved it!!  After browning the meat, I added it to the sauce ingredients and put in the crockpot.  Cooked on low for 6 hours. Refridgerated for a day before I needed to make my lasagna.  I thought at the time it would be a great pasta sauce on it's own.
Hubby loved it.  Most pasta sauce gives him heartburn but this one didn't.  A winner all around!!

Very good. Will try it again. Best in the world? Not to me. It makes me laugh when someone proclaims "best in the world" In order to make that claim, you have to compare it it to every sauce in the world. I doubt that you have. Egos are a funny thing. A very good recipe though.

Who needs pasta? I could eat this right out of the pot! The title is well-deserved. It's the perfect balance of spices, tomatoes and meat. Don't change a thing! Oh, and it doubles and freezes very well so make a big batch. You won't regret it.

I made this for my lasagna tonight.  It is very good!  I did use spicy Italian sausage and meatloaf meat (pork, beef, veal mix) because I had them on hand. I was a bit wary about the fennel seed but it really does add a nice flavor after the long simmer.  I also threw in a splash of balsamic and a bay leaf.  Great recipe ad easily modified for individual tastes.  Thanks so much!

I love this sauce recipe; it is my go-to for pasta. I have made it many times and it always comes out great. I usually follow it as written except that I use a full pound of both beef and sausage. I made it a few days ago and subbed red wine for the water, brown sugar for the white, and cooked it in the crockpot for 6 hours on low heat. It was wonderful! Be forewarned that this is a very thick and hearty sauce. If you prefer a mild marinara this is not the recipe for you :)

I made this sauce as per the recipe, and it was GREAT. I then made it a second time,and used 1 cup dry red wine instead of water, added 2 cloves garlic, some ground pork and bacon and it was amazing. Johns Lasagna is amazing if you never tried it...

Made the lasagna for the first time 10 years ago, and I've been using this sauce recipe ever since.  It's perfect, everyone raves! Sometimes I add 1/4 t red pepper flakes to give it more punch (I love spicy food).

I have made the "World's Greatest Lasagna" and can confirm it has to be the greatest!  I have had so many complements on that recipe and this is the same recipe minus the lasagna noodles, cheese etc.  I highly recommend this!!

This was really a good sauce...nice and thick!  I didn't have the Italian sausage so added a little extra seasoning.  It was a little sweeter than we prefer so will decrease the sugar next time but will definitely make again!  Probably the best homemade sauce I've ever made!

This was so awesome! I put a bit too much basil in to substitute for some of the other spices I didn't have. I just added another can of tomatoes and it was perfect again. Thanks

After making the ' World's best Lasagna ", I decided that the sauce is just amazing and have been making it for other Italian dishes since. The sauce is just the best.

The name says it all.  I don't even buy pasta sauce anymore.  This is now my standard.  If I need sauce without meat in it...I simply omit the meat and it's still incredible.  Wonderful recipe!

used only 1 lb of sausage ground, no onions, scaled down the tomato paste and sauce to 1 can each, 1/2 cup red wine (Shiraz) 1/4 cup of sugar, oregano instead of basil(none on hand) kept the fennel and other seasonings. Up the garlic to 5 gloves, 2 is not enough.  I also pan roasted a red & yellow bell pepper and threw it into the sauce at the last 20 minutes of simmering.  served over whole wheat pasta and some shredded mozzarella cheese. Yumo :)

This is truly a great sauce.  I made it for the lasagne which is also wonderful.  I caught my husband eating the sauce on a piece of bread before it had even cooked.  Everyone has a different taste for spaghetti sauce but this is definitely a good one!

I believe in the importance of advertising accuracy. The title of World's Best Pasta Sauce is a bit of a statement, isn't it?  Sorry, just keeping it real.  Frankly, I think the title should more appropriately be The Best Darn Pasta Sauce You'll Ever Make at Home in the World... Ever...Period!  Seriously, the sauce is delicious and relatively simple.  The most difficult thing is planning your time around the 1 1/2 hours of simmering.  I've followed other recipes that were just as good but were substantially more complicated and more time consuming.  Why do that when you can do this?  This recipe offers a great return on investment (for all you bankers out there).

This recipe was great. This was my first attempt ever at homemade sauce and I was pleasantly surprise at how good it was. Better than store bought anyday. I didn't have a few of the spices on hand..the fennel seed and italian seasoning..and I added some green pepper with the onion...but it was still delicious.

This truly was an awesome pasta sauce!  The only change I made was I used 1 c. of brown surgar instead of 3/4 cups white.  I have to give John a big high 5 on this!  I had to feed 20 co-workers for a sales meeting.  This was the first time I had ever tried it and was hoping it would turn out good.  It was better than good and all my co-workers raved about it and wanted the recipe.

I have made this sauce many times with no changes to the original recipe and each time it comes out amazing. Sometimes I do omit the meat all together or I'll add either ground beef, Italian sausage, or meatballs. Either way, it still comes out great! The last time I made I put in my slow cooker for 2 hours on high before I would have it in my slow cooker for 6-8 hours on low. When I cooked it for 2 hours on high my husband loved it and insisted that I always make it this way from now on. At first he didn't even realize I had done anything different, he just noticed it tasted even better.

Love this sauce and the Lasagna recipe, but I've made a few changes.  I use ground pork instead of Italian sausage.  When I brown it I add 1 tbsp Italian seasoning and 1 tbsp sugar.  I use 1.5 lbs beef. I also use 8 oz cans of tomato sauce.  I skip the fennel seeds and use parsley instead.  My family loves it.  I do that same thing in the lasagna sauce too and it turns out great every time.

Very tasty! It was a little sweeter than I would have liked but that's most likely due to the sweet italian sausage I used. I like my sauce spicer so I added red pepper flakes and it was good! Other than using a different sausage, I wouldn't change much.

I discovered this sauce by making it for the original lasagne recipe. This has become my red sauce staple for quite awhile now. Everyone I make it for just LOVES it. I cut back a tad on the sugar and sometimes use spicy sausage instead of sweet ..or if I don't have sausage on hand i'll just use all ground beef.  This recipe is one of my favorites....and so simple to make! Thank you John Chandler!

Truly delicious, and simple.  I've made this twice and won't buy store jarred sauce ever again.    I made it without meat so I can use it in more recipes.  I also didn't have enough tomato sauce the second time I made this, so I substituted tomato soup and it tasted the same.  Thanks for submitting such a great recipe.

VERY good!  Hubby loved it and he is very particular about spaghetti sauce.  I only used a 1/2 tsp of sugar and think next time I will try with with just ground beef just to see what they tastes like.  Thanks, John...it was yummy.

I LOVE this sauce! I normally have whole canned tomatoes on hand that I just run through the blender and use for this recipe. 2 cans of tomato paste thicken it a little much, so I normally decrease it to one can. Very flavorful and freezes beautifully. Worth the time and effort. The house always smells heavenly when this is cooking. Thanks for a great recipe John!

I love this recipe. My whole family does. Sometimes we switch it up with spicy sausage. I also add a tiny bit of red pepper flakes.  Another way I changed this up a bit was by doing the following;  Instead of browning the sausage, beef, onions and garlic all together, I brown them separately. I start with a splash of olive oil and brown the sausage under med-high heat. Once nice and browned I take out the meat and grease and return the pan to the heat. I add a bit of red wine and deglaze the pan. Once all alcohol is boiled out, I reserve for the rest of the liquids. I then clean the pan and do the same w/ the beef. After the beef, I drain the fat and deglaze again. Add the onions and garlic, cooking until translucent. Deglaze again. Then add the spices and all liquids.  Mnnnnn... So good!-

I have the BEST trick for this sauce.  When it begins to simmer, steep about 10 whole cloves in the sauce with one of those colander type things that hang of the side of the pot.  Keep it there about 30-45 minutes, it adds such amazing flavor.

my family LOVED this sauce. This is definitely my go-to recipe for spaghetti sauce...I will not go back to a jar sauce again. I have made this in bulk and frozen it in ziplock bags too. It was great to have it right on hand when I needed to whip up a quick meal.

Fantastic.  Loved it!!  I can't eat sauce from a jar because of the sodium so I made it with all "no salt added tomato" products and it was great.  I used someone else's idea and put it in the crock pot.  so easy

This is really very good.  We are not huge sausage lovers but it does add a wonderful flavor.  I use half sausage and half ground beef.  Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

Absolutely divine! I follow the recipe exactly, only I fry up Italian sausage in the pan along with 1 whole bell pepper and onion (chopped) and once it comes to a boil, I toss it in my crockpot and let it slow cook for 5+ hours-- delish! I use this sauce recipe for the Baked Ziti recipe and just regular pasta dish. Recommend!

I thought this was great! I didn't have any tomato paste, so I added more tomato sauce and water. I also used 2 kinds of sausage, mild and hot, and also added more of both than the recipe called for. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I just added more basil. I also added more garlic, 3 cloves, and more onions just because I like them so much! I will make again...easy and my family loved it.

This was a good base recipe for the kind of sauce I was looking for. I made the following changes: used ground turkey and hot turkey italian sausage. I also sauteed some onion, bell pepper and garlic and threw that into the crock pot with all the tomato stuff and seasonings. After that I added some ground turkey that I had slightly cooked with salt, pepper, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. I also added in the sausage after cooking that and removing the skins (i'm picky about my meat). I let it sit in the crock pot on LOW LOW LOW for about 4 hours until we were ready to eat it. It was reaaaaalllllly good and I will definitely be making again. The BF said it was the best (ok..ok..albeit..only) homemade spaghetti sauce he's ever had :P

While I'm not sure that this is the world's best pasta sauce (that's certainly saying a lot and covering a lot of ground!), I must say that this is a very, very good one!  After about half an hour, I tasted this and it was still a little sweet and acidic for our tastes, so I added a splash of worcestershire sauce, a package of Lipton dry onion soup mix, and probably about 1/2 - 1 tsp. garlic powder.  It was awesome!  This may not be the world's BEST pasta sauce, but it's certainly in the running!

Very easy to make, a little bland.  Next time I will add capers and garlic to balance the tomatoes' sweetness and add flavor.  Excellent recipe, though!

This is a very good, easy way to make homemade pasta sauce.  I doctor it by adding fresh basil and oregano,  mushrooms, green pepper, and brown sugar.  I also squeeze the meat out of the italian sausage casings instead of slicing and leave some nice big chunks in there.  Very Yummy!

Very good sauce...  Only substitutions I made: red wine in place of the water - and used Sweet Italian "turkey" sausage instead of pork sausage.  Next time I will try this sauce with the lasagna recipe!

This is THE sauce that I usually make (when I'm not experimenting with other sauce recipes from this site).  So far, nobody's else's sauce even compares to John's.  Thanks for great sauce and great lasagna!

I agreed that it was a little to meaty for my tastes. But my husband liked the meatiness. I thought that sauce was a little bland. I added some garlic salt and that really gave it some flavor. Next time I think I will add some crushed red pepper for zest.

This sauce is great.  I make it all the time now instead of buying it in the jar.  I cook the meat, garlic, and onion (I used fresh onion instead of minced)and then I add it to the rest of the ingredients in the slow cooker.  Set it on low and let it cook all day.  I did change a couple of things though just for personal preference.  Instead of the crused tomatoes, I add a can of Italian Style chopped tomatoes.  I like the chunks of tomatoes and the seasonings in the tomatoes are great.  I also use the bulk sweet italian sausage instead of the links.  This is the greatest sauce I have ever made.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Incredible sauce - I am making your lasagna, and the sauce is just perfect.  I substituted red wine for the water and wish I had more fresh spices on hand for this.  Thank you so much for posting both recipes - think of the number of people who have loved this recipe (just don't think of the number of pounds gained because of this recipe!!!)  Thank you John!

I'm sure you can find a better sauce if you used all fresh herbs and gutted out the tomatoes, but this one is a great recipe for those of us who need a great sauce from canned tomatoes and the spice cabinet. Very happy with it!

I increased the garlic to 5Tbsp, beef to 3lbs used 1 cup instead of 1/2 and used 2 packages of sweet sausage. (Do not pre-cook meats.) 
         The recipe is amazing, It fed my family of 7 and gave me 4 quarts of leftover sauce.  
         I plated it with garlic bread,  0.5lbs of a quality Linguini and freshly shaved parmesan cheese.  

P.S. I used french bread and a garlic spread for the GB. & topped it with a lite dusting of Italian seasoning.

It's delicious and has had wonderful reviews everytime I've made it.  I honestly don't think I'd make any changes to it. Just an aside, I have always made lasagna with the normal lasagna noodles but have switched to the fresh lasagna pasta 'sheets' located in the dairy cooler. MUCH BETTER. Kicks it up another level. Try it.

Make sure to use SWEET Italian sausage. I tried regular Italian sausage and it didn’t taste the same without sweet sausage.

First thing is thank you so much for this incredible recipe! I’m a newbie when it comes to cooking. I had so time so I tried this recipe and I followed the video the instructions with only changing the sweet sausage to hot sausage. It came out incredibly delicious. I have been always been buying those ready pasta sauces from the store, never again! I simply make this and freeze the rest in small batches so I can use it later on. Again thank you so much for this incredible recipe

WOW was this good! I omitted the fennel seed bc I hate black licorice and anything that tastes like it. I also added 1/3 cup of red wine & 1 packet of pizza peppers (about 1 tsp red peppers). I probably put too much meat in (I mean, what was I going to do with 1/4 lb of ground beef? I had it pre-packaged in 1 lb packages in my freezer), so I ended up adding another can of tomato sauce to make it less thick. I also used diced tomatoes instead, bc I was making it for spaghetti & thought the whole tomatoes might make it more difficult to eat. 

My friend's kids loved it SO much that they were calling me Miss Chef and saying they wanted to come to my house for dinner more often! This will be made again in my house for sure!!

Spaghetti has been my favorite meal since I was probably 5 years old, so I've tried a lot of sauces over the years, always looking for The One. I found this and made it exactly as suggested except for two things: 
1) I took the onion and pureed it with the tomato sauce because I can't stand any pieces of onion but I like the flavor.  
2) I accidentally used moose breakfast sausage instead of regular ground moose in place of the ground beef! But the sausage was mild enough to where I don't think its a huge difference. I don't eat beef so I will keep substituting it with wild meat or turkey.  
I have to tell you, after 33 years of searching, I am done. This is going to be the go-to spaghetti sauce recipe for me! Thank you so much for sharing.

Great recipe and will make it again.  I made a few modifications after the first try, such as I substituted the water for red wine, more garlic, and a yellow bell pepper.

Fantastic pasta sauce!  I've made it several times as written and have also added some wine other times.

This is a great foundation to riff off of... I always use wine instead of water and OMIT the sugar and fennel seed. Add more garlic and a few tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil. Sometimes I add 1/4-1/2 cup parmesan. I’ve made it meatless using mushrooms and lentils. You could add handfuls of spinach or kale. It’s fantastic. Definitely one for the recipe box.

I followed the recipe mostly. I used sliced stewed tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes for chunkier texture, and I mashed them some as it cooked. I didn’t have any tomato sauce, so I used vegetable broth to thin out the mixture a little. I coarsely chopped the onion, again for a chunkier texture. I didn’t pay attention to the portions on seasoning and just seasoned to taste. I used this as a sauce for spaghetti, and ate only a couple of servings. I’m a single guy with no kids, this was a lot of sauce to have left over. Fearing that the spaghetti noodles would “gum” up if refrigerated them separately, I decided to mix the rest of the sauce with the rest of the noodles, topped it off with an Italian cheese blend and baked it for about a half hour. It’s been great as leftovers for lunch.

I doubled the recipe and it turned out great, I put the sauce in my lasagna and the flavor blended perfectly with everything! I will definitely be using this again! My one caveat is that next time I would replace the water with red wine.

Just like the name-- best pasta sauce ever!   I did have one change, only because I didn't have enough tomato sauce, so I added a can of pizza sauce.

This is the best Pasta Sauce I have ever come across.  I made it last week and used it for spaghetti and lasagna.  Lots of raves from my friends.  
The only thing I did different was, instead of using water in the recipe, I used a nice red wine I had on hand. 

Thanks for sharing!

I loved this sauce. It is my go to recipe. I did tweak it a little as I don't lije Italian seasoning. There is something in it that I just can't stand. I use oregano, thyme and bay leaf instead.

First time I made this, it was outstanding!  I add celery and bell peppers to the mix and instead of water I use red wine.  The second time, I added the veg as I usually do, but this time it needed a second 14 oz can of tomato sauce.  Also, I cannot remember if the first time I added the sugar as called for, but the second go around I did, and the sauce is way too sweet for my tastes.  Next time, no sugar will be added!

The sauce was a huge success. Did not have fennel, but I added fresh herbs (basil, oregano, thyme)  and wine because, well, wine! I only had ground beef.   Everyone was asking for seconds.

WOOOOOOW! This sauce is amazing! I added and tweaked a little to the recipe, but not much. It was delicious! I wish my house always smelled like it does now. 

Added: an extra clove of garlic, 1/4 red chili flakes, 1/2 tsp oregano.

I’ve. I’ve been looking for just the right pasta sauce for a long time and have finally found it. Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I added 1/2 tsp. Oregano and two bay leaves.  This is my go to recipe from now on.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! I wasnt paying attention and added a whole onion instead of just a half cup, but it was still delicious! I'm looking forward to trying it again, maybe without the sugar just because I'd like to eliminate sugar from my diet. I do think it's a great recipe as is.

My go to homemade sauce.  I make this in big batches and freeze it.  Instead of water, I use broth but other than that, I use the recipe as is.

I use this sauce for so many things. It's delicious as is, but I have modified a little now. For the meat I use spicy ground sausage (no ground beef) and red wine instead of water. It's so easy I'll never ever buy jar sauce again.

Made it! OMG, delicious! I used Rigatoni instead, made a salad and bought some Italian bread, that was it! Oh, red wine - of course! 
I followed the receipt accordingly with ONE exception! I put in a 1/2 cut of red burgundy  wine and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed paper flakes. Sorry, but,  that is just force of habit whenever I make sauce. I
So, my suggestion to this receipt would be to add those two ingredients !

I made this exactly as directed but omitted the fennel seeds. It was the best meat sauce my family has ever had! Simple, straightforward, and delicious. By the way, my daughter-in-law is Italian and comes from a long line of amazing cooks-she said this recipe was right up there with the best her grandmother ever made and her grandmother’s recipe took hours and hours to complete.

This was delicious! I didn't have any sausage so I only used ground beef. I only cooked it for 20 minutes because I was in a rush, but it still tasted really good. I'm sure it would be even better simmered longer.
I will make this again!

I used 4 cloves garlic instead of 2.  I added Kosher salt and ground pepper to taste to the meat & onions as it was cooking.  Then checked the flavor after adding tomatoes and paste.  I didn’t have Italian seasoning, so I used freshly dried Rosemary from my garden and some Mexican Oregano I had on hand.  It was DELICIOUS !!

I thought it was a great sweet Italian sauce. I don’t like sweet tho so I added oregano, garlic powder, chives and crushed red pepper. That got the sweet taste out and made it perfect for me. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I make a giant batch of this recipe and save portioned leftovers in the freezer . It keeps well through thawing and everyone seems to enjoy it too. It’s definitely my go-to red sauce.

I made a few tweaks. A homemade Italian sausage. Red wine blend, instead of water. Substitute herbs of Provence instead of Italian seasoning. Finally , fresh basil, fresh oregano, fresh sage, fresh thyme during the last 15 minutes of the simmer. Served with homage pasta.

This tasted great and the whole family really liked it. Omitted the chopped tomatoes and doubled the tomato sauce, personal preference. After reading the reviews I will try adding the wine and bay leaves next time but  could definitely eat this again without any changes. Great recipe, thank you x

This was a good, thick sauce, probably because of all the tomato paste. I didn't have any sausage or fennel, but it seemed  fine. I'm sure the sausage would make it spicier. I'll try that next time.

I have been using this site for years to get inspiration on new recipes, but this is the very first review I’ve taken the time to write. I first found the World’s Best Lasagna recipe and it was such a HUGE hit with my family and friends! Naturally, I made this recipe with homemade fettuccini noodles (my Italian in-laws take their Italian food very seriously). It’s FANTASTIC! You can make as-is for a wonderful sauce, and over time I have modified a couple of things just based on personal preference. I use brown sugar instead of white, red wine (usually a medium to bold) instead of water, add garlic powder to the meat when I’m cooking it, and add a 1/2 tsp each of oregano, rosemary, cinnamon, and nutmeg. John, you are the BEST! Thank you for sharing your recipes.

Entirely too sweet for us and I didn't even us all it called for. Not enough onion, garlic or spices for my taste. Ended up throwing it since no one would eat it.

I made it by following the directions and omitting the addition of fennel seed like the other reviews suggested. I really enjoyed it! My friends also tried it and loved it. This is a great homemade pasta recipe.

I cooked a lot for myself when I was single but not much since I married 25 years ago. We have two kids, both of us work and are active. We eat pre-made foods a good deal. This week I decided I wanted to make homemade sauce for Sunday dinner. I found this recipe, read the reviews and off to the store I went. The sauce came out great. I followed the cooking instructions ... very simple. I have a couple non-beef eaters in the house so I substituted ground chicken for the beef and hot Italian turkey sausage (if it can really be called that) for pork. For real meat eaters, this may have been less tasty but for my family it was great. I also only used 1tsp of Fennel. I never cooked with it before so I went easy with it. This is my recipe now for Italian dishes.

I made this with the lasagna first and realized the sauce itself is amazing! Now I make a batch of just the sauce and freeze it for my family! One batch gets us 3 meals! This is a great base and you can or modify as needed. I add a little white wine but otherwise, it's amazing as is

Great pasta sauce, it's the same as the world's best lasagna. So I always have sauce for both recipes. My kids loves it. The good thing is depending on the sausage you use the sauce will taste a little different. Thanks

I swapped a couple of ingredients, using fresh tomato because we grow a lot of them. And take out ground beef. It still came out very yummy. I'll make more to save for winter to come!

I love this recipe, as does my family.  I keep dinner portions frozen so we always have a quick dinner.  I do substitute red wine for water and it adds a depth that is much better, and also use hot Italian sausage instead of mild.    Cannot recommend this enough.

No better pasta sauce recipe in the world!  The only thing I do is add a little cabernet while I'm browning the meats but that's my palate.  You can't go wrong with this incredible recipe!

John, your recipes are awesome.  Made your Lasagna, and it was a huge hit at my house. Now I can make your sauce, store it in the freezer, and have it ready for my pasta dishes anytime. 
As others suggested, red wine is a necessary ingredient  to make this recipe POP!  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this tonight for dinner and it came out great. The only thing I changed was no fennel seed and 1 table spoon of sugar instead of 2. Also crumbled the sausage instead of slicing it. All said and done I will be making this  dish again and maybe try a few new things next time but it is a winner in my book.

Will for sure make again.   I tripled this recipe so I could freeze.

 Now I know what the missing ingredient is in my previous sauces!  Red wine!  The aroma and taste are identical to many good restaurants.  First I reduced about 1/2 c of it with garlic, olive oil, onion and bell peppers.  Then added everything else AND about 1 cup more wine.  (My husband and I don't drink wine but we receive it as gifts.  The fennel seeds add a great flavor.

This is fantastic Sauce! I don't add sugar, I put 3 tbsp of butter in it instead, cuts the bitter of the tomato, but doesn't make it sweet. I make the "Meatball Nirvana" recipe with it, and we have a happy bunch.

I have made this a bunch of times and i really is a superb recipie. Don´t change anything  - to me  the key ingrediens is fennel seeds and italian sweet sausage meat. i havent bee able to find sweet italian sausages in Denmark, so i make the stuffe myself and keep it over night in the fridge in order for the meat (pork) to absorb all the great flavors from the spices.
5 stars!

Yes, world's best.
 To each his own as far as your poor reviews go...sugar,  no sugar, fennel seed this, fennel seed that. Wine vs water....blah blah blah. I have made this sauce several times as is. Everyone loves it, every time! Follow the recipe and you can't fail. Feeling a little confident? Play around with deeper flavors. I think they are asking for your review on THIS not your tweeks. No matter what this is a GREAT recipe and deserves no less than 5 stars.

Wow! I made this tonight for my Italian husband. He was very impressed and we both loved it. This sauce is hearty and perfect! I made it it true to recipe except I didn't add fennel as I had none, and I used premio chicken sausage to lower fat. This sauce will be made again. Thank you Chef John!

Have only made pasta sauce once so have nothing that I've made to compare it to. It's good.  Try it , modify it if you like, but a great place to start.  Everyone at the dinner party loved it.

Very good sauce as others have indicated.  I didn't have all of the sausage on hand so I went with 1/2 beef 1/2 sausage.  Also, we like a little spice so I added some crushed red peppers.  It turned out great - my kids loved it as well.  Thank you for this recipe!

LOVE your recipes Chef John!
This sauce is sweet, flavourful and delicious.
I only added chopped mushrooms for the sake of my two sons who do not eat them otherwise ??

Overall very flavorful but the recipe as written is way too sweet! Taste the sauce and add sugar as you go instead of putting the stated amount in all at once!

Instead of using meat in the recipe, I added organic beef bones which gave the sauce a rich flavor.   I didn't have fennel, either, so it was omitted.  Recipe still tasted good.  Yes, I would make this again.

I agree with Dean about the red wine. I also added a green and a yellow pepper. I also used spicy Italian sausage as I like a little more kick.

Lives up to it's ratings and claims. This is killer Italian red sauce good for Pasta, Lasagna, or pizza sauce. Obviously, slight modifications of meat are necessary depending on your application. The aroma and taste is magnifico!!

Good flavor.  Added some additional spices to kick it up a little.  Cooked a little longer to make it thicker.  Liked it a lot!!

I made this, after my brother made it for us.  He changed the sweet italian sausage to spicy italian sausage.  It was amazing!  We now only use this recipe for our sauce, using spicy italian sausage.  We also take the sausage out of the casing and cook it with the hamburger.  Highly recommend this sauce! One day, I will try it with the sweet sausage.

Really great, I've made it twice and a few adjustments for a spicy version

- double or triple the fresh garlic
- broke up 1lb of spicy Andouille sausage, no beef
- initially threw in red pepper flakes in olive oil to cook with garlic, sausage and onion
- no water, no sugar
- added a couple bay leaves

This can't be the "World's Best Pasta Sauce" recipe because mine is. "Dry" herbs?   All in good jest but when it comes to Italian recipes the title 'World's' Best' is a large umbrella that covers many.

It really is the Worlds Best! I use hot sausage instead of sweet. This is a great sauce if you like your spaghetti sauce thicker.

This is my go - to spaghetti sauce, my husband's all time favorite!  A no fail wonderful pot of sauce, we love it!
I add a few additions, chopped red bell pepper and sliced mushrooms and I grate a carrot in it instead of sugar.
I add crushed red pepper to my portion!
The best!

I've made this sauce many times for Lasagna and decided to try it on spaghetti.  Ohhh Yeaaaaa......

Made a few mods to suit our taste buds.

-1/2 TBS Salt
--Double or triple fresh Garlic
---1 Small sweet onion cut in half and then chopped in 1/8
----1 Cup of Red Wine in place of 1/2 cup water.  

If you're an Italian food lover, you owe it to yourself to try this.

SALUTEE to JohnChandler!

I made this recipe several times and without a doubt, it is the Worlds Best Pasta Sauce. I've made many variations of sauce and they are all good but this one is superb. This is probably the only recipe that I follow exactly. No additional herbs, spices or whatever. Everyone who tries it just raves about my cooking ability. I tell them..."if you can read, you can cook".

Delicious!  I used 1 lb of chicken Italian sausage (no hamburger), added chopped mushrooms and grated carrots at the beginning (with the sausage, onion and garlic) and substituted white wine for the water (that was what I had open).  It was so yummy and very quick/easy to make!! We will definitely make this again.

I've made this sauce a bazillion times for your lasagna and I've never written a review before..   So here goes... It's outstanding!!! How's that?? The great thing about this sauce, is that it makes a large amount, so I always have sauce left over to make other things with it..you can add meatballs, Italian sausage, whatever... Or just as is... Which is excellent all by itself... Thank you for this recipe.. It's the bomb!!

I recently moved and cannot locate my "favorite" red sauce so I tried this one and it was delicious! I made it according to the recipe and served over Kelly Shawn Stewart's Three Cheese Manicotti. YUM!

We absolutely loved this sauce!   It was thick, rich, and had wonderful flavor!  I made exactly as the recipe stated with the addition of a green pepper.  Next time I would add some red pepper flakes for some heat, but, other than that wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Pretty good.  I bought a pound of Italian sausage and also pound of ground beef.  As I started cooking, I just threw all the beef in there.  That being said, that also required an extra can (14.5 oz) of tomatoes.  (I used stewed instead of crushed.)  Also, I added some rosemary - a heaping 1/2 tsp.  I suggest adding a little more sugar, because even with the extra sugar I added to compensate for the tomatoes, I still felt like it wasn't enough.  But in either case, everyone absolutely loved it.  We even used some to make some lasagna.  A warning: in a house of 3 adults and a toddler, it went REALLY fast.  So make sure you have some fruit and veggies on the side.

Amazing recipe. I thought it was really easy to make and turned out to be one of the best dish I ever cooked. I cook once a week and usually mess up but this dish was straight forward. Extremely satisfied with it.

I thought this sauce was very good.  I diced a jalapeno up and tossed it in just because I had one that needed to be used, and I like things spicy.  It added just the right amount of heat.  Crushed red pepper would have done the same thing.

I will make this again!

I made this recipe as written. I thought it was an excellent sauce and will definitely make it again. However next time  I think I will tweak it a little as one rater suggested by adding red wine instead of water, 1/2 teaspoons of oregano and rosemary along with 2 bay leaves.

This had way too much tomato past, and it felt like it was missing something.  I did not add the fennel seeds, so it's possible that could make the difference, but I doubt it, because I hate fennel seeds.  It was missing that richness - that umami taste that the sausage and beef should have given it.  I'm not sure why, but the flavor of the sausage and ground beef didn't transfer over to the sauce, despite simmering for 1-1/2 hours.  It felt like it was missing a spice - maybe a bay leaf or some thyme could fix it?  Overall though, I definitely suggest only using one can of tomato paste if you try this recipe.

My husband and kids loved it!  There's a lot of meat in it, so it really makes a bowl of pasta a full meal!  It makes a lot, we usually have half left over, which is great because it freezes well.

Love this! I used 2 (20oz.) cans of tomato sauce. Couldn't find 6 oz. size. 6 oz. seemed so small anyway! Eliminated the fennel. It was delicious! I will use this recipe from now on.

This is about the best pasta sauce recipe that I've tried.  Thought the addition of fennel was a bit odd, but I loved it.  Next time, I will be adding slightly more fennel seed.

This got great reviews from me and from my family.  (That almost never happens, since my husband and daughter are annoyingly picky.)

My modifications:
1) Omitted the fennel
2) Substituted frozen soy crumbles for the ground beef (They taste better than they sound.  Just add them last.)

Made it last night - knocked my wife's socks off! Only change was to use half red wine, half water and to add water as it simmered to keep it thinned.

I thought the sauce was way too thick, didn't need that much tomato paste. I used a 19-ounce package of Johnsonville Italian sausage and 3/4 pounds of ground beef. I'll probably make this again but use less tomato paste or maybe diced tomatoes instead of crushed Not the World's Best  Sauce to me! Sorry.

This sauce is excellent.  I have been making a sauce that is slightly better but very time consuming.  This recipe is great as is  and much easier to make.  Overtime however, I have altered it a bit.  I only put a pinch of sugar, a 1/4 cup of wine, 1/4 cup of water.  I also only use one can of tomato paste use 1/2 lb hot and 1/2 lb sweet italian sausage.  Very tasty!  Thank you!

Great foundation. I used 1/2 CUP Red Wine instead of Water, and I added 1/2 TSP Parsley, and 1 OZ Dark Chocolate (shaved into the mix 20mins before serving). I also cooked everything in a slow cooker on High for 3.5 hours instead of cooking on the stovetop.

This was my first attempt at homemade sauce and got a "delicious" from my husband. I made it with the ground beef only.  I didn't have fennel seeds but added a few bay leaves instead.  Since there is just 2 of us, I had plenty left over to freeze for later.

The final sauce has perfect consistency--not too stiff but not runny.  My wife asked if I'd made the "meatballs" (aka sliced sausage) myself as they were bite-sized and very tender.  I used oregano because I was out of basil and it tasted great.  It's a great recipe on its own yet has room for individual tweaking depending on tastes.

Could use more onion, garlic, olive oil and wine. Less sugar and water. It could be good with some tweaking.

Delicious! 

The only think I would change is use ground sausage instead of links.  It would blend better with hamburger.  Maybe cut back tomato paste to one can instead of two.

The best!

Great sauce...a little too much meat but that's just me.  Similar to the one I use though I don't think I could write the recipe down...I just wing it and it always comes out fine.

This is very similar to my lasagne sauce recipe. However, if you don't like fennel seeds getting stuck in your teeth, I suggest boiling them in a small pot in about one inch of water, until the liquid is very concentrated. Pour the fennel liquid into the sauce & enjoy the essence without the seeds.

I make  the World Best Lasagna as often as I can using one pound of ground round and one pound of hot italian sausage and have always served the leftover sauce another night over pasta so was glad to see the sauce here on its own.  We also serve it over zucchini noodles to save the carbs and pasta calories!

Ok, I'm a skeptic, I thought this is so easy the reviews must be overblown.  They are not!  This is amazing, and so easy.  I cooked it in the electric pressure cooker, lovely full flavor.

This is one of the best sauces I've made and my go to sauce. My family loves it, and I use ground pork or chicken sometimes as an alternative to italian sausages...

I actually found this sauce in the World's Best Lasagne recipe (I think by the same author) and I loved the sauce part of that recipe so much that I now use this sauce for Spaghetti, Lasagne, and other Pasta main dishes. It's pretty excellent and easy to modify if needed, but wonderful just as is.

This is the main spaghetti sauce that we make now. Sometimes we skip the sausage and it's still excellent and a few less calories. Both ways it is a delicious sauce!

We made this tonight, with a few minor omissions/changes, but it's wonderful and I'd make it again!  Instead of sweet italian sausage we used a package of bangers (no fennel?).  I only used one can of tomato paste, forgot the basil, didn't have fennel, but did add some oregano and a bay leaf as another reviewer did.  Wonderful sauce!

As others have suggested, I made a few minor changes.  I cooked the beef first (no sausage), drained the grease, then set that aside.  I then sauteed the onions and garlic (more garlic, more garlic!) in olive oil and added that, oil and all, to the pan.  Did not add sugar but did add bay leaves and red wine in lieu of water.  Its a nice, thick, tasty sauce.

I am a big fan of the Lasagna recipe this comes from so it's no wonder I like this also. I have made the lasagna at least a dozen times always trying to follow the recipe as closely as possible. The last few times I made it I noticed that it was kind of sweet, so I left out the sugar thinking I could add it later if needed but it was perfect without. I also had some red wine left-over from the night before so substituted that for the water, it was a hit! I used it to top fried polenta and even made the most incredible little personal pizza I've ever had! In my opinion the Fennel Seed it what really makes this dish shine!

It really is the worlds best pasta sauce! I was unable to find sweet Italian sausage, so I used hot.  I also added red pepper flakes (because we love RedPepper) and I used about 4 cloves of garlic (peeled) and kept whole, I wrap those in cheese cloth and let the sauce simmer with the garlic that way.    This is fantastic! I doubled the recipe and it freezes very well.  I doubt I will ever use my old recipe again!

Based on one other review, I also used red wine instead of water.  I used equal portions of beef and pork, and added 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp rosemary, and 2 bay leaves.  I put it in the crock pot on high for 3 hours.  My very picky husband loved it!  This will be my new go-to recipe for spaghetti sauce.

Made with 1 lb sweet Italian and 1/2 lb hot Italian sausage, subbed red wine for water, and added 1/2 tsp oregano. Came out very good--will def try again. Thanks to OP and other posters.

(1/30/16 EDIT: Bumped to 5 stars. This is my go-to Sunday sauce recipe. Thanks again to OP and other posters.)

Definitely the worlds best pasta. So delicious. I took advice from other reviews to add fresh basil, and red pepper flakes. I think those two ingredients were key. I would definitely make it again.

Like many other reviewers, I added and changed a bit, but this is a good recipe to start with if you've never made a tomato sauce before. I didn't add the sugar (the tomatoes are sweet enough!), and used wine instead of water. Put some olive oil in and added way more garlic and basil. Turned out great! Will try in the crock pot next time to give everything more time to meld together.

I use this recipe as a base for all my pasta sauces.  I do add a few things depending on its final use.  Fresh mushroom, green pepper and red wine are good additions.  I tried something different last time.  I doubled recipe and added hot cherizo sausage in addition to the Italian.  Sounds weird, but came out great!

I think this is the best meat sauce.  Made it last year for the lasagna and got rave reviews, now I make extra and freeze it for later use.  Like other reviews I add red wine in place of the water and it makes a difference. Thanks for a great sauce!

I have made this sauce a few times. I did modify the sugar. I used a teaspoon then another pinch. Do not use 2 teaspoons, too sweet. It took me forever to bring it back when I did do that. I also added more than a pound of sausage. I make this for my lasagna and spaghetti. Wonderful!! A+++++++

Basic recipe is great but I like spicier taste so use hot Italian sausage, equal amount of ground beef, red wine instead of water and I use Splenda instead of sugar (type 1 diabetic). My mother in law is Italian and makes good sauce but my wife prefers this and stopped making her Mom's.

I made this sauce for supper tonight and will agree with others that it is very good.  It is very similar to my sauce.  Next time I make it I will add red wine instead of water, a few more cloves of garlic and a only a teaspoon of sugar.  (Like my mother used). I thought it was a bit sweet.  It also makes a large pot so I had two quart containers for the freezer.  Thanks for a great recipe

This is the perfect pasta sauce for all of your red sauce dishes.  I follow the recipe exactly as written and it always comes out excellent.  I do not use any other recipes for my sauce.  This is superb.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.

I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT I tripled the black pepper. I also didn't have fennel. Great recipe. Nice sweet, flavorful sauce. I needed a good pasta sauce recipe and found a great one. Like all good sauces it's even better the second day.

The pasta sauce is great. I made half of the of the recipe. I had modified it with bison meat instead of sausage. I also added to the recipe oregano and fennel seed. You must try it, if you like the spices and meat I had included in the sauce. It turned out delicious.

I made this sauce and used it on Penne. My husband loved it...but for me it was just O.K. I also used hot Italian sausage because we like that better. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this sauce many times and LOVE it!   I was challenged to a pasta sauce cook-off this weekend by a neighbor and and whole street did a blind taste test.  It was a landslide!  This sauce won it and the challenger only got one vote (pity vote, likely).  The only thing I add is based on other reviewers...I add a pinch of red pepper flakes, some oregano, and bay leaf.  THE BEST SAUCE!!!

I made the sauce for the lasagna and it was so yummy!  So I decided to make it for spaghetti today!  The most fantastic sauce, only change was I did not add the fennel (I really don't like fennel)!! Oh and I added fresh basil instead of dried!!  Amazing!!!

After calling it quits to jarred pasta sauces, can't find one that doesn't have a weird aftertaste. I was soo happy to stumble across this recipe. My only changes are I use Chicken or Turkey Italian Sausage (the hubby doesn't eat piggy) and no fennel. I also add the tomato paste to the meat/onion mixture (after its browned) and cook until dark reddish brown. Then add remaining ingredients. I make a double batch and freeze in freezer baggies.

I love this sauce!  I've made it several times and it is consistently good and easy to make.  I've also made the Worlds Best Lasagna, also by this chef.  It was very well received at my churches pot luck and made enough sauce that i froze a second one.  I'm trying it in my crock pot today- browned the meat with the onions and garlic, then added everything to the crock pot to cook all day.  Can't wait to try it tonight!

Great recipe! I had never made a home-made sauce before and this was easy to follow and easy to modify. I recommend extra garlic as well as many of the other reviewers. I used Ground Turkey & also included some olive oil and it was excellent. I will continue to use this recipe and modify for years to come!!!

This is a great recipe and easily modifiable. I used 1lb ea of the meats, used ground sausage, 2 tblsp coconut sugar (in place of red wine) and my own herbal mix. I omitted the extra salt and fennel seed because the sausage has plenty in it.  I love how the recipe doesn't take 4+ hours to make. Next time going to make a chunky version of this. Thank you for sharing!

I made this sauce yesterday with a few changes. I added 2 tsp of oregano and 2 bay leaves. I also added 2 14.5 cans of tomato sauce, instead of 2 6.5 and let it simmer for 3 hrs.  It was excellent! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Excellent recipe... although I couldn't rate as a five without green peppers, red pepper and mushrooms.  I added those because they're requirements to my family in a pasta sauce.  I also added a bit more of the Italian spices.  I think that depends on the brand of tomato sauce used, as some include a bit more spice or garlic, onions, meaning you have to taste and adjust to your liking.

I loved this recipe. Very simple and basic Italian  ingredients and yet the end product was way better than any other recipes I've tried. Thumbs up and will cook again and again.

"4-stars" 'cause he left out 'shrooms (skillet -browned baby bellas) and sub a "sippable" red (Cabernet) for plain ol' water!!  Oh..."penne rigata" pasta: the grooves positively "grab" the sauce when you toss in a little before plating!

This sauce is amazing. I like to dice/ brown up a 1lb of boneless pork chops in a little olive oil and minced garlic; omit the ground meat and instead make the meatballs Nirvana recipe (also on this site) and plop them into the sauce with the shredded pork for added flavor.  I also add about a half cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the sauce as it is simmering.  I was short 1 can of paste the last time I made this and didn't even notice the difference. Love love love this sauce. Thanks for sharing :)

Such a great base that you can tweak depending on what you have available at home.  You really can't go wrong.

This sauce was delicious.  I did make sure my sausages did not have added fennel. Overall a great sauce.

This really is the Best Pasta Sauce...with that being said I did change it just a smidge to suit my taste. Used red wine for the water and added a 1/2 teaspoon of oregano...other than that I wouldn't change a thing. This is my permanent go to pasta sauce. Thanks Johnchandler for the awesome recipe.

I'm making it for the third time. I made a couple of changes in the beginning to correspond with my diet requirements. I substituted Splenda, 3 packets instead of sugar and I use "no salt added" tomato sauce and withhold any additional salt. I use chicken or turkey and lean ground pork instead of beef and sausage. I add sliced black and green olives and cook it low and slow in a Crock Pot. Like others, I will never use store bought pasta sauces again.

I'm glad to see that he posted just the sauce by itself, not because the lasagna isn't wonderful (we've always gotten rave reviews from all of the people we've made it for), but because I use the extra sauce on my pasta.  As the guy in the house who can't eat cheese, I miss out on the lasagna my family loves, but I can't recommend this sauce enough.  The only thing I add to the pasta afterwards, other than the sauce, is a bit of freshly toasted pinenuts.  You can't go wrong.  The one thing we do do differently is use only ground beef, and simmer it on low in the crockpot for 10-12 hours. Your house will smell amazing!

This really is my favorite. I make a double batch and freeze with Seal-a-Meal so I can just pop the bag in some simmering water for quick meals. Don't leave out the fennel seeds - they add so much flavor. Also a great lasagna sauce. Definitely restaurant quality.

I didn't add that much sugar--I used 6 28oz cans of crushed tomatoes--the next time I'll just add maybe 3 tablespoons.  I had added 4 T and found it too sweet--I didn't follow recipe completely though.  I just used crushed tomatoes and left out the tomato paste since I had so many cans of the crushed.  I never follow a spaghetti sauce to the "t".  I always modify it to suit the ingredients I have on hand.  I'll keep this one though but like I said I won't use that much sugar.  I didn't put that much spices in it either--maybe half.

The very first time I made your lasagna, this became the ONLY sauce we use! We make big batches and freeze it in individual servings to use with various pasta dishes. We use Italian sausage from our very favorite Italian meat market here in Dallas and it never disappoints!! I love your recipes Chef John!

Good, basic recipe. Its certainly a good recipe to build upon. I had to add more than the recommended sugar to make it tastier. I also added more of just about every spice listed bc it was bland.

I would definitely give this a 5! even after modifying it any way you want...the base is just amazing!...I cut the salt...good amount for the lasagna version of this, but a little too much for the sauce version. I LOVE JOHN CHANDLER!

First let me say, I like the simplicity of this before even trying the recipe.  Had everything we like in it.  We live in a rural area, so quick trips to a market are not an option.
This is SO good. It made my house smell SO good. It made my family SO happy. Only one problem - NO leftovers.  Thank you for a fantastic feast on a nasty Sunday afternoon. Like others, the compliments, and requests for the recipe just keep coming.  WAY TO GO Johnchandler. A big thank you from rural Texas is coming your way.

Ever since I found John's recipe for "World's Best Lasagna" (a must try if you haven't already done so), I've been using the sauce portion of that recipe for my meat sauce. The only minute changes I make for the sauce only are 1) I leave out the fennel seed, and 2) I add a chopped jalapeno, seeds, membranes and all for a little zing. I also give it a quick mix with a submersible blender to puree it a bit. One other change I'd like to note: If you read the lasagna recipe, it doesn't say to drain the meat after browning with the onion and garlic (and jalapeno in my version). I never have drained off the fat and the sauce still never comes out greasy. I just can't see sacrificing the onion, garlic and jap flavors to drain off the fat. If you are going to drain, I would suggest adding the onion and garlic afterward. This really is a fantastic sauce recipe that you absolutely must try. Thank you John!

I thought this was really good. Someone mentioned that with fennel sausage it would be over kill adding the extra fennel. The recipe does not say to use sausage with fennel so if that poster used both it would of been her mistake. Also, I always put red wine in mine along with a little sugar. I always taste and see if I need more of anything to my liking, that's how you get the sauce you want, by tasting and adjusting to your taste.

I stayed pretty close to this recipe as is, just didn't have any fennel on hand and used ground Italian sausage instead of sliced. I could eat this sauce plain, it's so good! I'm excited to try experimenting with ratios and other ingredients but as is I still give it a 5/5.

Very good base recipe.  Easy to make alterations and still come out very good.  As many others did, I made several changes according to my taste.  Definitely better than anything we get around the Clearwater, Fl area in the restaurants.  I'll be making this often.  Thanks for posting.

This was an amazing recipe that I use often when making Italian food in need of a red sauce. I find it helpful to simmer the meats in a muscadine red wine (just a splash, or two, or three... depending on your love of wine!) because the addition gives it real character that is noticeable in the finished product. Hope this helps! :)

This is almost identical to the one 'in my head' for 40 years. But I don't 'get' the sugar :( since tomatoes have sooooo much sugar in them already. I would never add sugar. The few flakes of crushed red pepper is a nice touch. Bravo.

I have searched so long for a pasta sauce that the whole family would agree on.  This is the one.  It is so yummy and easy to prepare.  I add oregano, and substitute extra tomato sauce for the tomatoes because that is my family's preference.  I also leave out the meat, and put it all in the slow cooker with the Easy Slow Cooker Meatballs recipe also on this website.  I have used it for lasagna too.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I have made it several times with the lasagna and EVERY time people have said how good it is.  Since I couldn't find any sweet Italian sausage and personally I really do not like the taste of sauage, the only change I made was that I boiled the Italian sausage in beer and then chopped it.

This is the best pasta sauce recipe I've found. I worried that the flavor would be bland, but it was FABULOUS! I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef as my family doesn't like sausage. I cooked up the hamburger in the morning and let everything simmer in the crock pot all day.

Very good! I made it for my lasagna dinner, for my birthday. I'm glad I did. I've been meaning  to start making my own sauce for spaghetti rather than the usual Ragu....I didn't use the sausage though.

Made this sauce last night and the family loved it.  As others have suggested, I cooked the sausage and beef (both the lowest fat I could find) together, then removed from the pan and drained on a paper towel.  Cooked the onions and garlic in a little EVOO until wilted then added the tomatoes, sauce, paste and spices.  I did all a 1/4 cup of red wine and about 1/4 cup of water. Let this simmer for about 1/2 hour and added the meat back for the remaining hour. Really liked the fennel.  This one is a keeper!

I adore this sauce. After using it once in Chef John's lasagna recipe I decided that this would become my "go to" spaghetti sauce. All I've ever changed was the sugar- I only use 1 tablespoon.

Left out the Fennel and the sausage. I would use less sugar next time - too sweet or my taste. Always double up the recipe so you can freeze half for another time!

When I first made the 'World's Best Lasagna' a while back after I cooked the sauce it deserved a TEN rating by itself. It to me is one of the easiest yet very favorable homemade meat sauces and it will definitely go with any pasta of your choice. Another great thing about the sauce as the video stated is the seasoning can be modified to your liking as well. Thanks again John!

Absolutely awesome recipe! This is the only pasta sauce that we use.  I usually double or triple the recipe, add fresh basil instead of dried and let simmer for several hours.  I've even tried it with honey garlic sausage (couldn't find any mild Italian at the time - and it was quite tasty. Thanks John for a great recipe!

I made the World's Best Pasta Sauce for the very first time last night. It was very good. My family enjoyed it very much. I am not a big fennel fan so the next time I will add a little less than suggested in the recipe, but I highly recommend this pasta sauce.

This is so good.  I prefer to swap the hamburg and hot sausage amounts, though.  Sometimes I use brown sugar instead of white, fresh basil vs. dried, and red wine instead of water--no matter how it is done, it's a winner.

This was a pretty good sauce. It seemed just a little too thick for my personal preferance, so next time I might add more water or maybe only use one can of tomato paste. It had a really nice flavor! I made this meatless because I put it over meatballs and I definitely plan on making it with the meat too. Thanks for a great recipe!

I make this sauce all of the time and it's made me famous among my family and friends. My diet has changed since I first started making this, so I've made it with ground turkey instead of beef, and also with tofu instead of meat. It's so flavorful, I don't think either of these substitutions makes the sauce taste bad because it's just so good! You obviously want to season to taste - I add much more than called for. I've also cubed up roasted veggies and tossed them in which is delicious!

I've been making this recipe for a long time thanks to John. I love it! I come from an Italian family that takes their sauce seriously and this is the best. No changes need to be made. It's perfect just the way it is. So is John's lasagna recipe from this site. Please submit more recipes John.

This is a very good recipe but there is an addition you can make to it that will make it even richer tasting. Try the Simple Garlic & Basil Pesto By FUZZYGREENMONKEY on this site.  After blending your ingredients, pour into an ice tray, freeze, & when you make your sauce add 1 cube.  Splendid!

Excellent meat sauce. I left out the suasage and used 1 1/2 lb's of ground beef because thats what I had already. there was enough for a pound of pasta, and about 2 quarts left over which I put in the freezer for later. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks.

This was very good, I had been having problems making homemade sauce that my husband approved of, and I really hate using store-bought. This received the stamp of approval, and now will be used quite regularly. I like that it makes a ton, and I can make some in advance and possibly can it, at the very least freeze it. I think the only variations I might try in the future is to use some fresh herbs (basil and Italian parsley), possibly wine, etc. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my! this was absolutely wonderful! everyone loved it. However, I'm not exactly sure about the sugar. I've never put sugar in my sauces and I know that the taste copied the ones that are ready made in the store; but I particularly am not partial to sugar. My dad flipped out when he found out that I put sugar in it. But it still tasted excellent. I also added, when you brown meat and onions, a stalk of celery...excellent! =)

Made this sauce first time, I didn't have all the ingredients, so I skipped fennel seed and instead of italian sausage I used ground beef. I also added about 1oz of red wine. The sauce is just great, I am sure once it seats for a little bit it will be even better. I made a lot of it, so after dinner I will make lasagna with the rest and freeze it for next time.

This is very similar to what I make, except I usually use puree instead of the tomato sauce, and I simmer for almot 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours. I think the fennel is what really sets it apart, and gives it that extra dimension in flavor. Thanks so much for sharing

This sauce is great on spaghetti.  I used (2) 8 oz cans of tomato sauce instead of the 6.5 oz cans and the recipe still turned very flavorful.  This one is a keeper!

I love a thick sauce so this was perfect for my family. I made meatballs and used the sliced sweet sausage. Inexpensive as compared to a good jar sauce and so much better. Super easy too!

This recipe has all the essentials to please the senses. I personally like to add a third cup of jelly - natural sugar because I like my sauce sweeter. Aside from that, I have now made this sauce over thirty times and it has always turned out just as perfecct as the first time.....You won't regret it, and you won't forget it, trust me.

This truly is the world's best pasta sauce.  When I made the lasagna (which my family loved and is now our go to lasagna recipe) one of the comments that I made in my review was that I couldn't wait to try the sauce in some other pasta dishes. I have since used it several times, and every time it is outstanding, and brings out the best of whatever it is complimenting.  Excellent!  Thanks again.

I have made this sauce a few times now and it's great as-is.  I did substitute red wine for water this time and I did not care for it as much.  It deepens the flavor but I like mine to taste a little more "fresh" so that didn't do it for me.  I'll switch back to the original next time.  ;)

A very, very good recipe. I made this for dinner last night using just 1lb. of Mild Italian Sausage. Next time I might use spicy italian instead since it was a little to sweet for my taste.  However, it was still delicious. :-) A keeper for sure.

Love this sauce!  Used meatloaf mix and added a handful of finely diced carrots to the onion/garlic mix and omitted the fennel.  Used Muir Glen tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Very good sauce.

This is a keeper. I have tried many recipes and this is  the best so far. I added some red pepper flakes for a little heat. I also halfed the amount of meat. I froze the other half I alread browned for the next batch. YUMMY

Didn't change a thing, it was perfect! My husband is Italian and is very fussy over his sauce, even he gave it 5 stars - so thank you!

This is the "World's Best Pasta Sauce"!  I made it last night for friends and it was a big hit!  The store didn't have sweet Italian sausage so I used mild.  We had it for lunch today and it was even better.  I can't wait to make the lasagna!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was my first time making my own sauce and I loved it!  My fridge and pantry were quite bare, but this was a great way to use up those wierd things like tomatoe paste that I buy and never use!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent sauce recipe.  This was my first attempt with homemade pasta sauce.  My FIL had a bountiful tomato crop this year, so the only change I made was subbing fresh peeled and seeded tomatoes instead of canned.  We had him over for dinner and he approved!

I had been looking up his lasagna recipe just for the sauce. It's the best. I use 1.2 pounds turkey sausage, and omit the ground beef. I've also made it meatless. I like to add a bit extra rosemary. I recommend eating it over a whole wheat pasta and topping with jack cheese.

This is great pasta sauce. It has a  very traditional taste. To add a kick, add red pepper flakes.

This was my first attempt at making homemade sauce, and I can say it was a success. I made this for my wife's family and they all said it was very good, and some requested leftovers. I thought it seemed as though it needed a little extra something, but not sure what it might be. I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. Next time I will try adding lots more garlic, a little more basil, and maybe some oregano. The only change I made was to use a quart of my homegrown crushed roma tomatoes instead of the store bought stuff.

This is my new favorite.  I've already made three batches.  I think I like it best with the mild sausage instead of sweet, although this time I mixed the two.  I want to try it with a little oregano next.

John Chandler's Lasagna is the World's Best!  Ever since I have been making this, my husband wants me to make it once a week (I make it every other week)and he invites people over for dinner.  I started doubling the recipe and save half for pasta sauce as it is as good for pasta sauce as it is for lasagna.

Great recipe! I didn't have Italian sausage so instead added breakfast sausage patties, mashed, two drops of liquid smoke for flavour and 1/4 tsp. sage. (to mimic italian sausage flavour)  Was delicious and had enough leftovers to freeze for use with lasagna next time.

Truly a great sauce. I omitted the ground beef, opting for all ground sausage. The longer it cooks, the better it gets.

I made the sauce with turkey sausage.  (Don't laugh; it's good stuff.)  It was amazing.  My husband loved it, despite the lack of fat.

every time i cook this sauce, i go all sausage while slicing half of it and taking the other half of the meat out of the links and pulling it apart. i find that this adds an entirely new flavor to the sauce, especially if you use different types of sausages, such chicken-apple, artichoke, or pesto-infused ones. last time i added a habanero-garlic sausage which really gave a fantastic kick to the sauce- my family and i finished the leftover sauce on its own! either way, you can't go wrong with this one.

10 stars, awesome. Instead of 28oz can tomatoes, I used 1 large ball jar of tomatoes my mother canned over the summer, put them in the blender, fresh basil, only 1/2 lb sausage and 1 lb hamburger, cooked meat, onion and garlic together: added rest of ingred. to crock pot and added meat mixture, low 5 hours awesome, thanks

This has become my staple pasta sauce.  My family loves it!  The only change I make is two use only ground meat (no sausage) and substitute one can of roasted garlic tomato paste in place of one of the plain pastes.  It just gives a little more of a garlic kick.

Very good recipe and great if you want to add things in. Myhusband made this last night for a group of 40 and everyone absolutely loved it! He used mild sausage instead of sweet, but will go for the spicy next time. Wonderful recipe!

I omitted the sausage (personal preference) and I didn't have any fennel seeds, however, this recipe still turned out very good.  I give it a five stars because it was very easy to make and does not require a ton of ingredients!
