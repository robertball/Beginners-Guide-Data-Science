few combinations are as good as peanut butter and chocolate... and this is a great one. the dough isn't too sweet, giving you a good salty hit with the peanut butter. easy to make. next time, i will put all the dough in the bottom and sprinkle roasted peanuts on top. :-)

I followed this recipe like it was the bible (as usual) and I found it worked out really well. Alot of these ingredients are things I have sitting around becoming useless so it was nice to use them up. Just so you know, I suggest putting them in the fridge for atleast 2 hours or the freezer for 30 min or more to let the chocolate set. Plan ahead if you are hoping to serve these as a dessert.

Pretty tasty.  went together without too much trouble - I did ad about another 1/3 cup melted chocolate chips to help finish off the edges.  Don't expect them to be around long once the roomates see they're out...   Subbed in reduced fat PB, didn't seem to cause a problem.

Let's just say that the kids in this house are making these disappear quickly! The peanut butter base/topping is terrific: I'm thinking of trying it as a standalone cookie (sans chocolate).

These were great!  I threw them together at the last minute before going to a friend's for dinner and everyone gobbled them up.  They aren't super sweet and the oats add a nice texture.  I baked mine until the edges began to brown (25min) , let them cool and they slid right out of the pan.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I may have overbaked this by I'm not sure how long. I got distracted by The Who playing at the Super Bowl halftime- they were just too amazing to miss a second! I'm not sure how much better it would have been if it had not been baked as long, but it wasn't bad. It just needed something that I can't put my finger on.

Made these bars on the week end. They were really good but very "oaty" . Will make again but will reduce the oats to about a 1 cup. Also, added crushed roasted peanuts on top. :)

Decent recipe- a fun thing to bring to parties. Not a show-stopper though.

24 minutes in the oven is way too long for these. I would make them again as the flavor was very good, but would check them after 18 minutes or so.

evcellent recipe. I was afraid it might of been to rich, some of the chocolate peanut butter bars can be, but these had a nice taste and texture without being too over powering. I have hid them, as everyone got into them after they cooled, and I want some for Santa Christmas Eve.

These turned out really good! Not too sweet. It was kind of hard to get that first layer to spread, maybe patting down with greased fingers would be easier. Hard to tell when done, so watch for browning on top.

I made these for my daughter's volleyball team, and the pan is empty.  They were devoured.  Simple to make, let them set up overnight and they cut and came out of the pan very cleanly.  Great recipe!

These bars are good, but not the best. I'm going to try other pb bars next time. The crust was crumbley, so they didn't cut well. They are not too sweet. The oatmeal is a good addition, but maybe cut back on it slightly.

Baked for 18 minutes, added 1 cup oatmeal rather than 1-1/2 cup in recipe and it was the perfect amount. I also added a few more tablespoons of chocolate chips for the topping. Not too sweet...very yummy!

Oh My Gosh!  I love these and so did everyone who had them.  I was suprised how well they turned out.  Would have been a 5 star except if you go by the recipe I dont think it had enough chocolate.  I had to double the amount of chocolate.  Taste is great though!
