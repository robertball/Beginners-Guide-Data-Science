Absolutely the biggest hit at our Labor Day family get together! I increased the amounts by about 50% or so using 1/2 reg. and 1/2 plum tomatoes plus 1 red bell pepper in addition to the green one and 2 jalapenos (1 seeded, the other not). Since half was going to be blended anyway I fine chopped 1/2 and the other was course chopped for the blender,saving prep time. Speaking of which, the listed prep time was VERY conservative, more like double for me. Also seeded the cukes and put all seeds in the blender. I think it made for a less watery soup. Served with crusty Italian bread and a bottle of Tobasco sauce on the side and it's a meal itself!

This looked and smelled fantastic while I was preparing it!  My husband doesn't like vegetable chunks, so I pureed the entire thing.  I don't recommend that.  I didn't like the texture without the vegetable chunks.  Also, it was an unappealing brown color because of the red of the tomatoes combined with the green of the bell pepper.  It seems like a red or yellow bell pepper would give this a more attractive color.  Anyway, my husband decided that the gazpacho smelled hideous and he wouldn't eat it, so it's all mine.  It tasted great as a puree, but I added some chunks back in to improve the texture, and it's terrific!  If I make it again, though, I'll try it as a salad without pureeing at all.  UPDATE: I did make this again as a salad.  It was delicious, but there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl, so I guess it does need to be partially pureed to incorporate that liquid.

Out of this World! A lot of chopping but so very worth it! I did add a bit of chopped fresh basil too, out of preference.

Very nice recipe; I modified it with several ingredients I had available - a small beet, carrots, a zucchini, and used mostly cilantro, just a little dill, sherry vinegar instead of balsamic. I pureed only about 1/3 instead of 1/2. But the base recipe would be excellent as-is - I can never leave recipes alone! I'll be amazed if this batch lasts long enough to chill down... Planning to serve with a splotch of either sour cream or yogurt.

This was delicious! I used an orange pepper instead of a green one to save the colour, and used a few drops of Tabasco as I had no jalapenos. I didn't do any chopping either - I kept 4 tomatoes aside and blended them roughly into everything else at the very end, to make sure there were some lumpy bits.

Just finished making this and I had to sample it before putting it in the fridge.  It's excellent!  I didn't use as much dill as it calls for and I also added fresh basil and parsley.  I'm sure once it sits for an hour or two it's going to be even better.

I halved the recipe and substituted some lime juice because I didn't have enough lemon.  It is wonderful!  A great summer dish.  I think next time I will use a yellow or red pepper, to preserve color in the liquid as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also used about a teaspoon of garlic powder, a teaspoon of dried basil and I pureed the entire thing.  It's very very good.

I was just looking for a recipe to use up some dill.  Am I glad I found this one! Delicious.  I used a red pepper rather than green, and didn't have a jalapeno, instead using some hot sauce.  Hubby had never heard of gazpacho, and was very leery of "cold soup," but loved it after he decided to call it "salsa."  He ate his with chips, and I garnished  mine with seasoned croutons.  Restaurant quality for sure.  Thanks for posting.
Update:  If you prepare this thick and chunky, it makes a beautiful company appetizer if you line the bowl with some romaine lettuce, and top with extra dill, croutons and parsley.

This really hit the spot! I've been dying for gazpacho with the warmer weather, and this version won my boyfriend over too. Just a couple of minor adjustments were made: double the salt & pepper, half the onion, and the addition of cilantro. The fresh dill has a wonderfully bright flavor. A very tasty way to get more veggies in my diet... thanks Amy!

My husband wasn't to crazy about the dill, but I personally found it to be absolutely amazing.  What a wonderful way to eat my vegetables.  I added more olive oil and balsamic vinegar and some sour cream and it tasted great.  Will make again and again.

I love good Gazpacho! My hubby was apprehensive, but after tasting it, said it was the best "salsa" he has ever tasted! Oh well, he isn't quite the world traveler that I am!

I lost my favorite recipe for gazpacho and this recipe was the most similar to it. I normally use cilantro but thought the dill would be a nice variation. After trying it, I wasn't that impressed. I didn't think it had as much flavor. I will definitely use this as the base from now on and just switch the herbs. Thanks for the recipe

Wonderful flavor.  I love dill so next time I think I will add a little extra.  This isn't the prettiest gazpacho that I have ever seen, but the flavor makes up for it.

Perfect except too spicy and I'm a 4-star Thai food gal. Use a small jalepeno or eliminate and add pepper flakes to taste.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My supermarket was out of fresh dill, so I just used dried dill weed, and it still had a great flavor.   My only problem was that it was a little watery, probably because I'm not an adept blender-user. Great for a summer lunch.

Mine is chilling now.  I did make a few revisions, I used a red pepper instead of green for color.  I added 2 minced cloves of garlic and used 2 lemons instead of one since I like things tart.  As another reviewer did, I used one jalapeno seeded and one not seeded for the added zip.  Deeelish!!

Wonderfully fresh and delicious. I used onion and bell pepper that I bought already chopped and a tube of dill that you find next to the fresh dill. It worked great. Very pleased. Threw it all into the blender in two batches.

This was amazing.  I made it without the jalepeno as I don't really like spicy food.  So easy and great flavor!  Can't wait to make it for summer get-togethers.

This is an excellent gazpacho recipe.  My husband is a soup fanatic and he loves this.  Chill the bowls first and it makes an elegant first course.

This really made a perfect gazpacho and the dill is a nice touch. You could add some pepper flakes if you like it spicy.

Dill makes a nice alternative to the classic basil. I have found a meat grinder makes short work and the best consistency for gazpacho. Thanks.

Didn't make any changes, and it was great! Not quite the "soup-like" consistency  I was looking for, but the flavor was awesome! AND...it won first place in the soup contest at the county fair!

I doubled the recipe and enjoyed it. A great way to use up those extra tomatoes from the garden. Only thing I changed was adding some garlic which I chopped and tossed in the blender.  I served it over some sliced avocado. Mmm

Living in the Southwest, I love a good gazpacho.  This wasn't one of them.  Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out like pico de gallo, with cucumber and dill added in.  Not a good gazpacho at all.

Quick and easy.  Delicious  way to use up ripe tomatoes and  cucumbers .  I didn't have fresh dill so I used dried and added fresh basil and cilantro, because why not?  I didn't chop things all that finely, so I pulsed the whole thing a few times and then puréed 1/2, as directed.

Didn't really have the time or the patience to finely chop the vegetables, so I pureed the whole thing. So yummy! The dill was fantastic :)

I didn't have any onion or green bell pepper so I substituted finely chopped celery.  Also added an extra jalapeno.  Tastes great!

Awesome recipe, the balsamic, lemon, jalapenos and dill create the best flavors. I puree about 2/3 and leave 1/3 chopped. I added 2 chopped celery stalks, 1 chopped red pepper and shreeded carrots.
Perfect!
