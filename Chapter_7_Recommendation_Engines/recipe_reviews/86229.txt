When I first made this recipe, my husband and I didn't like it too much. But something told us to try again, and it was a huge success. Here's how we made a recipe that we liked (and so did our family): 

1. Cut the celery into small pieces and use two sticks instead of the one it calls for (this way, every bite has crunch) 

2. We usually prefer green onions over red, white, yellow, etc. But in this case, we found that the extra crunch added by these varieties are essential. We used white onions instead of green, and that made a world of difference. Make sure to mince or dice very small; again, to get some onion in every bite. Eliminate the onion powder.

3. It was too vinegar-y for our taste, so we cut the vinegar down to 1/2 cup and that yielded a better balance with the oil. 

4. Use olive oil, not veg oil

5. Use real minced garlic instead of garlic powder

6. Add salt

7. store the salad in tupperware that you can flip upside down, without leakage. Rotate it at least twice during the marination process.

8. After the salad has had a chance to marinate over night, drain off the excess dressing; otherwise the beans at the bottom will start to degrade.

This sounds like more work than it is, and trust me the result is well worth it!

This is the best bean salad recipe I've tried in a very long time.  I made a couple of substitutions - I used 2 Tbsp. of red onion for crunch instead of celery and then omitted the onion powder.  I also substituted 1 lg. clove of garlic for garlic powder and added 1 tsp. of chopped chives.  The dressing is perfect; not too sweet, just the right tang and the cayenne adds just the right amount of heat.  This has definitely become my favorite.

I would rate this 6 stars = "can it get any better?" This recipe is definitely a "keeper"

I made this yesterday with a few changes and got rave reviews from my friends.   Substituted lima for garbanzo, medium sweet onion sliced thin for the green onions, medium green pepper chopped for the celery, olive oil instead of veggie oil and 1 clove garlic pressed for the powder.  Didn't use onion powder or cayenne pepper. I would recommend to refrigerate it for at least 4 hours and flipping it over or stirring it several times while marinating, but overnite would be even better.

A very good bean salad.  Many are too strong and pickle-y, but the dressing in this one is just right!

This is an excellent bean salad!  Followed the recipe exactly except used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and omitted the onion powder.  Usually bean salad is too sweet for me but this was great and we loved the little bit of heat from the cayenne!  Only change I might make next time would be to also add some chopped green pepper for another layer of flavor.  Will definitely make again!  Update:  Made it again using about 1/3 cup diced green pepper and black beans instead of garbanzos.  WONDERFUL!

Very tasty dressing to this salad. I added cilantro, radishes, and green pepper. I also used fresh green beans instead of canned for added freshness and crunch. I made this salad for 2 separate dinner guests and both loved it.

I was looking for a bean salad and I found it!  This is great and the dressing is wonderful. However, I did add 1 large clove garlic to the dressing, skipped the garlic and onion powders as I added green and red onions to the beans. Again, the dressing is wonderful and would be great on anything!

1 stalk of celery is way too much for this recipe.  I used only 1 rib the second time I made this, which was a lot better.

I made this dish last night for lunch today...used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but did everything else exactly as the recipe said. It was easy and tastes great!  Thank you.

I was going to make 'Three Bean Salad I' but because I didn't have all the ingredients, I thought I'd make this instead. To be honest, I think I prefer the other one more - more variety of beans, plus I use fresh cilantro in it, which we really like. I did, however, like the honey and garlic in this one. Next time I will just use the things I like best from both recipes. Thanks!

I needed a recipe so I could add more beans to my diet and found this.  It became a 5 star receipe after I tweaked it.  Since I was only serving a few people, I only used 1 can of Tri-bean blend (use 2 if serving more people), 1 can of cut green beans, 1 diced red pepper, 1/2 med. sized yellow onion very thinly sliced and 1-1/2 tsp. minced fresh oregano I had on hand.  For the dressing, I only used 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, Pompeian Extra Virgin Olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, 2 tsp. country dijon mustard in place of dry, 1 tbs. of minced shallots in place of onion powder, 2 minced garlic cloves in place of powder and of course the honey (use raw honey if you want it really healthy!) - the dressing is very yummy and can use the recipe for salads, chicken or shrimp marinade, etc.  I marinated overnight and eliminated the excess dressing and wow---never thought I would like bean salad this much.

Everyone at our cookout loved this 3 bean salad. I did reduce the vinegar to 1/3 C. and added 2 cloves minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. Oh, I also replaced the green onions with red onion because that's what I had on hand. I loved the addition of the honey. Great recipe!

Really good even with having to make substitutions (I didn't have any cider vinegar, so used red wine vinegar. Also no ground mustard so a tsp of honey mustard took it's place. And navy beans subbed for garbanzo)Everything still great!!

Tastes delicious. I recommend doubling or tripling this recipe if you're feeding a family. Also, you can skip all the mixture of spices and so forth by substituting in a packet of Italian seasoning dressing (following the directions on the seasoning packet). I also substituted black beans for kidney beans and it still tasted scrumptious. This is going to be a regular recipe that I make.

FYI: If you do not know about the structures and break down of beans... beware! Flavors were good, my beans broke down before the first 24 hours. They turned into a slimy, sticky soup like thing. But I will not doc the recipe for that, it was my inexperience with beans. Will try again!

It was really good except we thought it had a little too much vinegar. Next time I'll use 1/4 cup instead of 1/2.

This is the BEST three-bean salad I have ever had!  It totally reminded me of the ones my mom used to serve when I was a kid, but the mustard gives it an extra delicious kick.  Will definitely make all summer long!  Thank you so much!

Loved this. By far the best bean salad I've ever tasted. I added a 2nd stalk of celery (small dice) and cut the vinegar and oil to about 80%. Still plenty of liquid. Delicious after just 2 hrs of marinading, but much better on day 2 after flavors melded.

I hesitated to review because I didn't have some of the ingredients but it was soooo good regardless that I couldn't help myself.  I didn't have green onions so I used a small ordinary onion finely chopped.  No cayenne pepper or celery ...we didn't miss them.  No kidney beans but I did have black beans so I put those in instead.  I also added a bit of cilantro and a garlic clove minced even though I added the powder version of garlic too.  Everyone had seconds even the picky eaters.  I'm keeping this one and using it again.  Wonderful dish.

I don't like giving a bad review, but I followed the recipe except for adding fresh garlic and white onions. I periodically tasted the mixture over 15 hours and discovered it had no taste. I went back and added the garlic powder and onion powder that I had not originally used because I was using them fresh. I then added cayenne pepper, which was an optional ingredient. I still was unhappy. Also, I did use the canned green beans as was recommended and felt the texture was off. I would recommend using frozen green beans. In any case, I won't be making this again.

I am vegan, so I did not add the honey although I suppose I could have added sugar.  I added a little extra onion because I like them and took others advice and only used 1/4 cup of vinegar.  Also, I used garlic salt.
Really good.  You probably could use any bean.

I thought this was good and "WOW" so nutritious!  I cut back on the cayenne pepper, only using a couple sprinkles.  I will try more next time.

Great recipe and it so easy to make.  Everyone loved this salad.  I know the recipe is good as is but I tweaked it by: 1) omitting green onion for 1/4 diced red onion; 2) omitting celery; 3) substituting olive oil for vegetable oil; 4) substituting minced garlic for garlic powder; 5) lessening cider vinegar to 1/4 cup; 6) adding a little more honey.

I've made this salad on a weekly basis since I found this recipe. I've made it the "original" way and this is what I've changed:
I add about 1/4 more of vinegar (I like it tangy), 
I don't like it with the celery or green onions, and I add a bit of salt.   It's absolutely delicious!!!  I love throwing a little on a green salad or eating it with a bit of blue cheese crumbled on top.  This is a keeper!!!!

Haven't tried it yet, but my question is, I'm trying to mimic a salad that had artichokes, navy beans, feta, red onion not sure what else. It was a vinegrette dressing of some sort.  Delic!     Would this work well anybody?

We found this to be incredibly bland as written with 2 hours of marination time. I had to add salt to salvage it (1/4 tsp). I think the basic idea is fantastic, cold vinegary beans, and I might try again with my favorite Italian oil & vinegar dressing. It will probably be better after sitting overnight; the leftovers are going on taco salad so it's not a loss. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavour was good but there wasn't enough juice for me. I would triple the sauce so the flavour goes thru all the beans. Not sure I'd make it again.

this was really good! i used frozen green beans (thawed them first), omitted the celery (forgot to buy it), added about 2 tsp more honey and prepared mustard instead of dry (didnt have dry). also didnt let it chill for 2 hours (no time), but it was still really good!! this will become one of our standard BBQ side dishes.
NOTE: some people complain of their being no crucnh, I always make this with fresh green beans (still no celery), problem solved :-)

I love 3 bean salad and thought they all pretty much tasted the same but this one is the best! Maybe its the honey instead of sugar? We make it all the time. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and usually omit the celery and use real garlic instead of garlic powder

How can you go wrong with 3 bean salad? It was a good somewhat healthy side dish for our BBQ. I also added white hominy corn as I like those in my salads.

I like the idea of this recipe but I realized that I don't like garbonzo beans and it was a little too vinegary. Thanks for the recipe, just not my style.

Enjoyed this salad and will make again. Really like the dressing because is not as sweet as most we have tried. Will probably use lima beans in place of the chickpeas next time. This type of recipe is quite flexible so you could use any combination of beans.

This recipe was pretty good, none of it was left after the lunch I made it for.  I used red onion instead of green and red pepper flakes instead of ground cayenne because that was what we had on hand.  I did find that the honey would not blend into the olive oil by whisking so I threw it into the blender and that helped.  Thanks for sharing.

Really great.  My first attempt at 3 bean salad.  Used agave instead of honey, dijon instead of powered, a little less oil and more onion.  Yummy!

This was pretty good, but could have used a bit more tanginess for my taste. Next time I will use the full 1/2 cup vinegar as called for in the original recipe. I had adjusted it down based on the most common complaint in the comments. The dressing was smooth and mellow. I think the honey was a great non-sweet touch. But it needed more vinegar.


Also, the green beans were a little mushy (even though I drained the salad after about 5 hours, as some commenters recommended).


And, the garbanzos were hard and bland. Next time I will use canned white beans instead. I also will change canned green beans to fresh or maybe red/pinto beans. The kidney beans were perfect and picked up the flavor nicely.


I like 3-bean salad and want a good recipe. This one has promise, I will definitely use it again with adjustments to my taste as noted.

I made a lots of adjustments. I used tri-bean can of black beans, kidney beans and pinto beans. I did not use garbanzo, onions or celery. I used distilled white vinegar and red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I doubled the black pepper, cayenne pepper and onion powder. I added a sprinkle of parsley flakes. Topped it with diced avocado and feta. I added 1T lime juice for the avocado when served. Also for good measure I used 1 can whole kernel corn.  This was great I will make it again.

Loved this- didn't even make it to the Easter dinner table as hubs couldn't leave it alone!  Only addition was some minced fresh parsley for a little taste and color.  Love the crunchiness of the celery with the creaminess of the beans.  Will be my go to 3 Bean from now on!

Absolutely loved this salad. I was tired of paying three ninety nine a pound at the deli counter, came across this one and now saving some money. I substituded vegtable oil for olive oil and added black beans making it a four bean salad.

I rated 3 stars because a made a few chages with these changes i think it is 5 stars. Omit the green onions, celery, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Add 1 small chopped onion.  Other then that make as directed. The longer it sits the better. This is always a family favorite the next day.

I loved this recipe but decided to make it out of dried beans first so that I would have an easier time controlling the salt content. Obviously that added to the time needed but the dressing was delicious  It's definitely a 'make the night before' recipe.  I used Northern white beans, black beans, and french cut green beans. Next time I am going to try grilling the scallions first to add a bit of a smokey flavor to it.

A bit too tangy so I'd reduce the vinegar next time but there will be a next time.  I also used fresh garlic and didn't add onion (we don't like them).  Left it in the fridge to marinate about three hours, stirred once and it turned out just great.

This is not one of the most flavorful bean salads I've ever eaten, but it was pretty good! I realized I was out of honey after I'd already started to make this, so I used corn syrup instead. I also used regular onion instead of green...that's all I had in the house. All in all, this is a pretty good salad, but I think I would try a different one next time.

This is so delicious!  I did cut back the vinegar to 1/4 cup after reading some reviews remarking on a strong taste of vinegar.  I also added a bit of salt and didn't try the optional seasonings.

This is very good.  I really like the dressing.  It is a very good idea to drain the beans after they have set in the fridge overnight.  It really does keep the beans from being "mushy".

Great basic recipe!  I added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 c chopped green pepper, and 1/2 c chopped celery also.  It was wonderful.

This was okay.  It was very easy to throw together.  The dressing wasn't bad; a little tangier than I'm accustomed to, but still good.

This was sooooo good!!  I didn't have honey so I used 2 packets of Equal (my dad is diabetic and I wanted him to try some).  I added fresh minced basil and gaarlic and used sweet onions because I didn't have green.  This is my new favorite recipe!!!  Everyone loved it and it was so easy!!  Thanks!

Too much vinegar for me. I tried it after a few hours in the fridge- WOW! It was better this afternoon (in the fridge about 16 hours) by far, but I will cut back next time. I did like the combination of the beans though.

This was a great recipe.  Apple cider vinegar and honey are so much better for you than distilled white vinegar and sugar.  I did not use celery but 1/2 tsp of celery seeds instead.

Great bean salad...neither too sweet nor not sweet enough.  I used dried pintos and garbanzos, along with canned green beans, and did not have to go to the grocery store because I had everything on hand.  Surprisingly, it was NOT better the second day as some things are...eat it the day you make it.

Just a comment though:  this is NOT vegan.  It has honey in it.

This bean salad was very sweet. Maybe with less honey it would be okay, but my family didn't care for it at all, so I probably won't try it again with modifications.

I thought this was great - really tasty, very simple. However, because it has honey, it's not truly vegan. I used agave nectar instead. I also subbed lemon juice for the vinegar, olive oil for the vegetable oil, used the optional onion powder, and omitted the optional cayenne pepper. This was a wonderful recipe - exactly what I was hoping for!

As written this recipes is fairly average, in my opinion.  It is missing something.  I do think it is worth trying and tweaking to your own taste, as it is a good starting point for a salad.

This was good. I think when making again though I would reduce the amount of vinegar a bit I made this first thing this morning and served this evening so it had plenty of time standing but the vinegar was very noticeable. Going to have to leave the celery out too. I keep sneaking it in and my family keep noticing. These things are just personal taste though. With adjustments will make again for sure. Thanks.

I thought this tasted good and was fast to make. It reminds me of those bean salads in the deli cases. It was a little on the tart side but filling as a side dish.

Great way to use some of the garden beans. Also added fresh minced garlic as recommended by others, and diced red onion instead of onion powder. Added chives and parsley, too. The honey is a nice addition, and don't forget to support the work of beekeepers by buying local honey!

I used fresh green and yellow beans from our garden, cooked tender/crisp, and used a somewhat larger portion of them than one can of green beans would have been.

I think this recipe can use some fresh dill weed, basil, tarragon or perhaps even thyme.

The one I have uses both green and yellow beans (canned) and that I personally dislike kidney beans so use garbanzos and black beans and it suits me better that way.  I liked the idea of adding radishes, myself--hadn't thought of them.  The beauty of recipes like this is just finding a dressing that your family likes, and changing ingredients for the salad itself to what you have on hand, what you like, etc. I would like to use fresh beans in summer but haven't managed to remember to do that yet!  Some of the canned ones are so mushy/overcooked at times.

I could not stop eating this!!  It was delicious and EASY!  I made one substitution - olive oil - not for any other reason than I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand.  Oh, I also didn't have canned green beans, so I steamed the fresh ones I had.  Making it again, right now!

I made this for a BBQ we went to, and we showed up late so I had lots of leftovers.  Because this was a nice SPICE twist these beans also made an excellent addition to steak quesadillas!

Delicious!  It was a big hit with my book club.  Since there is a lot of the dressing, I added an extra can of green beans the next time I made it.  Very good - especially after sitting in the fridge overnight.

GREAT recipe! The first time I made it I made two batches in a row because it was so good and went so fast. I added black olives, but otherwise everything was perfect.

Very good!  I used less vinegar than in the recipe, and substituted finely chopped red onion for the onion powder, and  some whole grain mustard for the mustard powder.  Since I was making it for a vegan friend, I substituted agave nectar for the honey.  Was very tasty, much better than the store bought.

This was okay, but a tad on the vinegar-y side.  Everyone at Thanksgiving ate it, but I hd way more than expected left over.  Will try another recipe.

I made this for a vegan Super Bowl party earlier this year.  I used a Vidalia onion instead of the green onions and I substituted maple syrup for the honey.  This was awesome and was one of the few dishes that was completely consumed by halftime.  I received many compliments. Am making again.

This was very good.  I typically don't care for 3-Bean salads, but this is a great mix.  I halved the vinegar and oil (I like very little dressing) and added some green bell pepper.  Thanks!

This was nice and something I don't normally include as a side. Loved the fact that honey was the sweetener instead of the usual sugar. Kids and hubby enjoyed this dish. Thanks!

I used fresh green beans from my garden, 3/4 of a can of garbanzo beans and 3/4 of a can of dark red kidney beans...I wanted the green beans to be predominate.  This was very good as I allowed it to marinate for over 24 hours before trying it.  I plan to make it again.

I actually have hated all the three bean salads that I've eaten in my life. I made this one because there was a community potluck coming up and I had tons of green beans from the garden and it was cheap lol. It was good! I didn't have garlic powder so I minced one clove of garlic  as I didn't have garlic power, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I think I would like it better with black beans, as the  kidney beans were what I didn't like in the past. But it was good with this dressing.  Poured excess out  after marinating and before serving.

No salt added in recipe. I found it sadly lacking, added close to a tsp. of salt. Did I miss it in the ingredient list? It's sitting in fridge again after adding salt. Hope it tastes better in an hour or two

This is a much better recipe than some I have seen that use almost a cup of sugar.  I use sugar sub for health reasons but 1 tablespoon of honey is perfectly acceptable to me.  Rather than using onion powder, I would rather use diced blanched or marinated fresh onion.  Onions are one of the best part of the salad for me.

This is a super tasty and easy side dish. One substitution I made was fresh green beans. I cut them up and boiled for about a minute and half then an ice bath. It gave the salad added crunch and I prefer fresh over canned. I may also try subbing out chickpeas for something else since my hubby isn't a huge fan. The dressing was his favorite part. Light and tangy. Great make ahead dish or perfect for barbeques.

Excellent easy recipe.  Add a little more honey if you like it sweeter.  I add a squeeze of 1/2 a lemon to give it a more tangy taste.

Healthy, easy side dish!  I didn't have any dry mustard so I replaced with whole seeded mustard. I also halved the olive oil to save calories and didn't miss it at all.  I found you have to let it marinate for a bit to soak up the flavor.  Will make it again!

I don't usually leave reviews, but this recipe is tasteless. You might as well just eat the veggies raw. I even let the sauce soak in overnight, and just no flavor- it doesn't taste like three bean salad. I'm looking for another recipe.

I followed the recipe and found the dressing much too vinegary; but when I reversed the ratio of oil and vinegar (1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup vinegar), it was perfect and one of the best bean salad ratios I've had.

I really like this but my family requested less vinegar.  Make it with less and it would be a five star!  I also halved the celery...

Love, love, love this! I substitute black beans in place of the green beans, and I use about 4 ribs of celery. I have not tried it with the cayenne pepper.

This is my go-to bean salad recipe.  We love it, I usually double the recipe.  the vinaigrette, especially, is spot on.  Just a note, though- this recipe as written is not vegan.  ;)  That's how I remember the recipe!!!

This was only my 2nd attempt at 3 bean salad and it turned out great!  I used fresh green beans as I have way too many beans from the garden.  I did not use celery as I did not have any and instead of green onions I used yellow sweet onion which gave it the crunch I was missing from the lack of celery. Only change I would make in the future is olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

I like a 1:1 ratio of vinegar and oil so I cut the vinegar back to 1/4 c.  Used red onion in lieu of celery. Better after it sits several hours--if  you can wait that long!

So good! Me and my fiance just started this slow-carb diet and this was perfect! I did do some substitutions. I only had on hand 400g (about 1/2 pound) of fresh green beans which I cooked before hand, and then set in the fridge immediately. I then chopped up the rest of the ingredients (only half the amounts) and added just one can of a 4 bean mix in brine that I drained. I also subbed the honey for 1/2 a packet of equal. I didn't have any issue with the 'crunch' aspect everyone seems to be lacking or talking about. I think it is because I used fresh green beans and didn't over cook them, so they retained a nice crispness to them. So fresh, delicious and flavorful, I can't wait to get into the leftovers later on.

Very flavorful.  I added a can of organic black beans, some chopped Visalia onion and a 1/4 tsp of celery seed.  Used light olive oil rather than veg. oil and  a Tbls of prepared Dijon mustard.

I think the key is making this a day or two ahead...it gets better and better as it sits! Give it a stir occasionally.  I did add an extra tablespoon of honey, otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

Great recipe! I have used butter and pinto beans soaked overnight and boiled for an hour plus a can of green beans. I have liked modifications of other reviewers and have reduced vinegar to 1/3 cup, replaced garlic and onion powders with fresh onion and garlic. I also added finely diced fennel along with the celery. Very tasty, thank you for sharing this recipe.

After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this three bean salad recipe, but it just had so little flavor. I followed it exactly, so I'm not sure why my results would be so drastically different.

I followed some suggestions to reduce the vinegar to 1/4 c. I mistakenly thought I should increase the oil a bit to make up for the reduced vinegar. There was too much dressing, in my opinion, and will use 1/4 c each next time.  Also, I used garlic cloves and red onion instead of the powder form. Great recipe!

Easy,quick,tasty 3 bean salad recipe. Great last minute addition to any meal. Almost as good as my grandmother's recipe. But that requires 24 hours to marinate. So this is a super option when I have no time.

Made this for my department potluck.  Everyone loved it.  I added more cayenne and black pepper for a kick.

I didn't have any celery, so I used red pepper instead.  Was great for colour and crunch.

Great combination of herbs and spices, and vegetables.
I used Tarragon Vinegar which added a subtle flavor that enhanced it all.  Everyone loved it.

I do not like this recipe but it may be my fault.  I did not use celery, which I do not think makes any difference and I also used olive oil.  The oil seemed to coagulate.  I don't know if other oils will do this when they get cold but I don't care for the taste.  I think I will keep looking for a good recipe.

Very good recipe. I increased the amount of honey to make it sweeter for my kid. You can add other salad-relevant vegetables.

Though the author says it was given to him by a vegan friend, it should be noted that the presence of honey makes this vegetarian but not vegan. You could sub sugar or agave to make it vegan.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  The picky kids and I could not stop eating this after we finished stirring it all together (before it has even marinated!)  Subbed lima beans for garbanzo, used fresh green beans and vidalia onion instead of green.  This is definitely a keeper, I'll be making this all summer long!

i found the flavour of the cider vinegar too strong for my liking. i would rather have a plain vinegar/sugar mix. it wasn't bad, it just wasn't the flavour i was looking for.

This is a fantastic bean salad recipe! The flavor is phenomenal and it is so easy to prepare and it's healthy to boot. The only change I made was I substituted red onions for green onions. I will be making this often. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not have green onions so I used red and I dashed on the cayenne pepper to control for my liking instead of using the recommended measurement. I like the nuttiness of the garbanzo beans and I think the salad would have been just ok without them so be sure not to skip them unless you don't like garbanzos. Thanks for a quick, simple, and tasty recipe!

Loved it! Only made one change...the onions. Instead of green onion I used white onion which added a different flavor profile and more crunch. The flavor of the dressing was great and I tossed it every half our to ensure that the salad was evenly coated. Next time, I'll make extra so there are left overs to snack on the next day.

Fantastic recipe!  I added white kidney beans because we like them and there was plenty of sauce.  Delicious blend of seasonings.

This recipe is a hit every time I make it.  The combination of sweet and vinegar is perfect, and easy to play with based on your own preferences.  I love to whip this up with green beans, chickpeas, black beans, red beans, and a can of sweet corn.

My family and I really liked this recipe. It had alot of flavor and was a nice change of pace. I added a little more of the seasonings, but no other changes.

Good, but nothing spectacular. A nice recipe to use up the rest of the garden fresh beans. I replaced the garlic and onion powder in the dressing with the the real thing.
