Followed this to a T! The wings disappeared quickly at my potluck. They might not have needed all that much rice flour and cornstarch though. Next time I might increase the masala and cumin and pretty much everything but the paprika to make it taste more curry-like since that's my preference.

Probably the best wings I've made. This is a great recipe with the right amount of crunch and spice. Not your standard sweet sticky wings these are positively addictive. Don't miss out on the sauce. It's simple to die for.

I've made this recipe a few times now. It's delicious! I always serve the wings with a side of raita. The coolness of the yogurt dish perfectly compliments the spiciness of the wings.

'Drizzle vegetable oil on top'.....I used Olive Oil and then I thought 'what other meats can I use this on other than chicken?'..... so I googled 'Chennai'...... Chef John.... nice try - you did not copy this from someone else...... this is your own creation..... and we love it! I could not find another recipe with the name 'Chennai' - although I found a city in India with the same name.... but no more. Our only change.... the first time was - 'when you don't have rice flour use second best..... semolina! - they both contribute to a crispy finish and I have used both flours - leaning toward rice flour as the best but semolina not far behind. Well done sir - our first batch was to tone down the cayenne..... you 'know' why but a great recipe. Thanks You

These turned out great! This is the second time making them. If you like Indian food you ll love these. It s hard to stop eating them. Dip these wings in the sauce. I made this with one exception. I used 2 tsp. instead of 4tsp. of cayenne pepper.
