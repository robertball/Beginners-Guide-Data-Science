Very good. I added 1/2 cup of almonds ground in a mortar and  pestle to thicken it a little more and add flavor. I read from a review of another Indian recipe that this is the traditional way to thicken in their recipes. I will definitely make this again!

We used homemade masala spices instead of masala paste.  It was tasty but a bit thin.

Excellent and easy to make!  Added one more TBSP of Masala Curry Paste to suit my taste.  Will definitely make again.

This was the first meal I made using this app. I love this app and I love this recipe. My husband doesn't like spicy so I reduced the spices and added turmeric. Turned out great. My husband loved it!

We love East Indian food.  This recipe was OKAY, but the sauce was not as rich, "red" or flavorful as chicken tikka masala served at our local East Indian Restaurants.  The sauce was thick, but I think the restaurants we frequent probably use real butter, clarified in a manner to form ghee.  Next time I make it I will use ghee instead of cooking oil, and will probably also use more spices.

We both really liked it and will have it again for sure.  I'm lazy, so I did not cut up the chicken into pieces  I cooked the 4 breasts whole.  Also, I could not find masala curry paste and had to use red curry paste instead; however, I did add garam masala spice to the dish, about 1-1-/2 tsp.  I also brined my chicken breasts before I made the dish to ensure juicy tender chicken, and it was.  I am an Indian cooking fan now.

The flavor profile is great here, I used a homemade curry paste. I also prefer using ground almonds as a thickener.
