This is my recipe. I've noticed that more often than not, you can only find crawfish tails in 12oz packages now, so I tried it with two (24oz total), and it worked out fine - and saved a bunch of money too as I found them on sale. The pic I have posted was this batch. Also note - the recipe calls for Golden Mushroom soup (not Cream of...) - the Golden has no cream in it and is very different from cream soups.

Excellent and a life saver!  As a Louisiana raised girl I was nervous about this because of the soup in place of a roux; but needed something quick and fast.  I used a frozen bag of mirepoix for the veggies and skipped the parsley since I didn't have any on hand (dried or fresh).  

Then, I had two extra for dinner show up that I wasn't prepared for.     So I added another can of the soup and thinned it out some with some heavy whipping cream so it would feed 3 normal people and 3 teenage football players after practice.  The d-linemen gave it a A+.

Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe, Staci. I have made it a few times now, over thin spaghetti. Here in New Orleans we always have left over crawfish, after a boil. I always peel and freeze them. Then I found your recipe, Yay! This recipe has worked great for a quickie meal. I have used Cream of mushroom and Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic (only because I had them in pantry) and both have been awesome. Tonight I added some Mexican Velveeta and served over Angel Hair Pasta. Itâ€™s all good, hubby loves it! Thanks again!

This is my second time eating crawfish and was very apprehensive.  The first time they tasted too 'fishy' for me so I took a friends advice and rinsed them before putting them in the skillet. Very glad that I did!  Other than the fact that it could be more spicy, it was a really good dish and something I will make again.

This is a quick an easy etouffee. I modified it by using two cans of Golden Cream of Mushroom soup and one drained can of Rotel. Enjoy over pasta or rice. It works with shrimp too.

I wanted a quick, easy recipe to use with leftovers from a crawfish boil.  This was great.  I added chopped mushrooms from the boil as well as the crawfish.  Also, I used 2 cans soup and cut down on the Tony's since the shrooms were HOT.  DELISH.  from New Orleans and got thumbs up from everyone at the table :)

Pretty good, relatively quick and easy to make. I had to use cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom since I was out of the latter. Still turned out pretty well. This is a pretty handy faster recipe than most.

I'm a Louisiana-born gal, and this is an excellent etouffee!  I let my vegetables cook on low longer than 10 min, because I like them soft.  Have made it with shrimp, as good crawfish are hard to come by here in MO!  I am making it tonight, with only one pound of shrimp, that works too.  I put on  a squeeze of lemon and some Crystal hot sauce before digging in!

This was so amazing....Quick and easy...the only change that I made was I used two cans of condensed golden mushroom soup and thinned it out with whole milk. Served over rice....I did not use frozen crawfish...I used fresh that we had left over from a crawfish boil..They tend to be more plump and fuller.

Added some water after adding the soup because the sauce was overly thick. Also added a few dashes of Tabasco for a little extra kick :) Overall, very very good and much faster/easier than making a roux!

Excellent dish. I needed to cook something fast for my in-laws lunch. This was excellent. I substituted bite size catfish.

10 stars for mushroom soup instead of a roux (which I am terrible at) 2 stars for seasoning. I am always leery of dish like this that does not call for garlic and I was not wrong. Consider this a think-outside-the-box guide but in my opinion it is not a complete recipe. I will absolutely make this again because it is brilliant but the entire thing is "season to taste."

I use Allrecipes ALL of the time and this is my first review.  I've typically made the very time-consuming etouffee but decided to give this a try on a weeknight.  It was fabulous, easy and quick.  I made some minor adjustments but it turned out great.  Used frozen chopped veggies instead of fresh, added garlic (always), extra soup and thinned with heavy whipping cream to stretch the recipe, shrimp I quick defrosted while everything else was cooking, drained ro-tel, variety of Cajun seasonings to taste and did not have parsley or green onion at the time.  This will be in our weeknight rotation, for sure!

This was my first attempt at etouffee. I had to use shrimp this time because I could not find crawfish here in OBX.  We are only here for vacation and this recipe was really easy and was a big hit my family and the family were were vacationing with.  I did add a little bit of half and half to the recipe to stretch the sauce a bit.

I live in the southwest desert so I had to substitute shrimp for the crawfish but other than that I stuck to the recipe. Easy to make and tastes delicious!
