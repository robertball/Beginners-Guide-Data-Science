Excellent soup! I didn't have any Italian diced tomatoes, so I used one small can of stewed tomatoes and one small can of plain diced tomatoes.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written. Great depth of flavor! I blended everything using my immersion blender. A great way to use up leftover chicken.  I'll be making this one again! As much of a carnivore as I am, I think I might even enjoy this more without the chicken. Delicious either way!

Very easy to make; didn't take long at all, but overall, my dad and I didn't like it. I cooked this to the tee. It just didn't taste good. It looked delicious, but it wasn't for us.

Only things I did different was ,
1) ( because I got mixed up with another recipe I was looking at) I added another larger can of whole tomatoes that I loosely chopped up...
I used my immersion blender to puree it a bit.
I then ladled it up into a bowl and threw  a handful of cheesy garlic croutons on top...was so good.
Gave my mother some, she loved it...will definately be making this again.

This is THE best soup! That’s is the second time I made it and it’s a hit. My dad and brother were impressed that I made this mostly from scratch. The only change I made was to omit the chicken, which I have on the side, and add season salt.

I had a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes, so I used that. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I used my “boat motor” (hand-held blender) to blend it smooth. It was wonderful! The best part was, it only took a few minutes to make! Next time, I’ll double the recipe.

I tried this out last night and the wife and I loved it! Surprised by one comment on here about the bisque being lumpy because they only cooked the onions 5 minutes. Contrary to that my wife asked “ what happened to the onions you were chopping to put in here ?” Being from South Louisiana, I’ll be experimenting with putting shrimp or crabmeat or crawfish instead of chicken next time!

I enjoyed this soup and really enjoyed using up leftover chicken which made it so much more interesting and meal-like than ordinary tomato soup.  Simply made some grilled cheese sandwiches to dip and go along, and it was a nice, light dinner.  Like mine spicy, so extra red pepper flakes help a lot.

The bisque was great. Not so much the chicken in it.

Excellent.  Added a can of tomato soup and half and half for more quantity. Also a bit of taco seasoning for an extra zip.

We found this to be bland.  The onions were not soft enough after 5 min, and added too much texture. Doing a lot of doctoring to it.

I used a quarter tsp less salt , added a bayleaf while it was simmering, and this was absolutely delicious with left over rotisserie chicken from last night.  It is a simple recipe that comes together quickly.  I will definitely make this again!!

Great, easy recipe! I substituted light cream for the heavy cream but still came out great.

Quick, easy, healthy and delicious. Great side as a side dish or main course. Left overs excellent to tote to work for an easy lunch.

Loved it! Used Amy's Tomato bisque since I didn't have canned tomatoes and then added real tomatoes about 6 small ones.  I left out the chicken and used fresh parsley.  We were sad we didn't make more - thanks for the recipe definitely a keeper!!
