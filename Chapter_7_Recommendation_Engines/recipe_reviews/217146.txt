Buying all the ingredients for this really gave me a well-stocked bar! The cocktail had a really complex flavor--like something you'd get at a fancy cocktail bar, but it was very simple to make once I had all the ingredients. Strong, too!

I wasn't able to follow the recipe exactly (used B&B instead of cognac and Benedictine in the suggested amounts, and couldn't locate Peychaud's bitters), but it was a tasty drink nonetheless.
