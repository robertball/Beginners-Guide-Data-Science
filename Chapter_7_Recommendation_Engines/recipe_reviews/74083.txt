I changed alot in this recipe and it turned out sooooo good. I steamed the asparagus, used spring greens salad mix, and parmesean seasoned almond slices, also I added some tomatoes, salt and pepper. OMG it was delicous. I thought only having lemon juice and olive oil as a dressing would be bland, but not at all. Thank You I will defintely be making this again :)

My daughter and I made this tonight. We added some cooked penne pasta and garlic to it and it was to die for! I am not a big fan of asparagus but my hubby is, so I gave this a shot and the flavors complimented each other so well. This is very elegant too.

I'm happy to be the first to review this recipe "Cookin' Mom"! This salad was lovely, to say the least. Simple, yet certainly elegant enough for guests. I added some garlic powder to the mix and used more parm. The warmth from the asparagus just barely wilted the spinach to perfection. Thanks so much again!

I used just a touch less oil, and added grilled chicken to make it a meal.  Toasted the almonds in a saucepan...amazing! I loved this dish:-)

Really good. I couldn't be bothered to fire up the grill just for asparagus, so I did them in a skillet on the stove. Eyeballed the Parm, and added a few cherry tomatoes that needed using up. Lovely combination of flavors. Thanks!

Very simple to prepare. I used arugula but will make it with the baby spinach next time. Nice presentation but would've liked to have had another color in the dish. Used toasted almond slices from Trader Joe's as a timesaver.

I've made this twice now, although I must admit that I didn't measure the ingredients.  This is a flexible recipe in which you can easily play around with the amounts of ingredients.  I grill about a pound of thin asparagus spears, then chop them and throw them on some spinach or a lettuce & spinach mix to make two main-course salads.  I find that it's easier to coat the asparagus with the oil & lemon juice if I put roll it around in a rectangular cake pan.  I also tried adding some powdered garlic the second time, and enjoyed the taste.  Thanks for sharing, Heather!

Quick and simple to make, but also tastes very simple. It's a good complementary side dish, but not particularly astounding.

Delicious!! Quick, easy and wonderful. I added arugula to the spinach, which added a bit more flavor. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for a great salad recipe.

This was a big hit with my husband and friends.  I broiled the asparagus since it isn't grilling weather here yet.  I also didn't follow the exact measurements.  I used one bunch of asparagus, one bag of spinach, the juice of half of lemon and I eyeballed the parmesan cheese and almonds.  I also added some salt and pepper to the salad.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad was refreshing and good for you!  I had actually started marinating the asparagus in lemon pepper and olive oil before I found this recipe so I kept it that way, grilled and mixed with the rest of the ingred. Next time i will follow exactly and i think that it will have more flavor.  Overall- good would make again.

Really liked this grilled asparagus salad! used up the baby spinach that I had and some Montrachet cheese in the fridge that I crumbled and threw on while the asparagus was still warm. OMG  It was beautiful and delicious!!

This was delicious. I followed it exactly as it says and maybe the only thing I would have done differently is add Feta Cheese instead of Parmesan. Even with the parm, it was delicious and so healthy.

This was good, almost too lemony though. I would definitely marinade the asparagus in the olive oil/lemon mixture for a few hours prior to grilling them.

Great recipe for using what you have on hand.  I replaced spinach with orzo and almonds with pine nuts because that was what I had in the house and it was great.  The lemon and oil gives a great light flavor with the asparagus.

Delicious! I love cooked veggies but have been trying to get myself to eat more healthy salads. This was quick and flavorful, the slightly wilted spinach and asparagus were really well dressed with just the oil and juice. I tossed everything but the cheese and toasted almonds (not seasoned for our tastes) and then we added them to our tastes on the plate. I will make this again for sure, thanks so much for sharing.

It's a keeper! I used rice wine vinegar since I didn't have lemon juice and pinons instead of almonds. Sauteed some chicken chunks in olive oil with salt and pepper first, then added marinated asparagus and sliced red peppers and the remaining olive oil/vinegar. Poured all that over the spinach and parmesan cheese and pinons. Toss and Yum!

I know it's boring to read the same thing over and over, but THANK YOU for this recipe.  I applied a few readers' ideas but the asparagus, the spinach, the olive oil and the lemon juice are the backbone of this dish.  I minced a fat garlic clove and added it to the olive oil/lemon juice marinade and sent a drift of very finely ground black pepper over it, too.  Sprinkle of salt.  I chopped a fresh cooked chicken breast and cooked a handful of mini penne, rinsed it and spilled it in the sink while draining it.  Saved less than half for the salad.  Rest went down the disposal.  *sniff*  Sliced a handful of grape tomatoes and yellow cherry tomatoes and tossed them in.  Another drift of fine black pepper.  Oh my!  Mouthfuls of flavoral and textural bliss!  I would have paired this with a nice pinot gris or chardonnay, but all I had was my fave shiraz.  Salad stood up amazingly well to the robust wine.  Only quibble: you say this recipe feed six; if my husband and I had had company, they'd have gone hungry.  Yes, we ate it all.  :/

This was great.  Even those people who are less than excited about vegetables ate some of this.  I roasted the asparagus in the oven with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper instead of grilling it.  I used about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  I added a dash of garlic powder to the mix.

Yum! Very quick and easy. I steamed the asparagus, cut it up, and marinated it in the dressing for a few hours; added a dash of salt to the dressing. I then mixed in the lettuce (used baby arugula) and added the cheese. Used toasted walnuts instead of almonds as one of my guests was allergic. Had some left over and it was good the next day too!

This was very yummy. I left off the parmnesan cheese and added some grilled eggplant. The dressing was surprisely tasty. I just drizzled the lemon juice ont he salad first and then only needed on teaspoon of the oil.

This was a great way to have asparagus in a different way.  It was fun and we would have it again.

This was delicious! We can't wait to make it again. I made extra for lunch and can't wait to eat it tomorrow! I made the recipe exactly as written but added a little salt to the olive oil and lemon juice mixture.

This was great!  Even my husband loved it and he has his own method of grilling asparagus.  Did not have any plain parmesan on hand but did have pre-grated 4 cheese italian blend so I threw a couple handfuls of that in.  Used honey roasted almonds.  Super!  Thanks!

I've made this several times both with grilled and sauted asparagus. Every time I have found it immensely enjoyable. It makes a very good, refreshing, citrusy salad that is perfect for summer.

I'm afraid the flavors were just too simple for me and the salad dry (too little dressing).  If I make it again, I would make a lemon vinaigrette with a little garlic, lemon zest, salt and pepper, and for some color maybe add some red or yellow peppers.

Made it with Red Leaf Lettuce and it was wonderful.  The Lemon with Olive Oil was so simple and fresh tasting.  I would think any greens will work great.  Toasted the almonds cut not sliced.  Added a bit of sweet Paprika to the almonds.

Simple but sophisticated!  Very nutritious  and great for folks doing low carb as well.  The almonds added some texture.  Quick and easy to make on a work night--love that!  For those who thought it lacked flavor, all it might need is some Kosher salt tossed in to kick up the flavors that are naturally there.  Might not be for small children however.

I used half arugula and half spinach. I added avocado and I used more slivered toasted almonds than called for in the recipe. I will definitely make it again - delicious!

I really enjoyed this  recipe! I was worried that it would be come wilted and sad the next day. I just through it in a pan and sauted it all. The spinach cooked down with the oil, parm, and seasoning making it just as good heated up.

This recipe was fantastic. I added some Vegeta to the lemon and olive oil mix which gave it an amazing tangy taste. The second time I made the salad, I also grilled some red pepper in the lemon+Olive Oil+Vegeta mix and added it in to the salad, which gave it more flavor. This is a great easy to make salad! My family LOVES IT!!
