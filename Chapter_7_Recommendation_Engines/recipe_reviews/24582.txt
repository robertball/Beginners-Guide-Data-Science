Fantastic flavor!  Just a few suggestions to make sure these are perfect everytime: 1. buy the largest mushrooms you can find, most grocery stores sell ones labeled for stuffing, they are much easier to work with 2.prior to stuffing bake the caps, upside-down, in the oven for 10-15 minutes, this help the caps shed excess water so the stuffing doesn't become waterlogged.  Thanks Dinah for such great mushrooms!

I don’t care about healthy; I added another stick of butter than the recipe called for. I also added all the liquor from both cans of clams. I bought one of those big bread crumb cans from the fryer isle pre-seasoned with Italian spices. I did dry the mushrooms a bit in the oven 10 minutes by themselves at 350 degrees. I figured with all the wet-works I added it might be wise. Man I was not prepared for how wonderful it tasted. So much flavor. I took what I could not eat, and that was plenty, to work the next day and I could not keep the cover closed. I pawned off 30 mushroom caps. They would take one mushroom and go back to their cube… wait five minutes and they would come back and take 3 or 4. Score.
The next day with the ton of stuffing left, I baked pre-spooned stuffing balls on a baking sheet for 15 minutes. Then I cored out to make caps using those small cherry tomatoes. Put the half cooked stuffing into the tomato caps. Added a little piece of mozzarella cheese on top, and then I baked them for the remaining 15 minutes. The key is not to turn the tomatoes completely into mush. 
I plan on coring squash and cucumbers boats next time. I will let you know. It should be awesome. Truth is I think I would eat this stuffing if you fed it to me stuffed in a rock. Speaking of which, make sure you thoroughly clean your mushrooms. I had one that had some grit. It is easy to miss with all the hiding places for dirt in a mushroom. That would be embarrassing at work or a party.: )

These were the MOST delicious stuffed mushrooms I've ever had.  I made a quadruple batch for my holiday party, and they were gone in the first 15 minutes!  People are still complimenting me on these mushrooms.  They were so easy to make, and the stuffing would be great with other vegetables, too, like tomatoes or peppers or even to stuff a chicken breast for seafood.  I made the stuffing a day a head and refrigerated it overnight, which really gave the flavors a chance to mix.  But if you do this, since the butter hardens the mixture, you'll need to set it out for about 30 minutes or so before you stuff the mushrooms or microwave it for a few minutes on no more than 30% power.  AWESOME recipe!!

Delicious 5+++ stars with the following changes per other reviews.  Cut butter by 1/2 and used 1 can of clam juice in mixture. Cook caps upside down for 10-15 mins. to eliminate excess moisture.  Sautee onion and garlic. I used 3 packs of reg. white mushrooms, but could have easily used 4 packs for the amount of mixture in this recipe.  Received rave reviews.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!  Try this one (w/ changes) and no one will be disappointed.

I had never made or had stuffed mushrooms in my life until now.  GREAT RECIPE!!  I catered a wedding and was complimented all night.  People even asked for the recipe.  I followed another review and added Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and cut the Italian seasoning in half.  Perfect!  I also made the mixture the night before, which made the seasoning blend perfectly.  It was a bit time consuming, but a food processor would cut the prep time in half.  (For those of you hunting...I found cans of chopped clams with the tuna fish cans in the grocery store.)  Enjoy!

This was an absolute hit on Christmas Eve.  Everyone loved.  My brother couldn't stop eating them!  I changed up just a bit from other's suggestions.  Here is what I did different:  1.  Substituted green onions for green peppers  2.  Multiply the amount of mushrooms in the recipe by 1.5-you will have enough stuffing for that many mushrooms 3.  Take the butter way down-use 1/3 of the amount called for, and use it in the stuffing-don't drizzle any on top at the end 4.  I used all clams 5.  Added juice from one can of clams
The end effect was incredible!

Excellent! On the advice of others I used 3/4 cup of butter for the stuffing mixture, but I drizzled olive oil on them instead of another 3/4 cup of the butter. It was one of the appetizers at thanksgiving dinner and I was proud at how they came out-thanks so much!

Very easy and quick! My family enjoyed it. I agree with some of the other reviews, easy on the butter - I only used 1/2 cup (1/4 cup for the clam stuffing and 1/4 cup for drizzling). I added a 1/4 cup of clam juice into the stuffing mix in place of the butter and it worked out fine.

This was a good recipe. Way too much butter. I cut down to 1/2 cup and drizzled a small amount over mushrooms before baking and they were still oily. I would recommend less than 1/2 cup. Very good flavor, however. I may try again with less butter.

Everyone liked these although I think the general consensus was that everyone enjoyed the ones I made last year with spinach better.  These were good, just not our favorite.

These were the best tasting mushrooms we've ever had!!! Think I need to get the big mushrooms next time cause there was a lot of leftover stuffing (wish I had more mushrooms) :) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

I wanted to make something different this year for Christmas dinner and thought I'd give stuffed mushrooms a whirl. I read through lots of recipes and reviews and liked this one best. I altered it a bit for fussy eaters who don't like anything crunchy. I sautéed finely chopped mushroom stems, onion, garlic and pepper in the liquid from the clams and 2 T melted butter until softened. Then I combined the sauté with everything else in Step 3 and followed the recipe as stated from there. I reduced the overall butter amount by half. Fantastic flavor, I've been craving them ever since!

I had high hopes for this, but it did not meet my expectations.  I let it sit in the fridge for 24 hrs so the tastes would meld, but it didn't help. I only used about 1/3 the butter and I still thought my arteries were going to burst.  I used the juice from the clams like suggested.  However, the taste of the Italian Seasoning is WAAAAAY overwhelming.  You could easily use half.  Lemon Juice squeezed on top does help a bit, but man, cut down on the Italian Seasoning!  I would not make this again without some adjustments.

OMG These were so good. They were fairly easy to make. Delicious. The whole family loved it, we had it as a side dish for dinner. And YES it is comparable to the one at that famous Italian restaurant! I will never buy stuffed mushrooms from there ever again! :) Just a note: The mixture makes DOUBLE the amount that you need. I would suggest either cutting it in half OR doubling the amount of the mushrooms. Great.

These were very good and i received compliments from our guests. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cutting back on the butter as others did. I only used one stick of melted butter in the mixture. No need to pour butter over the shrooms when baking. Did not see neeed for pre-baking the mushroom caps prior to filling. I had enough filling for approx 50 small mushroom caps, so you could cut the filling in half or but more mushrooms. Based on this info, there is NO WAY these puppies are 300+ calories each. Will make again and put into cocktail party apps rotation.

Very yummy, but I made changes.  First, I havled the recipe, due to other reviews.  I added the minced stems into th stuffing mix.  I omitted the butter and green pepper.  I also pre-baked the caps to rid them of excess moisture.  I added the juice of the one can of clams, and decreased the amount of bread crumbs til the texture was just crumbly, but wet enough to roll "balls" to stuff the caps.  Next time I would sprinkle mozzerella over top, and add a drizzle of butter or butter spray before baking.  Family still tore them up (no leftovers) and a family friend came over, had one, and asked for the recipe.  A keeper! Thanks!

This recipe tasted great!  My wonderful girlfriend changed a few things around, at the recommendation of other reviewers, to cut out a lot of the butter.  Instead of using Italian seasoning, she used Italian bread crumbs.  It worked great.  Another good tip from another reviewer is to bake the caps for 15 minutes before adding the stuffing to let out some of the water in the mushrooms.  We had them on big Portabella mushrooms, so preparing extra stuffing for those big caps is a must.  I think the mushrooms would be even better with lump crab meat instead of clams as well.  Going to try it next!  Great recipe!

This recipe makes great stuffed mushrooms, but it also makes great stuffed CLAMS!  Here in Rhode Island, we have an abundance of Quahogs, which I chop to use in this recipe for both mushrooms and stuffies.

I use both freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses in the mix.  Adding an egg helps bind the mix together a bit more, and also allows you to cut the butter back to 1 cup.

Your guests will love this one!

Just made these this evening and took to a party. Everyone liked them. There was a professional chef there and I asked him his opinion. He thought they were tasty but a little too much bread. I personally think the recipe calls for far too much butter. I think one cup would be quite sufficient. Also, I had WAY much stuffing mix left over after I generously stuffed 20 large mushrooms. Next time, I'll buy 30 mushrooms. I may cut back on the breadcrumbs by a 1/4 cup. This is a crowd pleaser.  I plan to make them for a New Year's party. Thank you Debnjames.  : )

Fantastic recipe! I've made this numerous times, and they keep getting requested for potlucks!  Here a few things I change around according to preference and playing with the recipe:   (1) I don't use green peppers. Sometimes I cut up the mushroom stems and add those in though.  (2) Buy extra mushrooms! I usually can go through about 3 small packs. Both white button and portobello are delicious.  (3) Cut down on the butter! I only use the butter as a drizzle (and even then, you don't need much) right before I pop them in the oven. For the mix itself, I use the juice from one can of clams. If you want to use both, add more bread crumbs.  (4) Drying the shrooms is easy if you feel they are too wet. Put them cap up on a cookie tray and heat them in the oven for 10-15 minutes.   (5) If you are left with extra stuffing and no mushrooms, you can cook it in the corner of a small baking pan. It make a great dip!

WOW!  These were great!  I took them to a party and everyone wants the recipe.  The only thing I changed was divided the butter in half and I didn't use clams, I used crab meat.  EXCELLENT!!

I have made these for my last few parties and they are always a hit.  I did cut down on the butter though by about a third and they are still decadent.

I have made this recipe more times then I can count! I love it! Even someone who doesn't like mushrooms loved it. After making it the first time I did revise it a bit. I usually double it because they go so fast. 1)I use an extra can of clams just because I like them. 2)I only use half a regular size onion because what qualifies as small anyways?? 3)I never use the bell peppers because this dish is so good it doesn't need color! 4)I don't like the random crunch of spice for the dried parsley and Italian-style seasoning so I put them in a mortar and crush then up into a fine powder with the pestle so you get the flavor without the crunch!! 5)I usually put on the butter before the mozzarella cheese because it helps it stick better and I don't measure my cheese, I just use as much that covers them.

When it all comes down to it I only make small revisions so Thank you to who ever first made this!! You are amazing!

These were awesome! Made these Christmas eve as an appetizer with half the amount of butter as other reviewers suggested. Made half batch since just me & the hubby, so had a few leftover & they were still great, rewarmed.

My roommate said these were too salty--I guess it was from the clams, but I don't agree with him at all. I thought they were really good. I didn't much care for the chewiness of the clams, but it wasn't unappetizing, just a "eh... that's not my fave" sort of thing. Prep took a while, but it was worth it.  The only changes I made were to cut the butter in half and only add it to the stuffing (none over it all before baking), per some other reviews. I left them in about an extra 5 minutes, just because I wanted the cheese browned a bit more. For the most part, they were delicious.

These are the best stuffed mushrooms in the world! My husband refuses to eat "sand" caps anymore, if they are not stuffed with these ingrediants. Follow the recipe precisley. Never wash mushrooms, take a very light damp cloth and dab them down. Adding a little of the juice from the canned clams if you find you added a too much breadcrumbs and don't want to add anymore butter than the recipe requires. I have made this over a dozen times, and each time it has come out to perfection. Thank's Dinah for making this and sharing with all of us!

Delicious! I used a portabella for the base and it was a tad tough so I think next time I will go through the trouble of cleaning/de-stemming the smaller specimens. I also used italian breadcrumbs and only used the butter in the stuffing, omitting the butter to be drizzled. Very tasty and I don't miss the extra butter one bit!

I HATE mushrooms but the stuffing was out of this world. Every one loved these, they were the first thing to go at the football/Nascar party today. I did eat one (though I discarded the mushroom) I immediately started to think of other this I can use this stuffing in. My husband suggested using it to make stuffed Haddock, I cant wait to try it out!

THANK YOU for this wonderful recipe. You know sometimes you try a recipe hoping for what is promised (that it tastes like Olive Gardens) and it does not, This recipe DOES. I read the reviews and was scared to use the amount of butter, however would not have liked it without the amount specified, that is the way the resturant does it. I also added a little extra parm. cheese and garlic, dont think can ever have too much. My family loved your recipe, it sure beats going to the resturant and two adults and three kids fighting over them. Now I can make enough for the entire family to enjoy. 

Thank you so much Dinah

It was good... not great but good. I used Italian seasonsed breadcrumbs, which worked out fine. I found that there was way too much stuffing for the amount of mushrooms, and also that there was too much butter for my liking. The green peppers were also a bit overwhelming.. they took away from the overall taste. Next time I will omit them, as I see many others did. Despite my harsh critique, it was not a bad tasting dish. I will probably make them again, with modifications.. :)

The batter was too dry, Very tasty and non the less very delicious, very very dry, hard to stuff when your filling is falling everywhere instead of the mushroom and I did half the recipe.

This is a great recipe!  If you like Olive Garden's stuffed mushrooms- you will like this.   I only used 1 can of clams and omitted the green pepper.  I would cut down on the butter, as others suggested- it doesnt need that much.  One reviewer suggested crab meat- I may try that next time.  Sounds good!  These are wonderful!

Great recipe! These are tasty! Super rich. You eat one, and then you want to eat another, and then you think, 'oh, it's just mushrooms, and they're so yummy, i can eat 6 of them' - and then you're like 'oh my gosh, i just ate 6 of these and i'm going to die.' But at least you die happy.

I made these as appetizers for my very Italian family, and they LOVED them... so much that I only got to have one in the end because they scoffed them down so quickly. My husband and I ended up making an entire batch for ourselves! Anyway, having a housewarming party at our new house tomorrow, and making them for a 3rd time.

I made this for a christmas gathering recently and after reading many reviews I cut the butter in half. It was a huge hit and I took home an empty dish. I made it again this past weekend but this time I kept the butter the same as the recipe called for. I think it was better and made the mixture a little more moist like restaraunts serve them. And yes I still got rave reviews.

This recipe was so easy. I thought it sounded interesting, so I threw it together and took it to my parent's for Christmas hors d'oeourves. My brother (a huge critic) said there was no way I could have made these because they were too good! The stuffing made more than I could fill the mushrooms with. I'd like to try filling tomatoes with the leftovers next time. Thank you for the terrific and easy recipe!

These were delicious! I used bacon instead of clams and red and yellow peppers since that's what I had. I read in some reviews they said to pop the mushrooms in the oven to get extra water out, I however don't think this is necessary because it actually gives the stuffing some extra mushroom flavor! BUT it is a good idea to wait until the end to put the cheese on top otherwise it will look burned.

This stuffed a 1 pound package of medium sized button mushrooms...heaped as they should be!  I always used to precook my mushrooms, but I followed this recipe exactly and didn't precook this time. I must say I liked them this way better! They still had some body to them...weren't mushy or slimy.  My husband actually liked them for that reason...he doesn't normally eat mushrooms because of the slimy texture when cooked. I also liked that the bell pepper still had a little crunch left and the mushrooms didn't fall apart in the oven!

Changed recipe only slightly...used jumbo lump crab instead of clams, both red and green bell pepper, no garlic. These were fantastic! Rave reviews from guests at a Christmas Eve party!

This recipe is delicious. My mother (may add is the biggest critic in the world) loved them. She was mad I didn't make more. The only thing I did different was cut down on the butter. But other then that, if you follow this exactly you can't go wrong. thanks for the recipe!

These were terrible! I followed the directions step by step. My husband and I couldn't even eat them. We ended up scraping the stuffing out and just eating the plain mushrooms.

These were just OK.  I took the recommendation of others which is to prebake unstuffed mushrooms to help expel the water but they still came out sort of soft.  I also cut down on butter in stuffing and didn't drizzle butter on top. Glad I didn't because this would have made them more soggy.  Don't get me wrong, Family liked them, no complaints but didn't like so much that they only chose these over the other appetizers.  I think these need to be tweaked.

Absolutely fabulous, easy to make and my family loved them. I had maybe 1/2 cup butter remaining as I carefully drizzled them with it. I will reduce the butter next time by half as it is not needed. These were amazing, thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious recipe, the only thing I would do differently would be to add less butter.  Next time I will cut it down to 3/4 cup butter.

On the perfect advice of another I used 1/4 c. butter and added 1/4 c. juice from a can of clams. I used 2 big boxes of shrooms and still needed another box. If I make these again, I'll only use 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (if any) and add more cheese. With this recipe you are eating italian breadcrumbs with a little clam. I'm happy I made it because now I'm more confident in making stuffed things.

This recipes has become a family favorite!  I have recently made some modifications in order to reduce the fat content and was able to do this without losing the flavor.  I saute the vegies with cooking spray and add 1 tbs. wine.  Once the liquid reduces, I add the remaining ingrediants (except for butter).  I add one of the clams with juice and the other drained.  Once the mushrooms are stuffed, I take 1 tablespoon melted magarine and mixed it with some of the clam juice from the second can of clams.  I drizzle the mixture of the stuffed clams, top with cheese and bake as usual.  No one noticed the difference! YUM!!!

Really wonderful.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used the clam juice.  I used olive oil to dampen instead of butter (I didnt have enough butter) until I got a moist enough consistency.  I really liked the subtle taste of the green peppers.

I have been looking for the perfect stuffed mushroom recipe and this is IT!!! I have tried several other recipes but I did not like any of them. I reduced butter to 1/2 cup and I added half of the liquid from the clam. I used Italian breadcrumbs and reduced Italian seasoning to 1 tablespoon. I increased green bell pepper to 1 cup and I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I had some stuffing left over, so I made stuffed jalapenos too. Since my boyfriend likes spicy food, I added some jalapeno seeds (about 2 teaspoons). They were SO GOOD!!! Thank you so much, Dinah!!!

I have been making this recipie for over a year. I always bring these to parties and my dish is always the only one that's been cleaned out. I like to grate my own mozarella cheese very finely. I cook the mushrooms for 20 minutes, then cover each mushroom with a pile of the grated cheese and broil for a couple minutes to melt and brown the tops.

These were fantastic and smelled great while baking!!! (I did leave out the green pepper and sauteed the mushrooms for a couple of minutes in the butter before stuffing - just my preference) This does make a lot of stuffing for the amount of mushrooms, but just put the leftover amount in the fridge and make more later. They are so good you'll want more anyway. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

I used 12 baby portabellos halved the amount of butter, but they came out scrumptuous, anyways.  My husband loved them, though I "forgot" to tell him they were full of clams and parsley: two things he says he doesn't like!

Absolutely delicious!!! I made these for Christmas as an appetizer and everyone loved it. I would suggest getting more mushrooms though otherwise there will be a lot of stuffing mixture left over. Otherwise absolutely yummy, thanks for the great recipe!!

Very tasty.  I followed other's advice and reduced the butter dramatically, which was a great idea.  I ended up using one stick of butter and the juice from one can of clams.  I just mixed all of that in with the filling and didn't drizzle anything over the top.  I also took other's advice and used one can of clam and one can of crab.  I wish I'd just used two cans of clam as the recipe suggested.  Crab just has such a mild flavor and I don't think it added as much as more clams would have.  Next time I'll probaby also add the chopped mushroom stems.  Overall very delicious with rave reviews from my friends.  I did have TONS of extra filling, but I just used it to stuff a pepper the next day!

It ended up being YUMMY, but with a few alterations.  I actually hadn't read the other reviews before making the recipe, but as I was preparing it based on the directions, I had to double check twice to see if the amount of butter was right -- I thought maybe it meant tablespoons, not cups!  I adjusted and used a bit less than half of what was stated, just until the crumbs were saturated, and using LIGHT (1/3 less fat) butter, but still probably could have used less to make it less salty and greasy.  We're also not big clam fans, so I used fresh diced baby shrimp instead.  Still, YUMMY as all heck, and no ingredient dominated the flavor.  With some minor changes, thanks to this recipe I will never order stuffed shrooms in a restaurant again -- they're better at home!  Thanks Dinah!

I like several other reviewers reduced
my butter by half.  I kept the clam juice and poured it in to my melted butter.  I also added red and yellow
bellpepper and cayenne pepper for a 
little extra punch.  Compliments all
around everyone loved them and I had no leftovers.  I could have made more
and they too would have been consumed.
Then again I did have 40 guests.  Thanx fo a great easy to follow, quick
yummy recipe.  I will use it again!

These are AWESOME!!  I served these for our New Year's Eve party and they were a HUGE hit!  Like the other reviewers have said, this recipe makes way more filling than for 20 mushrooms.  I bought 40 good-sized mushrooms and could have filled a few more!  I also cut out 2 to 3 tablespoons of butter after reading the other reviews.  They were superb!!  Thanks for a winner!!

These are amaaaazing!!  My boyfriend claims they're the best he's ever had...ever!  That said, I did modify the recipe just a tad.  I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs and only half of the butter, using reserved clam juice for the rest of the moisture needed.  Maybe the mushrooms in Arizona are smaller than most, but I've always been able to get double the amount of (overflowing!!) mushrooms than the recipe states.  Oh...just a word of caution.  The first time I made these, I used crab instead of clam (I was scared...) and was not really that impressed.  Only once I switched back to clam, did I realize these are out of this world!!  Try these...you WILL LOVE THEM!  These always impress the heck out of people when I show up with them  :-)

Excellent - best stuffed mushroom recipe I have ever used. I put more cheese in then called for, because I love cheese. And I followed others' suggestions about the amount of butter, and they turned out delicious.

I made these for a small party and they were gone so fast! I made just a few changes as suggested by other reviewers: used 1 can of clams and 1 can of crab and used only about 1/2 c butter. Also, I chopped up some of the mushroom stems and added them to the stuffing, and I substituted Asiago cheese for the mozz. This did make quite a bit of stuffing; I used about 20 pretty large mushrooms but could have stuffed about 35. I think I'll trying using the rest to stuff chicken breasts.

This recipie was delicious.  I found that drizzling mushrooms with the remaining butter, knocked the mozzarella cheese off, so that's about the only thing I would change.  Drizzle first, cheese second.     Going to make this one again for sure!!

I liked the flavor of this recipe and will probably make it again, but I think 1 1/2 cups of butter is way too much.  I had to remove the mushrooms from the pan immediately because they were swimming in butter.  Other than that, they were very good.

Hail Dinah!!!! I loved this recipe, the flavor was just what I hoped it would be and although the prep time took me a little longer due to lack of stuffed mushroom experience it was well worth it. As for the butter, it was a common sense thing, when I felt it was enough I stopped adding it. My hubby and I had them for dinner with a salad! More than just an appetizer. Thanks Dinah

These mushrooms are INCREDIBLE!!  My whole family loves them.  I made them according to recipe first and they were great, then the second time I made them with margarine (and only 1 c instead of 1 1/2) and they were still GREAT!  I highly recommend this recipe!

These were really good and I will try again but I will cut the butter in half.  I am not a person to watch my fat grams at all - but this was just far to much butter and I am not even really sure why.  Any way -  I will try again - As for kids liking it - None of the kids that are around my house will let a mushroom even touch their plate to begin with so I really wasnt a fair judge on that one.  rray

I absolutely love this recipe!  I made them for a get together and everyone raved on and on about them.  They are the best mushrooms I've ever had!  I would recommend to buy a few extra mushrooms because there was some stuffing left over even after I generously stuffed them.  It takes a little bit of time to prepare, but it is very easy!

These are delicious. The only thing I do differently is , before stuffing, dip the mushrooms in melted butter. The texture after baking is so much better than dried out.

Cannot say enough about these AMAZING stuffed mushrooms. I have only ever done stuffed mushrooms once before that had more of a cheese based stuffing and although good, it was simply too much cheese. When I stumbled upon this recipe, I thought the clams were different but something I was still eager to try. Boy am I glad that I did. I kept the recipe exactly as written other than capping the mushrooms with more cheese and I used a little less butter. I took another users advice and put the mushrooms in the oven for 10 minutes before stuffing so that they would release some of the water beforehand and it turned out to be a great idea. Once stuffed and baked, these were heavenly. Very easy to make and most of these ingredients are already on hand. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Healthy version alert!  I followed most of the recipe, but I only used half the onion and mixed in about a cup of kale that I processed in the food processor.  I also added 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper seasoning, but it could have used more.  I only used two tablespoons of butter, and instead used about a half cup of whisked egg whites.  I had a lot of left over filling so I greased a glass pie plate and cooked it beside the mushrooms...it was a hit with the whole family.  My only criticism is that I got large mushrooms and the flavor of the mushroom overwhelmed the filling so overstuff those mushrooms!!  I think using cooked ground sausage instead of clams would be amazing!

Great recipe...modified a little, added ground sausage meat and lemon pepper. Precooked the stuffing the night before, refrigerated over night to let all the flavors blend. Otherwise followed the recipe.... they where a HIT... Thank You... :-)

These were really good, but even better the next day. I would recommend letting the mixture sit over night for the stronger flavor.

Whenever my husband and I go out to eat I love ordering stuffed mushrooms.  Always been afraid to make it but took a chance with this recipe and im glad I did. I took a suggestion made by a reviewer to bake srooms for 10 mins befire stuffing to remove moisture.  I LOVE this recipe.  found a new item to add to my menu at home. Thx for sharing.

These were great!  Made these for Christmas Eve with a crab dinner and everyone loved them. I used less butter also and baked ahead.  I used green onion in place of green pepper- Can't really taste the clams either but it made it have a rich taste.

5th time in 8 months making these mushrooms. I always ask "what can I bring?" and the last 4 times......your stuffed mushrooms. Of course they are not 'my' stuffed mushrooms and I always make copies for whomever asks giving the writer of this recipe full credit. They rock!

Everyone LOVED these mushrooms.  I only used about 3 Tbsp of melted butter, and instead used the juice from one of the cans of clams, and they were plenty moist.  Definitely will use more mushrooms next time, this makes a lot of stuffing!

Based on other recommendations, I used less than 1/2 the butter called for. I made one batch and we thought they were okay. I added cream cheese to the leftover stuffing, added the stems and baked.....omg, so GOOD!

Gave this a 3 star because the onions and green bell peppers overpowered the taste for me. 
I made this a second time without the green bells (i think a sweeter one would be better if used at all) and scaled back on the onion. 
I used Itailian style crumbs and omited the parsley and itailian style seasoning as the Itailiian bread crumbs had those ingredients in them already. After the modifications they were very good. TY for the recipe!

I am just an "average cook" when the mushrooms came out of the oven- and I tasted one I said to myself    "Did I really make these ?"   They were BETTER than I've had in many restaurants - just so delicious. Thanks for this recipe-I can't wait to make again and bring to a party as an appetizer I know my friends/family will FLIP OUT over this recipe. Another keeper for sure !   ps.  I used one cup of butter -& still thought it was plenty.

Very good recipe.  I took it to a progressive dinner and received many compliments.  My changes: I used 4, 8 oz. pkgs. baby bellas (~30 ct), baked caps for 10 min. prior to stuffing, replaced 1/2 the gr. pepper with red bell pepper, used 2/3 stick unsalted butter in stuffing and about 1/4 c. of clam juice (reserved from can),  and reduced drizzled butter to 1/4 c.  I would use salted butter next time or add a touch more salt to the stuffing.

These were absolutely delicious. I do not think I followed the recipe exactly, I just added all the ingredients by eye but it was really good.

Awesome flavour, but geeze, WAAAY too much on the butter, Deb.   Do you have your catfish St. James or the garlic/romano pasta posted anywhere?   Angelina would love those.

These are one of my favorite appetizers!  Not too difficult to make, and so worth it when you pop the first one in your mouth.  Try them with crab...you won't be sorry.

This was very good and easy to fix. I took the advice of others and precooked my mushrooms in the oven for a few minutes while I put the stuffing together. I also chopped and added the stems to the stuffing. We don't use butter so I substituted Simply Best and worked out beautifully. We didn't use as much "butter" as the recipe called for as we felt that was too much for us. I also used red peppers in place of green. I don't happen to care for the green ones much. I also liked it with crab meat it gave it a nice flavor as well. Thank you

I doubled recipe and made these for Christmas Eve dinner.  My family went crazy over them.  I left out the green pepper as somehow the pepper I bought at store didn't get home with me.  Great with or without.  Family says 5 STARS PLUS.

This is the first thing I have cooked in a long time.  They were very easy to make and super fast as well.  I prepped my ingredients the day before and was able to cook like on TV.  It took me about 10 minutes to make and 20 to cook.  Everyone loved them.  Next time I think I will use less butter and more parmesan cheese.  Thank you so much for this recipe it was fun to make

About a close as you can get to Olive Garden Stuffed Mushrooms. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of putting in the parsley and italian seasoning and they were sooo good.

This was my first attempt at stuffed mushrooms and they were good. I used some of the clam juice instead of the full amount of butter and the were perfect. One of my guests was a professional chef and even he was impressed!

I agree wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that stated, "these are just like the ones in the fancy Italian restaurant..." Made them for our family Christmas Eve party and the everyone loved em. I tried crabmeat in place of the clams and they were yummy too. Bet you could use shrimp as well. Will definately fix these again for New Years Eve! Nice job Dinah!!

The clams really do add a new dimension to stuffed mushrooms. I was worried it might be overpowering in clam flavor, but it wasn't. I found myself even sneaking bites of the stuffing since it was so yummy! Next time I might chop up waterchestnuts in the stuffing mixture because I'm partial to a little crunch in my stuffed mushrooms.

Wonderful! I made these for Christmas Eve. to bring with me to a family dinner.. I adjusted the recipe somewhat though; Needed to double the recipe.. I did not double the butter... kept it down to 2 cups (butter is nescessary hw) I sauteed the garlic greenpepper and onions in a little butter and white wine.. used the juice of one of the clam cans.. I also baked the mushrooms stuffing side down for 10 minutes.. I found this not only releases excess water (as other reviews stated) but also helps the overall cooking process.. they were perfectly tender in 25 minutes..everyone loved them.. and everyone was surprised I used clam meat in the stuffing... they were wonderful and I was asked for the recipe by several relatives..my sister inlaw wants to serve them at her christmas party... Thanks Dinah!!!

I'm not sure if your supposed to scrape out the insides of the mushrooms before you stuff them, but it gives alot more room for the filling. The mushrooms were very good, but not the best i've had.

This recipe is wonderful! Every time I have made these mushrooms, I get rave reviews. I've had enough requests for this recipe that I carry it with me when I serve them. They've come out perfect every time and the recipe can be altered to taste, such as omitting the green peppers if you are serving them to someone who doesn't like peppers. I do recommend adding a smidge of salt, however. One of my most-used recipes!

These mushrooms were absolutely delicious. I usually stuff mushrooms with an italian sausage stuffing but wanted something different for a change. I only used about 1/2 of the butter and I sauted the onion, garlic, and green pepper before adding it to the stuffing mixture. I think this recipe would also be great with crab meat. Thanks for sharing it!

I made two batches of stuffing, one crab meat and one minced clams.  I used almost all of the juice and thought it tasted a tiny bit too salty.  I added more bread crumbs to the mixture, used green onion and red bell pepper.  I loved them and so did my guests.  Thank you.  I will definitely make these again.

Made these for a baby shower, the mommy-to-be loves mushrooms. She loved them, my sil thought they were tastey too. i used some baby portebellas and some small white caps. Be sure to watch them closely when cooking, the small caps cook much faster than meatier caps.

These were AMAZING!!  I used 30 mushroom caps and used 2 cans of clams and 1 can of crab meat.  I used a red bell pepper instead of green.  Also, one thing I changed that (I think) made them even better was:

I used fresh dill and fresh parsley.  The dill was my own addition.  These were flavorful, fairly easy to make and everyone was reaching for seconds and thirds!  

I would put them under the broiler for a few min just to brown the tops.  Planning to make these again VERY soon!  Oh, and don't use all that butter!  You can get away with 1/2 a cup IN the mixture and just cooking spray before going in the oven.

Fantastic!  These came out absolutely gourmet, and were gone in less than 10 minutes!  Everyone loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the green pepper (personal preference).  I also used seasoned breadcrumbs, so I halved the Parsley and Italian Seasoning.  Oh, and the stuffing definitely fills more than 20 mushrooms.  Thanks so much Dinah!

Great recipe! The beauty is you can add or remove a few ingredients and it still tastes wonderful! I (as I always do) changed a few things. I used 12 medium potabellas, omitted the green pepper, added baby salad shrimp, used fresh parsley, more garlic and used a combo of colby, monterey jack and mozzerella. I used a ton of cheese and just threw it over the whole thing in a large baking dish (We are cheese freaks in my family). I just threw the extra suffing around the mushrooms (I used this dish as a side).  I could make a meal of just the mushrooms and a salad. Thanks so much for the recipe I have looked for years to find.

I made this recipe for a Superbowl party. I also made a vegetarian version using chopped mushroom stems in place of the clams. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, so I cut back on the dry seasonings. I also added a splash of lemon juice to the stuffing mixture. All that being said everyone really liked them. Even had a picky eater go back for seconds. Very good. Would definitely make again.

As the recipe is written I wouldn't rate this  highly. There is far to much seasonings. I halved the seasonings the second time and they turned out much better.

These were fabulous! I made very few changes...I just subbed a can of crab meat for one can of clams & as other viewers suggested, I cut down on the butter used in the stuffing & moistened it w/ some of the clam juice. I did use almost twice the amount of mushrooms but they all got ate.

Out of the 20 appetizer recipes I have ever tried, this recipe was the best. Lots of compliments and even though the ingredient list seems long, it's a very quick appetizer to make. This is definetly a staple of mine for entertaining from now on. (Oh I used margarine instead of butter and reduced fat mozzarella, no need for extra sat fats).

This recipe was mouthwatering!  I used Baby Portabellos instead of regular 'shrooms, and I also used a fresh, 4-cheese blend (parmesan, romano, asiago, provolone) instead of the parmesan and they were to die for!  The only other thing I would say is there was too much butter - I cut down on it the second time I made these.  Everyone loved them!

Way too much butter for me.  I made again using approximately 1/2 cup of chicken broth mixed with 1/4 cup of butter to moisten the bread mixture and did not drizzle with additional butter.  I thought it was much better the second time.  Not the best I have ever had.

Thank you Dinah for this wonderful recipe.  My only changes were that I used only one cup of butter and less green pepper (my own personal taste).  My guests gobbled these up in no time!

I made these for my husband one evening and he thought that these were the best stuffed mushrooms he had ever eaten.  These are truly great, and so easy prepare!  These are not very greasy, and have å wonderful flavor.  I am going to try real crab the next time I make them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love these little appetizers.  As a matter of fact, they are usually my main course.  My husband is not fond of clams, but he really likes these.  My next get together, I will be serving them.
Thank you for submitting the recipe!

EXCELLENT!  This is the stuffed mushroom recipe I have been searching for.  I added a can of crab meat in addition to the clams and the mushrooms still came out great.  I also added some mozzarella cheese to the mixture  The only thing I didn't add was the parmesan cheese because I forgot to pick up a can in the grocery store, and I think that is something you should NOT leave out.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing it!!!

Overall, pretty good.  Tastes alot like "that Italian resturants" stuffed mushrooms which i love.  I cut calories by using fat free cheeses and margerine instead of butter.  i also reduced the amount of margerine to 3/4 cup as opposed to 1 1/2 cup.  seems a little strong on spices but perhaps i did not mince the garlic well enough.  

very good recipe! thanks Dinah

Absolutely delicious!  I only had 6 large fairly large portobello caps, so I halved the stuffing.  Next time I think I would decrease the green pepper a bit, and double the clams.  SO GOOD!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I made 30 mushrooms and they all went in 5 minuets. Everyone kept telling me how delicious they were. I will definitely be using this recipe a lot.

I liked it with a third less Italian seasoning, one cup butter with 1/4 cup reserved for top, a little clam juce from the can, fresh parsley or a little less dried, could be good with Italian sausage, too

Yes! If you're thinking of making these stop thinking and do it. A few tips from my experience: 

I used 1/2 c butter, 1/4 olive oil, and the juice from 1 can of clams (still seems like a lot of butter). By the time my mixture was moist, I used about 3/4ths of the liquid (didn't drizzle before going into the oven). 

We are big garlic lovers so I doubled the amount which was perfect for our taste. 

I used cremini  ("normal") mushrooms, which created a perfect bite-sized morsel, but be prepared if you do that, you'll need more like 50 mushrooms than 20. 

I didn't put mozzarella on and while every loved the first few we tasted we all agreed mozzarella would be the perfect compliment. So I actually put them back in the oven covered in mozzarella for a a few minutes and they were even better than before. So I wouldn't skip that step (I'd read a couple of reviews that mentioned they didn't add the mozzarella but I believe it's a great addition). 

This is definitely going on the list of one of our family favorites.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I modified, used 1/2 the butter and did not use Italian seasoning. I didn't have mozarella, so I substituted mexican mix cheese and used fresh parsley.

Great recipe! I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and canned minced clams and added juice from clams. The bigger mushrooms work better. Will be making these again.

Very good flavor. Served these on Christmas eve and there were mixed reviews. The only thing I would change would be cutting the Italian seasoning in half, I found it a bit over powering. What I really liked about this recipe was that it wasn't heavy like the recipes that call for a lot of cheeses. I was serving a lot of heavy appetizers already so this was a good addition. Pretty sure they were a huge hit with my father because he kept saying "one more" but would grab another as soon as he had finished it. Another bonus - these were easily converted to gluten free because I used gluten free bread crumbs. I would make these again and the only change will be less Italian seasoning.
Also - I made the filling a day in advance. Right before I made them I added the butter, stuffed the mushrooms and topped with cheese. They came out great.

Use no more than 1/8 to 1/4 c. butter for drizzle. Anything more is just a waste of the butter.

This recipe was great and my family LOVED these mushrooms. In fact my mother dreamt about them. I changed it up a little; I bought 7 large button mushrooms and overstuffed them with the mixture before I put the cheese on top. Once I took them out of the oven I gave them an extra hit of coarse salt and grated Parmesan cheese.

Definitely a disappointment. I won't be making this again. The clams are what especially had me excited, but I've had better stuffed mushrooms just using cheese. All the 5 stars have made so many changes but if you make it as is it isn't impressive.

Excellent recipe!!  I baked the mushrooms for 10-15 minutes as a reviewer stated they did to "drain" the mushroom... stuffing I followed to a T... but I like a little kick so added some old bay blackened seasoning.. just a few pinches mixed in.. these are the best stuffed mushrooms I've had... thank you for the great recipe!!

Tried this recipe as an appetizer for Easter and the dish was a big hit!  I think all the flavors went together beautifully.  I did decrease the amount of butter used by half, did not use a bell pepper, no parsley or Italian seasoning because I used Italian style panko bread crumbs.  I also used sliced mozz. cheese in place of shredded.  I just cut the slice to fit the top of the mushrooms.  Will be making again.  My only complaint was that I had alot of juice in the pan once they were done cooking, which I poured out so as not to make the mushrooms soggy.

Way too much butter in this recipe! If I were to make it again, I'd cut the amount of butter in half.  It was tasty, but so intense you couldn't really eat more than one or two.

I have made this many times with rave reviews but I have always reduced the butter by half. I think the amount of butter as stated is totally unnessecary. Recently my hubby has been on a no carb diet, so I have made this with double the green pepper and no bread crumbs. It is not quite as good this way, but it is still really yummy and if you are on a no-carb diet you will want to devour them.

very very good! I followed what another review said and only used 1 can of minced clams and only 1/2 cup of butter. I also didn't have bread crumbs so i used a 1/2 cup of pretzels smashed up and it was great. I had a lot of stuffing left over too so you can use more mushrooms

I made these for a Christmas party at my parent's house.  My sister-in-laws and I decided to use the mushrooms my mom had bought to make stufffed mushrooms.  The only problem was the party was about to start and we didn't have time to make a run to the store for estra ingredients.  I found a can of clams and her cupboard so we decided to try this one.  The mushrooms didn't even make it onto a serving tray.  Someone sneaked one while they were cooling and spread the word.  Before we knew it, they were all gone.   We recieved a ton of compliments.

I was really looking foward to tasting the clams in these mushrooms. I added the 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning (I used Salamida's Italian seasoning) but unfortuinately that is all I could taste, everything else was to a "t". I will try again - but I WILL cut the Italian seasoning down to 1 tablespoon - mayhap even less. Could be the case that Salamida's Italian seasoning is more potent than your average, but sadly, kinda ruined the dish with 2 tbls.

I think the amount of green bell peppers and onion were a bit much, and perhaps a little more bread crumbs were needed... but other than that, great recipe!

I used to work at the Olive Garden and loved their stuffed mushrooms! These are sooo much better!!!!! I made at Christmas and they were gone in no time! Everyone asked for the recipe!!!  I had a lot of stuffing leftover - Mom and I had to buy more mushrooms and had them the next day!!!

I just had to try this and it was a good thing that I did.  I didn't do the clams at all, but you couldn't tell the difference it was still really good.  It was a big hit at the party and I know that I will be asked to make it again.

these are fabulous. made them for a holiday party that was canceled, but was perfectly happy to sit at home and eat them with friends - 2 of whom 'don't do mushrooms' and another who 'doesn't do fish' - all 3 ate these and raved about them.

These were chowed down at last year's Christmas party.  Then I revealed the "secret ingredient" as being clams.  My FIL reiterated his dislike of clams while still finishing his morsel.  Actually a lot of people supposedly didn't like clams and yet the platter was still cleaned out!

It was very good, but i would add more cheese on the inside and on top. And it just needed a little less of something. Maybe the ground cumin. Good though my family like them.

I, like others, replaced a good portion of the butter with the clam juice.  This was really tasty...the only thing I might change next time is put less italian seasoning.  Maybe 1/2 it or put less than that. It was a little overpowering.

i find this a little on the bland side. i love the idea of clams but next time i think i'll use smoked oysters and add a bit of lemon and salt. also as others suggested i'll cut the butter to 1 cup. i think if theses were cooked a little hotter (375-400 f) the mushroom would cook better. i will certainly try it again.

This recipe is delicous! I did make it a little more fast by using pre-minced garlic, italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of italian seasoning and parsley, and dried onion flakes. This recipe is delicous and even my sister--who hates mushrooms--loves these!

I think these are better than the sausage stuffed mushrooms.  It doesn't need so much butter and skip the cheese at the end and then they are perfect.

The secret is the clams! Great recipe. I had way too much mix left over and not enough mushrooms to stuff! I will buy double the mushrooms next time I make these.

When I was shopping for the ingredients for this recipe I accidentally bought crab meat instead of clam meat and didn’t realize it until the next day when I looked the recipe over again. Even though I used crab these came out fantastic! I made them for a community meeting and everyone LOVED them! Not super fast to whip up but easy overall and very tasty.

Received rave reviews. My husband told me these were the best stuffed mushrooms he has ever had. The only change I made was lightly sprinkling the mushrooms with salt prior to stuffing and adding a bit of season-all to the stuffing mixture.

By far my favorite mushroom recipe!  The only thing I change is red pepper for the green and I omit the garlic - found it to be a little overwhelming.

I have tried three or four allrecipes.com recipes for stuffed mushrooms and this is the best I have come across.  Thanks to everyone who reviewed this and made me try it.
They tasted wonderful and were easy to prepare.
I was afraid of the quantity of butter, so I used about 1/2 cup plus the liquid from the clams as another reviewer suggested.  It was still very rich, and I was glad I reduced the butter.
I rarely serve a first-try to guests, but I did this one at the holidays, and guests were so impressed with the flavor.  Reminiscent of Grandmom's clam dressing, but no so gloopy as Grandmom used to make it. :)
A must-try and now the only recipe I will ever use to stuff a mushroom.
Also, as has been mentioned, it makes way too much filling.  It was great on crackers the next day.

Absolutely perfect.  I made one change and sauted the garlic in the butter for about 2-3 minutes.  Best I have ever eaten in a restaurant.

These have been a hit with a crowd both times I made them. If you use small mushrooms, you can easily stuff 40-50 with the mixture.  I like to use the clam juice from one can of clams for moisture and flavor. I also use all the butter and think it is splendid, even if it is incredibly fattening!

Very time consuming, the end result was not worth the time.  Tasted mostly like bread crumbs and was kind of dry.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were great. I used less butter than the recipe called for and it was fine. I also used yellow and red bell pepper instead of the green. I will be making these again and again!

I'm a vegetarian, so I had to replace the clams.  I added a package of cream cheese instead and it was wonderful!  (I know the clams and cream cheese probably don't compare, but it did the trick for me!)

Awesome!! I used real crab meat instead of clams.  There was alot of stuffing left over after filling all the mushrooms so I used it as a topping for sea bass the next day. WOW!! My family loved this as much as the appetizer!! Thanks.

I served these on Christmas Eve and everyone loved them.  I doubled the recipe and made 40 mushrooms and had a ton of stuffing left over.  I also cut way down on the butter because when you double the recipe it calls for 3 cups of butter which is a bit excessive!  I ended up using 3 sticks of butter but would use 1 more next time.. still wouldn't use 3 cups though.  Overall, these were very good and I will probably make them again.

These were ok, my mom liked them but all I could taste was the dried seasonings - way too much! This is probably just a personal preference, but I think I would try another stuffed mushroom recipe before making this one again.  Thanks, though!

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms.  I don't eat them but wanted to make them for my guests.  Several times I heard, "these are the best mushrooms I've ever had."  So needless to say, I will be making them again.

I used up an Italian cheese blend I had sitting in the fridge instead of the parm and mozzarella. Also, I omitted the green bell pepper and onion and added 2 green onions and a few mushroom stems. I made a half recipe and used about 1/4 cup butter for the mix then used butter spray to "drizzle" on top - still incredibly delicious!

These are the best stuffed mushrooms ever!    
I took them to an office party, and all the other ladies asked for the recipe.  My  son hated mushrooms until he tried these.  
Definitely a recipe to hold onto.  
I also made no changes to the recipe, and they were perfect.  I do keep the mushroom stems to use in other dishes.

These were GREAT!  I followed others advice and used a mixture of clams and crab.  I used all of the stuffing mixture on almost 30 mushrooms!  I will be making this again, and again, and again...Thank you for posting.

Absolutely wonderful and very easy to make.  I generally increase the amount of clams and decrease the vegetables.  A little less colorful, but just as good.

The best stuffed mushrooms.  I usually have too much stuffing so I either buy more mushrooms or freeze the leftover stuffing for later.  Great for parties.  Everytime people burn their fingers because they want to eat them as soon as they come out of the oven.

Because of other comments on too much butter, I only used 1/2 cup butter in the filling and didn't drizzle any on top before I baked them. They came out just fine!

Served these for a formal dinner party last night.  Not one left out of a very large pan!  Like some of the other reviewers, I thought the mixture was a little too dry and would probably cut down on the bread crumbs.  Did reduce the butter as others suggested so this may have contributed to the dryness.  Used Crab meat and Clams.  Absolutely wonderful.  Will definitely make this one again and again.  Recipe does make a ton of mixture...double the mushrooms and you'll still have plenty.  Thanks so much Dinah!!!

I made these for a dinner a few weeks ago and I has the hero. I personally don't eat mushrooms, but I made enough to fill a 9" X 13" pan and everyone was gobbled up and there were only 5 of us. I did add a bit of low fat cream cheese since I felt the mixture was a tiny bit dry, but I don't think that added too much since it was such a little bit I added. This recipe makes a TON of mixture. Great party dish.

this is a good recipe. i have made it twice so far and it was excellent so far. only downfall is it is really greasy from the butter. so to those who aren't into really oily things watch out for this one.

These were awesome!  I made them for my family and they were all gone before we ate our main dish.  I used about twice as many mushrooms, crab instead of clams and provel cheese.  Also, to make this more Atkins friendly, I used homemade bread crumbs that were made from Healty Life low carb wheat bread.

Everyone said these tasted just like Olive Garden's (which is a huge compliment). I used crab instead of clams, but next time I might try a mixture of both. Everyone wants to borrow this recipe now!

AWESOME RECIPE!!!  If this gets rated low by someone then they cant follow directions. The partygoers at my last party were litterally camped around the mushrooms. I didnt drizzle on as much butter as the recipe called for but I am sure it still would have tasted great. Give this a try!!!

These were good.  I added a can of crabmeat in addition to the clams and cut the amount of butter used in half.  Squeezing the fresh lemon juice over the mushrooms is a must as it really brings the flavors out.

This was really, really great. Even my picky husband said "Wow, these are good. Better than the restaurant." And they're pretty easy, too.

Very tasty.  Yum!!!  I did use less butter like the other reviewers suggested.  I also didn't have any mozzarella cheese so I sprinkled some grated cheese on top before baking.
