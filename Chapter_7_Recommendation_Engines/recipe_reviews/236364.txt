Good recipe!  Ragu is my go-to sauce.  I love the sausage as another poster has said.  I never use ricotta, though.  I tried it once and thought it as bland -- and twice the price of cottage cheese.  So I use cottage cheese.  :-)

I mad this lasagna and added meat to it. It turned out good, but the noodles were undercooked! What I plan to do next time is cook the noodles for about five (5) minutes so they aren't really done and still hard enough to where they won't tear easily. I can do it in the same pan I brown my meat in to cut the dish usage. All in all, it's a great idea, it just didn't work as well for me as I thought it might.

I honestly think this recipe is underrated! This was my very first lasagna to make myself. I substituted ricotta for 2% small curd cottage cheese (try to drain the liquid a bit before you add it to your mixture) and I added ground beef, a sprinkle of Italian seasoning, oregano, onion and garlic powder to the sauce. I baked it for 55 minutes covered, 5 minutes uncovered to melt the cheese a bit more on top. It was amazing! I'm not a cottage cheese fan but it tasted delicious in the lasagna. It was creamy and full of flavor. My super picky 2 year old (who often skips meals because she doesn't want to eat) licked her plate clean and asked for seconds! THIS NEVER HAPPENS! Thanks for a wonderful recipe and new addition to my dinner list!

It was a great base..I added saut√©ed onions and bell pepper along with ground Italian sausage to the tomato sauce...I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese. It turned out great!

I make it a few times a month. Like with anything, you add what you personally like. Sometime I brown sausage and hamburger to go in it. Also selecting different flavor sauces make a difference. I do generally add more cheese, but again that's my personal preference.

Decent base recipe.  I used the no boil noodles.  I would suggest browning some italian sausage and then adding the sauce to it after draining.  This recipe is lacking a little on flavor, but the sausage adds the perfect touch.

Very easy to prepare. I added meat and used cottage cheese instead. It is good and I will make it again. The only complaint I might have is that it is a little dry, I will use more sauce next time. Other than that its very tasty without having to go through the normal long steps for lasagna.

My husband loves Ragu spaghetti sauce by itself. This is a good, easy recipe if you like the spaghetti sauce by itself. I added ground beef to the spaghetti sauce and cheddar cheese on the top.

I made it as is. I won't be making it again. For me, lasagne needs meat & I prefer cottage cheese over ricotta.

I love this recipe. To help the noodles cook, I put very little hot water around the edges, to help them cook, and tightly seal with tin foil. Water makes a big difference. I also add some parsley to the ricotta cheese mixture, a personal preference.

This is a great recipe I've been using for years. I also add a small can of Pato sauce (Mexican tomato sauce) sometimes to spice it up a little.

Kid friendly recipe. I've made this twice now with cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese and kids love it. Clean plates every time. Served to 10 kids the first time and 5 kids the next time. Can't go wrong with this one. Husband thinks it needs meat...I don't mind skipping the meat since this is so simple.

Great easy recipe.  I did not use no boil lasagna and it still came out very good.  Also, I used shredded Parmesan instead of grated.  I used many different seasoning for my meatless grounds (oregano, minced garlic, garlic powder and a little salt).

Great basic recepie - but needed alot of work; Use cottage cheese instead of ricotta, follow the directions on how much water to add on the lasagna box (on top of what the recipe calls for).  Be sure to uncover and cook an additional half hour (1hour isn't enough). Ragu sauce is cheap and gross, use a better sauce and the fish will turn out significantly better!

I made it as written but I've also made it with some different pasta sauces and it's always a winner.  Hubby eats it and he is very picky.

This is a great recipe that I‚Äôve been making for many many years, but there is an error in this as well as on the other variations of it online. The pasta sauce needs to be mixed with water in order to create the boiling for the noodles to cook. I do about half-and-half, with a little bit more sauce than water. I also include seasoned ground turkey that is cooked and then added to the ricotta mixture, so all the seasonings are still obvious.

Added more Italian seasoning and fresh basil to the sauce, also added 1/4 c of water to thin it out. Added ground turkey w/ garlic, salt and pepper. Added fresh parsley and black pepper to the ricotta mix. I also  baked an extra 20 mins so the noodles were not so hard.. will make it again, Yum!!

This was my very first time cooking a lasagne and it turned out pretty good! My son said it was delicious!! What I used differently were organic brown rice lasagne noodles, Hunts garlic and herbs sauce and I added ground chicken.  The seasoning on my ground chicken gave the recipe flavor.  I think I should have cooked it a little longer than 1hr 10 minutes because my noodles were done but not as soft as they should be. 

Also, I think the Hunts sauce may be a little to watery for lasagne because when I cut a piece there is watery mix in the pan but it was what I had in my cabinet. I will put it back in the oven for a little while tomorrow. I need to clean the oven because some of my sauce spilled over. I agree with one of the other post that it's too much ricotta cheese so next time I will use half ricotta or try cottage cheese. Overall, it was a very easy recipe and absolutely delicious!!

It turned out perfect. I added hamburger meat and boiled the lasagna noodles five minutes like someone suggested. I also added 1/4 cup of parsley flakes to the ricotta and mozzarella mixture. I added about an 1/8 cup of water to the sauce mix.

This recipe came out good! I used the no boil noodles and I added onion, Italian season, garlic powder and ground beef to the sauce. I didnt use ricotta cheese and added 14oz of mozerell and cheddar cheese instead.. Just not a ricotta girl. it was totally easy to make..

Great easy weeknight lasagna.  I use 1 container ricotta instead of 2 which is enough for us.  I also use no boil noodles.  super easy.  Family loves it.

I added 1 lb hamburger and  a log of sausage plus doubled the Itailian seasoning and garlic powder.  I also added a cup of diced green sweet peppers and a whole onion diced. I always use cottage cheese as  riccota is boring and pricey. I used Marinara sauce instead regular spaghetti sauce. Much tastier with marinara. The result was delicious along asiago garlic bread toasted.

Very simple and tasty. A great base!  Didn't have enough ricotta so used cottage cheese too.  Sooo good
