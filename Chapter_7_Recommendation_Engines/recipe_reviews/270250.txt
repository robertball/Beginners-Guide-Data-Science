This is a pretty darn good meal. And easy too! The biggest issue I had though, was the cook time. Mine took at least an extra 20 minutes for the potatoes to be fully cooked--and watch them closely, as they brown on the outside, but won't be fully cooked on the inside. I also threw in a couple chopped carrots because, why not? For next time, I would also either reduce the amount of chicken broth, or up the overall honey-mustard amount. I found the honey-mustard flavor to be a tad watered down with that much broth. That's just my personal preference though. I also had a green onion that needed to be used, so I threw that in at the end. Oh, and I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. The recipe didn't specify the chicken thighs used, so that's what I went with. Overall, a very good recipe! Thank you!

In general, I didn’t like the flavor, but that’s just a personal thing. Some things I did a little differently that might help others that want to try it. I don’t like dark meat, so I quartered chicken breasts instead. I still baked it at 400, but only baked it for 40 minutes and the chicken was perfect. Instead of putting the potatoes in the oven raw, I steamed them in the microwave for 6 minutes and then added them to the meat marinade. Someone else suggested using less chicken stock and I agree, perhaps by half.

Loved it. Used fresh rosemary cause i have a huge bush of it. Used citrus blossom honey, amazing. I ate this dish for 4 days straight. It got better each night. I used the potatoes/onions in the morning with some scrambled eggs.. omg...

It was really good! I used skinless boneless thighs ( just over 1lb) and halved it since there are only 2 of us. Didnt have regular yellow mustard so i used spicy and left out the pepper. I marinated with the onions but left out potatoes. I was planning on using a bag of “steamables “ and tossing them in the sauce after to save time but went with green beans and rice. I also saute’d 10 min ( which I think helped to thicken the sauce) on med/hi and baked for 20 min. Over all it was super easy & only one pan to clean after! Definitely making again...

This was way too liquidy and way too sweet. It was just ok. I won’t make again.
