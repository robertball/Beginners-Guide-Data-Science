I was disappointed with these beans.  For one, it took a lot of ingredients and time, and two, I was looking for a really good bbq bean recipe.  I made this yesterday for a super bowl party, and the whole thing just didn't jive right with me.  It was kind of like a chili, but with a bbq taste.  I didn't care for the bacon and hamburger in there and I I love these ingredients.  All I can say is, people got a bowl, took a bite or two and set it aside, including myself. I followed the recipe exactly too. It sounded good at first, but all together, it didn't taste right for me. Sorry.

Took this to our cul-de-sac cook-out everyone (especially the men) loved them and came home with an empty crock pot.  Going to make them again for family reunion next week in Texas.

I make every year for July 4th picnics. Everyone loves it!! I cook the ground beef and bacon a couple of day earlier and soak the beans for 12 hours the day before. I use a crock pot and cook on high, 12 hours or low 24 hours. These beans can be difficult to soften, so start early!

I made this, and did not care for it.  The alcohol smell was very powerful, and just seemed to intesify the longer is cooked.  I won't be making this ever again, sorry.

These were good, and I would definitely consider them a main dish instead of side due to the three types of meat in it.  I would think about making them again but would add some garlic and subtract the honey next time.  I didn't feel good about the sugar content between the barbecue sauce, honey, and maple syrup.

Turned out to have a good Smokey / sweet flavor with a hint of bourbon . Beans definitely need time to cook

Loved These beans but I did not put the bourbon in and I used one and a half bottles of barbecue sauce and it turned out perfect.

Not super impressed. lingredients lead me to believe there would be more barbecue flavor. Mot so.  Even with all the great ingredients, this was a little bland.
