I know the ingredients call for a beef chuck roast, but I think it's actually supposed to be a PORK roast, like the write up states ("Simple but absolutely delicious cranberry PORK roast!")... I can't imagine a cranberry sauce with beef, but who knows... I chose pork, since fruit sauces are usually a good complement, and it turned out fantastic! My husband wolfed it down and normally he's a very slow eater... Don't worry about it not having much liquid to begin with-- I stared into my crockpot for quite awhile debating if I needed to add water (my hubby even peered over my shoulder and commented on how dry it looked compared to my other crock pot recipes) but I went on faith and followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great (the cranberry sauce quickly "melts" and turns into a watery stew for the meat to cook in). Yes, this is a sweet recipe, but it's sweet like BBQ sauce is sweet (it tastes appropriate and not remotely like cranberry sauce-- trust me, I'm not a big fan of the stuff)... I'm also not a big fan of pork, but I am a HUGE fan of crock pots and know that otherwise dry/tough meat ALWAYS turns out fabulous in it.... Give this recipe a try-- your tastebuds will thank you for it!

I've been making this for years, my family loves it.  The last four hours of cooking I add baby carrots and cut up potatoes and sprinkle a second bag of onion soup mix on top of them. This recipe is fabulous!

I thought this might turn out wierd, but had to try it because it seemed so easy.  It was great!  It doesn't taste like cranberries (I used a store-brand of cranberry sauce), but formed lots of nice, brown-type gravy to serve over my garlic-roasted mashed potatoes.  I used one fresh 3-lb chuck roast and one .5 lb rump roast (from the freezer) and prefered the rump roast because it wasn't so fatty.  So next time, I'd just do a rump roast instead.  I added some baby carrots to the crockpot and those were great too.  Luckily I bought two cans of cranberry sauce so I can make this again!

No, it's not a mistake: this is for a beef chuck roast (but feel free to use pork, I guess). What a revelation! I've made pot roast for years, but would never have guessed that cranberry sauce would produce a nice browned roast (in a slow cooker!) with such rich gravy. I used water and corn starch to thicken the gravy, instead of the butter & flour in the recipe. We had it over egg noodles, but next time I'll add quartered potatoes and baby carrots, because I think they would go well with this. If so, I would also add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water, to produce a little more gravy for cooking the vegetables.

WOW!!  What a great recipe!!  Kids even loved it.  I did not have the dry onion soup mix so I substituted the soup mix with 4 tsp beef boullion, 8 tsp dried onion flakes, 1 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp pepper. I also added 2 carrots sliced up. Thanks for the fantastic meal!!

This was wonderful, different and sooooooo easy. I used stewing beef that I had on hand. I placed the beef in the slow cooker and dumped the soup mix in and gave it a quick stir, then I dumped the can of cranberry sauce on top, covered and let it go all day. I also used whole berry cranberry sauce since thats what I had in my cupboard. I liked it that way but the kiddies prefer without the berries so I will make it that way next time. I served this over egg noodles and it was absolutely amazing! I just couldnt get over how easy this was to make. You really cant get any simpler. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This is absolutely the best and easiest slow cooker roast recipe!!  I've made it twice, first with beef (arm) roast and second time with pork loin roast. The arm roast didn't produce enough liquid so I didn't need to thicken the sauce.  In future would use chuck roast because the sauce tasted a little charred since it was slightly thick.  The pork roast was awesome!!  I thickened the pork juices with corn starch instead of flour/butter, and loved it!  Used whole berry cranberry sauce both times.  Did not add any additional liquid--just the whole cranberry sauce--and it was perfect!

I made this as written with the exception of choosing to use the ocean spray whole berry cranberry sauce. I'm extremely surprised how much juice this created in the crock pot with out adding any liquid at all. I did use a beef chuck roast but I can see how this would be terrific with pork as well. For those who had trouble with the butter and flour. Its a roux so: In a 2 cup glass measuring cup melt your butter in the microwave the add flour and mix with fork. Then slowly ladle juice from the crock into the cup and mix with fork. It will thicken almost immediatly. Continue until you have added enough to make 2 cups making sure your smoothing it with for in between adding liquid. Then add to crock pot, this will ensure your gravy (which is amazing) does not clump. If you choose to use cornstarch dissolve cornstarch in water prior to adding to the gravy mixture. I also suggest cutting back the cornstarch to 1 tbs and not simply subbing it for the flour as cornstarch thickens at twice the rate of flour.

The flavor of this roast was surprisingly excellent!  I was a bit leery when I read the recipe; but so many people rated it highly that I went ahead and tried it.   It was GREAT and my husband snarfed all the leftovers the next day.    We will certainly make this again.

Didn't change a THING! This is FABULOUS! Roast was amazing! Gravy was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Served the gravy over the meat and over mashed potatoes. Try this! It's to DIE for!

This was OK, nothing fabulous. I liked the gravy, but it was a little sweet for meat. I think I would like the gravy on noodles or potatoes, but not really for meat. Husband didn't want to try it at first, but once he did he really liked it.  I'd make it again for him, but not for me. (and I love cranberries! go figure....)Made it again, this time I really liked it. I don't know what changed, but I like it a lot & hubby asks for it frequently & I am happy to make it now.

Great recipe! I used beef. Also added quartered potatoes and carrot chunks about 4 hours before it was done as one reviewer suggested. Everything was DELICIOUS! I also used cornstarch in a small amount of water to thicken instead of the butter and flour. Thanks for the recipe.

Reicpe was very good not only with a beef roast, but with pork roast, chicken breasts and cut up chicken.  My family raved about all the cuts of meat and poultry they tried it with.

Wow, thought this was too good to be true. I used a smoked pork shoulder, didnt change a thing and the gravy was perfect. Mashed potatoes a must have to take full advantage of the gravy. This will be a regular meal in our home.

This was fabulous.  I used a 5 1/2 lb pork roast, 2 pkgs of onion soup mix and 1 can of jellied cranberry sauce and 1 can of whole cranberry sauce, that's all I had in the house.  Next time will use only the whole cranberry sauce, although it was perfect this way.  The pork was fork tender.  Didn't thicken the gravy/sauce at all just spooned it over the sliced pork.  This is the only way I'll fix a pork roast in the future!

This is an awesome recipe for any roast. I have made it with beef and with pork tenderloin and it was equally delicious each time. I would recommend putting the cranberry sauce into a bowl and mashing it up before pouring it on top.

This roast was fantastic!   I used the leftover gravy and made Slow Cooker meatballs the following day.  I served it over a bed of rice and my teenager loved it!  Very Highly recommended!!

Wow....I never would have thought that the combo of ingredients in this recipe went together but they do! So simple and delicious ..... I used cornstarch and water to thicken the juices instead of butter and flour. Sweet yet savory all at the same time. Thanks!

This recipe was great!!  I did not need to add the butter and flour.  I served it with Kluski noodles and the sauce was great on top!  Turned the slow cooker to high for 4 hours, but I am sure it would have been even more amazing on low for the full 8 hours.  We ate up the leftovers with a big smile!!  Will definitely make this again.

This roast came out pretty good.  I did add some mushrooms because I love them.  I also added carrots and potatoes, but wont do that again as I didn't care for the flavor that they absorbed (didn't factor that into my rating).  Plus, they took forever to cook, so I'll just prepare them separately next time.  I also thickened with cornstarch/water in the end.  BF liked the meat but not the gravy, but I liked the gravy a lot.  Very simple meal, I'll keep cranberry sauce on hand for this now.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very good.  Used with a pork roast because that is what I had.  Thought the gravy was wonderful especially over mashed potatoes.  Will for sure use again!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It could not be easier.  I, too, add salt and pepper to the roast beforehand.  I've also made it with a pork loin, but cut the cooking time down to 7 hours.  For added flavor, I saute some mushrooms and add to the gravy.  Thanks Kim for such an easy recipe that produces such great results!

I made this exactly as written and found it a little bland. Both my husband and I thought it was good, but we definitely had to salt our servings. Next time I'm going to salt and pepper by roast beforehand to kick up the flavor.

This was one of the better slow cooker recipes that I have tried lately. The gravy was the right consistency and had just a hint of cranberry flavor to it. Would make again using other cuts of meat or the round roast which I used to make it with.

This was the best thing I've ever put in my mouth!!!! followed the recipe exactly except drizzled a little bit of oil in the crock pot before adding the roast and then put some seasoning on top of roast (garlic powder, seasoning salt & staek seasoning) YUMMY!!!

I made this with a pork loin because I didn't have all the ingredients to make the Taste of Home "Slow Cooker Cranberry Pork" recipe which can be found on this site.  I was disappointed and will not make again.

I thought this was easy and awesome.  We followed the directions to a T and it was great.  I served over egg noodles.  This made great leftovers too.

This was pretty good but i think i will use a different cut of meat next time. While the meat was flavourful, it was dry which i think has little to do with the recipe.  Base don other reviews, and the reported sweetness of the gravy, i made mine slightly different. I strained the sauce then put it on the stove adding 1/2 cup of warm water with corn starch. This thickened nicely and was slightly sweet but not overpowering. I will try this again for sure.

So tender and delicious! I added small amount of water to start, but may not have had too.  It was falling completely apart when done.  Yum!

Fabulous!  I made this with a pork butt roast (boneless shoulder, 3 lb).  I didn't change anything other than the meat and it turned out amazing.  My boyfriend raved about it.  As other reviewers have said, the gravy is sweet, but not unbearable.  I really liked the gravy a lot!  This recipe is going in my normal rotation!! Try this recipe!!  You won't be sorry.

Just okay. The gravy is a bit sweet. Overall it's just okay. I probaby will not make this again. At least not the exact same way.
On a side note if you are worried about putting just dry onion mix on the bottom, don't be. The meat really does produce enough juices to make a good...but too sweet gravy.

Fantastic! I love this recipe as is but have also made various substitutions according to what we have on hand. Venison roast was great! apricot preserves & vegetable soup mix, etc. I make it a point to try to keep cranberry sauce in the pantry now just for this recipe.

Good way to use up cranberry leftovers fr`om Tday.  It was okay, not spectacular.  I wouldn't go out of my way to make it--it's only a means to use extra cranberry dressing.

This was absolutely delicious! The only change I made was using whole berry cranberry sauce. I tried the gravy before putting it on the roast and was worried it would be too sweet, but it went well with the roast. I served this with egg noodles, and next time will try mashed potatoes. 

Edit: I made this again with pork roast and the beef roast was waaaayyyy better. Too sweet with the pork roast. Also, in the last hour of cooking, i shredded the roast and put it back in, otherwise it would've been dry. I did NOT have to do that with the beef, just the pork. The beef was nice and juicy.
I won't be making again with pork, only with a beef roast. I don't know why everyone makes it with pork.

For me, this combo of flavours is just wrong!  I used beef for this, and in my opinion it completely ruined the flavour of the meat.  Perhaps pork roast would be better, but I don't think I will be trying it.  Very disappointed, as was my husband.

Like the call that others heard, this recipe did whisper, “This sounds like it would be good with a pork roast.”  After Thanksgiving our small, “just the 2 of us” turkey leftovers were gone but, as usual, the sides lingered. Half a can of jellied cranberry sauce is always a challenge to use. I used a little pork tenderloin roast from my freezer I could serve the leftover mashed potatoes and even the cornbread dressing. I started out with the pork mostly frozen, only thawing a bit to remove the vacuum wrap. I did slice the cranberry sauce and lay the slices over the top of the roast. It looked prettier loading the crockpot, but one lump or slices, if left in the pot undisturbed, the cranberry doesn’t really melt. It gets really soft though and is then easily stirred into the onion soup and meat juices in the bottom. I used the whole envelope of onion soup thinking that, with only ½ cranberry, it wouldn’t be as sweet as some who thought it too much. I thought the onion gravy was very tasty. Kind of tangy, but no one would guess the cranberry addition. I didn’t add the butter or any thickener at all, it was a pretty nice sauce / gravy consistency as it was. I wouldn’t buy cranberry sauce simply to make this recipe again, as I have other favorite ways of making pork roast, but I’d make it again with leftover cranberry.

This is amazing! I told my brother if he didn't go buy a crockpot today and make it tommorrow..I will know he must be on drugs. LOL It was so tasty and the gravy is awesome! I used a sirloin roast and flipped it after 5 hrs to keep the top moist. You do not need extra liquid..it will produce PLENTY. I will definately make this again and again! Thank you so much!

edit: I just ate the leftovers for lunch and I think they may have been even better than yesterday IF that is possible. I really loved this recipe!

I too was a little skeptical. Plus, my husband doesn't like roasts, but I make htem anyway because they're easy, and he eats them and just doesn't say anything about it. But this one he said was "Deeeeelicious! Definitely keep that recipe and make it again!" He never says that about ANYTHING so I'm giving this one 5 stars just for his reaction.  But  I loved it too, especially the gravy which was sweet but really not cranberry-y.

I made this using a pork roast as another reviewer suggested.  It was good, but not great.  I’m generally not a fan of dry onion soup mix, but I decided to give this a try anyway.  The sauce didn’t thicken up well for me and was rather thin.  I would make this again if I were pinched for time, because it goes together in about two minutes.

I used a pork shoulder roast, not beef.  This was incredibly easy, and though at first it seemed like it would be dry, and I was worried when the cranberry sauce didn't melt in the first couple hours,  but by the time it was in the slow cooker for the full 8 hours, it turned into a wonderful moist pork roast.  Everyone raved about it. Even my picky-eater 10 year old grandson!

This, obviously, was really simple to make. We used chuck roast, but someone in the house cut the roast up because they didn't understand the concept of a roast (cough*mom*cough) so I cooked it for just over 5 hours instead of 8. The meat was perfect (no pink, I wouldn't mind it pink). The sauce was not sweet at all for me or those who ate it here. Next time I think I'll use two cans of cranberry sauce instead of one. 

Still, it was delicious and would love to eat the left overs now instead of getting take out (but I must for a school fundraiser!). 

I served it with mashed potatoes.

Wonderful flavor!  I made this with pork loins, which literally fell apart, but that allowed the sauce to cook into the meat even more.  Husband said this is a keeper!  I did not need the butter/flour at the end; it was plenty thick enough (I even added a bit of water to give us enough sauce for noodles)

This recipe is awesome! It is so simple and the gravy is so thick and tasty. I love this recipe so much I now make it on a weekly basis, the family can't get enough! Gravy goes great over mashed potatoes, or any potato.

absolutely one of the BEST recipes I have ever made from this site.  My hubby was still talking about it to his friends the next day, it was that good.  Extremely easy and well worth it.  Outstanding.

This is my favourite recipe ever!!  The roast comes out perfectly, and the gravy is too good to be believed!!  If there was ever any gravy left, it would be great over chicken or turkey, too, but alas, there is never any left!!  If I could give 10 stars, I would - it's that good!!

I followed the recipe exactly, using a 3 lb. chuck roast.     This recipe was SO easy, and it made plenty of gravy!    For me, the gravy had an overpowering onion flavor.   I'll definitely make this recipe again, but I'll try a dry soup mix with a lighter onion flavor next time (like golden onion).

This was awesome! So good and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add the butter to the gravy. I didn't miss it at all. The gravy was a little sweeter than "regular" but it made it that much more special. The cranberry flavor wasn't overpowering at all. I will definitely be making this again!

I do not like cranberry sauce (or gravy generally), but really enjoyed this meal (w/ lots of gravy!)   I was hesitant with only adding the dry ingredients with the can of cranberry sauce, so I added about 1/4 c water to the dry onion mix.  I do not think it was needed though...there was plenty of liquids once the roast was done (1/4 c wouldn't have been missed).   I also added carrots and potatoes at about half way through the cooking - came out great!  Thanks for sharing!!

Exceptional recipe. We are a family of 6, so I doubled it and it came out just wonderful. The entire family raved over the gravy. All the roast is gone from one sitting, but I reserved the gravy. I'm going to toss it with some pre-made meatballs and serving over rice for lunch the next day.Thanks for posting the recipe! It's a keeper!

I really liked this. Contrary to what I expected, it really did not have a very cranberry-y taste. It was, however, really good. I made it with pork roast, thinking that pork & cranberry would be a better combination, but now knowing what the gravy tastes like, I'll try it with beef. 4.5 hours on low was enough to cook it through and I think next time I would slice the pork and put it back in, because it was just a tad dry (not really a problem with that gravy, though!).

We didn't care for this all that much.  The flavours were not so compatible.  And we like cranberries in most everything.  As well, the meat did not tenderize the way we generally like it.

I used a rump roast and the meat turned out wonderfully.  I couldn't get past the sweet gravy, though.  I really wasn't a fan of this gravy on mashed potatoes.  If you like the combination of sweetness and beef, this recipe is great.  I probably wouldn't try this again, but do realize it would be to some people's taste.

this was fairly decent. i added carrots, parsnips, onion, celery, and potatoes. i poured the soup mix (i used two packets) over the veggies and stirred. i seasoned the roast w salt and pepper, and placed it on top of the veggies. then i spread the cranberry sauce (i used two cans) over the top of everything. i also used 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed w two tbsp cold water to thicken the gravy. it was okay....definitely will use more herbs next time for a better ratio of sweet and savory. the gravy was good, but maybe next time i would use half cranberry sauce and half beef broth instead.

I have been making this for years and although the ingrediants sound a little strange, it is absolutely delicious! I leave out the butter (I can't tell it's in there) and add mushrooms and onions. I've also used both pork and beef and think both are good. I usually thicken up the sauce a little bit and use as gravy for mashed potatoes... unbelievable! It doesn't hurt that it makes your house smell incredible!

This was a very good recipe!  Even my 11 year old ate it without complaint.  I only made slight changes...I dredged the roast in flour and browned it in some olive oil.  I whisked the onion soup mix and 1/4 cup of sweet vermouth. I used whole cranberry jelly.  I did not use the butter but used some of the drippings to thicken the gravy.  I plan to use more cranberries next time!

All the rave reviews on this recipe convinced me to live on the edge & try it for our holiday dinner – all I can say is: WIN!!    I used 2 pork tenderloin roasts, tied together, rolled the meat in the onion soup mix & sliced the whole cranberry sauce over the top.   I turned the roast a couple of times during cooking to be sure that every inch of it had an opportunity to baste in the juices.  Everyone at the table [even the cranberry-haters] had only positive things to say about the meal [& they weren’t just being nice!!].   Not too sweet, not too dry, tender, succulent with an over-the-top gourmet feel about it!   The kids took the EASY recipe home, eager to try it in their new slow-cooker! I definitely look forward to making this again in the near future – it’s a no-fail recipe.   Thanx so much, kim!

Everyone loves this.  Also good with chunks of potatoe and onions put on the bottom first before other ingredient.  I've also tried this by using only about 2/3 the onion soup mix on the bottom of the roast and reserving the last 1/3 to mix with the cranberry jelly.

I really didn't care for this, and neither did the hubby. We're both fans of cranberry sauce, but this was too much! All I could taste was the cranberry. In the words of my hubby "This would be great if you don't want to taste the meat!" I will say that it looked beautiful and the gravy had a loverly texture... too bad we didn't care for the flavor.

maybe its because i used a venison roast, maybe i wasn't heavy handed enough with the garlic. I just found the flavour to be lacking and the tartness of the cranberries wasn't as plesant as anticipated. i'll try it again but it wasn't a favorite.

YUMTASTIC! I used a 3lb chuck roast and followed the recipe to a tee. SO easy ..the meat just melted in the juices and everyone at it up. It served 5 adults and 2 toddlers and we had a small portion left. Not bad! Will make again. :)

i made this w/a venison roast and it turned out wonderful. i didnt have the onion soup mix so i sprinkled the roast w/ garlic salt and pepper.then i sliced the jellied cranberries on top of the roast and placed 2 beef cubes on it. the jellied slices kept sliding off the roast so i let them go to the bottom and submerged the cubes in them so they would dissolve. i also sprinkled some dried onion in it. i basted it every now and then but i am not sure it needed it. the sauce reminded me of cocktail meatballs. i bet this could be made w/ grape jelly and chili sauce. GREAT recipe. tasted like i slaved all day over it. this was awesome on a rough garlic chive potato mash.

I've made this several times - it has a good flavor but you definitely need to salt/pepper your meat before adding cranberry sauce.

This was very good.  I love anything cranberry, so for me the sweet taste was not overpowering at all.  I used pork tenderloin instead of the roast, and it came out very tender and juicy.  My hubby really enjoyed it, too and we're looking forward to having leftovers tomorrow night!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, only giving the meat a salt and pepper rub before putting it into the crock pot and slicing the cranberry sauce and placing it on the meat.   I used a rump roast and it was so tasty! My husband loved it and wants me to make it again this time trying it with a pork roast.  We didn’t find it too sweet either.

This is a great recipe.  We've made it several times.  We double the cranberry sauce and add 2 packets of onion soup mix and use the extra gravy over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

"Excellent" is what my very picky Hubby had to say about this roast.  When he asked what was on top and I told him, he said, "Interesting ... in a good way."  I cooked this on high for 4.5 hours and it was falling-apart tender.  THANK YOU for this addition to my roast repertoire!

I love this roast. I have made it several times and it is great each time. I follow the recipe exactly. No need to make any changes. Just be sure you have some potatoes or noodles for the gravy. Yum!

My family loved this!!  I was a little unsure using cranberry sauce with a beef roast, but it was fantastic!  The only thing I did different was I took the gravy and thickened it on the stove with cornstarch and water.  My husband likes a thicker gravy.  Great recipe!

My whole family loved this recipe!  I am not a fan of sweet main dishes and saw that some found this too sweet.  I thought it was a very nice taste and not at all too sweet.  I was tired of the same old pot roast with a chuck roast and will definitely be throwing this into the rotation.  I did use 2 table spoons of cornstarch with enough water to thin it out, rather than the butter and ended up adding a cup of water to unthicken the gravy.  I served as others suggested with mashed potatoes, which my husband and son generally don't each much of, but did tonight.  Well worth trying!

This recipe was so quick, so easy and SO delicious!! My entire family loved it - the gravy was awesome on mashed potatos.  I used the leftover beef and gravy the following day and put it over some egg noodles - that was a big hit too.

DELICIOUS! A definite must try and super easy to make!! I only did one thing different - when the meat is done, take the drippings out of the slow cooker and pour in a pot, put on the stove.  Add the flour and butter as stated and make your gravy there! I found it took a long time in the slow cooker and didn't get the gravy texture I was looking for.

I have been making this recipe for years.
I also make it using a 3 pound pork loin and I bake it in the oven in a dutch oven pot.  The gravy this makes pairs well with German Spaetzle.  Always a hit with my family.

This recipe has had wonderful reviews, but the flavor just didn't work for us.  Entree preparation doesn't get much easier, and the house smelled wonderful when it started cooking, but the sauce ended up a little bitter IMO.  Probably just a personal taste preference issue.

I read this and thought yuck those ingredients really don't go well but after reading the reviews thought I have to try this. I'm sorry I thought it was just as gross as I imagined. I am glad so many people like it but it really wasn't to our taste and I am really adventurous.

Fabulous when using extra peaches! My aunt said this was the old fashioned way of making cobbler that she learned from her mother. I used two cans of peaches having read the reviews - but next time I will use three cans as it was a bit too bready for us. We are peach fiends!

This was fantastic and is now in my rotation! I didn't change any of the ingredients. The only change I made was to pour the liquid into a pot and cook the gravy on the stove so I could control the heat and get the gravy done quicker. LOVED IT!

This is a no-fail recipe!  (Unless you forget to turn the crock pot on, I suppose).  Otherwise, it's super easy and super delicious.  I was skeptical at first as I'm not a huge cranberry fan, but that flavor marries perfectly with the onion soup mix and creates a flavor all its own.  This also works well with a pork roast.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Liked it alot, but thought it was on the sweet side.  To balance, I used black and white pepper and a solid dose of garlic.

I skipped the flour and added carrots and potatos as well as some fresh onion.  I also cubed my roast and trimmed it fairly well to reduce the amount of fat.

The fam liked it alot.

This certainly was easy but my husband and I did not care for the excessive sweetness.  I am going to work with the recipe though to get it where we like it-maybe add some garlic and extra onion soup.

This is now my go to recipe anytime I have people over.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Works great with beef and pork.  The meat tastes wonderful but the best part to me is the unique flavor of the gravy.  Fabulous, fabulous idea!  Thank you ATLANTAKIM!

This was very easy. Just open a box and a can and toss 3 ingredients into a pan. I was surprised at the flavor. I didn't taste onion or cranberry. It blended together to give a nice flavored gravy. I love crock pot cooking for the one pot clean up and ease , plus you can cook a meal that takes more than 30 minutes after a long day of work without putting in the long hours of cooking. I don't have very many crock pot recipes yet though and this one will definitely be a regular recipe for my family.

From a 58 year old man still madly in love with his wife after 36 years! Thank you, thank you, thank you! My love is an incredible cook  every once in a while i like to give her a break and I love cooking a special dinner for her. This one went to the top of my list... And hers! We both enjoyed it immensely. I used another reviewers suggestion of using a Pork Roast instead of the Chuck. I cannot thank you enough.

This was wonderful!  I made it exactly as stated. It took me about 2 minutes to throw everything in the crock at 8 before I left for work.  When I got home at 5:30, the house smelled wonderful!  Great flavor, not too sweet, and the meat was super tender and juicy.  This will go into my regular rotation!

The sauce was good but the meat was kind of bland. I made this without any modifications and am rating it accordingly. I bet some of the modifications others have noted will make this better, but I won't try it again.

It was very good--I used leftover real cranberries instead of canned and it was good.  I do think it would be better with pork roast though as that flavor always lends itself to sweet and tangy.  But it was good and I would make it again.

The roast was very good, but the gravy is where it's at!  My family wanted to pour it on everything!  Like a few other reviewers, I thickened it with cornstarch/cold water, but moved it to a saucepan for that step---didn't want to wait for it to boil in the slow cooker.  I will definitely try it using pork, too.  Can't beat the ease or preparation either.

I made this with pork tenderloin for a holiday dinner at my home.  Everyone raved about it!  It was good the next day on rolls as well with a spread of equal parts mayo, sour cream, and coarse Dijon mustard.

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I used a pork roast.  It was delicious - it's a keeper.  Adding the flour and butter to make a thicker gravy is a definite must.

One cold damp day, I needed to cook something easy and hearty. So I came across this recipe and it sounded like something I would like. I LOVE IT!! The roast was sweet and tender and the Cranberry added that extra sweet zest to make it perfect. This was paired with diced medley of skin -on potato, carrot and onion with a Merlot. Ahhhh I remember it well. You will like it I am sure

Excellent! Another quick & easy prep recipe I'll keep. I doubled up on the gravy and froze the left overs for another time  when I can take advantage of the delicious roast drippings.

This was so easy and very delicious!  The roast just fell apart and the gravy was excellent with my garlic mashed potatoes.  The leftovers made fantastic roast beef sandwiches.

This was liked by my whole family and unbelievably easy to put together. To make the gravy, I made a beurre mane by mixing the butter and flour together until it was a thick paste. That worked really well to thicken the juices in the slow cooker. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Delicious and my new favorite roast.  I followed the directions, but substituted onion powder and organic beef soup base for the french onion soup mix to avoid the chemicals.  It was a big hit.  I recommend sticking with the chuck roast as I think it has more flavor.

Flavor: I give this 4*s, ease of preparation: I give 5*s, so since I can't rate 4-1/2*s I'm giving it a 5. I put the meat in (frozen solid) over the dry soup mix and spread the cranberry sauce over as directed. I set it on med-hi for about an hour to defrost the meat some, then brought it down to low as directed. I flipped the meat a few times and towards the end sliced it because it seemed to be cooking unevenly since it's not completely covered in liquid. For the last hour I added about 1TS cornstarch/1TB h20 to thicken the gravy and this worked well. Butter/flour, as written, may have tased better, but to me didn't seem worth the extra cals/fat. The only thing I think I'll do differently next time, and there will be a next time, is to defrost or use an unfrozen cut of meat, and season the meat first, maybe let it sit in the frige overnight with worcestershire, onion and garlic powder, salt & pepper, then proceed with the recipe as written. This isn't something I'd serve to company, but for a busy day it was perfect and the BF absolutely devoured it. Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli as suggested. Some said they prefered rice, which may be good, but I thought mashed potatoes were the perfect side with the gravy. Started it at noon and by 6 it was done- Super simple, hearty meal, good way to use up old pantry items leftover from the holidays!

Oh my gosh, this was WONDERFUL!  My husband, who is NOT a fan of cranberry, and kinda gave me the "uugh" sound when I told him what I had cooking in the crockpot, was absolutely THRILLED with this!  I did the pork roast, and we had rice with it.  The sauce reminded me of sauerbraten, so next time, I will try the beef roast.  Just scrumptious!

I had my doubts but I've come to trust my fellow reviewers. This was ridiculously easy, the flavor was amazing, the gravy very, very easy and tasty. I wisked the butter and flower together and then added about 1/2-3/4 c. of the dripping to it and wisked before adding that to to the rest in the crockpot, it was perfect, not lumpy at all. I let the pot roast itself rest for about 10-15minutes. This is by far the best crockpot pot roast I've ever had. The leftovers, I shredded and I served over mashed potatoes a few nights later and served with sauteed carrots...was like shepherds pie without the baking

Although it was a little sweeter than your traditional roasts it was very good. Our roast got a little dry because we let it cook about an hour extra with the gravy it was excellent.  We made our gravy with some water and cornstarch instead of the butter and flour suggested in the recipe.  We're trying to eat healthier.

This was excellent! My husband and I loved it. I mixed the onion soup mix and the cranberry sauce together with a whisk in the slow cooker, then put the chuck roast in and spooned a little of the sauce mixture on top of the meat. Turned it on low and didn't touch it for 6 hours. My 3 lb. roast was done to perfection and the most moist and tender roast I have made in years. We had more than enough sauce which I thickend with 2T cornstarch & 2T water.I served it with mashed potatoes and baby carrots.We loved the sweetness of the sauce and put it on everything. This just became our favorite pot roast.

Super-easy, and a great smell to come home to at the end of the day. Next time I will substitue my own dried onion and beef bouillon mix for the soup mix, as it was too salty for my taste.

This was so easy and the gravy was wonderful.  I used a pork tenderloin as others had suggested and because I work long hours it was over cooked, I think next time I'll try beef and maybe put it in frozen.

Had that odd taste of fake cranberry gel.  Maybe if you can get GOOD sauce this would be good but with the basic supermarket whole berry can it was a little gross.

I will not be making this recipe again.  The meat came out very dry and the sauce was just too sweet.  It is a very simple recipe so I thought I would give it a try but was very disappointed with the results.

I'm currently on a slow cooker kick (too hot to bake!) and this is recipe number 2 for me. This recipe is just too easy and absolute delicious!!! Went together in just seconds. The whole family loved it, including the finicky 11 year old.  We had it over egg noodles, which was great. Next time it'll be garlic mashed potatoes, which I know will be awesome. If you're a busy mum looking for a quick, mouthwatering meal for your family- this is it!!!

I also made this recipes with a pork roast. I was scared that this recipe might be too salty because of the onion soup mix and no addition of water, but I was so wrong. This turned out wonderful and my 6 year old who is usually fussy about trying new things inhaled this meal! I highly recommend this recipe!

My husband said this is one of the best dinners I have ever made!  However, I thought the gravy was really runny and would not have been good on mashed potatoes.  I made some red potatoes with rosemary in the microwave anyway.  Also, I used a 2 lb pork loin and cooked it for 7 hours.  I used half the onion soup packet and 3/4 can whole cranberry sauce.  It was wonderful!

Great recipe.  If you want it less fatty, use a rump roast instead, and look for one at the store with less fat.  Really any roast will work.  I liked the gravy, and didn't think it was sweet, just tangy.  Delicious with mashed potatoes.

Made this for the second time tonite using a pork roast and cooked it in my pressure cooker instead of the slow cooker. Used all of the same ingredients except used a 2lb pork loin roast and pressure cooked it for 40 minutes. It came out juicy and tender. After I released the pressure, I took the roast out and made the gravy using soft butter and the flour. It was great! We have made this with the beef roast before as well and prefer the pork but both ways get 5 stars.

This was such a surprise. I am not a huge fan of cranberries, my boyfriend loves them yet doubted how they would taste with pork - this turned out excellently. I added extra salad dressing & a bit of teriyaki sauce & brown sugar. I don't think the cooking times are right though as our was done in 4 hours on low.

Not to sound redundant, but WOW!! I made this with a beef roast today. I was concerned that it would just be weird, but with a 5 star rating it was worth trying. This was FANTASTIC!! The kids ate it down. I don't know who was clever enough to put this simple, wonderful concoction together, but THANK YOU!!!

Yes, this sounds weird. But it couldn't be simpler or more delicious!!! I served this today for my family Easter buffet, and it was a big hit. It was very tender, too. I used Lipton Onion and Mushroom (that is what I had) and store brand cranberry sauce. When I took the roast out to make the gravy, I sliced it with an electric knife and put it back into the gravy sliced. Much easier to serve. I will make this one again and again! Thanks for sharing!

This roast was wonderful!  I am not usually a fan of pot roasts but this one was awesome and so easy!  I had my boyfriend start it when I was at work and it was nice and tender when I got home.  He loved it too!  The gravy was sweet which was a nice change from your ordinary gravy.  I will definately make this again.

I was extremely hesitant to try this, but it is delicious!!  I added about 3/4 of a cup of beef broth at the beginning of cooking, but it definitely doesn't need that and next time I'll try it without. The meat is so tender and it makes a delicious gravy!!  To make the gravy, I made it on the stove and I used cornstarch to thicken it.

Oh Yum!  I thought this was great. I  couldn't find dry onion soup mix so I used a can of onion soup which made it  saucier.  I also added dumplings on top.  Very tasty!

Very good!  Have also done with a turkey roast.  I added some extra fat free broth to keep it very moist and keep it from tasting too salty from the onion soup mix.  Excellent gravy!

I was looking for something new and found it. Who would of thought something so easy would taste sooooo good. The only thing I did different was to rub the roast with the Lipton dry onion soup mix and wisk the cranberry sauce until smooth before topping the roast. I personally don't care for gravy but this one was great. Thanks, ATLANTAKIM

This was pretty good- my husband was crazy over it. It was a little tough and dry, but that's probably because I ended up cooking it over the stove instead of in the slow cooker (electricity went out 30 minutes into cooking), so I'm sure the timing was a little off. Good combination of flavors, though!

This will be my go to meal for guests who don't know what time they will be there. There is nothing to preparing this dish and it is so gooood! Throw it into the crock pot, let it cook all day and then make gravy from the pan drippings. Add some mashed potatoes, rolls and a salad and you have a great meal. Also, I used a pork roast about 3.5 lbs. It was excellent.

For tenderness of the pork, it definitely delivered.  There wasn't a ton of cranberry flavor, but I did throw in a pouch of Craisins in the last hour or so of cooking which gave it some pop in bites.  I also cut up an onion and laid that on the bottom. It's a good alternative to a BBQ based pulled pork; I would make it again.

I am very happy with this recipe. My kids loved it too. I did sear my roast before putting in the crockpot. I also added freshly sauteed mushrooms to the gravy after it was thickened on the stove. I can't say if searing made a difference (that is just how I was raised to prep a roast), but the mushrooms were a nice addition.

I really liked the concept actually. It's simplicity means I have more time to do things I'd rather be doing. Instead of onion soup mix, since I am trying to make all things I eat paleo, I just cut up some onion and placed it on the bottom instead. And instead of a can of cranberry sauce, I made it from fresh cranberries and maple syrup.

 At first when the meat came out it was so tender I could barely pick it up with tongs without it falling apart. But I stored it in the fridge for lunches the next day. Even with the gravy I'd made from it (using almond flower instead of wheat flower), it was remarkably dry and hard. A huge contrast from when it first came out. I was very disappointed, but the taste itself was very good. Does anyone know why this might be?

This is a delicious tangy dish.  The roast came out moist and the juices served directly as gravy were fabulous on both the roast as well as on mashed potatoes. I did add a 1/4 cup of water at the start because of other reviews but it was not needed. It was a great twist to the traditional slow cooker pot roast that my entire family enjoyed.

The meat was tender, but we did not care for the cranberry gravy. It just didn't seem to go well with the beef or mashed potatoes. I think it would be delicious with a pork roast and rice, though.

OUTSTANDING!!  It was a hit with the entire family.  I did double the soup & cranberry, to make sure I had enough gravy for the potatoes.  I also added a 1/2 can of water, felt it was odd placing the meat on dry mix, and not starting with any liquid.

Great!  Sprinkle English or Church Roast with garlic & onion granules & pepper (no salt required); sprinkle with all purpose flour just to cover.  Heat EVOO in a pot with NO non-stick surface to get a nice brown color on the outside of the roast.  Watch the heat b/c this surface can get hot quickly and cause everything to stick or burn...not the objective! Also, be sure to brown for about 5 minutes per side but include the narrow ends of the roast.  The goal is to seal in the juices.  Remove roast and set aside.  Thoroughly mix the cranberry sauce & the dry onion soup mix in a bowl.  Reduce the drippings to medium heat and add about 1 cup of low sodium beef broth (add more if desired but not more than 1 cup total).  Stir to incorporate the drippings with the broth, then add the combined cranberry sauce/dry onion soup mix to heat through for about 2 minutes.  This allows all the flavors to be incorporated before adding to the slow cooker.  As well as reducing cook time b/c all ingredients have been thoroughly heated before placing in the cooker. (Pre-heat your cooker slightly too!) I'm always looking for a way to reduce cooking time in the cooker so I can enjoy the meal sooner that the 6-8 hours suggested.  I cooked 5 lb. of roast in 4 1/2 hours on high with an additional half hour to thicken sauce as needed.  Slow cooking requires patience of which sometimes I don't have but this recipe is well worth the wait!  Served with Crashed Hot Potato recipe.

Used on an Arm Roast and it turned out great.  I had added a little water but wasn't needed.  Used my homemade dry onion soup mix - its so easy and cheap to mix up and tastes great.

I made this today with a pork shoulder roast (only roast I had) and it was, as I figured, very easy. I did use my house rub all over it beforehand and roasted for 45 minutes at 500 degrees to brown it up a bit. Slow cooked for 1 hour on high then 4 hours on low. Fork tender and the sauce is like nothing I have ever had. Might have to try the beef next time :) Thanks for the easy recipe!

I never have luck with crock pot recipes. However, I keep trying them with the hope of finding something I like. Finally!!!! This time it was a hit! It was so easy and tasted wonderful. Even my extremely picky 11 year old liked it. This will be a meal I put into our rotation.

This is amazing! Just sweet enough with the cranberries without being too much, roast was so tender and delicious.  I chose not to make the gravy and glad I didn't, I don't think it needs it! There was 'juice' from the onion mix/cranberries at the bottom that worked perfectly with the roast.

Tried after reading reviews as I could not imagine the taste with the ingredients.  I let everyone rave about the taste before I divulged the ingredients. Thank goodness I made enough to freeze as everyone went back for seconds and some thirds on the meat.  A keeper!! Served with mashed potatoes and carrots. I did brown the meat prior to putting in slow cooker and added a sliced fresh onion.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband raves about it.  I did take other reviewers' advice and used a 3 lb pork roast instead of beef.  Makes plenty of delicious sauce!   Served it with peas and mashed potatoes.

This makes the richest yummiest pot roast. One word of warning though, make sure you watch the roast closely. I made the mistake of putting a roast in and then leaving for a few hours while the crock pot was on it's lowest setting. By the time I returned, there was barely enough juice to make a gravy. I use cornstarch and water to thicken it up. Delish!

The short prep time,and few ingredients made it very easy to make a fancy meal with little effort.  My husband doesn't like onions or cranberry sauce and he still liked this recipe.

I made this with pork tenderloin. It was awesome, and so EASY. I did not need to thicken the gravy at all, so I left out the butter and flour. My only changes for next time will be to double the onion soup and the cranberry sauce to make more gravy. I think this would go nicely with macaroni and cheese.

I am not a big roast person, but this wasn't too bad.  I cut out as much fat off the meat that I could and omitted the butter & flour and thickened it with cornstarch- and it was still a little greasy in my opinion.  I did liked the sweetness to it.

This is fantastic. The first time I made it I cooked it on high by accident. The whole thing shredded into bits but I had no choice but to serve it. It was delicious and succulent. It would be great over split rolls as a sandwich too.

Makes a wonderful gravy.  I used with venison instead of beef.  Since this is a less fatty meat, I didn't need to add the flour and butter to thicken the gravy -- it was perfect.  I decided to shred the meat and mix the gravy in.  I think this recipe works better for beef and I'll defintely try that next time.

My bf and I absolutely loved this. I did it with pork though since i had it on hand. The combination of the sweet with the onion is very good and the gravy was great as well (not overly sweet). Definately something I will do again and next time I will try beef!

I've made this twice and it's gets rave reviews.  It's easy, it's tasty and it's fun to watch peoples faces when I say I used a can of cranberry sauce - yes the kind that slides out of the can and jiggles (then everyone makes the sound effect).  This will make regular rotation in my menus.

I hate traditional roast recipes--even the smell makes me ill.  But this is PHENOMENAL!  My roast wasn't quite 3 pounds--it was 2.83 pounds so I cut the cook time down 30 minutes to 7.5 hours.  That was still a little too long---the roast was slightly overcooked.  Next time I will go to 7 hours.  Other than that it was perfect and super easy.  I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans.  Great match!

Excellent Meal! Roast was tender and the gravy was  WONDERFUL. I made a side of rice so we could enjoy the gravy even more! I was very skeptical about the cranberry sauce but it worked well in the dish and turned out great! Didnt change a thing. :)

This would probably be better with a pork roast. But as it was it was pretty darn good. I didnt find it too sweet like others.

I've been using this site for six years; I've tried many, many great recipes but very few of which gave me the wow factor. This one had the wow factor.. It was AMAZING and also a nice change from the average pot roast.

Loved it! I used pork roast instead and whole berry cranberry sauce instead of jellied because that's what I had on hand. Came out terrific! So tender and the taste was great.

I have been dying to try this recipe , and it came out great . I did not half to wait the full 8 hours for the roast to cook , mine was done in 6 1/2 hrs. The sweetness with the roast is very good . Made it exactly as recipe stated , but I think with carrots and potatoes it would be great  also . This is going to be a family favorite for many years to come , thanks for posting this . We all LOVED it !!

WOW...I've finally found my roast recipe!!  I've literally tried dozens and this one was the best by far, so good that I'm just gonna stop looking now.  The whole family loved it.  At first I was a little skeptical with the cranberry sauce but it's amazing.  Gotta love a recipe that is soooo good yet only has a few ingredients!!!  I'll be making this one every Sunday!

The ingredients of this roast struck me as kind of bizarre, but I thought I'd give it a whirl seeing as it got such great reviews.  I was definitely not disappointed!  I used a 2 1/2 pound Angus beef pot roast and it came out great.  I just put it in the crock pot before I left for work in the morning, and it was done by the time I got home.  I removed the meat and thickened the gravy with a little cornstarch, which worked perfectly.  Served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  Yum!

This recipe is simple and excellent! I followed this recipe exactly, except for the choice of meat, for which I tried a beef rump roast (3.25 lbs).  The meat came out so tender I was able to shred it with my hands. The gravy is definitely different, and I would agree with other posts that it tastes gourment.  My boyfriend raved about this dish. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

The meat came out tender, but I thought it was a little too salty with the whole packet of soup mix.  Next time, I think I'll just add half a packet.

This was fantastic!  I did a couple things slightly different.  With the beefy onion soup mix, I added about 1/2cup water and 1 tsp beef soup base to make it a bit beefier (my husband is not an onion fan so I didn't want the onion flavor to overpower the gravy.)  I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and just a pinch of a dried herb mix (parsley, thyme, rosemary, sage, etc.)  I didn't have 8 hours to cook it (and my crock pot runs hot anyway, so it probably wouldn't have taken that long even on low) so I cooked it for about 3.5 hours on high.  For the last 1.5 hours, I added chunks of potatoes and carrots.  It was delicious.  The gravy was so simple to make with the butter and flour, and it was so smooth and flavorful, no lumps at all.  Even our cats loved it, and they are the pickiest eaters in the house -- they hardly ever touch people food!

OMG!!!!! This was fantastic and a must try.  I’m used to always making my roast in the oven and just eating it rare so it could be tender.  This was my first crock pot roast and the thought of fully cooked beef made me and my husband nervous, but this was great.  I did mine exactly has directed with the exception of the onion soup mix because I didn't have any.  Instead I subbed the soup mix for a half tsp of pepper, onion power, onion flakes, season salt and garlic salt.  I let it cook 5 hours, then sliced up the entire roast thin.  Then I put it back in the crock pot gravy with carrots for another hour or so and it was amazing.  I served it with rice, corn and corn bread.  You know it’s good when the husband and the kids are all falling asleep at the table as soon as dinner was over.  Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe.  It’s going in my regular rotation.

We loved this recipe and we don't like cranberry.  The gravy was wonderful and rich and didn't taste like cranberry at all.  The meat was moist and delish.  The gravy was rich and a bit sweet, but not too sweet....just wonderful and yummy.

I love crockpot recipes and this is now my all time favorite!  It really is a simple as it says...sprinkle the onion soup mix, add meat (I used a pork roast) and add the jelly!  (as it slides out of the can I sliced it to distribute it over the meat evenly).  We couldn't stand waiting any longer so we took it out at 6 hours after being on low and it was still perfect!  We did add about 2 cups of sliced carrots and a medium onion at the beginning to adjust for our personal tastes) Will be making this again soon!

So delicious! I used PORK tenderloin (two of them to equal 3 lbs.) because I didn't like the thought of sweet beef. I usually don't even like pork - but this was so so good. It didn't take nearly 8 hours, probably more like 4-6 in my crockpot (on low). Serve with egg noodles or rice. Will make again!

I am shocked there are people who don't like this recipe!  I made this last week and MORE THAN LOVED it! It was soooo easy and so good! I made mine with garlic mashed red potatoes and the gravy was awesome with it! I didn't find it sweet at all, didnt even tast like cranberries.  My husband who is very picky loved it!  I will add this to my weekly line up.  The only thing I did different was topped the roast with Montreal Steak seasoning before the cranberry sauce, to give it a kick.

This turned out really good.  I put a frozen arm roast in the crockpot and cooked on high for a couple of hours then turning to low.  I ended up having to use about half a can of chicken broth at the end and never did need to thicken the sauce as it was already thick.  The flavor is really good...kinda like a bbq sauce.  I will make this again!

This was absolutely fabulous!  I was worried about the lack of seasonings, but I followed the recipe exactly anyway.  They weren't needed. The best part was the gravy.  It only took minutes to make, and it tasted wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was really easy and I will make it again. I followed the recipe exactly (with a BEEF roast). I preferred the gravy served with rice instead of potatoes. I tried it both ways. The sweetness in the gravy goes better with rice for me and my husband agreed. I would think it would be good with pork or even chicken. Thanks!

This was EXCELLENT! So different, but so good! I followed recipe to a T. I also sliced the cranberry sauce to lay on top.
When I took meat out I set aside and put the juices in a saucepan on stove and added corn starch and water to get desired thickness. Wonderful! My family loved it, it will defineitly be a regular meal in our family. I served with red garlic mashed potatoes and broccolli.

Very good, and it doesn't get any easier.  Beef roast tasted like beef, sweetish gravy went well with mashed potatoes.  My 3.5 lb round roast was 160 degrees in 5.5 hrs.  After removing the roast, I strained the juices before adding the butter/flour mixture.  Wife and teenagers liked this recipe, and we'll cook it again.

I was concerned about the beef/fruit combination like others...but it came out very good.  I used a 7 bone roast that I browned well before putting in the crock pot.  My only complaint was that there was not much juice so I did not thicken it.  I served it on top of mashed potatoes.  Will be making again.

yum! and so easy! I used a pork roast and it was amazing. You could also add potatoes and carrots to break up some of the sweetness if you wanted.

This was a really nice change from the traditional savory gravy most roasts make.  The end result was sligtly sweet and well liked by everybody.  Oh...I did omit the butter as I didn't see the point of adding extra fat to the gravy...and the flavor was really nice without it.

This was so good! I used a pork roast and did not add the butter or flour at the end. I stirred in a bit of corn starch and that worked well to thicken the gravy. I think if I were serving it to guests I would have strained the gravy first. It is on the sweet side, but really delicious! Can't wait to try it with beef.

This recipe was easy. I would recommend slicing the cranberry sauce and make sure that it melts down in the juices of the meat. Some of the sauce just stayed on the roast and did not melt into liquid like I thought it would. The flavor was satisfying and the smell was mouth watering. Also, I prefer to season my meat before putting the cooker. I used just salt & pepper. The pepper really brought the cranberry flavor. It was a nice touch.

Followed recipe to the T; roast was tough and didn't really care for cranberry gravy.  It's all a matter of taste/opinion.

This was exceptional.  I made it almost exactly as the recipe called for, except I added an additional small can of cranberries.  My husband said this one was a keeper and my kids devoured it.

I stumbled upon this recipe because I am trying to use up canned goods that have been in my pantry too long. I had 2 cans of jellied cranberry from Christmas and had no idea what to do with them. I guess I'll be keeping my pantry stocked with jellied cranberry from now on. This was great and not too salty (I used reduced sodium soup mix). My husband raved! Thanks for such an easy recipe!

I had a recipe similar to this, which called for ketchup and water.  I used 1 cup each per can of cranberry sauce, and used whole cranberry sauce.  The smell was very unappealing, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor.   I love cranberry sauce, but I could see how some people would not like this.  The cranberry does add a tang.  I liked the flavor with the meat, but did not really care for the extra gravy with the potatoes.  I also used corn starch instead of flour and butter.  Will definitely make again, and try it without the ketchup, too.

This is an amazing good recipe (and easy)! Everyone who has had it as raved... and I've never used anything but a basic chuck roast. Wouldn't change a thing... and by the way, it works with whole berry cranberry sauce as well! Would recommend this to anyone. In fact, I have recommended it to MANY people already... and they all have loved it!

I've made this for year.  It's surprisingly delicious!!  I always skim out the onions before making the gravy (my husband hates onions) and I skip adding the butter because I don't think it adds anything.  I usually serve it over mashed potatoes.  Yum!

This was just OK. Mine turned out a little dry. If I made this again, I would add a little water to the crock pot. I also think this would be better with pork.

As others said, I think this would have gone better with a pork roast but I did give it a shot with beef.  Will make again but with pork.  Thanks

Very good roast. I was torn between using beef or pork but I went with beef and it was great! I used the cranberry sauce that has the berries, it was the perfect amout of sweet. It was great the next day in sandwiches on toasted sourdough. YUM and so super easy!

Made with pork roast and it's outstanding. So simple but so good. Can't wait to try it with beef roast.  Made smashed potatoes and the accompanying gravy was a winner too.

I used whole berry cranberry and the gravy was great.  The roast itself was bland, so I only gave it three stars.  I will use the gravy recipe for pork too, it was good.

This is a great recipe.  So easy and delicious.  We've made it several times and have had success with elk and venison roasts, too.  We often take it to potlucks and it gets devoured. No one ever guesses that the secret incredient is cranberry sauce.

Out of this WORLD! I used a pork loin roast and whole berry cranberry sauce. The gravy had a wonderful hint of sweetness that made the mashed potatoes taste even better! Hubby and kids LOVED this, even my mother, a chef, loved it. So easy and so good. Cant wait to WOW them again with this one! Thank you for sharing!

Used sirloin tip roast and accidentally a 2 oz packet of onion soup mix. No matter - it was great anyway! Everyone liked the gravy ("this is zesty! yum!"), which I thickened with a tbsp of cornstarch mixed with water, after skimming off the fat. I also added about a cup of water to the slow cooker prior to cooking. I will make this again!

Very easy and very good.  I seared the roast first and used whole berry cranberry sauce (it's what I had on hand.) I cooked  it for 6 hours and it was perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon!

Very tasty - the sauce was a little sweet but that went well with the pork roast. A nice, fast main course with lots of flavour.

Absolutely fantastic.  I served it to friends who are normally picky eaters, and they loved it!  I used the cranberry sauce with whole cranberries, since that's what I had in the cupboard.  It still turned out great.  The cranberries cook down enough that they're not really noticeable.

This was a great meal.  My husband turned his nose up at the thoughts of it, though he changed his mind after the first bite.  I added sliced onions and used whole cranberry sauce in mine and it made a great easy dish!

I was a little nervous not adding any liquid to this recipe and leaving it on all day, but no need to worry.  My husband loved this; I felt it needed a little something flavor wise (maybe a second envelope of Onion Soup next time).

My son loed the gravy over mashed potatoes but hated the gravy over the meat, he said it made it to sweet. My husband LOVED it and I thought it was really good though I too, was hesitant to try it. The leftover meat made EXCELLENT sandwiches about 3 days later!

Absolutely wonderful!  I braised the roast before I put it into the slowcooker and also added some water (1/4 cup?) because I wasn't sure whether the cranberry sauce would be enough liquid.  The roast was juicy and delicious.  My husband said that it is even better than his mom's!

Yummy! I read all the reviews before making this. These are the changes I made-used 3.30 lb of chuck roast and added one can of beef broth. I turned off the crockpot at 6 hours and let the roast sit for about 1/2 hour. The addition of the beef broth mellowed the sweetness of the gravy. It is worth a try to make it. Easy and delish!

I made this last Sunday for company that night. However, it smelled so good cooking, and was done when we got home from church, that we ate it for lunch and made something else for dinner. I have to admit, I was quite cautious to try it. I was unsure of the combination of onion soup mix and cranberry sauce. Also, my husband does not care for cranberry anything, so I was trusting in other reviewers' saying the cranberry taste was minimal, which it was. We were thoroughly impressed, and even kept the remaining gravy around for a few days after the meat was gone. This gave the meat an excellent flavor, and was a great combination of sweet and savory that we just loved. Thanks so much for sharing!

Incredible flavor.  Used rump roast and served with nice light mashed red potatoes with the skins on (the gravy is so rich and flavorful you don't need much butter in the potatoes) and peas.  The best all-time Sunday dinner ever.  Used stick blender instead fo whisk for gravy.

This smelled amazing while it cooked all day in slow cooker. Super easy recipe. Hubby liked this more than I did, I  found it to be a little too sweet. Gravy was fantastic over both the roast and mashed potatoes.  Nice change though from traditional roast.

This was a huge hit!  It sounded like a weird combo, but I was in the mood to experiment so I used beef.  I made whole berry sauce and poured the hot sauce over the meat (2 c cranberries, 1 c water, 3/4 sugar boiled until berries pop and sauce thickens), which sped up the cooking time.  I added a little ground black pepper, then cooked on high for 1 1/2 hours and low for 4.  I cooked the roux on the stove top for about 5 minutes, then whisked in about 3/4 cup of the gravy to the roux before adding it back to the crock pot.  Very fork tender, and the gravy was excellent!  The cranberry flavor was a nice background note, but my non-cranberry eaters all loved it.

I used a pork roast and substituted in (1 tsp each) thyme, beef powder, paprika and (1/2 tsp each) salt and pepper for the onion soup mix as that's what I had on hand. Not wanting or needing to wait 8 hours, I cooked it for 4 on high, and it turned out brilliantly. It's pleasingly sweet and sour, the pork is tender, and like others have said, it produces a lot of juices, which I'm gonna attempt to make gravy with.

It was delicious! I made it per instructions, but did add some baby carrots. The carrots picked up a lot of the cranberry sweetness, which we didn't particularly like. I did halve the dry onion soup mix and cranberry sauce, to match the poundage of the meat we had. Six hours in the slow cooker had it fork tender. I am going to experiment next time: twice the amount of dry soup mix to half the amount of cranberry sauce. I think this change might make it more on the savory side.

I don't even like beef but this was delicious! I will say I am a sweet tooth and you can definitely taste a little sweetness in this. My husband isn't a sweet tooth and he thought it was fine but not amazing like I thought. The meat was tender and cooked perfectly. I added some carrots and potatoes the last 2  which ended up delicious. I added 1/4 cup of water when I added the veggies, along with a few squirts of ketchup and grape jelly (only did this because it looked like it needed more liquid).  Will definitely make again!

Made it exactly as written with a beef chuck roast.  It was cooked after 7 hours on low and was even better the next day.  Not too sweet and not too salty.  It was quite good.  Would recommend.

this a really great recipe. I've made it several times. You can actually use any kind of cheap beef roast and I've also used a pork roast as well. Not the butt though. A nice pork sirloin roast is a good one which is what I used.

We will definitely make this again.  I'm a vegetarian so I added celery, onions and carrots.  I served it with mashed garlic potatoes.  For the thickening I used corn starch and it made a great gracy.  My husband asked that this be "put into the rotation."

The roast was wonderful!  I added a cut up sweet potato for the last 3 hours and we loved that too.  The gravy is a little sweet, which we like, and goes great with mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe and it was great.  The sauce is sweet obviously which I liked rather than the typical savory sauce.  This was very easy.  I put it on in the morning, came back at dinner made some mashed potatoes.  It was a great meal.

The recipe did not mention water for the soup mix so  I added the full amount of water according to the soup mix directions.  This was a mistake.  At the end of cooking,  I had to boil off a lot of water to get the liquid to be more like a pre-gravy.  Still think maybe 1 cup is ok but between the meat and the jellied cranberry sauce, you get a lot of juices anyway.
This dish  was amazingly good.  A rich brown gravy with a little sweetness.  Even the meat itself had a little sweetness.  I used cornstarch instead of flour for thickening which I think is better.  Also, I put the meat over egg noodles and then the gravy overtop of everything and then served it.
Awesome dish and easy to make.  Definitely one of my keeper recipes.

I've made this a couple of times & prefer to use whole berry cranberry sauce over jellied, but that's just personal preference.  I didn't need to add water--it got plenty juicy on it's own!  I like to add peeled & cut potatoes & baby carrots the last 5 hours of cooking, and I thickened the gravy with 2 tbsp cornstarch & 2 tbsp water as others suggested.  Delicious!

Truly a dump and go crockpot recipe, perfect for a busy weekday.  So easy, so good.  Deeply flavorful without tasting noticeably of cranberry.  I use a boneless pork loin and serve the sauce over mashed potatoes.  This one is a family favorite.

This was seriously delicious!  I read the 5 star reviews, crossed my fingers and hoped it would turn out!  Kids raved about it which is always a plus.  I did lightly season the roast with pepper, garlic powder and a little thyme before topping with cranberry sauce.  I thickened the gravy with cornstarch/water mixture instead of butter/flour.  Wonderful--will make often!

Very good.  A little sweet so next time I think I will only use a half can of cranberry sauce and two envelopes of onion soup mix.  Meat was very tender.

This recipe was pretty tasty. I love slow cooker recipes with minimal prep, and this one is very easy and has only a few ingredients. I especially liked the gravy/sauce. The cranberry sauce is subtle and compliments the onion soup mix well.

It was ok. Kind of bland. I thought the cranberry gave it a weird sweetness. I won't make a roast with cranberry again.

Delicious! I actually used a boneless pork shoulder roast. I also added a can of whole berry cranberry sauce and then doubled the butter and flour at the end. Served with mashed potatoes. Even my kids loved it. I've added this to my list of faves for my crockpot.

I made the recipe with one substitution, I had a can of cranberry sauce with whole cranberries in the pantry already so I used that. The roast turned out great! Tender and with a slightly sweet flavor. The leftover meat was fantastic in barbque sauce the next night. 

But the "gravy" tasted very weird. Too sweet for me. It might be better with pork, but I doubt I'll try it again. Except to cook the roast in and then toss the "gravy". The meat, it was awesome!

It was ok as is.  It had an odd taste and smell to it.  After looking at some similar recipes on here, I added 1 cup Thousand Island dressing, 1 cup apricot preserves, 1/4 cup red wine, 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.  Then I cooked the sauce another 1/2 hour or so.  That made it taste a lot better, but I'm not sure I would make it again.

This is so fabulous, you can't define the cranberry sauce it just has a little bit of a sweet, beefy taste.  I was wondering if there should have been some liquid in it, but I made it just as directed and ended up with plenty of gravy.

We had this for Christmas Day.  It was excellent and easy to make so that I can play with the kids. The cranberry gave it enough sweetness and the gravy on top added the final touch.  It is a on our list to do again.

Meat was good for sandwiches thankfully the "gravy"/sauce which was gross did not permiate into the meat much -with all the toppings on a sandwich it was good. Sorry, this recipe was just not my taste.

This is one of my favorite ways to slow cook a a beef pot roast.  I like to use one can whole cranberry sauce and two envelopes of beefy onion soup mix.  To thicken the gravy I prefer just thickening with a slurry of water and corn starch.  Either way though is just fine.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm a complete amateur and this was the very first recipe I tried in my very first slow cooker. A TOTAL HIT! I made it for my parent and myself so there was enough for two nights of delight. Everyone wiped their plates clean and I was so thrilled with how easy it was. I just made some mashed potatoes and broccoli for the sides and it was perfect. I was especially happy that my Mom ate everything - she has trouble swallowing these days but the meat was so tender it was easy for her. I feel like I'm off to a wonderful start with the slow cooker now... thanks!

This was so easy to make and come home to.  I used whole berry cranberry sauce and just strained it real quick after reducing the sauce.  I also made steamed green beans and instant mashed potatos and it was awesome, my 5yr old even ate it and she is picky.

This is a MUCH quicker recipe then my normal go-to recipe.  The picky husband and teenagers were hesitant because of the cranberry sauce, but they absolutely loved it!  We did not think any one flavor overpowered another.  Followed the recipe exactly except for I had to use a 5lb roast.  Very good :)

SO EASY & SO DELICIOUS! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I put it in at 10am before going to visit family and it was like a gourmet meal waiting for us at home. I disagree about it tasting like BBQ or being too sweet- it was more of a gourmet flavor to me - like something you would get at a nice restaurant. Also easy to pass on to friends with so few ingredients to reemeber.

It was my first pot roast ever and it turned out very nice! I brought it to potluck dinner and it was gone completely. Mine was not too sweet, but just right. I used the whole cranberries sauce, and I used Israeli (Osem)  onion soup mix. I believe this one can be more salty than others. I used some reviews here and 4 hours before end of cooking I added some baby carrots and potatoes and sprinkle a little bit onion soup on the top. I had to take it out 30 min earlier due to the dinner time, and I wish I hold it in for the full 8 hours.  Thank you! Loved it, will do again

I added homemade cranberry sauce along with the jellied cranberry sauce.  I like this recipe and my family loved it however I still did not think that it was very cranberry tasting.  But overall the meat was super tender and moist.

I did exactly what the recipe called for and it lacked flavor. My entire family asked if I forgot the salt, and we don't usually use salt. I found it bland and would add some salt, and pepper next time. We were disappointed with the flavor, but the roast was tender and juicy.

Very easy to make and taste great. The recipe says to mix butter and flour together then to add to sauce but that wouldn't work so I just added it to the crock pot then let the butter melt while I mixed it up.

This is pretty good, and very easy.  My fifteen year old made it for the family and the sitter when my husband and I were out of town, and it was a big hit with them.  My husband thinks it's too sweet, but it's tender and juicy, and we'll make it again and again.  I've used it with pork roast, but the kids made it with stew beef and served it over noodles.

My family loved this roast.  The gravy was delicious made from the juices and cranberry sauce.  I think next time I will try it with whole cranberry sauce, rather than the jelly kind.  I will definitely make this again.

This was good but not great.  I might make it again but won't run out to buy the ingredients or crave it.  It was VERY easy and cooked up nice.  I cooked it on low for about 7 hours then turned it down to warm until we were ready to eat.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars not only because everyone in my house LOVED it, but also because it was so incredibly easy.  I just threw it in the crock pot that morning, and it was ready to go for dinner that night. In fact, instead of following that last few directions, I just shredded the meat in the crock pot and let it soak up most of the juices, and then I served it over rice - fantastic!  Even easier!

This is so easy and it tasted wonderful. When we came home the whole house smelled great. I thickened some of the "gravy" and served it over cheesy mashed potatoes and it was a a wonderful meal.

I'm giving it 3 stars because I would give it 4 but my husband only gave it 2 and that was stretching it.  He felt that it was too sweet and hardly ate any.  I didn't find it sweet but then I love sweets.  So, I guess won't be making it again.

Really sweet in taste!  I liked it, but would have liked to add something to make it not so sweet.  Maybe  some wine?  I took half the gravy being that it was so sweet and added it to egg noodles along with some mushrooms.  This dish isn't very colorful. I would try it again, but might make some changes.

This was the most tasty pork roast we've had in a long time!!!  The gravy was awesome over mashed potatoes!  Would most definitely have it again.  It was done in about 6 1/2 hours.

This recipe was tasty.  The beef melted in your mouth, but there was nothing special about it.  I was disappointed that the cranberry sauce didn't give it more of a unique flavor.

This was delicious.  I started it a bit late and cooked it mostly on High on the slow cooker - it still was absolutely fabulous.  The meat was so tender!  The family raved.  I will definitely cook this easy dish again and again.  It took seconds to prepare!

The meat came out very dry and tough. I also didn't like the sweetness of the gravy. It did make a ton of gravy. I think I will stick to the "Awesome Slow Cooker Roast" recipe also on this site.

This really isn't worth what you spend on the meat!  I'm giving it two stars instead of one because my husband actually liked it.  My two-year old (who is definitely NOT a picky eater) didn't care for it, and neither did I.  I followed the advice about altering the cooking time, and agree that it should be about 6 1/2 to 7 hours.  We just didn't care for the taste.

This is awesome!  Only cooked for about 6 hours on low, then took out roast, cut it, made gravy and put the roast back in the crockpot.  Kept on warm for an hour or so before we ate.  Other then cooking time, I followed directions to the T.  YUM!

I'm not usually a gravy fan, but this stuff was good! I cooked a 3 1/2 lb. roast for 2 1/2 on high and 2 1/2 on low and it was just a tad bit too done, but still so yummy. My four year old even asked for more gravy on his meat and mashed potatoes! A keeper for sure.

This roast was easy to make, but I was the only one who liked it. It was to sweet for my husband and my son who loves cranberries didn't like it at all. I don't know if I would make it again.

Thank you Atlanta Kim for this recipe.  It was so easy and so delicious.  The gravy was so good due to the jellied cranberry.  i will definetely make this again and again for years to come.  I made this with Spaetzle and the gravy was wonderful over the Spaetzle as well as the roast!

This was awesome!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Funny thing was that my husband, who hardly likes pot roast and hates cranberry sauce, said it was the best roast ever.  Not dry at all.  I cooked mine on low for 10 hours and it was perfectly moist without falling apart.  Kids loved it, husband loved it - IT'S A KEEPER!!

I had to give this one just three stars, although the flavor was good. My problem was that some of the meat got burned. I followed the directions to a "T", but my meat was overcooked. Since it was overdone, the meat just fell apart, so I shredded the meat and served it with the sauce. My family liked the flavor despite it being well done. I will make this again, but next time cook it for a much shorter time.

I made the roast exactly as stated, but just cooked it for 7 hours.. which was plenty of time.  I took it out, sliced it, then put back in the slow cooker (once I had made the gravy)and kept on warm until it was time for dinner.    My family LOVED it!    The gravy is excellent on mashed potatoes as many have already suggested.   This is easy and wonderful - would be good for the holidays, too.

Great recipe.  Set up the crockpot, go to work, come back 8 hours later to an absolutely fantastic meal.  My wife now requests this dish if I havn't made it in awhile.

Good!  I didn’t change a thing, made it exactly as is. A little on the sweet side so it depends on what your looking for.  The drippings made very nice gravy.

It was good, but not the best roast I've ever had. Definitely eat it with mashed potatoes though.

This was the best pot roast ever. I added carrots, onion, and potatoes 30 mins before it was done and I was awsome. Everyone was fighting over the leftovers the next day.

I thought it was good. I used a pork tenderloin but I think a chuck would be good too.I also used 3/4 cup of apple juice and added carrots. Yams would have been good too Eventhough I gave this 3 stars I give it 5 for how easy it is. Its great to make when you don't hve time. I made rice to go with it.
            thanks

I am sorry, I did not like it at all. Alot of it could have been the type of roast I used, chuck, I could not eat it. The rest of the family said it was really good, but no one went back for seconds. Sorry

Excellent!  I added about a third cup of water to the onion soup mix and put some minced garlic and chopped onion on top of the roast before topping it with the cranberry.  It was incredibly easy to put together and tasted great!

We tried this last night and it  was amazing!  I had a beef tenderloin roast, but wanted an easy recipe.  This was perfect.  The only thing I did differently was use whole cranberry sauce, which made the gravy more of a thick sauce.  We also stopped cooking after 5 1/2 hours and the roast was a beautiful pink in the middle (medium on the doneness scale.)  Great recipe and sooo easy!!

This couldn't be easier or tastier.  I used pork roast and there was plenty of liquid as it cooked.  Paired it with mashed potatoes and green salad, but next time may serve broccoli or another green vegetable with it to balance the sweetness of the sauce.  Whole family enjoyed it--Kids and adults.  Easy menu for days when running kids to sporting events.

Wouldn't change a thing!!!!  Replaces all past ways of making this - threw potatoes and carrots and everything was AWESOME.  Was concerned about the amount of water in the begining but it was plenty of gravy!

The cranberry sauce just didn't do it for me... Beef and cranberries just don't go together for my taste buds... It wasn't bad but just not what I expected.

Absolutely delicious! When I saw cranberry sauce as an ingredient I was a bit skeptical but after reading all the reviews and the 5 star rating I figured it had to be good. It's even better than I expected. The flavor of the sauce is amazing. The only thing I would do differently is get a better cut of meat just because I like softer cuts. And just as a helpful hint my crock pot tends to cook faster than the recommended time so I tested for doneness with a meat probe. I feel overcooking even in a slow cooker can make meat a bit dry. I cooked this meal in less time than the recipe recommends and it was perfect.
