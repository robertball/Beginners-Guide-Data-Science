Very easy to prepare. A little plain as is though. I added some cayenne pepper to taste and diced jalapenos. I also added 1/4 cup black beans in addition to the corn for extra color. I did make them using canned chicken because that's what I had - wouldn't recommend it. Taste wise would be great with grilled and shredded chicken that marinades in a salsa :) j

Easy to make but disappointed.  Corn made it horrible like finding sand in your salad.  Don't recommend.  Everyone tried one, but found rest in napkins in the trash.

Quick and easy. I flavored the chicken with garlic powder and paprika before I cooked it. I added black beans too. Next time, I will throw in some red onions and fresh tomatoes.

This was a good base recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to cut up my chicken and fry it with three cloves of garlic.  My boyfriend then added salt, pepper, and a little red pepper for flavoring.  When that was done cooking, I mashed the avocado up with the chicken and added the salsa.  It was really yummy and we both enjoyed it.  I added a little fresh tomato to mine as well as some lettuce.   All and all this was a really quick and easy recipe to make.  I will make it again.

The flavor on these is amazing, but they are kind of hard to keep together when you roll them.  I might try more avacado next time and see if that makes a difference.

After reading all the reviews, I changed this recipe a bit.  I melted a bit of blue cheese with sweet baby rays bbq sauce and then added an equal amount of ranch dressing to make the sauce. I also added red onion and tomato to the chicken mixture.  It went over very well and even made a good lunch the next day wrapped in lettuce.

These were good. I cheated and used precooked and sliced chicken fajita meat and just diced it a little smaller. I used the salsa instead of BBQ sauce and I added black beans. Tasted really good but I had trouble keeping the rolls together - I squished them really close together on the plate so they held each other together until people started eating them and they all started to fall apart. I think I could have used more smashed avocado as a glue but I ran out.

It's 2:50 AM and I started my review at 2:15 and just as a finished it lost the page!!! But amazingly no bad words passed threw my mouth.  HALLELU-YAH!   So hear again I start my review. This recipe sounds great but it didn't mention my favorite herb...CILANTRO!!!! (you can find it in the produce department near the parsley)  I use it in almost every dish. If you haven't tried it yet here are some (what I think)are some terrific places places to use it. green salads, eggs, fruit salads and certainly this yummy wrap recipe.  What I also use on my fruit salad is something called"Cajin fruit seasoning".  If you can't find it, you can use any creole seasoning or chille powder. Here's also a little hint to save you some penny's. When you need to buy corrindro, tumeric, chilli powder, garlic etc. go to the International section.  Go to the foods from India and the Oriential products. The quality is better and they are much less expensive. Well, that's about all for now, hoping that this information helps and that it can enhance your cooking experience. Happy Cooking, IleneFaith.

Pretty decent, definitely a simple recipe.  Folks really liked it- I used the BBQ sauce, not the salsa.  It would probably be much better with salsa.

not bad. I made them with mild salsa. They are still lacking a little something to make them pop....I think I will try adding a little jalepeno and cilantro next time. As noted in previous reviews they don't hold together nicely when sliced. I did better with making them as a burrito type thing for lunch and NOT slicing them. And avacado turns when it sits out so I think guacamole with the acid/lime in it would add both flavor and keep it prettier looking. So...good place to start but needs some tweaking.

This was delicious but messy, and hard to get the wraps to keep their shape. I used 1/2 cup black bean and corn salsa, added 1/3 cup black beans and then served it as a dip with tortilla chips the second time around. Everyone loved it.

My son, who doesn't eat anything, loves this.  Don't make it with the BBQ sauce.  You can add a can of rinsed and drained black beans.

Made with BBQ sauce and used prepared guacamole the second time instead of just avacado at the request of my family.  We will have this periodically as everyone likes it, even the baby.

Looking for a healthy quick lunch for the kids and I. 12 and 10 yr. old liked, 8 not so much. I thought it was okay. I used 1/2 bbq and 1/2 ranch as per kid's request. Needs more avacado if you're making 4. There is not enough "meat" in one to put 3 tbs. on each tortilla. Will do again and experiment w/ different  sauces. Used sliced, packaged deli chicken. Very easy, not bad. Chopped grilled would be better.

These tasted really good. I used leftover shredded and seasoned chicken, added a can of black beans, added a little bit of leftover shredded cheese and used salsa instead of bbq. The only problem was they were hard to slice and keep together. Took them to a work function and everyone loved them. I think a few people were put off by the avacado getting dark once they sat out for a little while. As a whole, they were enjoyed and fairly easy to make. Will probably make again.

I made this a huge hit in our house by adding a light ranch dressing and BBQ sauce. i also sprinkled a little Bacon Salt over the mixture before I rolled them. Very very good!
