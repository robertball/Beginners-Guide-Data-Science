This was really easy!! Yay!! I was nervous because this was my first souffle. I doubled the recipe with the exception of the eggs. (I only used one extra because I ran out. It still worked.) The only thing I would add is more asparagus than called for. I will most definitely cook this again.

This is delicious! I modified it as follows: instead of adding the pinch of cayenne, i added two teaspoons of hot curry powder and i used a whole clove of garlic.... the flavor was incredible and will def make it again!

My friend made this for Xmas dinner last night.  It was delicious!!  The texture is really light and a nice compliment to the heavy meat also we had.  She served with red beets and the colors were beautifully festive!!  The left overs i got to take home are still delicious.  I'm going to try to make this at home.  Thank you!!

This was fantastic - I placed phyllo dough squares in a muffin pan and then poured souffle in the cups - made for an awesome looking veg dish that was delicious.

I am very much a beginner cook, just retired husband. This will be one of my keeper recipes though. Used broccoli instead of asparagus, put way too much in, added extra cheese, didn't have ramikens so used a big casserole dish....it still worked out! Had to cook twice as long, but hey - understandable. Very good and easy recipe.

Delicious and looked great too! Definitely 5 stars.
My eight year old son was a bit afraid of the green color, but the rest of us (including his younger brother) thought it was cool!

This was delicious and not at all difficult! My husband is crazy and doesn't like asparagus, so I used thawed frozen spinach and artichoke hearts with a bit of garlic, and blended the mixture with sandwich slices of Swiss cheese because that was the only cheese I had, and it turned out BEAUTIFULLY. Can't wait to try this with all kinds of other veggies!

Absolutely awesome!  I changed nothing except subbing white pepper for the cayenne (didn't have any).  One caveat - it makes SIX ramekins, not four - if you watch the video Chef John makes four, but says that it will make six and he is reserving the rest of the mixture for another purpose.  I never would have thought that garlic and cheese would work well with asparagus this way, but it was excellent!

After reading this recipe, I went to the store, bought the ingredients, and made it the same day.  My husband and I loved it.  I modified the recipe slightly with more garlic (two cloves which was a little too much even for us garlic lovers)and half whipping cream and half milk.  I think I would have liked a little more salt.  Also, this is a great, elegant side dish for a company meal.

Based on some review comments about a lack of flavor, I used a combination of White Cheddar Cheese and Asiago cheese. I also added 1/4 tsp of dried basil and some freshly ground black pepper.  An immersion blender worked well to puree the asparagus and milk/egg mixture.

First soufflé ever.  Turned out perfect and everyone loved it. I didn’t have ramikins so used soup mugs without a problem. Will definitely make again.

Looked fancy and tasted great...They were easy to prepare, I prepared them early and let them sit for a few hours...put them in the oven and they were still puffy and tasty!

It seemed like a lot of work to get the end result. The butter/flour mixture took way longer than projected. The end dishes rose nicely but, dropped within 3 minutes. My advice is to eat them right away. Rewarming doesn't work well either. The top seemed to be where the cheese rose in the dish and was a little tough in my opinion. Check for a simpler recipe or dumb this one down to; 1) Cook the asparagus/spinach 2) Mix in some chopped onion, mayo and cheese 3) Whip and fold in egg whites 4) Bake it for 20-25 mins @ 350 deg F. I think you get there faster and as good.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe, and it always turns out beautifully! I've baked this in a baking dish (adjusting for time) as a casserole, and in individual ramekins. Either way, it's light, and fluffy, and oh-so-yummy!

Not sure what happened, we've made souffles before. But this one fell drastically, and the texture wasn't right - kind of mushy. We tried baking one longer but that didn't firm it up. The flavor wasn't good either - very bland, should have added salt and more garlic. The egg and asparagus didn't complement each other at all. Won't try this again.

I really enjoyed making this side dish.  It was fairly simple and was something a bit different for my crew!  I think spinach would be good as well.

The only change I made to this yummy dish was to double it.  I am giving 5 stars based on my great Aunt's review which was that I should be on a cooking show with it!  She loved it, my daughter was going to taste it and ate the whole thing.  Very easy to make, I watched the video as this is the first souffle I have ever made and that really helped.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

these were just ok but for all the work they involved it was a waste of time.  Very little flavor.  My wife and kid didn't like them and they like almost anything I make.  I ate what they didn't as I hate to waste food but again it was just not very flavorful.

I made it with Lactose Free - fat free milk but added 1/4 cup liquid coffee creamer, used regular Swiss cheese. My husband is lactose intolerant so I have to modify the recipes. None the less, we enjoyed it very much!

I liked it & so did others, but man it seemed like I pulled out ever pot, pan & bowl to get this one done. Since I did it all in one round corning ware dish it needed to cook what seemed like a lot longer to firm up. Never made soufflé now I can say I have.

This is a easy souffle. I used 4- 6oz ramekins and a small Corning-ware dish. Souffles seem to scare most people, but with a bit of patience, they come out great.

So good -- and easy! Light, fluffy, and yummy.  My only variant is that I used an 8" round baking dish versus baking it in individual ramekins.

4 stars because I changed it up a bit.  I used spinach and some chopped cauliflower (husband doesn't like asparagus), didn't use the blender, and made in an 8" square baking dish.  That meant that it didn't "rise" like a normal souffle, but still the proportions and timing worked well.  I've made similar ones just with spinach; this one got raves from my husband.  Thanks Chef John, always good recipes from you!

I made this with 4 big handfuls of spinach leaves. I added 1 clove of garlic, and it didn't over-power the dish. Made more like 6 servings. Special presentation, though the soufflés started to fall almost immediately after removing from the oven. Have to serve immediately for best presentation!

I love chef John's recipes, so it is hard for me to critizice him, but this soufflé had a very unappealing texture. When I took out of the oven it looked exactly like his in the video, so I was very excited...Not sure if I did something wrong, but I will not try it again to find out.
