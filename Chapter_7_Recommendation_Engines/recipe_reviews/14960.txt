Great recipe - badly organized. My suggestion:
1. Prepare potatoes and green beans for cooking.
2. Peel and slice garlic and chop onions.
3. In a heavy skillet, heat oil over medium low heat and add garlic & onion. Saute until golden and crisp over low heat. Add butter & heat until melted.
5. While garlic/onion is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender. Avoid overcooking. Drain and set aside.
6. Microwave or steam string beans 'til tender but still crisp. Set aside.
7. Cook pasta in boiling water; check at 10 minutes for al dente. Drain and coat with pesto if desired.
8. Add potatoes, green beans and pasta to garlic/onion mixture.
Add Parmesan and gently toss. S&P to taste & serve. Yum.

Unusual combination of flavours that really taste great.  The Parmesan cheese tops it off nicely.

While this recipe requires a few pots and pans, it is out of this world!  I would never have guessed the combo of potatoes, beans, and pasta could ever taste so wonderful.  This has gone into my recipe box!

This is ok, but I don't know what the big fuss is. It's basically just beans, potato and noodles together. There isn't even any sauce. Not recommended.

This was really very good.  At first I thought the bean/potato/pasta combo would be a little strange, but it really surprised me.

I can see why Sophia likes this so much. Blanched fresh green beans for 3 minutes. Boiled snall,new potatoes for 6 minutes while onion sauted in butter till golden, then added a bucketful of garlic. Used whole wheat penne instead. What an wonderful blend of flavors!

It was a little oily...  from all of the butter and olive oil.  It might have been more for me because I used baby red potatoes instead of whole, which could have eaten up some grease.  I will definitely make this again but use only the olive oil.  We make a lot of pasta dishes and we did love this one a lot.  Good flavor especially with all of the yummy garlic!
