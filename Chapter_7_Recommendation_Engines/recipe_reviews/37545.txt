Yukh! Horrible. I think I'm the kind of guy who can eat anything, but these weren't good at all. I think the most similar taste to these brownies is flour taste. If I hadn't cooked them by myself, I couldn't have guessed that they were supposed to taste PB, and the jam taste was surely overwhelming. Don't even want to give it another try... Waste of time and ingredients!

These are FABULOUS!!  At first, everyone was like "what are they", but one taste and your hooked.  I highly recommend them.

Oh my gosh, these are to die for.  They're so dense, moist, and chewy, and the chocolate chunks just add the perfect touch.  I just finished eating one and the taste is still in my mouth...it's sooooo good!  I have to admit, they looked a bit scary after I swirled them and before I put them in the oven, but they came out perfect.  I used raspberry jam and cut up Lindt 70% chocolate bars and it's just divine.  I also used smooth PB because that was all I had.  I had to bake mine 45 minutes, and that's in my convection oven, so the baking time was a bit off, but heck, when they come out this good...who cares!!!

I thought these were good but I ended up throwing out the last couple of bars  because nobody ever finished them. Not sure if I would make again.

These took forever to bake and were really just gross. Hubby thought they were terrible, and I agree.  And chocolate, peanut butter and jam are three of my favorite foods. Awful.
