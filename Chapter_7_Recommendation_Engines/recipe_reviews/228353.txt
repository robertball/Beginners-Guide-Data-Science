Orangeade takes me back to my childhood and a hot dog restaurant in downtown Cincinnati that served the best orangeade ever.  I made half a recipe but thought the orange flavor was just a little too diluted.  I added the juice from another two oranges which brought the right balance between the water and the orange flavor.  I thought this recipe was a little sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar.  I definitely will make again and maybe even try Splenda to reduce the calories.  Nice change from all the lemonade, limeade, ice tea that I drink in summer.  Whatever happened to restaurants serving orangeade???

I had a lot of fresh oranges, and this was a good way to use then other than just juice. I did double the orange juice, and added more lemon to taste. Very refreshing drink.

I didn't really care for the final result, but my husband thought it was great.  He said that it could have relied more on the orange flavor.  I will definitely make this again, possibly with the addition of more orange juice.

I appreciate lutzflcat's advice to add two more oranges and less sugar because it gave a 4 star recipe a 5 star rating boost!! Thank you for the wonderful idea of orangeade as a refreshing alternative to standard summertime beverages, couldbeanyone!! Yum!!

My husband had some orangeade at a local restaurant and asked me to make some. I initially made this recipe as written (a 4-star recipe) and thought the orange flavor was on the weak side, as others mentioned. I added the juice of 2 additional oranges as suggested by others and refrigerated it overnight. My husband tried it the next morning and thought it was perfect.

1 1/2 cups of sugar sounded like a lot so I made it with only one cup of sugar.  It still came out way too sweet.  I should have used half a cup or less.

Like other reviewers, I had to add more orange juice to get a better flavor. I did cheat and use Tropicana orange juice, since I had a huge 89 oz. container in the fridge and I was making a large quantity for my son's class party. I did squeeze lemons to get the lemon juice, though. Super easy recipe! I didn't find it too sweet with the original 1.5 C of sugar.

I followed the popular opinion of too much sugar and not enough orange flavor. So with that in mind, I increased the fresh squeezed orange juice to 2 cups, and I used 1 large juicy home grown lemon, I decreased the sugar amount to 1 cup, I did add about 1 extra cup of cold water. That was the right mix based on my personal taste.  I love orange ade, and I haven't had it since I was a kid.  Brought back great memories of my grandmother, and the occasional time my mom would make it.  Something I will be drinking frequently.

I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed it as written. It's delicious! Reminiscent of a fat food chains orangeade that Andy and I used to visit on the east coast. ?? The lemon adds another citrus note and helps cut the sweetness a bit. Delicious!

After reading the other reviews, I reduced the simple syrup mixture to 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also reduced the water to 4 cups.  It came out perfect!  Such a delicious way to use up the extra oranges on my counter!

Came out great, you may want to reduce amount of sugar, super sweet! Mixes well with vodka for a high octane screwdriver :-)
