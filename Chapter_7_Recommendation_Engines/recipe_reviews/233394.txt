I submitted this recipe and wanted to pass along some info and tips. You can cook the orzo a few days in advance. Just drizzle the cooked orzo with just enough vegetable oil to very lightly coat it, to keep it from sticking, cover and refrigerate. Or make it even farther ahead and freeze until needed. Likewise with the wild rice, cover and refrigerate or freeze – no tossing in oil is needed for the rice. The nuts can be toasted several days in advance; cool and store in an airtight container. Dried cranberries or raisins can easily be substituted for the currants. And leftovers are quite good, but the nuts will have lost some of their crunch. If you make this I hope you enjoy it.

Fantabulous stuff! I love wild rice and orzo, and the dressing is da bomb! It's one of those dishes I just want to eat and eat and eat. I did have to make some subs, dried cranberries instead of currants (currants are yummy though), walnuts instead of pecans (it was still good), and red wine vinegar instead of white. That being said, the taste was just a little different using the red instead of white vinegar and it did color the rice and orzo darker. I'll have to buy white wine vinegar now. I did add a lot more wild rice than calls for, just my preference. The dressing is what makes this salad in my opinion. You can add in or take out from the salad part too, but the dressing is just ummmmmmmm. Thanks Belle!!

I have been making this quite often since Bellepepper brought it to the Buckeye Bash a few years ago. It is one of my favorite "go-to" salads for a BBQ with company (it also travels well)! I have never changed anything except to use dried cranberries instead of currants.  It is very easy to assemble if you heed Bellepepper's suggestion to cook the orzo and wild rice ahead of time (toss the cooked orzo lightly in veg. or olive oil), freeze, and toast the nuts a few days before. I assemble the day before entertaining but save the nuts and parsley to add just before serving. Serve this and I promise someone will ask you for the recipe! Thanks, BP, great recipe!

Very interesting salad.  We loved The blend if flavors and textures. However, it was much too sweet for our tastes. I'll definitely make again, but halve the sugar. I brought it to a party and got many compliments though.  I just thought the sweet dressing along with the dried cranberries (couldn't  find currants) was a little much.  If you like your dressing on the sweet side, it may be a 5 star for you!

Review originally posted July 2011 when the recipe was still a personal recipe: This salad is going on our family favourites list! I made the rice and orzo ahead of time then tossed everything but the nuts and parsley together a few hours before serving. Everyone then added the nuts and parsley to their individual servings because of personal tastes. I thought there would be lots left over but the salad was soooo good that there was barely enough for a serving for lunch for one. It is a great recipe for my vegetarian daughter. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Bellepepper!          Update  June  9 2014-  I've made this numerous times and always get requests for the recipe!

This was a great salad.  I hate cooking orzo, so maybe I will try something else next time.  I didn't have any white pepper or currants, so used dried cranberries and just went without the white pepper.  It was not missed.

Good and different. I didn't use the wild rice the first time.  It was too expensive for an experiment.  It was good without it.

Bellepepper, this recipe is worthy of 5 stars. I am a major tweaker, but I made it exact, even the sugar amount was bang on! The currants add a nice subtle, sweet taste. Since currants are so tiny, I would follow the advice from linda2d-if subbing raisins or craisins, chop them first. The texture was fantastic, I would sprinkle the nuts on at the end if making in advance. Wild rice and orzo were 2 new ingredients added to my pantry, this is a very economical, fresh idea for a salad for future potlucks and family gatherings. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a bbq because my husband wanted me to try something different. This was fabulous. So many different flavors. I had to use craisins instead of currants because I couldn’t find them in my grocery store. I also used walnuts instead of pecans and almonds because I had walnuts in my pantry. Awesome recipe that I will make again for sure.

I have made this recipe several times and always double it.  It is quite versatile. I substitute the currents for raisins and often vary the types of nuts, depending what I have on hand.  If I do not have fresh basil, I use dried. If I do not have frozen corn I use canned.  One time I substituted white rice for the orzo to make it gluten free for my daughter. Next time I will add diced green apples.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a fantastic salad!  The flavor combination is fresh and delicious!  I made this salad a day in advance, adding the toasted nuts right before serving.  Lovely, unique side dish, bellepepper!  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was delicious!  Seeing that I only had a few of the ingredients on hand, I found it to be a hair labor intensive but it was well worth it in the end.  I will probably double the recipe next time so I don't have to cook teeny tiny portions of rice and orzo.  It's so yummy, I know my family will eat it up!  (Side note: I subbed chopped dates for the currants.)

This is a great orzo salad.   I also first had this orzo at a restaurant in Memphis .  My husband and I would study the salad to figure the ingredients every time we  ate it.  I think  We had all the ingredients  but not sure about proportions or the dressing. Thank you, Bellpepper for giving them to me.I do add one other ingredient which adds a really nice layer of flavor and that is FRESH MINT. Try it! We think the restuarant had mint in theirs.

Just made this recipe. It is delicious. I did not need all the salad dressing. I will save the remainder in case the leftovers get a little dry.

Wow, what a salad! it does require a lot of prep and time, but it's really worth it. I used craisins instead of currants and it was great. The dressing is sweet, I think next time I'll cut the sugar in half and see where it is. amazingly delicious salad, thank you!

I've made this for several parties and now when I ask "what can I bring?", my friends' response is "that awesome rice salad!" My hubs loves it too, so I make a big batch and keep some home for him. Great with grilled chicken. I have substituted quinoa, in place of the pasta or rice, and it's a nice change occasionally, but the original recipe is the bomb! Thanks!

I commute to work this was a easy 30 min meal. From the 3 bites I had to tastw it was very tasty & flavorful. I am excited for my lunch tomorrow. I added 1/4 cup of carrots & left over diced chicken. I used white vinegar & walnuts. I thought it was going to serve two or be small nope it made enough for a few days.

Bellepepper, I commend you for how well you've copied this dish. I, too, enjoy eating it at that well-known restaurant, and have re-created it myself. I've used your recipe to get the dressing just right. You're right, it's time consuming to do all that chopping, but it is well worth the effort!

i liked this salad despite the mistake i made.  i accidentally opened a can of artichokes instead of a can of wild rice.  i added it anyway.  i like to review these recipes as written; i think that is only fair to the author.  i originally thought it was a little sweet, but after sitting overnite the flavor was much better.  everyone loved it.

Love it. Suggest using 1 c wild rice. I actually used a grain blend called Soo Foo, which is a little peppery so I skipped the pepper. Used champagne vinegar because I had no white balsalmic. Very yummy!
