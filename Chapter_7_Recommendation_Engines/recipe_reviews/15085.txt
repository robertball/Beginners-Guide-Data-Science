I usually don't rate recipes if I alter them, but I am going to for this one. I will give it three stars but had the recipe been as I altered it, I would have given it five stars. I sauteed finely chopped mushrooms, red peppers, green and yellow onions and garlic. I also added spinach to the mixture. I loved the cream cheese part although I was worried it would be weird. It was really great. I topped it with mozzerella, parmasan and oregano for some color. After all that, it was the best chicken lasagna ever! :o) This is a good starting recipe to 'tweak' to your own liking.

I was looking for a lasagna recipe that didn't use ricotta cheese (my brother refuses to eat it.) He absolutely loved this dish.  It is a nice change from regular lasagna.  The only thing I did differently was added some garlic powder, pepper and Italian seasoning to the cream cheese mixture, and also used oven ready pasta to cut down on cooking time.  If you do try the oven ready pasta be sure to cover it with foil for the majority of cooking time, then for the last 10 minutes or so uncover to let the cheese get golden brown.

This was the GREATEST!!! Thank you so much.. I do have to give a warning though... a 9x13 pan is too big for this dish. Use the next size smaller for a BEAUTIFUL, full lasagna. It is sooo good and sooo rich! A dinner guest couldn't beleive that there was no ricotta in it. Thank you again!!!

Wonderful recipe! I poached frozen chicken breasts with chopped vidalia onion, celery tops, bay leaves, seasoned salt, and cracked black pepper for about two hours on a low simmer. I then shredded the cooked, cooled chicken, and in another pan sauteed one more chopped vidalia onion with two chopped, sweet, red bell peppers, two red chili peppers, oregano, and two cloves of garlic minced in a little olive oil. I added this mixture to the chicken, tossed in enough of the spaghetti sauce to lightly moisten the mixture, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Everyone loved this, and I had to send leftovers home with my daughter and son-in-law (I made mine in a 13 x 9 pan with nine lasagna noodles.) This recipe is OUTSTANDING! Thank you for sharing it.

This is definitely the best lasagna recipe I have ever made.  My husband loved it so much he asked to take the leftovers to work for lunch, something he rarely does.  Following the advice of others, I added sautéed onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, and spinach to the chicken/cheese mixture.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and a mix of regular and non-fat mozzarella to lighten it up a bit.  I baked it in a 7”x10” deep dish baker, and it turned out perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is really good.  I took the leftovers to work and all wanted the recipe.  I added a box of frozen spinach, but with or without that it is really good and easy to make.  I tried the "don't boil the noodles" method and it worked quite well.

This is an excellent recipe - almost enough to make me throw out my recipe for lasagna with beef!  Very rich and very creamy, a subtle but refreshing change from recipes including ricotta.  Another good feature, in my opinion, is the exclusion of eggs.  The only change I made was the addition of some oregano and some Italian seasoning, and I used the oven-ready lasagna noodles in order to skip a step.  This is the simplest and most delicious lasagna recipe I've tried.  A winner!

2/03 Good.  K (4 yrs) liked.  I used 2c leftover chicken & made my own sauce (15oz tomato sauce, 1c crushed tomatoes, 2 1/2tsp sugar, 1/2tsp basil, 1/4t oregano & 1tsp salt).  I added an egg to the sauce for binding.  Topped with the 1c mozzarella mixed with 1/2c fresh parmesan.  (By the way, 1/4 of a 12 ounce box of lasagna noodles is 6).  I try to reduce sugar whenever I can soooo - just a little 411 ;) - Ragu has 6g sugar per 1/2c, Tomato sauce as 4g per 1/2c.  Also, more 411 :), name brand (I forget which brand) is substantially more salty than the store brand.  I made my usual sauce & it turned out salty with the name brand.  Surprised me.

I hesitantly used No Fat cream cheese in this recipe and held my breath...fortunately, it was great!  Very rich, no weird flavor.  I also used cut-up grilled chicken and Barilla rotini.  Not quite lasagna (but it DOES taste like it!), just mixed everything together in a casserole.  Very good!

This is just like how my grandmother used to make her chicken lasagna, minus any vegetables in the sauce, and even that was homemade. As a student who is always on the roll, I was looking for something just as easy yet close to duplicating, and I've found the one. It fed me for about a week in leftovers, and was still good the next day. Serve with some garlic bread and you're good to go.

I love this recipe w/tweaking.  Prepared this for a potluck at work and my co-workers raved.  It does need tweaking w/seasonings to taste, and definitely needs more than a total of 6 noodles in a 9x13.  I DOUBLED the cheeses and 2 jars of sauce.  added a pkg. of frozen spinach to the cream cheese mixture, and didn't bother w/the bouillon.  Poached the chicken w/herbs and used 4 breasts in the double recipe and it was plenty. Used a 5 cheese blend shredded, as well as the uncooked noodles to save time. Love the flavors. will make again.

Yuuummmy!!! I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 only used 5oz cream cheese. I also threw in 1c ricotta, some italian spices, and fresh mozzarella. I poached frozen chicken breast in onion, bell pepper and seasonings. I did layer it differently but only because I used "oven ready" lasagna noodles which worked out perfect! Served this with Sweet Green Bean Bundles also on this site. I hope this is helpful (I know its a few changes) just know that this recipe is 5-star worthy! My guests raved!

Amazing...with a few modifications.  Seasoned Chicken w/italian herbs.  Added parmesan, fresh basil and spinach to the cream cheese mixture.  Used homemade spaghetti sauce.  The rich cream flavor is restaurant quality!

I really loved this recipe. It was easy and the cream cheese made it special. I didn't have time to cook the chicken breast so I used two 12 oz cans of cooked chicken breast. It still turned out great. Definitely a favorite!

Love this recipe! I cook my chicken in a crock pot for 4-6 hours, seasoned with a bit of seasoned salt, italian seasoning and garlic powder with 1/2 cup water before shredding and it comes out awesome!

It was really delicious!  Several things that I would change next time:
1) I would double the cheese mixture.  In this last batch I used 8 oz of cream cheese AND 8 oz of ricotta and it still wasn't enough.
2) I wouldn't use that much spaghetti sauce.  (side note: I made my own using tomato sauce, rotel, basil, cayenne pepper, and garlic salt to taste).
3) I added double the amount of bouillon for more flavor.
The cream cheese made it so creamy. This will be on our monthly rotation!

This recipe was fantastic!  However, I found that there was not enough cream cheese filling, the tomato sauce overpowered it somewhat.  I doubled the chicken mixture and it was twice as good.

I don't care for Lasagna... let's get that out of the way, but this recipe is amazing and has gotten rave reviews!

I made a small change... I am gluten intolerant, so I skipped the pasta and substituted homemade GF crepes... they melt into the cheese and are amazing, plus it gets better the second day. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

As mentioned by others, this is a decent starter recipe. If you don't add additional spices, you'll have a rather bland lasagna. I highly recommend heavily seasoning the chicken since it plays such an important part in the recipe. Baking as opposed to poaching will impart much more flavor to the chicken. For added depth added veggies are a must. I added onions and peppers but as others mentioned mushrooms and spinach would be as well. If you like cheesy lasagna this is not the lasagna for you. The amount of cheese called for adds nice flavor but doesn't make it cheesy. For cheesy lasagna, try adding another cup of cheese.

My family loves this recipe, but warning- don’t let the “25 minute prep time” fool you! I’m lucky if I prep it in under 90 minutes. Between boiling and shredding the chicken, cooking the noodles, and layering it all, it’s a very time intensive dish, but I absolutely love this recipe and everyone I’ve ever made it for requests it again!! A few tips:
-I have cooked the chicken in a slow cooker to make it easier to shred but it gives it that very obvious slow cooked chicken flavor and we don’t like it quite as much. 
-I do usually double the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan. 
-I use 1.5x the amount of cheese it suggests in order to have enough for the top. Since I double it, I put 4 cups in the cheese/chicken mixture and two cups on top.
- If it’s cold when I put it in the oven, I bake it covered with tin foil and a bit of ventilation for 55 mins, and then another 15 to brown the cheese on top.
-I’ve also tried various sauces and 1/3 fat cream cheese. Pretty much no matter what we do, this recipe is just delicious!  
Definitely a go-to recipe in my house! LOVE!

Gave 4 stars, because I added things to the recipe.
Husband has high cholesterol, so I omitted the cream cheese and, instead, used my own homemade (low fat) white sauce.  Added celery, red peppers, mushrooms, garlic & onions to chicken mixture.  Served for a family dinner, hoping for leftovers.  None!  Everyone, including picky grandson, loved it!

My family loves this recipe, too. I changed the number of noodles to nine--I like it better with noodles on the bottom. I have used low fat cream cheese with the same results as regular cream cheese. Next week I will be making enough to feed my son, his fellow football linebackers, and any others that show up!

This was good, but not 5 stars good. I prefer lasagna with beef/sausage over chicken therefore if I go through the hassle of making lasagna again, it'll be with beef/sausage, not chicken.

This is definitely a favorite.  I love the use of cream cheese.  Every since I found this recipe i only make chicken lasagna.  The only thing i have started to do that is different is adding a layer of spinach. MY family and neighbors love when I make this. Thumbs up.

This was outstanding.  I could not make lasagne without garlic and parmesean cheese though, so I added garlic to the water for poaching the chicken and garlic to the cream cheese mixture as well as parmesean in the mixture and on top.  The texture of the cream cheese is what made this dish so special.  I will be using cream cheese more in italian cooking in the future because of this recipe.  Much less expensive than mascarpone.

This is a great variation on lasagna - much lighter than traditional.  I added a package of frozen spinach, sliced mushrooms, and garlic to the cream cheese mixture to add more flavor.  Great recipe!

This is a favorite dish in our home.  I have been making it for the past two years and rarely are there leftovers.  I add a couple ingredients though.  I sautee 3 cloves of minced garlic in some olive oil and then use 5 oz. (1/2 box) frozen spinach, making sure to press out all of the water.  I add this to my chicken/cheese mixture and WOW, it adds some yummy flavor to this dish!

I added 1 cup cottage cheese to my chicken/cheese mixture, I had it in the fridge and needed to use it up:)  I never cook my lasagna noodles and they always come out fine, I will however probably add another 1/4 water or maybe even milk, it turned out a little dry because I didn't cook my noodles.  I put a chicken layer, then noodles, then spaghetti sauce, and repeat.  I topped with some mozzarella/pizza cheese.  In total I used 4 cups of cheese too.  My hubs said he thinks he prefers chicken lasagna to "regular" beef lasagna, and he's Italian!! I'm not however so maybe I don't have "that great Italian lasagna" that would make him a "regular" lasagna lover:)  Repeatable recipe.

Great basic recipe that people can build from.  The instructions are a bit unclear, I read it that I was to put all the chicken mixture on that bottom layer.  I'm still not sure which way it should be, but it tasted just fine!  I keep hoping to find a chicken lasagna recipe that can make my Hubby happy ... I thought this would be it, but apparently he wants me to keep looking.  (But I don't think I will! ;-)

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I added chopped sauteed onions and garlic to the poached chicken. I also used the poaching liquid instead of water to add to the bouillion. I increased the liquid because I was using the no boil lasagna noodles. It turned out great! I prefer it to the heavy beef ricotta "regular" lasagna. Thanks!

Great recipe, but I did double the cheese mixture and I added some italian seasonings.  I also found that one jar of tomato sauce wasn't enough, so I doubled that too.  It made for hearty two filled layers.

Loved this recipe, my boyfriend and I are very picky with our food, nice and simple.  A easier way with the chicken mixture is to cook it with your sauce, everything blends and melts together easier.  I also prefer to use 5-6 chicken breasts instead of 3.

Great recipe.  Marinated the chicken in Italian dressing and added some sautee'd garlic and onion to the chicken mixture.  Added parm to the cheese.  My 7yr old told me it was better then anything she ever ate and my husband loved it also.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm not a huge fan of lasagna, usually, so this was perfect for me. Anything with cream cheese is awesome. I wondered how the cream cheese would mix with red sauce, but it was wonderful. This had all of the things I enjoy about lasagna without the bulky hamburg taste that I don't like. Even my excessively picky eaters gobbled this up and demanded I make it again. That never happens, so thank you for this recipe!!

I wish I could give it 4.5 or 4.8 because the only reason it's not a 5-star is because it's not spicy. I'm slightly biased.

This is really good and really easy...However, it definitely needs some seasonings!  Maybe mix in some traditional italian seasoning with the chicken, cream cheese and 1 C. mozzarella.  I used a 9 inch square baking dish and it was the perfect size.  I will try another reviewers suggestion of adding a layer of spinach next time as well.

Disappointed after reading the wonderful reviews.  I followed the recipe with the exception of poaching the chicken with onions, bay leaf and peppercorns to add more flavor.  It was still bland.  The cream cheese mixture was hard to spread and did  not get very creamy after it was cooked.  I ended up picking out the chicken/cream cheese mixture and just eating the noodles and sauce.  I will keep searching for a chicken lasagna recipe.

Oh my gosh!  This is quite possibly one of the best meals I have ever prepared!  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and poached the chicken with bay leaves, peppercorns & onion.  When I mixed the cream mixture I added Outrageously Garlic & Great Caesar's Ghost Blend (both by Two Sisters Gourmet).  It turned out so good!  I will definitely be adding this to my list of recipes to make again!

My new favorite lasagna in the world! I didn't have chicken boullion so I just left it out and added a tsp of oregano and a bit of pepper to the chicken/cheese mixture instead. I also used 9 noodles instead of 6. And I didn't have enough mozzarella cheese so I used mozzarella and parmesan. I covered with tin foil and removed it the last 20 minutes of cooking. Make sure to let it sit for at least 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven. This was fantastic and I will be making this again soon! Hubby had 3 servings and took more for lunch today!

Made this the other night and it turned out delicious! I added 2 tablespoons of pesto to cream cheese mixture along with about 3/4 cup shaved parmesan cheese and just enough broth to soften the cream cheese mixture then I just tossed the shredded chicken (pre-broiled from store) with 1/2 the marinara sauce before spreading on top of cream cheeses and noodles, a layer of chicken then noodles and cream cheese, then repeat. You do need more noodles then called for, unless you use a smaller casserole dish (9x9) but then, it will be more dense, which is what we like. Sprinkled a blend of mozzarella  and sharp cheddar cheese on top with some seasoned Panko bread crumbs and cover with foil and bake. Take foil off for the last few minutes. Bubbly and delicious it really is the best comfort food for the fall season.

This is a great alternative to traditional lasagna.  I used low fat cream cheese and added cayenne.  I've also tried a low carb version using grilled zuchinni strips as the pasta.  Turns out great both ways.

This recipe is perfect as is.  My entire family loves it... a real feat considering they normall hate lasagna.  It has a creamy texture that really tastes amazing.

I made this recipe last night and it was so yummy. I lightly cooked onions, mushrooms, diced green/red peppers, and garlic in light olive oil and added it to my speghetti sauce. I also added chilli flakes to add some heat. In the creem cheese mixture I also added a bit of salt, pepper and cajun seasoning. My husband loved it. It was spicy but was had a great creamy balance. I will defianetly be making this again.

Very good and very quick.  The cheese on the top of mine was over cooked so I would wait until it is almost done to put the layer on.  Also, put a layer of noodles in the bottom even though the recipe doesn't say to.

This was excellent!  I used 1/4 cup of chicken broth instead of boullion and water.  Everyone inhaled it!  Will definitely make again and again!

I wanted a larger lasagne so I used a 9 x 13 pan, 2 jars of sauce and 8 lasagne noodles.  I kept all other ingredients the same but added a box of thawed chopped frozen spinach (I've also used fresh), salt/pepper, parmesan, basil and garlic to the chicken mixture.  The directions for layering are a bit odd.  I recommend starting with a bit of sauce and then a layer of noodles as the first layer.  It was very tasty and quite economical with only 3 pieces of chicken.

This was sooo good!  I did make a few changes though.  I used no boil lasagna noodles, reduced fat cream cheese, added garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning and rosemary to the mixture.  I also cut down on the cheese slightly and replaced some of the mozzarella with Parmesan.  This stuff is the ultimate comfort food!  My husband who HATES cream cheese, never knew it was in there and raved about how awesome it was and said he could eat this all the time.  Even my 6 year old finished her plate and asked me to make it again!  Serve with salad and toasted french bread.

i add 2-3 cloves of garlic, a small onion, basil, ½ cup spinach, parmesan, and pepper to the chicken mixture, as well as using ½ ricotta and ½ cream cheese. I put it in a 5 x 9 pan, and put a layer of noodles between the sauce and chicken. It is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend always asks for this when there's a special occasion.

I am making this again tonight for dinner. It is excellent.  I don't cook my lasagna noodles.  I added a little extra water (about 1/4 cup) to the cream cheese mixture and a little extra water to the sauce (1/4 to 1/2 cup) and bake it a little longer.

I was really skeptical about this - might be 'too creamy', chicken might be 'too weird' or 'too dry' but it was really awesome. I did put some Italian seasoning in there but at the end either don't like the one I have or maybe don't think it was needed at all.  I also used the ready-bake noodles, so thank you to the reviewer who posted to make sure it was covered while cooking to make sure the noodles cooked all the way.  I've heard the secret to poached chicken - to maintain moistness - is to make sure the chicken cools completely in the water before removing to shred.  After baking, this was totally delicious and moist - the chicken comes out soft and full of flavor.  I didn't miss the ricotta or anything - this version stands alone perfectly.  Really enjoyed it! BTW, my  2.5 year old devoured this.

I must have done something terribly wrong, but this was really just very average to me.  I shouldn't have tried it since I don't like the texture of cream cheese in hot casserole-type dishes.  Too grainy.  My husband loved it though.

Nothing really wrong with this just not a favorite of my family.  One child said it was too tomatoey; the other child didn't like that I had shredded the chicken. Husband ate it with not complaints but no words of praise either. I thought it was okay not really something I will be making again.

This was good, but needed seasoning and wasn't really creamy due to excess sauce. I think 26 oz was just a bit too much (for me anyway). I'm gonna alter it a bit and try again. I can tell it does have great potential.

I roasted a turkey, and was looking for ways to use up the abundance of meat that I had in the fridge.  I came across this recipe and figured I could just exchange the roasted turkey for chicken and it worked out just fine.  I followed some of the suggestions and added sauteed yellow and green onion, red pepper, mushroom, garlic and red pepper flakes.  I used roasted garlic spaghetti sauce from Trader Joes to save time and it worked out nicely.  I went with three cups of mozzarella instead of two, and a 1/3rd cup of parmigiano reggiano.   I forgot to add spinach, and wished that I had as it was a bit on the rich side.  I substituted a spinach side salad which helped.  If I were to make this again, I think I would layer in either yellow squash or zucchini.

This was an excellent meal!  I made a couple of modifications.  I baked the chicken and then added onions, thawed frozen spinach, garlic powder and oregano to the cream cheese mixture.  I also used the no boil noodles and it turned out fabulous.  I added mushrooms to the spaghetti sauce and used an additional 1/2 c. of cheese.

I really enjoyed this.  I did 3 layers of noodles instead of just 2 and also added some thawed and drained frozen chopped spinach over each cheese layer.  My husband raved about it.  I may incorporate the cream cheese into my standard meat lasagna.

I used grilled chicken for extra chicken flavor.  Great basic recipe ... anything could be added.

This is literally my FAVORITE dinner.  My hard to please boyfriend LOVES this lasagna.  It is perfect for potlucks as it is extremely easy to make....everyone who tries it will beg you for the recipe!  I got my parents hooked, and dad added fresh spinach & mushrooms...great variation.  I make it with reduced fat cream cheese & today I made it using whole wheat lasagna noodles...can't tell the difference!

Not a bad lasagna! I made this for a party last week along with the "Worlds Best Lasagna" from this site. Had to be one with chicken as the guest of honor didn't eat beef or pork. It's not lasagna that I'm used to but it was a nice change. I had both on the plate and did like the beef/Italian sausage lasagna better but that's just me!! I did make a few changes. 1. I used two 8oz packages of cream cheese, 4 chicken breasts, and extra mozzarella to extend the filling out a little, 2, used fresh homemade lasagna noodles from an AR recipe. 3, I made homemade marinara sauce from a "doctored" pizza sauce recipe also from AR. With a crowd of almost 20 people I wanted to make a deeper dished lasagna so I made this one double layered. I found that taking handfuls of the chicken mixture and making them into thin patties, I was able to get the filling to layer very even with out trying to "spread" it. Just made too much of a mess. 4, I added lots of spices. I don't recall which ones, but it would be quite bland if you don't help it in that respect. Just let your taste buds guide you alone on that part! I'll keep this recipe and will be making it again! Change is nice once in a while.

A simple combination of ingredients that disappears so fast in my house!  I have made this twice now, and there are never leftovers.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

As many other reviewers said, a few additions really make a difference.  To cut down on salt I omitted the bouillon cube and added garlic, a tsp of dried thyme and a handful of fresh basil.  I also browned the chicken after poaching.  Altogether this gave it more than enough flavour to replace the stock cube.  A good recipe base to build upon.

I would have given this five if I hadn't had to make any changes.  I also added minced garlic, green pepper, onion, mushroom and spinach to the cheese mixture.  With that simple change it was a real winner!  My whole family raved!

I gave a 5 even though i didnt make exactly as stated. Taking advice of others i sauteed about 1/4 red onion, 1 garlic clove with salt, pepper, oregano and basil. To this i added some fresh spinach. The smell was wonderful! I mixed this in with the chicken, cream cheese, bouillon and cheese. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. This was delicious! Im looking forward to having leftovers tonight~ not that there is much left! Thank you for sharing this keeper!!

It tasted just like regular lasagna with chicken instead of hamburger, which had a weird mouth feel.  I am going to try Cajun Chicken Lasagna next...

This was absolutely wonderful... I made it last friday for my boyfriend, and my two little sisters and grand little sisters (In Phi Mu Fraternity) and they all raved about it!  My little's just could not telling me how this was the best lasagna they'd ever had!  I was so happy because I was looking for a satisfying replacement for beef in pasta and I found it!  The only things I changed were to use 9 noodles instead of six and to add some sauce to the chicken/cheese mixture.  I found the mixture to spread much better this way and the taste was absolutely perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing, this one's going in my real recipe box :)

This was pretty good; we enjoyed it and thanks for sharing.  I sauteed a red bell pepper and an onion to add to the spaghetti sauce to make it more like my regular sauce.  Covered for the first 30 minutes of cooking so that the cheese on top would not brown or burn.  Next time will add garlic to the sauce as well.

Came out great! I did alter a bit though. I did half low fat cream cheese, half ricotta. I also added some extra seasoning to the chicken - garlic, salt, pepper, etc...I also had a mexican cheese blend instead of mozzarella. Will do again, thanks!

I think it was the cream cheese that did not make this dish for us.  I did add the spinach as some suggested, but I would only go for half a package if I make it again.  It looked and smelled fabulous but did not deliver in the texture department.

This is soooo good! Easy too, I used the "no boil" lasagna noodles and doubles the recipe for a 9x13 pan (we have a big family) and everyone was fighting for the last piece!

Wow, this was one of my favorite things I've ever made on Allrecipes!  Delicious!  Unfortunately, my husband thought it was just ok, but he's crazy and I'm rating it a 5 anyway.  Thanks for the absolutely delicious meal!

I doubled the lasagna to fit a standard casserole dish.  At first I was nervous about it being too salty, but after it cooks the salty taste mellows.  I felt it would have been better if I had added some cottage cheese, maybe half mozzarella half cottage cheese.  Ended up using Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese (can't taste a difference and has less fat) and added onion, garlic, mushrooms, green pepper and spinach (that tasted very nice, and somewhat healthy).  Also used oven ready noodles, and less spaghetti sauce than it called for, but I don't think that would really make a huge taste difference.  Overall it's a very good recipe.  We'll have it again sometime.  Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic - tasted really good!  I made it for my husband and he said it was the best lasagna he has ever had - he said it was the best dinner I have ever made for him (been together 10 years!).  I made some small changes to the recipe: I added some onions and garlic to the chicken mixture and I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top (along with a bit more mozzarella and cheddar) and I used Primo Garden Tomato and Mushroom spaghetti sauce.  I made it in the 9 inch pan but would make it in an 8 inch pan the next time - I found that the chicken mixture was almost not enough to spread over the 9 inch pan.

My husband said it was "a 10, a perfect 10".  Thanks very much - will definitely make this one again.

This was very good. I did add some garlic to give flavor (and well, we like garlic).  I also made my own sauce...don't like the jar varieties.  Thanks for such a unique recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I liked the cream cheese versus the ricotta used in normal lasagna and the chicken was a nice twist.  I definitely agree with other reviewers about going with the 8x8 pan.

Made this last night and it was FANTASTIC!!!  I basically doubled (tripled the chicken and spag. sauce) the recipe since I cook on Sunday for the whole week and I was able to make 2 9 X 13 pans and a small 8 X 8 pans, we LOVE leftovers.  I, too, put my chicken in the crockpot in the early AM and then just shredded in the afternoon before making, seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powder.  I added sautéed chopped white onion and threw in raw mushrooms like a few reviewers suggested and just used Prego for the sauce.  Used reduced fat cream cheese and went light on the mozzarella to try to make less fattening.  Also used no bake noodles.  Hubby RAVED about it and honestly, what a nice change from regular lasagna.  I like cream cheese but more in a dish than plain and not huge amounts and I thought the amount was just right, didn't seem overly "cream cheesey" to me at all.  Layering is kind of a mess but totally worth it for this dish!  This is one we will make often!!  I definitely think you can add your fave veggies to this for added nutrition or taste as well.

I used lots of left over turkey from Christmas. I brought in a 11 3/4" roasting tin last night to a girl's Xmas get together (there was still LOTS of kids and one man lol) I slow cooked the turkey in chicken broth, garlic and italian seasoning as suggested. It shredded perfectly. I then threw it in my stand mixer with a package of dry Italian dressing mix, 2 packages low fat cream cheese and loads of chopped mushrooms. For the sauce I mixed 1 jar of Rosee and 1 tomato and basil spaghetti sauce. Layered it 3-4 times. It was gone in seconds!! The host's husband accused me of purchasing it from Costco or something haha

Taste so good with some rice and broccoli on the side!! Though I made it with chicken breasts and cut down the baking time.

I've made this recipe twice as written, and it turns out fantastic.  It's a great change from lasagna with beef.

This was really different but really good! The ingredients are very simple too. My family loved it....just as is...and I don't think I want lasagna with beef again....okkkkk....I wouldn't say ever again...I really do prefer this though. Thanks for the alternative for this busy mom of 4.

Really good. If you want it even better add some vegetables! I used spinach and mushrooms and it really added to the flavor. Cook them up first until they begin to wilt and then add them to a layer of your lasagne.

I liked this as a base recipe. I always tweak just a bit. My husband and son both hate cream cheese so I used cream of mushroom. I didn't have enough mozzarella, so I topped off with some provolone. I didn't have lasagna noodles so I used bowtie. I added Italian seasonings to the spaghetti sauce and simmered it while I steamed the chicken. And I also topped off with pepperoni!!! My son ate it up. The hubby liked it. I personally liked the cream cheese version I made myself, but theirs was not bad at all. Next time I will definitely add peas and fresh spinach. I will definitely double/triple and pepper the chicken, add paprika to the spaghetti sauce and some red pepper to the chicken mixture to make it bite. Really liked it though. has so much potential!

Love! I converted this to 'Creamy Buffalo Chicken Lasagna'...I seasoned the chicken before cooking with lawry's salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic pepper. I also heated the spaghetti sauce and added 'Original Anchor Bar Wing sauce- Hotter flavor', about an 1/8 tsp of oregano and cummin(maybe less), and a bit of pepper. Then to the chicken/cream cheese mixture I added a tad bit more of the wing sauce and about a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper(also to taste). My boyfriend loved it!!...More than his ex's recipe for buffalo chicken lasagna. :) Score!

Soooo good! The cream cheese is what makes this recipe so delicious! I think it is just a nice refreshing change from the original lasagna-types. I actually started making this without realizing that I was out of chicken, so I actually made this with hamburger (turkey burger) and I substituted beef boullion for the chicken boullion. So this recipe is very versatile! I will definitely make this again!

Best Lasagna ever!!!!! I get tons of compliments from friends and familiy....
I did follow the alternate that "Littleone250" used with the peppers and spinach sauted with garlic.. once I shut off the stove I place the cream cheese and let it melt with the peppers and spinach.... 
Gives a different flavor and kick to this lasagna...
Enjoy!!!

This was delicious! I used rotisserie chicken, and it was excellent. I would probably add a pinch of Italian seasonings. It would be much prettier as a thicker, and more layered lasagna, but it's still great.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is great!  It's also a good base recipe for variations... substitute sauteed onion and mushroom for the chicken, or add a package of frozen spinach for a veggie...

Also, I made this last week (as described, with spinach added to the cheese mixture, low-fat cream cheese and no-boil noodles) and then put it in the freezer for a week before baking it.  It took longer (1.5 hours at 350 covered with foil) and it came out GREAT!

This was great.  I didn't have lasagna noodles or mozzarella cheese, so I used spiral noodles and cheddar cheese and only baked it for 30 minutes.  It was wonderful.  Great flavor.   My picky family gave it rave reviews.  Thanks for the recipe, it is definitely a keeper.

This was really good.  My boyfriend hates ricotta cheese so he never wants to have lasagna.  I found this recipe and we tried it.  The only change we made was add extra sauce.  I also didnt care for the way the uncooked lasagna softened.  Next time i will use regular boiled noodles. Other then that it was great!

This recipe is great and really creamy no matter how often one reheats this.  I substituted beef for chicken as I did not have chicken and tasted great.  I will try this with chicken next time.  I used just the plain lasagna noodles and no need to boil.  The noodles will be perfectly cooked just by baking. As the others suggested, this bakes better using glass bakeware and covered with foil except for the last 10 minutes of baking.

They taste amazingly good and so easy to make. My boyfriend loved them and ate 3 servings of it in one night. I made it second time tonight and still tasted great. Definitely a keeper.

This was an easy dish to make, using no bake noodles.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese - garden flavor and added a few sprinkles of a garlic & basil herb blend.  I doubled the recipe (except for the noodles - I used 9) and used a 9x13 deep lasagna dish, covering the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes.  It came out thick and very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! I rarely even make beef lasagna anymore! I personally do not prefer to use the ready-to-bake noodles. I tried it once like that & didn't like it as much. I also tried it with chunks of chicken instead of shredding it & definitely prefer the shredded. It makes the filling so much creamier. I would recommend using a pan the next size down, 7x11 I believe it is. It makes a much fuller looking lasagna.

This was really good! Will probably make again. I liked that it was pretty cohesive and not all runny like some lasagnas. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did add various seasonings, etc (onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes), without which it would not have been as flavorful.

I thought this recipe was very good!  I did add spices (italian seasoning, salt & pepper) to the chicken & cheese mixture as well as sauteed mushrooms and onions which I think is a must.  There definitely aren't enough flavors in the original recipe.  I also used the oven ready noodles which is sooo much easier.  I did cover the dish for a majority of the time and them uncovered for the last 15 minutes to let the cheese melt.  Would recommend to others!

Five stars with the altercations that others mentioned:  sauté onions, mushrooms, peppers add to meat/cheese mixture before the layering.  I used low fat cream cheese and half fat-free mozzarella and half low-fat mozzarella cheese.  I also bought fat free marinara sauce from Trader Joes, couldn’t even tell that it was a “low fat” dish!  I also just used an 8x8 dish, did three layers of two noodles.  Turned out delicious!  Great alternative to ricotta cheese and fatty hamburger meat, I don’t feel bad eating this Italian dish!

I tried this recipe two times.  The first time I shredded the chicken and the second time I cubed the chicken...shredded is better.  Also, I used a slightly smaller pan following the advise of another member.  Perfect!

Excellent.  A great change from the ordinary lasagna.  I did add onion powder, garlic powder and pepper to the chicken as it boiled.  I also added fresh garlic, onion powder, dried basil, oregano and italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  What a great recipe!  I will be making this again for sure.

This turned out so tasty. As with most casseroles I make, I baked it the night before, then reheated it to serve the next day -- it's just so much better if it sets up properly. I used regular lasagna noodles, but didn't bother to cook them. I switched up the layers a little bit -- sauce, noodle, chicken, sauce, noodle, chicken, sauce, cheese -- so that the noodles would be between sauce and chicken to get the most moisture out. The "disolve in water step" had me a bit puzzled in terms of how much water to use, so I started with a cup to disolve, then poured another half cup into the chicken mixture figuring it would get absorbed by the noodles. I also threw some Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder into the chicken mixture -- was the perfect amount of extra flavor. What I really like about this recipe -- besides the great taste -- is how it didn't outweigh the pan. So many lasagna recipes have too many layers and too much in them and end up being a 90-pound beast of a casserole, but this was really perfect. Not too thick and running over. Sounds like a small thing, but it drives me crazy to have a casserole bake over in my oven. Will definitely make this one a staple. Couldn't have been easier.

EXCELLENT!!!  My husband said this was outstanding and one of the best dishes I had ever made.  One change...I used 1 pound of ground chicken just because I hate shredding boiled chicken.  I added some minced garlic to the chicken, too.  Although some reviewers thought it was too much cheese, you will love it if you're like me and "too much cheese" just is not in your vocabulary!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Delicious! I had hoped that my husband would like this even though he isn't a fan of cream cheese, but he wasn't able to eat it. More for me anyways. :) I thought it was truly delicious.

The best lasagna ever!  Thank you for this recipe.  I used no boil noodles and added chopped spinach, garlic powder and fresh parmesean to the cream cheese/chicken mixture. Froze it and had for dinner during the week. It was absolutely delicious! Sent the recipe to a few friends to try.

Wow!!! This was great! I loved the creaminess of the chicken/cream cheese mixture. I was afraid it would taste like ricotta(bleh) but it didn't.  Next time I make this, I will increase the chicken/cream cheese mixture because I like a thicker lasagna.  A definite keeper.  Also, very simple to make in a pinch or the night before!

Easy to make, great flavor and not so large that you end up throwing half of it out!  PERFECT for a family of four.  My three year old even liked it!!  I even used reduced fat cream cheese, 2% mozzarella and a no sodium chicken bouillon packet for a healthier version.  IT was so yummy I can't imagine what the "real" version tastes like!!

I loved the idea of using cream cheese in a lasagna. I can't believe that didn't think of that. It did have a nice creamy texture. I used 9 noodles and had 3 layers in a 13x9 dish. I poached my chicken in broth and Mrs. Dash extra spicy and used some of the broth to mix with the cream cheese. I also used some italian seasoning in the cream cheese mixture. I'm afraid without the extra seasoning this would have been very bland, considering there were no spices in the ingredient list. Next time I think I'll try adding some onions and mushrooms.

I used two huge chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds) instead of the three called for. I cooked the noodles until they were just cooked, not even to the point of al dente yet, so they wouldn't get too soft in the lasagna. I used the Boiled Chicken recipe as suggested by a previous reviewer - great advice! Thanks! Instead of the bouillon cube, I used 1/4 cup of the stock from the chicken. I used more like 1½ cups of mozzarella in the chicken mixture. NOTE: Spreading the chicken mixture can be a pain! After the first layer on top of the sauce, I got irked and spread it on TOP of the noodles. Yeah, it changed the order, but it was less difficult. Pouring the sauce over it was easy. Oh, yeah, and I made a 9"x13" pan of it, so I just mixed the pasta sauce with a can of diced tomatoes (and some Italian seasoning) to make up for the larger pan. I added some sauteed onions and mushrooms to both the sauce and the chicken mixture, and I sprinkled some Parmesan on top of the whole thing. Thanks, Caroline, I dislike Ricotta so this was excellent! :)

Wow! This lasagna was amazingly delicious! I made it for my family and everyone was really happy with it. I have never had lasagna before without ricotta cheese, so I was a little nervous about using cream cheese, but I was proved wrong. The cream cheese makes for a really rich, thick, creamy filling. Mmmm-mmm. I even used some leftover Mascarpone cheese in the filling. As for additions, I sautéed one large onion and 2 cloves of garlic and added that to the mixture, along with Italian seasoning, dried basil, and some freshly chopped parsley, along with salt and pepper. Also, I pan-fried my chicken in olive oil instead of boiling it. It all came out wonderfully. I definitely will make this again and again!

I love this!  Have made it twice, the second time I doubled the chicken, because husband likes lots of meat,and it tasted like tuna caserole :( You should stay with the called for ammount.  I used, both times, chicken from the boiled chicken recipe on this site, much easier and alot faster. I make the chicken and have cooked chicken for this recipe, encheladas, and curry chicken sandwiches for hubbys lunch.  YUMMY!!!

My family loved this.  This is going in my regular rotation of dinners. Prep time was pretty quick as I already had cooked chicken on hand.  We loved how creamy the chicken was in this recipe!  
 I did make a few changes.  First I was out of lasagna noodles, so I just used layers of penne pasta.  It was great, but I had to add a lot more sauce.  Next time I will definately try with the lasagna noodles.  I also added some fresh chopped spinach to the chicken. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and was still impressed at how creamy it made the chicken. (I also used fresh chicken broth from the chicken I had previously cooked instead of boullion)  Next time I am going to try adding a few chopped tomatoes to the sauce.  Thanks for this keeper.  
It is not often I find a recipe that I feel is low-fat & healthy and at the same time quick enough for me to throw together on a busy night.

I made this for my son and about 5 of his teenage friends. They all LOVED it. I should've made TWO pans. A couple said they liked it better than regular ground beef lasagna. I did double the amount of the chicken mixture and it was perfect. I recommend this recipe.

I added frozen chopped spinach as other reviewers mentioned and it was very good.  Different, but good.  I will definitely make again in the future.

I made this for my family last night, it was amazing! I doubled the chicken and mozzarella and added italian seasoning and garlic powder to the mix. I also sauteed diced mushrooms, onions, and garlic. I added it to the chicken mixture. I added a little parmesan cheese to the mix and also sprinkled some on top. I made it in a 9x13 dish, it fit perfectly. This a very good starting recipe that you can customize! My husband loved it!!!

Delicious!  We loved this lasagna.  Sauteed some onion, green pepper and red pepper to add to it and used light cream cheese.  This is the lasagna recipe I've been looking for.

It was very tasty!!  I did make some changes after reading reviews form other people. I used non pre-cook pasta and roasted some mushrooms, onion, garlic and peppers and then chopped them up in small pieces and added this to the chicken mixture.  I also added a can of chopped tomaotoes to the tomato sauce and some fresh grated parmasan and fresh basil on top  I had a fan asssited oven and I think it was overcooked in 33 minutes so I would only cook it next time for 25 probably or put the oven tempature down.  I will make it again at my next dinner party.

Pretty good, but probably won't make it again. Maybe I didn't shred the chicken well enough.

A friend gave me this recipe but hers had a box of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained) and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning added to the cheese mixture, and also an extra layer of noodles on the bottom (over the sauce but under the chicken). It is a family favorite that we have every couple of weeks.

So good! I used a 9x13 baking dish and just doubled the recipe (using sauce generously). I added 1 tbsp. of Italian seasoning to the cream cheese mixture. This was excellent! Everyone had an extra piece.

Personally, I did not care for this at all! But the other 3 people who ate it said they liked it. I really didnt like the cream cheese in this dish. Disgusting! No matter how much my husband liked it I wont make it again.

I would highly recommend this recipe.  My husband doesn't usually go on about anything but he really like this one.  He also ate it as left overs the following day and that "never" happens.  Great easy recipe.  I used no boil lasagna noodles which made it a lot easier and it tasted great.

Very good and very easy to prepare. I used no boil lasagne and I found it was easier for me to spread the chicken/cheese mixture on the lasagne first and then add the sauce. Will pass this recipe on!

Surprisingly good.  Mistakenly I picked up shredded parmasean cheese instead of mozzarella and it was still good. Next time I make it and it will be soon I will make sure to get the right cheese.  I also season the shredded chicken with garlic powder, s&p and Italian seasoning.  Thought it might otherwise be to bland for me.  OH I forgot to mention I did use oven ready pasta as well.  Just made sure the pasta was covered with sauce and it came out beautifully.

I bought a rotisserie chicken; de-boned, shredded, and cut up the meat with kitchen scissors. Because of the cream cheese, it's a bit "rich", but no one complained! It was great!

Very good! As others suggested, I added seasoning and chopped spinach to the chicken mixture. Also, I boiled the chicken breasts in some broth instead of water. With these tweaks, this one's definitely going in my recipe box!

My family loves this recipe! The only thing I do differently is use oven-ready lasagna noodles as this saves me that step of boiling the noodles (and washing the pot!). If you do use oven-ready noodles, make absolutely sure to cover the dish tightly with foil so the noodles will cook. Great recipe!

Very, very tasty! My husband and I don't eat beef much anymore, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I gave it four stars because I did make some changes to the original recipe. I baked a whole chicken and shredded the meat. I also sautéed some mushrooms and onions, along with four minced garlic cloves. I used 1 TBSP of Italian herbs, mixed in with the cream cheese. And I chopped about two cups of fresh spinach and added those to the layers. I ended up using about 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce, too. But it made a large 9X13" dish. Definitely a keeper!

I absolutely love this recipe! I did make some changes though. Instead of using mozzarella I used Parmesan, and instead of spaghetti sauce i used marinara sauce. I also used cooked lasagna noodles and didnt use water with the chicken bouiloin cube. It came out perfect and it just goes to show you can still make a delicious dish using whats around you. Thanks allrecipes for sharing.

Holy cow this is good! I followed the advice of another poster who said she poached a frozen chicken. In my water, I added salt, onions, salt, and bay leaves. Let it simmer for 2 hours. I also made my own sauce with tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic, onions, oregano, italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. I also added mushrooms into the sauce and had some broccoli left in the fridge that I chopped up and threw in there as well. I used 9 no boil pasta noodles, making it three layers. I also used only 3/4 of the cream cheese because that's all I had. And on top of the lasagna, I sprinkled Kraft shredded cheese that contains parmesan, romano and asiago over the mozzarella. Baked for about 40 minutes covered, then uncovered and broiled for 5. My husband and I both loved it and lucky for us, we had leftovers for dinner the next day!
**EDIT** I just wanted to come back to this recipe and update on how many people rave about this meal when I make it. I have now made it for several friends and family members at dinner parties and it has been dubbed as my "signature lasagna dish". I have never made a different lasagna since finding this recipe over a year ago because it is just THAT GOOD. And the fact that it is truly so SIMPLE to do makes it even better. I even stopped making my own sauce when I make this because I have noticed it tastes fabulous even if you use pre-made pasta sauce (Preggo traditional is the best!!). If you're on the fence about making this, just do it! Your taste buds

I made this lasagna for dinner tonight and it was SUPERB!!! So delicious the kids loved it!! I added spinach to the chicken mixture and made sure to season it as suggested by other reviews.  I layered my sauce first then the lasagna noodle, mixture then sauce. Noodles, mixture, sauce and so on. I will make this again!

I have made this dish twice and it is DELICIOUS!! This is not only the fastest lasagna that I've ever made but it doesn't leave me feeling jipped. Some chicken or veggie lasagna recipes make me regret not just making a traditional lasagna but this is not one of those. Who needs the beef!?! DELISH!!

PRETTY GOOD! To properly fit a 9x13 pan, I doubled the cream cheese filling and used almost two jars of sauce. I also added lots of garlic and basil.

I made this for dinner tonight.  The guys loved it!  I substituted 1 cup chicken broth for the 1/4 cup water and chicken bouillon.  It tasted fantastic!

This is by far the best Lasagna i have EVER had!!! I made my own sauce and it was awesome! I made it for a womens bible study group full of some amazing cooks and they all insisted on the recipe! " Better than any regular lasagna they had ever had! "

I've made this recipe as-is and it is delicious. I've also made it with some modifications: added some spices (oregano, parsley flakes, garlic powder, onion powder), and I even added a generous handful of fruit/veggie pulp from my juicer to the cheese mixture. Despite my pulp being a strange combo of carrot, spinach, grape, apple, pear, and orange, I liked it in my lasagna. It wasn't strange at all and didn't diminish from the texture.

Good recipe. I cut back on the cream cheese, and made up for it by using ricotta along with it. I did use a store bought rotisserie chicken,only I cubed it into bite-sized bits which erased the "strangeness" of having chx instead of grnd beef. I did add more dried herbs than called for, but that's something I do regularly, and not due to this recipe alone. Give it a try, but go in knowing that it's NOT "regular lasagna". Enjoy.

This is my go-to recipe when I want something that will fill me up, lasts several meals and is cheap to make. I agree with another review that 9x13 is too large, I use a square pan. This is a great base recipe that you tweet by adding extra fillings. In the past I have added peppers, spinach, mushrooms, broccoli and it always turns out great

so good! everyone in the family loved it! i have tried many different types of lasagna from homemade to restraunt. however, this beat out all of them. i don't really enjoy ground beef so chicken was perfect. i would not recommend changing anything about this recipe. :)

Absolutely delicious. I used ready to bake lasagna noodles and had no problems. Even assembled everything the night before, stuck it in the fridge and baked it the next day. One time I used half pasta sauce half Alfredo sauce. To die for. LOVE this dish!

love this lasagna...only thing i did differently instead of using just the basic cream cheese i used one tub of the philadelphia italian herb cooking cream, and to save on cooking time i used 2 cans of tysons chicken breast, oven ready lasgna noodles, and cooked in an 8x8 glass dish. next time i think i will try doubling up on the lasgna noodles, and less of the sphagetti sauce...cause it did turn out a little "soupyish" but not terrible...will be making this again:)

Made this recipe  (this evening) exactly as described. My kids and hubby ate it up!  I did add some Italian seasoning to the mix. I was concerned because the recipe didn't call for seasoning the chicken.
I am not a cook at all. Was looking for something new. Getting tired of the same thing. My hubby dislikes ricotta cheese. I wasn't' too sure how this was going to coming out, it was pretty good. Easy to make. Will be added to our dinner menu. Thanks

5 stars because I've made this several times and I'm always impressed with how easily it goes together and how delicious it is! Such a versatile recipe too, use leftover cooked chicken or breasts, thighs, anything really! Most recently I made several changes...sauteed an onion, shredded carrot, garlic, chopped red pepper, added oregano and basil. Mixed this in with the chicken mixture. Used oven ready noodles (added extra 1/3 c. water to the tomato sauce) and Italiano shredded cheese. I have added chopped spinach, zucchini and mushrooms before as well (also very good). This was SO easy and superb!! I highly recommend this recipe!!

Something is missing in this recipe for me.  Maybe there is too much cream cheese, I don't know; it was hard for me to eat, though my husband loved it.

We made this for our mother's birthday dinner and it was delicious. This was the first time we are lasagna made with cream cheese and it was really good. Our parents and grandmother were very happy with the lasagna as well. We made the lasagna four layers instead of two like in the recipe. Love this!

I give this a 5 star b/c it is a very good recipe. I made a few alterations to flavor it up a bit. I cooked my chicken the night b4 in my crockpot for 5 hrs. When I made the chicken I used a packet of Italian seasoning on it and I put a can of chicken stock in the crockpot. I diced up a sweet onion, green, & red peppers & sauted them. I added that with the shredded chicken. The next day I did the rest in the morning so it was ready to throw in the oven. Very yummy! Thanks!

I altered this to make it a little more "light".... 
In a bowl I combined:
4oz (instead of 8oz) cream cheese (and used RF)
2 wedges of onion flavored light laughing cow
1 egg
1-2 t dried Parsley
shredded chicken

I took this mix and mixed it like the recipe suggests. But then I also added a layer of fresh spinach, cut into smaller pieces for kids with "texture" issues.
**Both kids cleaned their plates and asked for more!!

This was easy and delicious.  I put the chicken in the slow cooker in the morning with some black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and some fat free Italian dressing then I just shredded it with the juices and omitted the bouillon/water.  I ended up using closer to 2 jars of sauce because it seemed a bit dry with just the one jar.  Will definitely add this to the regular rotation.  Thanks!

I made this last night, and my husband and inlaws raved about it.  It was so incredibly good and it will be on the "monthly dinner list" as my husband puts it. I, too added sauteed orange pepper, onion and mushroom (all finely diced) to the cream cheese mixture.  I ran out of chicken cubes, so I added a vegetable bouillon cube to 1/4 cup. boiling water just to smooth out the cream cheese mixture.  I used fresh, wholewheat lasagna noodles, which made the assembly a breeze. Thank you for posting this recipe.  It's a winner!

The recipe is GREAT.  I've shared it w/many friends! I usually add a layer of fresh spinach over the chicken to some green - it makes it spectacular.  Also, I use ready-to-bake noodles, and as well as occasionally just using a rotisserie chicken if I need a quicker prep.    I have also substituted the chicken for artichoke hearts when making this for friends who are vegetarian - it was FANTASTIC.

This recipe is very bland.  In order to make this a 5 star recipe would be to add some spices to the chicken mixture.  Good basic lasagna to start with.

I added some stuff, but I'm sure even the simple recipe would be yummy! I sauteed some onion in olive oil and butter with about 1/2-1 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp pepper, a pinch of salt, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1 tsp basil. After the onion was just about done, then I added the spinach and heated through. I added a little garlic salt to the water for the chicken and used that same water to boil the noodles. I cut back the chicken to about 2 breasts. I mixed the spinach and onion in with the chicken, cream cheese, shredded cheese, and chicken bouillon. Lastly, I used extra cheese combining mozzarella and colby-jack. It was the BEST lasagna I've ever made and my husband can't wait to take some leftovers to work. My 2 1/2 year old ate every bite on her plate!

Exceptional!  We all loved it.  Only change I made was to sautee some onion, garlic, red pepper and spinach and include it in the chicken mixture.  Great texture and blend of flavours!

I agree with many of the other reviews. This is a good base recipe, but needs some help. I added Italian seasoning to the crem cheese mixture.I also added minced garlic. I think that some fresh baby spinach would also be nice. My family really likes this dish with the changes made.

Without my additions I still would have gave it 4 stars due to the cream cheese.  I love the creaminess it lends.  Anyway, Lasagna's has always been my achilles heel in cooking.  I just don't like way they taste when "I" make them.  This however, was delicious and very easy to make.  My husband loved it.  I stuck with the two layer as I don't like my lasagna too thick. 6 Noodles in a 11x7 dish. Plenty. Poached my chicken with onions, celery tops, garlic and another bouillion cube.  After chicken was done, I also boiled my noodles in the same water.  No sense in wasting it and another layer of flavor it adds. I love the cream cheese filler a lot better than the ricotta. Ricotta can be a bit 'grainy' and Cottage gives off too much liquid. I too, diced my chicken (small chunks) as I envisioned a cleaner cut of lasagna squares than if you shred. I added some fresh cooked spinach (squeezed-DRY), pepper flakes, Kraft Parmesean Cheese, fresh ground black pepper, garlic and a tablespoon of "Salad Supreme Seasoning" (I love that stuff and it's not just for salads). Oh---and 1 egg. I chose Ragu because I like the sweetness it has. This was better than one made the original way but will try next time with mixture of italian sausage & chicken. Now that's got to even more yummier-er.  You think?

I loved this. Alot of my friends have never had chicken lasagna and everyone loved it. I also sauteed mushrooms and onions and added them to the mix. I also used about 4 cups of cheese instead of 2. This is a personal favorite of mine.

I'm only rating this a 5 because of what I added to it.  I sauteed an onion, 1/2 a green pepper, and a zucchini until nice and tender.  I put the veggies into the spaghetti sauce and then added a bunch of garlic, italian seasoning, and parsley.  I also cooked up 9 noodles and used a 13x9 pan, it fit perfectly.  I just layered everything 3 times.  DELISH!

I gave this recipe a 4 but the way I "tweeked" it, it was definately a 5! I sauteed some onion, garlic, and a few jalopenos in some olive oil for a few minutes. I put both cups of mozzerella in chicken mixture, and then added some shredded parmesan on top.I also boiled 9 noodles instead of 6 and did 3 layers instead of 2. I also used a 9x7 pan and it was perfect as suggested by others. Besides that, I followed recipe as is and it was FANTASTIC! My kids requested it again the very next night! YUM!

Wow, we loved this. I boiled 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts for 20 minutes and then shredded.  In the water I boiled the chicken in, I cooked 6 lasagna noodles.  While the noodles were cooking I mixed the chicken, cream cheese, 1/4 cup chicken water (from boiling..so I skipped the bouillion), oregeno, italian seasoning, garlic powder, basil, red pepper, sauteed onion, mozerella cheese, and a little of the spaghetti sauce. I then layered as the recipe calls for in a 9x13 and baked covered for 30 min on 350 and another 5 uncovered.  Fabulous and elegant tasting. I won't hestitate making this for company.

I followed the recipe except for the bouillon, i didnt have any on hand so i used chicken broth in place of the water/bouillon mixture.  It was very good, and something I will be making again. *edit*I had to change my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.  It is excellent reheated the next day.  We loved it!

I have made this twice in a week! I made it at home, and it was so good, I made it again to take to a friend. Each time, I didn't have lasagna noodles, but lots of other kinds. It was better with Rigatoni than Macaroni, but both were still delicious. I've also passed the recipe on to a few people.

I give this a 5 with the changes I made. I bought oven-ready lasagna noodles so I didn't boil them. I used my crock pot to cook the chicken, I put 2 cups water & 2 tsp chicken bouillon with the chicken on high for 2 hours. Then I added a chopped yellow onion and red bell pepper and cooked for another 2 hours on high. To make the chicken mixture I strained out the veg & chicken with a slotted spoon then measured out a cup of liquid to add the the mix. I also used 9 noodles and layered in this order: sauce, 3 noodles, sauce, chicken mix, 3 noodles, sauce, chicken mix then cheese. I covered with foil and baked for 1 hour. It was amazing!

I loved this one! I never even thought of using chicken for lasagna but it was so good. I only had chicken tenderloins so I boiled them until they were done, and since I had no bullion I shredded the chicken and mixed garlic salt and a little spaghetti sauce. Im not a fan of cream cheese so I used ricotta instead and it was good. I would have given it five stars but I felt it lacked something. Next time I will add a layer of mushrooms and mabe some squash. Thanks for sharing.

My family and I loved this recipe, however I made changes, that others suggested. I sauteed garlic and onion in a little butter, added spinach, basil, italian and cut up the chicken and boiled in chicken broth. I also used whole wheat noodles, low fat cream cheese and low fat mozzarella.

Not bad. Followed the recipe exactly. Reminded me a little of enchiladas more than lasagna. Next time I would add garlic, basil, oregano and perhaps spinach. Good base just needs a little something.

Really great recipe!  My family of five (includes 3 young kids) loved it!  I followed the recipe but to cut down on calories/fat I used whole wheat noodles, fat free mozzarella, and low fat cream cheese.  I may try adding some spinach next time, but even without it was great!  This will become a "keeper" for us!  Thanks for sharing!

fantastic recipe! my husband gives it 5 stars the way the recipe is. i give it 4. however, with minimal tweaking it's definitely a 5 star recipe.

i boil the chicken with 3 garlic cloves, an onion cut in quarters, and a small can of chicken stock mixed in the water. when the chicken is done i keep one of the garlic cloves to smash in with the chicken mixture. i discard the rest with the onions and water.

i also use chive and onion cream cheese, instead of regular.

and i always use 3 extra lasagna noodles on the bottom of the dish

i make this weekly!

I have never been a huge fan of lasagna, but this is something completely new! I cannot get enough! I made it for the first time for my husband and another couple and everyone raved over it, and had seconds. The other guy said he has had lasagna at several Italian restaurants recently, and this beats them all! I didn't have any boullion, so I used a 1/4 cup of the chicken water. Plus, I added some seasonings to the water as it was boiling, and to the cheese mixture, as well as some frozen chopped spinach. I'm pretty sure it would be a tad bit bland without seasoning it at all. Oh, and I used fat free cream cheese, and in case anyone is wondering, you couldn't tell at all! And I usually don' care for fat free substitutes. Thanks everyone!

I absolutely adore this recipe--it has become one of my favorite comfort foods!  To make it even easier, I usually just pick up a rotisserie chicken from the market and use that meat for the lasagna.  It always comes out very flavorful.  A favorite, though, was when I used a pre-marinated lemon and garlic turkey tenderloin in place of the chicken.  The flavors were amazing!  I'll never get enough of this dish!

This was actually better than I expected. I even made it with turkey to get rid of some holiday leftovers. I added mushrooms and thawed, frozen spinach to squeeze in some veggies.

Has potential, but as written - with addition of Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle, for us it was just "Meh".  Nothing spectacular, but was edible.  Good way of gettin' rid of leftover chicken.

I was extremely surprised about how well this dish tasted.  The flavor was wonderful.  I was worried the cream cheese would be overpowering but it was delicious!  I think I prefer this recipe to my regular beef lasagna.  I took several suggestions from other reviewers and added spinach and sauteed mushrooms, green peppers and onion.  I used an italian sausage flavored spaghetti sauce as well.  I also used an italian blend of cheese which included romano, mozzarella, and parmesan.  This meal was so delighftul.  I'll definitely make it again!

My 7 an d9 yr olds liked this dish. I tried to sneak in a layer of fresh spinach leaves along with a layer of canned mushrooms sauteed in butter, garlic, onion powder, and balsamic vinegar. The spinach didn't go over so well but personally I couldn't taste it. The cream cheese made the dish rich and my husband went back for seconds. Thanks for a great recipe; we'll see how it is tomorrow after sitting overnight for the flavors to meld.

Lasagna does not stay long in our house. This recipe was not a favorite. I thought it was missing something, maybe spinach, uhmmm. I really did not like the combination of the cream cheese. I will try this again with half the cream cheese and add some cottage cheese to the cream cheese mixture along with spinach. This recipe needs something that I have not figured out yet. I am going to work with it.

When I got ready to make this for the umpteenth time the other day, I was going off the website and thought I had the wrong recipe because I've always made this in a 9x9 pan, so I pulled my paper copy and sure enough the recipe used to state a 9x9 pan.  Since we like the meat, cheese and sauce more than the pasta, I think I will continue to use the smaller pan. Whenever I have leftover chicken (of any kind...well except maybe something like BBQ)I freeze it & use it to make this.  Makes a wonderful quick dinner!

Not only is this simple to whip up it is also a crowd pleaser (children too!).  The only thing I do is that I double the recipe to go into a 9x13 casserole dish.  This is the only way I can possibly have leftovers for lunches (this is if the pan has not been licked clean though).  Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper!

Loved this.  Kids and husband also loved it.  I did add some fresh garlic, oregeno, and italian seasoning to the mix.  I also used 2 bouillon cubes instead of one.  It was ver tasty.  Will definitely keep this one.

This was good, but not great.  Need to add more seasonings.  I poached chicken in black pepper and adobo seasoning, and still not enough flavor.  Hubby didn't like it at all.

VERY good recipe, easy to make and requires simple ingredients.  My husband does not like ricotta cheese AT ALL and therefore always scrapes it off of my lasagna.  He ate every bite of his serving and was excited about having this for lunch tomorrow.  A VERY good recipe for picky kids, a weeknight, or just when you are craving something warm and filling.

This was so easy to make, and it turned out amazing!  I followed the instructions to a 'T'.  But, I got the "pre-cooked" lasagna noodles...  so you don't have to boil them.  I wasn't sure how the cream cheese would be...  but it turned out being the "secret ingredient" that made the dish!  I cooked this as part of a romantic dinner for my fiancee and I...  well, my roommate and his girlfriend came over and joined us for dinner, and between the 4 of us, we devoured the whole thing!!  :)  Thanks for this recipe...  it's definitely getting added to my repertoire

Not that this recipe needs any more great reviews, but we LOVED this creamy, delicious recipe.  Pretty easy to make.  Tips: follow some of the other reviewers' suggestions: flavour chicken with onion and garlic, use ground chicken to save time, and perhaps less sauce.  Overall - SO yummy and makes fantastic leftovers. Thanks!

I was a little concerned as to what's gonna come out of this recipe, since I was using ground chicken, but it turned out great.  I sauteed ground chicken, onions, garlic, spinach in a little olive oil on a frying pan, and then put it into the baking dish with the rest of the ingredients and added fresh mushrooms.  Simply delicious!!!

This was a unique lasagna, but probably will be one that I won't make again. It was very good, however I prefer the more traditional ricotta and ground beef recipe. But it IS fun trying new things!

My family did not care for this.  The chicken mixture was bland, despite the fact that I followed several suggestions from the reviews to add seasonings, etc.  I've been instructed to stick with "real" lasagna from now on...Thanks for sharing.

This was a very tasty, and easy to make recipe. Great for finicky kids. Mine all really liked it. I didn't have enough mozzarella cheese, so I used half mozzarella, and half swiss. It ended up being a very good combination.

Just made tonight. Husband and kids loved it. Great alternative to ground beef. I used 9x13 pan and used regular lasagna noodles and did not boil them-just layered as per recipe and put in oven for 1 hour.(since they weren't boiled) I do not like cream cheese but it makes this recipe over the top! The shredded poached chicken tasted great. I also added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the mixture. This recipe will make everyone happy!

Delicious!  I don't really care for lasagna but I LOVED this.  As always, I added a few cloves of freshly minced garlic and thinly sliced scallions to enhance the flavor (to the cream cheese mixture).  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  Make extra.  Even better the next day!

This recipe was delish!  I followed the advice of some of the others and used extra sauce.  I also used extra mozzerella because I'm a cheese freak an an extra layer of noodles on the bottom.  Even my fiance loved it, and he's picky with his lasagna (he hates ricotta).  But I'll definitely be making this lasagna again.

I made this recipe with leftover rotisserie chicken (that we made the night before) and also added a box of frozen spinach.  I also got a larger jar of spaghetti sauce.  This was really good and I got compliments from everyone.  I will definitely make this again.

I added a small package of spinach and some seasonings (garlic powder, italian seasoning, onion powder, basil, etc). I also used about 50% more sauce. Really good & easy meal.

It's a little hard to rate this recipe, because I used the basics, but then tweaked it. I really liked it the way I made it though.  I sauteed an onion, green pepper, & some garlic.  Chunked up the chicken and added that and some italian seasoning to the onion mixture to cook.  I dispensed with the bouillon cube.  And I used an 8x8 baking dish.  As for previous reviews, I didn't detect an overwhelming cream cheese taste at all. Maybe because I put extra flavors into it.

I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.  Made it twice, once with chunky sauce and once with thin and my friends preffered the chunkier sauce, but it was good both ways. I used an 8 inch dish, but will use a 9 the next time because the sauce bubbled over in the oven.  But all in all---great!

Excellent!  I made this and the Yummy Lasagna recipe for a family party and while everyone liked the other, they LOVED this.  They all said that from now on, when it's lasagna, it better be this recipe. Thanks for a great, different recipe.

this was nice! i made it with a homemade marinara sauce, which added alot. i added mushrooms & onions to the chicken mixture & next time i think i'll add some basil - it just needed a little bit more, i felt. i did like the cream cheese & mozzarella mixture, too -a nice variance. after i "tweek" it just a bit, i'll add it to my rotation! thanks :)

This was a little too rich for me (and I usually love rich foods!), but I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it -- adults and kids alike.  Even the pickiest kids loved it, so I might try making it again.

This recipe was ok, not great.  I think I'll try some of the other reviewers suggestions and bake it in a smaller pan and also add some more seasonings, and possibly more sauce.  I think once I play around with it, it will be great.  Good base.

Excellent flavor!! I wasn't sure how many lasagna noodles to use, but used 12 to make 3 layers. I agree that it might be nicer (thicker) to use a smaller pan.

I have two non-beef eaters in my family. For a recent family get-together, I tried this recipe along with the American Lasagna (also in Allrecipes). Both were great hits. I was afraid the chicken recipe was going to be dry and bland, but surprisingly, it was very cheesy and had lots of flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I needed to use leftovers with the poached chicken breasts I had,and I found this Creamy  Chicken Lasagna. Never thought that cream cheese instead of ricotta cheese would be so delicious! I added sauteed chopped crimini mushrooms with chopped garlic,and a dash of sweet red wine since I didn't have sherry. I mixed that mixture in the chicken cream cheese,with 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and mozzarella, with chicken broth that I used was from the poached chicken breasts. I didn't have lasagna noodles in my pantry but used spaghetti pasta as a substitute.  I made my own Maramara sauce,and added sliced black olives on top of the mozzarella cheese before baking,( that's the way my mom always did).I will make this again,and again,we loved it!

A bit different than the usual fare for lasagna, but I liked it.  The cream cheese element changed the dynamic of the dish, but I am a bit of a traditionalist, so I won't be substituting this for the other.  That having been said, it's worth working into a recipe rotation.

This recipe was awesome! I lived for the cream cheese, it was a great addition to the dish. I did do a few things different with it, instead of 6 pieces of lasagna pasta I used 9. I put 3 on the bottom of the baking dish. And I forgot to put aluminum foil while it was cooking in the oven which made the top layer of cheese and sauce burn a little and become hard... rookie mistake lol

Followed directions and recommendations of fellow reviewers due to health issues; low fat cream cheese, reduced fat mozzarella, and instead of chicken bouillon cubes  ( which upon reading the ingredients, just made me go YAK) I chose a vegan paste alternative instead. I gave this a 4 stars since I fussed with the original recipe of which I apologize to those who say to follow the original and then play around with it.  My family said it tasted more mexican than italian although less spicy.  I would definitely add spinach next time; however, I would blend it in the Ninja to sneak it in because my boys are that picky about GREEN stuff so I have to get creative.  I suppose I would have to add Italian seasoning also to give it the flavor they wanted. I tasted it and thought it was good. Boiling the chicken was awesome and and shredding it was actually therapeutic. Thanks for the recipe as I will try it again and take a picture as it did come out great but my husband cut into before I could snap a pic! Oh, I did us an oval glass cookware smaller than 9x13 and bigger than 8x9 with ready to go in the oven lasagna which I had to cut to fit  and it worked out nicely.  Creativity in the kitchen is all about learning, sharing, and growing  with new and awesome recipes. So thanks for putting this easy and family fun recipe to mess around with on here. Greatly appreciated from a Mom who spins with what to prepare for finicky eaters in the house. Much gratitude again because this is a clea

Really unexpectedly good. I say unexpected because of the unusual ingredients  for a lasagna, but based on the reviews I tried it. So glad I did as the family and my parents loved it. It's also easy to make.  I added parsley, basil, oregano to the cheese mixture. I also add some cottage cheese as we use that in our traditional lasagna. It's hearty and delicious.

I used 9 noodles as others did and used a 9 x 13 dish, perfect fit. I also added Italian seasoning and garlic to the chicken. And I used gruyere cheese instead of mozzarella. I  prepared it the night before and refrigerated it covered. My guests all loved it. A good change from traditional lasagne.

This is my go to recipe for the office, everyone loves it! I always get asked for this recipe. The only changes I make is the amount of cheese used, I add extra onions, bacon, or any other veggies of my liking..I also boil the chicken breast with chicken bouillon and add that same chicken broth to cream cheese mixture. Definitely recommend this recipe since nobody ever makes chicken lasagna Or at least not around here

This was a super easy lasagna and even though I think it did need a little more flavor to be a 5 star, it still made a great meal.  I did change a few things and added a little more seasonings for my liking.  I used oven ready lasagna noodles and used one size smaller pan than the 9x13, because this makes a smaller lasagna.  Instead of making the chicken bouillon and water separately, I made up extra to use to poach the chicken in.  I also added in some chopped onion and garlic to the chicken water, to add into the filling as well.  Once the chicken was done, I used the leftover water that the chicken and veggies were poached in, to add to the filling.  I also added in some parsley, italian seasonings, and some garlic powder to the filling.  Once it was done we had a salad on the side and it made a great meal.  If I make again, I would add in some spinach to the filling, because spinach would be excellent in this.  Thank you for the recipe!

First time eating chicken lasagna! I’m such a hardcore beef person but this was SOOOO much better! I even used reduced fat cheeses to make the dish healthier! I did add Italian seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder like someone recommended and it came out delicious! Perfect for cheese lovers!

Very good and easy! I used oven ready lasagna noodles and baked it for  425 degrees for 40 minutes covered with tin foil, then 20 minutes uncovered. Finished up by broiling it  for 3 minutes and let it sit for 15 minutes before serving. Sprinkled with crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese.

I've recently have cut out all processed meats & foods. And I only eat chicken & fish to be healthier. I normally make lasagna with hamburger or sausage but decided to try chicken rather than no meat. It turned out really good. My husband and I liked but I think it's going to take some getting use to on my daughter's behalf. This is a recipe that I'll try it again.

Was looking for a chicken and pasta dish that didn't need cream.  As another reviewer said, this is a good starting recipe to tweak to your own liking.    Made my own tomato pasta sauce, plus used a mix of Lasagna and Spiral pasta (using what we already had opened) and standard Colby cheese vs mozzarella.  Additional herbs used were basil, rosemary, oregano.  When cooking the chickens I also choose to make soup with the chicken water  for our entree.

Pretty good I used oven ready noodles and it worked just fine! I also added spinach and spices! It was really good! You can also use precooked frozen chicken to make it go faster! I made it in about an hour and a half total even using my short cuts!

I was surprised that the cream cheese was so good. The second time I substituted mostly ricotta and used half the cream cheese so it wasn't so fattening.  Tasted even better.

I doubled it. I added a bit of pizza spice and used vegetable soup stock as I did not have chicken.
Used the quick cook lasagna noodles as that is what I had. It was great took it to a church supper and it was gobbled right up.

Great recipe! I made it half-sized, and it makes 6 generous portions. Only modification...added a good bit of garlic and onion powder to the chicken mix, and a little mozzarella on top. This recipe is a keeper.

Didn't change a thing.  Loved it!!  Husband and 5yr old son loved it too!  The only thing I may do next time is either make more and make more layers or put in a smaller dish and create one more layer.

I thought the addition of cream cheese made this recipe a winner.  I took the advise of others and added sauteed spinach, garlic, and onions.  Will definitely make again.

I made my own bolanase sauce using veg and tomatoes, and added some mushrooms to the chicken layer and left out the stock didn't feel it needed it. I used no precook lasagne and possibly slightly under did the cooking but it smelt so good I couldn't wait any longer!

Great recipe for chicken lasagna. I basically doubled everything. Used more chicken and added celery, carrots, onions, garlic, italian seasoning, black pepper and ginger to the water to cook the chicken, then used that as the broth to go in the chicken mixture. Used two packages of cream cheese. I also added a packet of frozen chopped spinach that was defrosted and squeezed of its liquid (in the future may not need to squeeze so hard and needed more liquid). Could have added alot more seasoning though, since afterwards it was a bit bland. I used the no back noodles. Also needed much more sauce than I had put on. Overall really good easy recipe that you don't need ricotta for.

My family enjoyed this. I typically read the reviews before making a dish, so with this I made minor changes as suggested by others. I boiled the chicken with onion and garlic.  I also added spinach and parmesan to the cream cheese mixture. My picky 8 year old ate the spinach with no fuss. I will for sure make again, I may even try it with a white sauce.

I added a spinach layer and seasonings (onion, garlic, Italian seasoning)  to the chicken mixture as advised by other reviewers.  But I still found it to be a bit bland. Would much rather have a layer of ricotta.  Others at my dinner party liked it.

I wanted to like this a lot. I thought it was decent...but it's missing something. I made it exactly as the recipe states. My kids didn't really care for it either...I was the only one who ate the leftovers and I didn't even finish the whole thing.

I love this site because of all the wonderful feedback.  I don't always have the exact ingredients on hand but have learned to use the recipes as a guide.  I didn't have ricotta cheese on hand, so using cream cheese instead was a huge save!  Everyone loved it, although I did make a few alterations.  I used spaghetti as a base because I didn't have lasagna noodles and I used Rotisserie Chicken omitted the chicken flavor and added sauted onion, yellow pepper, spinach and Italian seasoning and added the cream cheese in the sauce pan when the vegies were done. then used layers to finish. I also didn't have shredded mozzarella so I used cut up string cheese and it worked great.  Don't be afraid to substitute or add it makes the dish yours!

Honestly,  I was skeptical about red sauce with chicken lasagna but OMG!!!! I sautéed green onions, mushrooms, red onions, and fresh garlic, blackened  the chicken, and added it to the mixture and topped with mozzarella and cheddar and I received Sooooo many compliments... This dish is light and refreshing,  which is a different spin as regular lasagna can be heavy.  I have saved this recipe and even made the filling, chicken included to a buttery pie crust, lattice the top, brushed with egg mixture and the family loved it. .. I did add broccoli as well. . A definite keeper.  Thank you

I have made it at least 2 dozen times.  It was the deciding factor in my daughter abandoning her 7 year stint as a vegetarian.  But I do change it a little, making it larger...more layers, twice as much chicken, and the sauce maybe a bit more.  it's a little different every time.  One of the best spaghetti sauces to use with this recipe is vodka sauce....but this is a dish that ALWAYS GETS RAVES!

I added 1/2 lb of fresh mushrooms & 1 can of rotel tomatoes. Yes I will definitely make it again. It was quick and easy to make  at a time when I needed to find something to cook in a hurry.

I really liked this recipe (although I would not call it one for dieters)! I boiled the chicken with a bay leaf and some salt and garlic. I also sauteed a little bit of onion (1/4 cup), garlic, and about 2 cups of fresh chopped spinach in olive oil, and added all that to the cream cheese mixture. This was not enough for a 9 x 13-inch pan, so I used the next smaller size that I had, 9 x 5. I used Newman's Own Marinara which is a little tangy. Nice flavors overall, and even my picky husband liked it!

I made this today for my picky family- and they loved it! Even my husband, who doesn't like cream cheese ate it. I used no boil noodles and they worked like a charm (I added half a jar of water to my pasta sauce to help them cook properly). I will definitely make this again, I may try adding sautéed onion or spinach for added flavor. Overall, great family meal served with garlic toast.

I loved it made it for a dinner party and my guess loved it. It is now my favorite lasagna recipe. I added chopped spinach to the chicken, sauted onion and crushed garlic and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  It was very good.  I will double the recipe to make a 13x9 to have extra for the freezer.  Yummy

This is a great recipe to start with but I took others advice and added mushroom and onions. I also added Italian spice and garlic. I did not have enough cream cheese but added laughing cow herb and garlic. It was delicious and will be making this again.

I had multiple guests tell me this was one of the best lasagnas they have ever tasted! That meant a lot, because I am no chef by any means. I added red bell peppers on the bottom layer, spinach on the middle layer and lots of yellow diced onions on the top layer under the sauce. I used other reviewers advice and added italian seasoning to the chicken, but wasn't sure if that made a difference because I had no point of reference. I also added a little finely sliced, uncured pancetta on top and that added amazing flavor and texture! Great recipe.

I made this ALMOST as is. I used no boil noodles instead. And then used almost 2 jars of sauce. Just because the no boil noodles uses up the liquid. Over all it was pretty dang good! The only thing I think I will do next time is put some basil in the mix of cream cheese. Thanks for the yummyness

I really loved the recipe and so did my 5 year old twins.  I gave it 4 stars because my husband didn't care for it and I made a few changes.  I took the advise of other reviewers.  I poached the chicken in chicken broth, onions, and garlic. Next time I will also add a little salt.  I hate chicken that has no seasoning.  I will definitely make again.  Very tasty!!

I have never had cream cheese lasagna before and it was very tasty!
Turned out quite rich but very very flavorful-I used ground chicken (since that is what I had).
I will definitely make this again.
I added sautéed onion & fresh mushrooms to the cream cheese & chicken mixture.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it. I added jalapeños to spice it up but would have been amazing without also.

Disappointing.  I was really excited to try this after reading all of the praise reviews, but surprised that it was less than average.  Don't know why others liked it so much and my family and I did not.  It really turned out more like a mediocre chicken casserole, Italian-style, rather than a lasagna.  Won't be making this one again.

Delicious and so easy. Since I am gluten free, I used corn tortillas in place of lasagna noodles. Normally I miss the pasta, but not in my GF version. Even my husband loved it.

While as written this recipe makes an average meal, but with a few modifications it could be great.  For example, if you are stewing the chicken, why not use the broth instead of using water and bouillon?  Also, definitely add some spices:  Italian seasoning, garlic, onions, green peppers, etc.  I also used 9 noodles and a little more broth with the chicken & cheese mixture.  With these modifications I would give it 4, maybe 4 1/2 stars.

I really liked this lasagna but I was the only one in the family:(  That is why it only gets 3*! The  family thought the cream cheese overpowered the dish. Personally, it was a nice change. As recomended by others, I added green pepper, mushrooms and a bit of spices.

This is good but error on my part probably made it not as good as it could have been. I added too many noodles and made it in a small pan. It needs less noodles than ur average lasagna. The filling rocks tho, I would just follow the instructions and layer it like suggested.

This was delicious. In fact, my fiance was it was "the best thing" I've ever made him. I did add a second bouillon cube and some seasonings to the cream cheese mixture, and seasoned the chicken very well. In the future I may add some sauteed veggies to kick it up a notch, but it was delicious and easy as is!

I added some onion powder and garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture. I also add some chopped fresh spinach to it. This was amazing!!!!!!!!!! I will be saving this one to make again and again. Can't wait to make it for company someday!

My family and I try new recipes constantly trying to find the "wow" recipes.  This has such a great flavor!  There are no flavor adjustments needed, this recipe is great as is.  The only thing we do different is double it so it will fit nicely in an oversized lasagna pan for leftovers!

I've been making this recipe for quite a few years now and it's always a hit. I've rated it 4 stars because it needs more or else it's a bit bland. I always use herb & garlic cream cheese, parmesan cheese, lots of garlic/peper and salt, and add cut up fresh mushrooms. I also slice up chicken and grille it instead of boil it. Still one of the most popular dishes in my house though!

I didn't have tomato sauce so I mixed some ricotta with tomato juice. It was delicious! Also I used flavored cream cheese-- I think it was garlic and herb. Perfect dish to double the recipe and freeze.

Made this recipe as written and found it to be very yummy.  The cream cheese is the best in it.  Sure beats ricotta and cottage cheese.  Loved it.  Will make it but will switch the boneless chicken with a mixture of ground chicken and mild Italian Sausage or turkey sausage and fry it up like the beef version add the bouillon mixed with water and some onion etc next time for a bit of a change.  This recipe goes in my recipe box for sure.

I have previously bought the frozen chicken lasagna but not anymore! This recipe was delicious and my husband wanted 2nds, so it is a keeper.  I did use more mozzarella and used a nice chunky spaghetti sauce. Also used 8 oven ready lasagna noodles.  Yumm...

My husband gave this a 4.5 rating.  I added at least three TBSP. of minced garlic with half a chopped onion, which I sauted together.  I also put in about 8 oz. of thawed, squeeze dried spinach into the cheese/chicken mixture.  I sprinkled in some Italian seasoning and thought it turned out well.  I cooked it in a 11X8 inch pan.  Next time, I might use ricotta or cottage cheese instead of cream cheese.

This was my first time making lasagna, and my husband and I both loved it! I cut up a few onions and added a few spices, and used herbal cream cheese rather than plain! A great and easy recipe!

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!!! I honestly make this recipte ONCE A WEEK. My fiance is so picky and he doesnt care for anything pasta related and doesnt like ricotta cheese. He is ALWAYS requesting that I make this.. I stummbled across this many months ago and have been making it once a week since.   I pretty much follow the recipe AS IS with a few modifications.  --I use a small pan with 9 noddles to make a really hearty lasagna.  --I dont like the taste of boiled chicken, so I grill it up in a pan with some Olive Oil and Montreal Steak Seasoning!  --I use reduced fat cream cheese and it makes NO DIFFERENCE in the flavor--I originally only used REGULAR, as I was hesitant about the reduced fat altering the taste--I kid you not, it makes no difference.  -I throw about a pinch of dried oregano into the chicken mixture.  --I make my own sauce comprised of crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, and garlic-Yum!  I love the simplicity of this recipe and how there arent so many ingredients with flavors getting lost!

I know that other reviewers said they couldn't tell that there wasn't any ricotta, but my family definitely could.  The flavor was fine, but the cream cheese made this a bit too dense for us.

I added the sauteed onions, garlic, Italian seasoning, etc. that most others suggested.  I also added a bit of spinach for color.  The taste is great...if you like cream cheese in your lasagna.  It's a keeper recipe but from now on I'll be using ricotta cheese instead.

Just finish eating this and it was great. I follow the advise of the other reviews. I actually baked mine in foil because all my baking dishes was broke. Anyways it was really good and I roasted my garlic and added the onions spinach. Husband loved it, and his the cook so this was a great success for me.

Great base recipe. May try adding peppers or mushrooms next time. Very easy to make and better than other lasagna recipes I've tried. May substitute light cream cheese next time too.

Good.  Not amazing, but worthy of being made and eaten on a semi-normal basis.  I did add sauteed onions and green peppers to my portion (not the kids) and will probably add some garlic or something next time to give it even more flavor, but give it a try, you'll like it!

I also added garlic, italian seasoning, onion powder and seasoned salt to the chicken water, then used this to dissolve the bouillon cube after the chicken was done.  This gives it great flavor.

Loved it! Per other reviews I added some Italian Seasoning and garlic powder. I think the next time I make it I'll cook the chicken in the slowcooker throughout the day (easier to shred and more tender). I also used the no boil noodles to cut down on time which worked fine!

yum!  my whole family licked this up.  i followed the ingredients exactly. the only thing i changed was cutting up the chicken instead of shredding it and i just added 2/3 of the spaghetti sauce to the chicken/cream cheese/moz cheese mixture instead of adding them separate.  very easy to make and great tasting!  thanks for the recipe.  this will go into the monthly schedule!

I would give this a 5-star but I modified it too much. But..my modifications were awesome. I used fully cooked spicy chicken sausages w/peppers instead of plain chicken breast, onions, and used chedder cheese because I was out of mozzarella. Also added some garlic,1/3 fat cream cheese and chicken broth. One of the best lasagna's on here

My kids ate it!  They've never eaten lasagna - they refuse.  They really liked this.  I added garlic powder, oregano, s&p and any reduced fat products I could sub in.  I still think it needed a little something more, hubby agreed.  If I make it again I'll put spinach on it (not on the kid's side!).

This is a wonderful, basic recipe that is easily altered to taste. I use it with no-boil lasagna noodles and add 2 gloves of garlic. It's also delicious with spinach to give it some texture (it can be a bit runny). I also recommend using ground beef instead of chicken for variety (use beef bullion). My husband is crazy about this recipe!

Thank you for making my first try at lasagna a hit! My boyfriends mom makes the greatest beef lasagna, so no way am I gonna try to out do that! I increased my ingredients slightly so I could use 9 noodles to fill out my 9x13.  I also used shredded cheddar since I was out of mozz.  I was going to post a pic, but my knife ruined the presentation :( next time I am going to try making a buffalo chicken lasagna with hot sauce and jalapenos :) yum! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this lasagna!  My picky, picky husband will eat it.  He will not eat regular lasagna because he wont eat cottage cheese or ricotta cheese.  I have made it for a few gatherings and everyone has raved about it.

Definetly not my favorite lasagna.  From now on, I'm just going to make my standard recipe.  I tweaked it a little, though, so maybe that's my own fault.  I added sauteed onion, garlic, and a bell pepper like other reviewers said.  I'm not sure if it was that or the chicken boullion flavor I didn't like but what ever it was, I really didn't care for it.  Plus, I've decided I don't like the texture, with just the cream cheese.  I like the ricotta texture much better.  This one was too smooth for me.  But maybe that's just me.  My husband liked it.

I made this recipe exactly as stated... My husband thought it was missing something so he gave it a 3, I thought it was fine the way it was and would give it a 5 so I'm giving it a 4... Next time I will take my husbands suggestion and add onion, garlic and maybe other fresh veggies...

This was fabulous! I did a little tweaking after reading some reviews. I added some sauted onions, peppers and garlic. Added a little spinach and italian seasoning too. I used all of the cream cheese and we thought it was just right. Thanks for the recipe. It's nice to have something a little different.

I didn’t have any chicken prepared so I tried this with lean ground turkey. WOW! This was so good! This was the first lasagna I have ever made and my husband was really surprised. He loved it and now asks for it all the time. The cream cheese is such a unique flavor and makes it really creamy. TRY IT, its easy, quick, and really good!!!

This was quite tasty and fairly simple to prepare.  I also added some peppers, onions, garlic and made enough for a 9x13 (but using the same amount of cream cheese).  Thanks!

I added spinach and onion sauteed in garlic butter. Was yummy, but with out my alteration I think this would have been a little plain for me. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This was yummy. I used an 8 inch square pyrex dish and filled it up with 3 layers. It only took 1/2 hour to bubble up. I used 2% motz cheese and lowfat cream cheese. Next time I'll use different noodles and no fat cream cheese to make a casserole instead of a lasagna. Faster and easier.

This was a different lasagna to be sure, but maybe a bit rich.  My guests loved it, but next time I would add more vegetables and less cream cheese.  I give it a second run.

Although I usually make a recipe exactly as it states the first time around and then tweak it in the future if I want, I found myself modifying this from the get-go.  Boiling chicken in plain water isn't very flavorful, so I added some chicken boullion granules, pepper, oregano, basil, garlic, and pasta seasoning.  I mixed the cheese mixture together, and I didn't add the full amount of cream cheese as per reviews (but I think it would have been ok with all of it), but I added more mozzerella.  After I shredded the chicken I mixed it with about 1/3 cup of the pasta sauce.  Then I mixed it with the cheese mixture.  I also made extra chicken and noodles so I could make 3 layers.  Added more cheese on top as well.  I love chicken lasagna, but I think I prefer the kind with a white sauce instead of red.  Overall though it was pretty good and I would make it again.

cut recipe in half for a 9x9 pan.  used 7-8 noodles, divided for 3 layers. was a nice change and all liked from 3.5-4.5 stars. did use 12 oz cream cheese and that was too much- too rich, but will use less next time and maybe with a combination of cottage cheese.  also, mixed spices and pinch of cinnamon with cream cheese mixture.

Good recipe. Easy too.  I think it could benefit with some vegies such as spinach, artichokes etc.  Oh and I like Emerils, Roasted garlic sauce for this.

I liked this very much...would probably use half cream cheese and half ricotta or cottage cheese next time (cream cheese was a tad overpowering) but otherwisw the whole family enjoyed.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  I wanted some more chicken recipes and I like it.  I will try a bit less cream cheese next time.  Using the whole block made the lasagna a bit too heavy.  Other than that, very tasty!

This recipe had just enough tang from the cream cheese (one of my favorites) to make it amazing.  However, it needed more cheese as it seemed a bit dry.  Then again, my husband and I love cheese.

This is the best lasagna recipe I have found on this site.  It does take a lot of prep time (due to shredding the chicken), but it's worth it.  I used fat free cheese products and it still had a lot of flavor.

I made this a s stated in one pan and with the addition of onion , peppers, mushroon, spinach in another pan. I added italian seasoning to both. My kids loved the plain batch and my husband and I liked the second batch okay. This is one of those recipes that we will eat all of it as leftovers , but not be dying to make another batch too soon. The kids will probably get theirs again though since it was easy and they loved it.

Wonderful recipe! Five starts because my modifications were pretty minor. I simply added about one tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder and oregeno to the water that the chicken was boiled in and then used 1/4 cup of that water to mix with the cheese/chicken mixture. My husband and kids asked for seconds and thirds!

This was really delicious and has provided a few days' worth of leftovers that I can't wait to eat.  The only change I made was to sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top with the mozzarella.  I also think it would be good with an herbed cream cheese, instead of plain.  Has anyone tried that?

This recipe worked to create the greatest chicken lasagna I've ever had!  My husband and 3 children absolutely adored it!  It's hard as a mother of a 4 and a 6 year old to get them to eat pretty much anything, I didn't have to tell them anything, they finished and asked for more.  This dish is even better the day after!!!

Boiled the chicken in water with onion powder, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, and salt for some flavor.  Then I added pepper, parsley, oregano, and a small handful of 3-cheese blend to the mixture.  Tasted pretty good to us, so I'll add it to the recipe box.  The chicken was a bit of an odd texture in it.  I might try this with ground turkey sometime too.

My hubby, and eight children, really liked this recipe. Dh said he preferred this recipe over all other lasagnas, I've made.   I, on the other hand, wasn't crazy about it after the first few bites.  I found the cream cheese overpowering.  Next time, I will use half cream cheese/half cottage cheese.  I added italian seasoning, ground pepper and garlic, but it could have definately still used more garlic.  Something else seemed to be missing, as well.  I'm going to keep working on this one!

Based on all the reviews I thought this would be really good, but I was disappointed.  It is really lacking flavor. The only alterations I made to the recipe was adding spinach as other reviewers had suggested.  I wouldn't make this again.

I took others' suggestions and added spinach.  I also added more sauce, fresh basil, crushed garlic, and red pepper flakes.  The red pepper flakes gave the dish a nice bite.  I used whole wheat noodles, fat free cream cheese, and reduced fat moz. cheese . . . and it tasted great!  I agree with the others, this is a good base recipe.

Good basic recipe, But next time I will change a few things. The Cream Cheese is overpowering, cut that to 4 oz. or just use small curd cottage cheese like traditional Lasagne's. I also added parsley, italian seasoning & pepper to add more flavor!

This was really good. I didn't have the right cheese so I used 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in the filling and colby jack on top. Still was great, even reheated.

Everyone really like this and my husband asked if we could make it again this week. We'll make it again with spinach and mushrooms (we made it per the recipe last time). Edited: I've made this a ton now and it's still enjoyed. Wish it made more. May do it 1.5 times in the future (7 people). Also, made this in the crockpot today with no boil noodles on low for 4 hours! Thanks!

I love it.  I have made it many times and the best part is how easy it is to make and how great it tastes.  It is a wonderful recipe for company because everyone assumes that you have spent hours on making the lasgna when you haven't.  The last time I served it everyone was asking for the recipe.  It is wonderful and this will be a standard dish in my home.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I love this! Definitely a keeper recipe. My only adjustment was subbing half of the cream cheese with cottage cheese because that's what I had on hand. It tasted great and was definitely creamy enough. Thanks!

Was better tasting than it looked - a bit too soupy. Next time I would use less water. It was a good recipe but more of a comfort food and "stick to your gut" kind of food. Heavy!

A definite family favorite.  I add a thawed box of frozen chopped spinach and some italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  Delicious and sneaky way to get more veggies in the kids' diets.

This has become my official "recipe to impress."  It is a great dish to make and freeze for others.  I made it for a friend who had hand surgery and a neighbor after her first baby.  When I make it at home, I use low-fat ingredients and it is still a hit.

This was okay.  For some reason ours had kind of a filmy, oily texture in the sauce.  I boiled the noodles in the broth from the chicken, maybe it was from this? We weren't crazy about the creamy sauce but it was a nice recipe if you like that.  We are always trying different things and this was interesting.

Great!! My family said this was the best lasagna that I have ever made! And i would have to agree. I did take some users advice on adding sauteed mushrooms and onions, and adding those two items just made this recipe. This recipe's  a keeper!!

Good stuff. I, too was skeptical about cream cheese in lasagna, but for me it made the meal. I only change I'll make is to use less sauce. Mine was very runny!

Tasty!  I sauteed garlic, onions and mushrooms and added that into the mix.  The chicken was delicious and the cream cheese is better than you'd think in this dish.   I'll make it again!

I thought this had a bit too much cream cheese in it for my liking, but my picky husband & son thought it was pretty good so I gave it 4 stars. I used 3/4 cup water because 1/4 didn't seem like enough. I also used a precooked rotissoerie chicken & mushrooms on half.

Wow, this was good!  The changes I made to suit my likings were that I used ground chicken, mushrooms, onions, cajun seasoning, italian seasoning and more noodles then called for. It was delicous.  I'm going keep this in my regular rotation!

This was very tasty!  I have to admit I was wary of the cream cheese, but it worked perfectly!  I'm not a big ricotta fan and I thought it would taste like that in the lasagna, but it didn't and it tasted even better the next day!

This was very nice.  I used chicken thighs which I cut up and fried in olive oil with 3 cloves of crushed garlic and used a really good tomatoe and basil pasta sauce and it turned out really good.  I will definately make this again in the same way.

This was just ok for me, i thought it would have more taste then it did, it was kinda bland. Maybe if you add some spices to the cream cheese/chicken mixture it would taste  better, but i don't plan on making this again.

Very yummy! I didn't have any regular spaghetti sauce on hand so I used a jar of vodka cream sauce that I had in the pantry. Turned out great and hubby has asked for it again!

This was a great recipe.  I did not have enough spagetti sauce to make the recipe as suggested but I really enjoyed it and will make again.  I folled some suggestions and added onion, galic and also added pine nuts to add a little texture.  Great Recipe thanks!!

This recipe is a good start to anything you want to add to it. I just added garlic but you can throw in veggies or mushrooms or even use a alfredo sauce.

An interesting change from traditional lasagne, but will probably reduce the amount of tomato sauce and add some mushrooms and spinach or other veggies as other reviews have done.

Great recipe. I had zucchini in the fridge, so I lightly sauted that and added it to the chicken mixture. This was easy to make and everyone liked it.

this was okay.  i will eat it, but didn't love it.  i didn't add the boullion cube - i was afraid of it being salty.  i shredded the sticky rotisserie chicken on this site & added it.  it was quick & easy but not really good.  maybe add mushrooms & a green veggie?  zucchini or asparagus or broccoli?  may use the concept again, but not this exact recipe.  it was just okay.

Very good!  I took the advice of others, and used a larger jar of pasta sauce.  I also topped it with grated parmesan cheese before baking.  Yummy

My entire family enjoyed this recipe even my picky eater. I too did not sense "too strong" a cream cheese taste but I softened it well and really blended it with the other ingredients.

I think it could use a little more spaghetti sauce...too bad the jars don't come a little larger! I think if I were to double the recipe I would use three jars. I think that adding mushrooms would be great...

It was okay, but it wasn't worthy of five stars.  I agree with the person that posted if they had the ingredients and wanted to get rid of them you could make this, but I am not clammoring to make this again anytime soon.

I must admit that I was scared to make this because the ingredients are unusual together but it turned out pretty good.  Not a five star but a recipe I might use again if trying to get rid of those ingredients in my fridge.

I also used an 8x8 inch pan to make this lasagna; it worked out quite well. It's a nice change from traditional lasagna. I will definitely make this again sometime and try oven-ready lasagna noodles; boiling the lasagna was the most irritating part. Use a chunky spaghetti sauce (I used onion and garlic sauce) for more flavor.

Good! I added some garlic powder and dried basil and oregano to the chicken mixture, which I think added something to the overall flavor. I liked the cream cheese(I don't usually care for ricotta). Will make again.

This was not bad, but nothing great.  I will use this as a base and replace the cream cheese with ricotta, add some Parmesan/Romano and make my own sauce.

I made this for a girl's night in and everyone loved it.  It was very easy and really yummy!  I prepared the chicken the evening before and added a little garlic salt to it for some extra taste.

I made this for my new guy roomates, and some girl friends...they ALL loved it, and it was gone fast! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13in pan, and it worked out great. The only thing was that it didn't set up very well...kind of sloppy and mushy, but still tasted great! Also added some italian seasonings and parsley to the chicken/cheese mixture, maybe next time will try spinach also!

I really enjoyed making this recipe. It was very easy, and my boyfriend was so impressed. I chose to use Newman's Own Marinara sauce and it was a nice smooth blend.

Very good recipe. I used no-boil lasagna noodles and it worked fine. I will use an 8x8 from now on like the other reviewers said.  
Thanks Caroline.

This was so wonderful!  Definately my new favorite!  I did use the 8 x 8 pan and added some Italian seasonings and garlic salt as suggested in other reviews but thank you- I will be making this again soon!
