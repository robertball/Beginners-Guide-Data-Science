Great if you make these changes- used olive oil instead of spray,browned the chicken, removed it from the skillet and deglazed the pan with white wine(instead of broth), added the shallots and garlic, then the tarragon, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of light cream plus a roux(butter and flour)to thicken it a bit. Put the chicken back in and cooked a couple minutes on each side turning once. Healthy is ok for salads- call me old fashioned,I am.

I made this tonight, though I oven roasted the chicken separately -- using only the juices for the sauce, plus some extra chicken broth. I also used half and half instead of cream, dry tarragon, and a little flour to thicken it.  The sauce was delicious. I'll be using this recipe a lot.  Thanks!

NOTE!  You should NOT use cooking spray on a non-stick pan; it can build up a residue that could cause peeling. If your nonstick pan sticks, that might be why.  The recipe sounds good, but is very high in sodium. I'd suggest using low-salt or homemade stock.

This was really good. I browned the chicken in olive oil instead of the cooking spray and went heavy on the (salt free) lemon pepper seasoning. I also substituted half and half for the light cream and 1/2 tbs. dried marjoram for the fresh tarragon, just because that's what I had. The sauce wasn't thick enough for my liking, so I dissolved 2 tbs cornstarch and water and mixed it in the sauce. Good flavorful dinner!

This was restaurant quality.  I used some of the other raters suggestions - such as using 1/2 & 1/2 and adding butter and flour to thicken the sauce up.  I didn't have shallots so I used onions instead.  I also marinated my chicken in a lemon pepper marinade and then added the extra marinade to the sauce mixture.  I doubled the cream and stock and let it simmer for around 20 minutes so that we would have enough sauce to serve it how I wanted.  I served it with Linguine and poured the extra sauce over it.  Nice change from Chicken Parm and Pasta.  Even my 8-year old loved it!!!

This recipe surprised me! I enjoyed it thoroughly as well as my boyfriend (who doesn't indulge in healthy foods much). As an alternative to shallots, I diced red onions which turned out great. For my next try, I will add more heavy cream to have a creamier sauce.

I agree with a previous poster regarding this recipe. One should *never* use cooking spray on any type of non-stick cookware! Depending upon the brand and type of the non-stick surface, a lot can (and will) happen. A chemical reaction does occur, and the result could lead to the person ingesting some of the materials from the non-stick pan itself! (This is also why everyone should toss out any non-stick surfaced pan they have that has scratches on the surface.) I realize the author of this recipe was most likely trying to reduce the caloric content, to add to its appeal - but for goodness sakes! What harm could 1 tablespoon of olive oil do? The addition of the oil, spread out among 4 servings, would add only 25-40 calories per serving (depending upon the type, of course). Not to mention, as another reviewer suggested, that the oil would help in the  browning process, which of course would then lead to a better presentation. I'm giving this recipe 1 star, because I like the idea of adding light cream to chicken broth, along with the fresh tarragon. It also sounds like a great (and fast!) way to prepare chicken on a busy night! However, I cannot condone the idea of using non-stick cooking spray with a non-stick cooking surface; this is an extremely unsafe cooking "tip."

Awesome recipe. I pounded my chicken breasts a bit to flatten, browned them in canola oil.  I used 1-1/2 cups low-sodium broth which I boiled to slightly reduce and then added 1/2 cup plus a dash more of heavy cream.  To thicken the sauce, I added a tablespoon of lemon juice which thickens cream in a heartbeat. I also increased the tarragon too. Everyone loved this...no leftovers at all!

Loved this recipe!  Highly recommend doubling the sauce and serving with a pasta such as penne, bow tie or something else that will 'hold' the sauce'.

I breaded the chicken lightly with flour, lemon pepper and garlic seasoning.  Fried in olive oil in a fairly hot pan, set chicken aside.  Added a Tbsp of butter and a tsp of additional flour and whisked until flour is slightly browned.  Deglazed pan with the stock and added all the other ingredients and put ckicken back into pan to finish cooking on a medium low heat. I turned every couple minutes (my breast pieces were pretty thick) to coat the chicken while it finished cooking.

You may need to add more stock or cream (1/2 in half in my case) if the sauce is thickens too much or starts to brown.

I'm making this again tonight, by request - my husband loves it.  I did make one change however; I used Philadelphia cooking cream (plain) instead of the cream - adds great richness.  I serve it over brown rice and a green veggie on the side - yummy!

We love this recipe! I can't stop making this. It's a hit. But, I use whatever onion I have instead of shallots. I also use whatever milk I have or evaporated canned milk. I've used fresh tarragon once and I prefer it but I also have dry tarragon in the cabinet and it's fine.

Very tasty!! Follow the rules about not spraying a non-stick pan, but as for the dish itself, very flavorful and easy to make.  Like to couple with side dish of broccolini.  didn't have chicken broth, so I fudged it with some boullion and water, added a little extra boullion into the sauce for some extra flavor.

Served to my Gourmet dinner club members. Very yummy but I found the sauce a bit too runny so added a little flour to thicken.

A recipe worthy to serve a king.  I used 1/2  package of Costco's cooked chicken breast for two of us but made a full recipe of sauce.  I used more cream more shallots and more tarragon.  Just delicious! Could use a bit of flour to thicken sauce.

I've never made a bad review but this was way too salty.  I couldn't taste any of the flavors but salt from the lemon pepper seasoning.  We actually didn't eat it and I made a simple alfredo sauce instead.

This was very good. I used olive oil to brown the chicken and then removed it to the oven to keep warm. I used onions and added them and the garlic to saute. Added sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic and then deglazed the pan with the chicken stock. I let it reduce to half and added the cream and reduced again. Added the breasts back to finish cooking.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I made changes to add more sauce and thicken the sauce and serve it over pasta or rice. I usually use onions instead of shallots, I add a twice the garlic bcuz my family loves garlic and I double the liquid ingredients to have more sauce and make an olive oil or butter roux to thicken it, for the amount I need to thicken I will use between 1/2-3/4C. of roux, depending on my mood I will also add mushrooms or red bell pepper. when it's done I serve it over egg noodles or rice with broccoli and garlic bread, I usually top it with some fresh grated parmesan and/or asiago cheese, it is delicious!! My family loves it!

Made this for 2 and low sodium. 6 chicken strips were just right for 2 servings. Seasoned with Penzey's Florida Seasoned Pepper. Low sodium broth, 2% milk and used roux to thicken. This was easy and fast. Served with no salt microwave brown rice and chopped lettuce.

Tried it and it was delicious! Took the suggestions of other posters of deglazing pan with broth and reducing with that and cream to create creamier, more flavorful sauce. Goes great with brown rice!
