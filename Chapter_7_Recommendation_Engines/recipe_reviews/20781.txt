Not bad dish... the only thing I suggest is to go to a real Italian deli and get REAL procuitto!! Make sure it's imported from Italy (it will be saltier so cut down a little on the added salt).  I've tried using both kinds (cheap and expensive procuitto) and it was definitely better with the good stuff!!

This is a wonderful, very authentic version of veal saltimbocca, deserving of five stars. I am always amazed when reviewers completely change the recipe and then rate it low, as though they made it as described and it wasn't good. This recipe requires real prosciutto and is better with fresh sage, which can grow outdoors all year in most of the USA. Try it without loading it with cheese -- it's a delicate dish.  Maybe a little Parmesan sprinkled on top before serving.

I LOVE this recipe.  The flavors go so well together, and making it gave me great ideas on how to experiment with other dishes.  The rolls look so pretty too, it is a good recipe for company.  Thickly chop up some summer squash and zucchini, add them to the simmer towards the end, and then serve all with tri-colored pasta coated with extra virgin olive oil.  YUM!  Thank you Sue!

This was delicious.  I didn't roll the chicken, but instead placed the prosciutto on top of the chicken.  That way I didn't have to worry about the roll coming undone, or the toothpicks.  It turned out wonderful.  I also added some fresh mozzarella on top.  Thanks for the post.

This was delicious!  Listening to other reviews, I did not add any salt and I put provolone inside the rolls.  I would make another recommendation, too.  When the chicken is browned, I would remove it from the pan, use some of the wine to de-glaze, then add the cornstarch (I use flour) to make a roux to begin the sauce.  Then add the rest of the wine and some chicken broth.  Cook until the sauce starts to thin and return chicken to pan.

This is an awesome recipe - very tasty.  Everyone loved these.  A single one of these is much more filling that what you would think. I used the same amount of ingredients called for, but spread it over 8 pieces of chicken.  I doubled the wine/sauce - when I realized how good it was, I knew everyone would want extra.  The key is having the chicken pounded very thin - I was able to roll these without toothpicks. Then I moved them to the pan and cooked them well on the bottom where the roll is seamed before turning - this ensured that they stayed together.  After that, I was able to turn them onto the other sides to finish cooking.

This is a VERY flavorful dish.  (If you don't like salty, be sure not to add any salt, as the prosciutto is quite salty.) The resulting sauce was excellent over angel hair pasta.  The sage really adds nice flavor.

This recipe is delicious - especially with added mushrooms!  I also changed a few things to cut down on the fat content.  For 3 chicken breasts I mixed 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil with 1 Tablespoon minced garlic.  I brushed this on both sides of the chicken then sprinkled both sides with black pepper - no salt (the prosciutto has enough salt).  I then wrapped one piece of prosciutto around each chicken breasts - I didn't roll up the chicken.  I pan fried the chicken in 2 tablespoons of butter until brown on both sides.  I then removed the chicken from the pan, deglazed the pan with about half of the white wine, added one can of sliced mushrooms and cooked for a little then added the rest of the wine.  I then put the chicken back in the pan, covered it and simmered until the chicken was done. To thicken the liquid I mixed 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch with 1 1/2 tsp cold water then added to the pan.  I also added a little chicken broth to make more of the yummy gravy.  Spoon the mushrooms and gravy over the chicken and it is delicious!!!

I would cut back on the salt next time, but otherwise this was a great dish.  It makes for a beautiful plate as well.

This had a really great wonderful flavor!  The only changes I made was instead of rolling the prosciutto in the breasts, I pan fried the breasts, then put the prosciutto on top, and then a slice of mozzarella on top of that and let it melt and get gooey.  I will definitely be making this again!!

This was just lovely with a few minor changes I made the second time around. Flattened the chicken, seasoned and added prosciutto (this is classic, don't sub w/ ham) and then folded over once and pan seared in oil. Once brown but still raw inside, remove chicken & add the fresh sage to the pan, sort of frying it. Sage really comes out when you release those natural oil... no bitterness. Finish the sauce and THEN add the chicken back to simmer. Made some stuffing with this to go with the sage flavor. REALLY REALLY GREAT DINNER... I used to hate sage.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice now and the second time I had some provolone cheese and I put a slice in with the other ingredients.  It was wonderful.

Salty. If I had to do over again, I would not add any additional salt to the recipe. The proscuitto takes care of it. Husband doesn't like sage very much but I do and thought the recipe was great. He thought there needed to be cheese added to this. He liked the other version I made better (see reviews). Anyway, this looked beautiful on a plate when you slice into the breast. I could see using this recipe as an appetizer, small slices on a tray maybe with toasted pine nuts tossed on top.

this is very similar to another recipe i've tried before, except it had asparagus rolled up inside as well. it was good! i'm not good at pounding the chicken out thin enough, so my rolls kind of came un-done - which was easily solved by holding them together with toothpicks. just have to remember to remove them before serving!

I skipped the sage in this recipe, and it still turned out great. I browned the rolls in 1 tbsp of olive oil + 1 tbsp of butter. After browning, I dumped out excess fat before deglazing with about 1/2 cup of wine. I then added about 3/4 cup of low salt chicken broth and simmered for 10 minutes before throwing in 1 1/2 c. of zuchini (chunked up) and simmering for 5 more minutes.
I removed the meat and zucchini from the pan and added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce-and served everything over farfalle pasta.
I used real Italian proscuitto!

This recipe was great change of pace from the regular, "bland", chicken breast.  I used "Italian" prosciutto from Costco. This recipe was very tasty and my wife said it was "fine dining" quality. I will definetly make this again!

This was good!  However, I made it for 2, but I did not change the ingredients of the sauce part and I'm glad I didn't!!!  There's a nice amount to put on the chicken after you cut it up and it's a very nice flavorful sauce.

FYI - I also tried it with chicken thighs but it came out too greasy.

This was a great recipe.  I added thyme and oregano to the spice mixture.  Pretty easy to make, but a bit time consuming (preparation).  And it took a little longer than specified to cook the chicken through.  Served with rice, and it was a big hit.

Very tasty, but too garlicky. We followed the recipe to a T and would make the following changes: half the garlic and use twine instead of toothpicks for better browning on all sides (seal in moisture, too).

This was really tasty.  I used much less garlic, butter and oil and thought it came out great.  The prep time was more like a half-hour for me though, and I cook every night.

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I are hooked.  1 recommendation....while the chicken is simmering use a spoon to sort of baste the chicken breasts.  My first attempt turned out a little dry.  I also tossed some mushrooms into the sauce, and found them to be a wonderful addition.

It was verry good, but the proscuitto ham made it a bit too salty.  I rolled it with a spear of asparagus in the centre which added a nic touch of green.  We are not really rice fans, but I served it (with the sauce as suggested) on a bed of wild and brown rice with butter, chopped green onions and frozen petite peas.

I listened to another reviewer and did not roll the chicken breasts.  After cooking in a skillet I layered the chicken with a couple pieces of spinach, a slice of prosciutto, and a slice of mozzarella.I also added some lemon juice to the white wine sauce.  I didn't want a thick sauce and did not use any cornstarch. This recipe was delicious! Served it with white rice.

Great recipe and very easy.  My 19 year old loved this.  I served this with fresh steamed spinach and poured sauce over chicken, spinach and pasta.  Slice the chicken on a diagonal and fan out for a pretty presentation.

Easy and very tasty.  The flavor of the sauce is wonderful.  I had ham that I wanted to use up, but I cannot wait to try with good prosciutto.  I did not roll up the chicken but left the pieces flat and placed the ham on top, then added a little mozzerella.   The brown bits and sauce were the best!  Served over a bed of pasta.  DH asked me to add this to our list of regular favorites.

I made these tonight and they turned out great. Only difference I did was I used chicken tenders and marinated them in italian dressing so I did not use the olive oil.

This was very good.  I made it as written with just a couple changes.  I added some mushrooms with the wine(be careful not to add them to hot liquid though because they will pop), and then added some chicken broth to the sauce before I added the corn starch.  I'm glad I added the mushrooms because they went very well with the dish.  My only complaint is that the chicken was a little dry for my taste.  Next time I will probably brine the chicken before hand.  Other than that, it was absolutely delicious and I will be making it again.

Wayyyyyy too much garlic, even my Ukrainian husband thought it was too much.  I also eliminated the salt, knowing that it probably wouldn't be needed with the proscuitto.  I was also diasppointed in the sauce.  I'm not sure if it was supposed to just be a glaze, but I wanted to use it with the pasta I made to go with the chicken and found it to be unimpressive.  Will add some milk/cream if I ever try this again.

This is the first recipe on this site that we were disappointed with. I followed the recipe exactly although I scaled this back to four servings. We like garlic, but this was waaaay too garlicky for us. There was also way too much sage. I had not used proscuitto before and I lightly salted in the two places in the recipe. It was way to salty. If I were to make this again, I would cut back on the garlic, sage, salt and Prosciutto. At the cost of the prosciutto over a dollar an ounce, it is unlikely I would do this again. Wife said to go back to the chicken cordon bleu with the ham, cheese and seasoning. Sorry.

Of course, I tweaked it a bit by adding provolone cheese and topped with some sauteed baby portabella mushrooms. Very good dish but a little winey tasting. Husband liked the wine taste says it was a refreshing change. I would agree.

This was a nice dish, but nothing fantastic.  I scaled the recipe to two servings and changed a few things.  I reduced the amount of garlic used (used two cloves for two chicken breasts) and instead of using prosciutto (I didn't have any), I used regular ham (very thinly sliced).  Lastly, I also didn't have any fresh sage, so I used dried (which also added a nice flavour).  The appearance of the chicken was beautiful (worthy of guests), but the flavour was nothing special.

This was not as good as I thought... Kinda bland.. If I'm going to stuff a chicken breast like this, I'd rather just throw in some cheese, bread it, bake it, and call it chicken cordon blue instead.. :) Overall, it's a classy meal with delicate flavors, but I won't be making it again.

My family and I truly enjoyed this recipe.  It was a little salty, and took longer to cook than I had anticipated, but we will definitely add this to our "dinner rotation!"  The chicken had a very nice flavor, and my 5 year old even asked for seconds!!

This is fabulous!!! for those that thought this was too salty, you should check your white wine. If you used "cooking wine" from the grocery store, I can see that it would be salty. Cooking wine is ok in very small quantities but it's very salty, so using 1 Cup would definately make this too salty. Try a white wine from the liquor store next time.

This was fantastic!  I was looking for a quick recipe to make with chicken without having to go to the store and I came across this recipe.  Sounded good, but I had to improvise.  Here's what I did:  I pounded chix, sprinkled with ground sage, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Rolled the chix then wrapped with a bacon slice.  Sauted in pan with a little olive oil, then added 1/4 cup white wine with 3/4 cup chix broth and simmered until done.  I added cornstarch mixed with water to thicken into a glaze.  My kids really liked this too! I will definately make this again.

Despite the other reviews I read, I used ham instead of prosciutto (cost and personal taste). We thought it was fabulous. Rather than use water to mix in with the cornstarch, I poured some liquid out of the pan into a small bowl. Added the cornstarch then poured back in. Yum!

This dish is amazing! I added a layer of a smoked Italian cheese in the middle(which I guess makes it not technically Saltimbocca anymore, but great for cheese lovers...). It was DELICIOUS! I also partially covered the pan with a lid for the last 15 minutes and basted it occasionally with white wine and water, and it was very tender when it was done.

This was tasty, though I used too much fresh sage.  Next time I won't put sage inside the chicken roll. I would use 1-1/2 slices of prosciutto next time. I put shredded mozzarella in the roll.  I cooked the chicken in half butter and the remaining olive oil and garlic mixture. Tasty and easy.

We loved this recipe, although I guess I wouldn't be a good cook if I didn't change "SOMETHING". I added half & half to the sauce and I didn't have pruscutto so I used bacon.  The family didn't know the difference.  But we all loved the wine sauce and garlic!!

I made it and then a couple of days later went back to rate it and I couldn't really rememeber what it was - so I suppose there is your answer.  I had to look back at the recipe and then it was like .. "oh ya - now I recall - so for me it was not really memorable but good every day stuff

I'm sorry, I didn't care for this at all. :( The key ingredient in traditional saltimbocca is FRESH sage. When I saw that this dish called for GROUND sage, I should have moved on. I regret that I didn't trust my gut on this one.... My husband makes FANTASTIC saltimbocca. He uses chicken cutlets that are about 1/4 in. thick, seasons them with s&p and tops with fresh sage / prosciutto (he uses toothpicks to hold both in place). He then browns EACH side in a little EVOO and removes the chicken to a (covered) plate while he prepares the sauce. His sauce is pretty much the same as Sue's EXCEPT that he starts with (reduced) chicken stock, adds white wine and deglazes the pan. A swirl of butter pulls it all together. My problem with this recipe is three-fold. First, medium-high heat will burn (yes, BURN!) your garlic! I used jarred minced garlic to brush my chicken with and had to turn the heat down pretty low to keep it from burning. Second, there's no need to cook your chicken for 15-20 minutes, especially thinly pounded breasts that have already been sauteed for 10 minutes (FYI, a thin cutlet will cook thru in UNDER 10 minutes)! And finally, both my hubs and I thought the ground sage was overpowering, not to mention unauthentic. If you must use it, do so sparingly. Pasta and WORSHIP WARRIOR'S Italian peas completed our meal. Maybe this will work for you, but it was a no go for us. Thanks anyways, Sue.

This was delicious and the sauce was amazing!  Dh and my 3yo ate it up.  I used about half of the amt of prosciutto due to cost.  Other than that the recipe as written was perfect

lots of issues with this: the added salt is completely unnecessary.  (also, it seems like a bunch of folks added cheese...if you're going to experiment, do yourself a favor and don't add cheese.  this dish is delicate and elegant, slathering on cheese makes it something you'd get from a take-away pizza place or a diner).  Also, the sauce: much better to simply deglaze the pan with wine, reduce, maybe add a few capers and that's it.  It's just a pan sauce, not gravy - and certainly not meant as a sauce for your pasta side dish.  i suggest you dispense with the cornstarch and go the more authentic route.  Last: 10 minutes of simmering is way too much for chicken scallopine, which is what this uses.  just a few minutes in the skillet will do it (if you leave the chicken flat, instead of rolling it up in the Roman style, it will take about a minute per side).

I rate this 4 because of the directions only.  I think you should bake this in the oven to get the right result.  Aside from that, my family could eat this dish on a regular basis.

This was a tasty way to make chicken flavorful.  Typically when we make a recipe that calls for garlic, we double the amount called for.  We found the garlic to be overpowering, even without doubling it.  We will make this one again but will cut down on the amount of garlic and prosciutto.

Really good and easy to do. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and was light with the salt. My husband defrosted chicken thighs instead of breasts and that turned out to be a happy accident. Not only did the dish have a heartier feel, but the thighs also made it easier to roll up the prosciutto. Glad to know it's versatile!

This recipe was great. I prepared the rolls ahead of time and it was a snap to cook once our guests arrived. I used fresh sage because I had it on hand.  Be careful not to add too much salt when seasoning

This recipe was simply delectable! It was very easy to make; the only difference I made in the recipe was that I put the prosciutto on top of the chicken in the same step as adding the wine.

Adore this recipe. I made a few adjustments (mom can't have alcohol) and used a cup of water instead. The chicken still came out tender and full of flavor. I will be making this again and again.
