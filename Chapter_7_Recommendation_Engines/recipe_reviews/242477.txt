Delicious! This recipe has inspired me to use acorn squash in other recipes! I didn't know how much our family loved acorn squash until this recipe! The flavors here were great. We picked up the fennel from our neighbors farm, so it was super fresh and it pared perfectly with the fennel. To me this seems like an unlikely combination, but it worked! Thank you for a great recipe and thank you Uncle Ben's for making a great rice blend. I can't say enough about the flavor combination here!

We really liked this. The sweetness of the squash and the nuttiness of the balsamic vinegar were great together. I think next time I'll add some slivered almonds to it, I bet they'd be good too.

I recommend you remove the skin and cut squash into slices no larger than 1/2 inch thick. Cutting everything smaller, using more liquid and covering with foil may help. I don't use the fennel because I don't like it.

Great dish!  I cut the vegetables up to smaller sizes before I cooked them allowing more surface area to be coated, and better bite size to eat. I also added chopped up cooked chicken to make a main dish casserole. It was very good. Will make it again with left over Thanksgiving turkey.

Great easy recipe! I cut my vegetables once they were cooked and added some extra balsamic at the end. I also added some additional seasoning. This is a very good side dish. If you like fennel, you should definitely try this. It's a good way to try something new.
