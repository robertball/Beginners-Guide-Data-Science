Absolutely excellent - made this last week, and had some leftovers, so kept them in the freezer, and they went perfectly with the 'award winning chili' tonight!

I made a few changes.  Double the frozen strawberries and leave out the ice.  Very refreshing, and since it is made out of frozen fruit (mostly) it must be good for you, right?

This was our first time trying a strawberry margarita. We love the original lime ones that we've tried from this site, but we didn't like these. They tasted a little too watery/icy with not enough flavor. It was so thick it didn't pour well into the glasses and was very difficult to drink even with a wide straw. I wasn't crazy about all the little seeds from the strawberries in it either. Disappointing.

I love "real" margaritas - just triple sec/lime/tequila. I made this drink for valentines day for my girl and she could not drink it. Its *VERY* strong, just like a real margarita (which I love) but.. its not for the casual drinker. Theres no strawberry essence or flavor... just red color.

We first made these margaritas for our 4th of July cookout last year. This is the first thing that EVERYONE requested for this year's cookout. They are so fresh teasting and are the best strawberry margaritas I have every had. Be careful though; they go down sooo easy and before you know it, you're feeling extremelygood!!!! You really don't need 6 cups of ice, but I wouldn't change anything else!

Very good.  The limeade concentrate makes a nice contrast.  Much better than my old tequila and strawberry mix version.  I used fresh strawberries - YUM!

This recipe was the best I could find on short notice, and I had limeade to use up - but it's way too sweet. Next time I'll experiment with fresh lime juice and sugar or simple syrup.

These were so bomb! I was so proud that they came out so delicious on the first try.  All I had to do additional was add some sugar because the only frozen strawberries I could find was  “no sugar added”.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe! Now I will play with different flavors.

This recipe is a great start but I  made it better. I only use 3 cups of ice, I added 8 ounces at tequila and I added pineapples to the mix. It was great!!!

I made these margaritas last night for Mexican night and wow! Absolutely delicious!  I couldn't find frozen limeade, so I used lemonade instead and added a splash of lime juice.  Sooooo yummy! The second batch I didn't have enough ice, so I added extra strawberries. Worked just as well.  Will make again FOR SURE!!

I made these for a dinner party Friday - they were truly a HIT! I made mostly for the women, but even the men were sneaking a few out! I would definitely recommend!

I made a variation of these last night using the whole 6 oz. can of frozen limeade and also adding 2 oz. of margarita mix.  Very tasty!
