Hi all.  Due to the reviews stating this is bland, I have experimented a bit and came up with a new way to cook the chicken.  Hope you like it!  I put some butter in the pan for frying and added the garlic, which I cooked for a few minutes before adding the chicken.  I spiced up the chicken with light creole seasoning, garlic powder, black peppere, just a dash of cayenne, and parsley.  I have also added a bit of butter and garlic into the broth to add some additional flavor there as well.  Hope everyone enjoys!!

Quick and easy, but was pretty bland.  I added some more spices and fresh herbs to enhance the flavor.

The recipe as is would be bland.  It is easy, quick, and healthy - that is why I gave it three stars.  If you adjust it be adding some spices and herbs, it is pretty good, better than three stars.  I added basil, oregano, additional garlic, minced onion, black pepper.

Didn't make it to spec, used wheat thin spaghetti and a little more of each ingredient -- what we had in stock ;) 

This is a good and fast recipe.  We all liked it and will probably make it again, definitely for the ease of preparation factor.

Unfortunately it was a bit short on flavor, so next we'll definately have to experiment with seasonings.

I was looking for LOW FAT, and thought this fit the bill!  Easy, quick, and I added a garlic black pepper plus some fresh basil!  I also just used canned Chicken Stock instead of the boullion.

This is delicious, with some help.  I used fire roasted tomatoes, and a tablespoon less oil.  It also helps to add more garlic, to taste of course. And next time I'll try 1 cup of water with 2 cubes. There was too much liquid for me.

Let's just put it this way, we ended up ordering pizza.  I am a new cook but I even added spices and onions and my family thought was still so bland that even the 9 month old would not eat it.  I liked how easy it was and am looking for recipes like this but recipes that actually taste good.

This a good starter recipe. For convenience sake, I used pre-cooked, Oscar Mayar Deli cut chicken, halved grape tomatoes, added a dash of red pepper flakes and oregano, and reduced it to one serving.

Reminded me of packaged ramen noodles, but with less flavor. I added garlic, basil, and some pepper and it was so-so after trying to salvage it. Not a keeper.

My husband really liked this, I did use only 1 cup of water for the bouillon.  I also added a sprinkling of thyme, and oregano and quite a bit of salt and pepper.  I will make it again, my husband requested adding red peppers next time so we will try that.

Waste of a meal. As is it lacks total flavor.  But even after trying to salvage the meal with some herbs and spices, it still came out lousy.  The broth makes it way too soupy and it just tasted like eating some pan-chicken on noodles with a lot of watery broth.  Definitely *not* a keeper.

Fair- needed more seasoning and flavor, a bit bland.

I made several changes.  I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and chicken seasoning. Then sautéed in garlic  onion green pepper and canola oil. Drained. Sautéed the chicken in stewed tomatoes with onions celery and green peepers added tomato paste Italian.

 Saved the seasons from the pan.  I use the dripping for the pasta water.  I used regular spegetti noodles. Boiled and added  the dripping to pot water with Italian  seasoning spegetti.

Served spoon chicken and sauce over noodles.
