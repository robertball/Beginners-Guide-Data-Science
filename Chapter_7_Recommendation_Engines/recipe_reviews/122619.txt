This was a GREAT recipe and before I made it I did comparing to the other Apple Bavarian Torte (70 reviews) on this site. The main difference is the amount of "cheesecake like" center. THis recipe uses double the other, which makes it more like a cheesecake w/ apple pie filling on top than a bavarian torte (equal amounts of apple/filling).  Next time I make this, a few changes: (1) make only 3/4 of this filling recipe (2) increase apples by 1 cup (3) add scant dash of fresh nutmeg to cheesecake batter (4) cook til center doesn't jiggle.

Of note: I precooked the apples. Since I used granny smith (which I suggest, do not use red apples or red pie apples like McIntosh), they will take longer to get tender. I sliced 'em up thin and nuked them for 3 minutes in a covered glass dish. I drained them, then tossed in the cinnamon/sugar (to which I added 1 TB of flour b/c of apple moisture). Next time, I may add more flour. The apples weep considerably.

As far as telling when it's done...I cooked mine for 70 minutes and it still jiggled in the middle slightly, which is how you should cook cheesecakes.  I may cook it next time til there is no real jiggle, especially if I want to serve it within 2 hrs of cooling. the center was still mush. However, upon refrigeration the center was perfect.

Lastly: this is usually served warmed or room temp.  So if you refrigerate it b/c you baked ahead, then just let it sit out for a while on the counter or toss in a warm oven to heat up the apples.

I'm a professional chef and this is one of my favorite Fall desserts. Everyone I have served it to also adores it. It's creamy yet not too sweet. The crust is buttery and crisp. Yum!

There are few foods I enjoy more than cheesecake... this one might become one of those things. I make this all the time because it's so easy and everyone loves it! Try using granny smith apples... the more sour, the better.

Wow, awesome recipe! the crust was delicious. Really can't go wrong with this recipe. Used honey crisp apples, and it was super sweet and delicious. Texture was perfect, and lasted for several days in the fridge.

Absolutely amazing! I made it for a pot luck and it was gone before any other dishes. Next time I plan on putting parchment paper in the bottom. Mine stuff a little and the crust was the best part!

This torte was delicious!  Perfect for fall because of the apples, but would also work as a refreshingly cool summer dessert.  Mine did take a very long time to set (I took it out of the oven at 90 minutes because apples began to burn)but that may be because I used reduced-fat cream cheese, which is what I had on hand.  However, the end result was beautiful and tasty and received rave reviews!

This was excellent! I made it the first time according to the recipe...and the second time it was even better when I added 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/2 t almond extract to the crust....and also 1/2 t almond extract to the cream cheese mixture! SOOOO good!

We thought this was pretty good.  The only criticism is that the crust is too thick for a 9" pan.  Next time, I will cut the crust in half and bake it that way.

It's a nice recipe, and not too sweet with the full amount of sugar.  The presentation was pretty.  If I were to make it again, I'd thinly slice or chop most of the apple, mix that into the cheese mixture, reserve enough thin apple slices to make an attractive pattern on top, and dot it with butter.  My 10" springform pan baked in about 1 hour.

A beautiful dessert...far prettier than my photo shows.  I used 3 large Granny Smith apples which yielded about 5 cups of thinly sliced apples.  In the filling, I used 1 cup of the apples which I had cut further into thirds, sprinkled lightly with cinnamon and two shakes of nutmeg before stirring into the cream cheese.  The remaining 4 cups of apples were used for the topping with slightly more sugar and cinnamon to compensate for the extra apples.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and microwaved the apples a little before placing them on top.  There was about 1/3 cup of cinnamon/sugar/apple juice left in the bowl, so I added a little cornstarch and just poured it over the top of the apples.  I was wondering if I would get a soggy torte, but the crust stayed crisp.  I used a 10 inch tart pan and lined the bottom with parchment paper.  This torte would be perfect for a special occasion as it can be made ahead and would travel well too.

This recipe was great! Just what I was looking for. Everyone who tried it, absolutely loved it. I made two but on had One spring-form pan, so i used a regular pie plate for the 2nd torte. I have to say the one in the Regular pie plate was better. The crust was softer. So depending on if you want a soft crust, i would suggest using a pie plate, if you want a harder crust, use the springform pan. Happy Baking!

I just baked this and man it is nice. It looks like I paid $20 for it at a bakery. I used an 11" tart pan because that's what I have, and I have to say, this worked out great. Baked for the recipe's minimum recommended time and it set just fine, isn't runny or anything. The crust was so easy to make, I just stirred it up with my hand. For a beautiful presentation it is so worth the effort to arrange the apple slices neatly "It's not a work of art it's food," no it's a work of art.

This recipe is wonderful, however my husband & I are diabetic so I revised it to reduce the fat & carbs and it was every bit as good. Replaced butter with part almond butter, replaced sugar with Spenda, and replaced 1 cup of the flowur with almond flowur

this was fantastic.  We had my sister over for dinner and between all of us, we devoured it.  We all liked it much better room temp, or slightly warm than cold from the fridge. When it was warm, all the flavors blended together beautifully.  When it was cold, it just tasted like apple cheesecake. Still good, but not as good as warm!

This was good, but the proportions were all wrong. I would make it again but with half the crust and twice the filling. The overabundance of crust just made the whole thing feel dry. I can't wait to try it again though & figure out how to make it work:).

wow what an exceptional cheesecake. I followed the recipe without adding anything to it & it turned out beautifully every time I made it. I sliced the apples, tossed them in sugar & cinnamom then arranged them on top in a circular form. Let the torte cool overnight before tasting otherwise it will taste a bit eggy. People rave about this dessert everytime I make it. Thanks for posting

I give it 4 stars because maybe I botched it a bit by baking it in a bigger pan. It was very thin and sticky. Next time I'll try a smaller container.

I wonder if I made a mistake. It just wasn't the fantastic torte I thought it would be. First of all, the crust was far too thick and buttery. It was a little soggy before it was refrigerated and rock hard after being refrigerated. I took other readers advice and halfed the cream cheese filling. I wish that I hadn't, as it was too dry around the edges. I hope to find a better recipe for this torte. It sounds like a fantastic dessert.

This recipe was not as good as I hoped.  I did follow the recipe exactly except I precooked the apples in the microwave for about 3 minutes like other reviewers suggested and they turned out great.  The filling, however, was the problem for me.  It probably should only have one egg or one egg plus an egg white.  The filling had a very eggy taste that was not appealing for me.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again because of that.  If you do make this recipe consider cutting down the egg or substituting it altogether.  The dessert was beautiful, though, so I had high hopes for the flavor.  Texture was good, just way too eggy as written.

I followed the recipe exactly as is.  All I changed was using a torte pan instead of springform pan.  My company gobbled it up so much that I had to make it again for Mother's Day 5 days later, it was so heavily requested!  To impress your guests, this is a winner taste and presentation!  It is really not very difficult to make at all and the result is stunning!

Everyone always loves this recipe when I make it.  I usually cook the apples with the sugar a bit to release some juices.  Then I place the apples on top of the cheese filling and bake.  I also add slivered almonds the last 20 minutes of baking.  Everyone will think you bought it at a bakery!  Bake this Torte!  :)

I've made this three times now and it's always been well-received. It's easy to make, looks great and my friends who don't like desserts have said that this is the one exception. Great recipe!!!

Looked fantastic and tasted good--would try to spice it up a little if I make it again--the cream cheese tends to overpower the apple/cinnamon.  Enjoyed making this recipe!

This was rich and filling. I had it in Puerto Rico and KNEW I needed the recipe! It is also easy! I am a kid and I was able to make this as a surprise for my family! We had enough to last two nights! I just added 1/4 cup more of sugar to the recipe's filling and used 4 cups of apples instead.

So fresh!  I took it to the coworkers and it was gone in 5 min!  I make it the night before baking it on top of a pan to catch any leaks, then let it sit in the oven overnight as the oven cool, then popped it in the fridge for a couple of hours.  It cuts better after being chilled.

I have made this countless times when apples come into season and LOVE the dessert as is! I do however love to make a crumble to go on the top 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. quick oats, 1.2 c. flour (can be equal parts for any size batch really, I use it on pie too) and then look up the Rum Sauce on this web site..TO DIE FOR when you throw it all together!  Tip: remove the sides of the spring form pan asap or else the sugar in the apples makes a cement that is near impossible to get off. SO YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe has been a favorite of mine for YEARS!  I have another version that calls for 4 cups of sliced apples, which is significantly less than what's listed here.  I've never had trouble with the apples not being soft and perfectly cooked.  I also push the crust up the sides a bit, and put a cookie sheet underneath the springform, because it tends to leak a bit.  SUPER delicious!!

I made it for a family dinner, and they loved it so much, the other women all photocopied the recipe! :) It was very easy to make. Using an apple slicer/peeler/corer makes the slices come out perfectly! VERY yummy.

Mmmm great! I love apples and cheesecakes, so its a great combination! However the crust was a little raw, the reason might be that I used spread instead of butter. Will make this again and again... Thanks

The crust was way too thick and contained too much butter!  It was very hard to cut without marring the bottom of my pan.  The cream cheese tasted like cream cheese - it needs something extra.  This was disappointing.  I ended up throwing  1/2 of it away because my husband didn't want to eat more than 2 helpings.  Sorry.

Hi There,    Thanks for this recipe. It was nice to be able to use the apples from the tree in our yard. The kids loved that aspect. A few changes: When sugar was called for I used half of what is in the recipe. I only had one package of creamed cheese but I did have a package of if (I think it's called) Neufamulch cheese. Well, anyway it has the same texture as creamed cheese and the torte had a little Italian flair to it. Next time I will use this cheese as well. I reserved a handful of perfect looking slices to make a swirl pattern on the top and the rest I roughly chopped up and pressed into the filling. My husband loved the idea of using a spring form pan; neat slices!!    This one is a keeper!!!

I made this recipe as directed (but with a little more apple) and it was good.  We ate it with carmel topping and it enhanced the flavors.  Next time though I am changing the bottom crust to a graham cracker crust and adding a dash of nutmeg or cinnamon to the filling.

This recipe turned out wonderful. I am on a low glycemic diet so did make some changes. I used whole wheat flour, splenda instead of sugar and low fat cream cheese. I agree with others that it does take a very long time to cook.Either way it is a hit and will be served for Easter.

I didn't change a thing with this recipe and it turned out amazing!  My only comment is on the cook time.  My torte took forever to cook through and feel set.  I kept checking until it felt set and it wasn't dry at all.

Great recipe! I like to add a little lemon juice to the filling as well as an extra dash or two of nutmeg and allspice to the apple topping. In addition (and as I think other reviewers may have already commented on) the torte seems to seep a lot during baking, so I find that I have to place aluminum foil underneath the pan. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I have made this dessert many times and it is awesome.  You won't be disappointed.  I do make it a day ahead so the crust is not hard and the taste even better.  It does require a little more cooking time than suggested so the center is cooked. I have also served it with a rum or vanilla sauce and then added fresh raspberries to the plate to make it a really gourmet presentation.

One of the best fall desserts ever!  Family ate it up in 2 1/2 days!!  Only difference was adding 1/2 tsp almond extract to the filling as recommended by another reviewer.  I used a small hand-crank mandolin to slice (3) large cored and peeled apples - super easy and the thin slices baked up perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing!

love this!
I cut down the amount of apples to make it a single layer and i find this is a great amount. i also add a layer of jam/raspberry is good choice after the cheese layer! just adds a little extra i think. Great recipe Thanks!!

My family thought it was great, I served it with vanilla bean ice cream. I used apple pie spice instead of just plain cinnamon.  My crust seemed to get stuck to the bottom of the pan, a little dissapointing since there is so much butter in it.   A comment from my family was to add a drizzle of caramel to the top.  I will definately try this one again.

I made this for a church dinner and everyone just raved and wanted the recipe. Excellent for an autumn meal.

I made this last night and it came out really good. I think using the name Bavarian misleads people into thinking that some sort of bavarian cream is going to be involved. But the crust was nice and crunchy and buttery...almost like a shortbread or sugar cookie. The filling was nice and cheesecake like and the apples came out very well on the top. I made a caramel sauce and poured it all over the top of each slice. very very good with the caramel!

This was a good recipe, however there was way too much crust.  I would cut the amount in half b/c there was almost as much crust as there was filling.

Well to tell the truth we made a mistake and added 2xs the butter to this recipe. The results were Fantastic, but messy while cooking. The Tasters loved it! This is the perfect combo between a pie and a cheesecake style dish.

Absolutely wonderful!  Creamy, with a buttery, crumbly crust.  The apples I used were a few weeks old, and it was still great; I can only imagine how it would taste with apples fresh from the orchard!

Absolutely delicious.  I served it warm with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and my dinner guest almost licked their plates.

Wonderful! The apples on top mean I didn't have to worry about the cheesecake cracking as with other recipes. Baked it about 20 minutes longer than recipe said. Ate it 2 hours after cooling, and out of the fridge the next day. Both were good, but especially on day 1. Enjoy!

I used whole wheat flour. The crust was a little tough, but still good. My kids loved it.

This was beautiful to look at but I wasn not overall impressed with the taste.  It was not very sweet and the cream cheese layer seperated from the apples making it difficult to serve.  The crust once chilled stuck to the bottom of my pan and was not very good at all.

What a treat this recipe was! I had apples, eggs and cream cheese I needed to use up and this was a delicious way to do it (and easy, too!)
