The flavor of potatoes in Mexican food is actually not as unusual as it sounds. Some traditional Mexican foods have potatoes in the ingredients...just usually not mashed with milk. I recommend microwaving them whole and then cubing them & sauteing with the other ingredients. (skipping the milk of course) This provides a little more texture to the enchiladas. The only other thing I added was a few roasted, chopped green chiles that I had leftover from another recipe. These enchiladas would be great for vegetarians, but my husband (the avid meat eater) liked them too!

My family & I enjoyed this recipe but like other reviewers, I tinkered with it to make it more appealing to my family. 
#1 Please don't mash the potatoes, cubed potatoes make a better consistency. 
#2 Use the sharpest cheese you can find and 
#4 Saute onions instead of adding them raw. I think it improves the flavor & you won't have crunchy onions in the mixture.
 We prefer flour tortillas vs. corn so I changed that as well. This recipe is a solid foundation with room to improvise, there are many things a cook can add to change the character of this recipe to suit their family's tastes. Thank you, LauraKE for sharing and the other folks for their suggestions!

These were really good.  I made a few changes to the recipe - I smashed half of the can of pinto beans.  I used only grated cheese - a Mexican blend.  I did not use taco seasoning because I find it too salty - instead I threw in 2 teaspoons each of cumin and chili powder.  I added a clove of garlic - diced.  I used green enchilada sauce which was the absolute perfect topping. And I used fresh salsa that I had just made myself.

This dish is really good. I did not mash the potatoes but used "Simply Potatoes" diced potatoes with onion. You can find them by the eggs in a dark green pack. I followed the cooking directions on the pack but after cooking for the 12 to 15 min. they said to I felt they were still to hard so I then turned them down, added a little water, kept covered and cooked another 10-15 min. Perfect.  When they were done I didn't mash them but kind of broke them up a little and kept going. Texture was perfect. Don't know if I would care for the potatoes being "mashed potatoes". I didn't use the salsa and used a 19 oz. can of enchilada sauce. I think it would have been to dry if I had used less. It turned out great and neither me or my husband missed the fact that there was no meat in them and believe me my husband would have let me know if he had. Will make again.

I made these last night and really liked them.  I used mashed potatos, mixed in a can of refried beans and a small can of green chilies. Using a spatula I spread the mixture on flour tortillas and then added cheese before rolling up and topping with a 10oz can of enchilada sauce.

I found it's better if you use 2 cans of enchilada sauce. Otherwise very tasty!

This one was really a winner with myself and my husband. It has a nice presentation. I did not mash the potatos with a mixer. I just mixed in the beans, onions, and mix into the cooked cubed potatos with the olive oil and milk. It turned out really well and made preparation a little easier. I also skipped the salsa. I thought the enchilada sauce was sufficient. We dolloped sour cream on top. Will definitely make this one again. Excellent meatless meal.

These enchiladas were just good, not terrific.  They came out a bit dry.  Also, next time I will sautee the onions ahead of time to bring out the flavor more and reduce the crunchiness.  This recipe is a wonderful base--I am going to try adding a stronger cheese, adding green chiles or using black beans instead of pintos.  Lots of ways to experiment with this basic recipe.

These are so good!  I used black beans since I didn't have pinto but that is the only thing I changed.  I also used the 10 minute Enchilada Sauce on this website and it was perfect!

Slightly tweeked the recipe by using both black and pinto beans, also added a bit of cilantro to the potatoes. All in all the best non meat enchiladas I've ever made.

These looked and sounded really good but I didn't care for them. I really like trying different enchilada recipes but I just didn't care for the texture of the mashed potatoes in this casserole. Too mushy for me. I think I would prefer the potatoes diced after being cooked instead of mashed. I actually felt like I wasted some homemade ingredients (enchilada sauce and salsa). Sorry for the poor review but I am glad other people enjoyed these.

This was good, but I followed the suggestions given by other reviewers, so I don't know about the original recipe. I fried my tortillas while my potatoes were boiling, and sauteed the onion in the leftover oil. I added the olive oil and milk to the potatoes and mashed them up a little bit, but left in large potato chunks. I also used chili-and-lime refried beans, and added jalepenos. I used only one can of sauce and had no problem with moisture. I also added much more cheese to the top than the recipe calls for. I thought these were delicious and very filling--I didn't need to serve any side dishes except chips and salsa. I have a TON of leftovers, including a lot of leftover filling that will have to be used for burritos or something.

I had to give this a four, because we took everyone's advice and did NOT go with mashed potatoes. Instead I roasted the potatoes in a little oil and half the taco seasoning, at 450, for 1/2 hour. Mixed other half of seasoning with beans. I also skipped the onions and sprinkled with scallions, afterward, just cuz that's what we had. Served with sour cream. Substituted all cheddar with feta on top, again cuz that's what we had. That worked fine. And I would definitely like this served with shredded lettuce.

i make this all the time. we loveeeeee it.  its on our monthly meal list.  i actually prefer the mashed potatoes over cubed. unlike most of the reviewers.  &  i came across these habanero flour tortillas at trader joes that are really good with this recipes.  We love black olives so we toss some on at the end when you put the rest of the shredded cheese on, its really good like that.

We love these.  The only thing we do different is we lightly sautée the onions before adding to the burrito mix because they are too raw for us otherwise.

This was very good!  I sauteed the onion and a little green pepper before adding it to the potato mixture.  We had some left over and used it for a quesadilla the next day and it was good there too.

Loved this but I changed in just a bit. I added hamburger, corn and doubled the amount of enchilada sauce. I also eliminated the salsa. My hubby and daughter LOVED it and so did I. Yummy.l

I made this recipe because I had a left over baked potato, so count me in as another reviewer who didn't use mashed potatoes. I sauted half a large onion in canola oil, added the cubed potato, sprinkled with taco seasoning and then added the almost fully drained can of pinto beans. Used an 8oz bag of shredded Mexican cheese and most of a 19oz can of enchilada sauce. This made 15 enchiladas.

A very tasty recipe, though I agree with other reviewers that the recipe as written comes out too dry.  Twice as much sauce wouldn't be too much.  I used "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" from this site. Tasty! Liked this as a hearty main dish without meat.  Hard to please my husband with any meatless main dish, but he enjoyed this one.

I followed other cook's suggestions and didn't mash the potatoes, used black beans instead of pinto, green chilies instead of the salsa and sauteed the onions. They turned out well and I will make them again. I might add a can of corn next time for color and sweetness.

These were great! They have some substance to them even though there isn't any meat in them and really fill you up.  I needed to add extra enchilada sauce to make sure that they were covered completely (I was worried they would dry out).  Definitely a keeper.

Yummy.  I use small flour tortillas and skip the frying in oil.  My vegetarian daughters often request this and it is great the next day for lunch.

This is one of our new favorites!  Like other reviewers, I left out the milk and oil and didn't mash the potatoes.  I slightly mashed some of the beans.  Also, I used Bush's chili beans and didn't drain them. I left the cheese out of the inside and just sprinkled on top before baking.  This was fabulous!

Looked really great but they were not exceptionally great or a big hit. Made as stated in the recipe and would have probably done better to follow some of the other reviewers suggestions.

I will add this to my other potato enchilada recipie.  I actually cook the potatos, let them cool, then shred them in my cuisinart.  You get much better texture than mashed. Would suggest folks do that.

This was quite tasty, all 3 adults in our family liked it.  A good way to use up mashed potatoes too!  I didn't have any pinto beans so I substituted a can of refried beans - came out very good.

This is easy & wonderful. I love the mashed potato enchiladas I get at a local restaurant so this recipe was what I was looking for. Try adding in some frozen corn or a can of mexicorn or a small can of diced green chiles. I love that you can play with this to your taste. I used a 14 oz can of enchilada sauce and think the increased sauce is best because the yummy sauce is what makes it enchiladas. I also sauted the onions like other reviewers and it worked great. Not sure how it would have tasted with the raw onions. Saved to my recipe box and I'll make it often. Thanks LauraKKH!!

This was a fantastic recipe. I did a few adaptations.  In the skillet, I used a can of refried beans, threw in a couple tablespoons of diced jalapenos and diced garlic cloves, and used a combination of diced, cooked potatoes and sweet potatoes.  I just added the diced potatoes to the beans mixture, rather than mashing them first.  I also added a cup of leftover shredded chicken.  I had Muenster cheese on hand, which I used rather than the Jack.  This recipe is easy to adapt to whatever you may have on hand.  Very good.

These were very good, but a little on the dry side.  I will most likely try this again and hope I get them a little less dry.

My husband and kids loved it. I ran out of the potato mixture so I will probably use 3 potatoes next time. Very easy to prepare.

Good flavor, interesting mix of spicy and mild. I took another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the cubes potatoes rather than mashing them. My only complaint was that they came out rather dry this way. Will tinker with the recipe a little more if I make it again.
