Well I'm happy I kept looking through the pages for a recipe and found this one at the very end. This was great! I'm a low carber so this was a really tasty, non bland recipe my whole family enjoyed. I marinated my chicken overnite and the meat really soaked up the juices. That is what I love about chicken thighs. I also added a little bit of Splenda because I like my asian dishes a bit on the sweeter side. The vinegar balanced out the sweetness really well. This goes really well with roasted eggplant. Thanks for the recipe!

It’s just a tasty, tender way to make chicken. Being fast and easy is nice too. A friend made her Filipino uncle’s recipe for me once and it was great. I got some skinless, boneless thighs on sale and decided to give it a try. Surprisingly Allrecipes doesn’t have many Chicken Adobo recipes. Thanks Pam this one is simple and to the point. My friend also mentioned the vinegar and soy sauce base. She used bone-in thighs. Thighs are supposed to be the traditional chicken part for this dish because of the way the dark meat absorbs the marinade flavor better. It’s not too salty or vinegary or spicy or garlicky. The sauce is more like dark gravy. I used a dark soy sauce (from an ethnic grocery) and made mine with Balsamic vinegar. (I was out of apple cider vinegar.) I marinated my thighs for several hours. I also sautéed about 2 tsp. of minced garlic in the olive oil and didn’t remove it from the pan. I added cornstarch to thicken for a more gravy-like sauce. My friend’s sauce had been thicker too. Serve extra sauce over white rice. I'm not a dark meat fan but I'll make this again. Hubby also gobbled it up and he’s very critical of chicken made any way other than fried.

Wow.  I was not expecting for this recipe to taste this darn good.  A recipe box keeper for sure.

This is a seriously flavorful chicken dish.  I used boneless thighs (I only had about a lb so there was lots of sauce) and marinated them for about four hours in the fridge.  I pressed two cloves of garlic into the hot oil and when it started to get golden I put my chicken on top of the garlic.  I found that the recipe's cooking time was pretty accurate though I kept my flame a bit higher than medium to get the pieces to brown. I also found that the two minutes extra cooking at the end did help thicken the sauce, so I didn't need to add any thickener as a reviewer below mentioned. I used a fat-skimmer cup to pour the sauce (minus fat) over the plattered chicken and it was beautiful, dark and glossy.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks. (oh, I also used regular soy, not low sodium - it was delicious!)

This was a very easy, quick recipe. I used boneless thighs and only marinated as long as it took me to prepare the oil/garlic and to start my rice. The marinade smelled strongly of the apple cider vinegar, and I was afraid that the chicken might be too vinegary, but once the chicken was cooked, it tasted great. And the sauce was superb with white rice. My whole family loved it, even the 14 month old! I will definitely make this recipe again, but will leave the chicken in the marinade longer.

Outstanding! My 9 y/o asks for this often! I use low sodium soy sauce and add about 1/8 c. more but other than that it's great!
