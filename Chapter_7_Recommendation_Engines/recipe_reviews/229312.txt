I made this recipe for family brunch on Thanksgiving morning.  I assembled everything the night before so all I had to do was take the dish from refrigerator to oven the morning of-- a great time saver.  Everyone loved it, even my niece who is not a fan of eggs, had 2 helpings.  The only note I would make is I think the amounts of mustard powder & butter are transposed.  I used 2 tsp of mustard powder (Not 2 TBL ) & 2 TBL of butter (not 2 tsp). I also cut the milk to 2 1/2 cups.  Will definitely make this again.  Probably at Christmas.

Tasty strata. I found for me there was not nearly enough egg. I used 1 1/2 times what recipe called for and I think next time I'll double. I adjusted the seasonings to compensate and used a mixed Mexican cheese and homemade turkey sausage

Very good, I omitted the ham but used more sausage and added fried cherry tomatoes for color. It could also use more liquid.

I made  it for a work breakfast and it turned out well!  I used half sharp cheddar cheese and omitted the ham, I think it would have been meat overload to have both sausage & ham in it.  I added 3-4 eggs just because it seemed to need it. I never use white bread for these recipes but instead chose a whole wheat bread with nuts in it...it added a wonderful texture!  One last addition was onions.  I love spinach but omitted it because I was concerned about it being too moist.  I added onions.  Next time, I will add the spinach and compensate with more eggs.  I'll also play around with various cheeses!

I made this exactly by the recipe. Simple and easy, actually fun, to make. I will make this again and tweak it with adding other veggies. It was great as is. Hubby loved it too! Thanks for sharing!

Delish! I used 12 eggs instead of 8. Cut up about 3/4 of a day old baguette. Didn't have spinach. Used frozen precooked sausages, cut up then microwaved (not sure if that was necessary). Cooked one med chopped onion with the mushrooms. Forgot the flour. Also forgot to grease the dish! Remembered it in the morning before baking thank goodness. Greased a second dish and slid everything in from the first. Turned out GREAT!! Fam loved this!!

I only changed one thing. I used bread crumbs. oh and no mushrooms as I'm allergic .  All I have to say is everyone in my house hold loves this dish and we're all a bunch of picky eaters. When my husband sees me making this dish he starts to dance. That in its self says how good this is. Thank you for sharing.

I made this last week as a rehearsal for Christmas morning, unfortunately we thought  it was just ok. We found it to be way too bland for our taste, even though I added extra salt, pepper and some paprika. I won't make this again.

Made this for a club event and everyone loved it!  I would recommend cutting back on the amount of milk used if you prefer more egg vs a custard like texture.

Very good. I used what I had on hand. No sausage. Lots of vegetables. Added chives. Subbed a tablespoon of prepared mustard for dry since I was out.

Very flavorful - much will depend on the seasoning of your sausage.  I used canadian bacon instead of ham and rosemary bread. Otherwise made it as written. As I made it, it was very savory - for our tastes, definitely a late brunch item not early breakfast.

Made this for Christmas Brunch and everyone loved it. Used Italian sausage, Italian bread and had a 16 ounce bag of spinach. Very flavorful. Will definitely make again.

Followed Zoobeedo’s suggestion and reversed the amounts of butter and dry mustard.  Only used sausage, too.  After baking perfectly, and then serving, I put a sauté topping of 4 different colored peppers, one medium onion and a can of Italian chopped tomatoes over the top!!  Delicious

Next time I’ll cut down on the bread a bit, and dice the ham so it’s not so chunky.  This recipe had a great flavor, and it made the house smell fabulous while it was baking!  I’m looking forward to serving it when we have overnight guests :)

My husband gives this his highest rating, 5 stars, restaurant quality! I sautéed fresh spinach with the mushrooms instead of using frozen. I baked low carb garlic cheese muffins (made with almond flour) for the bread and left out the flour and half the milk. Delicious! Worthy of company.

This was really good!  I did use 12 eggs and next time would do more sausage but that is bc I like sausage more than ham. Thank you for a great recipe!

Made individuals in muffin tins to take to early set up for rally. Easy for workers to pick up, in case they didn't get breakfast. Really yummy. Added diced jalapeños. Bacon the only meat. Yummy.

I would love to be able to figure out a way to make it where it is not so high in sodium.

This was a big hit. I was looking for a breakfast recipe I could get ready the night before and only need to bake off. I did half the recipe. I used fresh spinach and thick bacon instead of ham. Flavors were fabulous. I will make this again

Huge hit. As per other's reviews, I added eggs (10 total) and reduced milk to 1.5 cups. I used a loaf of  slightly stale salt-rising bread. Otherwise I made as written. I chilled 2 hours and baked uncovered for 1, and it was perfect. My Easter visitors ate it up. I'd forgotten they were not mushroom fans, but this recipe is so easily adaptable to other veggies.

This was a great recipe to use up all my random leftovers. I had some hot links that I diced up along with kielbasa, instead of sausage. Otherwise I kept the recipe pretty much the same. I may add some garlic and/or onion next time.

I made this with Turkey Breakfast Sausage and whole grain bread to make it a little healthier. I also omitted the ham and spinach. I used what I had on had and added red/orange/yellow bell peppers instead.  I also thought 2 Tbsp of Mustard powder seemed like alot so I only but in about 2 tsp. I didn't have time to let it refrigerate for 2 hours so I let it sit for about a half hour while I was doing some other cooking and it still turned out great!.

This was easy and very very tasty!  My partner rarely gives feedback, he gets seconds and thirds instead.  After I made this he grazed on it ALL DAY.  I made this for Christmas last year and will do it again this year and start a tradition.  YUM!

This was a big hit for our family brunch this weekend! I was not able to let the bread dry out, but it turned out delicious anyway.
