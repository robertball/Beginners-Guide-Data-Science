I copied this recipe exactly, even found the creole seasoning on sale at my local grocers. The flavor was perfect. Of course now it is only my husband and me so this recipe made a ton. I have a very small grill so instead of wrapping each portion in foil, I put it all into a cast iron pan and covered it with foil. It was fantastic!!

Easiest and most delicious recipe!  Added mince garlic to the oil and included half of an lemon.  Lastly we grilled a buttered French loaf to add to the meal. We will make again!

I'd cook the potatoes a bit longer but it's delicious

Substituted for red potatoes    

Excellent recipe!   Will probably add crab next time.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except I used cooked frozen (thawed) shrimp because I'm pregnant and didn't want to risk the possibility of accidentally undercooking the shrimp. I also cooked the potatoes a little longer than 10 min; they came out perfectly. The flavor was outstanding. My husband said it tasted like summertime :) Will absolutely be making this again, for company! A very impressive dish.

Delicious to eat and easy to prepare.  Basically followed the recipe but substituted italian sausage for kielbasa.  Mine came out a bit salty, probably due to my liberal application of creole seasoning.  I recommend 15 min on a grill burning at about 400 - 450 F.  Beyond that shrimp will overcook.
