Fantastic Hot "chocolate" - loved it.  Tastes like real hot cocoa, but it's healthier with carob.  Great for us because chocolate gives us headaches!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!   To save time and to avoid using milk,  I boiled water in the kettle, poured it over the carob powder, added honey, vanilla and 2-3 tablespoons of coconut milk and stirred.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time trying anything Carob. The recipe looked easy enough so I gave it a try. I dumped everything in a sauce pan at the same time and whisked over low flame until hot. 
It's quick, easy and yummy!!

Really nice. If nobody told me I wouldn't know it wasn't made with cocoa.

I have been "dairy free" for about 2 years now.  Recently, I also developed a severe sensitivity to chocolate.  In the last week or so, I have been "jonesing" for a cup of hot cocoa.  I had forgotten about carob as a substitute, so I made this using light organic coconut milk and WOW!  This totally satisfies my cocoa cravings!  I use organic maple sugar to sweeten my drinks.

We strive to eat organically, non-GMO, and sugar-free. (We use honey instead of sugar) We sometimes -if not most of the time:-). As I was reading through the recipe (*after 95% not expecting any results to come up 5% expexting at least something because, after all, this is Allrecipes*), I saw that there was already honey on the list and no sugar in sight! It tastes wonderful with Silk unsweetened original almond milk and is just right when you heat it up in between 4 and medium. Thanks

This was delicious and satisfied my 4 year old chocolate lover.  I used a local raw honey that was very flavorful but I think it will also work with something a little more mild.

This is my daughters favorite holiday treat! She’s actually allergic to chocolate so on the holidays we’ve made this recipe for last couple years and it's been a new tradition so she isn’t missing out on the traditional hot chocolate milk. And we all love it too

I added about another 1/2 tablespoon carob to make it a little richer. I only used 1 teaspoon of honey and it was good. If I was craving something sweet, I might use another teaspoon. I think 3 teaspoon (=1 Tblsp) would be too sweet for me. Also, I tasted it before and after adding vanilla and couldn't really notice that big of a difference. But I also only have imitation vanilla,  the good stuff might make it better. 
The recipe on the back of the tin calls this a carob latte. I think that is a misleading name because that is for coffee and milk. But just calling it hot carob feels not enough for me, because if people were not familiar with carob they would not realise just by name it is a riff off of hot cocoa. Maybe a carob steamer? At the coffee shop a steamer is flavored hot milk, like a latte without the coffee.

This was delicious! I used vanilla unsweetened soy milk and heated the drink in the microwave in my mug. Quick, easy, and soothing!

Great hot cocoa!  I used hazelnut milk which is slightly sweet, cut the honey, and it came out perfect.

I'm a fan of carob, but what a surprise! This was so good, and very easy! Pinning it :) I'm looking forward to sharing this one with friends and family.

I used unsweetened almond milk and eyeballed the honey. With carob's natural sweetness, I'm curious how it'll be with half (even none) of the honey.

I am a hot chocolate fanatic and after trying this recipe I am hooked using carob powder in place of cacao :) Carob adds warm(haha) fullness that leaves your taste buds yearning for another drink :) I would recommend any hot chocolate fan to try this recipe instead!

An awesome substitute for hot chocolate! Very satisfying.
