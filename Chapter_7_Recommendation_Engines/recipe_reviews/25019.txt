These are really good! I think these have the *perfect* amount of chocolate flavor. They are nice and rich with the cream cheese, but not overly sweet. I halved the recipe and still ended up with 24 cookies. 8 minute cooking time with 5 minutes of cooling on the pan was spot on. The dough was really easy to work with and the directions were clear and concise, which I always appreciate. Give these a shot! Thanks :)

These are surprisingly addictive!  I can't stress enough - take these out of the oven at 8-8 1/2 minutes and let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes.  They will not look done when you remove them from the oven, but by the time they cool off on the rack, they'll be perfection!!  Moist and chewy like a gourmet cookie!  Two minor changes I made: 1.)used the Nestle chocolate & peanut butter chip bag (come mixed together).  It was really good without being overly peanut-y. and 2.) I dropped by rounded TABLESPOONS, not teaspoons (would be a ridiculously small cookie if you did that!).   Also, I baked 2 dozen, then formed the rest into balls (about another 2 dozen), froze them on a cookie sheet, then transferred to baggies.  It's been great to pull out a few cookie balls and bake them up fresh!!  (Balls are formed with the same measurement:  rounded tablespoon.)  Also, I agree with another reviewer - flatten them out a bit like you do with a peanut butter cookie dough.

WOW! I was initally a little nervous trying a recipe that didn't have any reviews and only 1 rating, but I am SO GLAD that I did!  These are wonderful.

The thing that sets these cookies apart is the texture.  They are so soft, they literally just melt in your mouth. I've never had a cookie like this before, so it is hard to describe.  The best I can say is just try them!!

I used 1/2 cup splenda instead of the white sugar and 2 large eggs.  I took  them out of the oven right at 8 minutes.  Make sure you use peanut butter chips that are fresh...mine were a bit old and a little stale.  Despite stale chips, the cookies were WONDERFUL!

these were really tasty.  i realized more than halfway thru the recipe that i had no eggs!  so, i grabbed a ripe banana and used that as a binder instead.  wow!  you can taste the banana in the cookie, and my husband said it "would have been Elvis' favorite"!  thanks for the recipe :)

Loved the chewy consistency- a nice substantial cookie. Appreciated the use of only 1/2 c. butter and I substituted low-fat cream cheese. However, these cookies were indiscriminately sweet (overpowered the peanut butter), not really chocolatey.

Very good cookies.  Will try with a little mashed bananas next time. Know that these cookies do not spread so flatten them a bit before baking or you end up with big cookie mounds!

Exceptional!  The cookies are so soft and chewy.  I think that 2 cups of flour would do, as the dough was almost crumbly with 2.5 cups.  Still delicious!

if i could give this 0 stars i would; i am 17 and i love to bake so i tried the cream cheese instead...people in my house were so disappointed you cant even taste the chocolate  only peanut butter..they were flat and crispy; just like paula says butter makes it better and never again will i try a substitution for butter. i think that had ALOT to do with it and the fact that it only says 1/3 cups of cocoa powder sorry ;(

These cookies were a big hit at my house!  I bake cookies all of the time and this is definitely one of the best recipes I have ever made.  Cookies have a chocolaty, warm, chewy center that just melts in your mouth.  To those that said the cream cheese was overpowering, make sure you are only adding 3 ozs.  I did recipe exactly as described but was out of butter so substituted the same amount of crisco and added 3 tsps. of water, omitted applesauce and replaced with water for moistness, cooked for 8.5 minutes and cooled for 5.  Perfect!!!

I did alter the recipe slightly because I did not want to buy a can of applesauce only to use 1 tablespoon.
