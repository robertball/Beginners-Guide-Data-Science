This is a great recipe! I make as is or add milk or juice instead of some of the water. I add dried cherries, or cranberries, pecans. I use brown sugar, white sugar, or maple syrup. I usually add 1 cup of pumpkin puree with pumpkin spices. But however I make it, it is always yummy! If you double it, you reduce the chances of it burning on the sides and you can freeze individual portions in the small 1 cup Ziplock containers. Then microwave frozen for 3 minutes.

For the reviewer wondering...Steel-cut oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into only two or three pieces by steel rather than being rolled. They are golden in color and resemble small rice pieces. Steel-cut oats are also known as coarse-cut oats, pinhead oats, or Irish oats. I usually buy them in bulk at my local farmer's market co-op store. This recipe is delish. I love the addition of the apple and the use of the crock pot. It makes the whole house smell wonderful, and there is very little effort or time required from me. My two year old would eat this for every meal of the day if I gave him the option (which is tempting on some days).

I've made oats in the crock pot for years. Instead of water I use milk or soy milk. The water alone is too bland. This is a great starter and lends itself to additions like adding a  tablespoon of peanut butter or toast some walnuts or almonds and add to the pot and let cook with the oats.  Try maple with the vanilla extract.

Thanks for posting the recipe.

Using steel cut oats (like the recipe calls for) NOT rolled oats is super important in this recipe.  Those who complain about it being complete mush are likely using the quaker oaks, or rolled oats.  Steel cut oats look like tiny pieces of uncooked rice, not the flat round oats.  This is a great recipe for early mornings for the whole family.  Thanks!

I did slight variation of this ... added 4 cups water to my 1 c steel cut oats. 3 TBS of ground flaxseed. 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. 2 chopped organic gala apples. Added raisins after cooking. sprayed the crockpot with pam spray just in case to prevent sticking. after 8 hrs, oatmeal was perfect. we added some sweetener, me: Truvia; hubs: agave nectar. It was so filling and yummy! had leftovers for tomorrow morning's bfast!

A simple solution to it sticking and burning on the sides of the crockpot is to cook it in a water bath in the crock.
Just spray a 1 1/2- 2 qt casserole (whatever you can fit in your crockpot-i've even used a 2 cup Pyrex bowl covered with foil inside a mini crockot).  Put your ingredients inside the casserole ,cover it ,and put inside the crock
  Fill with water about 3/4 of the way up the sides of the casserole and cook on low.
No crockpot cleanup, no burnt oats,  and leftovers just get covered and put in frig.

I get home from work at around 2 in the morning and always check AR for the newest reviews.  I saw this recipe and thought it would be great to wake up at 10:30 and have breakfast made. I had all the ingredients, so I tossed this together in the crockpot.  When I got up, this was cooked perfectly.  It did need some salt; since the recipe didn't call for it, I didn't put any in at the beginning.  My husband added more brown sugar and raisins to his, but I ate mine just the way it came out (except for adding salt).  Very good recipe.  Perfect for work nights.  Thanks, brandysue!

I really did not care for this at all. The only change I made was using about 1/4 cup of raisins instead of a 1/2 cup. I thought 3 1/2 cups of water to 1 cup of oatmeal seemed like a really wrong ratio. I normally cook oatmeal on the stove top in about 5 minutes. The oats have a nice bite to them still. I decided to try this method after seeing many recipes. I thought the oatmeal was mushy and it was surrounded with a thick gummy liquid. I also didn't care for the darker brown color. I am one to normally cut sugar in a recipe, but this one needed at least twice the brown sugar listed to give it some flavor. The crock pot was also a pain to clean. No one would eat it and it ended up getting tossed. It was so thick, brown, and mushy, I didn't know how to salvage it.

This is an easy way to go and customizes easily with what fruits/flavors you like and have on hand. I was surprised to see some of the neg. reviews didn't appear to have actually read the directions. Steel-cut oats are NOT rolled, quick, or instant. They really do take about 3 1/2 to 4 cups of water per cup of oats (and if you cook them on the stovetop, they take about 30 minutes!). I tried this the first time during the day on a weekend so that I could keep an eye on it. Every crock pot is not created equal. I have one crock pot that likes to burn this. I have to use the 'warm' setting or cook a double batch. It freezes fine. Will defrost for me (in MY microwave) on 5 min defrost cycle--no hot/cold spots. (Flattened food thaws more quickly) TY very much BrandySue

Very easy and Very good breakfast! I didn't have raisins so I used dried cranberries, may stick w/them because they were plump and juicy. I did add a touch of sugar when I served it.

How funny!  I found a recipe almost exactly like this last night, and threw it in the crockpot before bed. I'm eating it right now.  The one I used is part apple juice and part water, and no raisins.  Everything else is exactly the same.  Its really good!

Great oats! I modified a bit - used my mini crock pot and an appliance timer to set it for 5 hours on low, programmed to finish when we wake up. I used 2 cups almond milk and 1 cup water, the oats, apples, and raisins. Subbed maple syrup for sugar and cut back on the cinnamon. Yum! My kids absolutely love this oatmeal, and I love that I don't have to think about it in the morning.

I made these to take to work.  Everyone loved them!  I filled my crock pot, turned it on and went to bed.  It was great to wake to a house smelling like apple pie.  These had good flavor.  I'm going to make these again next week for our breakfast at work.  We're thinking we might try them with blueberries or maybe strawberries instead of apple.

I made this yesterday and it was so easy and turned out delicious. It smells like Christmas when you wake up. We enjoyed a 2nd bowl today. Easy to toss left overs in tupperware to freeze, 2-3 minutes to microwave and you can enjoy again. I added some chopped pecans and a little milk to it after I dish it into a bowl just because thats how my husband and I like it. You could easily add or subtract ingrediants to your liking. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This Recipe is just as fabulous as everybody says.  My wife is on a "Girl'cation" and I have the kids for the week.  I put the oats in with the water, added the rest of the ingredients and by morining it was perfect.  The kids liked it so much they want it again tomorrow.  Best part was that the kids bragged about it at the bus stop to all the other kids and their Moms!

So so so GOOD!  I doubled the recipe so I would have some to freeze in individual baggies. What I did different was instead of raisins I used dried cranberries and added a bit of nutmeg and an extra tbs of brown sugar. I tried it on te warm setting and when we got up it was soupy-- but soft-- so I turned it to low for about an hour and it thickened up beautifully. Next time I'll start it earlier on low and when I go to bed turn it to warm. Very good! Smelled like apple pie!!

So easy and versatile!  I prefer mine with some walnuts in it for crunch, have also tried it with dates instead of raisins.  A hearty breakfast that will stick with you for a long time.

I love steel cut oats but don't usually have time in the morning to make a batch.  This was quick and easy to prepare.  I did have to turn my crock pot down to the warm setting for the last couple of hours, but that's the fault of my equipment, not the recipe.  It was delicious!

Super easy, yummy, and good for you! 
I used half water/half milk and cooked this during the day so I could monitor it the first time.  In my crockpot I cooked it on low for 5 hours and then turned it to warm for the next 2 hours to keep it from getting overly mushy.  
There isn't a whole lot of flavor in it but each member of my family doctored their bowl up in a different way using bananas, brown sugar, maple syrup etc... to suit their own tastes.   Made a double batch and froze some in single portions for my husband to take to work in the morning.  I was surprised at how well it reheated!
 Overall a healthy and very easy recipe the whole family enjoyed. My only suggestion....USE A CROCKPOT LINER!  After seeing the shape of my crockpot liner after this recipe, I was reeeealllly happy I used one!

This was very easy to throw together. I followed the recipe exactly cooking for 8 hrs. I did not like the raisins in this. They may have been good if they were added at the end. I was a little concerned at the amount of  cinnamon but surprisingly it was not overpowering. It did come out very thick but I always add a touch of milk to my oatmeal anyways. I did not think it was very sweet so I did add a little sugar to it. Very good overall recipe. I would make this again.

I loved this recipe.  I had dried apple slices so I used those instead and they come out fully hydrated like fresh apples and it was very tasty.  Maybe next time I will only use half of the cinnamon as the cinnamon kind of overpowered the other flavours.  Maybe I will experiment with other spices as well like pumpkin pie spices.  There can be so many excellent variations to this recipe!

I think it would be a little tastier/sweeter if apple juice was used instead of water, but otherwise its good and easy!

I LOVE THIS!!  My husband and I are recent empty nesters and I can make this for Monday morning and eat it for 3-4 days each morning.  It's delicious!  I didn't have cinnamon the first time I made it, I only had pumpkin pie spice and that worked well too.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!!

I think people don't understand that this is a recipe that depends on YOUR crockpot being just like hers.  That is, doesn't overcook or undercook!  And you can ADD more sugar after it's cooked, it's meant for more than one meal or more than one person so microwaving one bowl isn't the same!! I also like butter & a sprinkle of sugar on the top of HOT cereal so to each his or her own, wouldn't you say?  No, I don't put butter on Cheerios but it's like comparing apples to oranges.  The recipe is great as is but go ahead & make changes to suit yourself!!  Don't accuse her of a "faulty" recipe!

Steel cut oats.  I put this together Christmas Eve and cooked overnight for Christmas morning to keep us fed until the mid day brunch.  This was just excellent!!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and would suggest not cooking them but putting them on top.  Also served with coconut, cranberries, brown sugar and milk on top.  Yum, Yum.  Ate the left overs for next couple of days.  Easy to re-heat in microwave.  thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and unfortunately, the slow cooker I used is a manual one, and it didn't switch over to warm. There was some heavy sticking to the bottom of the crock (I wouldn't call it burned). additionally, there was way too much water for my taste (and I used McCann's steel cut oats), and the cinnamon was a little strong. The taste was good, however, once I got past the cinnamon.  So, next time I make it, I'll use 3 cups of water, half the cinnamon, and I'll use my other crock pot, which switches to warm after the cook time has been reached. Thanks for the recipe brandysue, it smelled wonderful this morning!

Made this last night for breakfast today and it's fantastic.  I think anyone who ended up with mush probably didn't use steel cut oats.  Mine cooked about 9 hours and came out great.  I did end up adding quite a bit more sugar, cinnamon and butter as well as some salt. Then I topped it with half-and-half, but that's just personal preference.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Loved waking up to a house that smelled like cinnamon and a healthy breakfast waiting for us.

I make this often for my 4 children. We use Irish oats and I add dried fruit instead of chopped apples, Even trail mix is delicious and it's easy and nutritious!

I made this recipe for hubby who gave it 4 stars. Today is hubby's birthday and this is what he requested for breakfast. So throwing everything together last night made breakfast super easy. This recipe made enough for four bowls so I put the other three away for him to reheat. 

I followed the recipe almost to the letter for the first time. With the exception of- I cut the cinnamon in half because I use 3% oil Korintje cinnamon and it's stronger. So I always use less cinnamon and hubby said cinnamon level was perfect. I used our own frozen apples from the freezer. The other modification was I used 4 oz apple juice, 1 1/2 c milk, and 1 1/2 c water instead of all water. Next time I'm going to cut the amount of liquid by 1/2 cup if I don't thrown in dried fruit. Otherwise hubby says this is a winner and will be his new steel cut oats basic recipe. Thanks so much for an easy, great recipe.

This was great!  I substituted milk, as some others had suggested.  I also added 1/2 c. of dried mixed berries rather than just the raisins.  Yum!!!

I omitted the sugar, raisins and butter.  I increased the apple to 2 medium gala apples and cooked on low overnight.  Luckily I used some non-stick spray, otherwise it would have been awful to get out of the crockpot!  Next time I will cook everything on 'keep warm'.  it was awful trying to scrape everything out while it was hot.  Great for weekday breakfasts--thanks!

this is fabulous! Mine was done after probably 4 hours. Didn't use the butter. Might increase the water a 1/4 cup next time. Loved this. Reheats just fine!

This is a delicious recipe, BUT . . . I don't understand why you would put this in your crockpot for six to eight hours when you can make this exact recipe in your microwave in a few short minutes. I have oatmeal almost every day of the week. I make it using steel cut oats and unsweetened Almond milk and most of the other ingredients mentioned in this recipe. I'm enjoying my breakfast in minutes. So while yes, this is a delicious recipe as written, just know that you can make it quicker and easier in your microwave if you choose. And go ahead and tweak those ingredients to suit your own taste. Don't like raisins? Try dried cranberries, apricots or even blueberries. Or leave the fruit out all together. Just go with what you enjoy.

This is a good "starter" recipe, but after making it once, I changed a few things...I wouldn't add the fruit until its done cooking because the starches make the oatmeal a think , sticky mess, I also didnt add any sugar.  I only added the oats, water, 1tbs vanilla, and 1tbs cinnamon.  I set out all of the other toppings like an "oatmeal bar" that way ppl can dress their bowl any way they'd like! I also cooked it on the "warm" setting for 8 hours, making sure to spray the crockpot with Pam....

I don't like making breakfast and this was so nice to wake up to!  I cut down the amount of cinnamon to about a teaspoon or so (i just eyeballed it) and I omitted the raisins and added walnuts.  My crockpot is a no bells and whistles thing, so I cooked it on warm for about 8 hour!s.  It needed a little more sugar, but that can always be added later.  I prefer oatmeal to be mushy, so this was perfect for me. This receipe's a keeper

I followed the recipe exactly (except I kept the apple peel on) and the results were bitter, grainy and inedible. I woke up to a big disappointment this morning.

I love steel cut oats and was looking forward to having breakfast ready when I woke up. I didn't add the butter since I never add butter when making oats on the stove top. I also only used 1/2 T of cinnamon which ended up being the perfect amount. I also subbed brown sugar for stevia and used craisins for the raisins. I used my 5 qt. Hamilton Beech slow cooker (doesn't cook as hot as others) and cooked for 7 hours. It was mush - didn't have the firm bite I like in steel cut oats. If I make this again I would consider a shorter cooking time. The craisins would have been much better sprinkled on the cooked oats as opposed to adding to the crock.

This is a great way to make oatmeal, but it isn't very healthy if you follow the recipe as it is.
I made these changes to mine;
Omit the butter and brown sugar.
Replace it with an additional Tbsp of cinnamon and 2 Tbsp of Splenda.

Oatmeal is cereal. You wouldn't put butter on your Cheerios would you?

LOVE this recipe!  My kids can make it if I wanted them to and I put in disposable cups and send the kids to school with a hot breakfast.  I don't add any sugar at all, one Splenda and some milk per serving and it is perfect!

YUM! These are delicious!!  I followed the recipe exact for the ingredients but I cooked this on the stove top instead of slow cooking it, according to the directions on the steel cut oats package. It was great, will make this regularly!!

This is really good, I have made steel cut oats on the stove and I like this method much better.  My slow cooker must run on a higher temperature though because it is burning around the sides after 4 hours on low.  Really glad you took the time to share this recipe.

Easy and delish.  I cooked for 7 hours but had it on warm for 1 hour - it was burnt around the edges, but the middle was great.

Holy buckets!! If I could give this recipe more stars, I would!! Just bought a 1.5 quart crock pot for our camper and saw this recipe and gave it a try. I was a little worried as crock pots vary from brand to brand, size to size and this came out PERFECT!! Followed the recipe almost to a "t", adding a little bit more brown sugar, dried cranberries instead of raisins and added some chopped pecans for crunch. Woke up the next morning to a bubbling crock of deliciousness!! WAY better than any instant/stove top/microwave I have ever tried. I'm already thinking about new combinations of dried fruits and nuts! WELL worth getting the bag of steel cut oats for. Heck, get the new little crock pot for this one!! SO glad I did!!

I am surprised at how many good reviews this got. I found it to be a mushy mess. Definitely not enough brown sugar, I added 4T instead of 2. I would also recommend adding a little more water if you like your oats a bit more runny and not in one big clump. The cinnamon could be reduced a bit too. Would not make this again!

Very easy and delicious breakfast! We loved the chunks of apple and raisins, and found it very filling. The only change I made was to increase the brown sugar to 4 tablespoons. We will definitely make this again!

I doubled the recipe and followed as is except substituing dried cranberries for raisins.  Give it a good stir, serve it warm w/ a little milk on top and you've got an easy and yummy hot breakfast.  My 3 teenage boys devoured it!

I found it to be a bit mushier than I like. Perhaps if I reduce the water? 

To prevent sticking and ease washing up, I sprayed the slow cooker bowl with pam. A tip that I found from another recipe.

I was really excited about trying this recipe but it didn't turn out too well for me... The flavors didn't combine well and the oatmeal around the edge of the pot burned.

I thought this had WAY too much cinnamon in it.  It was so awful I ended up throwing the entire batch away.  I'll try it again with half the cinnamon and see how it goes.

I don't understand at all how this recipe got 5 stars.  I followed it as written, using steel cut oats and it turned out to be a gloppy mess with WAY too much cinnamon.  I'm wondering if the recipe should have said 1 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 Tbsp.

This recipe is awesome!  All 4 of my young kids love it, and I completely omit the sugar.  It is still sweet and flavorful.  I use this at least once a week.  It is quick to toss together the night before.  I also add a little extra water, I live in a dry climate.

This recipe is a good starting point.  I followed it just as written, but I still thought it was just OK.  I think you could definitely switch out fruits here.  And I think maybe next time use some milk or half and half.  It was nice to wake up to breakfast, though.  I would warn people to make sure to check your crock pot once the time is over.  Mine switches over to "warm" and it was drying out the oatmeal...luckily I was up and turned it off.

fine. Make sure to try it on low. Warm was too watery. Good, though, later.

My husband and I loved having this ready in the morning when we woke up!  I had read about putting the ingredients in a heat safe bowl and then surround the bowl (about 1/2 way to the top of the bowl) with water in the crockpot.  Cooked perfectly!  I only put the apples and cinnamon in at the beginning and then I added raisins, a dab of maple syrup, a little bit of milk when I was ready to eat and it was perfect to me.  Of course this can be adjusted in so many ways to suit individual tastes.  Thanks for the original recipe and thanks for all the helpful suggestions that have been posted!

After reading all of the reviews for this recipe I decided to make it during the day the first time so that I could monitor its progress.  I cooked the oatmeal on low for 4 hours, stirred it and gave it another half hour and then served it. Pretty good at that point, maybe a bit heavy on the cinnamon, but I really like cinnamon. My Crock Pot brand slow cooker is very low tech so if I want to make this an overnight project I'll cook it on the warm setting instead of low. I think 8 hours on low would have been a disaster.

Made a double batch in my crock pot last night.  Didn't smell it this morning and was worried, but it was done and delicious.  Even my husband who usually has "junk" for breakfast took a container to work. I have been eating roled outs, done in the microwave, but this is my new breakfast fave.  Only change I will make is it add a tsp salt and maybe 1 more tbsp brown sugar.

Offering a suggestion - cut back on the water by about 1/2 - 1 cup and instead of a slow cooker use a rice cooker with a delay to be ready when you wake up.  The bonus is that you will not have a wonderful aroma from that recipe waking you up in the middle of the night when the slow cooker is on - you will just get the aroma close to when wake up time is anyway.  THEN for the 1/2 - 1 cup liquid that is missing, you can add milk - stir and leave warming through for 5 - 10 min.  This is a wonderful recipe otherwise, and as some mentioned can be customized easily.

I tried this last night, and like some other reviewers mine burnt on the outside of the crockpot. I used 1.5c water and 2c 1% milk (this may be the reason it burnt so bad) and I ommited the butter. Instead of raisins I chopped up some dried mango. I cooked mine for 8 hours on low. The salvageable oatmeal was ok and the texture was good but it had the burnt taste. The crockpot is now soaking in hot water for the second time to remove the charcoal. I will definitly try this recipe again but will be putting everything in a pyrex bowl inside the crockpot with water.

We love oatmeal so I really liked the idea of it being ready the next day when I woke up. Definitely needs more sugar but other than that it is a great recipe.

My family and I loved this oatmeal recipe. I added more vanilla, all spice, and sliced bananas. Drizzled honey on top before eating. WONDERFUL!! I am thinking of sqeezing a little fresh orange juice next time. My boys are asking for more.

I read the instructions again to see if I had done something wrong, but as far as I can tell, I cooked it correctly.  This was just too bland, and the texture too gooey for our tastes.

After reading all the other reviews, I decided to be very cautious. I have a manual dial Rival brand 3 1/2 quart crock pot. I was sure to use steel cut oats. I sprayed my crock pot with Pam beforehand and cooked it only on the Warm setting, not Low. It was perfectly done after 4 1/2 hours on the Warm setting. Delicious! I love steel cut oats, but rarely eat them because they take forever on the stove top. This is great! Very easy! Thanks!

Followed the recipe using steel cut oats and it came out perfectly.
Well, it was a tad dry for my taste, but we like to add milk anyway.
I used 1 1/2 Granny Smith apples, cored and peeled.
I also put in a pinch of salt.
Some might like it sweeter or wetter or drier, so try it how it's written and then adjust to your liking and make it the way you prefer next time. Super easy, really yummy and my roommate loved it!
Thanks for the recipe!

Let me start by saying I am  not sure if my rating is a fair one or not. This does not work with large oval slow cookers on steroids. I doubled the recipe considering I have a monster sized crock pot and I did it on low for 7 hours.It came out a mushy mess. Yes, I used steel cut oats. Half of it was stuck to the bottom and sides and slightly burned. I was excited to find this idea and sorry to say, I really think the success depends on your slow cooker. I'm glad it's worked for so many others.

Thank you, brandysue, for this recipe. Oatmeal is so good for you and the steel cut oats are even better, but I don't usually make them  because they take way too long to cook on the stove and I don't have time for that when I have to get off to work in the morning. But, this is a great alternative because I can make a batch that lasts throughout the week where the last serving tastes as good as the first. This recipe is like having dessert for breakfast, but there's no guilt involved.

Cooking the steel-cut oats in the slow cooker overnight is a wonderful idea. I think the recipe works well just as it is, but I did tweak it because I didn't have raisins and I've always preferred milk over water in my oatmeal. 
 
I added dried cranberries, flax seed and an additional 2T brown sugar. I don't think the tablespoon of cinnamon is overpowering at all. Cinnamon is so very good for you (lowers LDL and stabilizes blood sugar) that the more the better, IMHO. The only issue I had was that it stuck big time to my crock pot. I think the pot runs hot, so I will adjust the setting from 'low' to 'warm' next time and spray some Pam on the sides to see if that eliminates the problem. I had also put just a tad of honey in the mix which probably contributed to the sticking, as well. 

I love a recipe that not only tastes good, but is easy to make AND has the benefit of actually being good for you.

Very good.  Made  recipe plus half (for 9 servings).  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  It was a bit crusty around the edges but delicious.  Made as is.  Used milk, mixed dried berries, apples.  Kids loved it.  Nice to wake up too on a cold Saturday.

This is simply delicious! in my version, I cut out the sugar because it just doesnt need it with all the other goodies in there. The apple is just a genius idea! I also used coconut oil instead of butter. Oh and last but not least, I made this in my RICE COOKER!!!! My slow cooker is much too large to put a single or double serving of oatmeal, so my husband suggested the rice cooker. I threw everything in when I woke up and it was ready to eat after my shower. Ive made it the last 2 days, always making enough for my mid morning snack as well. I am just so incredibly happy to have found a way to make steelcut oatmeal so easily!

This is a great recipe! Followed the directions to the letter, but added dried cherries instead of raisins - turned out great. One tip I got from my boss - soak the steel cut oats overnight in a bowl of water, then dump in a strainer and rinse. It takes out alot of the starch and you end up with a lighter fluffy oatmeal thats not so heavy. Use 3 cups liquid because the oats have already absorbed moisture from the leaching process. Next time I'll try soy milk.

Fantastic! We really enjoyed this. I used 10oz of apple juice in place of the water & chopped, dried cherries because I didn't have raisins. I used 2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of a full tbsp of cinnamon. Glad I did it that way because I think it old have been too much for my taste. 
Due to time constraints, I started it on high for an hour then turned to low for three hours. It wasn't quite redy then, but after sitting in the fridge overnight, it was perfect.

I made this with steel cut oats and even though I lightly coated the crock pot with oil, it really stuck and was a pain to clean.  The stuck parts burned a little and gave a bitter taste to the whole dish. Some other reviewers mentioned trying the bowl inside the crock pot - I'll try this next time. I really like the idea of it and it made the house smell really good in the morning.

Taste okay, but texture was mushy which I suspect was from too much water at the beginning.  I've made other slow cooker oatmeal, with the same oats, with much better results.

This did not turn out well.  Next time I'll just settle making regular oatmeal on the stove.  The raisins turned out like grapes and had an odd flavor to them.  I'd suggest adding the raisins at the end after it finished cooking.

So I was intrigued by all the flip flopping reviews and did a sort of experiment. I've made this recipe twice. First time, I used regular stove top oats and got a result very much like what others have said, oats were mushy and floating in a liquid when I woke up. I transferred the oats to a pan, set it on the stove, and added another cup of oats. Fixed it right up, turned it into oatmeal, and tasted great. So, even if you get that result, it's easy to fix. The next time, I had my husband get steel cut/Irish oats. Since I live right next to Ireland, they were actually Irish oats from Ireland. And I did what any smart cooky would do: I read the package on what ratio of water to oats these oats needed. It was very close to what is required in this recipe. So I used the steel cut oats the next time, and got a VERY DIFFERENT result when I woke up. It looked like oatmeal! It was not surrounded by liquid, and looked like the picture in the recipe. It tasted great!

I actually might add a bit more water or milk to the recipe if I make it again as I think it was a bit too little for my oats.

So, before you rate and review, make sure that your "really wrong" ratios are actually that & compare the package instructions and the recipe itself; that's probably the best way to tell if you're actually using steel cut/Irish oats, which are NOT the same as the five minute stove top quick oats. IF your particular brand of oats is off from the recipe a bit, try using the package ratio instead.

This makes such a delicious and filling breakfast.  I do make some changes.  You absolutely must grease the crock either with spray or lots of butter.  Definitely use milk instead of water to obtain more of a creamy oatmeal.  I usually don't measure the apple, just chop up one of whatever I have on hand.  I double the brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  It helps bring out the sweetness.  Substitute craisins for raisins.  I also chop up some walnuts and toast them in a pan for a few minutes.  Top the oatmeal with that for a little nutty crunch.

For my desired texture, I like the oats completely cooked, no bite left in them.  To achieve that it takes at least 8 hours.  Just set the crock to cook on low for 8 hours and I wake up to a perfect breakfast.  

I  live by myself and there's no way I could even come close to eating all that the recipe yields.  So I buy cheapy plastic containers, (1 cup size).  After it's made I fill up the containers, it usually fills about 8, and freeze.  I take one out on my way to work and microwave for a minute or so and it tastes just as great as the morning I made it.

WAAAY too much liquid, and not enough sweetness for my liking! I might try it one more time with less liquid; and I will use half water and half apple juice.

This was good the second time I made it. I really recommend cutting the cinnamon to a teaspoon and adding a bit of salt. The first time I made it, I substituted Apple cider for ALL of the water. Big mistake--too much Apple flavor. Someone suggested milk instead of water so I will try that next time. Cranberries are a nice substitute for raisins.  They could be added after cooking, as could the apples to add different textures.

Loved it!!!! Never tried steel cut oats before-very impressed!! did as a reviewer mentioned...used 1C milk as a sub for one of the cups of water.  May even do more next time.  It was delicious.  We put it on low for what we hoped would be 8 hours overnight.  However our daughter decided to sleep in so they were in for over 9 hours! Still great! can't wait to make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was great, but my husband didn't like it. I omitted the brown sugar and raisins, and used 2 c. water and 1 1/2 c. milk. Also used a slow cooker liner as others had suggested, which was a godsend! Cooked on low for 8 hours overnight. I added toasted pecans and plain greek yogurt to mine-YUM!

I decreased the Cinnamon to 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp.  I cook it 3 hours on low in my crockpot and then turn it off and let it cool in the pot, that way it does not stick to the sides.  I love this recipe and now keep a batch in my fridge ready to warm up for B-fast.

This recipe was tasty, but the "cook on warm if your crockpot cooks too high" advice didn't work so well for my crock pot. After 7 hours on warm, they weren't really done, so I put them on low for two more hours. I think in the future I might try low on a few hours before bed, and then switch to warm overnight.

All I had was rolled oats, so despite the aggressive warnings I went for it anyway. I also get paranoid about things burning in the slow cooker (mine doesn't seal that well) so I added an extra half cup of water, which was good. Yes, it was mushy -- more of a cream of wheat consistency, but it tasted wonderful and my family was delightfully surprised. Definitely a keeper!!

I will never fix this again; mushy and tasteless.  I even used milk instead of most of the water but out of a family of 5, no one would eat it.  It wasn't the least bit sweet, either.

I greased my slow cooker pot and this stuck something aweful to it. I soaked and scrubbed it for so long, it was not worth it! The cinnamon cooked for that long gave a strange flavor. It's better to make this on the stove in 25 minutes.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and we thought it was very good.  I just finished putting it in the crockpot tonight. This time I put in more apple (2 small galas), more raisens (1/2 cup) and another tablespoon of sugar.  We will see how this turns out.  It was delicious the first time, but we customized it to our own taste this time.  I can't wait to experiment with different fruits and nuts.

I made this recipe this afternoon so I could see how it behaves. It took exactly 6 hours for a nice, creamy consistency. It's 8 pm and I can't stop 'tasting' it. I used half water and half unsweetened apple juice, and one large apple coarsely chopped. It tastes great and I'm looking forward to breakfast being ready for the week. I might use a bit less cinnamon next time. Thanks for the yummy, healthy recipe!

I'm glad I found this! It's a hearty, warm, and EASY breakfast during cold winter months. I love that I can start it the night before and wake up to the delicious smell of cinnamon and apples cooking! I've made it twice so far...the first time exactly by the recipe and it was delicious! The second time I omitted raisins (per request of my 3 year old) and brown sugar, just b/c I dislike adding sugar to anything for breakfast. I think it really needs both of those ingredients though. We ended up adding a lil sugar to our bowls.

I am not a fan of this recipe. The slow cooker took all of the "chew" out of the steel cut oats. With the raisins and the apples, this was mush. I didn't want to throw it out so I added brown sugar, old fashioned oats, and chopped pecans for texture. I think maybe 4-6 hours on low would have been long enough cooking time. Also, I would add cinnamon to the final product; this looked burnt when i added the cinnamon at the beginning of the cooking time.

No way you could cook this overnight! Mine was done in an hour and a half at the most (on low)! I just did steel cut oats and water so my kids could add what they like. Turned out ok just mine cooked way faster than stated!

Great recipe, I used half milk half water and used cranberries instead of raisins, omitted the vanilla only because I didn't have it on hand and it was still wonderful. Doubled the recipe for potluck and my co-workers loved it.

Oh my goodness, so good! Used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon, and added a pinch of salt. You can prevent sticking by using the butter to grease the crockpot. Doubled the recipe as another reviewer suggested...husb and I work nightshifts and its nice to set aside some individual portions to freeze and take to work.

Used the steel cut oats and cooked exactly 8 hours on low with a crockpot liner.  It came out BURNT and inedible.  The burnt taste was overpowering. I've not noticed my crockpot running too hot for any other recipes.  The apples were mush, and the raisins too :(    I would recommend trying this on the Warm setting the first time you make it. You can always throw it in a pot in the morning and cook it more, but my batch ended up in the garbage can.

I finally found an overnight oatmeal recipe in the crock pot that works! I added 1/2 cup of more liquid (3 cups of water and 1 cup of almond milk), I added 2 ripe bananas (mashed), a heaping spoonful of almond butter and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and a handful of pecans. I also kept it on warm the whole cooking time (@10 hours) and it didn't scorch, perfect consistency.

I made this recipe with equal parts liquid to steel cut oats and it definitely should be a 3:1 ratio, as it was dry. But it's nothing you can't fix by either adding liquid to the crockpot or adding milk to your bowl. The spices were a hit.

The whole family loves this.  I use half water and half milk.  I also only turn the crockpot on warm but for 10 hours.  We prefer it without the apples.

I have never had steel cut oats before.  But my mother gave me some and I found this recipe to try them out with.  
I modified it a little (for lack of rasins).
So I traded 1/2 cup of raisins for 1/2 cup of craisins and chopped candied ginger.  Everything else was the same and I was eating it right out of my Crock Pot ^_^. Oh, I let it cook on low for 6.5 hours.
This one's a keeper.

1 tab coconut oil in place of one of the tabs. butter.   More than enough cranberries so next time will cut those in half to save on the carbs.  Remove from crock when done or they will tighten up and become too thick; however I remedied that with some half n half.  All in all it was delicious and will be making this a lot.

I have made this repeatedly after buying steel cut oats, then finding out how long you have to cook and stir, lol! These cook in about 3 hours on low in my crockpot which tends to cook everything too quickly. So I make a batch during the day, then store it in the fridge. Single servings can be reheated in the microwave in about a minute. Great for breakfast or an evening treat. My husband and I both love it, especially when you leave the apples a little chunky. Delicious! Our little 2 year old grandson was here one day as the oats finished cooking and he gobbled a bowl down. A healthy treat!

Ok, we didn't like this at all. Hubby couldn't eat it (he's never had steel cut oats before) he did not care for the gummy texture. I just personally like a more spiced apple taste and I didn't even think of that when making this. This was just very bland and the apple taste was a little weird. I might make this again but I'll add nutmeg or allspice and I'm curious to see if cooking for less then 7 hours will help with the texture.

I made this last night for breakfast this morning. As I sit here eating this, I think it's a good recipe, but I made a change which I regret. I followed the recipe exactly as far as proportions, but instead of water I added half water, half almond milk. I dislike the taste of almond milk, and I hate wasting food, so I was trying to find a use for the almond milk. Another reviewer used almond milk, so I tried it. I can still taste the almond milk. I was hoping the apple, raisins, and cinnamon would mask it. They did, but not enough. I will make this again, but I will use only water. I still gave the recipe five stars because of the ease of the preparation, the texture when finished, and if I subtract the taste of the almond milk, I like it. Steel cut oats are a pain to make on the stove top, so slow cooking them with fresh ingredients is fantastic! The house smelled wonderful as the oats cooked, and like I said, I will make this again (and again).

Warning!: ORIGINAL RECIPE IS SUPER BLAND. Nowhere near enough brown sugar. Think more like 1/3 cup for this much oatmeal. While you're at it, go ahead and reduce the cinnamon to maybe 1.5 tsp. and use a 50/50 mix of water and milk to cook, or use all apple juice (it gives great flavor, especially when making apple pie oatmeal). If you wake up to a too hot, too mushy and stiff oatmeal, just add in some cold milk and it will break up the texture while, at the same time, cooling it down. One last nugget of slow cooker oatmeal truth: It may just be my slow cooker, but I feel like the apples in this were overcooked and the sides of my oatmeal were a tad burnt when I left it in at 5.5 hours. If you have this issue, I'd suggest cooking on low for 3 hours and leaving on warm all night.

This came out great, although each serving needed a pinch of salt. I wonder if some people are using QUICK COOKING steel cut oats, and that's why it was mushy for them. It took less time than the recipe. It got thicker as it sat in the fridge.

My kids and I love this oatmeal.  Using steel cut oats instead of rolled oats is vital, as is greasing the crock pot vessel.  We like ours with a teaspoon of nutmeg and a dash of salt added, but the original recipe is great as is.

My husband doesn't like homemade oatmeal, and he really liked this!  I made a few adjustments as follows: 2 cups almond milk and 1 cup water, 1 cup steel oats, 1 chopped up gala apple (all I had), only 1 TBSP of cinnamon (PLENTY), doubled the brown sugar to 4 TBSP, 1 tsp vanilla, and the 2 TBSP of butter. I set it to warm before I went to bed around midnight, and it was creamy and delicious around 8:00 this morning. I added a few pecans, dried cranberries, and a packet of Sugar in the Raw to my bowl. The Sugar in the Raw is a coarser, natural sugar that is light golden brown in color, but I think is not brown sugar. It really makes a difference in a good way!!

I tried this recipe for the first time last night.  I wqs concerned about the overnight time because my crock pot tends toward the hot side even on low and doesn't have a timer or warm setting.  The other concern that I had was the amount of cinnamon and that one turned out to be the biggest one.  The cinnamon just overwhelms eveythng else.

Even though I had read a few reviews I neglected to put any salt in and I think that would help a lot.  What I will change for next time - reduce cinnamon by half, substitute some milk for some of the water, add maybe a tsp of salt and increase the brown sugar by 1 or 2 TBSP.

I thought it was good, but should've read the reviews before I made it for the fam.  I LOVE SCOs, so this was perfect for us.  Consistency is so much better than the rolled oats.  But the changes I would make (same as other readers) is to double the recipe to avoid the blackening (didn't do much for the presentation or the taste!), put the raisins in AFTER it's done, may try it on "warm" setting for a little longer instead of "low" to see if that helps the burning. And lastly, will try to make it with half of a kind of milk and water... almond, coconut or cow's milk for a creamier texture.  But other than that, I loved it.  Perfect for our Sunday mornings when we have to get out the door and get to church on time with 4 little ones!!

I won't be making this again. The consistency turned out fine but I wish I would've added alot more apples for taste. Yes, it was bland but then again it's oatmeal. If you don't have a programmable crockpot that will automatically turn off after 6 or 8 hours I would hesitate on trying it overnight for fear it will burn.

I will make this again! I made it exactly as the recipe called for. ~~ Everyone's tastes are different, for me I wanted it just a bit sweeter, so I added some brown sugar at the end. ~~ Here's my only issue with a lot of overnight crock pot recipes, not just this one ... I go to bed (am at least settled) by 9 pm each evening, and am up around 6am .. that is 9 hours. My crock pot has a timer, and after the time is up it switches to "warm". Last night, I put it in at 9am for 5.5 hours (figuring the warm setting would be fine) and happened to wake up at 3am for cold medicine - I could smell the wonderful oatmeal, so I went to check on it, and it was done, so I turned the crock off. Never the less - by 7am (breakfast time) it was still a bit too "overdone" -- I do not fault the recipe for that, because if I could have served it right when it was done at 3am it would have been perfect! It's just a byproduct of "overnight" slow cooking I guess.

First time I made this recipe I found it had just a little too much of a  cinnamon taste for my liking. Next batch I reduced the cinnamon by half and it turned out perfect for my taste. I highly recommend this recipe especially on those cold mornings. As an added twist slice up and add a banana just before serving.

Made this as the recipe indicated. Significant sticking so don't cook this longer than indicated. Once I stirred it up and added artificial sweetener, it was amazing. I used golden raisins and one cut up crisp pink apple.

I cooked it overnight and tried it this morning.  It was ok, but I won't repeat it.  If you are short on time and don't like to make breakfast, try baked oatmeal instead.  It's flavor is excellent, and imagine you could re-heat it, plus added fruit.

OMG,  what a mess I woke up to this morning.  I followed the directions exactly, using steel cut oats and subbing craisins.  Started it before bed, and woke up to a dark brown, soupy, mushy mess. The craisins had all burnt. Will never make again.

Loved it!  I made it as the recipe stated and then added chopped walnuts on top. I’m going to try apple juice next time. I pretty much fed my kids flourless and eggless for breakfast and was ok with it. Chocolate chips would probably taste good but then it would definitely be a dessert.

This was my first time trying slow cooker steel oats and it did not turn out as expected.   I had it on low for 8 hours and it looked burnt around the edges and way too thick.  After looking at other similar recipes, I believe the liquid amount is way off - should have added at least another 1.5 cups.  I also cut back on the cinnamon as it just seemed like way too much.  I did not add the apples but added twice the raisins.  It was edible but just.  This recipe really needs doctoring in my opinion.

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast. I was not disappointed with the outcome, but I recommend the minimum cook time to maintain the integrity of the steel cut. Also, the recipe does not call for the addition of salt, and we all know oats are a bit flat without it, so I highly recommend adding it! My husband doesn’t like raisins, so I left them out. The sweetness they would have provided could be compensated with a little additional brown sugar.

Excellent flavor and texture! Super easy breakfast to prepare the night before and have ready for overnight guests who like to get up much earlier than their grandparents.  My 7 yo and 9 yo grandsons helped themselves (with supervision) to three large bowls Christmas morning BEFORE opening gifts. 

I lined my crockpot with a bag to save on the mess. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and half unflavored  almond milk and half water. I  made a recipe and a half because I wanted to have enough for the four adults, too. I will definitely make this my go-to oatmeal recipe.

good on flavor but seemed overcooked.   I used the steel cut oats.  7 hours seemed too long. if i try this recipe again, i'll try half the time.  it was just a mushy mess.  :\

Good recipe as is. I've been making it for a few weeks. Last night I felt the need for a little more flavor -- so I used Apple Pie spice. Wow! what a pop of flavor!

I found that this recipe cooked in 6hrs in my old slow cooker without burning or sticking. I only used 1 T. of brown sugar and added stevia to sweeten when I served it.  I also added 1/2 c. extra water & 3 T. of flax meal before cooking. The raisins, I added after cooking along with a dollop of yogurt. I can see making this again as it was tasty and easy to make.

Perfect as laid out! I thought no salt would be bland, but it was fine! I used my Instapot on slowcooker setting on "less" for 8 hours and programmed it to start at 11:15pm. It was exactly ready at 7:15am for breakfast! Delicious! One personal tweak- a bit too much cinnamon for me. I think I will half that and add a dash of nutmeg next time.

The first time I tried this recipe, it didn't quite turn out as expected. It was really sticky, and much of the oats stuck to the bottom. Undaunted, I tried again - this time with a few little tweaks - and the second time was the charm! Here's what worked for me: To one cup of STEEL CUT OATS, I added 3.5 cups of water with .5 cup of juice from canned peaches, two cinnamon sticks, some vanilla extract, a dash of salt, and a dribble of maple syrup. I set my crockpot to WARM (not low) for about 6.5 hours. The result was perfect. I added brown sugar, walnuts, milk, and some blueberries to the finished product. YUM!

Fabulous!  Next time I will cut in half since it's just for me to take to work.  Instead of the raisins, I put dried cranberries.   Also, I took this ingredient from another similar recipe: (1) anise star.  Really adds a nice kick if you like that flavor.  So YUMMY.

First time to cook steel oats and it came out so delicious. It cooked for 5 hours.I made 2 changes,I used milk, instead of water and decreased the cinnamon to less than half the amount. Came out very good. Will  do again.

I would add more water, less sugar and some salt. It also lacks milk, in my opinion. The regular oatmeal I usually cook on a stove tastes much better for me, and it's not time-consuming at all.

I personally didn't mind it. I had to add a scoop of sugar to have some flavor. Before adding sugar it was kind of bland. My kids did not enjoy it at all, not even with sugar. My fiance took one bite and instantly threw it away. I would definitely add some sugar in it while cooking to create a yummy sweet taste.

I haven't made this yet, but I really want to try it.  My question is how long can I actually cook it? We usually don't eat breakfast until around nine. According to the recipe, that would mean I'd have to get up around 1 in the morning to turn on the crock pot.  Do any of you have any suggestions?

Good recipe but instead of steel cut, I recommend using stone ground oats (sometimes called Scottish style) and cut the cooking time in half since ground whole oats are in smaller pieces than steel cut. I did reduce the raisins which I thought would predominate too much. I saw someone post that they normally cook oats in 5 minutes which means they don't usually use steel cut oats. You cannot use 'rolled oats' (which are actually pre-cooked) in this recipe. They will not

Made it as directed and it was very tasty! Its still oatmeal, let's be honest, so don't expect to be singing from the rooftops, but I liked it. I was afraid it would be waaay too cinnamon-y judging by how dark brown it became, but I think it was just right. This was also my first experience with steel-cut oats so I wasn't sure what to expect, but again, very yummy after 5 hours in the slow cooker. Next time I think I will double the apple, but that's just because I love apples. Also grateful for my apple machine that makes peeling, slicing, and coring my apples so easy, so this was a nice fast recipe.

This is the 2nd recipe I've tried making steel cut oats in a crock pot.  (the first was blueberry banana but we won't go there).This is also the 2nd time I've done this recipe with a few very minor changes.
1)I used a crock pot liner (Reynolds).  Worked great, no mess. 
2) I used one granny smith apple.  I used one of those corer/slicers that you push down on the apple and slices it into 8 slices.  Cut each slice into 4-5 pieces and added them in the pot with the skin on.  I figure that they cook for 8 hours, who's going to care that the peel was left on?
3)I used 1 1/2 cups of water and 2 cups of almond milk.  I'm not sure why I use almond milk.  The recipes I first looked at called for almond milk.  I guess it's supposed to be good for you like steel cut oats.
4)I used craisins instead of raisins because raisins will kill my dog.
5)I used 1 Tbsp of apple pie spice instead of cinnamon.  The spice also has nutmeg and allspice in it as well as cinnamon.  I figured it wouldn't hurt.
I turned this on before bed and had a bowl when I got up in the morning.  I left a note telling my wife it was really good and enjoy it but she overslept and only had time to turn the crock pot off before going to work.  I tossed the liner and untouched oatmeal in the trash when I came home.  That is one reason why I'm making it again.  Another reason is it's so gosh darn good!

It was very delicious. I usually like my oatmeal made with milk so it tasted a little watery to me but I’ll just do half and half of water and milk next time! Other than that it’s amazing!

I make this a lot.   I have made it for a quilting get-together and it was well received.  Friends have a bakery area in their farm stand and work all night baking pies at Thanksgiving and I make this for all the workers.   All the fixings for this has been sent with my husband to his gaming weekend with 6 guys.  They devoured it.  It is a nice feeling to wake up and go downstairs to this heavenly smell.

This is a very good recipe. For those among us who appreciate a hot breakfast especially on cold winter days, I encourage you to make this recipe.  I doubled the recipe using the online adjuster and stored the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.  Microwaved portions reheat well.  I also used this recipe for organic oat groats - simply replacing the steel cut oats with organic oat groats and increasing the water in the recipe by 1/2 cup.

What could be better than coming into your kitchen smelling this wonderful hot breakfast on a very cold morning? I followed the recipe adding a spoonful of organic honey. Delicious! We were happy to have enough for a couple of days just heating it in the microwave oven.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I only made one change and not sure if that was one or not.  It calls for 1 cup chopped apples, so I chopped up one gala and one granny smith, probably more than a cup I did not measure. I have a really plain crockpot, just 2 settings, low and high.  I cooked it appx 7 hours on low and it was perfect.  Used a crockpot liner, so got every bit.  Reheats nicely.  My hubby and I are both type 2 diabetics and this did not raise our blood sugar, so bonus for that!  Will be making this often!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I’ve gotta say this... I was absolutely hating having to make this. Why? Because the last time I had oats I was 5 (44 years ago lol) and I swore to my mom that I’d go hungry before I ever choked them down again. 
Fast forward and a new diet with meal prepping has taken place and I’m amazed how delicious this is! I used 2.5 cups unsweetened almond milk and 1.5 cups of water, did not add raisins, used light brown sugar,  and everything else the recipe calls for. I sprayed the crock pot with Pam and cooked on low for a little over 5 hours (cooked during the day so I could keep track of it). My serving size turned out to be about 3/4 cup and there were 6 servings. I sprinkled 1tsp of chia seeds over each serving before refrigerating. I’m sure I’ll add a bit of almond milk when I reheat the oats but the sweetness, cinnamon and apple flavors were all perfect! Adding up what I used, each serving including chia seeds is 147 calories. Nutritious, tasty breakfast

First Attempts In Learning! I added about one-half cup more apple and I think that added too much extra liquid. It cooked on low for 7 hours, but that wasn’t enough to thicken the oatmeal as shown in the recipe photo. The color was dark brown, which surprised me. However, The flavor was very tasty good. I will try again with adjustments following the exact recipe.

I made this overnight in my rice cooker set to warm. I used one cup steel cut oats, two cups almond milk, two snack boxes of craisins, two snack containers of cinnamon applesauce, and a tablespoon of stevia. It cooked perfectly. (Note: one cup = the cup that comes with the rice cooker)

I wanted to try a healthy option for breakfast that wouldn't cause a problem. I also only wanted to use my little crock, rather than my 5 or 6 quart pot. (Yeah I have multiple crock pots)

Oye.

First, how do you know if your slow cooker cooks hot? Well make this..because if it turns into a boiling..yes burned mess...well it cooks hot. (I also have 5 burned fingers from this fiasco) I now feel like a candidate for worst cooks in America. Anne Burrell is going to be knocking on my door.

So my advice, if you make this.. Make sure you have a crock with a warm setting.

The end result that wasn't stuck to my crock was good, but on top of it all runny. I would say it might need more oats than directed, because a 6-7 hour cook time should have produced firm oats and mine was full of cinnamon soup.

The taste was very good though, but I think I'll be hesitant to do oatmeal in a slow cooker again

This was fantastic!  I did 2 c. almond milk and 1.5 c. water, plus 1 tbsp ground flax. Used a Gala apple (bc that's what we had on hand) and the maple syrup instead of brown sugar;  normally I like to dump the brown sugar on after it's cooked, along with some milk, but I found it sweet enough that it didn't need any extra sugar at all! Hooray!
The amount of cinnamon was fantastic as well.  
Because I'd made slow cooker oatmeal before and found it to burn on the edges, this time, I tried 2 hours on Low, then turned it to Warm while we slept.  It was a little crusty on the edges when we woke up, but not burnt.  

And hey,  I found a trick on the internet for help with the burnt-on, caked-on remainder, and it works like a charm!

"The Crock-Pot Ladies recommend sprinkling baking soda onto stuck-on food before scrubbing. If that doesn't work, their second course of action is to pour 1/4 cup of baking soda into the ceramic pot, fill it with water, and add a dash of dish soap. Then cover it and set on high for 2-4 hours."

Used 4 cups of water, and it was a good consistency, maybe even a little thicker than we'd typically like.  Put on "keep warm" in my crockpot for around 8 hours.  Kids loved this, need to double sugar at least.  Served with some sprinkled on top, a little cream/milk, and pecans.

This recipe was a big hit for our group, which included children who were very picky eaters.  I doubled the recipe which still fit nicely into my standard Crock Pot.  A big Granny Smith Apple gave the oatmeal a nice flavor without being sweet.  Next time I will try a Golden Delicious to see how a sweeter apple works.  Highly recommend this recipe!

Made this last night and OH WOW is all I can say! It is wonderfully filling and so delicious!  I added a T spoon of butter to my three large scoops, a T sugar and about 1/4 c milk. My husband loved it and wants me to make more and refrigerate to have bowls on demand. One thing I did was add 1/2 c more Brown Sugar and a T vanilla instead of a t spoon. I also used Granny smith apples.

Delicious! Made using milk rather than water (personal preference). I did not add raisins or cranberries, but did use two small Gala apples (w/o skin). Needed a little salt. Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe 4 times now because it is easy to reheat, quick to make, and my boyfriend will eat it too! We usually split the liquid to half water and half milk and don't add raisins to the recipe. My partner adds the raisins on top afterwards. I usually also add yogourt, walnuts and pumpkin seeds on top to make it a bit hardier as a breakfast. 
Usually it's a bit runny when it's done in the slow cooker but it ends up being really thick after sitting in the fridge for a bit! It also sticks to the crockpot and is a pain to clean, even if you use a non-stick spray on it.

I used 3.5 cups of apple juice instead of water+ nutmeg/cinnamon+1 apple+raisins.  There was no sticking to the pot without using cooking spray or a liner.  Left the slower cooker on  warm for eight hours.  Very good, but very filling.  Will make again and eat less :)

This is a great way to make oatmeal. It was delicious!
I added sprouted sunflower seeds, soaked chia seeds, honey, coconut oil,    With the apples it nearly tasted as good as dessert, was delectable and delicious.

I thought this looked like a great way to prepare my daily oatmeal, but was disappointed in the textureless slop that resulted. Despite using steel cut oats and essentially sticking to recipe (replaced water with almond milk/milk combo, and used cruising rather than raisins) the finished product was more like a pureed paste (guess it would make a good baby food, but my kids are long past That! )
My husband was so turned off by the colour he resisted tasting it, then when he did, said it tasted like applesauce gone wrong, not oatmeal. Now I have the fun of cleaning the slow cooker, yeah

This  was very delicious and flavorful.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins; I loved the subtle contrast between the sweet and tart.  I would suggest either using about 1-1/2 cups of the oats.  I feel that the end product was a little too much starch and not enough substance (the oats).  Also, I wouldn't cook it past 8 hours on low in my slow cooker.  I achieved a softer texture after about 6 hours.  I lost about 1/3 of my product because it stuck to the slow cooker.

Sooo good.  My husband can't get enough.
I did increase the brown sugar to 1 cup; the first time I made the recipe we didn't think it was sweet enough with only the 2 tablespoons.  With that tweak, perfection!

We made the recipe as suggested.  We decided we loved the idea of crock pot oatmeal, but this was not our recipe.  I'd just remove everything but the oatmeal and fluids.  I'd add the extras next morning.  Will try that next time.

Delicious!  I made the recipe with only 2 changes suggested by others: used dried cranberries instead of raisins (because I did not have any), and used 2 cups vanilla coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups water and added a pinch of salt. I was most concerned with how long to cook it and read at least 25 reviews to get a sense of cooking time.  I went with cooking it in my 2 qt slow cooker on warm over night.  Put it together and turned it on around 9 pm, got up at 7 am- perfect!!! Definitely use "steel cut oats" for this recipe.  They can stand up to the cooking time.  So happy I found this recipe!

I made a double batch and used 4 cups water and 4 cups apple juice  , 2 c steel cut oats, 2 apples chopped, 1 T cinnamon, 1/4 t salt, 2 t vanilla, 4 T butter.  My crock-pot cooks very hot, so I cooked it on warm 2 hours and then low 2 hours.  I put it in the fridge, it still had some liquid on top.  And then the next morning got it out and put it on warm for 2 more hours.  Perfect!

This is my go to recipe for a nice warm breakfast!  I make it as listed or sometime exchange the apples and raisins for other dried fruits (apricots is another favorite).  I have a 2qt crock pot and use the "warm" setting rather than low.  Can't thank  you enough for posting!

I love oatmeal and I hated this recipe. It was more like soup than oatmeal and was pretty bland. I ended up using it as a topping to my regular steel cut oats and still it wasn't that great. Pass. Or use more oats than called for here.

Here are the adaptations I made to this recipe:

1. I did not peel my apples. Just diced them and threw them into the Crock pot.
2. I left out the brown sugar and found the raisins to be  enough of a sweetener.
3. I added sliced almonds (1 c.) to boost the protein.
4. Divided it to 5 servings of 3/4 c. each.

I'm not sure if I used the wrong size slow cooker but this didn't turn out for me. My slow cooker is quite big and when it was done the oatmeal just barely covered the bottom of the dish. It was all dried up when finished, I had to keep adding milk (and I mean a LOT of milk) to make this edible. It seemed to make a concentrated oatmeal.

I love this tasty oatmeal. I especially enjoy the ease of making it when we have overnight guests.  And all our guests have loved this yummy breakfast. I often leave out the raisins because my husband doesn't enjoy them, but it's still just as tasty! I even safe the leftovers and enjoy it for several more mornings.

This did not go over well with my family of oatmeal lovers. The steel cut oats came out gummy and the cinnamon was overpowering. I would cut back to a half teaspoon if I used it in cooked oatmeal again. It gave an unappealing dark color and the apples lost their taste.

Have made it several times with changes. Deleted the apples, increased the liquid to 4 cups (3 cups water and 1 cup whole milk), replaced ground cinnamon with 3 cinnamon sticks,  replaced brown sugar with Truvia Baking Blend, have made with Craisins and Raisins, plus I do not like my oatmeal creamy, so reduced the cook time to 3 1/2 hrs.

I thought this was great. I hardly ever have time to cook in the morning so this was perfect since I just set it up the night before and let it cook. I added some agave nectar and 3 tablespoons flaxseed.

Tried it with craisins instead of raisins, and plan on trying other dried fruits in future! 
Recipe is definitely a keeper!
Making it now every Sunday night to have for quick and ready breakfast in the week!
What a delicious way to start your day!

It was great as is. I would occasionally vary the fruits and would make a 50% increase in cinnamon (but that is just me). The only other comment is that I would definitely line the cooker with aluminum foil. It is a game changer.

My first time trying slow cooker oats and I am impressed! There are a few tweaks I would try next time, but overall this is a very good recipe. If you don't already I would recommend a liner for your slow cooker, this stuff gets sticky!

I used a crock pot liner (of course... love these) added cranberries instead of raisins  and doubled the entire recipe. Cooked it on low and it was amazing! Everyone loved it 
 I will be making this again.

If your thinking of using regular oats...DON'T!! I made this with regular oats because I didn't have steel oats. BIG MISTAKE.  It was very gelatinous. I was so disappointed because it smelled so good. Next time I will use the right oats.

The flavor and smell was incredible. I guess it's not fair to give only 3 stars seems how now I see I used the wrong kind of oats. I will make again but double the rolled oats as it was very wet. This recipe should work for either steel cut or rolled, I just wish I'd recognized it before I made it.

I followed the directions exactly as posted and let it cook for 8 hours in the crock pot because I like a softer oat. The oats burned themselves to the bottom of my crock pot and left an apple syrup on top.  The apples and raisins have most of the flavor cooked right out of them. Complete disappointment.

I had really high hopes but this did not turn out well.  I made the recipe exactly as written substituting some craisins for the raisins. When I came down this morning it looked like, well, slop.  It definitely had too much water in it, the edges had burnt, the apples were mushy - it just wasn't good.  I will not make this again.

I made this dish after seeing all of the good feedback. However, I did not like it. I followed the recipe step-by-step and I loved waking up to the smell of the oatmeal, but the flavor was very bland. I had to add a few tsp of sugar and butter just to make it eatable for myself.

I doubled the recipe because my crockpot is large and cooked it 8 hours on low as some recommended.  The only other change I made was using chopped prunes instead of raisins.
I loved it right out of the crockpot.  (My husband added a touch more brown sugar!)  The oatmeal I made looks just like the photo.

excellent healthy option for a breakfast of champions...or a pre-gym workout for extra energy!
This is very tasty and simple!

I did not cook mine for 6 hours though, i loved the consistency after 2 hours of cooking. Made it twice and the second time i added 1/2 teaspoon of each clove & nutmeg to add spice and depth of flavour.

I doubled the recipe.  I sprayed my  pot with Pam, set it on low and cooked it for 7 hours.  It is runny  with chunks of burnt oatmeal.  The taste is way to bland!  I made pumpkin oatmeal last week in my crock pot from an Allrecipe recipe and it was delicious. I double checked the ingredients to see I doubled it correctly and I had.

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  It turned out more like soup than oatmeal (and I did use good quality steel cut oats) and has a terrible after taste.  The only thing good about the recipe was that my house smells good.  We had to toss it.

i probably wont make it again because it was a bit bland and i could not figure out what was missing to make it more "bursting" with flavor.

followed the recipe, but had a manual slow cooker, so it did cook the full 8 hours.  Couldn't get up earlier, went to bed late.  It was really awesome.  I was raised eating oatmeal and a side of bacon, I always crumbled my bacon up into my oatmeal.  This recipe was even better when i crumbled my bacon up in it.  Just Awesome!

Oh, this stuff is good... I add more raisins, cranberry raisins, any kind of fruit - I also added the dredges of a bottle of maple syrup and WOW, that was great. But don't use the fake stuff - I tried it again with maple-flavored stuff and it tasted almost chemical-ish. I think I'm going to see how much fruit I can put in.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did not include the raisins.  I also used 1 teaspoon instead of tablespoon of cinnamon. I prefer a more subtle cinnamon flavor. I will make this again, but I need a timer to start my crockpot later at night. It was overcooked around the edges.  This may have been due my individual crockpot's temperature, but I think an hour less cooking time would be better.

I made this exactly as specified with the steel cut oats, and was not a fan. The consistency was fine, but it lacked flavor. I was surprised that  with all of the awesome ingredients that it was so flavorless. I will not be making this one again.

I made this as is, and it was great! However, please note it is not sweet in the way most oatmeal is made. If you want a sweeter oatmeal you will need to add more sugar and a little salt. I really enjoyed it as is. It was a nice, fresh change and very easy to make. I will definitely be using this one again.

I tried to make this for a large group by increasing amounts in a 1:1 ratio and it was a soupy mess. It might be good for one serving, but not good for increasing the amounts.

I doubled the recipe for my gang.  It was oat soup.  Way too much liquid for only 2 cups of oats.  I cooked a pot of oats on the stove and added it in, then it was edible; had to add sugar and I'd cut back a bit on the cinnamon if I ever tried this again.  Was hoping for a good Christmas Eve no fuss breakfast, so much for that idea!

I really wanted to love this oatmeal. Unfortunately, I felt like I was eating a bowl of cinnamon sugar. It was much too sweet and the cinnamon killed any and all other flavors. I haven't given up on steel cut oats, though. I'll definitively try them again but with MUCH less sugar and cinnamon.

Good but needs improvement.  At 5 hours on low mine was done.  Would add raisins last because they were plumped up like grapes and added that taste to the oatmeal.  I'm a cinnamon lover, but think the cinnamon could be decreased as well. I would also add more apples or add later in cooking, they were totally cooked down into the oatmeal and couldn't see them.  Worth trying again and playing with the ingredients.

This recipe is awesome.  Even my teenagers love it and normally they only like oatmeal in cookies.  The only change that I made is that I don't put the raisins in until after it's done.  I don't like raisins cooked so much.  So when my husband gets up, he turns it off and then when I go to reheat a bit in microwave, I toss in a few raisins.  This is just my preference.  Kids liked the raisins cooked.  I make a huge pot and it provides breakfast for several days.

This was pretty easy, healthy, and it was nice to wake up to a nice warm breakfast.

We didn't care for this one much. The first time it adhered to our crockpot. We doubled it the next time and cooked it on warm, but it was soup in the morning. So we set it to high and ate it a bit later. The raisins had reconstituted to grapes, there was way too much cinnamon and not enough sugar. I still really like the idea of oatmeal ready in the morning so I'll keep trying. But I'll definitely cut the cinnamon and omit the raisins.

I didn't care for this at all, but my son loved it.  It needed more sugar and there was too much cinnamon.  I will stick with my usual quick oat with brown sugar and raisins.

I expected this to be more tasty than it turned out to be.  The combination of apples and cinnamon and raisins had me eagerly anticipating this dish when I made it last week.  Maybe my disappointment was due to the fact that this was my first time using steel cut oats and it wasn't what I expected.  I just know I prefer my Quaker Quick-Cooking Oats with some Splenda mixed in to this recipe.

I make this for my husband because I don't always have time to make breakfast. He gets five or six mornings out out it because it is so filling! Bonus! I've made it once as it was written, except I didn't use raisins because my husband is allergic to grape products. I'm making it a second time with dates instead of apples because I haven't got any apples. It is so easy and tasty! Thanks, brandysue!

I followed the recipe to a T and I used steel cut oats, so that definitely wasn't where I went wrong. I cooked on low for 6 hours and the result was NOT an oatmeal concoction ANYONE ought to greet a loving spouse with in the morning! Either my taste buds vary vastly from the majority here, or something went horribly wrong because this was absolutely disgusting

Flavor was find, but didn't care for the texture of how it turned out.  I think I will look to some of the tweaking in other reviews and try this again sometime.

My family loved this recipe, and I loved coming down at 6 a.m. to find breakfast ready, especially on a school morning! I would cut the amount of cinnamon to 1-1/2 or 2 tsp.

Loved this recipe WITH THESE CHANGES: Add 3/4 t salt and cut cinnamon to 1 t instead of 1 T.

I also followed this recipe to the letter and found it disgusting.  It had WAY too much cinnamon, it was bitter.  If you are going to try it cut the cinnamon back to 1 tsp.  After spending 4.00 for steel cut oats I am going to try cooking them on the stove.

The consistency of this is odd and it always seems to burn along the edge of the slow cooker.

Great recipe - please make sure you use steel cut oats though.  Those reviewers who complain about the texture probably used regular oats (steel cut oats do NOT cook in five minutes).  Thanks brandysue!
