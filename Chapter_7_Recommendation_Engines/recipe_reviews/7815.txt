It was a hit! I made this cake as a two-layered round cake by upping the servings to 36. The cakes themselves did have to cook for about 30 min and I did add more milk, as suggested in other reviews. The cake was moist but not super light and tasted like caramel...mmmm. The icing made me a bit nervous as I'd never used a candy thermometer before...and I was concerned after reading other reviews that said it was thin. I used an electric mixer and beat it in the pot after it cooled (which took less than a minute after I removed it from the heat). I beat it for about 3 minutes and then let it rest. It thickened considerably but not to the point where I could use it on my cake so I beat it for another three minutes and let it rest for about 2 more and by then it had started to get the hardened looking top - that was my signal. I briefly beat it one more time (like, 10 sec) and then spread it over the bottom layer and then the sides and top. I put in fridge to set, though it hardly needed it. It was a super cake, just what I was hoping for. Be warned: it's ridiculously sweet! Start with small pieces!

This cake turned out great. So far the best cake recipe on this site. To the others who rated this cake and it didn't turn out good, you have to follow the directions to the tee on the icing. Invest in a candy thermometer,if not the icing will not turned out right. The heating and cooling process is a must with candied cooking. Co-workers, family and church members loved it made 4 cakes in one week. Experimented with the icing alot, just with how much I whipped it after it cooled down, you can make it fluffy or more like a candied traditional caramel icing, I prefered the candied, that's more like a traditional caramel icing. It's a sweet cake, but caramel cake is sweet.There's nothing light about it.

This cake was delicious!  However, because of what an earlier reviewer said, I increased the milk to about 3/4 cup and only cooked the cake for 20 minutes.  Also, the "icing" never got thick enough to spread, so I poked holes in the cake and poured it on top.  I topped it with macadamia nuts.

This is a great recipie, however it is not for the novice baker. I wish inexperienced cooks would not lower recipe ratings because of their ineptitude. If you the majority of the ratings are positive, isn't that a pretty good indication that perhaps you did something wrong?

This cake was delicious!  I made it for my Grandma's birthday and everyone really loved it!  The only thing I did differently was I used chocolate fudge frosting instead of the caramel frosting, and it turned out magnificent.  I also only baked the cake for 20 minuets and it was done.  I recommend trying out this recipe.  It was a wonderful change from a chocolate, vanilla, or yellow cake.  Next time I make it, I might try making a layered round cake.  The 9x13 size pan I used made a pretty thin cake and it was hard to get out of the pan without breaking.  But I have no complaints at all on the flavor!  I will definitely make this again.  In fact I already have some requests from the people who tasted it!

I divided this cake into two round cake pans and next time I would need to double the batch.  This cake is not as light and airy as I thought it would be.  My frosting was disasterous!  I followed the ingrediants and instructions to a tee and my frosting was extremely sugary.  I am hoping it was oprerator error, I really wanted this cake to be a success!

If it were up to me alone, I would give it only 2 stars.  I made this for a friends birthday, and although I didn't care for the cake at all, my friends seemed to like it.  Even with an extra half cup of milk, the cake was very dry.  By the third day, it was hard as a rock and unedible.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, but I don't think that I will be making this cake again.

the cake itself was too small and really needed to be doubled.  the caramel portion was hard.  it took on the "hard candy" form.

I hate to say it ...but I did find this cake to be a little on the dry side (and this was after I added a cup of mayonaise to the mix. Mayo is my secret weapon that usually gurantees a moist cake. Not in this case though.) It was also a bit salty. I am a novice cook so the fault could possibly be mine. Even so, I don't think I'll be making this particular cake again.

I was looking for a good caramel cake recipe and thought this was it. Caramel cakes are a southern favorite that date back from last quarter of the nineteenth century. I rated this recipe one star because it is not a easy recipe and it bland in flavor.  If you dont have time, skip this recipe. Second, I read in the reviews to increase the liquid because the cake turns out dry. I forgot to do this and YES!! it was as dry as a chicken bone. I really did not want a 9x13 cake so I doubled the recipe. hmmmmm.... When mixing the cake. The recipe says to use wisk beaters and mix for 2-3 minutes. My cake had tunnels and air pockets which can result from the batter being too thick or over mixing. I did use a wisk but I don't have one of those NICE mixers that mixes while it turns and has a 100 attachments so I mixed it by hand because I was afraid I would over mix it. Last but not least, the frosting. I noticed that many people could not get the frosting to thicken. My thickened, it was on its way to the caramel candy stage. I forgot to double my butter which I think made a difference. I had to add a lot of creme to get it to spread on the cake. Here is a a hint. My sister in law made a cake last year that would knock your socks off!! this is what she did: used a boxed cake mix, added lemon and almond flavoring and made her own caramel frosting and did not have to go through the trouble and time I went through making this. I still have not found a GOOD caramel cake recipe.

I followed the directions for this cake to the letter.  Was attempting to make a layer cake like the picture shown.  Hardly had enough batter to fill 2 8" pans.  Figured if the cake turned out, i would just make another batch.  Cake came out of the oven, first one came out of the pan great, second one crumbled into many, many pieces.  Tasted the crumbs and it was BLAND.    BTW, my pans were greased with Crisco and floured.  Very disappointed!

This recipe yields a very dry cake and somewhat salty (exact mesurements were used).   The directions says that a 9x13 pan should be used but the ingredients used does not create enough batter to make a 2-layer (2 inch deep) eight inch round cake.

I have only had the cake part of this recipe, and it was an instant hit. I found this recipe looking for a good base for a caramel cake, made with liquid caramel syrup poured on when it was warm. Since I also wanted a bit of a nutty taste, I added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to the batter. The cake is dense, and makes a very thin layer of cake, which is perfect for pouring on caramel.

I just made this cake and it is soooooooooo good! The cake is moist & has flavor. I increased the recipe to 36 servings to make a 2 layer 9 in. cake. The icing took some time & attention, but was well worth it. I wanted to eat it straight out of the pan=) I will be using this recipe again.

I didn't use this actual recipe but I was reading where some people states that the cake is dry.  The secret weapon for a dry cake is pudding from the box.  Depending on what flavor (chocolate cake you would use chocolate pudding in the batter and vanilla cake will use vanilla pudding).  Someone states that they used mayonnaise, I've never used such a thing.  Also, you can substitute butter and use Vegetable oil.

I baked this cake for my sister's birthday. With a few modifications as mentioned in previous reviews, it turned out moist and delicious. To prevent sticking, I greased AND floured the cake pans. I used 1-1/2 recipes or 36 servings and made three 8" layers, baking for 22 minutes. The caramel icing never quite got thick enough, even after cooling in the refrigerator for an hour, so I added some powdered sugar and it turned out perfect. Very delicious and would definitely make this again.

Recipe does not yield a normal size 2 layer cake. The batter is really thick and the cook time is less than 30 minutes. Tasted okay but not a good recipe to follow.

When I baked  this cake  I was worried that the cake might be dry as per other reviews so instead of just milk, i used buttermilk which really gave it good moisture. I had no problems with the caramel frosting. I beat it on my electric mixer for 9 mins until I got the right consistency.

This cake was delicious!  I helped my 13 year old son make this, it was the first cake he ever made.  It was easy and tasted great, nice and moist.  We used a smaller, 8 x 11.5 inch cake pan and it fit perfectly.  Next time, I will make 1 1/2 recipes so it will make a 9 x 13 cake.  We also used a different recipe for the frosting, Easy Caramel Frosting.

I agree with gdeezy. This rating is for the cake and the frosting. The frosting is delicious!  The cake was a little too dry.  It didn't have a lot of flavor.  I was able to get the frosting to a spreading consistency, and was able to do a two and a three layer cake.  It was time consuming, but if you are in the mood to bake and cook, it is a delicious frosting recipe.  I use it on a yellow cake mix.

First of all, the picture of the cake is deceiving because it looks nothing like that, especially if you're supposed to use a 9X13" pan as the recipe suggests! I totally agree with Lorna129 and JamS08, this was the worst cake that I ever made and wondered if this was a hoax recipe.  The cake was dry as a bone and rose to the height of a pan of jiffy cornbread and didn't even taste as good as jiffy. I was so disappointed that I cried because I had spent money on all of those ingredients. I should have known something was wrong with this recipe when it didn't call for any white sugar at all because it was blander than bland.  I didn't bother making the frosting and still have the heavy whipping cream in the fridge which I hope doesn't go to waste.  This recipe was a huge disappointment!

I made this cake as the recipe suggests, it made a 7in round two layer cake. So if you need more cake double the recipe. Other than that great cake! I will try it with cake flour next time instead of AP.

I followed the instructions to a T and none of it worked.  The cake stuck to the pan and the frosting is more sauce than frosting. It never got thick or creamy.  I can't believe anyone actually had success with this recipe.  I love baking and have never in my life had trouble like this

I was lookking for a healthier version of the traditional version.  I made this for my daughter's 2nd Birthday and my 5 children, husband and the guests LOVED it!  The frosting turned out just like caramel candy. The cake batter was very light, airy, and tasted really good!  Not sure what other reviewers did that didn't work but my kids ages 10, 6, 4, 2 & 1  (&husband) ask for this one quite often!

This rating is for the frosting only! It was delicious, however, I had a difficult time getting it to thicken even though I followed recipe to the "t" using a candy thermometer.  I beat it with electric mixer for several minutes... nothing happened. I finally refrigerated it, beat it again, refrigerated again, and beat it again on high for several minutes and got a consistency I could spread. Thank goodness I cooked my cake in a 9X13 pan instead of layers because the frosting never got stiff enough to frost cake sides. I sprinkled the pecans on the top. Also be prepared to wait at least an hour for the cake to cool to correct temperature.  All in all it is a very tasty frosting, just time consuming.

This cake wasn't near as good as I was hoping it would be.  The icing was the best part, although it was extremely sweet.  My children didn't seem to care.  Even though I followed the directions very carefully, my cake came out very dry.  I agree with others that there isn't that much batter here.  I poured my into a 9x13 pan and after baking it, my cake at it's highest was only 3/4 of inch high.  That's a very thin cake.  I won't try the cake recipe again, but I will use the icing recipe.

Ok, so the icing was the best, tho really rich.  I think in the future I will probably make up the caramel icing like the directions say, but instead of just beating it, I'll fold it into some whipped cream of already prepared butter cream frosting to lighten it up.  The cake wasn't bad, mine fell, so I'd reduce the amount of powder.  In the future though, to avoid the trouble, I think I'd rather use a boxed caramel cake.

This recipe's icing directions produced the best caramel cake my boyfriend and I had ever tasted-- even better than grandma's. I was lazy about the cake part and used a boxed mix to make four thin layers. The icing that this recipe makes is fab, though! You just have to be really patient with it and make sure you cook it to the right temperature and then cool it all the way down or else the icing will be too runny. It took me about an hour and a half for the entire heating to 240 F over medium heat / cooling down to 110 F process, but patience paid off big time. Thank you!

I did not find this recipe to be very delightful at all.  I followed the directions to a "T."  The cake did not rise and it was dry.  The icing never thickened enough to spread on the cake.

This cake turned out quite good. I wanted something different- not just a vanilla or chocolate cake. I did only bake it for 20 minutes and it turned out very moist. I also stuck in some chocolate chip. I didn't want to overdo it with the caramel so I used a chocolate frosting recipe from the website. I would make it again!

After reading the reviews, I also increased milk, and I upped the servings to make a thicker cake (in a 9x13).  I also baked at 325 and just watched it til it was ready.  I was so worried about it being dry, but by making these changes, this cake turned out EXTREMELY moist.  
Also, I used half vanilla extract and half almond extract in the cake batter because I love that almond flavor.  
I have never made anything with real caramel before, and I didn't realize how long the heating and cooling process actually takes!  I was worried that thermometer was never going to go from 220-238, but it did!   It is well worth the wait, because this cake is delicious!

This was 1 of the BEST recipes i've ever used for baking from scratch.  The cake itself was  good & I hadn't even frosted yet-i think thats because this recipe uses brown sugar-vs-white sgr. Altho the recipe calls for only vanilla extract, i use 1/2 pure almond & 1/2 vanilla-(good flavor combo).  I used Cake Flour, i think thats why it was so moist.  but, i shouldnt have sifted the flour becuz it is already presifted. I only use cake flour when i bake from scratch.  it was so moist, it fell apart when i tried to get it out of the dish. I wont sift it next time.  i had 2 start over, but used reg flour (i didnt hv enough cake flour left after the 1st try), which made the cake heavy & dry. baked it in a 9x13 glass dish, browned beautifully. it rose nicely w/the cake flour - was really flat & dense w/the regular flour.  i, too, followed the directions for the frosting to the "tee", but it never got thick.  I beat it for at least 5 min straight. so i drizzled it over the cake. i think i'll do what Paula "D" did w/her caramel frosting - add a little powered sugar to help thicken; well she added a lot, but thats 2 sweet 4 me.  its a wonderful caramel sauce. i'll continue to use it as sauce or poke holes in my cake & drizzle that way. i refrigerated the caramel sauce & warmed it to drizzle over my crumbled cake that fell apart.  it bounced bk to silkiness every time.  Also, i salvaged & froze my first cake that fell apart, it warms very well out of the freezer-warm on defrost

This is a great recipe. The frosting especially. I was a bit skeptical about the amount of milk and based on the reviews of some other cooks I started out using 3/4 cup. I whisked for a while and the batter was just to stiff and it was hard to get all the lumps out of the butter. I ended up adding 2 extra table spoons.

This is meant to be a dense, heavy cake and I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much on its own. I used it as part of a layer cake with the One bowl chocolate cake III recipe on this site and it was fantastic.

I used the caramel frosting as the fill. This frosting is fantastic but I don't think I would have enjoyed it covering an entire cake, personal taste. I used a chocolate frosting recipe from this site to frost the top and sides of the cake.

The finished result got excellent reviews!

This cake is absolutely delicious! of course I tweeked the caramel icing a bit, I used two cans of evaporated milk, 1 and half sticks of butter, and 1 cup of sugar, boil for 1 and half yo 2 hours constantly stirring on low to medium heat. Once the caramel is thick enough to coat the backbof a spoon, remove from heat and add 1 and half tablespoons of vanilla. Let sit for 45 minutes. This icing literally tastes like Werther's caramel Candie's!

It came out great. I'ts funny because I added more milk to the batter. Then went back & read the reviews and saw that I wasn't the only one to do so. The cake was moist, and the frosting turned out perfect. I recommend that you take your time when making the frosting. Then allow it to thicken as it cools. Definitely going to make this again!

This cake was very dry and did not have much flavor.  I increased the serving size to 36 and made a 3 layer.  I only used 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and it probably would have tasted better if I had increased to 2.  I used evaporated milk in the place of the heavy whipping cream and 1/2 pound of butter for the icing. The color was a little lighter than I wanted, but the icing was good.  My grandmother was a great baker and this was her specialty.  Her receipe for icing was different, as she used the candied version and whipped all the lumps out by hand.  I will try this again.

Cooked the cake for 20min like many suggested. It turned out wonderful and moist. Big hit!
