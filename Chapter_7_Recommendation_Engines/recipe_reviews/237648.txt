I made this recipe using what I had on-hand: kale, barley supplemented  by quinoa, lite coconut milk, black beans and sweet potatoes.  It was good and filling, if a little boring.  I will try the recipe again and experiment with spices that might enliven this healthy dish.

We've had this twice now. It's quite tasty but it does need more spice - I double the cajun seasoning and add generous salt and pepper.  The serving size is REALLY off though.  This would easily feed 4 or 5 adults as a main course. I'm not sure who could eat this in 2 servings!

Quite tasty and great choice for vegans.  The recipe actually makes enough food for four healthy servings.  With that in mind, the nutritional values would be cut in half -- roughly 500 calories per serving and what one expects for a meal.

The proportions for barley are off (add 1/2 c barley for 1 1/14 c water or double both) and it is really bland.  Add seasonings.  In the future I will just make my own recipe for kale and for black beans and do this presentation.

Reasonably good as a conceptual recipe but bland. I used a lot more Cajun spice on the sweet potatoes, and the black beans I used were homemade and nicely flavored. I also added lime, cilantro, and onion; even so, it needed more. I did use brown rice instead of barley, and I steamed the kale.  Proportions seemed a bit off but that's easily fixable.

LOVE IT! The only change I made was steaming the Kale 2-3 mins over the barley.
A staple now - thank you Seattle Dad

This was delicious! I didn't have the barley, so I substituted millet and I can't take the heat of cajun seasoning,  so I used Nature's Seasons. I also did the chopped kale, black beans, coconut milk, olive oil, salt & pepper in the same sauce pan with a crushed garlic clove to save time. This is a quick, easy, versatile dish that makes for a pretty presentation and a flavor that even non-vegetarians will love.

Overall the dish was good, but kind of plain. There were way too many potatoes for me, so next time I will use 2 potatoes instead of 3, and twice the barley. The beans and kale need more zing so I will put in some additional spices. It definitely has potential!

Excellent dish for a vegetarian change of pace.  Tasted healthy but with lots of flavor.  I'd like it better as a side dish instead of a main dish though.

This recipe definitely makes enough for 4 people. I did salt and pepper the kale as it cooked. I also added hot sauce to mine....perfect!

A great way to get a full days salt and carbs in one simple meal. Otherwise, meeting half a days calories w/ one meal is quite efficient.
