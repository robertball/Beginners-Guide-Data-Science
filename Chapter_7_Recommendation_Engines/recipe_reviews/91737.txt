Very good, very easy!  I used crunchy peanut butter  instead of adding nuts, and I didn't have white chocolate, so I used a bag of Toll House chocolate chips - so, its chocolate peanut butter fudge - deelish!  this recipe's a keeper!

This is the best PB fudge recipe I have tried so far.  I left out the nuts and just used creamy PB.  This gave it a delicate PB flavor w/out being too over powering.:)

This fudge recipe is great.  I also substituted white chocolate chips and they melted very well into the fudge mixture.  It's so easy and you don't have to mess with a candy thermometer.

I had trouble making the other fudge recipes without burning them.  This was sooo easy and so good.  To make it even easier, I'd use white chocolate chips so you don't have to cut up the squares.

This is a great recipe, fast and fool proof. I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding the chopped peanuts, and used a 12 oz package of white chocolate chips, smooth creamy with lots of peanut flavor easy enough to make several batches for gift giving they'll think you worked a lot harder than you did.

At first, I thought there wouldn't be nearly 64 servings, but since it is so rich, it is definately 64. Very good and everyone loved it--super easy.

This is amazing fudge! So easy to make and tasted wonderful, and not sickly sweet like a lot of regular chocolate fudge. Like other reviewers, I used crunchy PB and omitted the chopped peanuts.

I am not a fan of the jaw puckering, hard as a brick regular peanut butter fudge so this suited me perfectly! It's sweetness & texture is just right for me! Where it called for white chocolate bars, I instead used white chocolate chips & also some peanut butter chips & stirred them just till they barely started to melt as I wanted some texture. I omitted the peanuts simply because I prefer it that way. It would be even simpler to melt the Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk with the peanut butter in the microwave while stopping to stir occasionally till blended & pretty warm & then add in the vanilla, white chocolate chips (or chopped bars) 
to finish. That way you don't have to worry about constantly stirring a pot so the bottom doesn't scorch!

The fudge was very good. The flavor was very and peanutty. I liked the fudge wasn't too sweet I thought it would be. I guess the texture of my fudge was a little wrong, I don't know where was my mistake, but I seemed my fudge didn't set up and was a little sticky. Maybe next time I will heat the mixture longer. But who cares for the texture, it was so delicious.

I did not care for this recipe. The taste was fine, but the texture was too smooth and the fudge never hardened. It got to a "firm ball" stage of candy. It is basically like candied peanut butter, not fudge. I would only use this again to make a peanut butter swirl for ice cream or filling in a cake.

Quick, easy and delicous, made with ingredients on hand.  How perfect is that?  Made with chunky peanut butter (didn't measure, between 1/2 and 1 cup) and chocolate chips instead of white chocolate.  Next time I'll pour into a 9x4 loaf pan for a thicker final product.

This turned out to be a beautiful fudge. I was worried at first when I read some the reviews saying they tasted the white chocolate too much so I cut the servings of this recipe down just to test it and let me say, this recipe is great I wish I made more. That said, I did get a slight hint of white chocolate aftertaste but the peanut butter was totally prominent otherwise. The fudge was obviously very creamy and perfectly sweet. I left out the chopped nuts per personal preference. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for posting.

For simplicity and texture, this really does deserve 5 stars. No candy thermometer or cold water testing necessary, and super-smoooooothe. Yum! But I only gave it a 4 stars (I wish I could have given it 4 and a half) because it wasn't quite "peanutbuttery" enough. The white chocolate really is the predominant flavor here. It really would be more accurately called White Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge. But very yummy and I'll certainly be making it again. One friend we gave some to said they reminded her of a Payday candybar.

Candy recipes always intimidated me with the candy thermometer and all, but this recipe is so simple you can't screw it up. I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out perfect! Don't bypass the chopped peanuts by using crunchy peanut butter, it's not the same. Not for the calorie conscious! 5 stars and highly recommended

This is delicious! I actually made this for my hubby to take to work, but the smell of it while it was cooling was so good that I had to try a small piece. It has a wonderful creaminess to it that I really loved and it definately gets points for ease! After I poured the mixture into the pan I immediately pressed more crushed peanuts on top (instead of waiting) and once it cooled they stayed on perfectly. This is a great and easy recipe that I know I will use often! :)

Fool proof and awesome, you won't be disappointed if you make this. No changes needed, just make sure you use REAL white chocolate with some cocoa butter content, not that white candy coating stuff.

i made this recipe a little lighter and it turned out awesome.  i used reduced fat crunchy peanut butter and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  no one knew the difference until i told them and then they got another piece!!!  i will definitely be making this quick, easy recipe again!

This is the easiest recipe yet!  My husband warned me not to be too excited about making fudge, that is usually doesn't turn out right the first or second time.  But while I was cutting up the final product, he said he was wrong, it was the best fudge he has ever had.  Thank you for this simple and tastly recipe!

Easy to make with a rich taste. I made three batches for school and work. Took about an hour and yielded plenty for both, plus some for home. Excellent texture and taste. A great recipe for a child to help you with. I skipped the chopped peanuts. Wonderful.

Excellent!  Super creamy and very easy!  I poured mine in a silicone baking dish the set up.  It made it extremely easy to get the fudge out when I was ready to cut it.  This was my first time to make PB fudge and it was a success!

I was trying to 'use up' the last of the Christmas staples.  So I used a bag of peanutbutter /semi-sweet choc. chips.  I had a 1/4  cup of crunchy peanutbutter left, used that and finished with creamy. I put in large microwave safe bowl, the Eagle Brand, chips and peanutbutter/choc. chips and cooked on high for  2:22 (I have a 1250 watt).  Took it out, stirred and added 1 7 oz. jar Marshmallow creme, a big handful of toasted pecans and 1 tsp. vanilla.  These were really creamy and good but I prefer more peanutbutter taste.  Will try again the way it is written.

So creamy and good, and so easy! I use white chocolate chips (12 oz.) and I grind peanuts really fine and sometimes I omit the peanuts.

Yum! I doubled this and used three bags of white chocolate chips! I also just sprinkled a couple handfuls of peanuts. This was my favorite out of all of the fudge I made this Christmas!

I had tried at least four other fudge recipes that either did not set up right or way too sweet and was about to give up until somebody told me about this recipe.  It is SO delish!  I used more peanut butter than the recipe called for like 3/4- 1 cup.  It is NOT overly sweet like the last recipe that I tried.  I cannot even taste the white chocolate and it so much easier (and less messy) than using a recipe with powdered sugar plus I used a microwave-safe bowl and just microwaved the white choc chips, sweetened condensed milk and PB, then even stirred in an extra teaspoon of PB after taking it out of the microwave.  Husband loves this recipe and I am giving these out to friends and family who are sure to enjoy during the holidays!

EXCELLENT!  I was looking for another flavor fudge to add to my homemade gifts.   I used white chocolate morsels in place of squares or bars.  They melted so easily.   I omitted the peanuts due to a diet restriction.  This flavor fudge was a first for me and I found it truly peanutty!  Thank you EAGLE BRAND® for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is easy and can be changed just as easily.  Instead of peanuts, I used crunchy peanut butter.  Also, I didn't have white chocolate and everyone loves regular chocolate, so I substituted regular chocolate squares.  It came out amazing!  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

Totally delish, super rich and extremely easy to make.  After following another reviewer's idea, I substituted 1- 12 oz. bag of white choc. chips in place of the candy bark.  Made things even easier. Will definitely make this one again for the holidays!

I'll give it 5 stars, though I don't really know how they taste.  Every last piece was gone before I had a chance to sample it!  Compliments were plenty, so I think it's safe to add this to my permanent recipe box!

This was relatively easy to make and a nice alternative to the typical chocolate fudge. The recipe as is makes a good peanut butter fudge no changes are needed- and if you eat when its still kinda warm it takes like a melted peanut butter cookie! yum =)

I used 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup creamy plus peanuts.  Added a pinch of salt.  This tasted a bit like a Snickers bar minus the chocolate.  Rave reviews at home!

This recipe is divine! So simple to make and so tasty! It is very creamy. I made two batches...one with chopped peanuts (that I chopped and roasted first), and one without peanuts. I did change one thing...I used a natural peanut butter called, "Naturally More". You can find with all the other peanut butters at the grocery store but it tastes so much better and has natural ingredients. It does have to kept in the refridgerator. I made 7 different varieties of fudge to sell for charity and this one is my favorite!

Got kind of hard to stir for a while, but when all was said and done it came out pretty good.  Not quite the recipe I was looking for - it does have that "quick fudge recipe" taste, but not the "old-fashioned, homemade" flavor.  Still good though - I used over chocolate fudge to make double-decker.  Cut into big huge chunks, wrapped in plastic wrap and tied with ribbon and sold at a bake sale.

I made this using Reese's peanut butter chips instead of the white chocolate. The fudge is very tasty at room temperature; but is not as pleasing when eaten chilled.

I couldn't find actual white chocolate so I used the white baking chips instead. Although the recipe was easy to make it had way too much vanilla flavor and less peanut and left an aftertaste. My advice: find actual white chocolate and don't sub with the "white baking chips".

Turned out delicious! I combined the peanut butter & condensed milk in a microwavable bowl, then microwaved for two minutes before stirring in 10 ounces (one bag) of Reese's chips & 2 ounces of white chocolate chips until smooth. Quickly stirred in vanilla, poured into my prepared dish, & put it in the refrigerator to set. Easy, fast, yummy, and deliciously peanut buttery from subbing the Reese's chips! Will definitely make again!

Though I've been making fudge for years, this was my first attempt at peanut butter fudge. Had a can of Eagle Brand milk on hand, so this recipe was handiest for me. I used Natural Creamy JIF peanut butter and left out the chopped peanuts (is to be a gift, so leaning on the safe side). I also had a 12oz. bag of white chocolate chips, so used those instead of bark.

Wow! Talk about the fastest fudge in town!! Was done in no time, set up beautifully and tasted fantastic - very smooth, not gritty or grainy at all.  Had no trouble with consistency when removing from the pan - was firm, not too soft at all, and lifted perfectly from the pan (I used a glass baking dish greased with real butter). Will definitely be my go-to recipe for peanut butter fudge!!

Made exactly like recipe minus the chopped peanuts. I loved that I didn't have to get out the candy thermometer. I made it to add to cookie tins for Christmas presents, I predict a big hit!!

I used peanut butter flavored Candy Melts instead of the white chocolate chips.
Everyone loved it.

This was delicious. Based on my husband's preferences, I doubled the peanut butter and white chocolate (so we'd have a bigger batch as well) and omitted the nuts. It solidized perfectly in about two hours. Now to make it last longer than that!

I made this using white chocolate chips. Easy and it tastes great. I did attempt to make it in the microwave, but it was very grainy. Make sure to  make it on the stove top...it is quick and foolproof.

Okay. How bad could it be with peanut butter white chocolate. Very easy to make. I left the peanuts out to maintain a creamier consistency. May try it with more peanut butter to make it melt in your mouth more easily.

For now I will give this 3 stars. The flavor is really good, not overpowering like some peanut butter things can be. However, it never firmed up like proper fudge. I will make it again in the future to see if I did something incorrectly and adjust my rating accordingly.

Excellent!!  I cannot BELIEVE how easy this is to make!!  My husband needed something to take to work the next day and I was informed about this at 1:00 a.m.!!  I didn't use peanuts because I didnt have them, but everything else I had in the house and this was so simple and delicious!!  You must constantly stir though, your arm will get quit a work out, but its so worth it!!  Thank you!!

Delicious! Very smooth and creamy but most importantly... EASY! I'm not a very good candy maker, so I like recipes like this one that taste like fudge with having to use the thermometer. I used crunchy peanut butter to add a little extra crunch.

This is so good and so easy.  There's no reason why anyone cannot make this!  Try it, you'll like it!  I just read some of the other reviews and saw a very negative one--I think it must be the brand of peanut butter used.  Fudge is only as good as the ingredients you use.  I like "Adams" 100% natural peanut butter.  Give it a try.

I thought this was ok, it served the purpose everyone ate some. Maybe I'm not as big of a peanut butter fan as I thought I was. I probably would not make this again.

Won't be making this one again! This really surprised me since it got so many great reviews, but this tasted TERRIBLE! I would hardly call this Peanut Butter fudge--more like White Chocolate fudge. If you are really a fan of peanut butter, I would urge you to stay away from this one!Sorry :(

I've never made or had fudge before...crazy, right? No idea what I should expect, so I followed the recipe exactly except for using a 12 oz bag of white chocolate chips, and crunchy, all natural peanut butter, which was all I had. I also used a generic brand of condensed milk...and I'm ashamed to admit it, imitation vanilla extract. Oh, the horror, right?;] Well, it still turned out FABULOUS! I was dreading that it would turn out like the hard milk toffees of my youth, which I hated, but these are smooth...and creamy! The pb flavor comes out after refrigeration. So much simpler than the cookies I usually make for xmas. Can't wait to make different types of fudge. I'm taking them to a party tomorrow so let's see how it does:)

Very Easy and delicious. I cook this every year as part of my Christmas Cookie tray.
