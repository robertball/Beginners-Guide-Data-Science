This was super tasty! I changed it a bit, out of necessity. Firstly, I couldn't find apple cranberry chutney, so I used mango. Secondly, I accidentally bought chive cream cheese, but used it anyways. Who doesn't love a little salty-sweet combo?! Very awesome.

This is a great recipe.  The chutney and the curry meld well together and the cream cheese adds a nice mellowing agent.  I didn't need the entire chicken - I had about 2 cups left over.  This ages well and we thought it tasted even better the next day.   We also thought it was missing something crunchy, maybe a little celery or some water chestnuts would give what we're looking for and a little bit of salt would also add a nice balance to the sweetness of the chutney.  The second day, we sprinkled some toasted almond slices on top and that really added a nice crunch and a nice extra flavor.  Thanks for this recipe.  I never would have come up with this on my own.  Yummy!

Interesting, I've been looking for a way to use some Home canned Apple Chutney so I tried this. First I cut the recipe to fit my needs using 1/2 cup chicken, 3 Tablespoons Apple Chutney, 1 Tablespoon Dried Cranberries, 1 Tablespoon Cream Cheese, and 1/2 Teaspoon Curry Powder. I also put it on a Good multi grain bread. All in all came out good, next time I'll toast the bread and cut in half, maybe add a little more Curry Powder

I couldn't find cranberry apple chutney so I just used the cranberry chutney.  Next time I think I'll finely chopped up some apples and that will make it crunchy!
