Very good. I used half mayo and half sour cream bc I'm not a huge mayo fan and I just wanted to mellow the flavor of the mayo. I also think that 1 lb of cheddar is way too much cheese but maybe that's just me. I only used a bag of cheese that I have and it's about 6 oz. Worked perfectly fine for me. I was a bit impatient and tried it with multigrain tortilla chips then made a wrap with tortilla and ham before refrigerating it. The verdict: both bf and I like it a lot. We'll eat the rest of it after it's been refrigerating for a while. Thanks for the recipe!

I added more mayonnaise to give it a more spreadable texture. I also think the cheddar/feta ratio needs adjusting to allow this recipe to enjoy the little kick that feta can provide.
