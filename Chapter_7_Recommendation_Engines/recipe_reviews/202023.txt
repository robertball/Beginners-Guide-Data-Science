I have looked for a cucumber salad that we really liked and now I have found it! The flavors all go together perfectly. What a great summer salad. I followed the recipe exactly and it is super as is. Thank you, Cheryl!

This is a great summer salad.  It's perfect for using up those cucumbers you always seem to have too many of, if you've got a garden.  The ginger might sound weird, but gives the salad a really unique and delicious taste!

Definately not your typical cucumber salad!  I love the zip of the jalepenos, but found out I'm not that fond of ginger (that's just my personal taste).  I kind of missed that strong vinegar usually associated with cuke salads, so next time I'll use plain old white distilled vinegar.  Oh- and LOVE the carrots.. overall this dish is yummo!

Mine came out very watery. Maybe I didn't drain enough, I even blotted them with paper towels lol  I don't think I would marinade cucumbers in water and salt again.  The taste was ordinary, I don't think I'll make it again, I'm glad I tried it though.

I loved this. I have made it twice this week to use all my cucumbers. It is like the "goumet" version of the cuke salad my grandmother made when I was a kid. I love the ginger and the kick of the jalepenos. I used stevia instead of sugar and can't tell there's no sugar.

This was a great twist on the traditional Cucumber Salad.  The jalapeno added the perfect amount of heat to the salad, and I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good recipe but I thought the ginger was a little too predominate for my taste. Enjoyed it though. Next time I'll use less ginger. Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful refreshing summer salad. I used fresh ginger and red onion and a bit more carrots. I skipped the pre-marinating process, just mixed it all up and let it marry about two hours in the fridge. This is one of those recipes you have had in your box forever and when you finally come around to making it, wonder what took you so long. I'll surely make this simple salad often. Thanks Cheryl.

This was pretty good but next time I will cut the amounts of sugar and ginger in half, they were too overpowering for us.

This was a great recipe.  I was a little intimidated with the jalape√±o so I used an anaheim pepper, but my husband who hates cucumbers loved this because of all the flavors that it has.   Next time I am going to sear some tuna and serve this as the side.

Nice change for the use of cucumbers. Family liked it. It got better the following day. I used fresh ginger, and it just went so well in the dressing. It was quite pretty to with all the colors. Appealing to the eye!

I am a huge cucumber salad fan.  I'm also a big ginger fan.  Never thought to mix the 2.  This is a very good cold salad to serve as a side for soup and/or sandwiches.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I am rating it 4 stars ONLY because I have tasted cucumber salads that I liked more. This one is definitely worth a try.  Different, but very good! I do think it's a keeper.

I made this for my boyfriend because he begged me to make a cucumber salad of some sort.  It looked like a beautiful recipe so I tried it.  I didn't use the rice vinegar because we couldn't find it at the store and I like the tangy vinegar taste in cucumber salads.  It was a good recipe, however I think next time I'll let it marinate in the fridge a little longer (maybe over night).  My boyfriend took it up to college with him and said that it tasted even better as it sat longer in the fridge. But he sure loved it, that's for sure!

I made this as per the recipe except using pickled jalapenos since that's all I had. We thought it was great! I love the ginger/rice vinegar combo. This is a perfect side dish in the summertime when you don't want to turn on the stove! The next time I made it, I used two packages of Splenda rather than sugar and added more vinegar since we do really like a "zippy" salad and it was even more suited to our taste buds :o) I grew up eating cucumbers in vinegar with salt and pepper and I still love that, but this is a nice variation when we have a large crop of cucumbers in the summer! Thanks again!

This was very good with the cucumbers, sweet onions, and carrots.  I enjoyed the extra kick of the jalapenos, but my family did not like it at all with them.  Also, be sure to mix the vinegar with the seasonings before adding them to the vegetables.

This is one of our favorite cucumber recipes. It's easy and we always have the ingredients on hand. We typically do not add the ginger, but it was a nice change. It's a nice addition to spring rolls, noodle bowls or sushi.

Easy to make, colorful, and a little bit different.  I don't like vinegar, so I made substituted 1/8 of a cup of lemon juice for vinegar, and I think it's fine.

This was so good.  I always make the same old cucumber salad and this was an awesome change!  The nutmeg scared me but it was such an interesting twist that really complimented the flavors.  Love it!
