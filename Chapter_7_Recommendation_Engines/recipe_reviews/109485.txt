This is the first time I've ever given a one star rating to a recipe, but there was nothing else I could do. I made these dumplings exactly as written, even though it seemed to be a bit excessive in the baking powder...I was correct about that! The dough seemed fine, and so I proceeded to add them to my turkey soup. Once in the pot, however, they fell apart completely, making a thick, unappetizing, and chunky soup. The fragments weren't dumpling -like at all...they were soggy and mushy. My family was extremely disappointed and so was I. Sorry, but I won't be making these again!

I use this recipe nearly every time I make a roast.  Just drop by tblsps on top of your gravy and let them simmer for 5 min then turn over for another 5 min.  You can cover them if you like!  These are not soup dumplings so do not expect them to be real solid.  They are a light and fluffy dumpling that taste wonderful with gravy! Thank you for posting this recipe Gina, as I used to have the exact same one years ago and had lost it!

Very disappointing. They came out soggy and mushy, not the slightest bit fluffy. I won't use this recipe ever again.
