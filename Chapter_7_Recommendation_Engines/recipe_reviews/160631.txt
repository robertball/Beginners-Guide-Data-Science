This soup has a lot of potential, and I love that it doesn't use dairy. However, we thought the orange zest was way out of place. I used less than called for, and still it was the dominant flavor. I'm also not sure the honey is necessary. I made this with almond milk, and it was thick and creamy. I also used fresh corn, and subbed freshly roasted Hatch green chiles for the jalapeno, which gave it more heat (I don't think it'd be very spicy with just the half jalapeno). If I were to make this again, I'd roast the bell peppers for more flavor, add more oregano, omit the orange zest, and add a bit of cumin.

I made this as written, although I cut the recipe in half.  Unfortunately, it didn't work for us.  The honey, orange, soy sauce just seem out of place considering the rest of the ingredients.  I wish I had heeded my instinct to omit them, because I tasted before I added them and thought the flavor was ok.

We loved this!!!  It had the perfect spicy/sweet to it!  It's a little sweeter than most corn chowders but I think it helps to cut down on some of the heat.  I used fat free milk instead of soy, since we don't like it and used vegie stock in place of the wine.  The orange zest did not bother me at all.  My husband took some leftovers to work last night and said they were even better that way!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe and have a few suggestions to make it great!  This recipe doesn't have very much character ... just a lot of heat.  Heat/spice should really be the last and most memorable of the food as the individual experiences the taste, character and hopefully the complexity of a thoughtfully layered dish.

So here is what I did ... 

I added heavy whipping cream to get the consistency of a chowder.  This recipe uses cornstarch to thicken it and since it calls out for soy milk and not even a true cream you will need a lot more cornstarch than 3 tbs.  So after using way more than 3 tbs I added dried potatoes ... a little at a time adding more to reach your preferred taste and texture of course.  I also added actual potatoes and celery to this recipe to add to the "layering" of the chowder.  

Lastly, to give it the real depth and character of an amazing chowder I added chopped clams and the clam juice.  AMAZING!!!!!!!
