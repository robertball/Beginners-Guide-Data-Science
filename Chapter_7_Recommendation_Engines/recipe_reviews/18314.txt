I used a half-pound of sausage and it went over well.  Nice change from the 'standard' green bean casserole.

I, TOO, ONLY USED 1/2LB JIMMY DEAN SAUSAGE (OUR FAVORITE). I LIKE CRM OF CELERY SOUP, SPRINKLE OF LEMON JUICE TO BRIGHTEN THIS UP. USED 1/2 THE SOUR CREAM AND ADDED SMALL AMT OF CHEDDAR TOPPING.  THIS WAS GOOD AND CAN BE SO VERSATILE. I'M NOT MUCH OF A "PLAIN GREEEN BEAN" EATER CAUSE THEY'RE SO BORING. BE SURE TO RINSE THE CANNED BEANS TO GET RID OF THAT METALLIC TASTE.

The creaminess of the beans is really nice, but the sausage adds too much to it.  I don't really think that the spices go with this dish too well.  If I make this recipe again, I'll use half of the recommended sausage.

I used cream of chicken soup, 1 lb. sliced turkey sausage, and 16 oz. frozen, thawed green beans.  It worked well.

I've used this recipe for several years now. It's great for potlucks-I alost always bring home an empty dish.
