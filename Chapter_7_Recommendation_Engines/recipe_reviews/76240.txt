Garlic makes the world a better place so I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic with the onions. I was very hesitant to add a sugar substitute, but it really worked! I used fresh herbs (basil, rosemary, sage and thyme) instead of the italian seasong mix. Hubby thought it was a bit bland, but my children and I really liked it. I think next time I'll just use whole chicken breast baked with a blend of italian seasonings and make the sauce as outlined in the recipe. Over a good dish, and I'll make it again.

I added some minced garlic and parmesan to this recipe, and my family absolutely loved it. I let it simmer for about 3 hours, so the flavors would blend well. The chicken was sooo moist and tender! The sauce seemed a bit runny, and bland. I think next time I will make it with spaghetti sauce instead and maybe add some mushrooms. Overall, everyone loved it and ate all the leftovers!

I gave this recipe four stars after I changed some things. To be fair, though, I changed this recipe before I made it the first time. I increased the chicken to 2&1/4lbs and used skinless, boneless thighs. Then increased the onions and peppers to 2/3c each. I eliminated the tomato sauce and added 1(28oz)can of crushed tomatoes instead. I also added 1&1/2tsp of minced garlic and 1/2c sliced fresh mushrooms. I increased the Italian seasoning to 2tsp and the black pepper to 1/4tsp. I left out the olives only because I do not like them. I would make this again only I would decrease the sugar to only 1tbsp. I added both and I thought it was too sweet.

I really liked this recipe, like most recipes when it comes to the seasonings I don't measure them.  To keep the chicken from being bland, I sprinkled on some minced garlic while sauteing the peppers and onions.  I also added the italian seasoning before the tomatoes.  I used 2 14.5 ounce diced tomato cans and more tomato sauce, I love tomatoes.  I also only added half the splenda called for.  This was wonderful served over whole wheat rotini pasta.

My family said this was too bland, it just tasted like plain tomatoes and chicken. It needed more spice, or.....something.

My husband and I love this recipe... you'd be amazed how just a little bit of sugar takes this recipe from good to great. Love it!

This was very easy to make and pretty good. My husband liked it, but even better, my 3-year-old, who doesn't usually like tomato sauces, liked it. The Splenda sweetened it up a bit and blended well with the italian spices. I will make this again.

whole family loved this recipe.  so much so that i printed it for my recipe box.  i did cheat though .. instead of chicken breast halves i bought chicken tenders, which made for a lot less cutting.

I started with frozen chicken breasts cut in cubes, I added 2 cloves diced garlic, 2 TBS. of olive oil and a can of drained mushrooms,seasoned with black pepper to taste. This was one of the easiest dishes to prepare on a night when I didn't have time to cook. I served it over linguini with  a side salad and garlic bread. I will do it again soon.

This was a very easy meal to prepare. However, it was a little bland, so I think the next time I'll try adding some fresh oregano and garlic to it to spice things up!

I thought the flavors all blended well for a great, healthy dinner.  My main complaint is that it's a little on the sweeter side... I would only use 3/4ths of the Splenda called for.

This recipe was something I made for a crowd, so it worked well to match everyone's tastes. I added 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms which made it a hit. I only added half the splenda and next time I will add even less, I never used splenda before and it was way too sweet for us! The sweet sauce was a good change, though. When I make it again, I will only use about 1/3 of the splenda called for in the original recipe.
