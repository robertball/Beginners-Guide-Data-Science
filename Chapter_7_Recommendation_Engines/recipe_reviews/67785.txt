Simply Fantasic! I used the mini pita's instead so that there were little individual pizzas. I blended all the ingredients together in the food processor including 3/4 of the cheese. I then spooned the mixture onto each mini pita and topped with some extra goat cheese. I also added about 2 Tablespoons of pesto to the mix. Everyone really loved it and I just kept popping them in my mouth!! I will definetly make these again.

This is a truly versitile recipe...it is easy enough for casual or last minute get togethers yet it will hold its own at more formal events.  I recommend reducing a good balsamic vinegar by about 2/3 and then drizzling it on top of pizzas...it adds depth to the flavor!

The flavors were fantastic. I was unsure about the balsamic. So I ate some without it. But once I tried it I added it to the rest of them. Also, I grilled some chicken on the George Forman diced it and added it to the mixture. I also added some spinach. Giving the recipe protien and green.

Delicious and gorgeous. I actually used a thin pizza crust and made a large pizza instead of individuals. Also put chopped black olives on one side.

This is easy and actually quite elegant.  I used goat cheese that was already in crumbles that I purchased at the grocery store.  I also used mini pitas instead of regular size pitas, and I cut them in half when they came out of the oven.  As a reviewer suggested, I made a balsamic vinegar reduction to drizzle over the pizzas after I sprinkled them with fresh torn basil leaves.  My guests all loved this recipe.  It was really quite easy and impressive.

These were amazing!  I made them with 5 flat breads (not split) and used the same toppings and loved it.  Took them to a party and they disapeared almost immediately.

I've made these a few times so far and here is what I've learned.  If desired, you can prep for this dish the night before by doing your chopping and then just putting the peppers & tomatoes right back into their jars (with their original liquid).  Look for crumbled goat cheese.  The one I used is made by Saladena and includes thyme, basil, and red sweet pepper - perfect for this dish!).  Do NOT throw all the ingredients together in a food processor as another reviewer suggested.  It should look like the recipe photo when you're done and not a paste/spread.  If you can find them at your store - look for Vlasic Roasted Sweet Red Pepper strips and Orchard Valley Harvest Sun Dried California Tomatoes (Julienne cut in oil).  These are both already somewhat pre-cut for you so half of the chopping is already done. The peppers & tomatoes I was able to get at Super Walmart, the cheese was found at Albertson's/Jewel. This is a FABulous appetizer and makes such a beautiful presentation!  It is so nice to pair with some red wine - particularily if you're serving an Italian themed meal (but certainly tasty even if you're not). I will definitely plan on keep this recipe on my appetizer rotation for a long time to come.

Really terrific -- impressive and delicious! I used mini-pitas (whole) to make hors d'oeuvres, and served the balsamic on the side. I used pre-sliced roasted red pepper and sundried tomatoes, so I could just snip the slices with kitchen scissors to get a small-dice with no mess. Used arugula as I didn't have basil (I think both are good matches), and added bits of salami for the meat-eaters.           

To crumble the goat cheese, make sure it's nice and chilled (a few hours in the fridge, or 30 mins in the freezer should do). Put it in a bowl, and just grab two forks and start poking at the cheese with the tines. It'll crumble nicely... if it starts to get mushy, pop it back in the fridge to chill.

Was pretty good.  You have to like goat cheese though.  I had some problems "crumbling" the goat cheese, but other then that pretty easy to make.  I would make again.

Yum.  Incredibly easy and quick, too!  I sliced the toppings, which bf complained about, but oh well.  I made this as a main dish so just made 2 pita pizzas, one for each of us.  I think this is a great combo of flavors, and it looks good too.  I didn't halve the pita but it was still nice and crisp.  thanks for the recipe!

I added fresh tomatoes and artichoke hearts cut in quarters.  Fresh, healthy, and fast!  Took me only 25 mins including prep time.

These were wonderful!!  I was hoping for leftovers so we could have more for ourselves but they disappeared quickly at our party.  The only downside is that this is quite an expensive dish.

This was really good! I did make some minor changes - I used whole wheat pita, HERBED goat cheese, i didn't have any sun dried tomatoes so I used artichoke hearts instead. Very simple and yummy!

I thought this recipe was pretty darn good. My husband was not a huge fan for some reason, maybe because there was not meat. I made it for our main dish one night and I loved it. I put on mushrooms, onions and tomatoes and left off the roasted peppers. Yum!

Loved these pizzas.  The mixture of flavors was wonderful.  I didn't have pita bread so I used flour tortillas.  Wasn't crazy about that part, but I will experiment with different "crusts".

This pizza looked and tasted fantastic!  Very gourmet flavor and appearance yet so easy to prepare.  The only change I made was by using refrigerated pizza dough instead of the pitas.  Great appetizer or main dish.

Really good. I scaled the recipe and made only two pizzas (one whole pita). I also added some canned, sliced mushrooms. I tried it both with and without the balsamic vinegar... I liked it better with.

Superb! Everyone loved these and they were gone in no time. I used fresh peppers (red, yellow and orange) and roasted them myself on the BBQ, and added caramelized onions. It made for a very pretty colour mixture and delicious flavour.

This is really good. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. The second time I made it I used a flour tortilla as a pizza crust and added feta and parmesan regianno cheese and made a mixture with all the ingredients except the spinach and after laying the spinach leaves down I just spread the mixture on the pizza's and broiled them in the oven. They were great too!

I may never go back to mozzarella cheese again on my homemade pizza!  Costco sells the most fabulous rosemary-encrusted goat cheese that is actually hard enough to be sliced with a cheese slicer.  Some fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, garlic, and the rosemary-goat cheese and viola!  The most delicious pizza you have ever had!  Who would have thought goat cheese on a pizza?  Great recipe, SmithClan!

This was delicious and colourful! I will be making this again for sure! The kids weren't a fan of it though. Too much bold flavour for them I think. Only thing I changed, was that I added Capers too. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was delicious!  I originally made it with basil and another time when I didn't have any on hand, I tossed some field greens in the balsamic vinegar and topped the pizza with that.  Both were great!  Will be making these again.

This was my first time using goat cheese, so I don't know if it was me or the recipe but this just did not turn out how I had hoped.  The cheese dried out instead of staying creamy or melting.
