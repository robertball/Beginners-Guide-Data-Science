YUMMO!!

(As Rachael would say!!)  The only thing I changed was the mayo before the bread crym mixture......the mayo didn't appeal to me (seemed too thick and gloppy) so i made a mix of half mayo and half milk whisked together.  I dipped the chicken into that first and then into the bread crumbs.  My husband said it was better than fried, and he is PICKY about his chicken.  The chicken was extremely moist and I was pleasantly surprised.  My kids LOVED it and I will definately make it again!!

Really good. I used what I had on hand. I crushed ritz crackers for the crumbs I used the spices in the recipe and added a dash on cayanne for a little kick. I also thinned the mayo a bit like others did I used some Hidden Valley light Ranch dressing (I used lite mayo). I made this with a jumbo pack of thighs that I skinned and there were only three left. I served it with biscuits and country gravy. Yum!

Edit: I forgot to state that I cooked the chicken on a large cookie cooling rack that was placed on a baking sheet pan. This allows the hot air to get to the bottom of the chicken and you wont get soggy bottoms.

This is a delicious recipe but I made a few changes the second time that made it better.  Instead of breadcrumbs, I used Panko breading which in can get in Asian food markets quite easily.  Panko is usually used for tempura coating and gives the chicken a better taste and crunch.  The thyme was also too strong so I used some poultry seasoning and Old Bay seasoning to add some spice.  Also, the cooking temp. was better at 375 degrees, which cooked the chicken quicker and left it more moist.  I usually like skin-on, but with the mayo coating, leaving the skin on made it a bit too greasy so the second time I took all the skin off and it tasted great.  Don't overdo the mayo coating or it could get to greasy or make the bread coating soggy in some spots.  My toddler and husband loved it.  This one is a keeper.

This was a great recipe.  I did make changes though.  I used chicken breasts instead, followed other reviewers to use less mayo and add milk, also floured beforehand.  When I was getting ready to put this in the oven, I saw on the back of the bread crumb package a recipe similar to this and it stated to cook at 425 degrees for 40 minutes, so I cooked the chicken at 400 degrees for 20 minutes per side and it was very crispy and the chicken was so moist and tender, almost falling apart.  Will make again.

OH MY GOD!!!  I read mayonaise and thought "That's crazy", then I read some of the positive reviews regarding the mayo and thought those people were crazy too but hey, I AM CRAZY!!!  What a wonderful recipe.  My only substitutions due to not having them around were soda crackers crushed up instead of bread crumbs and miracle whip instead of mayonaise.  1/2 a cup of mayo is definately enough.  Juicy, tender chicken (even the white meat!) with a great flavor.  I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  We had guests over for supper and all I kept hearing from him and my husband was "Mmmm, this is really good."  Words are not enough, good-bye shake'n bake, hello oven fried chicken...  this will definately become a regular in my house!!!

Great recipe if you're looking for "fried" chicken without all the fat! I used a pound of boneless chicken breasts for this recipe and it turned out really good.  I added a little cornmeal to the bread crumb mix as well as a bit of onion powder. No matter what mix of spices you use it's all a matter of personal taste. Whenever I do regular fried chicken I always use buttermilk, so to coat the chicken I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's lite mayo and thinned that out with buttermilk. I dipped that and then the chicken into the bread crumb mixture vs. shaking it in a bag. I let it set until the coating became a little "pasty" in nature. I sprayed the bottom of a baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick. I baked it for 25 minutes then turned it and baked it for the remainder of the time. I would advise against turning it any more than that or the coating will come off. This turned out very moist and juicy!

This was oh so yummy!  My husband HATES fried chicken but he adored this simple recipe.  I cooked 6 drumsticks (skin on, of course!) and I needed to adjust the cooking times and temps as follows:  350 for 45 minutes, then raise to 375 for 15 minutes.  I believe this is what also made them come out crispy as well.  So moist, just like they said!

Years ago I tasted an oven-fried chicken made with a mayo coating - and I've been searching ever since for this recipe!  And here it is!
I made it with chicken tenders, crushed garlic croutons for crumbs - and I baked it at 425 degrees, turning the tenders after 15 minutes, and baking them for an additional 10 minutes.  WONDERFUL - and thank you so much for the recipe!

Very easy and tasty. However, 1C was too much mayonnaise - next time I will start with 1/2C.

Absolutely delish!!! A five star +++. excellent. What I did first was read everyone's postings and suggestions. I made a low-fat buttermilk ranch dressing, from this website. I used half of that and half of mayonnaise to coat the chicken right before breading. I also marinated the chicken in buttermilk seasoned with salt and black pepper the night before. I then coated the chicken in 3/4 cup panko, which I always have on hand, and 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs, salt, paprika and black pepper. I placed chicken on a cookie cooling sheet on top of a regular baking sheet lined with foil. I set the oven at 400 degrees, baking 25 minutes on each side (flipping) to ensure an even crispy coating. Chicken was crispy on outide, juicy on inside and you could not even tell it was not deep fried in oil, which is the best part of this recipe. Panko breading turned out great. I served this with macaroni and cheese also from this website along with veggies. hubby said "Wow, chicken is AWESOME," chicken is so soft and tender and juicy he licked his fingers too. He also added that, "It tastes better baked this way and it looks and tastes like its deep fried in oil only it's not. great!"

We absolutely love this recipe!! The chicken is so moist and tender and it is so easy and quick to fix. We even used different types of bread crumbs (and cans of bread crumbs are only around $1) and changes it up a bit. I do not even think I will be making fried chicken on the stovetop anymore. It is so nice to not have to deal with the grease and mess of frying. Recommend this one!

The whole family loved it!  I used chicken thighs & followed the suggestions of others: 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. milk, 1/4 c. ranch dressing; Japanese Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I didn't use bags (too messy); used shallow bowls (one for mayo mix; one for the dry mix.)  I sprayed Pam on a rack before placing the chicken on it; baked on a @375 for 50 minutes (golden brown & crispy) then I turned the chicken over & baked another 15 minutes @400 (golden brown & crispy.)  The important thing is to get a big enough rack/pan so that the chicken pieces aren't touching each other, otherwise, the sides of the chicken don't get golden brown & crispy.  Easy & yummy recipe...I baked twice in one week!

I thought this chicken was very tender and the coating was great.  It had an unusal flavor that my family did not like.  Next time I make it I am going to leave out the tyme and add spices that we like.

OUTSTANDING!!! I made a few of the same changes others made: add a splash of milk to the mayonnaise, and use only 1/2 cup of mayo. I used 5 medium sized chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I also used saltines because I was out of bread crumbs. I then combined the following seasonings in a small bowl: 3/4 t garlic powder, 1 1/2 T seasoned salt, and 2 t ground pepper. I then divided the seasoning mix in half and put half of it with the saltines and the other half I mixed in with the mayo/milk. YUMMO! The outside was crispy, the inside moist and flavorful. I also coated the bottom of the Pyrex with EVOO. I baked at 400 for about 30 minutes and it came out perfect! Thanks so much for sharing this one.

This is my go to recipe for oven fried chicken! LOVE IT! some tips and ideas.. first for all you anti mayo people - you dont have to use mayo.  what you need is something for the breadcrumbs to stick to. that is the purpose of the mayo.  and you don't "GOOP" it on, 
use a basting brush for the mayo, or whatever base you're using to keep the bread crumbs on.  My daughter calls it painting the chicken!and it can be fun (keep in mind that chicken needs to be handled carefully re salmonella and all that - standard operating practice there)you can keep the base thin or thick as you like. AND you can add seasonings to your mayo like dry packaged ranch, italian or PESTO! garlic, onion!, you know your family's tastes best! and  you can also use whatever base you want! Try thousand island dressing! Ranch! Sour Cream! Yoghurt! Low calorie, full calorie... so many choices! Also, if you use a salad dressing or thinned yoghurt you can marinate!!!just take the pieces out and press into your crumbs.  and now for the breadcrumbs - again so many choices based on what you have on hand or prefer:  Crushed croutons, Cornflakes, Crackers of any kind crushed, potatochips even -  This is a FUN recipe! thanks so much for posting!

I give all 5 stars for taste, tender/juicyness. I added some milk with the mayo and added 2 heaping tablespoons of miracle whip and just added more or less mayo in a bowl and whisked til my desired thickness. Threw all chicken pieces into a gallon storage bag and poured mixture over it, made sure well coated, let it sit in fridge for a couple of hours til I was ready to cook it up. I turned the heat up to 375 and baked it for an hour and 20 minutes {I have to use a convection oven}. When done I let chicken rest for 10 minutes, it was so good! Any crumbs that fell off when eating I put in my mashed potatoes for crunch, yummy stuff. No more shake and bake here. Even reheated in oven, it crisped back up and stayed juicy, especially the dark meat. this recipe is awesome!

This recipe is the best for oven baked chicken out there. At least from what I've tried. Although the mayo part of the recipe may seem a little weird, you can't really taste it at all when everything has been baked through. I do halve the mayo and add milk or buttermilk in it's place to make the chicken easier to coat. Also, I suggest making double the crumb mix as I always seem to run out of it at the end. Maybe the chicken pieces I use are giant? 

I too, have had problems with soggy bottoms of chicken even while cooking them on cookie cooling racks however I figured out that cooking them in convection mode in the oven over a cookie rack crisps them up really nicely. Just cut the time down a little and watch them carefully. Also, it's fun to play with the herbs and spices with this recipes ie. adding parmesan or oregano, old bay, basil, etc.

Yum!  I pounded chicken breasts flat and then sliced into tenders, (about 3-4 per breast).  I did dilute the mayo with milk.  Used Panko bread crumbs with onion powder, Old Bay, seasoned salt and garlic and paprika.  Cooked on cookie sheet in 400 over for 20 minutes, then flipped with tongs and baked another 20 minutes.  Served with mashed potatoes and gravy and it was like we were at KFC!

Great tasting alternative to fries chicken. Being a southern girl, I love my fired chicken but this is a wonderful option that is much healthier. My picky husband liked it very much.  I also used Panko crumbs, which I think add more crunch and will use a cookie rack next time to keep underside of chicken from getting soggy!

I loved the flavor from the mayo.  I followed a suggestion and turned the pieces over halfway through cooking time, and that was very good advice.  Next time, I'll thin down the mayo so that I can dip instead of "smear" it on by hand.

I am 81 and have been legally blind for about 10 years. I love to cook, and use recipes with the least ingredients and simple instructions. This is a wonderful basic recipe.  I have used it for years, but have now incorporated my pre-mixed seasonings .usually from this site) using Greek Seasoning for this one. And over time have opted, instead of just mayo, to mix 1/2 cup Miracle Whip, 2 TBLS milk and 1/2 tsp each garlic and onion powders, which has become my favorite brush-on paste. Nice recipe, tanks for posting. Love all of your comments. Even though I changed this recipe, I still think that it deserves a 5-Star rating. Bobbi J

I have to say this was a GREAT starting point! I liked the mayo idea because essentially mayo is eggs and oil. So I took the chicken breast and sprinkled it with Hidden Valley Ranch powder, red hot sauce, black pepper, and cayenne. Then I spread the mayo on with a brush and let it sit for 5 mins while I crushed the reduced fat ritz crackers. I put the crumbs on the chicken then placed it on cooling racks on a foiled lined cookie sheet. I baked at 350 for 15 mins then kicked up to 425 to finish it off. It was crispy and tender!  IT WAS AWESOME! DH couldn't get enough. It was a great meal. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

WOW! I was hesitant to use mayonnaise but decided like many viewers to follow the recipe to a "T" (except I used boneless skinless breasts), and I'm glad I did. I didn't use plain bread crumbs but instead used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and the flavor was off the chain. The end product was juicy, moist, flavorful, crisp, and in my household all gone. This is definitely one that will be used in my family on a regular basis.

So moist! So flavorful!  I did follow the advise of one reviewer and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 milk. This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!

Delicious crispy fried chicken done with a slight change as per other reviews. I mixed half milk and half mayonnaise with 2 tbsp of ceasar salad dressing (I didn't have ranch like other reviewers) . I only used boneless skinless chicken breasts so maybe that is why it did take longer than 45 minutes.

I make this recipe a little bit different.Instead of putting it in a casserole baking dish, I put the chicken on a cooling on rack on a foil lined cookie sheet.  This enables the chicken to get crispy on the bottom instead of the bottom getting soggy.

WOW~I made three times the amount of the recipe because I have such a large family, but it came out perfect! The only thing I did differently was use Light Mayo instead of regular mayo. I also used 4 tbs of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing to give it a kick~boy was I right on time! This recipe was awesome the way it was written and with the Ranch! I made two different batches so that I can try the recipe and try the my own flava with this recipe~ it worked out great both ways!

This was very easy and extremely tasty.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Obviously, you could vary/change the spice and herbs added to suit your desires.

Almost too moist! Would work well with chicken breasts. I would thin the mayo like others suggested. Also god idea to put up on wire racks in your baking dish so the grease can drip down. The thyme is strong...might try rosemary or cilantro next time.

This was the first time I've ever made fried chicken. Boy did I pick the right recipe! I used 10 drumsticks with skin removed. I dredged in flour, then rolled in a mixture of 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup milk (had quite a bit leftover when done), then shook in a large resealable bag with the seasoned breadcrumbs. I placed drumsticks on a cooling rack over a broiler pan and cooked @ 400* for 50 minutes. Chicken was crispy and flavourful outside and moist inside. Kids liked it and hubby said he'd rate it a 5/5. Definitely a keeper!

I feel bad writing this but this recipe was definitely not a winner. Very very greasy. Maybe fried chicken is supposed to be so greasy? Wasn't expecting it to be sooooo greasy. And not very flavorful. Definitely needed more salt. Used bread crumbs and it was very flavorless. Going to look for another recipe and make chicken noodle soup out of the breasts.

I make a similar recipe using Panko Bread Crumbs; if you want to "kick this recipe up a notch", add a table spoon of hot sauce (I use Franks) and a quarter cup of parmesan cheese to the mayo and mix well before coating the chicken.

Delicious.Not bland at all.Just remember to use only 1/2 a cup of mayo, and add a little milk.Also instead of Thyme,used 1/2 tsp Basil,1/2 tsp oregano.It does need to be baked at least 45 mins on 350 and then 15 mins on 375.Next time I will leave the skin on as suggested by other reviewers.

Hubby, a beef man, liked this and said it was a "keeper".  I used 4 large chicken thighs and got down and messy with them using 3/4 cup of mayo mixed with 1/4 cup of half & half with garlic powder added.  I then coated them with seasoned bread crumbs, not using a baggy, and baked them @ 375 degees on a rack sprayed with Pam cooking spray on a cookie sheet for 45 minutes and then flipped them over for 15 minutes @ 400 degrees while I made rice-a-roni to serve on the side. This turned out to be a very yummy meal and I will make it again! Thanks for a good basic recipe that will be a new family favorite.

We really liked this recipe.  It's not fried chicken but it is EXCELLENT crispy, baked chicken.  I spread low-fat Miracle Whip directly on the chicken pieces.  Like other reviewers, I "kicked up" the spices -- I added poultry seasoning, Tony Cachere cajun seasoning and a touch of cayenne.  I used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 panko crumbs as the panko adds extra crispiness to the chicken.  I baked the chicken on a cooling rack placed on top of a cookie sheet covered with foil for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then turned up the heat to 375 and baked for 15 additional minutes to brown up the crust.  My husband does NOT like Shake n' Bake but he loved this chicken. This is definitely in our regular rotation -- fried chicken like without the dealing with the oil (and healthier too)!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, expect I used chicken thighs that I skinned myself.  Out of 3 children, none liked it.  I thought it was edible, but wasn't excited about it.  It is barely different from "Shake & Bake."  I was hoping for something better....  My 9 year old said, "Mom, please don't make this chicken again."

Delicious.  I used breasts and cut into chucks for quicker cooking.  Added a pinch of cayenne pepper and old bay seasoning.  I try to be "green" and used a bowl to shake the chicken and spices together.  The kids and husband said 4.75 stars.  I served with couscous.

This chicken is amazing! So juicy! You can't even tell mayo is in it. All I did different is use ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs and add a bit of onion powder to the mix. I will make as a family favorite forever!

The mayonnaise is a great idea!  The chicken stayed very moist, and was very flavorful.  I used corn flakes and ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs because I like the coating to be crispier.  The ritz crackers add a buttery flavor without using butter (I can't eat dairy).  The possibilities are endless as far as the breading goes.  The mayo is what makes this recipe.  4 starts because I didn't love the paprika and thyme.  Maybe it just needed less of them.  It was also quite salty- but that was probably my fault for not eliminating the salt in the recipe when I added the crackers.

I was disappointed by this recipe.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a recipe so well-rated on this webpage!  I've made real fried chicken in oil one time before and it called for the chicken to be brined.  I felt like maybe that is what this recipe needed??  It had the moistness and I guess the crunch of the bread crumbs but the chicken really lacked flavor!  When I made the fried chicken in oil, I just could not stop taking another bite, even though it wasn't perfect.  But with this bake fried chicken, I just could not bring myself to eat a lot of it.  I know the two recipes are not the same but I just didn't think this was good.  I'm not heavily into salty foods, fried foods, or a picky eater.  I eat rather plain and have been happy with a variety of recipes offered on this webpage.  Just not this one.  I even went through the first few helpful reviews too to make changes.  Overall it was just bland.  I felt like the blandness was in the chicken meat, even though the bread crumb seasoning could be bumped up too.  I used leg and thigh meat with skin on.  Leaving skin on made it harder to eat.

DEEEEE-LISH! Here are the changes I made, although I think this would be a 5 star recipe as written.  We used skinless chicken breasts, I mixed mayo and buttermilk rather than using all mayo, and I added some onion powder and cayenne to the breading.  I also followed another poster who recommended 400 deg. 20 minutes per side, and it turned out really well (but again this was with boneless skinless breasts, not a whole chicken)

Amazing. Didn't use dried thyme, I didn't have any. Added cayenne & onion powder. Also use it for chicken cubes, it's amazing also.

Great recipe! I added milk to the mayo like people suggested, made it very easy to just dip the chicken in it. I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into strips and baked at 375 for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through. They were crispy in some places in mushy in others (the reason I'm only giving this 4 stars), but the flavor was AMAZING! Super easy, too. I will definitely make this again!

I used ranch salad dressing instead of the mayonnaise and also added a little cayenne for some extra kick.  Delicious!

This recipe was quite good. I was very skeptical because oven baked fried chicken just didn't seem good nor did it seem easy.  I was so wrong. this particular recipe was simple and quick. I used chicken breast cause I'm watchin' my calories and it turned out great.  I diluted the mayo with non-fat milk like the other recipes and added a little too much cayenne :) but it was still good.  It definately filled the void of missing fried chicken.  I will play with the seasoning next time just because I can. Awesome.

I took the suggestion many others have made and tried this with panko bread crumbs.  What a difference!  With regular bread crumbs this was just OK, but with panko the chicken was delicious!  I also coat the chicken in a mixture of 1/2 milk, 1/2 mayo and a couple of TBS of ranch salad dressing instead of just plain mayo.

When I saw the mayo I thought, WEIRD!! I debated in even making this chicken recipe because of the mayo. But I thought "Let's make something different, it can't be that bad! Even if it is I'll eat it because I won't waste it" I followed the recipe but I added chili powder and baked it at 350 for 45 min and 375 for another 15 to get it a little more crisp. OMG!! I wasn't expecting it to be so moist and flavorful! I mean I baked chicken for an hour and it wasn't dry at all! I could cut the breast with a fork!! The mayo tenderized the  out of the chicken, haha! This is the best chicken recipe I've ever made and I got so many compliments. My 2 yr old asked for seconds! My husband couldn't stop raving over it. As you can tell I'm absolutely amazed at this recipe. The mayo might throw you off, but don't let it, because it's soooooo worth it!!! YOU MUST MAKE THIS RECIPE! haha :)

Oven fried chicken is one of my comfort foods... so I am VERY picky about it.  This recipe is nothing like my mom/grandma's recipe.  The fact that I loved this chicken anyway tells you it's a great recipe!  I did omit the salt (we're trying to cut back, and the chicken was injected with "broth"--which means extra salt).  We're a Miracle Whip family, so I used that in place of Mayo.  I also only measured out 1/2 cup for 7 thighs (skin-on, of course) and still had plenty left, so next time I think I'll start with 1/3 cup.  I baked them for 25 minutes, skin-side down, then flipped them over and baked them anoter 25 minutes to crisp the skin up.  DELICIOUS.  The meat was still tender and juicy, the skin nice and crispy, and the drippings made excellent gravy, too.  I will be making this again and again.  I may even abandon my family's recipe, but shhh... don't tell my grandma that!

I agree with other reviews that the result was a tad bit greasy..and if you don't love mayonnaise, you may not enjoy the taste as much, but it was fairly crispy and hubby loved it......I took the suggestion and mixed 1/2 cup of mayo with milk. Seasoning was very good. Will make again, but use less mayo.

WOW!!!! I have never had such a delicious "fried" chicken recipe. I made some adjustments based on other reviews. I used the 1 to 1 ratio of light mayo and Hidden Valley light ranch...what an amazing combo! It kept the chicken moist and gave a great zip in taste.  I also used crushed/crunched corn flakes because I didn't have enough bread crumbs, and I think that made all the difference in the crispiness factor. Using the cookie cooling rack while baking made sure no side was soggy. I also changed the temp for the last 15 minutes, as another reviewer suggested. WHAT A GREAT MEAL!!!!!

This recipe was pretty tasty. I added some parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture (about 1/2 cup). I used drumb sticks and thighs instead of the whole chicken. I took the skin of half the pieces, and left it on the other half, just to experiment. The pieces with the skin left on were deffinetly juicer and more flavorfull. We found the pieces without skin were very dry. All in all though, this recipe was not bad.

All I can say is Oh my gosh this is good!  I couldn't quite grasp the concept of the mayo at first as a coating on the chicken and figured I would try it.  I had 14 good size drum pieces in a bowl and because of others saying 1 cup of mayo was too much, I started with 1/2 cup and just used my hands even though it was gross to do it this way at first, it made sense..I just took each piece and slathered it with a thin but even coat of the mayo. I found 1/2 cup of the mayo was plenty.  I then dredged each piece through the breadcrumb mixture and coated it evenly and put it in the pan and let them cook without turning it.  My husband must have said "This is Good" 10 times!!  The mayo must seal in the flavor because this was very moist and yummy.  You can season the breadcrumb mixture any way you desire.  I added red pepper powder to mine to kick it up a little in the flavor.  I will definately cook this again!!  Very kid friendly...better than shake and bake!   I also liked it cause it didn't require an eggs or flour.  Everyone has Mayo in the fridge!!   Thanks Elizabeth!!

The flavor was good, but it never really got crispy. In retrospect, I think I used a "too small" baking dish. It probably would have been helpful to use a baking dish where the chicken wasn't crowded. I might also try halving the butter, as well.

This is a good recipe if you want something different from regular fried chicken.  However, as written, it is not "healthier" than pan or deep fried chicken, it is actually higher in fat and calories.  If you don't believe me, check out the nutrition information for the Crispy Fried Chicken recipe!  It is definitely less messy and tastes good though!

Love this recipe!  I have made this several times followed other reviewers advice added a little milk to the mayo.  I have adjusted or modified spices, but just for our preferences.  I also followed a reviewers advice and placed on a rack so the chicken would not got "soggy" on bottom.  Great recipe!!!  Mayonnaise is the trick.

I have read that this is messy to make and is very greasy. It is a bit messy but well worth the effort. I only used 1/2 the mayo and watered it down a bit. As for the grease, use a rack on top of your pan and it will be crispy without the soggy grease.

I will be making this chicken recipe often, it's that yummy! I subbed the thyme with Mrs. Dash and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup half and half (I needed to use it up). I used a cookie cooling rack on top of a foil (sprayed )lined cookie sheet as others suggested. The chicken (boneless) was so tender you could cut it easily with a fork. Thanks for the recipe!

I love fried chicken, but hate the mess so rarely make it.  I would have never made fried chicken after working all day until I found this recipe.  It's easy and tastes great!  I didn't have enough bread crumbs so I mixed panko crumbs in with them and seasoned with garlic powder, thyme and seasoned salt.  I used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and had some left, so next time may try using even less.  I cooked skin side down for the first half hour, turned once and finished cooking.  I cooked at 375 for one hour total as someone suggested and it resulted in a crunchy outside and moist and juicy inside.  I used 6 chicken thighs instead of a cut up whole chicken.

I used 6 pieces of chicken (3 legs, 3 thighs). I used homemade breadcrumbs and opted to use 2 tsps. of a homemade seasoning blend instead the garlic powder, dried thyme, paprika & ground black pepper. Kept the salt amount the same. I reduced the mayo to roughly half a cup and thinned it with half a cup of 2% milk (kind of like a faux buttermilk). I coated as directed, but used a rack on a cookie sheet to avoid soggy bottoms. I baked at 400F for 15 mins, then lowered to 350F for the last half hour. Tasted good.

I wanted "fried" chicken and this was really good.  Made a pack of chicken thighs. I kept the kids happy by leaving skin on thighs and then removed skin for me and hubby.  Came out great.  I added 1/2 panko bread crumbs and 1/2 italian bread crumbs to make a sure crispy.  Followed other advise and baked on rack in roaster to keep from sitting in grease.  Great!

Wow the flavor of this was amazing! I used a half cup of mayo and about 2 tbsp of spicy ranch dressing whisked together. The only problem I had was I didnt use non stick aluminum foil so the breading stuck to the foil when i tried taking them out. All in all it was delicious though, will definitely make again.

I dont know what happened but my crust just fell right off the chicken...I followed the recipe to an extent...half mayo/half milk (instead of the original amount of mayo), 1 egg (more binding), I used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs because thats what I had on hand...etc. and I used drumsticks. Other than the crust falling off the chicken, it was incredibly juicy and yummy! Maybe I'll just have to play around with it.

I make mine mostly the same, but not this much mayonnaise. And, instead of all bread crumbs, I use equal parts bread crumbs and panko breadcrumbs and add in a few tablespoons of cornstarch. And start on 400' and then reduce after about 15 minutes.

i thought this recipe was GREAT! i took a tip from Bobby Flay and marinated my chicken in buttermilk for no less than 4 hours (it helps the chicken stay tender and juicy). i read some reviews and instead of 1C. of mayo, i added a half cup of milk, some sour cream, mayo and ranch dressing. i also added some poultry seasoning to the bread crumb and panko mix i used for the crust. i also put a little cayenne for a little bite. i used chicken tenders b/c i dont eat meat off bones. i cooked it at 450 for 15min and turned the strips and then cooked it for another 10min. my boyfriend loved it too. this is deffently a keeper. i never would have thought to use mayo for fried chicken!!

Unimpressed for the most part. I have tired a number of oven baked/fried chicken recipes including some commercial products. This one produced juicy chicken but the crust/coating was unappealing.   I make a few changes based on other reviews. First of all I used chicken legs. I raised the oven temperature to 375 and cooked for 1 hour. Several complained of bland flavor and I wanted to spice it up a touch. I mixed my mayo with a couple of good dashes of hot sauce as well as a liberal sprinkling of cayenne pepper. I also upped the seasoning in the bread crumbs with more cayenne, black pepper, and used both regular and smoked paprika. I also left out the thyme.   The chicken had a nice bit of flavor with the extra spice but the texture of the coating was just off. Not really crispy and not totally soggy either. It did not adhere well to the chicken and was a bit sandy for a lack of a better word. I will probably not try this one again although I am sure I will still be on the look out for a good oven fried recipe.

This is delicious! At first I was skeptical about the mayonnaise but I couldn't even taste it! For the users who complain it got too clumpy, I didn't have this issue, but I also got nice and messy (which definitely catered to my inner child lol) and grabbed a glob of mayonnaise and spread it all over the chicken. You gotta get dirty with this one (come on, indulge your inner child)! I used all chicken breasts as that's what I had and prefer. I loved dipping the finished product in hot sauce...I'm salivating now thinking about another piece dipped in hot sauce! :)

This was really simple to make, but the taste was just average. I used half mayo and half milk, otherwise followed the recipe.

This recipe was a hit!  I substituted oregano for the thyme, added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and took others' recommendation of using a half mayo, half milk mixture with a little Ranch dressing.  I'd make this recipe again for sure!

The recipe was fantastic, I mixed ingredients together with breasts and thighs as directed, I then placed them in my rotisserie rack and cooked on the BBQ instead of the oven. I had them turn for about 45 min on medium-hi. Simply amazing! Gibby

Used other reviewers suggestion of mixing 1/2 cup mayonnaise with 1/2 cup of milk and Panko instead of bread crumbs.  Placed chicken on a foil lined cookie sheet which I had greased with olive oil and baked in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes.  It was perfect! Nice and crispy on outside and moist and tender inside. Husband said it was as good as his mother's fried chicken.  This was the ultimate compliment!  Thanks for sharing your great recipe Elizabeth.  I will be making this again.

This is a great recipe!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I expected it to be more crispy.  The bottom gets a little soggy but the chicken is so juicy I didn't mind.  The second time I made them I tried to turn them half way through but still soggy and the breading started to slide off during turning. The third time...I added a little milk and a dash of worcestershire sauce ...still soggy.  I'm determined!!  Don't let this deterr you...The flavor is excellent!!  I know...Mayo??  but it's tasty.

Soooooo delish!  I customized it for my kids by adding a spice mix they really like, and they inhaled it!  This is my middle son's favorite thing EVER!  I've made it a few times, and he goes wild whenever he smells the "fried" chicken!  Oh, and I used lowfat mayo this time, and it turned out just fine.

Very pleasantly suprised.  Great flavor & moist. I did thin down the light mayo w/ milk.  I used Panko breadcrumbs.  You may want to add the spices on the meat after the breadcrumbs because it sinks to the bottom and until your about out of crumbs is where all the spices are left in the bag.  So some of the chicken was alittle more spicy than others.  I used the ranch dipping sauce for the tenders/ strips I made.  Will make again.

Have tried a few oven fried chicken recipes, over the years, and this was, by far, the best...I'm sure that the mayo was the biggest factor...I used panko bread crumbs for a little added crunch...this recipe has definately been added into the rotation...thank you!

Very nice!! I didn't have a full cup of bread crumbs (and I only had italian seasoned), so I used 1/2 cup of crushed cornflakes to make up for it - and BOY did it turn out great! I mixed the dry ingredients and poured half onto a large dish. Instead of dipping the chicken into the mayo, I used my hands to rub on a very thin layer. (I only used about 1/4 cup of light mayo). Placed the mayo rubbed chicken onto the breadding then sprinkled the remainder of the chicken with the rest. It started preparations sooner than I should have so I let it sit for about an hour... well this may have been the ultimate secret to keeping the breading from falling off during baking! The chicken came out perfectly crispy, tender and delicious! Thank you!

Will try with skin off next time :)

Easy, and very good. I also cut the mayo with some ranch dressing, and I added the spices straight into the mayo/ranch mix, instead of into the crumb mix. Nice, crunch crust and moist chicken. I will definitly use this recipe again.

Yum! This was delicious. I'd never have thought that mayonnaise would work on chicken, but it did. I made a few modifications: I used flour on the chicken before dipping it in the mayo. Instead of straight mayonnaise, I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard and just enough milk to make it easy to coat the chicken with. I also added a teaspoon of oregano and basil to the breading. I'll definitely make this again!

I've made this chicken many times and my friends and I were always pleased. I've seasond the crumb mixture with cajun spice for a decilous spicy chicken. I also have added poultry seasoning and seasoned salt for excellent results-but if your into spicy chicken let the cajun spice flow freely!

Just a very decent tried & true recipe.  I've made it several times.  Versatile.  This particular time I used bone in chicken breasts ... took off skin. Used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 ranch dressing & Panko breadcrumbs.  Cooked 50 min @ 350.

We love fried chicken in this house and this is the new favorite recipe! For me, who loves fried chicken but can't afford to have it all the time, now I can enjoy having it a lot more often. Great taste, great crunch, no guilt! Thank you for this recipe.

I tried this recipe tonight.I was a bit skeptical with mayo. I only had chipotle mayo which I mixed with miracle whip. I also used panko bread crumbs, I just like them better than regular. The turnout super delicious. I will definitely make this chicken again.

This recipe was better than delicious. And, I am a Southern Girl.   I used the Panko bread crumbs as suggested in the video. Found that I needed to double the amount of bread crumb mixture.  I used about 3 lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken thighs; cooked them on 350 for 30 minutes and then 500 for 5 minutes...needed the extra heat to make them crunchy!!!

Every time I make this it comes out great. Follow the directions or by using some of the modifications you see here in reviews.
My favorite modification is to use crackers, fresh thyme and garlic w peppercorns ran through the food processor. I have even added parmesan cheese in the processor.
Have always had great complements when I've made this dish. Definitely  one to add yo your recipe box.

Great weeknight meal.  Very tasty.  I didn't change the ingredients but I did change the temperature/time after the first time I cooked it.  Cook at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes.  This avoids the sogginess I experienced the first time.

This is an awesome recipe. I made a few changes, but the most notable was leaving out the mayo. I used plain greek yogurt and my chicken was so moist and delicious! I will for sure make this dish again.

I made this last night for my family, they loved it.. I used a spicy chiptole mayonnaise to add extra flavor. I also used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs. I would have loved if my chicken was darker.. however it was GREAT... Thanks... to all !

I did what mommyfromseattle suggested with the old bay and poultry seasoning, and also cut the mayo with half milk. This one's a keeper!

My family prefers oven fried to the real thing. I always cut my mayo with milk too. I use panko crumbs and crushed fried onion rings for breading.
Sometimes, I'll also add in some crushed cheese-its or goldfish crackers as well.
Last, but not least, the crumbs must have (according to #1 son) a big helping of garlic powder. Mashed potatoes and white gravy on the side. Mmmmm!

This wasn't a bad recipe, but not my favorite.  I prefer chicken recipes with flour breading and not so much thyme seasoning.

This is the second time I've made this dish. The first time I thought it was a little greasy due to the mayo. I decreased that this time and diluted with milk. In this mixture, I added some spices including cayenne. We like our chicken spicy. Also, used panko this time along with the spices listed and little bit more of the cayenne and paprika. Thanks Elizabeth! What a great concept.

Superb!!! Followed other reviewers advice and thinned mayo with milk. I used ready jointed, herb coated chicken portions from our local supermarket. To cut the fat content I used low fat, light mayo mixed with skimmed milk and garlic paste (didn't have garlic powder). I then added the paprika, a little salt and black pepper. Not having breadcrumbs I crushed whole wheat breakfast cereal (weetabix in the UK). You could use corn or bran flakes instead. I put the portions on a rack as others suggested so the fat could drain off and raised the heat. Result - lovely crisp outside and very moist and tasty inside. As these adaptations are lower in fat than the original recipe it makes this version an absolute winner for the health and diet conscious!!! Well done Elizabeth!!! More recipes like this PLEASE !!!

I've been making this recipe for years sans mayo.  The one time I made it with mayo, I didn't like it.  You can use pretty much anything in place of it though.  I'm a big fan of buttermilk.  I've also used a yogurt and milk mix in the past.   I also rotate different items in for crunch.  Cornflake crumbs works well as do crushed most crushed crackers, Pepperidge Farm goldfish, and pretzels.

Made this last evening.  Followed the recipe exactly except put the chicken in a large foil pan with a cookie rack inside it so the chicken did not sit in the grease on the bottom.  Very crispy & delicious.  My husband loved it!!!!!!  Added to my recipe box as I will most deffinitely make this again!

Very good outcome. I was uncomfortable with the idea of mayo, but followed the recipe just as written except that I only had about 1/4 tsp dried thyme left, and subbed it with poultry seasoning. I was very surprised by how crispy the coating was. This is going to replace 'fried' chicken in our home, so thank you for a lovely and quite easy recipe!

Very good!  Even good cold the next day. Didn't have breadcrumbs, used a small packet of  croutons (leftover from a salad) and crushed saltines. After reading other reviews, I used 1/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup  ranch dressing. and 1/3 cup mayo. Baked at 375 degrees on a roaster rack (sprayed with  Pam)on top of a cookie sheet.

This turned out much better than I expected, tastes better than fried chicken especially if using panko crumbs instead.  The only tweaks I made was I used chicken drumsticks (6 of them removed the skin) and baked it at 425F for 40 mins. Flipping them half way during the bake time. I used 1/2 cup of mayo instead with a splash of milk to thin it out to coat the meat more evenly. Used only 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme. Will definitely be making this again!

We love fried chicken..but I HATE Mayo..so subbed it with fat free sour cream..the taste was Xcellent and less fattening! The family love it.  I also set the oven as many have suggested to 375..quicker and the chicken stays moist.  All in all..would make again. But working on another recipe for oven fried chicken...When using bread crumbs or Panko, make sure you watch the amount of additional seasoning. For these already have some in them.

This was VERY tasty, and the breading looks beautiful on the chicken.  I took the advice of another and used a wire cooling rack on a cookie sheet to bake the chicken thinking it'd be nice and crispy.  Well, that didn't happen.  I ended up with a "graham crackery" breading that was soft and came off when cutting the meat.  Disappointing.  I may try it again, and add a little olive oil to the breading and hope that it crisps up under the broiler.

Excellent. It turned out a bit soggy for me, but I'm not so hot at the cooking thing yet. I added cumin and a dash of chili powder to give it a bit of added flavor, as well as used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Also, I did what a lot of people recommended, and put in some milk with the mayo.  The flavor was absolutely awesome. Wasn't super crispy, and the breading sort of fell off, but I think I attribute that to operator error.

This was really good. Used chicken breasts only and cut into tender-sized pieces. Used some alternate cooking times. Brushed on mayo so as to use very little, just enough to let bread crumbs stick. Flipped halfway through cooking time. Very yummy!

Great recipe!  I use whole wheat breadcrumbs to make healthier, plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise and Tony Chachere's for a spicy kick instead of the spices listed and I just use boneless, skinless chicken breasts but they are always moist, my toddlers love them and so does my husband!

Good alternative recipe to frying. I used a spicy mayo to coat chicken and cayenne instead of paprika. We like it hot!! Also, for all of the "soggy" reviews-I sprayed a baking sheet with cooking spray. Turned the chicken half way through. In the last few minutes of cooking, I turned the oven on broil. I then removed it and laid it on paper towels to cool, which soaked up the grease. It was tasty and crispy!

I expected this to be a bit more tasty. It was rather bland, although my husband liked it. I think the key is in the type of bread crumbs you choose. I will experiment with that next time. Thanks!

Great recipe for those of us who can't really do fried foods!  My only change is that I used Panko bread crumbs for extra crispy chicken and I put the chicken on a sprayed cooling rack on my baking sheet to cook so the heat could crisp it up on all sides at once.  Totally delish! My grandkids loved it!

Loved this chicken.  I did make some changes based on others reviews, instead of mayonnaise I used Ranch Salad Dressing which I thinned down with some milk, I didn't use thyme - instead I used poultry seasoning and I added about 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese to the bread crumbs.  I also used only chicken legs.  The chicken was so moist and delicious.  My son who is a very picky eater, ate 3 pieces.  Will make again and again!

Really good! I used all drumsticks and it took more like 55 minutes, but it was yummy. My picky kiddos loved it! We had no leftovers!

I use a very similar recipe for my boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Of course, you need to season the chicken before you put the mayo on, and not put the mayo on too thick. I use Best Foods Olive Oil Mayo. I did not have any breadcrumbs, so I crushed up some Everything Ritz crackers - delicious! I also mix a little seasoning into the mayo before spreading it on. Moist, delicious and tasty!

Tried it; didn't like it.  Too oily and not enough seasoning.  If we're going to eat this much fat in our chicken, I'll just use my family's old recipe and fry it.

I had been craving fried chicken and mashed potatoes, but I didn't want to do all that work and I really didn't want all the fat. So I did this instead, I used bone/skinless breasts. Then, I sliced them in half length wise. Coated w/ mayo and milk and Mrs. Dash. Coating them in panko & plain dry crumbs and seasonings I like.
  400' about 30min.On the rack/cookie sheet and ripped halfway thru.
  My boyfriend and I really liked them. Will do again!

I found this recipe wonderful. I did lessen the mayo and added a splash of milk to thin it out. If you are ever out of bread crumbs do what I do all the time. I don't buy bread crumbs anymore. Take your blender through some loaf bread, old biscuits, etc in it and blend until it becomes fine. So much better than store bought. I had my spices and it is great.

Just made this for dinner and we all loved it. Chicken was very moist and I also cut the mayo in half. I would suggest adding more seasoning though to enhance the flavor. This was a keeper!

Followed advice of other reviewers: 1/2 c mayo, 1/2 milk, and 1/4 c ranch dressing. Used pepper, paprika, salt, garlic powder, and thyme, but didn't really measure. Also used panko and some herbed breadcrumbs since that's what I had on hand. Upped the temp to 400 and cooked 15-20 minutes on one side and 10 on the other. This was DELICIOUS! BF and I liked it heaps--super moist, good flavor, and big points for ease! Only note I'd probably give is that I used this on boneless chicken breasts and bone-in thighs (wasn't paying attention to packaging...whoops). Had a lot of trouble getting the meat off the thigh bones without destroying the coating, etc. while eating the breasts was a breeze. I'd personally recommend using this recipe on boneless cuts. Thanks!

Used ranch instead of mayo and used gluten free bread crumbs.  Turned out great, very moist with a crunchy crust.  Will be making this again!

YUMMY! I used this recipe with drumsticks and the chicken came out so moist, the breading was good and flavorful! Forget Shake N Bake, this will be my go-to "faux-fried" chicken recipe from now on!

Tried w/ mayo from kickin' turkey burger.  Halved the amont of thyme& used boneless, skinless breast halves. The seasoned mayo provided most of the flavor here.  Just kinda average to plain, I'm imagining without the SEASONED mayo.  Doubt I'll make this one again.

I am amazed by how many rave reviews this chicken has received. I promised oven fried chicken for our small group at church and chose this recipe due to the amount of good reviews. I made 10 pounds of chicken- a combo of drumsticks and thighs, and not ONE piece of chicken was servable or something I would be proud to serve. It came out soggy in places, if it even had the breading on it (most fell off). The flavor was not terrible, a bit too much thyme for my taste, but OK, but without the breading the chicken is bland. I may try this again one time for my family just to see if I can get better results, but for now I am about to stop at KFC to at least deliver something edible. Terribly disappointed with this recipe.

Excellent! Turns out a nice crispy chicken.  I used light mayo thinned out with some free ranch dressing for a little extra flavor.  I also added parmesan cheese in the crumb mixture. Everyone just loved it!

Nice flavor, moist, and best of all not as much mess as frying! Next time, I will try 1/2 c mayo + 1/2 c milk (It seemed like 1 c of mayo was a little too much.) instead or try using ranch to dip the chicken.

Absolutely the easiest to make and the tastiest to eat!  My chicken always comes out dry, not this time!  I used what I had, boneless/skinless breasts, Panko and Emeril's Essence.  Rubbed the chicken with some mayo and shook in the bag with the coating mix.  Baked at 375* as someone else recommended.  I used my broiler pan so the heat would get underneath the chicken and also turned it after 30 minutes.  We all thank-you for something so easy and so good!!!  DH said this is a keeper!  (I want to now try it w/pork chops!!!  Mine are usually leather like!!!)

Nope -- won't make this one again. Didn't like the flavor with the mayo, didn't brown on top as I would like, not enough crumb mixture to coat all the chicken -- had to mix up more. Didn't crisp up either.

Used boneless skinless breasts.  Omitted salt.  Followed another suggestion and used a ranch dressing and milk mixture in place of mayo.  Tasted good, but did not get quite as crispy as I would think to classify it as "fried."  Still worth making again.

Delicious. Great flavour and a nice, crispy texture. So easy, too! I will make this recipe again, but the only change I will make next time is to halve the garlic as it was a little too strong for my liking.

I was so skeptical of the mayonnaise thing, but it sure does work! I didn't need anywhere close to a cup though.  I just put a small amount on each piece and then rubbed around for an even coating.  I also just used a premade breadcrumb mixture from Whole Foods.  It was panko coconut curry - so delicious!!!  The chicken was juicy, flavorful, and so tender we didn't need a knife to cut through any of the pieces!

As others, I was a little concerned about the mayo, but jumped in anyway.  Used oregano instead of thyme, and xtra garlic (garlic fans).  We all loved it, will do again without a doubt.

Absolutely loved this! Everyone cleaned their plate. Ran short on breadcrumbs so I crumbled 1 cup of stuffing mix. Mixed the mayo and the milk as suggested in other reviews. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This chicken was AMAZING!!  Just made it and my family said by far the best chicken they've had in a long time.  Easy too!!  I had to make one variation b/c I didn't have enough bread crumbs.  I doubled the recipe and did 1 cup bread crumbs and 1 cup crushed French's Fried Onions.....and a little cayenne pepper to add a kick to it.  Wonderful!!!

I mixed the mayo with some ranch dressing; all I had was southwest ranch and the extra kick was awesome! I also did what another reviewer had suggested and placed a cooling rack over the baking sheet to avoid the sogginess, worked great! I used drumsticks and cooked for about 35 minutes @ 375

I made this recipe as written except I did 1/2 cup mayo mixed with 1/2 cup milk.  it was pretty darn good.  I did put it on a cooling rack in the oven to keep it crispy on the bottom.  It was super juicy.  My husband said that I should make it again.  I give it 4 stars because I could taste the thyme more than I wanted to... then again I am pregnant so it's hard to say...

This was quite good.  My kids are picky eaters and they all enjoyed this.  My son even asked for seconds (which is really rare).  I made it with boneless skinless chicken breast and it came out fine.  I will make this again.

I am not sure this really tasted like oven-fried chicken, but as baked chicken recipes go this was excellent.  It had excellent flavor and it was very moist.  I used boneless breast and baked about 35 minutes.  Perfect!

I made this last night and it was very delicious.  Even my picky husband and daughter both liked it.  It's a pretty simple and easy recipe.  The skin got very crispy and I never eat the skin but this was very tasty!  I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter since I only had about 1-1/2 pounds of chicken parts.  Turned out great, just like fried chicken.  Thank you for the recipe.  I'm already planning on making this next week.

Great as is! The chicken does truly come out of the oven crispy on the outside, and moist and delicious on the inside. Will use this recipe again.

This recipe is delicious, my husband and kids all liked it.  This is a great way to have fried chicken in a healthier way.  I followed the recipe, except for the mayonaise.  My husband hates mayo, so I dunked the chicken in milk first and then rolled in the crumb mixture.  I aslo, didn't have any bread crumbs on hand , so I used cracker crumbs instead and it worked out great.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was soooo good!!!! =) Definitely making it again. I made it using chicken wings, but next time I will use drumsticks! It came out crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of milk. I omitted the thyme because one user said it was overpowering. I baked it on 350 for 30 minutes and 375 for the remaining 15 minutes.

very good and very easy! i used mayo mixed with milk like others said. the result was nicely cooked chicken with a great coating. Last week i tried making "fried chicken" and it failed, but this created what tasted like fried chicken but so so very much easyer! (and the time and temp are VERY close to Chucks fave mac and cheese also listed on this site that i LOVE, so i put in the chicken, waited till cook times were equal and then put in the mac and cheese. a very good meal togeather, even as left overs!)

Pleasantly surprised! This taste very close to Chic-Fil-A's flavor. Maybe mayo is their secret. Anyway, I had to do a few substitutions to keep from having to make a trip to the grocery store. My bread crumbs were expired, so I figured I'd crush up some rice crispies and they would be like panko crumbs and they were! Also, I didn't have thyme so I used a poultry spice mix and that did great and also onion powder instead of the garlic. I used boneless, skinless breast and cut them into strips. My family had nothing but praises. I WILL use this recipe again! YUM!

This is the perfect recipe for our family! My son loves breaded chicken, but my granddaughter is allergic to eggs.  I just use her egg free mayo (tastes horrible plain but is super in the recipe!!) Delicious, moist chicken, no frying and everyone is happy!!

I like fried chicken with a crisp crust. Next time I will kick up the oven temp a notch or two. I should have read the reviews before I tried it. It was good and a keeper for sure.

I found this recipie and decided I wanted it for dinner but would not be home directly from work. So I sent it to my husband and he made it. It was the best chicken I think I have ever had! I had him use chicken tenders instead of chicken with bone. This will defnatly be something that is going to be cooked alot in my house!! I would next time use a little less pepper but other than that served it with fresh Corn on the cob and Mashed potatos not a crisp was left!

Wow, better than KFC original recipe, and a little better for you.  Like other reviewers I cut the mayo in half, and added a little 1/2 & 1/2 to it.  More than enough to coat 2 breasts and 4 thighs.  I added lemon pepper rather than salt and pepper, and it came out just wonderful, with a hint of lemon in the mix.

This has been the best oven fried chicken I've ever made! The mayo makes all the difference. It turned out so moist. I used boneless skinless chicken breast when I made it, as well I doubled the garlic (love garlic!) and sometime's I'll experiment with different spices from different recipes (always using the mayo), but it's great just the way it is too! I dont usually measure out and use all the mayo that the recipe calls for, just enough to coat the chicken without it being too globby.

I did add a bit of milk to the mayo and spiced it up a little (The husband always complains that things are bland.), but even he thought it was tasty and he's not a fan of chicken to begin with. We will make this again.

Very easy and delicious... I usually don't do baked boneless chicken as it gets dry but this was not.  I did take suggestion to cook at a higher temp (375) for less time. I also added some parmesan cheese to bread crumbs as I was serving it with a pasta side dish.

I thought this was great.  I too changed the mayo to 1/2 c. & 1/2 c. milk.  I also used light mayo.  Used Italian bread crumbs.  My grandsons loved it.  I usually use drumsticks & thighs and I make extra because the leftovers are really good too. It's the best oven fried chicken I've found.

I thought this was pretty good, however my husband didn't care for it, he thought it was too juicy!  I asked him "keeper or not a keeper" and he said "not". I did bake it on a rack as others have done, and it was still a little soggy on the bottom.  Oh well...

YUM! I used skinless drumsticks, put in a plastic bag with light mayo and marinated them for a couple of hours. I squeezed alot of the mayo off as I pulled them out of the bag, before coating them with the seasoned breadcrumbs. I used seasoned salt and pepper instead of plain, and added a bit of onion powder too. I put them on a parchment paper lined sheet and they came out crispy, not soggy at all like I was expecting. Chicken is crispy outside(even without the skin)and moist inside, and the best thing is NO OIL and NO MESS! Family loved these, definitely will make again! No more Shake 'N Bake for us!

WOW!  This is a great recipe!  My BF and I made this for dinner for us and his two boys, and everyone loved it.  We did remove the skin from the chicken, and you never would have known the difference.  Followed the recipe to a T and it was flawless.  The chicken stayed moist and tender, and the coating crisped up nicely.  We made a double batch recipe and finished the rest of it for lunch the next day. Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, this was great! I really worried that I would be able to taste the mayo, but no, not at all. It made the chicken SO juicy and tender. I used boneless chicken breasts as I'm not a huge fan of chicken on the bone. I baked on a rack over a baking dish and the bottom was crunchy and delicious. Thank you so much!

This chicken has a nice flavor and is very moist.  It's good and I will probably make it again but it isn't anything special.  For an easy and tasty every day dinner it's great.

Pretty good, on its own the recipe was mushy on the bottom like others suggested it would be. With the tweaks however it was much better the next time around.

Fantastic base recipe; the recipe is great as is but can be adapted to all kinds of different chicken flavors, just keep the mayo and breadcrumbs and vary the seasonings; this base makes a great oven chicken Parmesan, dip the chicken in mayo, use Italian breadcrumbs mixed w/ a couple tablespoons of Parmesan cheese to coat chicken and bake as recommended; fabulous!  With this you can really get creative. The mayo is the secret.

This is an excellent base recipe. I made quite a few changes as recommended by others.
1. I used 1 c. Fresh Gourmet Croutons - Cheese & Garlic flavour...I didn't add the teaspoon of garlic because the croutons added enough.
2. Added 1/4 tsp. poultry seasonings.
3. 1/2 tsp. pepper
4. 1/4 tsp. paprika
5. 1/2 c. mayo mixed with a little milk for easy dipping.
6. I used chicken breasts
7. Oven 400 - 25 to 30 minutes.
All the rest remained the same. Excellent!!!!!

I used chicken breasts cut into large chunks along with seasoned breadcrumbs.  I added the other spices as suggested except I didn't have paprika and I cut the pepper in half (to 1/2 tsp).  For us, it was still too much pepper, so next time I make this, I'll reduce it to 1/4 t.  Per other suggestions, I cooked chicken breasts at 400 for 20 minutes and they were just right.  I also used just 1/2 C of mayo mixed with a little milk to make it the right consistency for dipping the chicken pieces.  With these changes, the recipe is excellent.  The flavor is nice and the chicken is very moist.  My 2 year-old liked it without dip (big accomplishment).

Great chicken Elizabeth! Like others, I thinned out the mayo with milk and seasoned it. Used legs and thighs which I skinned, made my own bread crumbs and used more seasonings than called for including onion powder, cayenne and poultry seasonings. The chicken came out moist, tender and nice and crispy. Thanks so much!

mmmmm..so good.  I used drummettes.  i added ceasar dressing and milk to the mayo(used only 1/2 cup).  I also added some chili powder, tumeric and pepper.  Be careful and only coat the chicken with alittle mayo or it'll get soggy(learned the hard way the first time).  I used a combo of bread crumbs and crackers and i added the same seasonings as i did in the mayo mix.  I baked at 375 for 40 mins and the turned them and baked them for another 15 at 400.  came out crispy and moist!  i would have given it 5 stars but i think that the it should have said not to use too much mayo.  served it with mexican rice.  Absolutely delsih!

The mayo DOES make the chicken come out extremely moist and juicy!  Can add whatever spices you like.  I cooked the chicken for 25 minutes at 400 degrees as per another review (I used boneless, skinless breasts) and it came out great!

My husband is very picky when it comes to fried chicken.  When I tried this recipe, oh boy...I thought he would never stop eating. Oh my gosh! it's sooo delicious.  I would suggest using italian bread crumbs.  I followed the direction except for the cooking time (especially when I'm using drumstick).  For the first 45 minutes, I set the oven for 350 degrees, and the last 15 minutes, I raise the temperature to 375.  This recipe is very yummy!

I was skeptical, but with a few minor changes, the recipe was great!!  I used 1/2 cup mayo and added 3 tbs. dijon mustard.  For the crumbs, I used Italian breadcrumbs and added only the paprika, garlic powder and salt and pepper with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  I baked it in a 375 degree oven for 25 min. each side; both crispy and moist.  GREAT!!

I just made this for my family & they all thought that it was very good. I used garlic & herb bread crumbs and added paprika & pepper. I turned the chicken over during the last 10 minutes so it would brown on both sides. Next time I think I'll
cook it on a broiler pan so the grease can drain.

This is definitely a "set it and forget it" recipe!  The taste is excellent: it's suited for elegant dinners or casual potlucks.  The meat is moist, and the cooking time doesn't even take 45 minutes.  I made this recipe using three halved breasts with the bone still in, and believe that you can use other kinds of cuts to obtain yummy results.

Loved it!!! Used mayo, miracle whip, a big squeeze of buttermilk ranch & milk. As per other reviewers, I did half C of each mayo/miracle whip. For dry I used Ritz, Italian bread crumbs, dry mashed potato flakes (trust me, they're key), garlic powder, paprika, a smidge of red pepper flakes, pepper, dry onions, salt free seasoning from Dollar Tree(best kept secret!!!), dash of rosemary. I did make extra dry mix. Needed it for 4-5 large breasts split into 2's. Wet in bowl, dry in Ziploc. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts. Baked on racks set on large cookie sheet @ 400° for 20, flipped, baked another 20, increased temp to 425° & baked another 20 minutes. PURRFECT! Moist, crunchy outside, flavor was amazing! Served with Idahoan 4 cheese instant mashed, YUM & green beans with bacon/onion! Doubt I'll ever stand for hours frying again. It's that good. Thanks so much for the recipe & reviews. Wow, on rotation now.

The breading was good (I cut the thyme a lot), it stuck to the chicken very well, but it was not crispy and didn't remind me at all of normal fried chicken. The breading texture came out like microwave chicken nuggets. I think the cooking method is to blame, and would try the breading mix again but change the oven temp.

After all the rave reviews, I decided to give this a try. I loved the taste the mayonnaise added to this. I thought that the chicken was very tender and juicy, but for some reason, it wasn't very crispy, that's why I only gave it 3 stars. My usual way of breading the chicken first in butter and then in a panko-cheese mixture gives a much crispier coating. I think maybe the temperature was too low at 375 degrees, I usually roast chicken at 425 degrees. The taste was good enough for me to try this again, this time at the higher roasting temperature, which hopefully will give me the nice crisp I was hoping for.

Excellent, the only thing I did that it didn't suggest was to turn it over half way through cooking so the top side would brown!!!!!  Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I myself did not like this chicken. however my three year enjoyed it and my husband enjoyed it as well. I wasn't exactly a fan of the texture of the skin. wasn't crunchy enough for me.

I made this recipe using all the spices called for.  The only change I made was to mix them in with the mayo instead of the bread crumbs. This way flavors the meat instead of just the breading. The spices just soak into the chicken making it so flavorful! Oh, and I did cook at 375 for the first 45,minutes then at 400,for an additional 15. Fantastic!

This is a great recipe!!! I also changed it up like Cheryl Bobbs did. I mixed half mayo and half milk before adding the chicken to the bread crumbs. It came out delicious. :) My family loved it!!!

I would compare this to putting Mayo on French fries, not a good idea and I did not care for the taste.

Mayo is "sticky" and maybe that's why it was chosen to hold the crumbs.  Then I thought, what else is sticky?  Minced garlic surely is!  So if less or no mayo is desired then the garlic and ?? could be used.  Oil is slippery, milk not so much either way.

Good, chicken was moist. Coating was a little gritty, maybe my breads were at fault. Will make again.

My guys absolutely LOVED this recipe!  The only changes I made were:  I baked it for 45 minutes on 365 as I have a gas stove and I always seem to need to go a little higher than 350.  Also, I cut down on the thyme just a little.  The chicken was extremely moist and very, very tasty.  The bottom was just a little soggy as this dish creates some grease, but other than that, it was great!  Maybe next time I'll use tinfoil.

Definitely a keeper. If you're really fat-conscious, use low fat mayo. It still keeps the chicken moist and the coating crisp! I also think baking the chicken on an oiled rack would guarantee it's crispiness. Some of my pieces were a bit soggy on the bottom.

DELISH, I had one 4 1/2lb whole chicken and cut up, I did not use thyme at all, I used all others and a little of chicken spice in my bread crumbs, but I seasoned my chicken first after I cut it up with that California garlic salt, but not much and let it sit. Then I took a little less  then a cup of lite mayo, Oh I did take off the skin on the chicken except for the wings. I took the mayo and put in bowl with the chicken and rubbed it on the chicken, but not much, just to coat, then I did use a bowl for bread crumbs, not a zip lock bag, and pressed down on both sides, I did use the progresso Italian crumbs, then layered it in the pan, skin side down, but no skin of course. I baked 350 for 20 min, and looked under, but was not brown enough so I put to 400 and did about 10 min then turned and then I did for about another 20 min, cause my chicken was larger then the recipe calls for. I took out and let sit for a few minutes. VERY VERY moist and DELISH. I'm sorry, but I don't like thyme, to over powering for me. So try it, you will love it. I thank your all recipes for all your good recipes you have. This was DELISH, and I have been cooking for 50yrs. Thank you again.

I made this last night for the first time.  My husband, who doesn't care for chicken, loved it.  He raved about it to the neighbor.  It was awesome.  As with other reviewers, I made my own personal changes, but I could tell that even without substitutions it would have been great!

I have to say I was a little skeptical as I've tried other oven baked chicken recipes before and was disappointed, until last night.  This one tasted like fried chicken - I was happily surprised.   My family said this one's a keeper for the recipe file.  Definitely will be making this again.   

I did read the reviews first, so I too halved the mayo and used a 1/2 cup milk and whisked that together.  I also doubled the breading mixture and I'm glad I did.  One cup would not have been enough for a whole cut up chicken.  I also put my chicken on a wire rack on a baking sheet and baked it at 400 for about 20-25 minutes on each side, flipping half way through.  It was very moist and very good, went well with the mashed potatoes and the gravy.

OK, I tried this recipe because of all the positive reviews. Left the skin on the chicken, and hand rubbed the mayo on, then dipped. Used it exactly how it was posted. But the skin and coating because a mushy mess. It didn't harden up or make a crust. Maybe you should put that it must not sit in the greased pan, maybe it should be raised on a rack. Oh well. I have gotten many recipes on this site, and this is the first that didn't come out well. Live and learn. No, I didn't tweak the recipe at all. Just hand rubbed the mayo so it wasn't as thick and gloppy.

Wow! I made this recipe to spec, except the seasonings. I did add the salt, garlic powder, and paprika, but I also added onion powder and black pepper. I should have measured it, but I eyeballed it instead, it was a little too much garlic, but we gobbled it up anyways. I also use Japanese bread crumbs or Panko Flakes when I make recipes of this nature, which I love because it gives the food a little more crunch and flavor.  The mayonnaise' oils that are produced while baking give the chicken its wonderful moistness, especially when baking the white meat part of the chicken, "breasts".  So juicy, tender, crunchy on the outside. Thank you so much for this wonderful take on "fried chicken' without the frying pan and a ton of oil.  Delicious!!!!! Served with white rice, green beans and a tossed salad.  mmmmm

Finally reviewing recipe. Excellent flavor, the only change I made was to use smoked paprika but don't imagine it would taste too different with other types of paprika. Thank you for submitting recipe.

Super recipe!  I made this with boneless chicken breasts and it was fabulous!  I made sure that the pieces I used were all about the same thickness, which meant halving a couple of breasts lengthwise.  The mayo coating was not too thick at all and since I only had Italian bread crumbs on hand I used those with Italian seasoning added.  I baked this for 40 minutes, turning after 20.

Moist, but the seasonings were much too much for this dish. Cut back on thyme and salt...very very spicy and that comes from someone who loves spice...however, the kids couldn't eat it.

Yum! I mixed mayo with some soy milk so it wasn't so thick. It was a bit spicy for us, so next time I would only use 1/2 tsp or less of pepper. Thanks!

this recipe was great!! i did take the advice of a review i only used half the amount of mayo and mixed it with half a cup of whole milk. and i used italian break crumbs for added flavor. my boyfriend always uses bbq sauce for dipping for his chicken. this was the first time he was ever mad he did! he said that the chicken had so much flavor that the bbq sauce messed it up! i was in shock lol very good recipe deff saving for another day.

This was a total flop for me.  Not enough crumbs to cover 3lbs, tons of leftover mayo.  The breading was crispy, but the skin under was totally soft.  I'm going to keep looking.

Very good. Easy (but a little messy with the mayo). I cut up 2 chickens for lunch leftovers and used two pans in the oven. Came out perfect. Much better than shake n bake out of a box. Very juicy and tasty.

This was easy and very good.  I used thighs with the skin removed, and with this coating they were extremely juicy and tender with great flavor.  The coating didn't get golden brown like I expected, and I had to broil them for a few minutes to get the crispy factor going - which is why I selected this recipe.  Maybe I did something wrong, but followed the recipe exactly.  I will make this again.

Tried this tonight and it was delicious! Made it per the recipe, except I used panko bread crumbs, and omitted the paprika because I was out. Was a bit leery about all that mayo, but it came out crunchy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. 
The only problem was the cooking temp/time... 45 minutes at 350 just wasn't enough to brown these up nicely. I ended up cranking it up to 400 and leaving it for an hour. Wonderful "fried chicken" flavor without all the frying mess!! Definitely a keeper.

This chicken was great ! I will make this again for sure.. I added ranch dressing to the mayo which was excellent, I also added parm cheese to the breading and topped it on the chicken before putting in the oven.. and used boneless Chicken Cutlet instead of bigger bone in pieces of chicken, I highly recommend this !!

This was just OK.  Even after adding extra garlic powder, a little Old Bay and ranch dressing, it came out pretty bland.

5 star recipe.  My 12 yr old chicken nugget loving son ate 4 pieces of real chicken!  I used drumsticks and baked a little longer for extra crunchiness. Definitely adding to my weekly dinner list. :)

Great comfort food.  I made as written except diluted mayo-1/2 cup mayo, a bit of ranch and a couple splashes skim.  Yummy.  Only issue...hubby  likes a bit crispier.

I liked the idea of this, but the coating wasn't crispy at all. I even took others advice of using Panko. The mayo DID keep the chicken moist. Next time I crave fried chicken, I'll get KFC. But at least it was a heathier alternative!

GREAT recipe! I didn't change much, except I did not have thyme or paprika on hand. I used onion powder/garlic powder/salt and pepper and sprinkled a little parm cheese on top. It came out juicy and wonderful! To reheat leftovers, recommend putting back in the oven to crisp up.

I used boneless chicken breasts and they came out really moist with a crispy crust. I used panko crumbs like other reviewers suggested. Next time I will use less thyme and 1/2 tsp more salt. Overall a good recipe!

I made this recipe with a few changes. I used boneless skinless breasts, used a half cup mayo whisked with a half cup milk, and added onion powder to the breading. I also had to bake them longer than the recommended time, probably closer to an hour and fifteen minutes. They turned out great and I will be making them again!

Used grated Parm as part of the seasoning, and Panko breading instead of bread crumbs and only half of the mayo..VERY yummy and crispy. Although I'd definitely put chicken on greased wire rack over a cookie sheet to prevent any pieces sticking on the cookie sheet :(

THink I will use Italian bred crumbs next time and go easy on the Mayo.  I did not care for the thyme taste to this......just my personal preference.  Easy / quick, will make again, but not outstanding in my opinion.

Delicious - I also cut the mayo in half and used milk (but I wonder if this is why my coating didn't stick so well?). I would have liked the spices to come out more but my bread crumbs were homemade and not fine enough so that's likely why the issues. I also put the chicken on a baking rack over a cookie sheet (lined in wax paper for easy clean up). Chicken was tender and juicy.

made it this morning with some alterations:  - used bone-in chicken thighs - made slits into the thighs and seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper (i like it spicy) - drizzled a little olive oil over the thighs - dipped chicken in buttermilk (not mayo) - used seasoned breadcrumbs with 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder - baked chicken in a baking pan with a cooling rack  turned out great.  thanks for the base recipe to build off of.

After reading many reviews, I made three changes to the recipe.  First, I used skinless thinned chicken breasts.  Second, I used panko breading instead of bread crumbs.  And third, instead of the thyme and garlic powder I used "McCormick Perfect Pinch: Savory All-Purpose" seasoning (chili pepper, thyme, oregano, rosemary, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, paprika, garlic, onion, orange and lemon peel).   After reading reviews, I used a broiler pan for baking and turned the chicken halfway through the cook time.  The chicken was flavorful and the breading was crisp.  However, the chicken was not as moist as I hoped.  The mayonnaise did not seem to affect the flavor one way or another.  Although my husband said he would eat this dish again, he stated that he was in no hurry for a repeat.

My husband said this was "fantastic," and fried chicken is one of his all-time favorites.  I thought it was outstanding:  juicy, tasty, and just plain good!  I used saltines, as that was all I had.  I also substituted chili powder for the sage, as my husband is not a fan of sage.  I also ended up cooking it an hr, but I had 3 large bone-in chicken breasts.  Thank you so much!  This will become a staple recipe in our house!!

Other than cooking at 375 for an hour and using legs/thighs, I followed the recipe exactly. Good flavor and the meat is very juicy, but all 4 of my kids disliked the "gritty" texture of the bread crumbs. I'm not sure if I did something wrong to make them not soften up?

Delicious!  I did substitute oregano for the thyme (because I didn't have thyme), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it is amazing.  My husband and children (ages 4 and 2) loved this recipe!

My husband loved this chicken!  It's easy and fast to make and so flavorful and moist.  I had a boo-boo foot and couldn't stand, so I cheated on the recipe.  I used Italian bread crumbs so I wouldn't have to measure out anything.  I used chicken thighs and baked at 375 for an hour.  Perfect

Good, quick and easy. I, like other posters, diluted the mayo with some milk. I also added a dash of hot sauce to the mix.

I'm surprised. This is really good. I used chicken thighs and placed them on a cooling rack. Will definitely make this again. Used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of milk, rest of ingredients stayed the same. Cooked for 45 minutes at 375 degrees. Next time I make this, I will use less thyme- just a tad overpowering.

This was edible and that is all! Too dry! It was almost sand like! Not crunchy or flavorful at all!

I used Panko breadcrumbs and large boneless/skinless chicken breasts cut into strips and then pounded out the chicken slightly. I made a full recipe for the breadcrumbs and had to 1/2 the recipe and make more to cover all the strips.  Absolutely delicious and my family enjoyed it thoroughly.  We will be making this recipe again and again.

A slight modification was required since I had no bread crumbs I opted to use cornmeal and not enough mayo on hand so I used T Marzetti Classic Ranch.   I cooked it at the recommended temp for a while longer too.  Chicken came out moist, tender and full of flavor.  Yum. Will make again, especially when I want something quick and easy for a crowd.

Great meal! Changes I made: I used crushed tortilla chips and bread crumbs for my coating. I also used 1/2 c. Mayo/2 tbsp Ranch Dressing/a splash of milk. I added Italian seasoning to the mix too. I basically mixed those ingredients until it looked like the right consistency. I cooked it at 425 for 25 minutes. I did as others suggested and cooked it on a cooling rack. I didn't have to flip them throughout the cooking time.

I was skeptical at first, but this really was a great oven fried chicken!  Definately going to be adding to my recipe book for those nights i don't feel like pan frying.  I did flour the chicken before dipping in mayo to help the mixture stick.  I cheated some too, i used seasoned breadcrumbs with a little bit of Lawry's seasoned salt instead of all the seasonings, and thinned out the mayo just a little with some milk.  I also used chicken breasts cut into strips and placed on aluminum foil greased with non-stick spray for easy clean up.  My husband hates mayo and thought these were great!

My picky husband really likes this! It was a nice quick and simple dinner. I used Ranch instead of mayo, and I used skinless breasts. I'll definitely make this again, but next time I make it I'll cut it into smaller, nugget sized pieces, as that seems to be the best for this particular recipe.

Meat has soooo favorful and juicey!!! Per others suggestions, I halved the mayo, and thinned it with a little milk.  I think next time I make this chicken I will use cookie rack to bake it on, as one reviewer mentioned.  The chicken won't be moist on the bottom that way.  Great tip!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

Just tried this and it was a hit. I followed other reviewers tips re:baking rack in the cookie sheet and thinned the mayo a tad. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs, and kicked up the garlic. My grand-daughter loved them.

This was great, fast and easy. Tasted moist with a crunchy coating. The only thing that I changed as one person stated was to use 1/2 cup of mayo.  The best part was not stinging up the kitchen had I fryed the chicken and getting my wife mad.

This breading is VERY forgiving, we turned old garlic bread into bread crumbs and added some cayenne as we felt necessary.  We used a 1:1 ratio of mayo:milk.  It turned out great.  The oven rack kept it crispy on the bottom.  We'll be sure to use this recipe again.  Thanks!

My family did not care for this at all. The chicken was not crispy. The mayo was overpowering and also made it very messy to prepare. Leftover "fried" chicken never lasts long in my house, but this time I wound up rinsing the coating off the leftover pieces and cutting up the meat for another recipe. Perhaps I did something wrong, or it's just my family's "druthers", but with all the oven fried recipes out there, I will probably not attempt to adapt this one in order to serve it again.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed what other users reccomended and put half a cup of mayo mixed with half a cup of milk. It was so moist, and delicious. I also added some cayenne pepper and used actual bread crumbs, not store bought. Was so delicious I want to make it again tonight!! Whole family raved!!

It was fine but not the greatest.  We found the spices a little too overpowering for us.  I have other Oven Fried Chicken recipes I would use before this one.

This was good, but I was disappointed. I also ended up with soggy bottoms. I followed advice of other reviewers: used half panko, half breadcrumbs; brushed on mayo with a pastry brush; mixed different spices for a kick; baked for 40 minutes at 350 and then another 10 minutes at 425. I would probably make it again because I love this type of chicken but my bf said it was just kind of 'blah.'

I've made this twice. The first time, I didn't have thyme, so I omitted it. It was delicious and the family was very impressed! The second time, I followed the recipe using 1 tsp of thyme and the thyme taste was too strong for us. Next time I will either half it or not use it at all. Overall, a great recipe though.

I did take off the skin.  I used less mayo and added milk and let the chicken sit in the fridge till time to cook.  Very good - moist and yummy.  Oh, I used ritz crackers because I had them.  I don't think you could hurt this recipe!

This is an excellent chicken dish.  I added extra thyme and paprika and it turned out great.  Instead of cutting up chicken in pieces, I simply used chicken breasts. Since I like my food spicy, may I suggest that we add 1/2 teaspoon of either cayenne or chili to the mix but this spice mixture is perfect as it is.  I served this great dish with 'Mexican rice II' and a side-dish of yellow, orange and red peppers in an Asian sauce and as recommended, a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  What a great combination!

This recipe was awesome.  I had just bought 2 packs of 5 chicken legs bc they were on sale and needed to do something with them.  I found this recipe and loved it.  Both my kids (6 and 1) ate it up and hubby said I need to make it more often.  Thanks, this one is a definite keeper.  After the chicken was done cooking at 350 for 45 minutes I increased the temp to 375 and baked for another 15 minutes and the skin was super crispy and delicious.

I made it according to the recipe with the exception that I added milk to the mayonnaise. My wife and I loved it. It certainly is a healthy alternate to Southern Fried Chicken, and is just as tasty.

My family loved this!  I used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 heavy cream.  The second time I made it I put a pat of butter on top of each chicken piece before placing in the oven.  This is a very good oven fried chicken recipe and now part of my collection.

This turned out perfect! used drumsticks for taking on a picnic and they all look fantastic and taste even beter! Did use one of the suggestions to lighten the mayo with a little milk, and that was very helpful.

Very good recipe. I dipped my chicken in flour first then into the mayo which I added milk to. I used a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs, parm. cheese and season salt. Baked in a 375 oven. We really enjoyed our meal!

Very good chicken and easy to prepare. I had a large pack of chicken legs that I used. To cut down on the fat I took the skin off and as much fat as I could. I used Italian bread crumbs and there is no need to use 1 cup of mayo - 1/4 to 1/2 cup is enough. Chicken came out so moist and tender! Leftovers made into sandwiches were delicious. Will be sure to make this again!

These were great! We cut boneless skinless chicken breasts up into "nugget" sized pieces. Perfect!

OMG!  So good and easy, plus all the ingredients (minus chicken) are things I always have on hand anyway.  I used chicken breasts and flattened them out.  I diluted the mayo just a slight bit, as others have done.  I baked the breasts at 400 for 40 minutes and they were perfect.  My husband and I were both really impressed with this recipe.  And it's hard to impress him!

Excellent flavor! Made a few changes...used less thyme, added chili flakes and cooked chicken on wire racks at 350 for 40 mins, 425 for 10 mins flipping half way.

Great recipe,but made a few adjustments... I followed other reviews- cooked at 375 degrees F for 45 min and flipped over and cooked for additional 10 min. The chicken turned out crispy, not soggy at all. Also I marinaded the chicken in the mayo and spicy chili sauce, for added flavor. I added 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of mashed croutons to the 1/2 cup of bread crumb mixture. Also another review mentioned to grease the bottom and spray the top of the coated chicken with cooking spray- this helped the chicken stay crispy.

I tried this except I always use skinless chicken breasts and I decided to pan fry instead of baked.  I guess I'm not a big fan of Thyme as I wasn't too crazy about this the first time I made it.  The second time, I eliminated the Thyme, added a some Cayenne and used Miracle Whip instead of Mayonnaise.  The second batch was way tastier.

Loved it!!  My whole family loved it including children under the age of 8!! All I can say is....FOIL, FOIL, FOIL - for easy cleanup!  I used the cooling tray on a baking sheet with foil and it was super easy to clean!  Important for me with 4 kids.   The only things I changed were I used Miracle Whip - all I had - and no thyme - didn't need it, but will try when I get it.  Also, I took another's advice and after 40 mins of cooking at 350, I put it at 425 for 10 mins to crisp and flipped 1/2way.   Perfect and not slimy!  You have to try it!

Tasted alot like the other bread, and baked chicken. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. For 2 breasts, I only needed 1/3 of a cup of mayo. I did as others suggested and baked the chicken in a 375 degree oven. It did stay a little mushy on top, but not enough to complain about. The rest was crunchy and good. We only had two small pieces as leftovers.(They were good the second day, cold.) The flavor wasn't bad, it just needed a dipping sauce. I served Ginger Sauce out of a jar.

I didn't change a thing to this recipe, and it was fantastic!

I had 4 large boneless, skinless breasts...I only needed less than 1/2 cup  mayo.  Instead of doing a shake and bake kind of thing, I just brushed the breasts with mayo and then sprinkled with the crumbs and spices on the chicken already in the pan....turned out moist and delicious with a crunchy coating (I sprayed with cooking spray before baking).

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!!

Yummy!!! The idea of using a cooling rack was sheer genious! I didn't  have one so I just put the chicken directly on my oven rack and placed a cookie sheet underneath. Nice and crispy on all sides! Instead of mayo I marinated my chicken in french onion dip which gave it a really nice flavor. I didn't bother with the thyme My family gobbled it up and only left me one piece! I guess I'll have to make it again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I added Ranch dressing, like some people said, to a smaller amount of mayo; which made it great! I even placed the chicken up on a cookie cooling rack so the bottom wouldn't be mushy. Well, that didn't work! Of course, it could be because I had to add a tiny bit of water to the glass baking dish I had the cookie cooling rack in because it was starting to smoke (and no, the water was no where near the chicken - I was thinking the steam made the bottom mushy). I gave this 4 stars because, although I will make this again, I use 5 stars only for blow-my-mind recipes.

Cripsy, moist, and delicious! I didn't have thyme or paprika, but this still tasted wonderful. My family loved it. I cooked thighs placed on a cooling rack on a baking sheet... I still got soggy bottoms, but that didn't take away from our enjoyment at all. I'm so excited to find a chicken recipe that's this simple and so tasty!

I always get nervous at the notion of frying anything.  There was an incident that I won't go into back in junior high home ec class that involved a pan of peanut oil on high heat that gives me the jitters around boiling oil.  Fortunately, this recipe was painless, not to mention tasty too.  I did add a lot more cayenne pepper, and I used some Kosher salt in the seasoning, but that was mainly due to personal taste.  The coating wanted to fall off as soon as I took it out of the oven, but I suspect that was more of a personal failing on my part.  Besides, there were certainly no complaints regardless;  the chicken was exceptionally moist and tender, and, surprisingly, not greasy at all.  A great treat any night of the week.  (Just make sure it's not EVERY night.)

Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  It was great to have that fried chicken taste without the frying.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I crumbled up crackers instead.  It made it nice and crispy.  The mayo also made the chicken moist. Thanks for a great recipe!  I'll be using it again soon!

I also used 1/2 cup mayo,1/2 cup milk(I only had 1%),crushed ritz crackers as I was out of bread crumbs and the same seasonings as the recipe states. ONLY, as I was adding the paprika, I realized I added HOT paprika by mistake. So, I removed as much of it as I could and added the regular paprika. Apparantly some of the hot stayed with the breading because you could taste a tiny bit of a kick with the chicken. It was incredibly moist and delicious. My extremely picky 5 year old ate every bit and I also enjoyed it.

I saw this recipe last night and changed it all up.  Was thinking about time.  I used breadcrumbs, Mrs. Dash Chipolte Seasoning (instead of all the spices), and Maries Jalapeno Ranch instead of the mayo.....My Husband and son loved this dish.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This turned out pretty yummy.  Next time I'm using boneless, skinless & it'll be super.  I really like the idea of NO SPLATTERING OIL & GREASE, no burns on my arms!  And no worrying if the drumsticks are done!  This is a keeper.  Try it out!  One quick Idea is to use a big zip bag for the mayo, too, then, no mess!  Great with a side of Broccoli & Cheese & baked potato, although that's a heavy meal!  Good for company, ours loved it! (I added more spices like parsley, more pepper, & thyme galore!)

This recipe was not a "keeper" for my family.  The skin was not crispy at all. The breading did have a good flavor using italian bread crumbs. Also - the chicken was moist.  We just weren't impressed by this one due to the lack of crispness.

The mayo is the key to keeping the chicken moist.  I've used both skinned and skin-on chicken, and it works every time.  I use less mayo than called for + mix in a bit of dijon mustard or jalepeno mustard at times to kick up the flavor a notch. I use flavored bread crumbs, adding a bit more herbs (think I used my standard oregano, basil, thyme combo.). I leave out the paprika, because for my taste it doesn't really belong (personal preferances and all that). The ziplock idea is helpful, thanks to another user.  Talk about homemade shake + bake with some oomph to it!!!

Uhmmmm Uhmmm good.  This is easy and turns out moist every time.  I made the following changes:  Skinned the chicken, dipped it in flour first, used a 1/2 cup mayo and a 1/2 cup sour cream and thinned the mayo mixture with milk to make it into a thick milk wash.  I also added 1/4 - 1/2 teas. cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs mixture to give it a little kick.  My family, young and old :) love this recipe.

Very easy to prepare, less then 5 minutes, and the oven did the rest. We enjoyed this recipe and will make again. I used (2) large boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The chicken was very good but a bit dry, could be my oven. Next time I will reduce the cooking time (for 2 pieces) to 35 or 40 minutes. I used 1/4 cup of mayo and cut the other ingredients by half. I agree with one of the other reviews, it could be a little spicer, so next time I will add some additional spices to suit our taste. I baked the chicken on a cookie sheet, lined with aluminum foil that was sprayed with oilve oil and clean up was a snap too. Thanks Elizabeth!

very very good I used chicken breasts and seasoned bread crumbs.  I did not use thyme.  Whole family enjoyed it and wants me to make again.
I just put all dry ingredients in a zip-lock and shaked it like a polaroid picture :)

I LOVED this recipe! The flavor was wonderful! I made one small change-I was out of thyme, so I used 1 half t basil. I liked it so much I don't think I'll try the other way. This is also SUPER EASY. What a combo. TASTY+EASY=*****

This was so easy and delicious!  It tastes vaguely like shake and bake (which I hate), but is much, much better.  The best result was that the chicken remained incredibly moist.  I used only thighs and legs to cater to my husband, but next time will try breasts, too, since the meat stayed so juicy.

This works for us!  I do like a recipe that doesn't use 400+ temperatures that tend to result in grease covered oven walls and an oven cleaning the next day!  I used Panko which resulted in a nicely crunchy covering.  I'll probably make this one of my go to recipes.

The chicken was delicious and moist. Definitely a keeper. I used Italian seasoning instead of thyme and used half the amount and mayo and thinned it with a bit of milk (Got the tip from the other reviews)

I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts cut into strips, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. (It was done in about 30 minutes; I put it on a baking sheet with parchment paper.) We loved this! The seasonings were perfect, just a bit spicy, and the chicken was moist and tasty. I served it with a ranch dipping sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Made a very moist and tender chicken, but we didn't like the taste. Also cooked at 400 20 minutes on each side with rack on baking sheet.

After reading other reviews, I used half the mayonnaise called for and mixed it with 1/2 cup of skim milk. I had Italian bread crumbs on hand, so I used those and substituted oregano and basil (1/2 tsp each) for the thyme, then threw in about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  The next time I make it, I will cut the salt in half. My 6 yr. old grandson said it was the "best chicken ever!"

Delish!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and mixed the mayo with milk, did half Italian bread crumbs and half panko crumbs, instead of thyme I put in some rosemary.  SOOOOOO good.

I, like other reviewers didn't care for the sound of gloopy mayo, so I marinated the chicken in one of my favorite marinades (I have several), dipped in the spiced bread crumbs.  The marinade is enough to make the crumbs stick.  Otherwise, no changes.  Thumbs up!

I had serious doubts about a crispy baked chicken, but thought I'd give this a try. I made this using Panko, because it's what I had on hand. I also added some Old Bay as another reviewer suggested, and omitted the thyme because I don't care for it. I used 6 boneless, skinless thighs. I also increased the temp to 375 degrees using the convection bake mode, hoping to improve the bake time. Seems I still baked it close to an hour, but it was worth the wait! Flavorful, moist, and oh so crispy! I'll definately make this again, but next time, I'll line the cookie sheet with tin foil to reduce the clean up! ;-)

This was awesome!  I did do my own twist.  I followed what other reviewer had said about the oven temp being higher and I hiked mine to 450.  I also used 1/2 mayo w/olive oil and 1%milk to make a cup.  I added some dry ranch dressing to this mixture.  I used panko crumbs, chia seeds and flaxseed.  Salted and peppered the chicken, then wet mixture, then crumbs.  I baked it 20 mins on one side on a rack, turned it over and baked it another 25 mins.  I was very moist and had great flavor!

Love the spices in this. I used Italian bread crumbs because its what i had and everyone loves it. My only problem is my crust sticking in spots. That's not so much a recipe flaw but user error! Thanks for sharing!

I made this with split chicken breasts last night, it was delicious. I added a bit of red cayenne pepper to spice it up. I only had panko bread crumbs on hand, so I used them...nice and crispy! I have a friend who uses melted butter/egg mix instead of mayo, so I may try that next time. I almost always brine my chicken before cooking, it really seems to make it taste better! Simple and easy, thanks!

Pretty good! I think next time I'd add more seasoning. I used the other peoples advice and thinned out the mayo with a little milk and cooked on a cooling rack. I also didn't have bread crumbs, so I mashed up some soda crackers and coated with that instead. Will make again...tonight actually!

Great idea.  Made some changes though - I used about 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, about 1 tbsp seasoned salt, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 mix with panko bread crumbs and normal bread crumbs.  Although messy, I used my hands to coat the chicken with the mayo.  It is the only way to get it evenly and thinly coated.  I baked at 325 in convection oven and it turned out great!  Not greasy at all and the mayonnaise flavor almost completely disappears.  Honestly, real mayo works best because of the oil content.

I made a few changes simply because these are the items I had. Used reduced fat mayo and fat free sour cream as my base. For the chicken, I had boneless, skinless thighs. This turned out perfect. Not greasy or oily.

I made this for the superbowl using 20 chicken legs. I dipped in oil instead of mayo (preference) otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They were very tender and tasty, good feedback.  Super easy to put together and bake an hour before the big game and keep warm.

I tried this recipe on Sunday, my hubby wanted fried chicken, and I wanted something without all the fat, when he saw me put it in the oven he said I thought you were frying the chicken and I answered yes in the oven. He was skeptical but when he tasted it, he told me I have to make for him all the time. I used chicken breat with bone in and seasoned it with herbs and worchestire sauch then added two tblsp of ranch dressing to marinate. I also seasoned the breadcrumbs with the same herbs I used on the chicken. I also only used half the mayo and added 1/2 cup of fatfree skim milk to it. Delicious.

Very tasty & moist chicken - can cut back on the amount of mayo.  Only reccommendation is to use a rack if you leave the skin on, otherwise it's ok to go directly into a backing dish

This was a great recipe and I loved it until I happened to glance down at the calorie, fat, and sodium content as written which kind of spoiled it for me!  I would make it again, just alter some of the ingredients so it didn't have quite so much of those three things.

Made this several time and always a hit. Although I would recommend baking this on a wire rack so as to ensure crispy skin all over!

This is a healthy way of cooking a delicious fried chicken. Everyone at home really enjoyed the food. The only thing I added to the recipe was the preparing method of the kitchen before coating it in bread crumb mixture. I placed the chicken pieces in a mixture of lemon juice, black pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder for 30 minutes. I also replace the mayonnaise with full scrambled egg. And finally the delicious chicken is ready :)

I highly recommend taking off the skin. It came out gooey and not crispy at all. I even used the panko bread crumbs. Very similar to the texture of "shake n bake" chicken. There's nothing like real fried chicken

Sorry....   No thank you!   I admit I did make two changes.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut the mayo with a little buttermilk.  I do use paprika and thyme in other recipes, but for my family, this was a bit overpowering (spicy).I personally will go back to the buttermilk bath & flour then FRY my chicken in a cast iron skillet.  Best Wishes!

I tried this recipe today.  the crust came out pretty good but the recipe calls for too much salt.  all I tasted was salt.  I would cut it in half or leave it out all together and add a teaspoon of Italian Herbs mix.

This a great recipe.You can play with the spices,I added cumin once and rosemary it was fabulous.This version was great as it is lactose free.The only tip I can give is that I covered the baking tray with foil to keep the parts moist for 3/4 of the baking time and then uncovered the chicken for the rest of the time to crisp it.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made it using light mayo and it worked just fine.  One suggestion, depending on how many pieces you are going to prepare, do not try to coat more than 3 pieces at a time.  Also, use a good zip lock bag and tumble/shake them fairly gently. Believe me, you will LIKE this chicken.

Success!  I have a terrible history with oven fried (and pan fried) chicken.  This turned out perfect.  I followed other peoples' advice and mixed the mayo with milk and also baked it on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet.  I crushed up some dry stuffing mix and added it to the bread crumbs for a little extra seasoning.  It was a hit with the whole fanily (including my pickiest eater).  I will use this recipe again and again!

AWESOMENESSSSSS!!!!! This recipe is simply amazing!!! and it has become an all time favorite in my house! We never eat fried chicken now, only oven fried. And Boy O Boy its such a pleasure! No mess! No stress! I learned not to use as much mayo as the recipe calls for, I only put about 2-3 tbs of mayo in a bowl, when coating my chicken breast. Also i dont substitute with miracle whip or anything else  because to me it taste different. But other than that it's always a delight for my family than I. So happy to have found this recipe.

GREAT! I mixed 1/2 cup mayo w/ a splash of milk, and a splash of Ranch. I mixed Panko w/ reg bread crumbs, next time all Panko. The spices sink to the bottom so use a shake/bake bag, not a bowl. One cook mentioned baking on a baker's rack to eliminate soggy crumbs (next time yes). Bake at 400, 20 min per side. Keeper!

Flavor was good, but it didn't have the crispiness that I was hoping for. I may try it again with a higher oven temperature for the first 10 minutes and then drop it down for the rest of the time.

Ehhh.  It was not bad, but not really terrific either.  Giving chicken a bath in mayo was more than a little disconcerting, but I had high hopes that it would be delish.  I used Panko bread crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe.  I like the commercially prepared box options much better.

This was delicious and my kids kept asking for more. I used 1/2 cornflake crumbs and italian bread crumbs. Dipped in hidden valley ranch dressing to give it some extra flavor. It's a keeper!! Thanks for posting.

Can anyone tell me if this comes out better without the skin? While I liked the blend of seasonings, I did not like how the mayo worked or did not work in this case.

LOVED IT!! I used 6 chicken legs and 2 tbsp miracle whip mixed with 3tbsp of bottled ranch dressing. I brushed the miracle whip-ranch sauce mixture on to the chicken legs. Then I seasoned the plain breadcrumbs with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, paprika  and black pepper. I placed seasoned breadcrumbs into a plastic bag and added one chicken leg at a time to coat. I baked chicken about 30 minutes on one side and turned it over and baked 30 minutes more. **The pan that you make these in should be dry not wet. An example, if you rinsed out your pan moments before baking this dish, the chicken might get soggy on the bottom. Also use cooking spray instead of oil in the pan. ** This recipe made a very flavorful, crispy oven fried chicken. I am making this recipe again tomorrow using 12 chicken legs. YUM!!

This was a pretty good recipe, very easy to prepare.  My only complaint is that the chicken never got crispy.  I ended up having to put the chicken back in the oven at 450 for 5 minutes or so to get it to crisp up a bit, but it was still overall soft.  The flavor was good and tasted like fried chicken, though one of my guests thought it was a tad spicy.

This was really easy and really good! A cheaper dish to make when you find the chicken on sale, too. Looks impressive. Perfect blend of seasonings (I was worried there would be too much pepper). The breast pieces were huge so baked those a little longer. Must drain on paper towels after baking. Only used about 1/2 c of mayo, spread it on with a knife and then rolled the chicken in seasonings in a med bowl. Worked great. One chicken (was about 5 lbs) needed a 9x13 pan plus an 11x7 pan.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  I too used Miracle Whip and thinned it out with milk.  I always use turkey stuffing mix (Stove Top or something similar) that I grind up in a food processor for bread crumbs.  This eliminates the need to add spices to the bread crumbs and provides an excellent flavor.  The underside of the chicken was a little soggy hence the 4 stars.

I tried this the other night and it was a big hit! I didn't have enough bread crumbs so added some graham cracker crumbs. I have to say I don't like mayo, but couldn't taste it in this. Making it again tonight

Going through my saved recipes and I can say I love this one... I will wait until it cools down here until I oven bake anything.  I did make this last winter and I did throw in more fresh garlic because I LOVE garlic.  Also I know I used light mayo because I don't buy anything else.  Looking forward to making this again this late fall/winter.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was a big hit.  My husband is not a big chicken lover but he said this was really good and that he looks forward to eating this again.  My daughter actually wanted seconds (which never happens).  The only changes I made was to add 1/2 cup of milk to 1/2 cup of mayo instead of 1 cup of mayo and to omit the thyme (husband doesn't like it). Will definately add to weekly rotation!

3 stars because this is good with boneless chicken breast, but with bone in, not so good.First time I used chicken breast. Delicious, moist. Second time around I used legs and thighs. Bland plain and simple. And yes 1 cup of mayo is way to much, scale it down to 1/2 cup.

I gave it 4 stars for taste, because it WAS tasty, but I would rank it lower for greasiness. I used only 1/2 cup mayo, and I only had about 8 drumsticks, not a whole cut up chicken. The half cup was too much, so I smeared some off, that was OK. And like I said, it WAS tasty, but it was far too greasy for me, even greasier than pan-frying the old fashioned way in a cast iron skillet. It might have been good on white meat, but I couldn't test that. I don't think I'll do this again, since I tend to buy legs only anyway. Thanks for the recipe though, I like trying new methods. :)

I used light mayo and added some Old Bay--a bit too peppery for anyone that's not a pepper lover. I baked it on the broil pan (eliminates the problem of the soggy bottoms) at 375.

This was a good recipe, but I think it needs a little more seasoning and could be crispier. Great basic recipe alternative to frying chicken though.

5 stars!!  I used 1lb of tenders and cooked it at 425 degrees 15 mins one side and 10 mins the other side as another reviewer suggested.....perfect!  I also used a mayo & whole milk mixture (1/2 cup mayo & 1/4 cup milk).  It stuck to the chicken perfectly.  I had just enough bread crumbs.  I served with Sandra Lee's Creole Grits.

it was SO delicious! The whole time i was eating I kept thinking 'I wish this would never end!' :) I did what another reviewer did and cut the mayo down and mixed it with buttermilk. I also soaked in buttermilk (Homemade btw) and dredged it in flour and the mix 3 times. SO crispy!!

This was good, not great.  The only changes I made was I didn't use the thyme because I didn't have any & after around 35 minutes I increased the temperature to 375 to make sure it was crispy.  Good for a family dinner but would not recommend it for dinner guest.  Will keep this recipe.  Thanks.

Very very good. I made this, but used potato flakes instead of bread crumbs. It was way good!

I used only chicken breasts.  The mayonnaise is the ingredient which makes the chicken taste so moist!  I  also  lightly seasoned the chicken with  "Adobo" seasoning, in addition to the seasonings called for in the recipe.  Easy to make!

This is soooo good.  I just love the fact that you can get essentially "fried" tasting chicken from the oven.  No grease mess and no grease smell in your kitchen that seems to linger.  Very moist and I did use less mayo and used Panko, Old Bay and Garlic Powder just because I know my family.  They love love loved it!  A keeper!  Also, I cooked it on a broiler pan.  Worked out great, crispy all around.  Thank you to the creator of this recipe.

As with any recipe,I tweak it some.......I added cayenne pepper,poultry seasoning and sage to breading which you can make from many different things you have on hand...also I added ranch dressing the first time and blue cheese the second time to the mayo...both were good and gave it a bolder flavor..also I let the breaded chicken "age" for an hr so flavors could meld before baking...I went with 375 for 1 hr

This was delicious!  I used boneless chicken breast and light ranch dressing instead of mayo and added a little hot sauce to the ranch to spice it up a little and it was AWESOME!!  I think i may have to try exactly as I cooked it in a chicken burger next time :D  I also cooked it on a rack over the cookie sheet with a higher cooking temp (375) as was suggested in one of the comments and it worked great to keep it from getting soggy on the bottom.

WOW! I've been making oven-fried chicken for years, mainly with cornflake crumbs, and it just wasn't coming out so well. If my husband hadn't helped me make it, he says he'd have sworn it was fried! Used 1 egg and 2 Tbsp. nondairy caesar dressing instead of mayonnaise.

This is my favorite recipe for oven fried chicken. The mayo mix keeps the chicken extra-moist and the chicken always comes out juicy and crispy. I spray mine with Pam before putting it in the oven to make sure the top has a nice crunch to it.

I guess my rating is a little unfair as I'm a vegetarian so I didn't eat this, however, I made this for my husband and son. My son, who is an eclectic eater and normally loves the chicken dishes I make for him, said he didn't like it and hardly touched it eating only his vegetables. My husband on the other hand said it was okay but not as tender as most of the other chicken dishes I make for them. Followed the recipe as written. Will not make this again.

I'm only giving this receipe a 3 star rating due to my personal preference.  It was very good but it reminded me of "Shake & Bake" which I was never really fond of but a lot less preparation time.  It probably won't be a repeat with in this house hold.  Just to pub a perspective on this receipe, I am a 72 year old who still prefers the unhealthy southern (greasy) fried (iron skillet) method.

Wow!  I was skeptical when it said mayo but I was willing to give it a try.   It was completely juicy and the spices were perfect.  I used three large bone in breasts since we are not dark meat people.  I used just enough mayo to coat the chicken (less than the cup it called for) and it came out perfect!

This was really tasty.  I did use less mayo than the recipe calls for.  Nice and crispy on the outside and juicy inside.  I may substitute corn meal for bread crumbs next time just for giggles.

This turned out way better than expected and I was very pleasantly surprised! I wasn't really expecting much more than shake-and-bake, but it was crispy, juicy, and totally delicious!! Me, hubs, and two kids gave it a thumbs up- the thirds said "too squishy", so next time I'll be more conservative with the mayo. Bravo, terrific recipe! This is definitely going into regular rotation!

This was a hit at our house. I used 2.75 lbs of chicken legs and ended up needing a little more breading. I was about out of breadcrumbs so I used Ritz crackers too. The chicken was VERY juicy and the spices were right on. Thanks for the keeper!!!

Yummy! We were in a need of a grocery run so I substituted organic yogurt for the mayo, used rye cracker crumbs verses bread crumbs and replaced the thyme and paprika with Old Bay... so good!!  Note: A drizzling of oil before baking is necessary since the yogurt is not near as fatty as the mayo!

This was great!  I made it using breast tenders and they came out juicy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside.  I thought it may have been a little bit salty, so next time I will cut out some of the salt.

Used wheat saltine crackers mushed up as that's all I had on hand.  Only had 1/2 cup olive oil mayo.  Chicken really moist, better than pan cooked & crispy. Cooked at 375 for 20 minutes then flipped & cooked 400 for 25 more minutes.

I loved this! I followed reviews and made this with half mayo/half milk and loved it! Also just used chicken tenders, and cooked on a cookie rack. This is great! Even if I mix up the spices in the future, I will always use the mayo/milk combo. It definitely keeps it from being dry!

This is really good.  Very moist chicken.  I decided to use ranch dressing instead of plain mayo as someone suggested and it was great!  Will make again.

Very juicy and awesome flavours.  I made the mistake of browning first, no need to.

Pretty good! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half length-wise to get six huge chicken tender-type things.  Used a canola-based mayonnaise, and half plain, half panko bread crumbs.  I think because I used skinless the crust really did not get all that crisp, but the chicken was still very moist and delicious.  Didn't taste the mayo at all.  Thanks Elizabeth!  ***Update: Made a second time using chicken thighs and legs.  This time I mixed a little milk with the mayo to thin it some (used olive oil based mayo this time) and added some additional seasonings, Bell's poultry seasoning, cayenne and onion powder.  The chicken was so moist and delicious, and this time crisped up nicely, although it still had that "breaded" chicken taste vs. battered and fried.  Still a great recipe!

Very good, simple recipe. I used 8 chicken breasts, 1/2 c. of mayo to keep the fat down, and the dry ingredients as stated. The proportions were all right-used it all up. My hubby and 3 girls all liked it, even my self proclaimed 8 year old "vegetarian" who rarely likes meat dishes. I agree w/ another reviewer that the thyme is a bit overwhelming-I'll just use a bit less next time. This would not be mistaken for actual fried chicken-not crispy enough, though with skin on pieces maybe that's not the case.  I baked the breasts at 350 for about 30 minutes until they reached 165. A keeper-will do often, I'm sure.

I thought these were just okay.  I think Shake N' Bake is better.  I will probably make it again and play with adding more ingredients.

The chicken did come out very tender, so that's where this gets 3 stars. I will use the mayonnaise coating again. However, the flavor of the breading wasn't very good. I even added Panko and a ton of seasoning to the bread crumbs. I can't imagine how bland it would have been if I'd just used the seasoning listed. It also never really got crispy. The only "crunch" came from the Panko flakes.

I followed some of the other's suggestions and baked it on a rack that I put on a baking sheet and turned half way.  The outside was not soggy, though it wasn't like fried chicken.  Also I thought the flavors weren't strong enough.  Next time I'll double the spices.

This was very simple and very tasty. I used yogurt instead of mayonnaise to be a bit healthier and that worked fine and kept the chicken moist. I also used an "Italian seasonings" mix for the spice and that was good too.

This was quite good, especially for something that I could just whip up on short notice. I did add a touch of cyanne pepper just to give it a spark. I did use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 ranch salad dressing. The one problem I did have was that the coating flaked off when I would pick up or bite into it. I did use use crushed up saltines instead of bread crumbs because that was all that I had. But the flavor was darn good. Will make again.

Awesome and Easy! I did make a few changes. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and used only 1 tablespoon mayo to coat each. I also used poutry seasoning instead of thyme & a little cayenne pepper instead of paprika. Added a little onion powder. Have made this a few times and it always turns out great!  Thanks

I gave it four stars because my kids liked the recipe but I didn't. It took longer in the oven than I thought it would so I put aluminum foil over them and it made them soggy. But like I said, my kids loved it so it must have been really great.

I just finished preparing this dish and it was superb!! What I did differently was instead of bread crumbs I used frosted flakes (because that's what I had handy) and that with the mayo made it taste absolutely delicious.  Great recipe!

I cooked the recipe exactly as stated, and while the chicken was very moist and juicy (without skin) I thought it should have been cooked a bit longer to get crispier. I will try again cooking an additional 15 minutes or so and raising the temp to 375 for that add'l time. Also, I will use a little less pepper as my kids thought it was a tad 'spicy'.

This was pretty good...simple. I added parmesean cheese to the bread crumb mixture to kick it up a notch ;) It was a little to bready i guess would be the word maybe dry, but not the chicken itself that was moist. I will probably make again but add some melted butter to the top of the chicken

Super easy and yummy.  I took the skin off the breats and thighs.  Remember, season to taste!  1 tsp black pepper was a little too much for my kidos.  I also baked on a slotted broiler pan to keep the pieces from sitting in any grease.

This was bad! It might have been moist, but the breading was soggy and blah.  I even turned the oven up to 400 and cooked for another 10-15 min and it was still not crispy. Won't try this again.

This was a huge hit with my children.  I used panko instead of dry bread crumbs.  Also used ranch dressing instead of mayo.  Also left skin on.  This is a "repeat" recipe which I would also use for my guests.  Thank you.

I'm lazy.  I marinated ckn in ranch dressing over night.  Rolled ckn in crushed  garlic croutons [didn't have any bread crumbs] and then baked the ckn.  Also I didn't add any extra seasoning.  Delicious!!!!

This was excellent and my family loved it. A few changes...I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and coated it with a homemade ranch dressing mix (1c lowfat mayo, 1c lowfat buttermilk mixed with 1 packet hidden valley ranch buttermilk dressing). I rolled the coated chicken in a mixture of italian bread crumbs, salt, garlic powder, tony chachere's, thyme. I also served mashed potatoes mixed with that homemade dressing & sour cream instead of milk & butter. I also tossed green beans with the same dressing.  It was a fairly low fat, excellent meal. Thanks for posting.

SO YUMMY!! My family has been begging me to make this all the time. A huge hit for everyone! I do half mayo with half milk but left everything else the same.

This is an awesome recipe.  My picky husband absolutely loves this and thinks it's better than 'regular' fried chicken.  I made a few changes: thinned mayo out with milk, used only drumsticks (thats everyone's favorite), cooked at 375 for last 15mn and used celery salt instead of regular salt.   This is a great recipe!!!!

These turned out really well.  They do look just like fried chicken.  I didn't have enough bread crumbs and substituted some crushed Ritz crackers and that worked well.  I think the flavor could be improved with maybe some rotisserie chicken seasoning, but over all it was an excellent recipe and I'll try it with boneless/skinless next time and reduce the cooking time.

Was delicious!! I did follow the many suggestions of using half the amount of mayo and mixing it with milk.I also boiled the chicken first, for 8 minutes then cooked at 395 for 16 minutes, flipped chicken and cooked another 16 minutes!!

Don't let the mayo scare you off.  The only reason I thought I would give it a try is because I love halibut broiled with a little layer of mayo on the top. Very very good, it has quickly became a staple in our house.

I read many of the reviews and incorporated the best ones into my dish, using only thighs.  However, it was just 'so-so', not a lot of flavor, the Panko crumbs did not stick as well as I thought they should.  I did add the additional seasonings that so many recommended, used 2/3 mayonnaise and 1/3 milk, but even that did not make this recipe a keeper...my husband says there are better 'oven-fried chicken' recipes and that I should keep searching.

This is a great recipe.  I loved the combination of seasonings.  I think I will try it next time using boneless chicken breasts, as I usually don't eat the skin and that would allow me to get the full benefit of the coating.  Highly recommended!

Wonderful and moist.  We used chicken breasts only.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut the mayo with milk.  I also added cayenne pepper to taste.  This will be a regular at our house.

Quite good...followed the advice of others.  Used only 1/2 cup mayo with 1/2 cup milk.  I also used poultry seasoning instead of thyme and paprika.  For further variation, in the last 10 minutes of cooking, I added 1 1/2 tbsp of pasta sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese to each piece of chicken.  Will make again!

This was excellent - moist chicken and a very zesty coating. I did not have any mayo, so I just dipped chicken tenders in ranch dressing, shook on coating and then cooked at 425 for 35 minuts (flipping at 15 minutes).  My husband raved about this chicken.  Thanks for this keeper!

I add no-salt italian seasoning, dried onions, and some garlic salt and it makes the taste a lot more flavorful.  Otherwise, I found it a little bland.

Very good! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into strips to make chicken fingers. The cooking time was about 30-35 mins. Next time I think I will bake at a higher temperature for shorter time. Nice alternative to fried chicken. Thanks (:

I followed this recipe exactly except for the thyme, I was out. This was a great way to cook chicken so it was crispy, flavorful and not so greasy. My husband really enjoyed it. This was not hard to make and the flavor was great. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe came out great! I bought chicken thighs and drumsticks, took the skin off and brushed it mainly with ranch dressing (with a dab of mayo mixed in since I was trying to keep the fat content down). As another reviewer had tried panko crumbs, I also used panko breadcrums. I threw in garlic powder, garlic salt, cayenne (for a kick), paprika, essence, and some black pepper. My husband loved it and gave it a thumbs up for a re-make! A healthier alternative to KFC!

Before you read this review, understand that I am one of "THOSE" reviewers who has changed almost everything about this recipe except the chicken and the mayo (..sorry).  As far as the mayo goes, I'm very pleasantly surprised at the results (1/2 c. was more than enough for me.)  I wasn't in the mood for the recommended spices, so I did salt, pepper, 2/3 c. parmesan cheese, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp oregano.  I did not cut the chicken into pieces - i used two whole chicken breasts.  45 minutes still turned out to be the perfect amount of time for mouthwateringly moist and fully cooked chicken.

This recipe was very good.  I had 8 chicken thighs and put 4 in two different pans, hoping it would be a little less greasy.  I used a silicone brush to spread the mayo on the chicken so I probably only used about 1/4 c mayo.  It was great and very easy to clean up.  I will be making this again, thanks.

This recipe came out really well. I used the recommendations to thin the mayo with milk and I didn't have bread crumbs so I used croutons. I also added a little flour to the breading. But it came out very well, my family loved it. A great alternative to fried chicken.

Great recipe. The only changes I made: I used corn flake crumbs instead of read crumbs, and like someone else suggested, watered down the mayonnaise. Turns out great - have made 3 times already. Thanks.

Ran out of mayonnaise so had to use milk. Baked this on a rack as others have suggested but it didn't come out crispy at all - don't know if not using mayo was the problem. Anyway, hubby and I liked this recipe and the chicken came out juicy. Would make again, next time with mayo!

Very good! Be sure bread crumbs are very fine. I also added a half teaspoon of dry mustard and a teaspoon of baking powder. Next time, I would cut down on the thyme.

made this chicken for the first time and yes it is oh so tender and juicy, great recipe for people who love fried chicken but don`T like to fry things. Also my only change to this recipe is that I used chicken drumsticks and not a whole chicken. To everyone hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have

This was great, may have revived possibly freezer burned chicken drumsticks.  I cut the mayo by half with some lowfat yogurt, which also thinned the mayo.  I baked on the convection setting at 350 for 45 minutes, then another 20 at 425.  Skin was crisp with fat rendered off since I had held the drumsticks up off the bottom of the pan, placing them on a rack while baking.  Pleased both my fat loving husband and fat hating me.

This chicken was moist, but was anything BUT, like fried chicken. Made as directed exactly, it wasn't crunchy at all, and the texture of the chicken was strange, with all the dry, but somewhat moist bread crumbs in your mouth. Would NEVER make again!!!

I pretty much followed this recipe, except I did my own thing w/the seasonings. paprika,lots of garlic powder, alittle curry powder & cayenne, salt & pepper. I didn't measure anything. I whisked the mayo & milk for a smooth consistency & added the spices. Then I dipped the thighs(w/bone) into mayo-milk then coated the pieces with plain breadcrumbs-I baked for 30min.(uncovered)then flipped them over for another 30min. So moist & crunchy!!! Will definitely make again w/other chicken pieces & spices. Make sure to line your dish w/foil, makes the clean-up a breeze.

Good recipe, but had to cook about 30 minutes longer in my oven (uncovered). Used 1/4 cup Miracle Whip and 1/4 cup regular Ranch dressing like others suggested. Had a surprising zing.

Pretty good! I used 1/2 cup mayo which was plenty coating for 12 drumsticks. They were ready cooking at 375 for 50 minutes. Will make again.

This was very good. I don't like frying so this was a great alternative. Instead of using mayo I used ranch dressing..the use of mayo (ranch in my case) must be the key to keeping it moist. The only thing I will do differently next time is flip the chicken halfway thru the baking process as the underside didn't get as crispy as I'd like. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is my new favorite chicken recipe!  The mayo definitely sticks/helps the coating stick much better than egg.  The skin was crispy and moist, perfect.  For a bit of added flavor (not that it was needed, but my husband loves saucy chicken), I brushed BBQ sauce over chicken pieces while they were baking.

This was very yummy. I was surprised. I usually don't like oven fried chicken because it's dry. This was very moist. I did change up the batter a little. I also used miracle whip instead of regular mayo. I didn't have regular bread crumbs. I used Italian bread crumbs mixed with saltine crackers and a little bit of French's fried onions. I added kosher salt instead of regular table salt. I also added 1/2 tsp of Emeril's seasoning. I increased the temp to 400 for an additional 15 min. The chicken was perfect! My husband loved it. I will make this again for sure!

This was a nice way to make chicken, especially for my little ones who are picky. I used a basting brush to swath on ranch dressing and coated them in italian style breadcrumbs. That was it. They baked for about 50 minutes in a convection oven and were crispy.

This was good; didn't come out as *fried* chicken, though. Could be because I used boneless tenderloins that were skinless. The tops were ok, but I didn't grease the dish well enough so that I could flip them with 10 minutes to go. Taste was good, a tad too much pepper for us. Kids DEVOURED it though, and that is always a good thing. Thanks - will be using again!

Fabulous recipe, easy and quick to make.  The chicken was moist and tasty, husband loved it!  1/3 to 1/2 cup mayonnaise is plenty, I used someone elses idea and baked them on a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet...allowed for ventilation all around.  I did drumsticks only, will try others next time.

This is great - a real winner in our house. You can use less mayo if you want to cut down on fat, just smear the chicken with a very thin layer of mayo and then roll in the bread crumb mixture.  Yum!

I don't eat chicken on the bone, so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts as another reviewer did. I only used 1/2 cup of miracle whip (not a mayo fan). I was disappointed because the chicken was like shake and bake. Next time I will try boneless with skins. Maybe that will help. It was juicy, just not like fried chicken.

For starters, I followed the recipe exactly using skinless chicken thighs (most seem to have altered recipe)..I did add small amounts of mayo at a time, therefore there wasn't any excess that would have been thrown out (not an ingredient I like to waste)  I liked the thickness of the mayo without milk, dressing, etc.  I think it made a good tacky glue for the coating to stick to, although I can't say I noticed the presence of mayo in the chicken after cooked.  I like the thyme, it gave the chicken a nice flavor-definitely use the thyme.  I cooked the chicken in the a.m. and served it cold for dinner with 'restaurant-style potato salad' from this site (good and hearty) and corn on the cob. Husband simply said "this is GOOD chicken" but he never comments on anything I make so I was flattered!  In my opinion though it was nothing over-the-top..still tasty though so 4 stars:D

I SO wanted to love this, but it just didn't appeal to my family. I used boneless, skinless breasts. I thinned out the mayo with Ranch dressing and used Panko; I also raised the heat to 375 and cooked for an hour based on prior reviews. When I went to remove the chicken from the pan, I lost all of the breading on the bottom because it was soggy and stuck to the pan. The flavor was nice, and the meat was tender, but it was very soggy and not at all crisp. Obviously I should have used much less mayo/Ranch mix, but I'm not sure that would have made it crisp, just less wet. It was delicious, just too soggy for my family.

This chicken came out perfect, sooo juicy with a delicious coating and alot less fat vs. frying. I did use a 18 package of drums, thighs and wings so I doubled the coating ingredients and it was just enough. The family thought it was great. Thanks for sharing!!

This chicken was delicious! I read several reviews and used some of the ideas. I mixed the mayo w/buttermilk ranch dressing and a splash or two of milk. It worked well and added a bit of extra flavor from the dressing. I used ranch-flavored bread crumbs mixed with some crushed corn flakes. I added some garlic/herb seasoning, lemon-pepper, basil, oregano, and a Texas favorite-chili powder. I used boneless/skinless breasts, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. The topping was crisp, the chicken was moist and oh so flavorful. I'll be making this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing Elizabeth!

Crispy? Although I baked them at 350 for 1hr to ensure they would be fully cooked, the skin was slimy! I would flash fry them 1st next time before baking, if indeed there is a next time.

This came out amazing! Nice and crispy and the meat was nice and tender. I used bone in chicken thighs with the skin on. I added the mayo to a ziploc bag and added the chicken, keeping it in the fridge overnight. I also premixed the coating - I did use  different seasonings - Seasoned salt, poultry seasoning, paprika, thyme and pepper. I was told that there would be no complaints if I made this again. And I definitely will. I would like to try it woith boneless, skinless to see if the tenderness and flavour are the same.

I had fun with this recipe. It was sooooo delicious! I was short on mayo so I used half mayo half ranch dressing. I used crushed ranch flavored crutons instead of bread crumbs just because I had them on hand. So simple and easy. Great recipe. I cooked the chicken for 1 hour. Chicken with pink on the inside grosses me out so the 45 minutes sounded too short for my tastes. Thanks for sharing this easy after work week day recipe.

This is such an awesome recipe. The mayonnaise made this oven fried chicken really something. I added cornflakes to my bread crumbs and it made it extra crispy. Yummy! I've made this twice now and the family and friends loved it! No more dipping in flour and eggs for me! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Very versatile recipe in that you can use whatever spices you like.  Very tasty, but 45 minutes is definitely not enough time.  I cooked our drumsticks for 1 hour and still was undercooked.  I will try again and add another 15 minutes or take other people's advice and cook at a higher temp.

I mixed in instant potato flakes and crushed saltines to the bread crumb mixture (I used seasoned bread crumbs)I also added some extra seasonings. I added a little champagne vinegar to the mayo.  Bake time was perfect at 45 minutes.

Really easy and the kids love it.  We never have bread crumbs in the house so I usually use what ever kind of crackers we have on hand amd toss them in the food processer.  Always comes out great.

Was a great hit with the family (I never make "fried" stuff)  Wish I would have used ranch dressing instead of mayo...  I liked the moist meat but prefer a crunchier outside.

Really Good. I use just enough mayonaise to lightly coat the chicken. I don't measure the mayo but I know it's way less than a cup. I add extra seasons to the bread crumb mix such as onion powder & italian season. The chicken really does come out tender. It has been known to fall off the bone.

Very good and moist.  I used corn flakes for extra crunch, but that didn't evenly coat the chicken with the spices as they fell to the bottom of the bowl.  Next time I'll still use the flakes but do it in a bag.

This was very good. I put a cup of dry stuffing mix in the bottom of the baking dish and sprinkled it with olive oil, then put the chicken on top. Wonderful! Thanks for posting this recipe.

Excellent! Rather than 1 C mayo, I used 1/2 C mayo and 1/2 C sour cream, added milk to thin. I rolled my chicken in flour, dipped in mayo/sc/milk mixture and then bread crumbs. I served this with a side of dirty rice from this site, mashed potatoes and biscuits. Loaded with carbs but the boys sure did love it!!!

This was sooooooo Yummy! I put some mayo in a bowl and lightly slathered (just enough for the bread mixture to stick)6 big chicken breasts. I put garlic salt, pepper, paprika, and seasoning salt into the bread crumbs.
I tured out so well. My 3 & 2 year loved it  Just make sure to turn the chicken half way through cooking to make sure both sides brown. I cooked it at 375 for 40 minutes.  What are you waiting for go start cooking! :o)

YUM! I love mayonnaise but was doubtful about how it would turn out with baked chicken. With so many good reviews, I was still tempted to try it and I'm glad I did because it was fantastic!!!! I used a package of drumsticks (which contained 5 pieces) and removed the skins from them. I started off with only 1/2 c. mayo, as other suggested, which was plenty... I also decreased the ingredients for the crumb mixture (I used plain breadcrumbs). I baked it for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees and it came out PERFECT. Very tender. You can't really taste the mayo and the crumb mixture had just enough of each seasoning. If you're thinking about trying this, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Delicious!  I removed the skin, used very little mayo (just enough to lightly coat the chicken so the breading mixture will stick), and baked at 375 for 45-50 minutes.

I thought this was very easy and I followed the recipe exactly as posted.  I would make a few changes next time though.  First of all, I would BARELY use any mayonaise.  I mixed the mayo with a little bit of milk so it would spread on to the chicken easier, those pieces were good, the ones that were slathered in mayo before I thinned it had too much mayo and hubby could see it when he was eating.  Next time I will bake at 375 for 30 minutes, turn and bake for an additional 30 minutes.  The skin didn't crisp like a fried chicken should, but the family was fooled and enjoyed it none the less.  Overall, pretty good!!

Yummy Yum Yum!  My husband and I loved this.  I took the skin off the chicken before preparation and it still tasted great.  In fact, I think it would have been too greasy with the skin on.  Also, I thought it was a little salty - and I love salt.  Next time I'll use 1/2 t. and add any additional salt at the table.  But, I added some parmesean cheese to the breadcrumbs (about 1/4 c. - something I learned from another oven fried chicken recipe), so maybe that was why it was salty.  Otherwise, I absolutely loved this recipe and will definitely make this chicken again.

My family loved this. My three kids (ages 7, 4, and 2) ate this up and asked for it again the next night. Quick and easy! I was skeptical about the mayo too but my hubbie is a mayo fanatic so I said what the heck ~ wonderful!!! He asked me to just make a plate of skins next time!

I really never liked chicken, until I made this.  Everybody loved it.  It made my husband happy who is a big time chicken lover.  It was very moist and easy to fix.  The only draw back was it was kinda messy.  But for a great taste it was worth it.

ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY AWESOME!
First time trying it, and loved it!!!
I'm from Maryland so, of course Old Bay was added, which turned out to be a great choice. 
I used drumsticks and thighs, skin on, marinated 24 HOURS, in a mix of buttermilk / LOTS of Old Bay / Frank's Red Hot sauce.
Enough to coat.
As for the mayo, I added a touch of milk to thin, and mixed in a pack of Ranch dressing mix. 
As for the Panko mixture, I also added a pack of Ranch dressing mix, and of course Old Bay.
Convection baked on cookie sheet with wire rack 375 for 1 hour.
Did not turn.
Crazy crispy coating with soo much flavor, and super tender meat thanks to the buttermilk.
Definitely a keeper!
Going to be making this again trying with Bone in & boneless breasts, and ESPECIALLY some type of fish/seafood.

I made this twice.  The first time I mixed the mayonnaise with some milk.  The second time I just used the mayonnaise.  I think just straight mayo is the best.  Note that I used this as a base and didn't use the seasonings.  I used Creole seasoning (Tony Chachere's) in the bread crumbs.  Then thought why not add it to the mayo to add extra flavor.  I think stirring the mayo helps it not be so clumpy too.

Turned out delicious and moist.  My family loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  My husband wanted fried chicken and I didn't want the grease.  Made it with split chicken breasts.  Delicious!  I was not generous with the mayo because chicken breasts can be dry. They were very moist and not greasy.  I did spray a little canola spray on the coating to help it crisp up.

Made this recipe as written, just scaled by maybe half for 1lb of chicken breasts that I cut into strips. I had Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain, and still added all the seasonings...WOW. This is such a flavorful and amazing recipe! My almost 2 year old loved it, and I’m sure my husband and 4 year will love it too when I make it again!

Loved the general formula. Used boneless chicken breasts as this is what I had on hand (cut them in half). Agree with many reviewers that the amount of mayo to coat the chicken is more like 1/2 vs 1 c. Added some cayenne and grated Parmesan to the crumb mixture. I didn't want the chicken to be soggy, so I jacked up the heat to 400 and kept my eye on it (left my boneless pieces in the oven for 25 minutes). I was really happy with the results.

Delicious.  The mayonnaise kept the breading on and the meat moist.  Very easy to make.  This is now my go-to recipe for fried chicken.  Easy cleanup, too.  I save empty cereal box liners to shake the chicken in the bread crumbs.

Next time, I will use only 1/2 cup mayo for one cut up chicken and also remove the skin.

Next time I will cook at higher temp so it browns better.  Thank you.

With the exception of the seasonings, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was an abysmal failure for me. With all the excellent reviews, I have to assume it was a flaw in the preparation, and not the recipe. The coating fell off and left rubbery skin...I was horrified. We stripped the skin off and used the chicken for chicken salad, because no one liked it.

The chicken was very tender but there was too much mayo.  I used Panko breading but, maybe it was because there was too much mayo, I found it to be too thick and more breading than I would have preferred.  My daughter loved it though and ate everything on her plate which is rare.

It was ok but next time I will use poultry seasoning instead of the thyme . The person that diluted the mayo with milk would be a good move.

Made with boneless breast of chicken - used half mayo and half milk whisked for dipping and cooked 15 minutes longer, turning once (used cookie sheets with racks so no sticking to bottom).  Really delicious - my family and company loved the flavor - and so much easier than fried chicken while providing a nice crispy crust.  Great recipe!

I used this recipe for half my oven fried chicken, and my Betty Crocker traditional recipe for the other half.  I definitely preferred this method, using mayonnaise for the fat.  I agree with other reviewers who suggested using poultry seasoning instead of thyme.  Thyme is too strong a flavor.  I also followed a reviewers suggestion and thinned the mayonnaise a bit with milk.  Panko works just as well as bread crumbs - I might prefer it.  A bit of Parmesan added to the Panko is great too.

This was a good recipe however, my goal was to create a healthier alternative to fried chicken, and I feel as though coating it in mayo would add quite a bit of fat  and calories I was trying to avoid so I substituted it with nonfat plain greek yogurt and it came out great and tasted just the same while still keeping the chicken moist.

The only thing I had to change because I didn't have bread crumbs is I used Doritos. I crushed them in place of the bread crumbs. WONDERFUL!!! Will make a lot more often now.

Delicious + easy = my type of cooking and this recipe comes through! I love that we can cook this when we are  in the mood for fried chicken because we rarely eat fried foods (maybe once or twice a year).  This recipe is a great treat for when you want to eat something a little more unhealthy but much better than deep fried.  The chicken is moist and the crust perfectly crispy and flavorful, much better than some more complicated oven fried chicken I've tried on this site. 
To give a fair review I always follow the recipe exactly as written the first time and then adjust to my tastes as needed. The only thing I do differently now is ignore the amount of mayonnaise suggested because it's kind of overkill. I just scoop out a small amount of mayo into a small bowl and  rub a very thin layer over the chicken, just enough so that the bread crumbs will stick. I also use Panko breadcrumbs because they are our preference and I cook for a little over an hour because we like crispy skin.  Great recipe, thanks!

This came out very well. I suggest the use of smoked paprika and some cayenne pepper for added kick.

By the way I'm not a cook. This recipe was very easy to follow.

My boyfriend and I loved this! He's a self proclaimed fried chicken snob and said this was better than anything he has ever tasted. Super easy and fun to make together. We put the wet and dry mix into zip lock bags which resulted in no mess. Like other people cut the mayo in half and added milk.

I used legs only and I adjusted the spices a little, but these really did come out very moist and tasty. Even my toddler loved it. I definitely plan to make them again. I just won't tell my husband there's mayonnaise in them.

This was a good alternative to fried chicken, easy to make and tasty.  It was not as crispy as I would like and my husband would prefer fried chicken, but this is a better, easier, healthier version.  I followed some of the suggestions and diluted the mayonnaise with milk.  I also substituted our family's usual fried chicken spices for the ones in the recipe.  It was delicious and I will make it again.

I made mine with plain breadcrumbs, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp garlic pepper, 1 tsp poultry flavoring, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tbsp italian seasoning for 2 lbs of chicken thighs. They came out delicious and very moist and tender. I didn't measure the mayo, so I probably put too much on (pretty well slathered them). I will use less next time and hope the skin is crispier. Will definitely make again.

Was leary at first about the mayo but pleasantly surprised at how juicy chicken turned out. I took skin off of mine & let pieces set in fridge for 15mins prior to cooking so coating could "rest".

I will make this again. I added some panko crumbs to the regular bread crumbs to give it a little more crunch.  Also, a handy tip for cleanup:  I put a little mayo in a plastic bag and added the chicken and smooshed it around a little.  Then I was able to toss the mayonnaise bag -- easy peasy and no mayo to clean.

Delish!  As per other review:  1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. buttermilk , 1/4 c. ranch dressing.  Used panko crumbs.  Used eight chicken breasts.  Had to make two batches of crumbs due to size of breasts.  Worked better for me  to dredge the breasts  in crumbs rather than use ziplock bag.  Baked @ 400 for 20 minutes, turned for another 25 minutes.  (Thermometer registered 165 for chicken).  Glass pan batch was easier to clean than rack.  I didn't notice much difference in crunchy texture.

Great recipe. My family loved the crunchy coating. I did cut down on the amount of mayo and added milk, based on other reviews. Will be making this again as an alternative to fried chicken.

Not good. Bread crumbs don't stick to the meat. Flavour was good but at the end of it all, doesn't look 'fried'.

This chicken is delicious.  I made a couple of changes after reading the reviews,  used 1/2 panko and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs and thinned  the mayo out with some buttermilk.  I baked it on a rack for 25 min. per side at 400F,  nice and crispy and tender & juicy inside.

This is very easy to make and my family really liked it. Only a couple of changes for next time; use 1/2 cup of mayo, remove skin from chicken and turn after 15 minutes of cooking so that both sides brown.

Crunchy, juicy and delicious chicken. I used skinless drumsticks. As other reviewers did, I thinned the mayo with 3 Tablespoons of milk. I cooked on a greased cooling rack put on a cookie sheet, at 375 degrees  for 40 minutes.

Used bone-in, skinless, thighs from chickens we raised. 
The 50/50 ratio of mayo/milk others suggested was a good call,  but the next time I'm going to do drumsticks and try it with a 60/40 mayo/milk and see what difference it makes. 
I also used the suggested 400°F @ 40 minutes; turning after 20 minutes. And, I used Progresso® Italian Breadcrumbs - note on this, if you want more Italian flavor add extra herbs and spices to taste as it's a little bland to me.
The chicken turned out delicious.  It was very tender; the texture was moist & flaky (separated well like you would see from a can of tuna), and was so juicy when I picked up one of the thighs with the tongs juice squirted across the counter! Definitely going to make this again.

My oldest son was asking me how I made it. That means he likes it and wants to eat this again. So, I gave him the details including where I found the recipe. 3 for 3 males from 12 to 20 years old liked it! I did use much less mayo and covered it with foil for the first 30 min. I had to add 5 min. to the cooking time. This chicken was juicy and delicious. I didn't like that there was only one piece left for me.

I will make this again. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed up club crackers. Took the advice of another reviewer and didn't use as much mayo and mixed the mayo with some milk.  I cut my chicken breast in half so they would be done with the smaller pieces.

This was OK. I didn't have Mayo on hand so I used miracle whip which gave it an odd taste. Next time I will use real Mayo and season the way I season my fried chicken which I use different spices than this recipe uses. This is a good. recipe though. Just tweak the seasonings to your liking and def use a rack to keep bottoms from getting soggy.

It was very tasty. I did replace thyme with oregano and added some cayenne pepper for kick. Unfortunately the outside wasn't very crispy.  I would make it again if there was a way to get more crisp

"Better thank KFC!" said my 8 year old. I baked 18 drumsticks and used 1/2 cup mayo mixed with 1/2 cup milk. Still too much mayo mix left. Next time I will use 1/4 cup of each. I did use dried parsley instead of thyme (I didn't have any), added a dash of pepper and a teaspoon or so of grated parmesan to the breadcrumb mix. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This is hands down, one of the best recipes ever. I'd even dare to say...better than fried chicken because it tastes the same without the after effects of the deep fried! I used panko bread crumbs for the extra crunch and basically used any of my favourite dried seasonings. It also helped that I pre-seasoned the chicken with my mom's home-made seasoning to give it that extra flavour. 

The mayo to coat is the best advice ever! It keeps the chicken so moist and holds the seasoned crust on the chicken for that bang of flavour, yet allows the crust to remain crunchy. I'll never use eggs again in this context.

My final tip - use a rack to rest the chicken on when baking. it ensures that the chicken remains crunchy and not get soggy as placing in the foil could sometimes encourage. Also, you don't have to deal with removing it from the foil with the best part of your chicken coming off. If you have a convection oven and you use the rack, it even cooks in less time :) So you do have to keep a close eye on it. mine took at least 15 mins less which was a plus, especially if you're hangry!

This turned out great. My husband LOVES fried chicken and as much as I would live to make it for him, I can't stand at the stove for very long... So this was a great substitute! He loved it!! I used thighs and breasts, both boneless.
I did use half mayo & half milk...I think it turned out perfectly. Moist on the inside and crisp on the outside... Just like pan fried chicken, but without being at all greasy.  I'll make it again for sure.

Made the recipe exactly as written.  The chicken turned out tender, but the breading did not stick to the chicken.  My husband thought it tasted good but our son and I didn't love it.  It was salty and the thyme flavor was strong.   If I were to try making it again I would use different spices and less salt.

Everyone in my house loved this recipe. I made it as written, and thought it was just 3 stars because I like my chicken seasoned differently and I wasn't so fond of the regular bread crumbs. I made it a second time and absolutely loved it. I like panko bread crumbs better, it taste a lot crispier. I would give it 5 stars with chipotle panko then it is really spicy. You should definitely give this recipe a try.

It was ok, the chicken was really moist which was good, but the breading was just ok and it didn't stick to the chicken very well once it was cooked.

Quick whether mixed in a bag or or pressed on a plate. It needs to be a bit tastier, not sure what spice I would increase just to add more flavor. Yes, it is moist!

Great recipe, though I did add in some other spices and used chicken breasts. Cooked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes....20 min each side. Chicken came out juicy with a crunch coating of crumbs. Will make again

Go with Panko bread crumbs rather than regular, and you will be rewarded with much better crusty moist chicken. All in all (double pun intended) good recipe.

Very good. Crispy and moist. I used chicken drumsticks. I used  Italian breadcrumbs, 1/4 c mayo and 1/4 c milk.  Baked at 375 for 30 min and then 350 for 15 min.  Husband and kids  loved it .

PERFECT!  Wish I could give it 10 stars.  I doubled all but the pepper and mayonaise and coated 4 huge breast with bone, one leg and one wing.  I had some of the bread crumbs left but wanted to be sure I had enough.  I didn't measure the mayonaise but don't think I used a full cup.  This is the most juicy, fabulous, FRIED chicken ever!!  I didn't have dried tyme and used fresh and it was perfect!  Thank you! I did turn chicken half way through.  I used a large sheet pan and lined it with parchment paper to avoid the mess.

Delicious! I used Italian bread crumbs with Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. I added a bit of sea salt and garlic powder. I kept tasting till I thought flavor was good. I didnt use milk with the mayo. Coated chicken pieces well, then put in bread crumb mixture. I dont like thyme, so left that out. Very, very good!

So good. I did do what a lot of the others recommend and did half a cup mayo and half a cup of milk. This has to be one of the best ways to hold a batter on that i have ever seen.

I don't eat chicken but still cook it for my kids...and they liked this!  I am always skeptical of any recipe that contains cooked mayo, but I took the advice of some other reviewers and thinned it out first with a little milk, and it really helped the crumb topping to adhere.  The drippings made a tasty chicken gravy, also.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it. I actually made chicken legs and cooked 25 mins on each side at 400 degrees.
My son is a picky eater, still at age 32, and I told him about it and he said he would try it. This is so much easier and less clean up then frying in a fry pan.

Yum!!! Yum!!!! Used grill mate chicken seasoning with the bread crumbs instead of garlic powder and paprika. Placed the chicken on cookie cooling rack with a tray under for drippings but the bottoms were still a little soggy. Otherwise it was delicious, juicy and tender.. Double bread crumbs mixture... N reduce the mayo to 1/4 cup with 1/4 cup milk. Had plenty of leftover which had to be thrown away..

I had such a high expectation on this recipe because of the high mark.  To me, it was ok and the taste was rather bland.  I used 10 drumsticks with skin that were about 3LB total, and I didn't make much of the modification other than using half panko and half Italian bread crumbs, and cooking temperature and time. The meat was moist and tender, for sure, and the coating came out as I liked.  So for that, I gave 3 stars.  One thing that I wasn't sure about was the cooking time.  There was no way the chicken would come out in 45 min at 350 degrees temperature.  I followed 45 min at 350 first, and noted not much juice coming out of chicken, so increased to 375 degrees and cooked another 30 min.  3LB or whole chicken would sure take longer than 45 min, especially if the temperature was only 350 degrees. As mentioned above, chicken meat was moist and tender, but other than the crust, meat itself didn't have any kind of flavor, and it was a bit greaser because of mayo and skin. I didn't particularly impressed with using mayo, as I didn't taste mayo anyway. It just gave me an extra grease. Maybe better using other liquid (like milk) for coating. No need to grease a cooking pan, as enough grease would come out of chicken anyway. I would rather want to trim excess fat.

I love this chicken!  I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and rinse and pat them dry.  I also use crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs.  The first time I used Ritz crackers, and this last time I used the Keebler Club crackers.  I used one sleeve of crackers and then doubled all the spices.  I used poultry seasoning instead of thyme because it's all I had.  Turned out very crispy!  If the timer goes off and the coating is still soggy in some parts, I pop it in the broiler for a few minutes.  Great recipe, my favorite of all oven fried chicken variations I've tried.  Thank you.

hey people!! My tummy has OVERDOSED ON AMAZING! I have to tell you how amazing this chicken was! I have been cooking chicken for years, all sorts of ways, but it has never ever come out this moist! I gave it a 5 just for that. I did follow some other peeps on here and did half mayo, half ranch, and Im glad I did. But Im absolutely sure it was something I did, the crust wasn't so crunchy. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and cooked it at 400 degrees for 40 min then flipped it and cooked it for another 10.I think ima try panko breadcrumbs next time. I am going to try to figure out what I did wrong so that next time I will achieve perfect chicken. Thank you for posting this!

Since I make chocolate-mayo cake all the time-I wasnt shocked. That cake is the best.That being said- I used Panko crumbs,and followed the seasonings,just cutting back a wee bit on the thyme.Used a rubber spatula for putting on the mayo.Since I had mayo left in the bowl I would say you could cut that back to 1/2 cup,I used 3 breasts-with skin off.I cooked at 350* for 45 min-then went another 15 min. On a cookie sheet on top of pam sprayed cookie rack. Came out delish! Was pretty easy,and compared to my first time straight on the sheet-no soggy or mushy! On 2nd round-A keeper-give it 5 *****

I made this recipe and it was good.  The second time I made it I seasoned the chicken first with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and tumeric.  I also used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.

Really good! Was skeptical but the chicken was moist and the skin was crunchy and tasty. Next time I will try the healthier choice and remove the skins before cooking.

This was very good.  I did change it slightly to accommodate my own taste.  Mixed the mayo with a little yogurt ranch dressing and some milk to think it a bit.  Also used a mix of Panko breadcrumbs and seasoned breadcrumbs.  Added a little salt and pepper and paprika to the breadcrumb mix.  Overall very nice recipe.

I skipped the thyme but used all the other seasonings.  My children don't think I can make good fried chicken, but they loved this recipe!  I never buy mayo but had Miracle Whip so I dumped about a cup in a big pan, whisked it with milk to a less "gloppy" consistency, then coated each piece of chicken.  I let them "marinate" like that in the same pan for about an hour.  I then rolled them in the seasoned breadcrumbs and baked for 1 hr 20 min @375.  The coating was crispy & delicious and the chicken was juicy and moist.  I will be relying on this recipe for the future.  (I made 9lbs of chicken pieces so I tripled the recipe for crumbs, salt & paprika but only doubled the garlic and black pepper.  For the garlic powder I used 1 tsp garlic powder & 1 tsp onion powder since I prefer the milder flavor of onion.)

I made this following the suggestion to thin the mayo a bit. I only added enough milk to make it easier to coat the chicken, just a tablespoon or two. I also used Panko bread crumbs and skinless chicken. My whole family thought this was really bland and my kids complained it was slimy, though only the bottoms were from touching the pan. The exposed Panko was crunchy enough, it just didn't have much flavor. Edible, but I won't be making it again. And a big waste of mayo. I only used 1/2-3/4 of what the recipe asked for and still had a bunch left over. Also had leftover breadcrumbs and my chicken was almost 4lb.

This was delicious!  We've been trying to find an alternative to classic fried chicken and this was it!  My husband called it the winner and my kids liked it too.  I took the advice of others and mix 1/2 cup of mayo with 1/3 c. of half & half (but milk would work too) and about 2-3 tablespoons of ranch dressing.  For the breading I used homemade bread crumbs and added in a garlic herb mixture and some sea salt.  Absolutely amazing!  We will definitely be making this again.

So good!  Without this recipe I would have never thought about mayo and "fried" chicken.  I used the mayo as directed (with chopped garlic and eyeballed the amount, if it seems like too much simply use less) and did not have any issues.  As another review noted, use your hands here and it goes on fine.  Adding milk to the mayo may be nice but hardly seems necessary and I had no issues with oil or sogginess (I used skinless breasts, directly on foiled cookie sheet pan).  I used crushed Ritz and my own seasonings (cayenne, pepper flakes, chilli powder w/ garlic, paprika, Itailian mix, old bay, parmesan cheese), including the addition of hot sauce, which I dashed over the mayo.  I cooked frozen breasts at 400 for an hour (no turning, gas stove - mine cooks fast).  So tasty!  Could it have been crunchier, sure, but I wouldn't have mentioned it had I not read the reviews because it was that good.  The key is to season to taste and the mayo.

Just tried this and chicken is delicious, I used seasoned herb crutons instead of breadcrumbs and a mix of lite ceasar salad dressing and mayo with a few dashes of hot sauce. But can someone please tell me how to keep the coating on the chicken?  As I was taking the chicken off of the rack the coating was falling off.

Using boneless/skinless thin-sliced chicken breasts, I simply eyeballed the ingredients, including spices. I used a combo of Italian bread crumbs and panko, which is my personal preference. It provides that crispy, "fried" texture/taste. To the mayo mixture, of which I used far less than 1 c, I added some garlic powder, black pepper, poultry seasoning and maybe 1/8 c parmesan cheese.  I also added a few shakes of poultry seasoning to the bread crumb/panko mixture. Instead of adding salt to the dry ingredients, I simply sprinkled a bit of sea salt atop my chicken breasts. Instead of dirtying a baking dish, I lined a baking sheet with parchment paper, which I always do when baking chicken. Since I always buy the thin-sliced breasts, I only need 20 minutes at 400, which always renders perfectly done chicken. Of course, depending on the type of chicken you prepare and how hot your oven runs, the baking time/temp should be adjusted accordingly. While my chicken was baking, I whipped up some mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Easy, fast, and kid-friendly, this will be made when I need a quick weeknight dinner.

I did not have bread crumbs so I used crushed Mrs. Cubbisons stuffing.  That is the only change I made.  Had a good flavor.

This recipe was great! I only changed a couple things.. rather than use mayo to get the bread crumbs to stick I cracked an egg in a bowl and added a little water. It's a bit healthier that way.. I also left out the salt to cut down the sodium and used italian bread crumbs. I like a little bit of a kick so I added a little bit of cayenne pepper.. I'll definitely be making this again!

Really good chickn. Instead of normal mayo, I used half regular and half cracked peppercorn for a little added taste. It was really juicy and my husband loved it, will make again :)

this was awesome! I made a few changes, crushed 1/2 sleeve of Ritz crackers and added to breadcrumbs. Also added 1 teas onion powder and substituted lemon pepper for regular. Added 1/4 cup buttermilk to mayo, made it easier to handle. I was able to do 12 pieces of chicken, excellent!

This was excellent! So flavorful! As suggested by other reviewers, I used half mayo and half milk to coat the chicken, and also dredged in flour before doing so. Also, I didn't have a whole chicken or regular bread crumbs on hand, so I used chicken breast and panko crumbs and baked at 400 for 20 min. It came out perfect! Will def. make again!

Great chicken, the ONLY thing I changed was using 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup ranch and buttermilk to make it easier and I poured this over the chicken in a gallon zip lock to soak in the fridge for a few hours. I also used Panko chipolte bread crumbs. The best oven fried chicken we've ever eaten. Thanks for the recipe

I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. The only change I would make is less salt. It was a little too salty for my taste.

After going through some of the reviews, I decided to cook the chicken at 375 degrees for 45 minutes and 400 degrees for 15 minutes. This seemed to work well in giving it the "fried chicken" look. I didn't think that mayo on baked chicken would taste good but you don't even taste the mayo. It just makes it juicier! I did run into a problem with the coating.. the first half that I put down did not stick! A lot of it came right off.. maybe it's due to too much mayo. All in all the recipe was very tasty. I also used italian bread crumbs.

Moist inside and the breading stays on with each bite unlike pan fried chicken where all the breading pulls off when you take a bite.  Like that this recipe was healthy and simple and didn't create a huge mess in the kitchen. Plan to keep using this recipe but needs more spices to liven it up. Still pretty good though

Holy cow, this is good! Technically, I made Oven Fried Rabbit. Since rabbit doesn't have skin or any intramuscular fat, you really have to be careful so it doesn't get too dry. This recipe made nice, moist fried rabbit.   I substituted saltine crackers for the bread crumbs and omitted the salt. The kids and wife thoroughly approved. This is going to be a staple in my kitchen!

AWESOME  I have always shied away from doing fried chicken but not anymore. This was the BEST chicken my family and I have tasted. I made extra for leftovers but when dinner was done there wasn't any left. I did like some others suggested and did 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup milk. This is definatly a keeper and better than fast food chicken.

Moist and flavorful chicken!  I used ranch dressing because I was low on mayo, and I think it probably had more flavor because of that.  We liked it a lot.

This is sooooo good! Me and my husband love it.  The only thing I would suggest is that while baking it is a good idea to turn over the chicken once to ensure the coating gets crispy on either side.

I thought it was good but I didn't put the thyme either and added cayenne, put it on cooling rack on a cookie sheet but the bottom stuck and half the breading peeled off.  Next time I'll try turning it over half way through and see if it helps.  I used way less mayo too like other reviewers and real lite mayo not miracle whip.  I will also try panko next time.  I cut into tenders skinless breasts and liked that a lot.  It was fast easy and not greasy.  Served with broccoli and butternut squash and was a hit.

I changed this up a bit, using a mixture of whole milk and ranch (half of each) instead of the mayo. Also, I made my own breadcrumbs with some bread I baked a couple days earlier that needed to be used. Overall, this is a really great base recipe that will take well to a lot of variation.

Definitely don't use salad dressing instead of mayo - too sweet otherwise.  Also, coating was only crispy right out of the oven.  After it cools, it's soggy.

Hubby liked, I wasn't so sure. Mine wasn't very moist and the coating was really dry. I'll probably try again in case I made it wrong the first time, but there's not really a lot of ways to mess this up.

My family and I loved this. Kinda made my own mayo base - mayo on one side, Cardini's ceaser on the other. Ran out of breadcrumbs so I used 1/2 bread crumbs, 1/2 crushed Ritz crackers. YUM!

Yum!  This was a great dinner recipe and even BETTER the next day, cold. Would taste great cold and sliced on a salad.  I will make it again.  Only 4 starts because 1 cup mayo is WAY too much (I used less than 1/2 cup) and because it needed 10-15 minutes more in the oven.  I will make this again.

This was excellent.  I made it for a cookout.  I used chicken drumsticks and as others suggested I used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and thinned it out with milk. I also used half panko breadcrumbs and half Progresso Parmesan breadcrumbs.  My husband liked it so much that we're having it again tonight.  Two days in a row!  This time I will be using boneless breasts for Sunday family dinner.

My family didn't care for this recipe, some said it was bland other said they just didn't like the bread crumbs. I tried this despite not caring much for anything made with bread crubs for a breading/topping, it didn't change my mind. I won't make this again.

Tasty, quick, and easy recipe to take for potlucks or when you have a group of people over. I used Italian flavoured breadcrumbs and it gave an extra kick in terms of flavour. Turning up the heat to 375F was perfect. I used drumsticks with bones and skin and it took exactly 45 min. Not a healthy option, but the convenience factor and the taste makes it a good treat.

This came out very moist.  Did use half mayo and half milk. Have made this twice already with different seasonings. ****new info I have made this with full amount of mayo and it really came out very very good. From now on will be using the recipe as written no changes.

This chicken was a hit!  I used 1/2 cup mayo, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup milk for the coating.  I also used Planko instead of bread crumbs.  I cooked on 375 for 45 minutes and the outside of the chicken was crispy but the inside was still tender.

2 out of 5 of us asked for this not to be made again.  I think the salt/thyme combination was too much for them.  The chicken was very juicy and tender.  I think if I were to make it again, I would eliminate the salt.  I personally found the flavor to be quite addicting!

An OK recipe - nothing special.  The white meat turned out too dry....the thyme needs to be reduced by one half.

Followed the directions religiously except for increasing the oven temp to 375 as several suggested. The consensus in my household was this is a very pedestrian recipe: adequate, but nothing to distinguish it from dozens of similar treatments, many of which - including commercial preparations - we regard as far tastier.

This recipe was really good. We made a few changes but nothing major. We used panko bread crumbs and cooked it a little longer, probably because we used legs. I will use a little less salt next time and more paprika but other than that it was spot on.

Wow!  This chicken is so tasty and so easy!  I use Ian's italian panko bread-crumbs and I kick it up a notch with a little cayenne.  Aside from that I follow the recipe.  Thanks so much!  With some mashed potatoes and a big fat salad, this is a meal that we make at least once a month!

This was o.k. at best.  I made it exactly as written.  The thyme was overwhelming.  The chicken was moist and I was able to use the leftovers the next day in a chicken salad.

Great recipe! I didn't have enough bread crumbs, so I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup cornflake crumbs. I used chicken breasts and cut the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup. This turned out super moist and tender. Will definately make again!

I use 2-4 skinless/boneless breasts with just about 2 tablespoons of mayo and Panko breadcrumbs.  So juicy, crunchy, and healthy!   Note:this is one of those reviews that prompt a "just post this recipe" response from my husband as its is almost completely different, but I just had to give props to the use of mayo!

Well like so many others I too took the advice of others and used ritz crackers that I threw in my food processor and turned into bread crumbs. Our family and friends were totally blown away by this dish. You should have seen the look on everyone's faces when they were told that I used mayo to hold the crust together.

I knew that mayonnaise would be the secret to tenderness the moment I read this recipe! Consider that mayonnaise is essentially only oil and egg yolk.  That's a lot better than putting chicken into hot oil or especially LARD (which makes the crispiest fried chicken and the best of the best pie dough).  But lard is so unhealthy.  

I cut down the amount of mayonnaise to 1/2 C and then added a touch more when I saw it would not coat the THIGHS that my roommate and I prefer over other parts of the chicken.  

What I loved most was using my mixture of bread crumbs:  I use 1/2 Italian seasoned with 1/2 whole wheat crumbs, which makes the flavor very rich.  So rich, in fact, that all the other spices except for paprika and pepper can be cut in half.

UMMMMMMMM, this was great! I especially liked giving my roommate skinless thighs, her favorite, with no loss in moisture/tenderness, as well as that she needs softer foods thanks to having to remove her dentures.  Its inherent tenderness made it so easy for her to chew it!

I agree with the other review which said the cook time should be bumped up. Otherwise this recipe was GREAT. I've never had a chicken that was juicier!

This was AWESOME with a few minor modifications.

1 cup mayo was too much......start with 1/2-3/4C and add more if you need to. 

I added onion powder to the bread crumb mix and seasoned salt and pepper to the mayo.


Bake at 375 for 1 hour on a rack to insure crispness.

This recipe is great!  It will get rave reviews from your family.  I believe that removing the skin before "dipping" & "rolling" will make it healthier and a little less greasy.  Either way, it is excellent and quick!

It turned out moist and flavorful, but didn't taste anything like fried chicken. I baked it on a cookie rack as suggested to help keep it from getting soggy, which actually worked quite well. Good recipe, just not a good substitute for fried chicken, in our opinion.

This was good, but not great.  Used a wire rack, but still not crispy enough for my family's taste.  Flavor was good and it was super easy.

We loved this. I was a little put off by the mayo but i think it helped make the chicken moist. The only thing i did differently was i used half bread crumbs and half panko it was really good!

I think this may be the first time I've tried a recipe completely as written...and it was really a great basic recipe for oven fried chicken!  Really juicy and pretty good crust.  Will try again.

I love this recipe. It is great. I use boneless/skinless chicken breasts and instead of thyme and paprika i use lemon pepper. I only use about a half cup mayo like another review said. I think we've ate this 4-5 times in the last 2 weeks. Awesome. Thank you.

Well I thought this recipe was more work than it was worth.  "Painting" the mayo/ranch mixture on was messy, and I just didn't think the effort was worth the end result.  I did like baking it though as opposed to the mess of frying in grease.  My husband loved it, but I think I'll try something else next time.

Yummy!  Very tasty.  I mixed ranch dressing in with the mayo.  I used crushed ritz crackers, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and chili pepper for the coating.  I followed the advice of the people who suggested placing the chicken on a cooling rack with a cookie sheet under it and I didn't have any mushiness at all.

Very easy to make, the Mayonnaises held the coating very well. I used Chicken thighs with the skin on and added a little Caesar dressing to the Mayo. The chicken was moist and tasty. After 45 minutes the coating was just starting to crisp. I will make it again but increase the temperature to 375 fro the 45 minutes

Sorry, but I really didn't find this recipe very tasty. I made it with skin-on chicken thighs. The coating wasn't crispy, rather mushy. And there was an odd sweet taste - perhaps from the thyme? Having eaten plenty of real fried chicken and even Shake-n-Bake when I was a kid, this recipe is nowhere near comparable. While I did save the leftovers, I should probably just throw them out since I don't think they'd get eaten.

This wasn't fried chicken exactly, but it was pretty close. I used boneless skinless breast tenderloins. I used a mixture of mayo and whole milk and all the breading stayed on the chicken. I cooked it at 375 for about 45 minutes, and then turned up the heat to 450 for 15 minutes to get the chicken crispier (it wasn't crispy at all before despite being in the oven for 45 minutes). It was nice and crispy on the outside and very tender and moist on the inside. We all loved it and I will make again. Next time I will add extra spices though--the breading was a little bland for my taste. Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this on crinkled foil but it still came out slightly soggy. I'm a big crispy skin fan so that was a turn off for me. The flavor was good, but the consistency was not that of fried chicken.

We used 4 bone in chicken breasts for frying and this turned out really well. We did have to make more of the bread crumb mixture because the amount listed only covered 2 breasts. We also added some of the same seasoning to the mayonaise to give the chicken more flavor. Used chili powder instead of paprika because I didn't have any on hand. Very flavorful, moist and crunchy chicken. Cooked for 1 hour. Thanks for the recipe.

I used about 4lbs. of chicken for this recipe, 2.5t of granulated garlic instead of the powder, and 1/2c of light mayonnaise (which was plenty). I salted the meat (by eye, no measurement) before coating it so I omitted the 1t salt from the coating mixture. I broiled the chicken but I don't recommend it because the coating got brown before all the chicken was fully cooked. Next time, I'll just bake it at 375 degrees. Anyway, the chicken was good but could probably use the addition of more/other seasonings for more flavor.

This is very messy to make, but well worth it. Low fat mayo works great and I usually go a little lighter on the salt.

This was very good. I did use some additional seasoning, onion powder and oregano. The only reason that I am only giving this 4 stars was because the breast came out a little dry otherwise it was a keeper. Thanks for posting.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I think it will be added to our menu regulary. I used boneless skinless thighs and since I was without parsley tried basil. Yum!

The chicken was very tender.  The Mayo was pretty messy.  Next time I won't use such a thick layer of mayo on the chicken before it put it in the breading.  I will probably add more seasoning too...

Very good, much better than shake n bake. I used 3 boneless chicken breasts, so 1/2 cup mayonnaise went a long way. I probably could have halved the bread crumb mixture as well. I'll keep this one for sure!

it was pretty easy to make, and tasted fairly good. Good to make when you don't want the fuss of frying, and using too many bowls and dishes. I only had one bowl to wash, cuz I breaded the chicken in a ziplock bag, and baked in an oiled, aluminium foil lined baking dish! Good recipe.

I have switched to only using skinless chicken breasts for cooking, which makes most chicken dinners an adventure in dryness.  This was unbelievably moist!  My husband made comments on how moist and good it was at least three times during the meal, and he's one of those men who rarely says anything unless you ask him outright.  I used low fat mayo for health reasons, so can only imagine what whole fat mayo would do for it.  This is my new standard for oven fried chicken.  Thank you.

I changed a few things with this recipe, and we loved it.  I combined the mayo with a bit of spicy mustard for some extra kick, used Italian spices and added some ground pecans to the breadcrumbs.  Boneless, skinless chicken breasts came out very moist with a crispy coating.

Although we took a few liberties with this recipe it was very good.  Almost out of mayo, I made up the difference with caesar dressing, and almost out of breadcrumbs, I made some out of caesar croutons.  It was moist and flavourful, we'll make it again for sure.

I made this last night using chicken drumsticks.  I turned the oven up to 400 for the last 15 minutes and turned the meat over during that time to get the coating more crunchy.  The meat was so juicy and tender, but we didn't care for the breadcrumb coating so much.  It tasted so-so, but it reminded us of Chicken Parmesan more than Fried Chicken.

I made this the night before with an intent to take on a picnic - turned out to be too mushy for that.  Spices didn't quite sit right with me either - might try it again if I can eat it right away .

my family didnt like this recipe :( i liked the coating although it didnt remind me of fried chicken. husband thought it was bland and didnt eat it after two bites. however next time i might try this on drumsticks instead of boneless chicken breasts which is what i used today.

Elizabeth, where have you been all our lives?  This recipe is delicious.  The spices are a beautiful blend together (although I had to adjust the salt for our own taste to 1/2 ts.).  This is a 5-star YUM!

I drastically changed the recipe...  I never heard of using mayonaise to help coat the chicken, I used this method and it was excellent with a flour and my personal seasoning.  I'm sure it is just as excellent with the original ingredients and I will try it.  I usually don't keep bread crumbs on hand.  Thanks for the inspiration!

This was a very easy and very tasty way to oven-fry chicken. I did not have any thyme and added 1/2 teaspoon of oregano instead. I also added some onion salt and it came out perfect. Very crispy and flavorful. Even my 4 year old liked it!

It was pretty tasty, but not as crispy as I would have liked.  I did use corn meal instead of bread crumbs so that might have  been the reason.

This is a great recipe and thank you Elizabethfor sharing it to us. I did marinate thechicken in yogurt for 30 minutes as I had a lot in the fridge and it turned out execellent! My husband asked me why I didn't make more. Will make again this week. We can't wait.

I actually made this a little while ago but I'm on a reviewing kick this afternoon, so I thought I'd add positive remarks to this recipe.  Definitely use the ziplock bag!  But this came out great.  It was the first type of oven fried chicken I've ever made, so I don't know for sure that the mayo was the key to its goodness, but I do know I won't need to be shopping around for any other oven fried chicken recipes to try!  Tasted great.

Tasty but not crispy at all.  I think it was too much mayo.  Chicken was moist but I had advertised it to my dinner guests and "Oven Fried Chicken"...tasted like "Breaded Baked Chicken".  I might give it one more shot though with less mayo and maybe turn the oven temp up at the end to try for more crispness.

This chicken dish came out very moist. I used legs and thighs and it was good.
