This cookie dough is a bit too dry to work with.  The cookies are very fragile, even after cooling completely.  I felt like it was more of an add for Reynold's than an actual functional good recipe. Would not recommend.

I loved these cookies and that is saying something for a non sugar cookie lover. I admit I did not follow directions as listed. I did substitute vanilla bean paste for vanilla. I was out and did not want to go to the store. I did double the amount of vanilla because I wanted that extra bump of flavor! I creamed the butter and sugar till it was a very and I mean very light yellow almost white! This to me made a difference. I used all exact measurements other then the vanilla. The dough was crumbly at first. I took the dough out of the bowl and ran it in circles on the counter till it formed a nice ball with no crumbs falling off. Maybe about 1 min. I cut in to two smaller balls I flattened into a disk wrapped with plastic wrap and put into fridge for 20 min. When I took the first out to roll between the parchment it was easy, mess free. The cookies baked about 5-7 min. till they was just turning brown on the edges. I took them out and let cool. They puffed nicely did not spread much. They had a great vanilla, buttery flavor. About my baking time I always take my cookies out about 1-2 min before what is called for because like all things even cookies keep cooking even when they are removed from heat at first. This also helps me keep my cookies softer longer. I'm only giving it 4 stars due to my change of vanilla. Also mix the flour on low or fold in till incorporated. Don't over mix it!

Such a good recipe!! These did NOT last long at all. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and made mine into thumbprint cookies using spiced plum jam.

These cookies were great! I did use 2 eggs and 1/2 tsp. lemon extract. I did not chill the dough, it rolled out great w/o chilling. I love the parchment paper to roll out (no extra flour needed!)I brought them to ladies card night and they went fast. Will definetly make again.

I made these cookies as directed in the recipe, even though I had doubts due to the other reviews. The dough was very hard to work with and roll out. In the end, I gave up trying to make cut-out cookies and instead rolled the dough into balls with my hands and flattened them out into colorful circles. After the cookies were baked they had a nice flavor, but were very dry.
I am an avid baker and I don't suggest this recipe. If you are planning to make it, definitely take the advice of the reviewers who tweaked this one. Use whole eggs, and a bit less flour.
The Reynold's Parchment paper really was the saving grace for these cookies. I think they would have been burned or been too fragile if they were baked on an unlined cookie sheet. They had perfectly browned bottoms and slid right onto the cooling rack, thanks to the parchment.

The dough is so difficult to work with. I couldn't use the cookie cutters on it and they were pretty bland to taste. I prefer the rolled sugar cookies on this site that contain Cream cheese. Those are really easy to work with cookie cutters.

These worked great for me.  It's important to chill the dough in a flat disc, and then when you're ready to roll and cut the cookies, allow it to rest at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes after removing from the fridge.  This prevents the dough from being too crumbly while rolling.  Using Reynold's parchment paper to roll them out meant no sticking, and almost no cleanup. I loved the taste, they aren't too sweet which means you can add icing and candy and not get a crazy sugar rush!  My girls loved them too!

I followed the recipe exactly, but scaled it to 18 cookies.  I did sift my flour before I measured the amount stated and I thought the dough was a bit too soft at room temperature, but that was easily remedied by keeping the unused portion in the fridge and then chilling it again before separating the cut outs .  I was pleasantly surprised by how delicate and buttery they turned out.  Oh, I did replace the vanilla extract with lemon, but that shouldn't have made any difference.

I agree with the other reviewers - the proportions seem to be a bit off for these.  I ended up adding the egg whites because the batter was too shaggy, then it ended up being too soft.  I chilled it for the time in the recipe, and the dough was too sticky to hold its shape.

I ended up rolling these into a log and sliced it into cookies and made them into egg shapes for Easter cookies.  Easier than cutting cookies but I was hoping to make some shapes.  The Reynolds parchment made both baking and cleaning up after decorating a snap, though.

I loved this recipe! I used imitation vanilla extract due to my husband's allergy, and it was wonderful. Also, he's highly allergic to egg whites, so it was nice to have a recipe that called for egg yolks instead. No itchy tongue for him! And my daughter loved making these cookies for Santa. So easy and simple. The only thing I did differently was add an extra teaspoon of imitation vanilla extract so that it wasn't so bland. These make excellent frosted or iced sugar cookies. Two thumbs up!

My granddaughters really enjoyed these.  Based on others reviews that the dough was dry and crumbly, I used the full 2 1/2 cups of flour and two whole eggs.  The dough was a bit soft but rolling between the sheets of parchment worked really well.  Once the dough was chilled it was easy enough to work with.  I love the rolling and baking on parchment, it works great and makes for easy clean up too!

These are a nice, buttery cookie, but the ingredient  amounts are off.  After reading the reviews, I followed the other reviewers' suggestion to use 2 cups of flour and that worked out well.

The taste of these cookies is amazing with the change I made (using brown sugar AND white sugar rather than just the white).  These were so good, they didn't even need frosting, though they wouldn't taste bad with it either.  My cookies were difficult to roll because the dough was sticky, so I just spooned them onto parchment paper like drop cookies.  They spread quite a bit in the oven (I didn't have enough time to refrigerate them for the full hour), but they were delish.  My husband tried one a few days later and said it was so moist that it tasted as if it had just come out of the oven.

Yummy cookies.. I found two cups of flour to be the perfect amount, with a little bit more sprinkled on the parchment when rolling out. I rolled out half the dough at a time, keeping rest in fridge chilling. It worked really well rolling the dough out in the parchment.. never done this before

I didn't like this recipe.  For me (a non baker) I followed the recipe as written and it was so dry and crumbly.  My second batch wasn't much better.  I added the entire 2 eggs to see if that helped, and it did, some.  At least these could be rolled out.  The taste was really just ok to me.  My SIL, who is a baker, tried his hand on the THIRD batch and he said NEVER again.  He will stick to his go to recipe. I really wanted these to turn out nicely, thus the 3 batches, but the expense alone on this one was enough to just say next time, I'll try another recipe.
On a completely different note, the Reynolds Parchment paper worked like a charm and I had NO problems with that part.

The overall problem seems to be the amount of flour. That's what creates a dry/crumbly dough. I chose to scale the flour to an even two cups, and added it to the creamed butter mixture 1/4 cup at a time. It worked beautifully! I followed the remaining recipe exactly. There is no need to add the egg white, as this will create a cookie that is drier.

This gets barely a one from me. I could not roll these to save my life. They were like a shortbread crumb. I packed them into an 8x8 pan for a crust and cooked up a banana pudding for a filler and served with cut fresh bananas and whipped cream. I baked this crust for 15 mins. Family enjoyed it and didn't know the difference. This one is scratched from my list for sure.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever had!  Yes, the dough was a little difficult to work with after it chilled but I simply cut it in half, let it sit out for a few minutes and was able to roll it out just fine.  The cookies were not fragile and they taste amazing!

It was too dry!  I had to add another egg to it to even get it to make a ball to refrigerate. I found it still a bit hard to roll out.  I will not be making this again!

I cannot give 5 stars because I made changes to the cookies. I used less flour (2 cups total) and more sugar (1 cup total). I used half of the vanilla it called for and used 1 whole egg + 1 egg yolk. With these alterations, the cookies turned out great! I did bake them twice as long as called for (as some ovens vary). My mom and I made an icing consisting of powdered sugar, butter, milk, and a bit of vanilla and finished the iced cookies off with sprinkles. The parchment paper helped for an easier clean-up.

Very good recipe. Nice texture and flavor, but they seemed a bit crumbly compared to the other recipe I use on ARC. I did use the Reynolds Parchment for chilling, rolling and baking. No mess in the kitchen or on me!

As others have done, I used two whole eggs and ended up adding more flour until I reached a good rolling consistency.  Just for something a little different, I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and was pleased with the flavor.  I did have to work fast between batches, as the dough softened quickly making it sticky.  I baked one pan at time, and put the dough in the fridge between batches.  The texture was spot on, and the cookies were tender.

These turned out good. At times I can be a bumbling fool when it comes to baking cookies so I read all of the reviews. I used a whole egg and when the dough mixture looked to be the right consistency for rolling I stopped adding the flour mixture to keep it from drying out. I used "Sugar Cookies Icing" here on AR to ice them.

These are good! After reading the reviews, I opted to add the whole egg instead of just the yolk, and that worked out fine. I tinted the dough green for my St. Patrick's Day shamrock cut outs. These did not spread, which I liked and just sort of 'puffed' slightly. This is a nice, basic dough with a good buttery flavor. Thanks for sharing. :)

Waaaaaay to dry I added the egg whites to it just so it wouldn't be a powder they are in the fridge now dough is a bit plain but that's ok I don't like really sweet cookies
