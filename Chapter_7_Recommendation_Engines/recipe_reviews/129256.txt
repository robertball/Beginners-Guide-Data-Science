I had something similiar to this at Barrio Cafe in Pheonix.  The chef added red onion and lime juice.  So I altered this recipe to incorporate those items: 2tsp minced red onion and juice of 1/2 lime.  The chef also put pomegrante seeds on the top for extra punch.  So good with tortilla chips!

Great for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I boiled fresh cranberries with about a cup of water and some sugar and mashed them to get a compote. Stirred that into the guacamole before serving--it came out great! I'd be interested to try it with something fresher than a salsa verde, though.

I forgot to buy the salsa verde, and left out the jalapeno for the non-spicy eaters. It turned out quite well, and was very pretty with the red cranberries against the fresh green avocados. It went perfectly with the Pumpkin Black Bean Soup also found on on this site.
