I've been making this recipe for years as well, one of the tricks is that you have to blend the cream cheese and pears for a very long time. It should be totally smooth. I have always used lime jello and I use dream whip instead of frozen whipped topping. It disappears quickly every timey.

I make this with strawberries and strawberry jello. My husband doesn't like pears so this is perfect for us! I have had the pears and nuts and it is great! I'd reccomend using any kind of fruit and jello to make it your own!

This is a great recipe although the picture of the green salad has absolutely nothing to do with this recipe.

This is pretty yummy! My sister in law made this recipe and brought it to a family dinner and everyone in the family has been asking for this jello every family dinner since! There are never left overs because it goes so quickly! Now, when we plan family dinners, someone asks, "So who is making the green jello?" It's light and creamy, like a dessert jello. My family loves it!

My family has also been making this for years, although without the nuts, and we've always called it "Green Monster", making it with the lime jello, of course. Our biggest trick, is to put the cream cheese and pears in the blender, and mix them there, then add the jello, blend again, and finally fold in the cool whip.  That way you get a really nice smooth texture.

Have loved this recipe for years.  Try it with lime jello and it is even better.  Nice frosty green color.  Marvelous taste.

After reading this recipe I printed it out and decided that I would make it within the week. After I made it, I was quite disappointed. It was 'okay', but definitely not something I'd prepare for guests, or take to a potluck hoping that everyone would love it, etc.The fact is that there's nothing very striking or impressive about it. I would prefer some zip, some sparkle, some zing. This salad could almost be called bland. I won't be making it again.

I loved this pear salad, too, as did all my friends and family.  What a great combination of flavors.  I couldn't stop eating it!  It will definitely be added to my recipe collection!

I've been making this for a couple of years now and it's always a big hit with my family.  The texture is so satisfying and the flavor is divine.  Take this geletan salad to a party and watch it disappear.

People always LOVE this if they try it!  It's not much to look at (I've had someone ask if it was a potato dish before... hello) ;)

I've always used real whipping cream in my recipe vs. cool whip.

I wanted mine to look like the pic so I changed the recipe. I made one pkg of 3 oz lime jello, and put 1/3 of the can of chopped pears in it.  I let it set up and made the light green portion as the recipe stated.  (3 oz lime jello, 2c whip cream, cream cheese, 1 c syrup, pears, I eliminated pecans).  It was delicious and easy to serve.  My pic is posted  on a crystal plate to see how I it turned out.

I used my food processor to mix  all the ingredients (no pecans). First mixed cream cheese and drained pears in food processor. Second used lime jello and  follow  gelatin directions made sure it was very  cool before adding it to my cream cheese mixture, mixed it. Then added one tub 8 ounces of cool whip, mixed well. I didn't have a Gelatin mold, so used my 9x13 glass baking pan, I poured the cream cheese gelatin into the glass pan and put it in the refrigerator.

 The only additional change I made to this recipe, used a 6oz box of Lime Jello and followed directions on the box. Made sure the lime Jello  was very cool before I poured it on top of the cream cheese gelatin pan and back to the refrigerator. Wow!! It looked like the picture and it was delicious. And I had it for breakfast in the morning. LOL!!

In addition to this recipe, I added a layer of raspberry jello with canned cherries added.  Went over very well.

delicious but I didn't blend the pears and cream cheese until smooth and it came out lumpy.  Lumps of cream cheese is kind of gross.  I'm giving this five stars because it was my fault for the lumps and aside from the lumps the taste was very good.  I'm not sure what the trick is to make it smoother.  Any suggestions?

Long lost old recipe. We used strawberry jello. We renamed it 'Pink Stuff' so the kids would eat it and the gobble it up.

I have almost this same recipe but I use a quart of drained pears and only one cup of cool whip. I don't put nuts in mine.  I use lime jello as it looks  prettier that way.  Sometimes I use two small packages of jello to give it more flavor.  My family loves it!  We all think it is wonderful!!

When I was a young girl, my Aunt always made this salad for the holidays.  We always had jello back then.  You don't see them at dinners too often anymore.  I would not like the pecans in mine.  They would get too soggy in no time.  This is a very tasty Jello mold.

I made this recipe twice now and everyone loved it.  I actually like using orange jello and mandarin oranges.  I used a 6 oz package of orange jello and 2 of the 15 oz cans of Mandarin oranges.  I blended 8 oz. of cream cheese with an 8 oz carton of cool whip and one can  of the drained mandarin oranges.  I used the juice of both cans of oranges and a little bit of water to make 2 cups, boiled it and dissolved the jello.  The extra can of oranges was  added to the orange jello before it became firm.  Once the jello was firm in the bowl, I added the well blended cream cheese and cool whip- no nuts to the top of the firm jello.  This gives it the two layer look.  Very pretty in a clear bowl !

It was a hit at our last meeting! I added a layer of just lime jello with pear chunks in it  to the bottom of the mold. Then put this recipe on top.

I think this recipe is wrong in proportion.  That is way too little Jell-O mix for the cream cheese and whipped topping.  I used a large box of Jell-O and it came out fabulously.  I also modified the recipe by using Orange Jell-O and mandarin oranges, and it got rave reviews.

This salad was great for Thanksgiving, now for Christmas I am making it without the pears (sorry) I love pears with mayonnaise and shredded cheese not so much in Jell-o.

This is a nice, light parfait type dish.  I made exactly as the recipe states, and enjoyed it for something a little bit different.  Thanks for the recipe, Lisa H.!

Such an easy and light dish! I've made it several times. My cousin who doesn't like Jello even devoured it and asked for more!
