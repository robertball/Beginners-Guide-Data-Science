This was great for the kids!  Even my picky 2 year old enjoyed this and she normally doesn't like eggs; she gobbled it right up!  My 5 yearold asked me for seconds and if I could make this for breakfast EVERY day lol. :D

Believe it or not, I've never made this before...feels like I'm the only one that hasn't!
Made this for hubby this morning and he loved it. I toasted the cirlce I cut out of the bread and put it on top of the egg before plating it.
Easy to make,had ingredients on hand and sure to please. I'll be making this one again.

I'm with TANAQUIL on this; this recipe is all over this site under several different names! I always knew it as Toad in a Hole. Always a lot of fun and a good recipe.

This was the only way my mom was able to get me to eat my eggs when I was a kid. :-) It's been ages since I've had eggs and toast this way, but now that I've seen this all over the site, I'm going to make it for old times' sake!

doesn't this remind you of growing up! anyway my tip is don't use jumbo eggs and remember to toast the cut-out also using cookie cutters is a great way to change the shape and keep it interesting for the kids

We called this a "Popeye Egg" at my house growing up... we would make it with a fried egg, rip off the crust, and dip it in the yolk.

I used whole grain wheat bread & I used a heart shaped cookie cutter. I did "toast" the heart piece & served it alongside. My grandsons & I enjoyed this but my year old granddaughter (who usually eats ANYTHING) tried to shove it off her high chair tray. LOL

Very good, a classic (I call it Egg in a Hole, since we all seem to have different names for it).  Here's an extra tip:  reserve the circle of bread.  Once you've cracked the egg into the hole, press the extra bread circle into the white of the egg (both sides of the bread).  Then cook the bread circle as you're cooking the "egg in a boat", and serve it with the circle on top of the yolk.  Yummy!  And PS to Sara Lee's marketing group:  you're doing great!  I've tried (and enjoyed) a few other Sara Lee recipes, and found myself looking for Sara Lee bread last time I was at the supermarket.  My store doesn't carry it, but I'll keep an eye out!  Thanks!
