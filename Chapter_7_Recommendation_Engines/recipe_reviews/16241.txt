A friend of mine gave me this recipe some years ago, but I lost it.  The difference was it didn't call for Vodka, but apricot brandy instead.  When I made it before, I bought peach schnapps, which worked quite well.  In fact, we decided not to make it a slush, but a punch.  Now that I've found the recipe again, I made it for a small New Year's Eve party last night, this time making the slush, and using wild berry schnapps.  Out of this world!  I'm not a drinker, so I like something a little sweet, but not too sweet.  This is perfect.  Thanks for giving the recipe back.  I'll be sure not to lose it this time.

A real party pleaser -- had them begging for more!  Best to make the night before the party to allow time to freeze (slush).

Very, very good! A little sweet for me, so I added extra ginger ale for my glasses. My guest and my boyfriend loved it, you can barely taste the booze (I couldn't at all actually) and that is what they like. Making this one again! Although next time I am going to try using more green tea; I could barely taste that except as a hint of aftertaste. To save on pans I brought all the water to a boil while stirring in the sugar, then turned off the heat and steeped the tea in the sugar water. No reason to do them separate!

This is such a fun recipe.  I have made a similar version for awhile using 2-3 cups of Brandy instead of the vodka.  If you use more than 3 cups the slushie will not freeze.  It is also fun to change up the juices used to create different flavors.  This is such a "girls night out" drink.

I thought this was great, but needs to have more alcohol per my guest.
