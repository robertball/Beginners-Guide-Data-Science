Tastes good but the ingrediants are way more than 4 servings. Works well for a potluck.

Made this for dinner and it hit the spot on a cold, rainy night. I added a little orange bell pepper with the onions, because I had that on hand. I also reduced the amount of salt. For us, the amounts of chili powder and cayenne were just right. I will make this again and throw out my other jambalaya recipes.

Made this for a crowd of college students and it got rave reviews. Awesome Mardi Gras recipe! Teamed it with the Mardi Gras slaw as a side dish.

This recipe turned out great. Instead of using ham, I used hot Italian sausage.

The chili powder didn't work for me in this but other than that this was pretty good. I did like the ham and shrimp combo. This recipe has potential but needs some tweaks in my opinion.
