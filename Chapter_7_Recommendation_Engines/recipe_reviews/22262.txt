I've made this cake on several occasions and it was a hit each time.  My only recommendation is to spare the honey dressing - if you use all that is recommended, you'll end up with honey soup with cake in it.  I typically use about half of what is prepared.

This recipe was easy!  I increased the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp. The flavors remind me of baklava.  The syrup was a little too sweet for my liking. Next time, I might reduce the amount of honey and sugar in half. This one is a keeper!

this came out just as amazing as I thought it would!  I added lemon zest instead of orange.  I cut the syrup recipe by half and I used mostly honey and about a quarter of the white sugar. Added like 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the syrup and it is just amazing!!!!! I used a round pan and it looks just like the main picture :) this will be made OFTEN!!!  I just ate 4 pieces!!  ***** This is an update!! this third time making this I decided to use honey instead of the sugar in the cake itself since the name is Honey Cake, not granulated sugar cake... it was so moist from this that I didn't need to add the milk.  For the syrup I used about a cup of honey with like 5 tablespoons (a splash) of orange juice and one tablespoon of sugar and it is so good!! the best one yet!

I love this easy to make cake that I found here on this website.  The first time I made it my husband said it tasted just like the cake him mother used to make!  What better compliment? (His mother was an outstanding greek cook!)

I brought this to a Greek themed dinner.  It was abig hit and easy to make.  I only had a 1/2 cup of honey so I halved the syrup.  I think it would have been way too sweet with the whole recipe.  Very tasty.

This was great!  I served it for my book club and it was a huge hit.  I omitted the nuts and it was still good.  Tastes like baklava.

I'm a tough grader -especially on desserts -but this was very good.  My parents and I just returned from a trip to Greece, so I decided to do a Greek dinner; my parents loved it.  Also, we thought it was better once cooled and great the next day.

Thank you, CALIFORNIADREAMING...I'm the submitter of this recipe, and THIS ISN'T A SUBSTITUTE FOR BAKLAVA (which is a pastry, not a cake). It's a Greek cake called Karithopeta, which is a walnut cake. The cake is supposed to soak up the syrup...you can buy it at almost any Greek food festival...it's meant to be very sweet & very moist. I'm happy that so many people are enjoying it!

This was a good cake and I enjoyed the simplicity, but probably won't resort to this again as a substitute for baklava.  I used whole wheat flour and pecans and added a splash of vanilla extract to the eggs since I didn't have the orange zest.  The cake was moist and had good flavor.  Nice to make when you don't have much time.  Thanks for sharing Jan.

It came out so good looking I had to try not eating it! After reading the reviews I decided to put some of the honey syrup in a container just in case someone wanted their's sweeter, I tell ya its mighty sweet with all that honey and sugar, don't be worry about puddles in the cake, the cake will soak up the honey syrup

This was great.  The only modification I made was not adding any sugar to the cake.  The syrup is enough sweetener.  The trick with this is you have to make it enough in advance to allow the syrup to be absorbed into the cake.  
This is NOT baklava, nor is it trying to be.  A lot of Greek desserts have both walnuts and honey in them.

Some of the reviews ridiculously subtracted points for  not  being a "substitute for baklava". It's not intended to be and the submitter never said that it was. Those that use whole wheat flour in this recipe should expect different results.

Yummy!  Yummy! This cake was so good. It was moist, rich and fluffy! I made it exactly to the recipe, it was easy, fast and yummy. Even the clean-up was easy. The only problem I had was trying not to eat too much!

WOE!! Great cake!! I love how the honey syrup is soak into this cake. I was excited about learning how to prepare a Greek dish. It almost reminds me of a banana nut bread, but alot more enhanced. At first I thought it was too sweet, but when I allow the syrup to soak long enough in the cake, I begined to enjoy it alot more. Looking forward to making it for family and friend in the future. Thanks alot!!

Lovely and easy.  I did not use the sugar in the syrup and replaced the water with a 50/50 mixture of fresh orange and lemon juice.  I served the cake with natural Greek yoghurt. Perfect!

This cake is very good, but also very sweet. It smelled so delicious baking in the oven that I couldn't wait to try a piece, but I suspect it will be better in the morning after it has cooled and the glaze soaks all the way into the cake. My only substitute was pecans for the walnuts...not authentic for baklava but it was all I had in the cupboard. I might try cutting out a little of the sugar in the glaze next time, although I suspect it will still be very sweet with all the honey. Very tasty though, and I will probably make it again.

Cooking time reduced to 25 minutes. After reading several other reviews, I halved the honey glaze as well (1/2c honey, 1/2c sugar, 1/2c water, tsp lemon juice). Turned out delicious, even my 4 year old who won't eat ANYTHING loved it!

Love this cake! Deliciously moist texture that melts in your mouth with a nutty bite.  Doubled the recipe; added walnuts,  almonds, lemon zest, orange juice to the batter and used an excellent syrup from a baklava recipe that I drizzled over the 10x15x1" cake pan after cutting it into diamond shapes. Even better the next day; the cake soaked up the syrup and we were addicted! Better than most coffee cakes--can be used to deliver almost any berries. Awesome RUMOR!

Exactly, Josie.  This is good, but certainly not a replacement for Baklava - though it is slightly reminiscent.  Didn't have oranges, so omitted the zest.  Upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  It is worth trying, but not enough to warrant a place in the paper recipe box.

Delicious.  Followed the recipe to the letter except for the soaking syrup.  Based on everyone's comments, I made half the recipe and found it to be plenty.  Moist, sweet cake with a subtle orange flavor.  Will definitely make again.

4 stars because I changed the recipe a bit. I took the suggestion of another cook and halved the syrup on top (1/2 of the honey, none of the sugar, and did not heat up), and poured it over when the cake was warm.  YUM!! YUM!!  This cake was very tasty and  I will make it again!

really excellent - I was happily surprised at how lovely this turned out.  I only added the cup of honey lemon juice  but no water or sugar plus this made it light and not too sweet.  I didn't have any nuts but will add them when I make again (which I am going to do this Monday) Thanks!!

I halved the honey syrup and still found this dessert to be disgustingly sweet.  It's like eating sponge that sopped up pure sugar water.

Very delicious! It's like a baklava cake. I also reduced the amount of syrup by half and was perfect. I think it would have been too sweet otherwise. I used lemon zest on the batter instead of orange.

Truly delicious!  Really does remind me of baklava except this is so much easier to make.  Because of a walnut allergy, I use pecans that I bake about five minutes as the oven is warming up and then chop.  I use an 8x11 1/2" glass cake pan which results in a height similar to baklava, so the pieces nicely soak up the honey syrup of which I use about 3/4 of the syrup recipe (with a bit more fresh lemon juice to cut the sweetness perfectly).  The rest of the syrup goes into a little pitcher for anyone who wants extra.  I love this recipe!

Very moist cake, but I put the walnuts in the processor and pulse them.  It sure tasted like the baklava I had at the fair.

Not bad.  It's certainly easy to make, and if you let the syrup soak in without freaking out (I almost did!  It just sort of puddled at first!), it just soaks into the cake and makes it sweet.  I see where people are coming up with the comparison to baklava--yes, the honey part does sort of remind me of it, but it's certainly not the same thing in terms of texture.  The cake is slightly dry and not the texture of baklava at all.  For all that, though, I kind of like it.  I halved the syrup and am very glad I did.  It might have all soaked in, it might not have, but it is just the right amount of honey sweetness for me (I don't have much of a sweet tooth).  It also doesn't make a lot, which is convenient to just try it out.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really like this recipe.  Easier than baklava and has a flavor of it's own.  It is a smallish, moist, dense cake, but that works well because it is quite rich.  I made it a day ahead.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to double the cinnamon and add a pinch of nutmeg.  I also took the suggestion to eliminate the sugar from the glaze one step further and (subbed orange blossom honey for regular) heated in the microwave for 30 seconds and then drizzled it straight from the bottle onto the individual pieces.  It worked well as then people were able decide for themselves how much they wanted and it was easy for me to prep and clean up.  Definitely give this one a try!

This is an excellent cake reminiscent of the Greek cookie finikia/melomakarona, but MUCH easier to prepare!  I adore the orange/cinnamon combination and will have to control myself from eating the rest of the cake on my own.  This was our dessert for tonight as it is Greek Easter and I wanted to make something special for my family.  I halved the syrup which was good, but I think more will be even better next time.  This recipe will become part of my regular dessert rotation--thank you for sharing it!  Kalo Pascha--Hristos Anestei!

My wife just raved about this recipe! As suggested by others, I cut the honey syrup in half. Next time I will make the full amount of syrup, pierce the cake with a fork and then pour the syrup over it.
I particularly liked the hint orange flavoring in the cake. Next time I think I will increase the amount of orange zest.

Loved this recipe!  Really simple and wonderfully moist.  I have to echo previous criticisms about the honey sauce, you need less than half what the recipe calls for, but the cake is wonderful.

Easy, tasty, and not too sweet, this cake was a hit at a work celebration.  I used only half of the honey syrup, as many reviewers recommended, and I think it had the right amount of sweetness.  I'm not a big fan of honey, so I gave this a four out of five, but it was a hit with co-workers.  You can use your lemon to make a zest garnish, as well.

We really like this cake. Served it at the end of a Greek meal and it was perfect. Used only half the amount of honey syrup, as other reviewers suggested, and that was the perfect amount. I like this much better than baklava, and will definitely make it again. Thanks!

Delicious!  I used whole wheat flour, halved the syrup, and used smart balance 50/50 butter blend.  The only thing I didn't like was that there really wasn't an orange or lemon flavor.  I think I'll use OJ instead of water and cut down some of the sugar for the syrup next time!

This was great. I didn't have enough honey, so I substituted 1/2 cup light karo syrup, and reduced the amount of water to 1/3 cup. I found the flavor to be just perfect, as it didn't have an overwhelming honey taste.It was nice and delicate, and I will make it again (and again) with these small adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I have made it several times, and I usually double the cinnamon and add a dash of nutmeg.  Sometimes (I'm an idiot) I begin assembling and forget that i don't have an orange.  In this case, I substitute orange juice for the milk.  Not quite as good but still delicious!  Definately half the sugar/honey/water at the end, though.  This is a dessert I crave frequently.  Thanks!

This was an excellent and easy cake recipe.  I added some vanilla extract in addition to the orange zest.  Since different family members like various degrees of sweetness, I spooned 1/4 of the honey syrup onto the warm cake.  Once I was ready to serve, a put the rest over syrup in a gravy boat and people added however much more they wanted.  I would recommend using orange blossom honey if you can find it; it helped bring out the orange-y perfume of the zest.

Wasn't sure if I had done it right with the puddling of honey at the bottom but a Greek woman where I work said it's exactly how it's suppose to be.  I cut it into thin slice (any bigger is too much) and was a big hit.

I followed reviewers suggestions to half the syrup & call me a pig, but I think it could have used some more. Probably not all of it but more than half. I didn't bother to cut this into diamonds...I just cut it into squares. I copied donalyn & poked holes w/ a toothpick before pouring the syrup over. I will make this again even when it's not a Greek themed meal....thanks.

Great cake, although more like a banana bread. I poked holes with a toothpick in the top of the cake and only used about 1/3 of the syrup. It was wonderful!

I made this recipe with Quinoa flour instead of all purpose and it came out great! I cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes because I wasn't sure how the quinoa flour would work for baking time--it was clearly done in 29 minutes. I cut the cake up in the pan and poured the syrup over the cake and served it driectly from the pan.
Using quinoa flour makes the cake gluten free and healthier than if I used white flour.  I also used half the syrup per other suggestions and it's fine.  Made it for a Greek-themed dinner party.

I made this cake for a Greek-food dinner party, and everyone loved it.  None of us had ever had it before, or heard of Karithopeta.  The only thing I changed a little was to use a half cup sugar and half cup water in the glaze.  Very moist!

A TRULY DECADENT DESSERT. I would cut down on the honey, almost by half. I had pecans on hand and it works just as well as walnuts. Great for dinner parties or gatherings.

Definitely halve the sauce. Even with a double dose it was very tasty, but too sweet for me. Rave reviews from the greek part of my family.

this came out well, but was more a way to use up some honey and walnuts. it was tasty, but not spectacular. i also halved the syrup recipe; my husband ate his cake without it anyway. i might make this again for a greek-themed meal, but probably not just for pleasure.

Very yummy! perfect for the occasion (greek dinner party).  I took the suggestion to double the orange zest and halve the honey sauce.  It was great and everyone loved it.

Made this for a Greek-themed dinner and it was a big hit.  Absolutely delicious and the only change I made was using orange zest from a jar rather than fresh.  They really do taste like baklava and are easy to make.

I made this rich cake at Easter for my family. It was dense and super moist and incredibly delicious. One small slice was the perfect serving size.

I loved this dessert! With the syrup, it was extremely moist and had an acidic taste. It tasted rather like baklava, but was far easier to bake!

This was good and fun to try. It was a little too sweet for me, but it did remind me of Baklava, so I might make it once and a while. It was better the second day.

Light delicate and citrusy I really enjoyed this recipe! I only put half the sugar in the honey syrup and did not pour the entire amount over the cake. I set most of the syrup aside to add later as you eat it.

This cake is amazing! I used a mix of olive oil and Greek yogurt instead of butter, and it was great. I also only used half the syrup and that was just enough for me. Thank you!

I made this recipe for a Greek theme party and was amazing! Everyone loved, no leftovers. I changed the the amount of sugar. I doubled the recipe so I use 1 cup of sugar for the cake and no sugar for the syrup. Instead I use fresh juice of an orange for the syrup and add pecans and almonds.
It was spongy, sweet, citrusy ??

My son requested a Greek meal for his birthday dinner and so we made this for his birthday cake.  I forgot to put the walnuts in but sprinkled them on top after the cake started baking.  Even so, it was amazing, tasted like baklava cake.  I did substitute a gluten free all-purpose flour with no problem and baked it in a 9" springform pan (which I placed on a deep serving plate before pouring the syrup in case the seal on the pan wasn't good).  So glad to have found something that tastes like baklava that's gluten free!

Perfect clean tasting and simple honey cake. The time was a bit long in my oven, but I enjoy more well done cakes, the crisp edges and firm bottom held up well to the honey syrup.  I made my syrup with 1.25c honey 0.5c water and a bit of orange zest because I needed to use up some crystalized honey, and was looking for a strong honey flavor.

This is a really great, easy, and quick dessert to make.  Even with the honey on top, it's not super sweet and heavy which is nice.  For the most part I made the cake exactly as written except I used lemon zest instead of orange zest because I didn't have any oranges on hand.  I also took the advice of the other reviewers and halfed the amount of honey topping and added it to the cake slices as I served it.  I think that's the perfect amount to give it some sweetness without being sickeningly sweet tasting.  I served it last night after a Greek inspired dinner and it was a perfect ending to the night. :)

I made this without any changes and was blown away with the flavor and texture. Given the fact that you make a sweetened honey lemon syrup and poor over the  cooked cake I was a little skeptical about  how sweet this would be. This cake is awesome and I will be making it again so I can share with guests and neighbors alike.

Incredibly light and moist cake, full of flavour and not too sweet on its own. The honey syrup is very sweet, so go easy! Made a double batch for a community lunch and it was gobbled up. Will be making this again!

AMAZING! I used honey instead of the white sugar and instead of milk, I just added a few large dollops of Greek Yogurt. I also skipped the orange flavor and went with all lemon. I squeezed a whole lemon in there as well as the lemon zest I could scrape off. For the topping, I did only the honey with a bit of water to burn off and again, more lemon juice. I only poured on 1/3rd as other readers said to watch the portioning. I jarred the rest and put on the table for others to add as they liked. I also topped it with some lemon zest and served it with a bit of Greek yogurt.

Very nice! I am not too fond of baklava because I find it too sweet--I can only handle one bite.  I was worried that this one would also be too sweet. To my surprise, it was just sweet enough. Unfortunately, it is not the prettiest cake. But it is so tasty, that it makes up for its lack luster. Everyone at my party was surprised about the rich favors that were not overbearing. People were asking to take leftovers home!

My husband loves this recipe as he has a sweet tooth, but after the first cake I halved the syrup recipe with a quarter of the sugar and it is still delicious.
I place the cake on a cake cooler and then pour the syrup over it so it does not soak up the excess.

I'd give this a higher rating, but I had to make a few changes. I increased the orange zest to 1 tablespoon, doubled the cinnamon and added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. I also halved the syrup(the full amount would have been way too much) and added 1 teaspoon of lemon zest. The cake only needed 30 min in my oven, not 40. With these changes and how easy it is to make I'll be making this cake frequently

I made this cake for my daughter's school project "Greek Food Day".  As usual she gave me NO notice that this project was due "tomorrow" so I had no time to make Baklava and I needed something in a hurry.  It worked out well because I had all the ingredients except walnuts on hand, so I omitted nuts altogether.  I used fresh orange zest and it gave the cake a heavenly flavor especially with the cinnamon!  I didn't have a full cup of honey so I cut the glaze recipe in half.  As it turned out, the full glaze recipe would've been way too much and half was just right.  I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't boil the glaze...seems strange to boil honey... and I just simmered it until the white sugar had dissolved.  I was a little disappointed in how small the cake was... it didn't rise much at all which was surprising since this little 9-inch cake calls for THREE eggs, baking powder and salt.  Aside from that, it was a good cake and the kids loved it.  I don't know that I'll make it again, but it was very good for what I needed.

I can barely taste the orange zest or the lemon juice, but I don't miss them.  I made and used all of the syrup called for, and I'm glad I did.  The syrup soaked down to the bottom where the walnuts are, and reminded me of baklava, which I love!

I cut the honey syrup in half like suggested, otherwise did not change anything.  My sons say, "Honey Cakes Rule!".

This was very good.  I'm not an experienced sugar/water syrupy type of cook, so I would have liked to know if I made my syrup right.  It could have been thicker, and taste like honey more, but it was still an excellent cake.  I don't expect the leftovers to hang around very long.  I will make this again for sure.

Mixed reactions -- some liked it, some said it was too sweet.  I don't think I will be making this again.  Thanks anyway!

All the flavors of baklava, with far less work.
