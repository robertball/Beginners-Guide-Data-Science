Decrease the amount of sugar a little, use a good quality orange marmalade which shouldn't be very sweet, and add a good splash or two of cabernet savignon!  These small changes made for a very easy but memorable sauce to use with left over baked ham.

This was a great base recipe to start from.  I must admit I hardly ever follow a recipe exactly.  The changes I made:  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I left out the salt and sugar entirely.  I used a shake of cinnamon along with the cloves.  It was sweet and spicy and thick.  Wonderful over ham or chicken.

Thin the corn starch with a little bit of cold water before you add it to the mixture, or else you'll end up with small clumps of corn starch in the finished recipe.  Our family thought this recipe was too sweet.

My mom made this tonight and I didn't care for it at all. It was wayy too sweet for me and didn't really have any good flavor. Won't make it again.

This is a great sauce. I didn't have marmalade, so I used apricot jam instead.  Delicious!  Then I put the hot sauce through a sieve so it was a smooth gravy-like sauce.  Thanks so much.

Very nice sauce to complement the salty ham. I had to use red pepper jelly since I didn't have orange marmalade, and I added a squirt of maple syrup. My family all enjoyed it, even the ones who don't like raisins (they just had the sauce without the raisins.)

I would omit the sugar entirely as it is very sweet.  I used pineapple juice instead of orange and cinnamon instead of cloves.  Absolutely mix the cornstarch with a little water before adding to raisin mixture.

I didn't have cloves so I left that part out of the recipe.  I knew better to add the dry mixture to the boiling sauce and it did make clumps so I put everything in the blender and it turned out GREAT.  I served it with a pork roast and my roommate couldn't stop eating it.  It made a good amount of sauce so now I have some in the fridge and look forward to using it with some pork chops.

I rarely give five stars, but this one deserves it.  Barb warmed it up for lunch the next day, and that is a rare occurance.  Delicious!

My family loves this sauce, but I left out the marmalade completely. It's great that a person really can tweak this a lot of ways and get it to the flavor you like. We like the tang without the super sweetness of preserves plus it still makes plenty for one big ham.

The sauce was way too orangey and sweet.  Tastes much better with the addition of vinegar  and more cloves.

I lost my old recipe for ham sauce and recently found this one.  I used it for my Easter ham and was thrilled with the way it came out.  I did cut back on the sugar as it sounded pretty sweet.  The  marmalade added a wonderful flavor and made it look very appealing.  My kids love it when I add maraschino cherries to it. It looks very festive for Christmas.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

It says I made it 3 times, but I only made it once.  I liked the basic recipe but I decided that sugar and marmalade would be too sweet, so I did not use marmalade, just the sugar.  I loved the pinch of cloves & actually added a bit more.  I grated the peel (not just zest) of one orange to get tangy pieces in place of the marmalade, & used a few less raisins--3/4 cup.  Everyone loved it & I will share my version with family, per their request.

I used a 3-fruit marmalade and this recipe worked great as one of several side dishes with South African Bobotie (see "Best Bobotie" on this site). Remember to add the cornstarch mixture slowly, whisking continuously, otherwise you'll get clumps.
