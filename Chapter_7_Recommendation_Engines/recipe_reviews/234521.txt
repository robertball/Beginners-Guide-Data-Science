I have made this twice now. I liked it the first time but it turned out better the second time.
Changes (doubled the recipe both times):
1st time- peanut butter for almond butter
Both times- 1 1/2 cups cocoa powder instead of all 2 cups chocolate chips
An additional 2-4 tsp coconut oil with the chocolate-cinnamon mixture (to moisten)
Used whipped cream to top it off and add extra sweetness but not too much extra carb.

Made this yesterday....so good and so moist! Even my non-paleo friends and family said they really liked it. I did add a little raw honey to the mixture. Will absolutely make this again...very soon!!

The bread looks delicious, however butter cannot be used when you're eating paleo.

I am not a paleo eater, but the recipe sounded yummy. I left some chocolate chips whole and it was scrumptious! I did not have coconut flour, so I just used reular flour, so mine wasn't totally paleo, but it was healthier. Thanks for posting this recipe!

The consistency is really good. I think it turned out really good. I'm new to Paleo and don't bake from scratch often. But I think it turned out pretty well! I used Ghee in place of butter and made the chocolate from unsweetened coco powder and a teaspoon of honey. If you want non Paleo people and kids to eat it up, you may want to add some honey to the dough to give it a little more sweetness.

I have to give 5 stars to any recipe my picky five year old will eat! She loves this, and so do my 2 year old sons. Moist and just sweet enough. I made it with almond butter the first time as the recipe calls for, and also turned out great with peanut butter in a pinch.

This is a nice addition to a gluten free/carb free dessert.  I really enjoy it with strawberries.  Adding a natural sweetener will improve the flavor.

5 stars for sure and so good!  I didn't find it dry as some other did.  The only thing is I could not get the chocolate to "swirl" in enough I guess, and there were large parts of just chocolate, which made cutting the bread pretty a little difficult.  Tasty though, and everyone loved it :)

Delicious but a little dry. Next time I will follow other suggestions of adding honey or something to keep it more moist.   Also, this made twice as much chocolate as I need to create a swirl... I ended up refrigerating the rest. Next time, rather than swirl, I might just throw in a handful of chocolate chips.

This was my first attempt at Paleo bread baking.  I am SO glad that I started with this recipe.  It was an absolute hit in my home with my husband and my children!  I'll be making it again!

Tasted good but was dry. Next time I will add a second banana and when using dark chocolate chips add sweetness through sugar or honey.

very good. I didn't melt the chocolate, but put the chips directly into the recipe.  Was very good, 5 and 2 yr old approved.

I made this recipe, only substitution  was almond flour for coconut flour, that was all I had on hand.  Taste and texture are very good.  The chocolate sank to the bottom of the bread in mine, even though I marbled as directions indicated.  Did not affect overall taste though.  I will try again with coconut flour and see if the marbling is better.  Certainly not carb free, but much lower carb than standard banana bread

I just made this and it turned out to be pretty tasty.  I do wish it was a bit more moist, so I think I'll add honey & more coconut oil next time.  After reading previous reviews, it sounds like that may be a good plan.

Delicious.  No real changes made.  The chocolate mixture was a bit more solid than liquid so next time I might add more coconut oil to the mixture before adding to the pan.
