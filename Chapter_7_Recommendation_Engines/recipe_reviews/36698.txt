This cake is incredible!  It's really easy, and terrific warm from the oven with some light vanilla ice cream.  I've made it several times, and it always satisfies the "chocolate beastie" within.  ;-)

Very easy to make, but I thought it was lacking something...  I think that next time I will add melted chocolate or chocolate chips to the mix or more sugar or something.  I loved the texture of the cake so much that I'm not going to give up just yet!

As good as everyone says!  I think the bit of ice cream is necessary because otherwise it would be overwhelmingly chocolately even for a chocoholic like me.

Quick and easy. I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. This cake is really only good when warm out of the oven. I thought it tasted horrible the next day. Really fake chocolate tasting.

I really wasn't impressed with this dish. I usually really like pudding cakes, but this one wasn't anything special. It tasted sort of burned, even though it definitely wasn't, the texture of the cake was off, and it stuck to your teeth. I don't think I'll be making this again.

This recipe was delicious!  Sad to say, I've never made a cake from scratch before (I always start with a box of cake mix) but this one sounded easy enough.  Not only was it great (my friends raved about it and requested the recipe) but it was super easy and different.  I used 3/4 cup of water instead of a cup because it seemed like a lot, and it came out perfect.  It's a really nice cake for mid-morning, not too sweet or rich - just right!  Thanks for sharing!
