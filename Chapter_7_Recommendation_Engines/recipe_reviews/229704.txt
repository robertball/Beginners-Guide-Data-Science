I would lessen the butter to half a stick (4T) for the bottom of the pan.  Also, for one reviewer who has doubts about NOT mixing the layers...there's a reason for this. As the cobbler batter cooks from the bottom up, it surrounds the juicy berries and looks a bit like sloppy dough was originally put on top of the dessert. So please follow directions about NOT mixing the layers. It makes a huge difference as to how well the cobbler batter puffs up to the surface, creating that crispy, slightly sticky yumminess on the top.
Not only am I making a fruit cobbler today, I'm also making homemade vanilla ice cream so as to have it chilled and ready to go when the cobbler comes out piping hot and all bubbly from the oven! YUMM!

Okay, I've FINALLY found it!  The recipe my grandmother used to make, but she called it "Lazy Man's Pie." I'm thrilled that I got my hands on it again, because I've been dying for some and couldn't remember the proper proportions for the batter.

Way too much butter. It was soggy and in clumps not swirled like the image.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times as is, and I've altered it for different fillings. My mom even uses this for her cobblers too! Thank you for sharing!

I added 1/2 -1 cup fresh blueberries. Agree that it only needs 4 T butter. Fresh blueberries cut the sweet a little bit. This is so easy and a favorite.

I used this recipe for small individual cobblers of different fruits for my sons church youth groups bake sale fund raiser, all I did was double the batter part of the recipe and left the fruit part the same came out with four small individual loaf pan cobblers, we just asked for donations and were getting ten and twenty dollar donations a piece, their that good!!, and easy to make, just keep an eye on them in the oven, being small you cut down the time a little.??

I've used this batter recipe for quite a while. I normally use fresh, frozen or home-canned fruit because I prefer a less sweet fruit filling. I would also recommend reducing the butter to 4 tbs.  Recently made it with Lucky Leaf stawberry-rhubarb pie filling and it was very good!
