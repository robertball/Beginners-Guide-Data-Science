This is a great recipe!  I substituted fat-free cream cheese and Splenda Sugar Blend for a low-fat, low-sugar alternative.  Also served with apples and graham crackers sticks instead of gingersnaps.  YUM!

Thanksgiving reunion with over 40 people...expensive.  Spiced pumpkin dip to tide them over...priceless!  A big hit!  I'll try it warm with gingerbread cookies for Christmas Eve.

The orange flavor was overpowering, and although it had potential, it was a bust.  I would try again with half the orange extract or none at all.

WOW! Hubby and the kids all loved this. I substituted frozen orange concentrate for the extract, because it was on hand, it worked very well. Tastes yummy on sliced apples, ginger snaps and graham crackers.

I've made this the last two years.  This year I left out the orange extract because and used vanilla extract instead.  I figured it would appeal to more people that way.  I've received several compliments and requests for the recipe.  I think that it would be great with graham crackers.

This was pretty good but I still prefer the pumpkin fluff dip on this site. This recipe was heavier and the other is what the title suggests; fluffy.

You know, this was just ok. It was easy to make and tasted good, but do you really need a dip for cookies? To go with the dip, I made "Grandma's Gingersnap Cookies" (from this site) and they were just awesome. I made this dip based on the reviews, and it was good, I just don't know if it was good with cookies. I took the dish to a baby shower and got the same reaction - it's ok, but most people would rather just eat the cookies. My sister dislikes anything that looks like baby food, so she wasn't too impressed. I myself just found it lacking.

This is very, very good.  My 12-year old neice made it under my supervision.  She had a ball and was thrilled that it tasted so good!  I highly recommend using exactly the amount of pumpkin puree called for an not more, or the dip is too thin.  She carved out a small pumpkin and served the dip in that.  Very nice treat!

I've made this delicious dip for holiday parties the last two years with great success.  If you enjoy pumpkin pie, don't hesitate to try this easy recipe.  Gingersnaps make the perfect accompaniment.

This is tasty and got lots of compliments at my stepson's Thanksgiving Feast...several of his teachers asked for the recipe. I skipped the orange extract altogether on the advice of other reviewers.

This was really good. It made a lot, so be prepared to have a good amount of dipping items. Ginger snaps and pears were excellent with this. Simple, and can easily be made ahead.

This is tasty but makes so much, some always goes to waste. It hasn't been popular at parties I've taken it to, I guess cookies don't need to be sweeter! I give it 4 stars because it is easy and tasty, but not 5 due to it's lack of popularity and quantity.

I thought the recipe was very good except the orange extract. Honestly, when I looked at the recipe, I questioned adding the orange, but did it anyway since I'm no cooking/baking expert. Then I realized I should have went with my instinct. Other than that LOVED the recipe. WILL DO again, but next time without any orange extract at all.  *If you like a stronger orange flavor, this recipe is for you! :)  VERY quick and easy to make in just a few minutes!!

This was very good. We served it was pretzels and apples. I didn't include the orange extract and used cinnamon and nutmeg  because I don't have pumpkin pie spice. This had a similar flavor to pumpkin pie.

I was not blown away with this recipe.  I loved the idea of it and it sounded like a nice change of pace, but I wouldn't make it again.  It wasn't finger licking good, but it was not bad.

I added extra pumpkin because it needed the flavor, but then it was a little bit too runny. Next time I might just add more spices instead of pumpkin and try it that way.

Unfortunately, I brought this to an event with a poorly lit buffet table so many people thought it was peanut butter and didn't try it.  But the ones who did try it, raved about it.  I thought it was very yummy too!  Especially with apples and pears (but the gingersnaps were good too).

This is a fantastic recipe!  I set the cream cheese by a vent from my hot stove while I baked my own gingersnaps, which made it nice and creamy-soft.  I beat the cheese with the sugar in my stand mixture -- no lumps, perfect texture!  Accidentally added doubled ginger (it was alredy in my pumpkin pie spice, btw... that's Pumpkin Pie Spice II from this site, sorry McCormick but I didn't have it on hand).  LOVE the orange extract!!  I'm no critic but I can say it added just a little something unexpected and extra that pushed this recipe over the edge to a 5-star. Might be fun to try different flavors like vanilla, almond or maple.  Doubled the recipe and it yeilded almost 9 cups of dip.  Will serve in a little carved out pumpkin.  Can't wait to try it once it has chilled and the flavors have blended.  Yum!

This was a great recipe!  I followed the advice and served it with apples, gingersnaps, and graham crackers.  The apples were the biggest hit, although it tasted great with all of it!  I had 3 people beg for the recipe.

I don't know what else to say except that his is a hit EVERY time I make it.

Everyone is so complimentary and it is THE easiest thing to prepare and serve away or at home.  Perfect for office parties and when you are hosting guests.

Go on TRY IT!!!!

I made this and brought it to work. It was a hit with the ginger snaps. Instead of using pumpkin pie spice, I used equal parts of ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. Warning: it makes far more than the number of servings listed would lead you to believe.

My favorite Dip is "spiced Pumpkin Dip". It taste very good. We love it.
