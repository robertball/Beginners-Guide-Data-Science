My husband really loved this and kept raving over it.  I thought it would need more seasonings but it was just fine for him.  The fried apples were delicious with this.  Thanks for the recipe. It made a great meal.

Made it for my family and some friends - lots of kids and we ALL loved it!  I made no changes and won't next time either.  Keep it simple!  Definitely a company-worthy recipe. Served it with asparagus and roasted red potatoes. Delicious!

Easy to make, great taste, grilled very quickly, and the family, who usually won't eat pork unless it's bacon, loved it.  Thanks for the simple recipe, all the ingredients were in most mostly bare cupboard.

Outdoor grill. It set up, so cooked the trnderloin medalions on a grill pan. What caught the family's attention was the apples. Five-year-old asking me to make it again.  So simple.
