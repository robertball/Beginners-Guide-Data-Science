This recipe was absolutely delicious. I have never cooked with fennel before and had no idea what it tasted like. As I prepared the fennel, I took a nibble and found it to be yummy. After preparing the dish I was curious as to how my picky husband would like it. As he was devouring his second serving, he declared it was “delicious “. I will be preparing this dish many times. The leftovers was equally delicious.

Great weeknight quick recipe --though it was good enough to serve for company!  I had never used fresh fennel, and I must say it added nice flavor and dimension to the dish.  It is very good the next day, as well!

This dish will move right up there with your other top pasta recipes!  I enjoyed the easy prep and quick cook time of this delicious Bolognese dish.  Although the fennel is in season it did take a trip to two stores to find it, and was worth every minute of the effort.  This is the first time I used fresh fennel which looks a little like celery but with wispy ends on the stalk instead of leaves (simply chop it like you would celery).  The fennel added a nice delicate flavor to the beef and mushrooms that really made the meal memorable.  Thanks for the great Recipe Hunt's, we will definitely be making this again!

Made this with some alterations.  Used spiralized zucchini instead of noodles and used about half the diced tomatoes listed (thanks to another review).  It was a hit!  Will definitely make again. But may use Italian sausage instead of beef, just to try something different.

If I made this dish and if I did it over again I would use only 1 can of diced tomatoes as it was overly tomato-tized. Also could not find the Hunt's Recipe Squeezable Paste at my local grocery store so just used a can of tomatoe paste. It worked out all right. But a night or two later after I put the leftovers in a corning wear dish and reheated it in the mike it tasted so much better as leftovers usually do. I guess it just needed to soak thru more. So right off the stove allright, leftovers even better.
