My husband and I loved this soup. I did however make some minor changes. First, I added one beef soup bone, I find that this always helps add more flavor to any soup. Second I used 2 cups of water, 2 cups of beef broth, and 2 cups of chicken broth to balance the flavors. Also, I added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Last, I only used 1/2 a cup of barley and I added the barley 2hrs. before serving it. The first time I made this soup I added the barley in the beginning the barley ended up mushy.

I made this for dinner last night and it was great, except for one thing.  When I browned the stew meat in the oil the recipe said "add a little water to the skillet and stir to pick up the browned bits."  I did that but my soup turned out WAY too greasy, next time I would just use the meat!

We really enjoyed this soup on a cold rainy day in winter...but....slow cooked beef combined with the barley did something ....um..cleansing to our systems!  So I caution anyone with digestive problems to be aware of this.  It was very delicious, that's for sure, but it's become a bit of a comedy thing around here when I threaten to make the crock pot beef barley soup!
:-)  Perhaps next time I'll make it without the beef, and add cold roast beef at the end of the cooking...that should be ok.

Great basics.  Used all beef broth, added carrots, used 3 large yellow onions, real garlic, more spices.  It was still bland at the end, but I found the secret....added some fennel seed for the last half hour....perfect!!

A nice budget friendly, easy soup for a cool winter day. I only had quick cooking barley, so I added it in the last 30 minutes of cooking.

Took into account the comments about being a little bland.  Browned stew meat w/ diced yellow onion and thyme.  Added to the crockpot 1 1/2 cans beef broth, 6 cups water and 4tbsp. of beef granules.  Then added sliced carrots, can of corn and can of diced tomoatoes.  Two hrs. before serving I added the barley.  So yummy!!  My husband loved it and my very fussy, no veggie eating teenager LOVED it also.  Will definitely make again.

I used chopped white onion, instead of the green onion.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Great way to used leftover pot roast, steak, etc.!

I found this soup to be to plain tasting for my family, It was easy enough and turned out fine, looked good, but there was just no flavor to it. I would recomend adding alittle something more to it, I don't think I'll try this one again.

This is such an easy recipe!  I've made it with the beef and without and it's just as good.  I did adjust the seasonings a bit to my taste but that's the only change I made.  I'm looking forward to making it more often this winter!

In regards to the barley, use pearl barley instead of the quick cooking variety in the crock pot.

My mom made the best beef barley soup but never had a recipe. She just tossed stuff in, so I tried to find something similar. This is what I did and it was much like my mom's.
I browned some beef on a large marrow bone( not sure which cut- my husband picked it up) in olive oil. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and fresh cut garlic and sautee'd for a bit. I added three stalks of cut up celery and some fresh mushrooms as well. I put the meat/bone mixture in a crockpot, added carrots and a handful of fresh parsley. I substituted the green onion and added one  onion cut up in large chunks. Then poured in two cans of beef broth and filled the crock pot the rest of the way up ( minus 2 inches) with water. I cooked on low for 8 hours. I then added 1/2 cup of barley and a can of drained butter beans. I cooked on low for an addtional hour and it tasted just like my mom's soup. I love the flavor , as it reminds me of what I had growing up. At first the broth is thin and I love it that way but if it just sets a bit after you turn off the heat, it thickens up and I love it that way as well. I rate my own a 4.

@ Moochiecat:  Any time everyone who eats the same thing ends up all having 'digestive problems', usually means that the meat used was improperly handled and/or expired and should not have been used.

I think this is a great recipe! Warm and hearty...good for cold winter days. I tweaked the seasonings to my taste, but Im not one for writing a review based on a million alterations. This recipe was good as is, and better when changed for my tastes. Even my husband, the pickiest of picky gobbled this right up. A winter staple in our house.

This is a great starter recipe for Beef Barley Soup.  I don't bother with the slow cooker; I do it right on my stovetop.  I let it simmer on low for about 2 or 3 hours, and the beef comes out unbelievably tender. I also don't use the plain water at all.  I use all beef broth to cook the veggies and the meat and it works so much better than just water.  I also add balsamic vinegar and a touch of tomato paste to the meat to give some tanginess.

Outstanding!  I was trying to use ingredients from my pantry, so I used almost three boxes of organic chicken broth.  I pressed three small cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder.  I used a large yellow onion instead of the green onions.  Added a tad more meat, a pinch more salt and I inadvertantly added the thyme at the beginning instead of just before serving.  I also followed another reviewer's tip and added the barley 2-3 hours before serving.  All said, this is the best soup I've ever made.  I took a large bowl of it to my neighbors along with a pan of cornbread.  They enjoyed it, too!

I halved the recipe for use in my small slow cooker. This turned out as more of a stew than a soup, but I'm OK with that. I couldn't find beef broth without MSG, so I used beef stock instead. I tossed the beef with salt, pepper, and flour before browning, and used a bit of the beef stock to deglaze the skillet instead of water. I also used a regular onion rather than green onions. The beef was very tender and the barley and the carrots didn't get mushy (I don't like mushy carrots) despite the long cooking time. I'll make this again for sure.

I made this recipe yesterday and it came out great.  As it was getting closer to being done I thought that it could use something extra.  After reading through some reviews I decided to add some Worcestershire Sauce and Beef Boullion. Thats exactly what it needed.   Next time I will add the barley about 2-3 hours before its finished.   Great recipe!!!!

It was pretty good. I followed instructions in the comments to add all the ingredients to the slow cooker, except the barley, cook for 10 hours, then let the barley in an hour before finish. I thought "wow, I have way more than a half cup of barley, what if I make it 1 cup?" That was a mistake ... now I have a soup that's about the consistency of oatmeal! I'll try to thin it out with more broth.

I added barley in 2 hours before it was ready to avoid mush; and I added 1 can of chicken broth in place of some of the water; also added 1 can of rotel diced tomatoes with chiles, which gave it some spice; used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables; turned out great! will definitely make again.

When I first made this soup, I made it exactly according to the recipe. I had bought all my ingredients fresh that day so the only thing I could think that caused it to go wrong was the canned beef broth. 

So I made it again, this time with a quart of beef stock (the kind Swanson makes). I'm sure it's not as good as homemade stock would be, but it was a vast improvement from the canned broth. That is the only change I would suggest to this recipe. Otherwise it is great.

I have electric pressure cooker that I used to make this soup.  Beef Barley Soup has always been a bland soup which is good when you are not feeling well but for normal times I dress it up. I use fresh or frozen carrots (I buy precut matchstick carrot to use in soup a lot). I use the green onions but I use 12 instead of 6. Always fresh garlic over powder and I add 2 tsp of Mrs. Dash. I cook the Meat for 20 Minutes after I brown with no oil with everything but the barley.  I let cool down then add the barley and cook on rice setting. Came out great. I also add a hand full of fresh snapped green beans when I put the barley in as well.

Absolutely the best. Very simple, nourishing, affordable meal. My husband very sincerely gets tears of happiness in his eyes just thinking about it, and he didn't even know he liked barley until I made this for him. I had no parsley, and forgot the thyme, and it is still excellent.

I found this recipe to be delicious. The only thing I would change is cut the onions in half and add more carrots. My wife, daughter and I thought there was just many onions. It sort of over took the flavor.

Really enjoyed this soup.  I added a can of diced tomatoes.  Beware, 1 tsp of pepper leaves it quite spicy.  A bit much for my husband.  Next time I will half that.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.

I qppreciate that this recipe utilizes the slow cooker, which I like to use when we are busy. In this case, we were gone all day, and it was nice to come home to an already cooked meal.  I added in some corn and kept the recipe the same otherwise.  My husband and I liked this, but the kids said  that they didn't really care for the barley.

I really liked this recipe.  The longer it sits the better it gets.  I guess I didn't realize that my crockpot would not hold all the ingredients.  I put everything in the crockpot, with the addition of a can of petite diced tomatoes, and absolutely did not have room for the 6 cups of water.  I added as much as I could.  I probably added between 1 and 2 cups of water.  Needless to say my soup was a little thick, but fortunately we like it that way, and we both thought it was delish!!  I also forgot to add the thyme at the end, not sure what that would have added.  Will definately make again and again.

Absolutely loved this soup! I had tons of stew meat and didn't know what to do with it, and came across this recipe.  It made so much I was able to take half of it to my grandparents! I didnt have fresh parsley or onions, and can't wait to make it again with those added.

WARNING!  The recipe calls for adding the barley at the beginning.  Do not add until about 30 minutes before the soup should be done.  I followed the recipe and the barley was mushy and pretty gross by the time 6 hours in the slow cooker had passed.  As far as flavor goes, I thought it was OK but my family refused to eat it and ended up eating sandwiches instead!

I've made this a couple times now.  1st time with condensed soup and 2nd with broth (Swanson's)...I should have done as told.  The condensed gives it much more flavor!  I just toss frozen stew meat, broth, garlic and onion in slow cooker on high for a few hours.  Then I add celery, carrots (extra!), thyme, pepper and barley.  Let it go on low for a few more hours and we all devour it!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this yesterday and my family really enjoyed it!  The meat was so tender!  I did follow the advice to add the barley with about 2 hours left, and I turned the cooker to high for it.  Definitely will be using this again

Delicious... I also added yellow onion. Only thing I would change would be to cook the barley separately... Turned out a bit starchy. Otherwise a great recipe. A dollop of sour cream on top and some Portuguese rolls, and dinner is served!!

Very hearty and tasty stew! I loved how tender the beef was from using the slow cooker. Easy to make and freeze for more dinners another day. I used fresh thyme rather than dried, and it needed a bit of salt. I will make this again for sure!

This soup is ok. A little bland. I left out the scallions and used 1 chopped yellow onion instead. The meat was very tender and this makes a LARGE batch of soup. I just felt like it was missing something. Next time I make this, and I will make it again because it has potential, I will use fresh herbs (thyme and parsley) and some mushrooms. I also may use chicken broth instead of beef.

Wow this was great.  I wanted something a little bit thicker so I used the Beef Barley STEW recipe PLUS the Slow Cooker Beef Barley Soup recipe together.  It turned into a really thick soup.  I used 8 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of water. One of the boxes of beef broth was a fancy one made from sirloin steak and was labeled BOLD. I added 1 TBSP of balsamic vinegar and a 1/2 Cup  of White Wine. Cooked it for 8 hours on low.  DELISH !

This is a great beef barley soup recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I did have to, though.  I didn't have enough beef stock so I used beef boullion.  That was fine.  I also wanted to try my fresh herbs instead of the dried thyme.  Other than those very minor changes, this was fantastic and very easy to make.  My fiance had never had beef barley and was kind of skeptical of it and he now is a big fan of the stuff and wants more of it!

This was pretty good, and very easy to put together. But it seemed to be missing something.  Am going to play with seasongs a bit.  But even so I would make it again as it is a great healthy and filling meal on a chilly winter day!

I've used this recipe several times and my husband and I both like it.

We thought it was too watery, so we use (6) 14.5 oz cans of beef broth and don't add any water.

He's a big beef fan, so I also increase the beef to 2 or 2 1/2 lbs.

Add bread and salad and you have a great meal on for a cold afternoon!

I tried both beef and chicken versions with double the pepper and thyme to give it a bit more kick.  My daughter likes to add Tiger Sauce to get an even spicier soup.  A definite keeper!

This was a wonderful recipe, after reading many reviews I added the barley the last 2hours of cooking for a firmer barley it worked great, I did mistakenly add the thyme at the start of the recipe. It worked out fine. Prep time was minimal flavor was powerful, if anyone finds this to bland I would suggest adding afew dashes of Worcestershire. I will call this recipe a keeper especially since it even pleased my fussy eater

I love this soup! It was the first time I made anything with Barley and it turned out so yummy!  I'm hooked now.  The only changes I made was to use ground beef, because I had it on hand, and bouillon cubes reconstituted to make the broth.  I think I did the bouillon cubes wrong though because it turned out saltier then the sea.  I don't count that as a problem of the recipe though, that was my fault.  So good! Thank you for sharing!

This was good....but liked it much better once it sat overnight in my 'fridge and then warmed it up the next day.  I always think soup tastes better when it sits and absorbs all the flavors.  I added a little less barley and and a little extra beef broth.  Will make this again....the day before I serve it.

Thank you for this great recipe. I think it was just a little bit too peppery... I will reduce the pepper amount to 1/2 next time. I used fresh garlic and added fresh mushrooms. We really enjoyed it!

I gave this a 3-star rating, because to be honest I did not try the soup as it ended up. I was trying to re-create a thick barley soup we had at a restaurant. I started with this recipe in the crock pot, then when it was done I transferred it to a pot and added a blonde roux (recipe on this site as well). Yum yum yum!! Perfect :-)

Bummer.  I have read LOTS of reviews from LOTS of recipes on this site that have complained about blandness and have never had a problem - even when I've had to add just a bit more salt and pepper than called for - but this time, the reviewers were right.  I added extra salt, extra pepper, garlic salt, Worcestershire sauce, a bit of A1, tomato paste, blackstrap molasses, sage, and finally Adobo (a salt and pepper combo that's popular in Cuban kitchens) and still, to quote another reviewer: there was no "wow" in my mouth.  In fact all of those things barely made a dent!  I did follow one reviewer's advice and looked up the Beef Barley Stew recipe on here and added about 2 T balsamic vinegar and it kind of helped, but not really, and it was honestly a last ditch effort.  It's very pretty, but pretty just isn't gonna cut it this time.  I appreciate the recipe, but next time I'll be looking for something different.

This was excellent!! My family loved it. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder & extra blk pepper when i cooked the meat. I doubled the recipe so we would have left-overs. It turned out so good, I will make it all the time.

I added 4 cups of beef broth, 3 cups of water, 2 tsps of ground thyme, and reduced the salt by 1/4 (hubby has high bp).  I added a can of Northern beans, and cooked the soup for 10 hours on low.  The soup came out out so thick and rich.  Yummy!

There is only one thing I would add.....steak sauce! Just a few dashes (depending on how large your slow cooker is) and it spices up any blandness that is in there! Use the spicy A1 steak sauce for any needed kick. 
I tend to eyeball it. I have a small slowcooker, since there is only me and my fiance....but we both love it!

The first thing about this recipe that grabbed my attention was that it is made in a slow cooker. The prep for this is easy and smelled delicious almost instantly, but the taste is SO bland. I have done everything I could to spice it up including fresh garlic, onion powder, extra garlic powder, garlic salt, and finally tomato sauce, but it's still just so-so. I've thrown it out and will NOT make this again!

Our favorite beef barley soup! I add a can of tomato sauce or stewed tomatoes for a bit more flavor, and use more beef broth/less water. Thick and yummy!

Excellent soup. I've looked a long time for good beef barley soup.Easy prep then put in slow cooker and forget it. I did find that 6 stalks of celery was too much as was 6 onions. I used 4 stalks of celery and 3 onions. I cooked it 8 hours and found that maybe too much as I would have liked the barley a little more al dente. You will love this soup.

I cooked this too long - 11 hours - because I work, but it smelled great when i walked in the door.  It was a little thicker but still good.  Good reviews from the people I served, and four of us went through the whole thing in one meal. I would make it again, but it won't be an often repeat.

This is a great soup!  I make a double batch either on the stove top or in the slow cooker, then I 
can the remainder for future use.  My husband and kids love it, too.  It is still just as good canned 
as fresh.  My family prefers my canned version to anything store bought.

This is a decent base recipe. I have a smaller slow cooker than what this recipe was intended for so I couldn't use the recommended amount of liquid. I used around 3 stalks of celery because 4 seemed overkill. I would use all beef broth or a combo of beef & chicken broth next time as the water leaves it too flavorless. Aside from that, I added in 2 cans of diced potatoes, 2 cans of green beans, and 2 cans of peas. I used 2 lbs of cube steak and it was the perfect amount of meat. I was trying to replicate that Campbell's beef vegetable soup. This was very close. The only issue I had was that it seems to lack a true savory flavor, other wise it was good. Also, I used Pearl Barley and let it cook for 6-7 hours and it turned out fine, not mushy at all. It seems like the fast cooking barley many other use requires you to add it in last minute.

O.K. without modification but lacks any kind of flavor.  We are going to try again using all beef broth, and delay adding in the barley so it's not overcooked.

I made this soup recently on a nice cold day.  I followed the recipe exactly but it needed more salt and pepper for my taste.  I used one cup of barley and it was just the right amount. The only thing is the second day.  Soup really got very thick and I had to add more beef broth. Otherwise, the family enjoyed it.

I really loved this soup
the only thing I did different is I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the soup it's self while cooking and I switch out the green onions for 1  leek  I also only cooked it for 5 hours on high.
it was so yummy I'll be making this over and over yum.

This was great!  I wasn't sure about the green onions (I usually use yellow onions) but it turned out really good.  Not sure if it's really necessary to brown the beef.  I used 3/4 cup of barley and didn't use as much celery and carrots as the recipe called for.

Have made this several times now. Make a few simple changes for an awesome soup. Use all beef broth for the liquid - no water, add the pearl barley the last 2 hours of cooking time. The soup is very thick the next day. My husband and I and other family found this very tasty and just the kind of soup to warm you up on a cold winter's day

This is a great simple recipe.  I used all unsalted beef broth and yellow onion, fresh garlic.  For those that felt it bland, let it cool and reheat and the flavors are perfect.  I usually make it early in the morning, let it cool and reheat at dinner and the flavors really blend together.

I thought this soup was just okay.  The meat itself came out tender and flavorful with the salt, pepper and garlic, but the soup itself was kind of boring.  I did however find the soup somewhat tastier as leftovers the next day.

A terrific recipe.  I used leftover roast and a ton more veggies and the results were outstanding.  Next time, I'll consider adding a bit of hot pepper to add a little heat to the mix.

Very disappointing. Really bland even though it smelled great while cooking. I even added a bay leaf and some italian seasoning out of desperation. I used stew meat, maybe I needed something fattier.....definitely not worth the time and effort if you like savory flavors in your food.

I cooked this on the stovetop & I used leftover, cubed t-bone steaks (cooked to MED) so I just gave my veggies a quick saute & then added the beef, broths & spices. I only had about 3/4 cup of beef broth & another cup of chicken so I combined those & added enough vegetable broth ( a very rich homemade broth) to make up the difference & then used another 2 cups or so instead of water. I added minced garlic, a couple of bay leaves, worcestershire & about a tbp of beef base. I also cut the barley back to a little more than half. Wonderful soup that was full of flavor....thanks Robin!

This was pretty good with some modifications.  I reduced the water by 3 cups, because I wanted a more stew like consistancy.  Used fresh garlic instead of powder, as that is what I had on hand.  Omitted the cererly, (didn't have any)  Also added a can of corn and fennel seeds per other reviewers suggestions.  Not sure if I will make this again.

I followed this recipe to a T and it's very good!  The only suggestions I have are that I would use at least 2lbs. of beef. And don't buy "stew meat" - use a sirloin or roast and cube it.  The meat is so tender and just melts in your mouth. I also added a few more carrots. I wouldn't call it bland, but it could use a few more spices, maybe just a bit more garlic & pepper.  Everybody loves it, it's good for you and it's perfect for the fall & winter. YUUUUMMY!

Excellent taste, as I did not have enough time to do slow cooker I used the ingredients and prepared the dish in my pressure cooker. The combinations of the ingredients is the true key to the flavor of this dish, fast or slow!

Pretty darn good.  I have a 3qt slow cooker though, so I didnt have quite enough room for all the water.  I added it in later (after cookiung when I packed it up to freeze) and everything still tastes yummy. Becky and the kids liked it too.

I must have a smaller sized crock pot because I was only able to fit about 5 cups of water.  It tasted fabulous.  The barley is a nice change from using potatoes all the time.  By the way, I ended up adding the 6th cup of water after the soup was done in order to make it more liquidy and to cut down on the salty taste.

I followed the reciped exactly as stated.  It was too bland for my taste.  I neglected to read the reviews beforehand.  I wish that I had.  I would have found another recipe.  I won't make this one again.

Very nice recipe.  I tried adding a little more Barley (about 1/2 cup more - but I don't think I'll do that next time.  It was a little thick.  I also followed a prior reviewer suggestion, I used 7 cups of beef broth (made with beef bullion) and no water.
I'll do this one again.

Tasty soup!  Except mine turned out more like stew.  My slow cooker wasn't large enough so I could only put in half the recommended amount of water.  But I rather liked it as a thicker stew consistency.  Very tasty supper for a cold winter evening.  Think I would cut back on the thyme next time though.

One word - BLAH!  I even tried to spice it up with extra spices but it didn't help.  Was way too watered down.  Won't make again.

This soup is really very good - somewhat different from what I had been expecting but adding the spice at the end of the cooking really finishes this dish off nicely.  Very satisfying meal with bread on the side.

After finding this recipe I went out and bought a slow cooker just so I could make this soup. I found it to be an excellent soup and all my friends are asking when I am making it again. I love this soup.

Great recipe.  Great food.  I put the barley in early, which I will not do in the future.  Will save that for the last couple of hours.  Other than that, tastes great.  Will be doing again.

I made this exactly as recipe indicated but half way though day I could tell it was bland. Added 1 TBS  of minced garlic , half chopped onion , Worcestershire source, and a beef bouillon cube. It was really good and will make again without the dried Thyme , did not care for that spice. Made with corn bread .

Delicious!  I used chopped onion instead of green onion.  I also used a large pot and cooked it on the stove top for about three hours instead of a slow cooker.

I made this  by  mixing one pound of lean beef with leftover prime rib from Christmas Eve dinner and included the bones from the prime rib in the slow cooker.  It turned out fantastically and my entire family loved it!  We will definitely make it again.

I made this with a couple minor changes, added 1/2cup red wine at beginning. Then  I found when i tasted soup when almost done, it did not have enough depth to the flavor.  Added 2 teaspoons of powdered beef bullion and then it was one if the best soups I ever tasted. Oh and used 4 fresh and pressed garlic cloves not powder.

Made this tonight... didn’t have any barley so substituted pearled couscous, and used my electric pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker. Also added potatoes because we like them. Otherwise stuck to the recipe ! A bit bland, so spiced with additional salt, pepper and garlic at the end. All in all a nice beef stew.

This soup has a good flavor. We liked it.  I was unsuccessful in my attempt to cut the  recipe on half. My version had weak broth and not enough barley.  I plan to make this again. I'll try 5 cups of liquid, and a half cup of barley.  Spices I plan to add in addition to the ones in the recipe: 1 bay leaf, 1 clove of fresh garlic.

Makes a good substantial soup, but was rather bland tasting. I added half a jar of Better Than Bouillon flavoring and it perked it right up. I also added a bag of frozen beans carrots peas and corn to give it more color and veggies.

I had leftover roast that I had cut into chunks and froze along with the drippings..so I used this in place of the meat and some broth. Also added 4 cups of beef broth.(didn't add water).  I used carrots celery a couple mushrooms and garlic. Added a bay leaf, dried thyme and lots of pepper .  I love the idea of the barley cooking in the slow cooker.. so convenient.

I cooked it for about 3 hours on high and then 1 hour on low.  I thought it has a very good flavour.

I agree with other reviewers who thought the taste was bland.  Even with suggested additions it still lacked a depth of flavor that I was looking for.

I will definitely make again - was excellent.  I did make some changes that I thought I would mention for the novice cooks like me.  Not bland at all based on how I made it. 1) forgot the thyme - woops!  2) Think I used about half the parsley (was dried, not fresh)  Still came out great.  3) substitutions: all beef broth instead of broth/water combo.  Used about 1/2 of a white onion instead of green onions.  4) did not brown meat first (straight to crockpot) but I had marinated it overnight, seasoned with wine/garlic powder I had on-hand, added worcestershire & a small amount of red wine. (sorry, don't know exact measurements of those) Came out very tender even though I used cubed stew meat  5) I had taken advice of others re barley. crockpot was on low for 7.5 hours while at work with all main ingredients above.  Added barley when home, change to high, then cooked another 1 hr.  Barley turned out slightly firm - but that's how I like it.  All in all - fantastic!  It was hard for me to wait the hour while the barley settled in to eat it.

This is a treasure of a receipe.  I have to use chicken stock (low sodium) but that is the only thing I substitute or change.  We could eat this for dinner everyday. So filling and satisfying.

Thank you so very much for sharing it.

This is a great soup.  The only change I made was to add some fresh mushrooms.  One thing to note about the barley; if you use pearled barley, you can add it as it's stated in the recipe and it doesn't get mushy like other reviewers have stated.  I think this soup tastes better the second day, so the next time I make it, I will save it for the next day.

This is a pretty tasty recipe, as written.  This is an excellent recipe if a person adds a little more salt and a can of diced tomatoes.  I had to omit the garlic, though, because of an allergy, so salt may not be necessary without that omission.  Do not be tempted to thicken this one because the barley will swell and there won't be much liquid left for thickening.

Yes, I'd make this again.  After reading reviews, I baked the soup bones prior and then cut meat off and everything went in the pot. Fresh garlic vs. garlic powder, and yellow onion vs. green onion.    I needed to salt and pepper the meat prior to baking though, as the only thing I thought the soup was missing was salt.

Made this for my husband and I and we enjoyed it. We didn't find it bland at all as others have posted. I followed the recipe very closely. I used a chuck roast that I cut up myself. Before sauteing, I generously seasoned the meat with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and dried parsley. To the slow cooker, I added one clove of chopped garlic, along with a bit of salt and pepper. I used the called-for beef broth, but I added only 2 cups of water. I added the pearl barley with two hours left to the cooking time (six hours on low). The end result was a hearty, soup/stew with plenty of flavor.

Loved it with changes/additions. Looked at all the comments and did the following: Did not add water into pain with leftover beef (didn't want greasy), Used 4 cans of beef broth and 5 cups of water. Added bayleaf, used dried parsley, added some herbs de provence and added barley 2 hours before it was done. Used minced garlic instead of powder and used white onion instead of green onion.

I just love making beef barley soup in the fall.  For an additional flavoring, I use 1 large link of smoked sausage and add potatoes to make it hardier!  can't go wrong with those additions.  YUM

A delicious soup!  I didn't change a single ingredient or add anything else.  I only had quick-cooking barley, which works great if you add it about half way through cooking time.   It may be my not-so-slow cooker, or the fact that I halved the recipe, but this was cooked perfectly and ready to go in about five hours.  It has a rich, slightly buttery taste;  I would make again!

Kind of bland, so spices need to be changed. I wouldn't use scallions and I would add the barley at the end of cooking so it doesn't get mushy. I would also use all beef stock instead of broth and water. It's a good base recipe to use though!

I made this today adding fresh sweet onion and two garlic cloves.  This came out very tasty.  I also added mushrooms at the last hour.  8 hours on low.  Browned both cubed beef and beef short ribs. The short ribs were a bit greasy so I think next time I will not add as many.  I only added beef broth and left the water out so it was more stew like.  I did not  add the thyme - I forgot.  I will be making this again.

Didn't change anything except the beef broth - I used Consommé instead and the flavour was great!

This is the first time I've event made barley soup but I did change the recipe.  I used 2-  32oz. boxes of beef broth and reduced the water to 2 cups. Instead of the celery, onion and carrots, I added 2 small bags of frozen mixed vegetables and 3 leeks.  For the cooking temperature / time,  I cooked it on high for the first 3 hours and then reduced it to low until the barley and leeks were tender. It is fabulous!!

I used chicken and beef stock instead of water and added Worcestershire and Mushrooms. Cooked on high for 4 hours and the barley did not get mushy.  Delicious.

Wonderful recipe. Great flavor too! I was checking the meat and veggies and thought something was missing prior to adding the thyme, but it filled it out wonderfully. Made a double serving and it went quickly!

I put in the amount of water as directed but it was way too watery!!  I would probably use half as much water, maybe even less.  I ended up adding some more seasoning and left the slow cooker on a bit longer-turned out fine

Just made this tonight for supper, and it was very bland.  I followed the recipe, no changes.  I read the other reviews before I made this, but I always try to follow the recipe the first time.  If I make this again, I would add the barley closer to the end (like other reviewers have suggested), add white or yellow onion, and other spices as well (more garlic, fennel, etc).

This recipe is a good base. Like others, I tweaked it by using fresh garlic, yellow onion, bay leaf and some burgundy cooking wine.

We were all really looking forward to this recipe, however you wouldn't THINK it would taste bland from reading the ingredients, but we ended up adding 8237434 spices and sauces at the end to liven it up. Just beware you'll probably need to do this after you cook it.

Average soup.  I guess I was hoping for something with a bit more of a spice flavour.  Good winter soup, would use again as a base to zip up.

Good Recipe! Made at last minute on stove and family really liked it.  Changes I made were used vegetable broth and mushroom broth in place of 6 cups of water.  Added a dash of worchester sauce, A&1, and kitchen boquet.  Will make again.

Excellent recipe! I used more garlic powder and just a bit more salt because I am really into seasoning.  Otherwise I followed this recipe as is and it was a hit at my house.  The only disappointment was that there weren't any leftovers!

This is a great recipe.  I add a couple of bay leaves and 1 each chicken and beef bouillion  cubes to balances the flavor of the canned beef broth.  I also leave out the green onions, but thats just because I don't like onions of any sort.

How lovely to come home from work to a house redolent of this soup cooking all day and even better eating it with a piece of hearty whole grain sour dough bread!  It's a winner for ease of preparation and flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has potential, but I thought it had a little too much liquid and not enough veggies, etc.  Also, I would have reduced the barley by half.  It kind of overtook everything else in the pot.

mmm, good!  A great soup to make on a cool rainy day.  I used 3 10.5oz cans of vegetable broth and added 1 package of Knorr brand Vegetable soup mix but kept everything else the same.  I am glad that I used the bigger cans of broth because it was just the perfect consistency; not too thick and not too thin.  I did not use pearl barley but homegrown barley from my husband's family.  The combo of flavors was just perfect and was not a bit greasy.  I used just a tad canola oil when browning the beef.  Perfect flavor and seasoning and sooo incredibly easy.

I enjoyed this very much.  Two things I would change, however: (1) drain the oil from cooking the beef and (2) cook it longer than 7 hours, as carrots weren't very soft.

Tasted pretty good, but it didn't impress me.  Will probably go back to making beef barley soup over the stove rather than in the slow cooker.

Absolutely yummy!  Everyone in our family from 18months to 20 to 48 loved this.  I didn't even have any veggies in it (happened to run out before I made it) and it was great.  Will definitely make again, hopefully with some veggies next time!

I seasoned the meat in the crock pot with garlic and onion powder. Made with Italian herb bread from this site. Turned out fine.
I did use more seasoning. All the kids ate it, and some had seconds. I would make again.

Just ok.  Not very tasty. Came out more like a stew.

I wasn't wild about this. The barley soaked up all the broth and the thyme overpowered the flavor. I'm sure there's a better beef soup recipe out there so I'll keep looking. Thanks anyway!

This is great soup!  I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and used beef boullion broth in place of the water.  Very flavorful and rich.  I can't stop eating it and will make it again.

Too watery and very little flavor.  Definitely would not waste my time making this one again.

This soup is delicious.  I added twice the barley and I use chicken stock instead of beef.  A couple of bay leaves and some fresh garlic cloves really kick up the spice.  Put in half the suggested thyme.
