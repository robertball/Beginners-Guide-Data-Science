Loved it!!  I made this seasoning exactly as the recipe directed but poured the oil and seasoning over my chicken and into a ziplock and let it do it's thing all day while I was at work.  I love that I can whip this up with seasonings that I have in the cupboard too. **UPDATE**  Just 3 days later I tried it out on pork tenderloins.  2 one pound tenderloins in a ziplock, seasoning mix as recipe calls for and probably closer to 1/2 cup veggie oil. Marinated 4 hours. Baked at 425 for 25 minutes.  It made a gorgeous spicy, salty, and a little bit sweet crust on the tenderloins. Loved it even more than with the chicken.  I will decrease the salt to 2 tsp and increase the cayenne to 1/2 tsp next time as I think it might be a bit on the salty side and I'd like a little more heat .  Next time I'm going to try it on boneless chicken breasts.

This was excellent. Thanks so much for a GREAT chicken recipe that DOES NOT call for a condensed cream of something soup!!! Everybody loved it. Served with cheddar mashed potatoes and canned southwestern corn. Beautiful on the plate! I didn't have dried garlic, so I put fresh minced garlic in the bottom of the pan with the oil. I can't think of any way this recipe could be improved.

Wow, this reminded me of the broiled chickens that my Mom used to make when I was a kid.  Delicious!  Just a couple of changes: I cut the cinnamon in half.  I didn't "marinate it" because I didn't have time, but I can't imagine it made much of a difference since it's basically a dry rub.  I baked it at 350 convection (equals 375 in a regular oven) for exactly one hour and it was perfect.  Crispy, papery skin and perfect on the inside.  Yum!

excellent with a fruit salsa! 1 cup pineapple, 1 cup mango, 1/4 cup red bell pepper, 1/4 cup green bell pepper, 1/4 cup red onion, 1 tbsp fresh squeezed lime juice, 1/8 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp of sugar. Finely diced and mixed well. The flavors are great with the jerk spice!

Used a little bit less cinnamon and salt per other reviews and upped the cayenne to give it more of a kick. Good flavors. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts (because it's what I had on hand) and if I were to make again would follow the reviews that mix the spices with oil to make a marinade and see how it turned out.

I absolutely loved this receipe when it came out of the oven. I was so anxious to eat the left overs the next day and was disappointed. I will definitely make this again but only make just enough to eat that day.

Keeper! Put Chicken in ziploc bag with vegetable oil and shake. Then shake seasoning in bag, seal and shake. i let marinate for 2 hours. Took out of bag and made some more seasonings and sprinkled on top of chicken in foil lined pan. 350 convection for  1 hour 5 minutes then broiled for 2 minutes. Reduced cinnamon and increased cayenne still wasn't too spicy but spicy enough.

This was awesome!!! I omitted the cayenne pepper and replaced it with paprika and some seasoning salt because my kids (who ate way more than usual) cant handle anything even remotly spicy. I also just used powdered garlic. My husband was a firm believer that he didnt like jerk anything has changed his mind. This goes in the folder of things I highly recommend and will make agian.

I followed the recipe to the T and it had a bit to much cinnamon in it for our liking. My man is calling it "cinnamon chicken". I will use this recipe again only cut the cinnamon down.

Thanks for sharing this very good yet easy recipe. My family loved it. I made a couple of minor changes. I double the cayenne pepper and I cooked the chicken in the oven for 2 about hours.

We made this tonight using chicken breast pieces instead of a whole chicken and it turned out delicious! We paired it with Black Beans and Rice and Fried Plantains. A very yummy dinner that we will be making again!

Not too spicy at all (this from a hot-hater). I cut out all the pepper types but added 1/2 tsp red pepper. Left out the salt (low sodium diet) and was just scant on the 1/4 tsp ginger. A lot of recipes call for lime juice I will try adding that - maybe 1T? - the next time. Also will add the spices to oil and marinate in a moist medium/ziplock bag and maybe overnight as I didn't feel the dry rub was spreading like it should. Son complained it was not "real" jerk b/c of the non-heat but I enjoyed this-will work well for "special" occasion needs.

Very good and I loved that the chicken stayed moist. I will spice it up next time I make it but there will be a next time! Also I think if you enjoy this recipe it would be wise to make double or even triple the seasons to have for the next time you make it because it takes a lot of spices. Thanks for the recipe it was exactly what my husband wanted!

This chicken was delicious. I doubled this recipe for us. I put in half the amount of cinnamon allspice and nutmeg. I used olive oil and added it to the spices then I rubbed it into the chicken and let in marinate for a couple of hours. I cooked it about and hour and 45 minutes covered. Then I heated a little olive oil in a cast iron pan letting the oil get very hot then pan fried only the tops of the chicken for about a minute. This made the inside juicy and a crisp outside It was delicious! Thank you

The ratios are perfect! I am really pleased with this recipe thank you for posting it. I doubled everything for 3lbs chicken left it overnight and slow-cooked it in the crock pot the next day. My husband said it was the tastiest chicken he had ever eaten!

This was amazing--the combination of spices was definitely delicious! I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say it tasted quite authentic but it was yummy! I will continue to use this recipe and can't wait to try the seasonings out in other recipes.

i created an account just to say that this is a GREAT recipe! I had searched everywhere for a simple but packed with heat and flavor jerk rub and this is it! It has all the spices we typically already have. I've made it twice and this time I tripled the recipe so I could put it in my regular rotation because we loved it so much! thanks for sharing.

My family really liked this chicken! It was not at all spicy - I might add a little extra kick next time I make it but it was pretty clear in the description that it wasn't meant to be "spicy" I used 5 chicken leg quarters cut into legs and thighs in the recipe because that is what I had and the cook time was perfect. Thanks for a new family staple.

I made this as is except for all spice since I didn't have any. Instead I used a cajun seasoning blend. Not too shabby. It's not quite jerk since it's hardly spicy at all but it is delicious. The extra step for broil is what adds that extra kick.

This recipe is sooooo good. Only problem is i have to triple the ingredients to make enough for the amount of chicken i want to bake. Cooking the chicken low and slow makes it so tender.

Excellent! Baked legs and thighs and turned out perfectly - juicy and moist. The only thing I changed was the temperature: baked at 380º for 50 minutes due to time constraints. I'll make again thanks for sharing.

I followed the directions exactly. Only slight change was I didn't have dried garlic, so I minced up some fresh garlic and sprinkled it on the bottom of the pan with the oil before baking the chicken. The taste/seasoning is wonderful and the skin was a little crispy with juicy, tender meat inside. I did not have any leftovers. =)

This was my second time preparing this recipe. I found the thyme overwhelming so I cut back on it. I also omitted the cinnamon as others recommended. I added 1 teaspoon of Adobo seasoning to the recipe. I used boneless chicken tenderloins and wings. I marinated the coated chicken in olive oil and minced garlic in the refrigerator over night and baked it tonight. My husband and I were delighted with the results this time. I served the chicken with a mixture of seasoned rice and corn. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe this will be a regular treat in our home.

Looking for something different to do with chicken. So good. I only had 4 pieces of dark meat chicken. I didn't have time to do the marinating part so I packed it all on one side and baked as directed. I left the chicken skin side-up. We so enjoyed it this way. Will be making it again. Thank-you! Oh and we thought the spice blend was spot-on. So this gets five stars just for the spice blend alone not even counting how good it was on the chicken.

This was very good! Not true hardcore jerk chicken which is what I really liked about it. I did follow some other reviews and halved the salt and cinnamon. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe of the seasonings as it didn't seem like enough for my large chicken. Alot of reviews mentioned putting the oil in with the spices but the dry rub is part of what's great as it forms a wonderful crust. Put the dry rub on then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to get a good seal. Perfect!

Out of my normal jerk I tried this recipe. As is not bad but jerk uses scotch bonnet peppers not cayenne to bring the heat. NOT being critical of this one...it was good. But if you're a jerk seasoning fan I suggest ordering Walkerswood Jamaican Jerk Seasoning (get 2 jars) and Walkerswood Jerk Barbeque Sauce. Easy to use although it takes a bit of practice to get the heat correct but once you figure it out you'll use it in a LOT of dishes including chili spaghetti hamburgers chicken..and it makes for an unreal crockpot-cooked pulled pork barbeque!

This chicken came out great. Added a little water as another reviewer suggested just to thin the soup out a bit. The only problem I had with this recipe is that the flour batter becomes so thick which was wonderful for dinner (nice and crunchy) however this recipe did not serve well as left overs. Once all the crunch sits overnight in the frig it turns thick and gooey.

Wow you talk about a great flavor. I even screwed up and put the oil in the seasoning mix (ran home for a half hour lunch was hurrying & not paying attention!) and had to marinate it like that but honestly I dont think it couldve turned out any better. It was awesome! Thanks!!!

Oh my gosh this was perfect for tonight! Yummy and easy to make though I cut up some chicken breasts into pieces. Since I didn't have any vegetable oil I used olive oil instead but used 1/4 cup of it. I also took the advice of putting the seasonings chicken pieces and oil into a bag. Marinated for 1 hour and yum =3

Very delicious! Love the spices. Pretty much followed the recipe but we checked our chicken about 30 minutes early and it seemed to be done already so be careful about that lest you want burnt or dried up chicken.

My husband gives it 4 stars but I give it 5 stars; this chicken was delicious!! I now live in Tampa FL and I've been trying to find a jerk chicken recipe like back home in CT; this is the closest I've found!! Mmmm. My husband is very picky and barely eats anything so to have him say it was pretty good AND clean his plate really says something!! I used 10 wings and a few skinless breasts.

Wow - this was GOOD! I didn't have time to marinate the meat in the rub mixture but even just five minutes of sitting worked out fine. We ate this with fried plantains and refried black beans with rum and pineapple juice to drink:)

I made this dish last night and with Thanksgiving coming up next week my family now wants a "jerk" Turkey. My chicken marinated for under 1 hour omitted the onion powder (didn't have any) and combined the oil with the spices. For the short time allowed to marinate the chicken was very flavorful. A definite keeper!

I have never had jerk chicken before but always wanted to try it. I became extremely cautious when I saw the recipe called for a lot of the same ingredients I use to make my pumpkin pie. I ended up chickening out and only using half of the cinnamon/brown sugar that the recipe called for. This came out sooo good! I was so scared to take a bite but once I did I ate so much. I also added more cayenne (I love hot stuff.) The chicken was so moist and full of flavor. I served it with black beans and white rice. Will def. make again.

I made this for dinner last night and it was awesome! My husband and son loved it and are still talking about it today. I added some fresh chopped garlic to the oil in the bottom of my baking dish as someone else had suggested and doubled the seasoning. The chicken cooked perfectly the skin was crunchy it was soooo tasty. I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't have time to marinate more than 10 minutes but this was great anyway! I doubled the amount of thyme. I was nervous about the lack of heat some other reviewers commented on so I doubled the pepper but that was too hot for me! Next time I'll use the normal amount of pepper. Great recipe thanks!

This was delicious!! My boyfriend had been asking for jerk chicken for months so I finally sifted through all the jerk recipes and after reading reviews and comparing ingredients this one seemed perfect. And it was! Not too hot but great heat. (I actually doubled the cayenne pepper it called for because he like things pretty hot). It had a perfect blend of spices and herbs. I used much less oil than called for and used 1 Tablespoon of fresh lemon juice (out of OJ) to help thin out the rub. I marinated it overnight in the fridge and baked it in the morning. Served it with lightly buttered steamed jasmine rice and it was delish. I think next time I'll try roasting some potatoes green & red bell peppers and serving it with those. I was asked to make this every week since it was just so delicious. If you are looking for a well balanced jerk then this is the recipe for you. I would recommend adding a little citrus juice to the rub instead of the oil though. It didn't miss the oil and the acidity helped the meat stay tender and balanced the other flavors out. I also added a little classic poultry herb seasoning since I was short on the thyme.

Great Recipe!! The only thing I am going to change is to cover the chicken while baking to keep it more moist then uncover near the end when I turn on the broiler to crisp it up. I also added some crused red pepper for a little more heat (personal preference). Other than the fact that the chicken was a little dry it was fantastic.

This chicken was AMAZING! I don't know if I would call it "jerk" chicken as it tasted nothing like the jerk chicken I have had...BUT it is amazing in it's own right. I followed the recipe as directed minus the nutmeg as I didn't have any. And instead of baking the chicken I threw the pieces directly on the grill. It was SO juicy and moist! It's the best chicken I have ever made and my fiance agreed. THANK YOU!

I had to feed 12 people so I quadrupled (4X) the recipe and instead of using a whole chicken I used boneless skinless breasts cut into thick strips and put on skewers on the grill. (Just like the jerk chicken we had in Jamaica) It was good but next time I make it I am reducing the salt to teaspoons instead of tablespoons. It was way too salty! Otherwise it was very good.

This is awesome! Some changes that seemed to be good: adding the juice of half a lime to the marinade baking on a sliced leek which got fried in the oil and jerk-seasoned and I used a thermometer to avoid overcooking.

Oh I wish I tasted this before I cooked my chicken with it because all I could taste was the salt because it overpowered everything else. I used fresh garlic and onion and doubled the cayenne because I like things spicy but the salt just killed it. I will try this recipe again but use way less salt!

It was pretty good. I used boneless-skinless chicken thighs and coconut oil and only marinated it 20 minutes. The recipe is only very mildly spicy so have some extra cayenne on the table if you like it hotter. I also cooked some carrots and mini peppers with it and they were good too.

I had several pieces of chicken so i used the calculator for 10 servings followed Princess Jenna and poured the oil in the bag with the spices. I nearly doubled the cayenne... oh i also used fresh garlic and ground thyme. Looked great tasted good was'nt hot enuff; however the description did say not to hot... I'll definitely try it again pouring the oil in the baking dish.

My husband and I love this recipe! I have to make it every once in a while or he will start asking for it. Actually I'm making it today. I always prepare it exactly like the recipe says and it comes out great everytime. I don't cook my chicken as long as it says though because I don't make as much as the recipe calls for.

Tripled the recipe for use with four pounds of drumsticks. I added a can of coconut milk and later took the defatted pan juice and used that to make rice. Served the drumsticks on top of the rice. I really dont think I needed the oil at all as I poured off about a cup (!!!)after the chicken was done. I am going to do this again except: quadruple (or more) the recipe and add a bit more Cayenne along with a sliced onion. I will not use the pan dripping to make the rice but will thicken ever so slightly and pour over the rice. I think at that point is should be something like what we had on Coki beach.. which by the way deserves SIX stars LOL.

Great flavour not spicy enough and we doubled the cayenne. We also found that they looked dry when they were sitting so we added a splash of Jack Daniels and also a half of lime fresh squeezed. My son said they were awesome and he doesn't eat much of anything! I am sure with ALOT more cayenne it will be a 5 recipe. Thanks!

Nice and simple. Chicken turned out great. Paired nicely with coconut rice. I'd almost double the amount of rub & get it under the skin really well.

Very good! I didn't marinade due to time and I used boneless breast and thighs instead and baked it at 400 for about 20/25 min. Came out great! I might just play with the cayenne and the brown sugar to adjust the spicy and sweet mix. Overall I will save this recipe and make again.

made this dish last night I've followed all the direction and this dish was not what I was hoping for. I will not be making this dish ever again. I hate wasting food give it to our dogs and they wouldn't even eat it. #EXTREMELYDISAPPOINTED

Used 2 large bone in skin on breasts. Will try blsl strips and a LOT more cayenne next time. I thought the flavors were balanced we did not find the cinnamon to be too much but we love cinnamon. Served with mashed sweet potatoes with jalapeno and cilantro and steamed broccoli.

Halved the oil and doubled all seasonings except for cinnamon. Mixed everything up in a ziploc bag to coat the chicken let it marinate for an hour then baked it. I used pounded out chicken breasts so I cut about 20-25 minutes off the bake time...turned out delicious!:)

Made this for a Caribbean potluck. Pretty tasty but a little too mild. Jerk chicken usually has habanero peppers in it so I'll probably add those next time.

I'm a vegetarian and I never taste the meat that I make... i made this for my family however and I could smell how it would have tasted!! my boyfriend prefers some heat so I simply opened a scotch bonnet pepper and rubbed it on top of his chicken. He said it tasted as if it had been baked right on and gave it the heat he likes where as everyone else prefers the non spicy! I served this with coconut rice and peas and a warm butternut squash salad garnished with lime and voilà!! I did make a marinade adding the spices to olive oil I used chicken breasts instead as well.

This is the second time making this great recipe. I found it a bit light on the spices the first time around so I doubled the spices and oil with my 4 lbs of gigantic chicken breasts (did not double the salt). I put everything together in a zip lock bag and marinated all day. Baked until they were dark brown and sizzling. Great!!

Very good although I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and baked at 375 (rushed) and it still tasted great. Next time I think I'll try putting the rub directly on the meat (under the skin) and see how that goes... I don't like eating the skin.

Pretty yummy! I really enjoyed this recipe! I purchased split chicken breasts (6)to make this recipe and doubled the amounts of everything and served with brown rice. I forgot to get a veggie- broccoli would've rounded the meal off nicely(whooo hooo- dream big). I did add the oil to the spices and coated the chicken then refrigerated for an hour- that's all I had time for- baked nearly 2 hours and everyone liked it. This was something different to do with chicken and I will use this recipe again.

I made a whole bunch of this and froze them away before cooking. Defrost for two days in the fridge before cooking. Definitely came out better the first time when a hadn't overcooked it. Much saltier when overcooked. Loved it the first time though but very mild..kids could eat it. Husband was disapointed that it wasn't spicy.

I cut the salt in half and added a little more cayenne. Didnt have time to marinate (I was too hungry) so I threw it in the oven right after rubbing. Just before turning the broiler on I basted the chicken with the juices in the bottom. Turned out great skin was nice and crisp. I think maybe next time I might cut the cinnamon in half it seemed to overpower the rest of the flavors. Other than that it was great quick and easy. Thanks! Oh and I didnt use a whole chicken just breasts with bone and skin on.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight. I thought it was pretty good. I recommend rubbing spice on by hand rather then shaking in a bag. I ended up not having enough spice so made some more of the rub which turn out to be too much. Next time I will just rub the skin of the chicken and not bother putting any spice to the bottom of the chicken. I did what another reviewer did I also poured the cooking oil over the spice rubbed chicken and flip half way through marinating stage (2 hours). I cooked with some tin foil on bottom of cooking dish to aid with clean up. I cooked to exact timing of recipe. I will be making this again.

I gave this a try before making it for a family gathering and now I can't wait to see their faces when they have their first bite of this scrumptious chicken! For my trial run I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I will do for the gathering along with wings and thighs as I want to taste the crisped chicken skin. Thanks so so much for this marvelous recipe! It is such a treat!

I used three large bone in chicken breast and doubled the spices in the rub. I was out of cinnamon and ginger so omitted it. I'll grt some for next time. I recommend checking after an hour do see if the chicken is cooked through mine was a little dry after cooking for full amount of time. Make sure to keep a close whatch when broiling or the skin will burn. I learned the hard way. Was delicious anyway. I served it with fresh green beans and new potatoes. I will make this again.

Mmm I can't wait to try this recipe on the BBQ! Tastes fantastic coming out of the oven and looks beautiful as well. My mods were: - no allspice (b/c missing from pantry) - mixed oil and spices/herbs in a large ziploc bag - also added about 1/8 cup of mango habanero sauce (purchased from Save-On Meats in Vancouver) - dumped 10 chicken thighs (skin on but with fat trimmed off) into the ziploc bag and rubbed/massaged until all chicken pieces were in contact with the marinade - refrigerated for 3 hours then let it rest at room temperature for about 25 minutes. - baked in preheated oven for 50 minutes and broiled for 3 minutes So flavourful! Definitely will make again.

Best chicken recipe I’ve found on the Internet. The spices are perfect. The only thing I changed was I made a double batch and added a teaspoon of smoked paprika. 

I’m going to try making this in a smoker next time. I think it’d be perfect for that.

I made the spice mix X4 I like to have extra in the cabinet. I cut up whole chicken and sprinkled twice the amount of spice mix it called for and I thought it turned out perfect. I let it marinate in a bag for 8 hours before baking uncovered and there was no need to broil. I plan to make it often loved it.

Delicious. Simply delicious! I will make this again in an instant. the only alteration was instead of cooking in oil I brushed the top with oil and broiled for 5 minutes at the end making the outside crispy. I also added a sqeeze of fresh lime when finished.

made this last night and was very pleased even my picky husband said it was delish! i thought the sugar and salt amounts were a little small but these amounts are bang on! i followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using boneless skinless chicken breasts as that's what i had on hand. my suggestion here would be to be careful of the breasts drying out as mine did my fault i think this recipe is better suited for skin on chicken to give this delicious spice blend the wow factor it deserves. I will definitely be making this delicious recipe again and again!

The cinnamon taste was obvious but I liked it! I may scale it down a bit next time but I loved this chicken! I didn't put much cayenne and I might use more next time too but I would highly recommend this recipe!

I had a craving for some jerk chicken and came across this recipe and decided to give it a shot. and to my surprise it turned out really really well! in the future I believe I would only make one modification and that would be to add a bit more cayenne pepper in for a bit more kick. Other than that great recipe!

Used a full tsp. of cayenne used a packet of stevia instead of brown sugar and used the oil and 1/4 cup spiced rum in the marinade and the spices were perfect for us heat lovers!

This is my first time trying jerk chicken as well as making it. I followed it pretty close to the directions. I used a zip lock bag though to marinate and used EVOO inside the bag to actually marinate otherwise it would have just been a rub. I also used EVOO to coat the pan instead of vegetable oil. It marinated for 3 hours. I also cooked it on 375 for 45 minutes and used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. It was awesome except I will scale back on the salt next time. It was a little much. Cayenne and cinnamon were perfect. I hardly tasted cinnamon in it which is strange cause a lot of reviewers mentioned there was too much? 1/4 of a teaspoon isn't very much at all. I paired the chicken with homemade coconut rice. Complimented it very well. Will make again. Thank you!

This was wonderful! I added a bit more cayenne and made the dry rub into a paste then marinated boneless skinless chicken thighs for a few hours with it and grilled them on a nonstick grill pan. Will be making this one again. And to the reviewer that thought it would taste like cajun...why? It's jerk not cajun. It shouldn't taste at all like cajun.

Since I made about 48 wings I made several batches of the rub. I should've let them totally thaw before marinating overnight because the ones at the bottom sat in liquid. But once baked they were truly perfect. Next time I may cut down the brown sugar. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was excellent! Comparable to the seasoning on the jerk chicken at a local Caribbean Restaurant. I did not have time to marinate the chicken and it still came out awesome. Next time I will marinate it. Served with rice and black beans.

The only changes I made were that I cut the amount of cinnamon in half and I doubled the amount of Chyanne pepper. Other than that it was delicious!! I've already made it twice now! It's so simple and will definitely be making it again over summer and I'll probably try to grill it!

I make up a cup of seasoning mix at a time - it gets used quickly. Whenever I want a fast dinner I just dredge a chicken breast in a tablespoon of seasoning and bake. I've also used this to cook steak (ribeye) turkey in rice pilaf and generally wherever I want a slightly sweet/heat taste in my food. Reminds me of Levantine 'baharat' for my fellow middle eastern cooks. Tastes great as a dry marinade or as a last addition before going into the oven. The brown sugar caramelizes so omitting it will change the final texture. The main flavors you get will be from the allspice and nutmeg.

Made this for the wife and two kids (6 &10). Everyone loved it BUT the flavor of jerk was only on the skin. Inside the chicken only tasted like bland cooked chicken. How the heck can I get the flavor THROUGHOUT the entire chicken? I've had it at restaurants like that. We even let the rub sit on the chicken in the fridge for 4 hours. So disappointed because the flavor is wonderful.

Recommend cook time should no more than one hour. Glad I checked and didn't go recommended cook time. Would have been a crispy chick.

Broil was not needed as skin was crispy.

I added all spices as written to a plastic bag with chicken cutlets. Let marinade in fridge for about 3 hours. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes. So flipping good. Everyone in my house loved it. Going in regular rotation here.

This was my first time trying out jerk chicken. It was very delicious. I let it cook for about two hours. I glazed the top with a small mixture of honey, barbecue sauce, and mustard and then broiled it. It was completely fantastic. I have not tasted better jerk chicken. I was so proud.

I marinated boneless chicken breasts in the oil and seasonings for a few hours. I baked the chicken with the oil/seasoning mix on it at 350 for 45 minutes. It was flavorful and my family loved it including my husband who doesn't like spicy food. The seasoning was mild in my opinion. Next time I'm going to buy some chicken with the skin on and follow the recipe exactly.

We enjoyed this meal. I used 2.75 pounds of meat and I thought the amount of spice was just right. (I was out of thyme so I subbed 1/4 teaspoon marjoram--no other changes.) I let the chicken marinate in the baking dish. I poured the oil over it right before baking tilting the dish to distribute more evenly. Besides reducing dirty dishes I think this helped make the chicken more moist than it would have been with all the oil at the bottom. I forgot to broil at the end but it was fine the way it was. It only took an hour to bake.

Simply Amazing! I followed the instructions verbatim and the chicken turned out delicious. The measurements were on point but I added the oil on top of the chicken. I allowed my chicken to marinate for a few hours and it still turned out so good. Not too spicy or sweet but just right. I must say I was a bit skeptic about the title "Perfect baked jerk chicken" but just as the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover so I tried it and I'm so glad I did. I loved it.

Made the rub as is and used boneless skinless chicken breast, so the cook time was different- but this was AWSOME!  A little too spicy for most of my family, though, so next time I will cut back on the cayenne and black paper a touch. Definitely a keeper!

Yum! This is my new favorite jerk recipe. I've made complicated jerk chicken marinades in the past and this is so easy and fast! I had to substitute ground thai chili for the cayenne pepper which was extra spicy. My 1 year old loved it too! I've made this a few times now and I love it!

Excellent recipe!! Very delicious!!  Me and the family grabbed it up so fast, I forget to take a picture.  I did double the amount of Cayenne Pepper, for more spicy!!
