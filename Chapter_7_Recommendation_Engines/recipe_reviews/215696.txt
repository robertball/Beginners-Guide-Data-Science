Outstanding! Love how the ends of the outer leaves become almost crispy while the rest of the halved head takes on a wilted texture but still has crunch. After taking it off the grill let it sit for about 10 minutes to give it time to take on its unique texture. I used "Low Fat Buttermilk Ranch Dressing" by JPSMOMMIE from this site. My husband does not like blue cheese so I did not use it but did add some crushed walnuts. Makes a nice presentation too!

I can not acurately rate this recipe since I don't have a grill to cook the escarole on. I used an oven and the final result was edible but nobody else like it except me. Once I get my grill back, I will definitely make again.

From the picture, the greens look more like Romaine lettuce.  Either way, loved making this as a grilled Caesar Salad!

Delicious.   Substitute Romaine and drizzle with home made Caesar Dressing - lots of anchovies.   Grilled flavor brings out taste of dressing.   A few sud ried tomatoes add depth

Surprisingly good. Going to try lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper the next time we make it.

This is a classic in my home during the long fabulous Las Vegas grilling season.  It's super easy, always delicious and goes with anything you've popped on the grill - steak, seafood, chicken, grilled veggie plate.  The only thing I do differently is to use blue cheese dressing with the blue cheese crumbles.  Definitely adds a 'special', gourmet touch to your meal and tastes great.
