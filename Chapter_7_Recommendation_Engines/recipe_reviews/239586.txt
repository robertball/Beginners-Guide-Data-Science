I did not find the chocolate philly cream cheese, so I used regular cream cheese. It came out great! Very moist!

Super easy to make...
make  cake as directed on box..
take rest of ingredients  ..cream cheese  sugar  water and egg.... mix together  and   spoon that into  batter
..... I used more sugar   twice the amount as it wasn't  sweet   enough for me.... 
also I added chocolate to the  cream cheese  (to make it  look  like the  photos) by taking 3 tbsp of  cocoa powder and 1tbsp of oil  (mix together  - you make a  melted semi sweet chocolate) that  you can add to  cream  cheese - while  mixing  and make a  yummy  chocolate version...... Spoon it  all over the  cake in pan.
  I used spatula   I had in hand to swirl it thru batter making   cool  texture..... smelled  delicious  baking .
 It is  yummy   ....super fast   clean up.
  I will make it  again.....
