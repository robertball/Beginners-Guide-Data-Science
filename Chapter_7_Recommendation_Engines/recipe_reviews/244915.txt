Yet another wonderful smoothy from the Smoothie Goddess. I admit I used fresh banana and pineapple instead of frozen so I replaced the water for ice. I really enjoyed it. The almond butter is delicate yet distinct and just enough to set this apart from your usual smoothie. I also like the velvet texture created by the avocado without hijacking flavour in any way. Thank you for the recipe.
