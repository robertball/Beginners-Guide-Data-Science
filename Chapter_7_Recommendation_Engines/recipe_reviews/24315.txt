This is one of my favorites,  I'm used to seeing it with a little paprika, and no sugar,  so when I started craving it, and looked up the recipe I was a little suprised.  Since I try to stay away from as much processed sugar as I can (no always sucessful with that...lol) I went ahead and left that out, but still was soooooo yummy.   I stirred the seasonings into the cream, and tossed the cabbage and cream together in a mixing bowl before putting it in the casserole dish.  Had an open(read:stale...lol) package of crackers in the cupbord, so smashed them up to use for my crumb topping,  and added a little bit of parmasean to the top just to be creative.    This recipe is always recieved well, and is mostly goof-proof!

I had some shredded cabbage in the fridge, so made half of this recipe.  If you want a bold side dish, this isn't for you.  But if you're looking for something to, perhaps, complement a bold entree, this is it!  My husband said this doesn't overwhelm anything, but still has a flavor (well put, I thought).  Followed the recipe to the letter and used panko bread crumbs for the topping.  It's just mellow, creamy, rich with a hint of freshly grated nutmeg.  Don't tell the kids this is cooked cabbage because they'll never figure this one out.  Thoroughly enjoyed this.

I give it one start because it was easy. I can't however give it anymore than that. My husband and I found this quite bad. We couldn't even finish our serving. After seeing the reviews, I thought that this would be something we would like, but it isn't for us. I followed the directions to a tee, but after it was all said and done, I can't think of anyway to improve this recipes. I love creamed turnips and thought this might be like it, but it isn't. Thanks for sharing, but I will continue to look for a different kinda way of fixing cabbage.

Fabulous! For low carb, I used two heaping teaspoons of Splenda and as other mixed it all together in a bowl before pouring into the casserole dish. To spice up the bread crumb topping I mixed 3/4 C each bread crumbs, shredded emmentaler, and shredded parmesan. My hubby and I both loved it!

This is WONDERFUL!  I only had half and half, so added some shredded Cheddar cheese to the dish to thicken it a bit more, Panko crumbs on top, and the only mistake I made was in cutting the recipe to 4 servings for just the 2 of us--could have eaten more, lesson learned:)

I'm not a big fan of cabbage but I loved this recipe!  I made it exactly as written except I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain.  I liked the addition of the sugar, it brought out a subtle sweetness to the dish.  (I have a bit of a sweet tooth.)  I can't wait to get more cabbage & cream so I can make this again.

What a great way to use up "economical" cabbage!  We loved this! Didn't have bread crumbs so used up the remainder of a bag of tortilla chips broken up for the topping.  Delicious!  Cathy L.

I made half the recipe following the directions exactly. I found it verrrry bland. I added more salt which didn't help then stirred in some freeze dried chives. It helped a little, but I won't be making this again.

I made the recipe as written although I did increase the oven temp to 350 - only because I wanted to be sure the cabbage was cooked through. Very nice mild flavor with a bit of sweetness. I served it with pork loin that I made in the crock pot and it was a nice marriage between the two dishes. I would make this again. YUM!

I chopped fresh cabbage instead of shredding it - so that may have been the problem.  It didn't soak up the juice after cooking an hour and didn't have enough flavor for my taste.  I added most of it to a potatoe chowder I made the next day= fabulous!

When I read this recipe I thought it sounded like an unusual combo (the cabbage, sugar & nutmeg in particular) but when I read the reviews I thought maybe everything would just work together. Well....I was wrong. I made this as written and it just did not appeal to my family. Everyone agreed that it tasted like a pumpkin pie made with cabbage..
 I used the other half of the head of cabbage to make the Creamy Cabbage with Noodles recipe from this site, which we all found to be much more to our taste.

If your looking for a new take on cabbage, you have to try this.  The recipe was extremely easy to follow.  I will definitely be making this again. I found it to be a little too rich for me,so I'll cut back the sugar a little, and may try to add something with a little acid.

Cabbage was very sweet and creamy. I will make this again, with one change.  I will use fresh buttered bread crumbs.

Followed the recipe.  I think the recipe calls for too much breadcrumbs as my casserole looked nothing like the picture.  The cream added no richness to the flavor (if you can call it flavor).  We dumped the whole casserole minus a couple of bites.  We love cabbage but not like this!

I have made this numerous times, but I omit the sugar. I don't know why it's included as an ingredient. I use Ritz or panko crumbs with a little shredded cheddar. Delicious.

I made this to use up some leftover cabbage.  Sliced it very thin and, as I had just used the last of my nutmeg, I sprinkled it with pumpkin pie spice (actually worked quite well) and only added ½ the sugar due to suggestions from other reviews.  I liked it and my husband who initially turned up his nose, had two big helpings.

Nice recipe and added a few things that my family likes.

Made recipe as it was with a little less sugar -  Mixed in a little garlic & 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream.   Had some turkey bacon in the freezer & some pepperoni - added on top &e mixed shredded cheese I had on hand.

Thanks ... it was GREAT !

the only thing I changed was I made this in cupcake pans to be able to freeze it easily, This is a recipe I can see as a starter making it in smaller portions and remembering the time will be shorter if made smaller. You have to try this as it is delicious and very versatile.

Made this recipe to use up some shredded cabbage, so decided to try this.  This is not bold in flavour but will compliment a bold flavoured main dish.  Served this with Soy Sauce Chicken.  great combo.
