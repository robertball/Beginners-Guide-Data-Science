These were great! We could hardly tell they were whole wheat! They were so easy to make that I will not be buying them premade anymore! Plus they are a lot cheaper to make. I used the round cookie cutters for the first ones but it was a big pain so after that I just poured them onto the skillet into as round of a shape as possible which was pretty easy to do because they don't really spread out. I also used almond milk instead of regular milk because that is all we have. You couldn't even tell. They tasted great plain, with butter, with jam, with eggs benedict and with a fried egg, bacon and cheese sandwich. I will be making these often!

Very good, I use these instead of English Muffins, only a few ingredients instead of all the stuff in the store bought ones.  They store well in the freezer too!

Works fabulously. I will never make pancakes again -- all I want is crumpets!!! Like another reviewer, I used almond milk with great success. The texture of these is incredible. I didn't have rings so I cooked them like pancakes.

I tried this recipe and a traditional white flour one I found elsewhere on the Internet. This was by far my favorite as it was much more flavorful. We are doing an English Afternoon Tea for 8th graders after reading Great Expectations, and I'll be cooking these fresh on an electric griddle during the event. Thanks a bunch for the recipe! UPDATE 2/26/17: I did buy crumpet rings, and they do support the batter to give you that high rise you want for crumpets, but you can easily use small tin cans with both ends removed. I found that a little butter dripped in around the rings while they were cooking helped with ring removal. The electric griddle gave that low even temperature that prevents burning on the bottom. I used small tongs to remove the rings as they do get hot. Between 2-3 Tbs of batter each worked for me, and according to British sites, these aren't supposed to be split like English Muffins. You eat them whole with clotted cream and lemon curd if you want to go with tradition. Recipes for the toppings are available online as well, and also worked out well.

This recipe was excellent and it allows for "wiggle room" with ingredients with is nice. I had to use almond milk because that is what I had on hand but everything else was per the recipe. These cooked up beautifully! Fluffy...dense and moist like an English muffin. So good with butter or, in my case, apple butter. I will make these again but I will experiment with quinoa flour (for more protein) and maybe cinnamon and cranberries. The only "trouble" I had was that I didn't have an electric griddle so I had to guage my temps on the stove top using a griddle pan. While they came out wonderully, I had to really watch them because if they stove heat is too high, it will brown too quickly and not cook through completely. With some trial and error I was able to figure out what worked on my stove. Lastly, I used both rings and "free form" and both came out great. I think size-wise, using only 2 tablespoons per crumpet worked for me. Advice if you are using rings, try to use ones with handles as they get pretty hot and can be awkward to pick up with an oven mitt.

I had to try these as I'm so tired of store bought English muffins that taste like cardboard. I don't have an electric griddle, so I had to guess at the temperature. I allowed the griddle to warm on med - low for a few minutes along with the rings. I followed the recipe as written and they are delicious. I tried the rings in both directions since it wasn't specific. I found it best starting upside down. When you turn the crumpets over, the rings just lift /fall off.

This was my first attempt and it worked.  I used wide jar lids and guessed on the skillet heat. I suggest you use 3 or 3.5 Tablespoons of the batter/sponge per lid.

Thank you very much for this recipe and for breakfast! Everything about the cooking time was confusing, I used an oven instead and did the best I could to make them perfect. Regardless, they were splendorous! I smothered them in jam lmao, but little of what I could taste from the crumpets was yeast and that's about it. Still great, though!

Easy enough to make but had my trouble with cooking. For me it took much longer than recipe shows. And even when done they were very chewy.  I will say the ones I split and toasted were very good.  But not enough to want to do this recipe again.

These are wonderful and only about 80 calories. A great recipe for those using only whole wheat flour. Especially good if you freshly grind your own wheat berries.
