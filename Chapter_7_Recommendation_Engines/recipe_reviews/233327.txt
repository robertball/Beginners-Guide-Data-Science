Delicious! Nice flavor, chef John's recipes never let me down :) light and delicious. I used real vanilla extract not sure if imitation would of worked. Also used regular Philadelphia cream cheese as I couldn't find any mascarpone... Came
Out wonderful!

I cut recipe in half and used store bought graham pie  crust. ...decorated in circle with strawberries the center circle with blueberries. I used 1/4 cp of sugar in with cream cheese then 1/3 cp powdered sugar in whipped cream....delicious. ...omitted lemon completely. I made original recipe 1st...not sweet enough and lemon didn't taste right in this recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe.  We'd have liked it a little sweeter. Next time I will add a little powdered sugar to the marscapone mixture or drizzle with a flavored syrup (caramel or strawberry, maybe?). But it was very easy and tastes good!

I made this for a 4th of July family BBQ. Everyone loved it. I needed more servings so made in a 9x13 dish changing servings from 12 to 15. I used chocolate graham crackers and didn't add sugar. It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very easy. I personally felt like the lemon was too much, but I am not a big fan of lemon. My guests, however, loved this. I had no leftovers and they were left wanting more. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it was delicious. The first time I made it was for our annual forth of July party. Everyone liked it and my dad kept going back for more. He liked that it was not too sweet. My mother thought it was too lemony and would have preferred a "real" cheesecake. The second time I made it I increased the vanilla and decreased the lemon. I think if you complete omit the lemon it would be too plain. When I made it the last time I used apple and pear because they are in season. Still delicious. It is a really simple recipe that just gets better as it sits in the fridge. Thank you Chef John!

I just used two packages of cream cheese and refrigerated it over night, then placed fruit right before eating. I used imitation vanilla and it was fine, I think the fresh lemon juice made a big difference in the overall flavor. YUMmmm. Festive and perfect for a hot 4th of July day!

DB LOVED it! I thought it was good and appreciated it wasn't to sweet, a cooling & refreshing dessert for the 4th. The only thing I did different was to leave out the cocoa powder.

I haven't made this, but I know I would like it. I'm sure it could us a touch more sugar.  I don't even like things too sweet, but 2Tbps in the crust and 1/3 cup in the cheesecake really is very little sugar.  But I will try it exactly as written for a 4th of July party.  Since we can't comment on each other's postings, to the person who said the strawberries bled color  -(1) no two anythings are exactly alike - maybe you're strawberries were juicier as they were a different strain.  and (2) you can always put them on a paper towel for a few minutes to absorb some of the juice.

I wanted to like this recipe, it's a flag cake after all but I found the cheese cake a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, just bland.

I liked this a lot, and it was easy, and a big hit. I gave it four stars because I feel like the lemon flavor from the juice didn't belong. I'll make it again, but without the lemon juice.

I liked the texture, but found the cheesecake bland, and didn't care for the lemon rind, nor lemon flavoring within the cake.

My grandpa just loves cheesecake, if you give him the whole thing it will be gone in a matter of minutes. He is 93 years old and was in World War II, I make this for him on special occasions and he absolutely loves it! ??

I made this without the cocoa powder and lemon zest, also instead of using mascarpone I just used more cream cheese, I've never been a huge fan of cheesecake, but I made this for a 4th of July bbq at the in-law's, everyone loved it, including myself!

I made it exactly as stated. I took to my Sunday School class and everyone loved it. Time consuming to make but I will certainly make it again.  Not too sweet. Plan on making using different design for other occasions.

Not as good as baked but easy on a hot day! 
Filling: I simplified and added the dense cheesiness that we like by using four bricks of cream cheese and replacing the whipped cream with 8 oz. Frozen whipped topping, which lasts longer without breaking down or getting runny.  I at least doubled and possibly tripled the lemon juice and did not use vanilla. Taste for sugar. If you add extra cream cheese, you may want this sweeter; we were fine with it not overly sweet.
Crust: I used one whole package graham crackers (36 little crackers if broken apart), crushed, which probably amounts to a bit more than the recommended 1.5 cups. And I found I only needed 5 the. margarine, not 6.

Love it. I made this for the 4th of July. Instead of mixing regular graham crackers with coco powder I used chocolate graham crackers. Otherwise I followed the rest of the instructions. It was delicious but could have been a tad bit sweeter.

It was good. I used a 9x13 pan instead and it worked well. It could’ve used a little bit more sugar and the whipped cream and cheese mixture didn’t fully combine.

We liked this dessert.  After reading others’ reviews, I used used cream cheese only, left out the lemon, and increased the vanilla a little bit.  Put fruit on at the last minute,  using firm raspberries instead of strawberries.  It wasn’t overly sweet which was fine with us

Yes - I didn't want the berries so sour, so I made 4 T. strawberry jelly (or another one like raspberry jelly), 2 T. water & put in microwave 30 seconds.  Use to brush over the top of the berries (it was really sour by July in FL)  & it makes it better & helps the berries stay on the cake.  Looked really great on that!  I was not expected that this "cake" would be better than I thought - the cream layer was just needed something - the lemon zest & juice didn't seem to flavor it all.  And the  crust would have been better as a regular graham cracker crumb - butter, sugar, etc.  After all that I said this, it was a pretty wood flag cake & if I changed a little bit of the recipe, I'd like it better!  Then again...I USED to be a good cook - lately, watch me burn water!!!!!

I made it exactly as written and it was good. A hit with my 4th of July guests. It was light and creamy. The pan size is a little funny though. My pans are all 9 x 13, so that is what I had to use. So, it was a little thinner than I would have liked. Still very good. Chef John would not steer you wrong.

The lemon zest makes this amazing.  My kiddos didn't think it was sweet enough, which is just fine for the hubs and I.  It's all ours.  :)

I used a 9X13, which made it a trifle (get it?) thinner than it would be at its best, but it was still amazing.

This was fairly easy to make and a HUGE HIT at our 4th of July party!! I made it exactly as written.  I worried it might not be sweet enough, however once the flavors sat overnight it was perfect!! Cold, refreshing and just sweet enough!!!

Easy to make and not super sweet, so everyone can enjoy it.  I made it with just some mixed berries on top that I had in the freezer since it wasn't 4th of July and that was also good.

We did not find mascarpone so used strawberry whipped cream cheese instead. We also made it GF be creating a GF brownie for the base instead of the graham cracker. We were happy and loved the lemon, strawberry, chocolate flavor combination.

Overall great receipt. I cut the lime juice in half so there was only a hint of lemon which I felt it needed. Also increase vanilla in mixture.. I also added powder sugar to taste to sweeten the overall mixture which greatly enhanced the taste so that the cream cheese did not overpower the desert. All in all everyone loved the desert-big fight for the left overs!!

I love the ingenuity that went into the design of this no-bake cake recipe. These are some of my favorite fruits to incorporate into a cheesecake as well, am excited to make this for my friends around the fourth! I was reading around the internet for some fun 4th of July recipes to make, and happened to find this recipe in a blog that was inspired enough by this recipe to recreate it into a soap recipe which I found fun. http://www.naturesgardencandles.com/blog/2018/06/

I love this recipe. Made it twice now. The second time (July 4, 2017) I had to make a sub mascarpone cheese (cream cheese, whipping cream, sour cream) so I knew it would be a little less sweet. Score!!  The only other change was using raspberries. I will make this again and again.

First time  to make this. It was delicious! Used the marscapone. It is expensive vs cream cheese. Would definitely make again. Brought to a birthday party the week of the 4th. Can't say enough, was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Suggestion to wash, split your strawberries place on paper towel so they weep a little on towels, dry completely or you will have a weepy mess on top of your recipe. Also, did this about an hour before bringing to event.

It will be an easy annual 4th of July dessert for my family. Everyone loved it! I did add crushed pineapples to the cheese, based off of another person's review. I also did not use the lemon zests, only the lemon juice. Lastly it took me an hour to prepare, not the 30 minutes they suggested. But overall, very good recipe to try!

This was a big hit at my 4th of July cookout. I used Pillsbury refrigerated sugar cookie dough rolled out, then refrigerated for about 30 minutes so that it wouldn't spread too much while baking. I recommend refrigerating after rolling out so that it puffs up a bit more. Also helps with shaping into a square "flag." For the icing I mixed 8oz softened cream cheese with a tub of thawed whipped topping, and added Mexican Vanilla extract and Confectioners sugar to taste. It made a lot! I iced the cookie (after cooling it), then cut the cookie into individual pieces before putting the fruit on. Per another reviewer, I put my cut fruit on paper towels for a few hours beforehand. The cookie stayed firm for a bit, but did get soggy after maybe an hour outside - if you make this, I recommend keeping it inside so that doesn't happen. Very good recipe, but I recommend using the pre-made dough if you're in a time crunch like me!

Great no bake cheesecake.  The mascarpone cheese adds a subtle sweeter taste as well as being more of a whipped texture.  Changed it to Canadian flag cake.  Used only strawberries.  Got lots of compliments on Canada Day theme.

I had hoped it would not be well liked so I could take a lot home. I had to settle for a small corner of the pan I put it in. Darn! I did not use the cocoa, or make a flag. I also used more sugar. Otherwise the recipe was followed.

Nice tasty dish... but prep time for me was a full hour. I'm not slow at cooking (not the fastest either).

This cheesecake had a great taste. It was soooo good. It was also very impressive to the guests at my party... little did they know how easy it was to make! The one thing I will say is that it did not set up well and it was more like pudding than cheesecake. I am not sure if that is because I didn't get the whipping cream quite right or what but it was very runny.

This is absolutely divine.  The lemon juice, lemon zest, mascarpone and handmade  whipped cream folded in makes this amazing.  Highly suggest using the whisk attachment to an electric hand mixer when making the whipped cream and blending it with the cheese and lemon.  I made this 100% diet friendly using coconut flour, Splenda and unsweetened cocoa powder for the crust, and Splenda instead of sugar for the filling.  I did increase the Splenda about 1/2 a cup which helped the sweetness a bit.  I did not use the fruit this time round because the filling tasted so good I wanted to enjoy it.  My guests also loved this and couldn't believe it was low carb, sugar free.

Made it for 4th of July!  Huge hit and beautiful!  Lite due to the mascarpone mousse-like filling and so great with fresh berries.  Made it exactly according to recipe.  Chilled overnight before topping with berries the morning of the 4th.  Turned out perfect.

Update:  I made it again for Labor Day weekend...this time I added a tiny bit of confectioner's (powdered) sugar to the cream cheese mixture...I didn't measure so maybe a tablespoon...I think it gave the filling a little sweetness without at all overpowering the lemon or the berries.  Huge hit and beautiful!  

Definitely, definitely do this in steps if you can...first I chilled the choc graham cracker crust overnight (2 nights before) then I added the mascarpone/cream cheese mix and chilled again for another overnight.  Topped with the berries the morning of.  Fantastic!

This is one of the best and easy cheesecakes I have ever made!  I did make a few minor changes.  First I am not a big lemon fan so we used 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 almond extract.  I used a mascarpone substitute which was easy and made the cake delicious!  Will be making it again very soon at a birthday party.

This was delicious. The only change I made was to use regular graham cracker crumbs, not chocolate. It was a huge hit at our 4th gathering.  I let the cut strawberries sit on paper towels for a few minutes and there was no bleeding.
Definitely will make again.

Granted...I changed it up a bit, but it was DELISH!! I added more lemons and zest, more cream cheese, more vanilla. I made my crust gluten-free, using Pamela's Products Cinnamon Mini Graham crackers, didn't add as much sugar to the crust because of that, but still added the cocoa and baked the crust for about 10 minutes, let it cool, then add the filling. I will definitely make this again with different fruit toppings. Thank you, Chef John!

Excellent! Very delicious!  We had it for 4th of July! My family loved it!  It will be a new tradition for 4th of July!
  I accidentally bought cinnamon graham crackers, but it turned out great! I only used two packages of cream cheese, not the other cheese.  I put a little more lemon juice and  grated lemon and the flavor was light, yet sweet and rich with the lemon cream cheese flavor.  Mine was very sweet. I read some people commenting on it not being sweet enough, maybe due to the other cheese I didn't use? My husband really liked the crust.  I think  the cinnamon graham crackers gave it a kick, without an obvious cinnamon taste. The flavor blended well.

It certainly looked like the flag.  It tasted good if you like a super light whipped creamy  type of cake.  The only thing I did different was I used Bischoff cookies for the crust as I prefer them to graham crackers.  I did add the cocoa and really liked that.  I did not add the sugar because Bischoff are a sweet cookie.

No changes but not what I expected.  I love the flavor and it was beautiful to look at.  I was hoping that it would have a firmer body.  I seek the ultimate NY style cheese cake and haven't found it yet.

I added chopped nuts to the crust, but it was the cocoa that I think needed sugar. It looked so pretty, but it didn't taste as good as it looked. The marscapone and cream cheese probably needed some sugar, which I had doubts about but thought once I added the whip cream that had the sugar, it might be good. The consistency was good; easy to cut and serve, but the taste was missing. I won't make it again. Disappointed because I usually have good luck with Allrecipes. Thanks for listening.

Best cake ever - my boys helped me put the fruit on and it was devoured at the cookout.  Best part - no oven/heat involved.  I too couldn't find marscapone at the store so just doubled the cream cheese.  Next time I'll probably use chocolate graham crackers vs adding cocoa to the regular graham crackers - but just b/c it's a time saver.  This cake was perfect.

I made this cake for our church coffee hour.  I was hoping to take a piece or two home, but the cake was devoured, and I got lots of compliments on it.  (I did get a very small taste of it)  I did use an electric mixer to make the whipped cream because of arthritis in my hands, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Will make again.

Great recipe! I did add about 2 Tblsp of powdered sugar to the cream cheese mixture as I like my cheesecake sweet. Turned out to be just the right amount. Lemons add a great flavor. Very easy to put together! Love it!

Made this cheesecake today for the 4th of July. So delicious. I made exactly like the recipe calls and it turned out perfect! My family loved it! I wouldn't change a thing.

I omitted the lemon zest, just because I didn't want it to be too strong, and it turned out GREAT anyway. Very nice subtle lemon flavor with the fresh lemon juice. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and am very happy with the results! Light and fluffy treat, perfect for a Fourth of July party!

It was pretty, but disappointing. NOT a 15 min. prep.  Very little taste.  Not a good hot weather dessert--serves up like pudding with everything mixed in.  Strictly a cold weather, indoor dessert. Won't again.

I followed the recipe exactly other than using a 9x13 pan (I didn't even know there were 9x11 pans?) for a 4th of July party.  Everyone who tried it liked it a lot.  I loved the crust and the texture of the filling.  I may cut back on the lemon juice and lemon zest to a tsp each next time as it did have a fairly strong lemon taste to it.

Didn't make any real changes to the original recipe, other than doubling the filling recipe to fill a 13x9  cake pan. Big family to feed at Fourth of July party. It was a huge hit both appearance and taste. I will make this a regular addition to family events.

This cheesecake was tasty and popular with the guests at my bbq but I was very disappointed in the way is cut. The pieces were somewhat messy and did not hold together when I lifted them out ot the pan so I probably will not make this again.

I followed the instructions exactly.  The cream is delicious and the strawberry and blue berry decorations are beautiful!  This was relatively easy to make, although I am not fond of 2 bowl/2 step procedures (i.e. when making the whipped cream and folding it into the cream cheese-mascarpone mixture).  I think it will be a hit for both taste and aesthetics.

I am making this for the 4th. We will be traveling for about 3-4 hours before it's served. Can I freeze the entire cake and then put in cooler until serving?

It's perfect as is. Chef John always delivers. I did sub out some of the sugar with truvia, but for health reasons, not to improve this recipe. 2 Tbsp of Truvia worked for us in place of the last 1/3c of sugar. Thanks Chef John!

Probably won't make this again.  I thought the "cheesecake part " of it didn't firm up enough and even though I used non fat cream cheese and regular cream cheese (instead of the Italian cream cheese) I still felt it was too rich for my taste.  Otherwise the video was very good and easy to follow

Chef John nails it yet again!!  We all thought it was delicious and not too sweet.  I might  suggest washing & drying strawberries thoroughly first and placing them on the cake closer to serving time...for those who have trouble with "bleeding" strawberries!

I had to use 2 packages of cream cheese;  I couldn't find any mascarpone cheese at the stores I tried.  I also added an extra 1/3 cup sugar, based on other reviews.  Everyone at the party LOVED it and several people asked for the recipe.  I will be making this again and again.

This was pretty good. The cream cheese / marscapone / whipped filling was to die for, and the lemon addition was delectable. The strawberries married well with these flavours. However, the chocolate graham cracker crust was a confusing element to this dish. I think, if I prepare this again, I will omit the cocoa powder and substitute a vanilla Based cracker / cookie for the graham crackers.
