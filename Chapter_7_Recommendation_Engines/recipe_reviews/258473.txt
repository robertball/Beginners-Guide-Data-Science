3.5.18 These are not only tasty but have lovely presentation with very little effort. I used honey vanilla goat cheese which mellowed out the sharpness just a bit in the cheese and combined with the walnuts rosemary and honey this is an awesome appetizer! Always looking for finger food for both casual and more formal get-togethers and this is one that is elegant enough for a nice dinner party. I can see these crostini being served with a glass of champagne if you want to get that fancy. Thanks for sharing your recipe Cookin_in_Wheaton it s going into my Favorites folder.
