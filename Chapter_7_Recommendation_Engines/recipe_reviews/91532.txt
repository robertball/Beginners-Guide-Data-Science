ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! i made some alterations in an attempt to make it healthier. I used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup of splenda brown sugar. i also only used 1/2 cup of honey. i used half applesauce and half olive oil. i also used whole wheat flour and i didnt have allspice so i added nutmeg instead. I also chopped the apples up instead of shreaded them. I will DEFINATLY make this again!

Quite good! We cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and the honey to 1/2 cup. Substituted 1/2 vanilla rice milk for 1/2 the oil. Also, had no nuts. Easy to make. Shared with the neighbors, who also liked it. Plenty sweet with less suagar and honey. We will definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious!  It was very sweet, but I like it sweet.  I made it fat free by substituting pumpkin for all of the fat,which produced an extremely moist cake.  I'll definitely make again!

This was a great cake.  I actually made 2...1st was exactly as written and 2nd I made the following changes:  used 2/3 c white sugar + 3 tbs Splenda, 1/2 c canola oil + 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce, 1 egg + 1/4 c egg substitute, 1/2 c honey, 1 1/2 c all-purpose flour + 1 c whole wheat flour, added 1/4 tsp ground cloves, I chopped instead of shred the apples and used white sugar instead of flour on the baking pan.  It smelled so good coming out of the oven we dug in as soon as I flipped the cake out of the pan.  I loved that the only chopping was for the apples.  We only ate the doctored cake so far (the other is for my office) but it was so good with all the changes I can only imagine that the full effect one is even better.  So quick and easy, my 2 1/2 yo dd helped and had a great time.  I can tell I'll be making this a lot.

An excellent cake for Rosh Hashanah.  I followed the recipe pretty closely with a couple of small changes: I sub'd 1/3 cup of the oil with apple sauce and increased the amount of apples to 4, and I upped the spices, adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cardamon, 1/2 tsp of ginger & 1/8 tsp cloves.  The cake turned out wonderfully!  Very moist and quite delicious, and hubby even said it was the best honey cake he had ever had (I blush!)

This cake was a hit!  I took it to a church fellowship and it was gone in less than 5 minutes! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. I may add a full cup of nuts next time, but only because I REALLY like nuts. Good flavor but not too sweet and really moist. I will definately be making this again!!

This is a great recipe. I didn't have allspice so I substituted 1/2 tbsp nutmeg..it was delicious. I used 2 red delicious apples and one granny smith. I used my hand grater and used the largest part of the shredder. I noticed that the granny smith stays white and produces more juice, while the red turned browm, even after sprinkling w a little lemon juice..really makes no difference, looks the same when done. I also made this a second time with 1/2 c chopped walnuts. the cake came out bigger..I am not that fond of nuts, but the people that were loved it. I think it is moister without the nuts!

Delicious! Easy to make as well. Moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe, only adding some nutmeg because  I love the spice with apples. I made a simple dessert sauce to go along with it: 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla in a saucepan. Bring to boil for 3 minutes and serve warm.

I made this for Rosh Hashanah and the fam LOVED it!  I made a few changes: 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, reduced to 1/2 cup honey, used 1.5 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  I used 3 Cortland apples (in season here in CT in late Sept.) and topped it off with a honey, powdered sugar, pumpkin pie spice glaze!  So yummy!!!!!

Wonderful!!  I used Cameo apples that weren't as crisp as we like for eating fresh. I used only 1/2 cup oil + 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup of oil.  

Cake was moist and delicious!  The whole family loved it. Thanks!!

I baked 2 smaller bundts at about 45 mins each.  I too backed off on the honey to 1/2 cup, glad I did, it's rather sweet.  It's not as moist as I would've anticipated with the honey.  All that maybe because it was baked smaller, I will try another time in a large bundt and see. I am going to make some caramel sauce this evening and drizzled it over a warmed up slice of cake for dessert.

On further thinking about this cake...I think a warm caramel glaze poured over it while the cake is still warm (therefore they cool together) would be what I do the next time I make it.

I love honey cake, I love apple cake, so I thought I would give this a try. This was good, but VERY sweet(and I have a sweet tooth). The cake was very moist, but it was hard to taste the apples through all the honey and sugar. I tried to save it by topping with a cream cheese glaze which was tangy, to off set the sweetness of the cake. My apples were quite tart, but I would make sure you use really tart apples if you attempt this recipe as is. This recipe has a lot of potential, but it needs some work. I used way more cinnamon, several teaspoons, and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the allspice. I'll probably up them even more next time. I used 4 small pink lady apples, because there was no real measurement in the recipe(big apples, small apples, wasn't sure). Next time I'll grate half the apples, and chop the other half for some texture(personal preference). And of course, I'll cut WAY down on the sugar! I'll probably use 1/4 cup, to let the honey and apple flavors shine through. It really doesn't need any sugar, the honey and apples make it sweet enough, but I'm not sure I can just leave out all sugar without having texture/structure issues.  Some apple cakes tend to be dry, but this was super moist. I always made apple cake with chopped apples, never thought of grating them, that and the honey, I think, was what made it so moist. I'll definitely give this another try. Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

Phenomenal. This cake was gone almost as soon as I made it. I took other's advice and added less sugar (makes a huge difference!), a little less oil, and a bit of applesauce. The applesauce made it taste better and more moist! Yum!

I needed something to serve for dessert with friends, one of whom is unable to have milk or soy.  This cake not only did the trick, but it turned out fabulous.  I used Pink Lady and Royal Gala apples for a blend that turned out to be perfect; the only thing I left out was the nuts.  It's a beautiful moist cake, perfect for desserts or for coffee.

This was excellent, way better than most honey cakes, which tend to be dry. I cut sugar by 1/4 cup, and we really liked the level of sweetness.

I used granny smith apples and followed the recipe exactly but I didn't put any nuts in.  It was AMAZING to say the least.  I took it to a family Rosh Hashanah dinner and they kept sneaking back to eat more of it.  Did I say it was AMAZING?  Try it!!!  It's really good and easy to make as well.  Thanks you Jayda!!!

This came out delicious! I made it for Rosh Hashana- when we traditionally eat apples and honey. I used can pumpkin instead of oil- lending the cake a wonderfully moist texture as well as a delicious taste and smell. I just chopped the apples instead of shredding them- I personally enjoy chunks of fruit in cake.

This recipe was really easy and though the cake seemed heavy when I picked it up, it's really moist and yummy. I was worried it would be too sweet based off of other reviews, but I ended up being 1/4 cup of honey shy, creating the perfect balance of sugar and spice. I also subbed in apple sauce for some of the oil, which I think added to the nice apple flavor of the cake.

WONDERFUL! Receiver rave reviews, changed a few things, did not shred apple, only chopped it, was to lazy to get out the food processor for 3 apples! and used applesauce instead of oil. I made ahead of time and refrigerated for Rosh Hoshanah, it was still moist and flavorful! Enjoy!

I have been using this recipe to make apple bread for a few years and my kids love it! When I have an apple that no one seems to want to eat, I throw it in the freezer and save them to make this recipe. If it's a frozen apple, I don't even peel it. I like to make it in mini loaf pans and freeze for school lunches or bites after dinner.

Tastes delicious, BUT be sure to REALLY grease up the pan with olive oil or butter, then flour, AND let it cool for at least 30 minutes, not 10. I followed directions to the  T, but my bundt cake just fell apart when I lifted it. It still tastes great, but I must have  tried to lift up the pan too soon and it was not greased enough =[

Made this cake almost exactly as written. Substituted nutmeg for the allspice, and then left out the nuts, and only used two apples. Cake came out AMAZING. Got lots of compliments, especially great with a honey cinnamon glaze!

This recipe is a great fit for Rosh Hashana because it is a honey cake with more nutrition and better yet, more flavor! I served this for dessert on Rosh Hashana and everyone loved it. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and left out the allspice (don't have). Also tossed in some dried cranberries. Yum! Caution: check your oven while cooking. Mine, done in a bundt pan as pictured, was baked to perfection in just 45 minutes.

Great cake!  This has just become my new standard honey cake recipe for Rosh Hashanah.  Good with and without the nuts.

I made it with 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup cinnamon applesauce. I also made a brown sugar glaze (1/2 c brown sugar, 1 t vanilla and 2 T water) to put on top when it was done. It was good!

This cake is so yummy served warm with ice cream. I used Granny Smith apples and because I live at high altitude I added 2 more tablespoons of flour. I baked it in two loaf pans and they turned out great. I had to bake it about 5-7 minutes longer than was suggested. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I've made this five or six times now. This time i had a small zucchini that was looking a little witheted so I grated it in with the apples. I also toss the grated apples with a tablespoon or two of sifted flour and a couple Tbs. of cinnamon and sugar before adding to the batter.  I also usually drizzle the warm cake with a concoction of warmed honey a little brown sugar, a tsp of butter and after simmering for a minute add a little heavy cream to make a simple glaze that soaks into the warm cake and is delicious. A little apple juice or cider added to the  glaze is good too.

Everyone noted it was very sweet so I eased up on the sugar a bit and same of the honey. Just about 1/4 c less of each. I tossed in some golden raisins. Mind you, after cutting back on the sugar, I made a caramel glaze and smothered it in that with some chopped nuts on top. It was consumed in record time at the office so I can't complain. I thought it was quite tasty myself.

Lovely moist cake that is so easy to make. The hardest part of the recipe is peeling and cutting the apple (I don't have a grater; renting a temporary furnished apartment). This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing it.

I baked this into 2 loaves since I wanted to share.  I chose to chop the apples in to rough chop of about 1/4 inch size pieces instead of shredding. I didn't have a box shredder on hand and don't own a food processor. It took about 55 minutes at 325 for these to finish, but I did check at 45 minutes and 50 minutes in, maybe it depends on the apples? When the loaves came out of the oven I drizzled about a tablespoon of honey onto each loaf and then sprinkled with powdered sugar. This cake came out nice and moist and not too sweet.

Yummy! I cut the sugar down to 1/3 c and honey down to 1/2 c, still it was plenty sweet. I also reduced the foulr to 2 cups and added 1/2 quick oats, that added a bit of extra hardiness. I didn't bother shredding the apples, just chopped them small. I served it drizzled with the "Warm Vanilla Butter Sauce" recipe.

This is fantastic!  I tried to up the healthy factor.. used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white, cut the sugar in half (1/2 cup), used 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, used 5 apples instead of 3.  I also sauteed some chopped apple in a little butter to garnish the cake.  It was moist and delicious, my guests devoured it.

Made this for my first Rosh Hashannah, wanted something that mixed apples and honey. My family loved it, it was moist, sweet, delicious and very aromatic. I made a sugar glaze (confectioners sugar and water) to finish it.

Excellent.  I also made a few changes as other reviewers had suggested.  I used 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. splenda,  1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and left out the walnuts (allergy).  It was soooo moist and delicious.

This would be 10,000 stars, but they wouldn't let us! We used some brown sugar and white sugar instead of just white, only used 2 apples instead of 3, and avoided allspice and nuts. You can just cook it for about 50 mins, and the cake of awesomeness is right out of your oven and perfect!

I made this for Rosh Hashanah. It was very popular especially with my husband. No more of the old honey spice cakes!  I made it without nuts to accommodate some nut free folks, and drizzled it with a caramel glaze. It looks pretty when baked in a bundt pan if being served as the solo dessert, but if it's to be served along with other desserts buffet style, I think it would be better to bake in a loaf pan for easier cutting and smaller size portions.

Super easy and the whole office loved it.  I followed recipe exactly except I did use a whole cup of the chopped nuts- only because I had two 1/2c bags.  It was fine.  Very moist.  No one felt it was too sweet but is rich in flavor.  Took a little longer for mine to bake- more like 65/70 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

I am not a baker, so I am not sure what I did wrong, but this batter killed my hand mixer! I used some unsweetened applesauce in place of some oil, and I used Splenda, and the batter was so thick it froze my beater. I did actually finish mixing it by hand, and did bake it....for over 2 hours!!!! It tasted fine, a little like it wasn't quit finished, but ok. I am thinking it was the flour, but i put it all in a glass jar and do not remember what type of flour it was. I will add a photo soon.

This is by far one of the easiest and more flavorful cakes I have ever made!!!! I got total rave reviews when I made this! It is sweet, but good sweet and I did make a maple glaze to make it look pretty and even sweeter. I made it a second time and ran out of honey and used cinnamon applesauce...and I have to say, it was not as moist. It was a lot lighter and airy....but still good. I give it an A++...A total keeper!!!!!

I cooked the cake for 65 minutes, and it was still way underdone.  A thick layer stuck to the pan, and the inside of the cake was sort of gummy.  It was still good, but needed to be cooked much longer at a lower temp.  The outside was browned. Still tasted good, but I may cook it some more tomorrow.

Wow, this cake was awesome. I made it to take to my MIL last night for the Jewish New Year and it was a hit. I added an orange glaze to the top and sub. applesauce for the oil. Thank you for a yummy desert.

This tasted pretty good, but I think it would make a better muffin than a cake. I'll try that next time.

Really good cake.  Easy to make and delicious.  I substituted 1/4 c. of the oil for applesauce.  I probably could have cut the sugar down a little bit, too.  Next time I will try a little less sugar and add a bit of fresh nutmeg.

This was a very good budnt cake. I made it twice already because my mother requested it. I originally made it for her Ham and Bean dinner for the senoir citizens and they all raved about it at the dinner table. When I gave the last piece away to one of the elders my mother was ask me to make another cake.

Thank you so much for sharing.

I forgot the vanilla, but it still came out ok. Might try it again to see if the vanilla makes that much of a difference.

I made this for Yom Kippur Break Fast and it was pretty good.  Dense, as is typical with honey cakes - but very good flavor.  For me, it was missing something....I think I'll add 1/4t of ground cloves next time around.  I made a few changes....for the sugar I did 1/3c Splenda, 2/3c sugar.  For the oil I did 1/2c oil, 1/2c unsweetened applesauce.  Next time I'll also change the flour and do 1 1/2c white and 1c whole wheat (I LOVE whole wheat flour with apples and honey!!).  Thanks for sharing!

Very happy with the results! wonderful for Rosh Hashanah! I did make some changes. I used Namaste gluten free flour blend. I used five apples, coarsely chopped, and I left out the nuts completely. I also borrowed the following suggestions from Clare's comment.  I substituted 1/3 of the oil with applesauce, and used 1/2 tsp each of cardamom, nutmeg, and ginger, and 1/4 tsp cloves instead of allspice. I drizzled on warm honey while the cake was still warm, then kept it in a cake carrier until it was time to serve, about two hours later. It was delightfully sweet and moist, with great texture. It was a big hit, and I will definitely make it again... next week, in fact for Yom Kippur break fast!

I made this exactly by the recipe, and it was delicious.  I baked it in a Bundt pan for 60 minutes, and after the suggested cooling time it slid right out.

Followed the recipe to the t. It came out perfect. The cake is very moist but make sure you don't bake it too long otherwise it will be dry. It has sophisticated flavors the allspice and cinnamon taste it is  a great cake for winter time!  Make it you won't regret it.

Needed an apple cake to take along to Rosh Hashanah and this fit the bill nicely. (A side note:  I used Buckwheat honey which made this cake super dark, but I thought delicious. However I got mixed reactions from my family). The second and third time I made it I  lessened the amount of sugar by a quarter cup. Halved the amount of oil and subbed in baby food applesauce. Replaced the cinnamon and allspice with Penzey's Cake spice (because I had it on hand). Added an additional apple and shredded half, then diced the other half for an added textural element; drizzled the apples with orange juice to keep them from browning. I did skip the nuts each time I made it because my family for some odd reason doesn't like them in baked goods. Thank you Jayda for sharing this recipe!

it was very tasty.  however the honey flavor was intense (and we are a family who loves our honey.  real honey.   and the amount of sugar was insane.  made it for a church fellowship and people raved about it.  next time i will try substituting the entire cup of sugar for something else (splenda does not count) and maybe butter for the oil.  but this recipe as is?  great :)

This is my first attempt at this recipe.
Didn't have all spice, so I used an extra 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon.
Also, had to bake for the full 65 minutes plus an additional 10 minutes.
Keeping fingers AND toes crossed...only tasted the batter and it was delicious! 
Couldn't wait for it to cool and turn out but I'm positive it'll be just as expected...YUMMY IN OUR TUMMIES!

I made this last night for supper as my husband loves honey and is constantly asking me to make him a "honey cake".  We liked it, the apples, spices and walnuts were nice and the honey made it really moist.  I will make it again, but will cut the sugar next time.  To me it seemed a good bit too sweet; otherwise very good.

I've baked this cake several times already -- each time it won RAVE reviews. (It's also a great Pareve dessert if you're serving meat for dinner and want to "keep it kosher" haha) ... very moist and rich, a great fall recipe! Also much easier to make than it seems, which is great because it never lasts long around my house!

I would love to give this recipe a higher review, but I just couldn't yet. When I made the batter, it looked great and tasted great. But after baking it for over 65 minutes (I had been testing it for doneness, and the toothpick came out clean), after we cut into it, I realized that the entire center was underbaked. I'm not sure how I couldn't have spotted this, given that the toothpick came out perfectly clean and I baked it for more than enough time. Now, granted I baked it in my beehive cake pan. But still, I'm not sure what happened. (By the way, the cake that was done was VERY dense and moist. I substituted applesauce for the oil, and I think that's part of the reason.)

Very nice cake.  At least, that's what my coworkers told me.  I'm now realizing I didn't try it at all--I brought it in for a coworkers birthday and had to leave almost immediately after we sang to her, so I didn't eat any that day or the next.  However, everyone told me it was very good.  Moist, sweet, and delicious, so I'll go with their comments to rate it.  I didn't have to bake any longer than directed.  I did, however, cut the sugar by about a 1/4 and left the rest alone.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing cake.  I baked it for Rosh Hashanah at my parent's house and it was a hit.  I diced the apples instead of shredding and it turned out wonderfully.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made as directed (minus nuts) and thought it was excellent.  I felt there was no need for any type of icing or sugar as it would only "gild the lily."  Received rave reviews from all who ate it!  Definite keeper!

Make no mistake - this is not a diet friendly recipe, but it was yummy. I made this for Rosh Hashana. I substituted pecans for walnuts which I think was a good choice. After it was all done, I drizzled a thin layer of honey on top and sprinkled powder sugar to make it look pretty.

Left the cake in the oven for 55 minutes and let cool. When I flipped the cake out of the bundt pan, half of the cake was not done. Had to put back in the oven for another 30 minutes. Not sure what happened but that ended up drying out the cake.

I am not a baker - at all - but I made this last night, and got raves.  It was easy and really delicious.  As suggested by others, I subsituted some splenda for sugar, and applesauce for some oil.  I can't imagine it would taste any better if it had the fatty/higher calorie stuff in it.  I am now eating it with my coffee for breakfast....YUM.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, using Granny Smith apples and this cake is fabulous.  It comes out really moist and flavorful.  Baking time for me was 60 minutes.  I baked it in a fleur de lis bundt pan (wedding present), which created nice detail on the sides, then sifted powdered sugar over the top.  I was considering caramel sauce, but this cake really doesn't need any extras-- it's delicious as is.  I'll be making this more often, definitely.  Thanks for the recipe!

VERY GOOD cake.  The only changes I made to this cake was I only used 1/2 cup of honey instead of 3/4. I also shook some confec. sugar & cinn. on top & drizzled some caramel syrup over it all.  Very moist & flavorful.  Will make again SOON!

Excellent cake!  I made this for our Rosh Hashanah dinner and everyone loved it.  Easy to make, very moist and no need for any glaze.  Makes a great snacking cake.

I just made this cake and within minutes of cooking the entire house smelled amazing.  It wasn't out of the oven ten minutes before half of it was gone.  I'm making another one tomorrow!  It is simply delicious.  It was easy to make and on a personal note...I threw in some extra nuts because we all just love nutty things!

Made this cake for Christmas morning; it traveled well from Maine to Mass. and was just as moist and tasty the next day.  Easy, too, with no exotic ingredients!  Will make this cake frequently.  Delicious!

Very nice texture and moist.  Has a nice flavor, taste better the next day. Cake came out of its pan very easy.  It did take longer to cook than said, but ovens vary in temperature.  To make it more nutritious try whole wheat pastry. flour.

Subbed 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cardamom, 1/8 tsp ginger for allspice.  Squeezed excess juice out of the grated apples with cheesecloth  before adding.

I made it exactly as is (except I don’t have allspice so I subbed 1/2 tsp of nutmeg). I agree, a bit too sweet for my taste and woah! A whole cup of oil... Next time I make this, I will definitely cut the oil with applesauce.

This came out great.  I substituted nutmeg for allspice and cut the oil to half a cup and added half a cup of applesauce. I used 4 small  chopped apples. Finally, I used an applesauce frosting.

With no milk and no butter on hand, but wanting to make a special treat for our anniversary, I turned to this recipe and was not disappointed! This was sooo good and sooo moist! I ended up halving the recipe and turned it into cupcakes instead of a bundt cake. They baked for about 26 minutes and were amazing!

Only change was pecans instead of walnuts as that's what I had on hand. Used two loaf pans. Will definitely !! make again.

Passed along recipe to sis and her family enjoyed it without the nuts  (the do not like foods w/ nuts).

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half, using two apples.  I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, and omitted the nuts.  I wanted a ginger flavor, so I added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger and four large slices of candied ginger, diced.  I threw in a little cardamom, and left out any other spices.  Very rich, but a wonderful treat.

Delicious and so moist! I halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan and it received rave reviews from the family. I left out the nuts due to an allergy and it's great even without them.

I made it as written and after 50 minutes of baking it was dry and burnt on the outside. Could not appreciate the honey flavor at all.  The majority of the positive reviews drastically changed the recipe.

Glad I went thru the reviews, cut the sugar and honey by a quarter cup each.    Didn't have allspice, so used 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  Also used chopped pecans as didn't have any walnuts.  Cooked in an hour and came out of pan after 15 minutes.   Moist and really delicious,  will be making again.  Thank for such a yummy recipe

Outside was crisp but inside a bit too moist (like undercooked even tho outside was really brown). Next time, will cut down on oil.

Really good. Made some alterations. Subbed 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 cup of the 1 cup of oil. Also only used 1/2 cup honey, and added 1/4 cup milk. Used only 2 cups flour.  Also omitted the apples since I used applesauce and nuts. Came out really, really yummy. Great paired with vanilla ice cream!

Easy to make and very moist and flavourful.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I didn't include Allspice and added a bit of nutmeg.  I decorated with candy pumpkins and orange icing on the top and it looked festive for the fall.

Everyone raved about how good this cake was.  I did not have a bundt pan, so I used two smaller pans and reduced the cook time.

Per other reviews, I used 2/3 c sugar, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup unsweeten applesauce, 1/2 cup honey, 2 chopped apples (green and gala) -used less since the chunks were big.  Also I used 2 c flour and 1/2 cup oatmeal.  I baked as muffins.  Finally, I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top prior to baking.  So GOOD. Baked about 20 min.

this was delish! super moist and doesn't need icing or ice cream. I modified a few small things which probably made it less sweet than the original.  about 1/3 cup of honey rather than 3/4. Also traded the walnuts for Pecans and added the guts of a real vanilla bean to the vanilla extract for extra flavor.  Came out wonderful!

I made it for RH - nice and moist, not an overwhelming flavor - honestly I think it could use more cinnamon.  I subbed applesauce for the oil and grated half of the apples and minced the rest - i like the chunks.  I had to bake it 65 minutes.    I left out the nuts because I'm allergic -  maybe use raisins or craisins to replace them?  overall a nice cake.

I was looking for an apple honey cake to bring for Rosh Hashanah. I used two, nine-inch round pans instead of the bundt pan and substituted the vegetable oil with half homemade applesauce and half olive oil. I decreased the honey to a 1/2 cup. The cake is very moist and was sweet enough even without the glaze. I added Paula Dean's Honey Glaze (1 cup confectioners sugar, 2TBLS milk, 2TBLS honey).

I've had a go to apple cake recipe for over 20 years.  This recipe replaced that.  This is a very moist, tasty cake.  Yes, I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and the oil to 2/3 cup.  I figured with the apples I could do that and it did not take away from the moistness of the cake at all.  I enjoyed that it mixed up easily without getting my stand mixer out.  I used pecans once and then the walnuts.  The flavor has a bit of a caramel hint.  This is a keeper.  I served it at a morning coffee get together and did dollop a bit of sweetened whipped cream.  This is a keeper.

Yum! Now I have a great apple cake recipe. The honey just adds that extra touch that makes this cake super. And if you want an extra treat, have it for dessert slightly warmed with a scoop or two of ice cream. To die for :)

This cake came out amazing. I lowered the honey to 2/3 cup. Also used local raw honey.  Upped the all spice to a tsp. Increased the walnuts to a cup. I coated the pan with cooking spray then dusted with cinnamon sugar. It stuck in some spots. Next time I will try the cooking spray with flour and see if that works better.

Love it!! Used half cup honey, half cup oil, and finished filling the cup with unsweetened applesauce. Used half cup sugar, not white, used Demerara brown sugar! Great recipe!

It was really sweet and I did cut down on the honey, not only because I thought is was a lot of sugar, but also because honey is pretty expensive.  I have been having issues with cakes that have fruits in them, they don't seem to be rising much, sometimes.  Anyone have any clues as to what I might be able to adjust?  Thanks!

Soo good....I always lower the sugar content in my recipes. Especially when there is a sweet fruit involved.....and honey. Served it with cream cheese frosting on the side...its favorite!

Delicious! Moist, tasty and will definitely make again! 

Some slight additions: I added a bit of orange juice, some candied ginger, lemon/orange zest and a titch of cardamon.

I made two modifications and, apart from those, followed the recipe exactly: Instead of one cup of oil, I used half cup oil and half cup unsweetened applesauce. And instead of allspice, I used cardamom. (I just love cardamom and thought it would be a little different than the usual cinnamon and allspice combination.) It was fantastic. Moist, tasty, delicious. I think next time I will just use a little bit less sugar.

I bake sometimes for the clients of our hair salon and this cake is so delicious that woman don't remember to think about calories and everything:) I added the foxberries I picked in the woods this weekend and used freshly stolen apples from "no one's" garden :) Thank you for this recipe!!!

This is good. Great texture. Great flavor. We are bee keepers and love to incorporate honey where we can.

Delicious! I took the advise of other reviewers and cut the honey to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I used dark brown sugar because that's what I had on hand.  I also chopped the apples into small pieces instead of shredding.  Perfect!  I will be making this again! Thanks JAYDA for the great recipe! :)

Just made this using whole wheat flour instead of white, substituted 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce, used only 1/2 cup of sugar and  1/2 cup of honey.  I put about 1/4 of a cup of vanilla glaze on while it was still warm.  Even with these healthy changes it was still very moist and delicious!  I will be making this again.

Loved this bundt cake!  The only changes I made was I cut the oil in half, only added 1/2 cup honey and added 1 additional apple.  It was exceptionally moist and delicious!

I've made this cake almost exactly as per recipe only substituting all purpose flour, baking powder and soda with the same total amount of self-raising flour. The cake was moist and absolutely delicious, and had a huge success. I used two loaf pans, but baking time was about 1 hr total, the same as for the Bundt pan, different ovens bake differently maybe. Thank you!

Delicious! I made a few changes though: I used butter instead of vegetable oil and brown sugar instead of white sugar. So good! Will definitely make it again.

A very moist bundt cake...I used half a cup of applesauce to replace some of the oil, reduced the honey to half a cup and left out the nuts.  Good, but I like the "Apple Bundt Cake" recipe on this website better.

LOVED this cake, and I'm not a cake person!  I used 1/2 of Splenda sugar blend in place of the sugar, so I ended up with a shorter, denser cake and cut the honey back to 1/2 cup.  I also cut the oil in half and subbed apple sauce.  It was plenty sweet enough and a huge hit at home and work.  Will make again.  And again.

This is a delicious cake.  I made it mostly according to the recipe.  I only substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c oil.  I think I will cut back on the cinnamon next time.  I think it tasted better on day 2.  Will make again.  Thanks for this recipe.

Good cake. I made it pretty much as is- just added a bit more of the spices because I like things spicy! Didn't find it too sweet at all as other reviewers suggested. I dusted it with icing sugar, cinnamon and cardamom.

Tasty! Served this to the in-laws and it was a big hit. I topped this cake with a simple glaze of confectioners sugar and a touch of milk. Also tasty served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again and again!
