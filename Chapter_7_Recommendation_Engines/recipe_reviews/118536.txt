Very good!  I added fresh basil and extra chicken.  Also added a can of chopped tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  I should have topped with parmesan or mozzarella cheese. I will next time.

Oh my, I used left over chicken cacciatore in which I used a whole chicken, so I took the left overs, carcass and all and threw it in the crock pot....reserving the sauce....to make my own stock.  Then I added the sauce, which included green beans (i exclude peppers from chix cacc.) and mushrooms, and the rice....YUMMY!!  Thank you Wendy, now I can make good use of my left over chix cacciatore!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I thought it was a little bland, so I added garlic and onion powder.  I also served it with some shredded mozerrella and italian blend cheese on top and a piece of garlic bread on the side.

This was an excellent base, but when I first made it I thought it needed something more.  I sauteed one diced onion in olive oil for approximately 5 minutes.  To this I added the uncooked cubed chicken (2 breast halves) and 2 minced garlic cloves, stirring to sear the chicken.  To the chicken mixture I added 4 cups of chicken broth, a 32-ounce jar of quality tomato-basil pasta sauce, a quartered and sliced zucchini, the parsley and thyme.  Upon boiling, I reduced the heat and simmered, uncovered for 10 minutes then added approximately 2 cups of a rice side dish that was left-over from a previous meal.  This was simmered until heated through.  I topped each bowl with freshly grated Parmesan cheese prior to serving.  My husband proclaimed it a definite keeper!  Thank you for submitting this!

It was easy to make. I added sausage and mushrooms to the soup to make it more filling. I like the recipe and i will make it again sometime.

Yum!  and so simple.  I used homemade sauce, tossed in some small shell pasta instead of the rice, and used a can of turkey breast (undrained) for the chicken.  Topped with mozzarella and served with some bread-machine french bread.

What a great way to reinvent pork cacciatore leftovers (I obviously used pork instead of chicken). I didn't have any fresh parsley so I subbed fresh basil from the garden and it really added great flavor. I recommend it if you have any. I waited until the end to add brown rice and freshly grated asiago because I didn't want the leftovers to have mushy rice. I will make this again next time I have leftover cacciatore with the addition of beans.

This was good.  I used gnocchi instead of rice and added more italian seasoning and garlic.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I actually found this in a Taste of Home magazine and they added 1/4 tsp more thyme.   This soup is fast, easy and tasty.  It is also extremely versatile.  I will add a large can of chicken when I am in a hurry.  I have used brown instant rice when I am in a pinch.  This soup has everything I have on hand.  I often will cook an entire bag of brown rice and freeze it in 2 cup baggies.  When I make this soup, I toss in the chicken and the frozen rice let it simmer and voila Serve it with garlic bread and salad it is a complete meal.  Try adding garbonzo beans as well.  You can't go wrong with this tasty little soup recipe.

My boyfriend loved this, he even had seconds. It only made about 6 servings for us. I used fat free/low sodium chicken broth, brown rice, and Splenda to make it healthier.

Since there is just two of us, I halved the recipe and froze what we didn't eat.  Just make sure you use a good jar of paste sauce. They all aren't the same.

I think this soup is wonderful!  It is very easy to make with ingredients that most people always have on hand.  Sometimes i make this soup as is, but other times i add carrots and zucchini and what ever other veggies i have in the fridge.  I also do half rice and half wild rice and it comes out perfect every time.  In the winter this is a go to meal that i make up in a snap!
