Wonderful! Smooth, spicy soup. Just the right amount of zip. I love it! 1-1/2 pounds is basically 2 medium sweet potatoes, and around 4 cups cubed.

I made this for a light Christmas lunch and everyone loved it! Even my mother-in-law wanted the recipe! (She usually does all the cooking)  I was proud of this soup and will serve it again for a special occasion.

This was good, but we liked the left-overs even more with two easy additions.  I thought the soup needed a little something, so I added a teaspoon of curry powder and a couple tablespoons of peanut butter to the remaining soup.  It was excellent!

An excellent soup. I tried this hoping it would be like the soup at a local restaurant. I added some extra cayenne for some kick and it was just like the restaurant. Rave reviews from my husband, too.

If I could have given this 3 and 1/2 stars, I would have.  I liked it, but I thought there was just a little too much ginger and nutmeg.  My husband thought it tasted like pumpkin pie soup!  I will definitely make this again, but with reduced nutmeg and ginger.  I think I'd also add some cumin, just to try it.

This is the best soup I have ever made. Seriously. It was exactly what I wanted it to be...creamy, sweet, with a little spice. YUM. My husband couldn't get enough...he said it was absolutely delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

A wonderful, savory soup.  I added about an 1/8 teaspoon of cardamom, and substituted a 12 ounce can of non-fat evaporated milk for the half-n-half.  Don't skimp on the onion and garlic!

This is an awesome recipe. I have a friend that just raves about it. I have had to make it for her several times now. I really like that it is relativly simple. I also think that the honey roasted peanuts really add something to this dish. Thank you for this recipe.

I used left over cooked sweet and white potatoes.  I still caramelized the potatoes in the pan.  I also added maybe 1-1/2 tsps of cayenne which really kicked it up.  No sugar.  No need for it.  The potatoes are sweet already.  Plus 2% milk instead of whole, which I had to keep adding as the soup kept thickening

I followed Andi's advice, added 2 tsp. yellow curry & 4 TBLSP peanut butter to the full pot of soup... served with a dollop of light sour cream. 
P.S.  I also had a carrot & 2 stems celery in with the onion, and used 4 c. vegetable broth (was the start of another recipe, then I found this one.)  A-Mazing recipe!

This was awesome & VERY easy to customize to my personal taste.  I totally NEVER add cream or anything to my soup & didn't on this one either, and I used fresh ginger instead.  It ROCKED!!  Delish!

We really enjoy this soup. We like using fresh ginger for an extra kick! It freezes okay and is easy to make in larger quantities.

I have, however, never been able to achieve the "spotty caramel color" in step three. Doesn't seem to matter much; the soup still comes out tasting delicious.

I'd probably go 4 1/2 as I needed to work on spices, and definitely didn't use as much ginger/nutmeg/cayenne as called for.  However, it gets the full five stars as it's packed with nutrition with low fat. Oh  yeah, I just used milk thicked with a bit of cornstarch which I threw in the blender to get the last bits of soup.    The instructions were great.   Thanks.

YUM! Loved this soup. I only had red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne pepper, but it turned out awesome. Great to warm us up after tobogganing!

This is fantastic!  I used jarred ginger, and lots of it.  It was amazing and my boyfriend who is a self proclaimed soup hater LOVED it.  Can't wait to have more for lunch today.

This came out great.  I made a mistake and added too much cayenne. To fix it I roasted a butternut squash and used an immersion blender to combine and it gave it a wonderful flavor.  Happy accidents are always welcome at my house.

This is a nice fall soup.  The spices are just right, and I love how the cayenne doesn't hit you at first, but sneaks up on you.  I bought honey roasted peanuts especially for this, but I don't think they added that much to it; in fact, I would use plain roasted peanuts in the future.

This came out very good, and the directions are clear and easy to adapt.  Very impressive end product.

I used curry powder and ham broth in mine and added ham.  

For more interesting texture blend the potatoes while still a little firm and then simmer with all ingredients to finish.

My family loved this recipe. The ginger gave the soup some 'heat' which is perfect for the fall. Combined with the nutmeg and pepper, it also made the soup smell heavenly as it cooked. It was very creamy. I substituted soy milk for the half and half. I forgot to get the peanuts, so I garnished with walnuts. We will certainly have this again!

Added curry and cumin. LOVED This! I make it quite often changing up ingredents. All in the ways, they still all turn out fabulous. I do cook potatoes night before in oven or mic to speed the process.

This is one of the richest, silkiest, velvetiest soups ive ever had.  This is so wonderful. The only alterations i made was using unsweeteded plain Silk soymilk and added one more clove of garlic.  This is so simple and so impressive.  I served it with a small side salad with a drizzle of caesar dressing and it was to die for!!

I really like this recipe. I halved the potatoes with butternut squash and halved the ginger and cayenne and omitted the nutmeg. Just for personal taste.  I also used Greek Yogurt instead of half and half. It gave it a tangy flavor.

If you do not have a blender, make it any way.  You can mash it with a fork, or just eat it as is. The flavor will still be tasty. I'd only had sweet potatoes cook one of three ways.  The combination of these flavors was a nice surprise.

It was amazing!! The portion is only enough for 2-3 people. Very good as is but when I make it again I will use fresh ginger to give it more of a ginger flavour.

I really liked this soup - I exchanged out the dairy for coconut milk (with cream) and it was very good.

It was ok.  Glad I tried it, but have other pureed sweet potato soup recipes I prefer.

It was lovely and spicey with a hint of sweetness. 
I didn't use the milk because the consistency was right after blending the soup. It will be a good vegan dish if the dairy is left out.

Loved this soup but my husband thought it was too spicy.  I'll cut the spices in half next time for him.

I make this exactly as suggested (but since I am a ginger fan, I add a lil extra) and I love it! So does everyone else who tastes it. I am always asked for the recipe. Whip it up as is and enjoy!

I had one large sweet potato that needed to be used, and 3 white potatoes, so I used those to make this soup.  I also substituted 2% milk instead of half-and-half or whole milk.  It turned out delicious!  I highly recommend it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This soup is amazing!  I used 3 large sweet potatoes, fresh ginger and only 1 cup of 5% cream because I like my cream soups thicker.  The soup is velvety smooth and very flavourful. I highly recommend you give it a try!

This soup was great! Used fresh ginger and doubled the spices to make it a little more spicy. Perfect on a cold night!

Thanks for this great recipe I will have to try this out for myself.  I have recently switched to a vegan diet and will most likely substitute some of those ingredients for my own personal use.

Yummy! Added carrots  bc sweet potatoes were to small to get the consistency that I wanted. I also added a tablespoon of turmeric and yum yum

Amazing. The ginger really brings out the flavour of this soup. I prefer my soup thicker so I only used 2 cups of chicken broth and i skipped the 1 1/2 cups half and half. It was really easy to make and everyone loved it!

It was okay. Made just as written,but it was missing something! Flavor was rather bland. Consistency was great - just missing something in the spice area.Offered 2 garnishes, the chopped honey roasted peanuts & ginger snap ccokies run through food processor to make crumbs. More people preferred the cookie crumbs.

I altered this recipe some so I can't rate it as is.  I added 1 teaspoon of French Four Spice (by Penzey's) and only one teaspoon of ginger.  I thought it was pretty bland so I added about 1/2 teaspoon cumin, about 1/8 teaspoon salt and about 1/8 teaspoon white pepper.  I also used whole milk instead of half and half.  Great recipe, will make again.  May increase the garlic next time.

Very nice and creamy! I wanted to taste the sweet potatoes and not taste like pumpkin pie so I cut the ginger back to 1 tsp. and used just a pinch of nutmeg and cayenne.  For the chicken broth I used 2 Knorr chicken cubes dissolved in the 3 cups of boiling water.

Great texture, great flavor!  I only used 1/16 tsp of the cayenne pepper and it's just enough!
