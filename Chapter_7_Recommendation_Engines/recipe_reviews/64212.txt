This is a GREAT recipe! Not only do they taste fabulous but I was looking for a cookie recipe that made at least 3 dozen. I am in a cookie swap that has 18 people in it so I needed to make 19 bags of 6 cookies in each (1 for the building security).  I made 3 batches and there was plenty left over.  Made 3 varibles of the recipes. Use 2.25 cups of oatmeal instead of 3 cups and they cookies come out really crispy. I then tried a batch w/choc chunks, then the butterscotch.  All 3 versions taste scrumptious!

These cookies are VERY good, but I made a few changes to my second batch after tasting the first (I thought they were TOO sweet).  Second time around I added more oats and less butterscotch chips, plus a few chocolate chips.  They were great, especially the day after!

This is one of my favorite cookies. Whenever I make them, even people who are not oatmeal fans like them!

We LOVED them!  We had to substitute the flour with Oat Flour because my daughter is allergic to wheat.  No one noticed!  That would be a great receipe on the wheat-free menu!

This is a huge hit with my kids.  My son took them to golf camp, along with many other cookies made by other families.  Ours were the first ones gone and requests have been made for more!
