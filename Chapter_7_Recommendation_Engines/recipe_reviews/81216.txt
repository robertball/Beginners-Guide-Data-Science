This is my second review of this dish.  The taste is good but the quantities are off.  The filling is not enough for more than 6-7 crepes.  I made it today again with 3 boneless chicken breas.ts  I boiled the chicken breasts, added garlic salt and chicken bouillon to the water.  I then used the cooking water for my broth.  I left out the tarragon, added 1/4 tsp rosemary and 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/8 tsp fresh black pepper and it made 6 nice sized crepes.   There is plenty of sauce.  So, if you are looking to make 12 crepes use more chicken  I love this recipe it is delicious and versatile.

I've made this a few times and always get compliments when I make it.  I use a little more tarragon than the recipe calls for, and I use egg substitute in place of the egg yolks.  Great flavor!

This came out quite well- although I recommend adding a lot more tarragon- maybe twice the amount, plus dashes of salt and pepper and onion powder.  We love onions here so I used about 1/2 cup of finely diced onions.  I also ended up baking the dish for 30 minutes (that's when it got nice and bubbly). Even though it was a lot of work, I really enjoyed putting a different kind of dish on the table, and everyone liked it alot. I served it with green beans almondine on the side.  Enjoy! :)

I'm not sure why the recipe showed 3 Crepes Recipes... I think maybe two (16 crepes) with the rest of the ingredients are plenty! Just my nickels worth! Thanks for trying it!

I made these using the leftovers from our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner.  I used poultry seasoning instead of the tarragon and mixed in my cranberry, apple, sausage stuffing with the turkey and cream sauce.  I served it with cranberry sauce.  Ding, ding, ding!  We got a winner.

My family enjoyed these for Bastille Day, I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled the Tarragon in the sauce and added a pinch of salt.  We used left over chicken and the flavor was very nice with some depth and silky smooth rich.  I served this along with French Onion Soup.

really tasty and relatively easy, although next time I will make the crepes in advance, and I will shred the chicken instead of cubing it.  Yum!

The tarragon taste in this was superb, after doubling the quantity of tarragon.  We loved the sauce.  Used pre-made buckwheat crepes and can't say we loved them.  Would make again and serve over rice or egg noodles.

I served this on Christmas day.  I was looking for something different.  I lilked the fact that I could do the crepes a couple days ahead, and then refrigerate them until I used them.  This was a good dish...not a WOW dish, but a good one.

Time-consuming to make and totally bland. After making as directed, it tasted like bland biscuit gravey.  I started dumping spices in to try to add flavor and redeem it.  It still made blah, unattractive, soggy crepes despite my best efforts. Definitely will not repeat, and no idea how to salvage recipe, so won't try.

I asked my mom what she'd give this since I didn't like it at all and she said 2 and a half to 3 stars. My dad ended up putting ketchup on it. I followed it exactly and it was just kinda bland and a little funny tasting. I'm sorry.

This is very very good!  Nice to have something different on the table every now and then.  Defiantly time consuming, I would make the crepes ahead of time.  Better when you double the amt. of tarragon.  I am wheat/gluten/dairy intolerant so I made my crepes with Pamela's Baking Mix (I used the crepe recipe on the bag) and replaced the milk in this recipe with rice milk and the flour with rice flour. For my husband's crepes I used the recipe on your website- very good.  It says to make 3 batches of crepes but you really only need to make 2 batches.  I think the 3 must be a typo.  I will defiantly be making this again and again!

This was AMAZING! I have celiacs so I used my own recipe for the crepes, but the filling was to die for.  I used turkey.  mmmmm.

I decided to give these 4 stars because my husband really loved them  I, unfortunately, can't go by my own tastebuds right now, because I'm newly pregnant and am repulsed by anything with chicken!  But these were quite good, and I followed the recipe almost to a T. Great with baked apples as a side and served with a few drops of lemon juice on top.  I made the crepes from a different cookbook and made a little extra sauce.

WOW.  I actually used turkey sausage instead of chicken or turkey to make these with a more breakfast-y taste, and they were a huge hit!  For those pesky eaters who hate eggs in the morning, this was great.    I used a heart-healthy crepe recipe and substituted some low-fat margarine for butter, and I don't think anyone noticed.  I think if I DON'T make these again, my husband will leave me.

I used the crepe recipe from asparagus chicken crepe recipe because I have made those before and turned out perfect.  I did double the crepe recipe(which was plenty had some left over) and did not put wax paper between each one….no need as they do not stick…just stacked them on a plate like you would do for pancakes.  I used a small non-stick skillet and moved in a circle motion to evenly distribute.  I boiled my chicken tenders with garlic powder, Italian seasonings and salt/pepper.  This way I have my chicken broth for the recipe. I then shredded the chicken breast so it would be easier to eat.  This was good but could of used a little more flavor..like some fresh garlic and seasoning. I even double the tarragon. I will make again but experiment with different ingredients like mushrooms and maybe some red peppers.

Easy crepe recipe with a great taste. It needed some more salt in the mixture, but I still loved it. Takes quite a while though.

Tasty and different way to use leftover turkey. I halved the recipe and it made enough for two, so the 12 servings is a bit misleading. I ended up filling 4 crepes with the 1/2 recipe. I also didn't thin the cream sauce at the end, just poured it over the crepes before baking.

I added sauteed mushrooms to the turkey sauce to give it a little more  flavor. Would add additional herbs like sage or tarragon next time.

I love this.  The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that I agree with others that it needs more tarragon.  I made it the way the recipe reads to the point where I tasted the sauce with the chicken in it. At that moment I knew I needed to change a few things.  I had some sauteed mushrooms, onion and garlic in the freezer so I threw that into a skillet and warmed it up.  I added that to the mix and added about another tblsp of tarragon.  I added a tad more broth to it to thin it slightly because adding the extra veggies made it thicker.  After adding those items, I continued with the precise recipe and it was fabulous.  I will definitely make it again for  the family.

Good- but needs additional seasoning. I added some garlic salt at the table. I also added sauteed mushrooms and cooked asparagus spears to the chicken.

This recipe turned out great! Even though I used the wrong kind of broth, beef instead of chicken, because I was rushing and not paying attention. I would cut the flour in half next time though.

Loved this recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly the way it is written. I was in a hurry with no time to cook chicken so I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it. It was so moist and full of flavor it definitely added to the creeps. I also added white pepper to the sauce for a little more flavor. Everyone loved it.
