The stew was really good. I did use less allspice. A very tasty dish for lamb!

While I liked the stew I altered two things as I thought them to be suspicious.  First I cooked the lamb cubes for 15 minutes, rather than 25 minutes, and that resulted in more of the meat being like pulled lamb rather than chunks of lamb.  Second, I only used 1 teaspoon of allspice thinking one Tablespoon was too much, and I was glad I made that decision.  
 We like plenty of thickened liquid in a stew so I used extra water and thickened with corn starch.  I expect the pureed corn was for thickening, but it really didn't do a thing.

Great recipe. Just need to tweak cooking time for meat next time. Will be great with crunchy bread.

Definitely will make again.  The only thing I changed was that I threw in a chicken bullion cube instead of the chicken soup base because I didn't have any, and I used chicken stock instead of some of the water to hopefully not lose flavor.  It was even better the second day as leftovers!

Very good stew.  I didn't go with all the spices as I wanted to be able to taste the meat. I cooked it for only 20 minutes and it was excellent - tender and tasty. My first time using a pressure cooker.

This is really good!  I loved the end result but had to change it to fit my taste.  However, the recipe is great and I have given it to several friends who have made it and said, "I made that recipe you gave me but it was nothing like what we had at your house."  I then tell them the changes I made and several admitted they liked this one better.  Proof that it is worth *****

THanks,!
