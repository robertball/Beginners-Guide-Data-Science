I just made three jars for gifts and they look great! As for the jar problem, Classico pasta sauce comes in 26 oz heavy mason jars.(Just soak off the label). They are almost square which shows off the mix beautifully, plus a regular mason lid, metal or plastic, fits perfectly. I use these jars for canning since they're so pretty and right between pint and quart size. I also put the pasta in small plastic bags and knotted them to prevent spilling when removing from the jar.

We're giving soup and brownie mixes for gifts this year and LOVE this soup!  It has excellent flavor and texture (my husband is a chef, so we are particular about our dining).

We only made a few modifications to the recipe--reduced rice to 1/4 cup (we used Jasmine rice), reduced tomatoes to 1 14.5 oz. can (28 oz. was just too much-- it overpowered the rest of the ingredients), and used 1 tbsp fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Perfect!  I know it will be a big hit with our friends and family this year!

WOW!  I made 36 of these for Christmas gifts(Buy stock in Walmart as that's where I got all my ingredients and the jars :).  I took others suggestions and used 2  8 oz. cans of tomato sauce and 1 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I gave the soup mix along with a wooden spoon, the can of tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce in a gift bag with a box of corn muffin mix.  (The only thing the recipient had to provide was the ground beef, garlic powder, pepper and water).  Needless to say, it was a HUGE hit and everyone that has tried this LOVES it.  This recipe makes a ton, but those that had company over the holidays appreciated this no fuss meal that served a gang  THANKS SO MUCH!  Again, my dogs got a sampling in their dog food which they gave 5 stars to also.  GREAT RECIPE

I made up three jars to give as gifts and they're SO pretty. I used quart-sized jars and it all fit nicely...but not snug. Put the bouillon granules at the bottom, then the peas. It looks better.

I could have made four gift jars at least, but I decided to make a batch for my house tonight. It's super easy to put together and it's delicious. It made way more than my family could eat, so I'm freezing a couple quarts for my up-coming maternity leave.

This soup is delicious! I will definitely make these as christmas gifts! I made a few changes to the recipe: Used 1x14.5oz can chopped tomatoes (like others suggested), used 1/4 cup onion soup mix instead of onion flakes, substituted garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and used bite size flank steak/chopped steak instead of ground beef. No added salt or seasoning needed once all done! Great fast and easy recipe!

I gave this recipe 5 star rating only if you eliminate one can of tomato paste and add two cans tomato sauce...much smoother!

Best soup I've ever made!  Very healthy and hearty for a cold, rainy day!  The only thing I would do different is use only 1 can (14 oz.) tomatoes and use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste.  Otherwise, it's very easy and very good!

This soup was so good! My three year old asked for seconds! I followed other reviewer's advice and added fresh minced garlic, 1/4 cup rice and a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes. The leftovers were even tastier! I served this with parmesan cheese and crescent rolls. I will definitely make this again, and share it with friends!

This is BEAUTIFUL gift that tastes really great!  I used to be a teacher and one of my students gave me the soup mix as a gift for Christmas and it was fantastic!  It was almost too pretty to eat, but I am so glad that I made it and even happier that I found the recipe on the net so that I can make it for others and share what has become one of my favorite soup recipes:)

I'm planning on giving these as holiday gifts this year, so I wanted to try it out first.  I wasn't disappointed!  This is a really easy, tasty and low-cost recipe.  The presentation got lots of compliments from my extended family before I even made it.  And then they really enjoyed it for dinner...even the picky eaters.  The only modifications I made were to use half French lentils and half red lentils since they add such nice color and cook up great.  I also added 1/2 cup dehyrated diced carrots on the top layer just under the pasta and think this was an excellent addition.  And then I used one 10-ounce can tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, and only one 15-ounce can diced tomatoes.  Served with grated Parmesan cheese on top and a green salad on the side...Yum!  P.S. the 1-quart jars I had on-hand worked out fine, though next time I think I'll use wide-mouth jars for easier filling...using a funnel really helped too.  Hint: for decorative canning labels I went to MyOwnLabels.com and made beautiful custom lid labels for a reasonable price!

YUM!! i made these for christmas gifts. i thought i would try the recipe before i gave them away :) i made the soup last night and it was very tasty!! all of the ingredients are super cheap, so these make perfect gifts if you have several people to give to. i used clear treat bags instead of jars (bags are much cheaper). the only issue i had was that i couldnt find beef boullion granules so i just smashed up a bunch of the cubes. it takes 12 cubes per jar/bag (whatever). i followed the recipe exactly and i think this recipe is a keeper!

So good!  I made this to see if I wanted to do it for gifts and it's a go!  My husband even liked it and he is not a soup guy.  I made it with "Buttery Corn Bread."  I used 1 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also used stew meat instead of ground beef.

I gave this 4 stars because I think it's  too salty.  I think 1/4 of bouillon is perfect.  I used clear treat bags instead of jars to save money.  This makes a great christmas gift if you're trying to avoid all the sweets.

I gave several jars of this soup mix to friends this Christmas. I packed it in Christmas-themed jars I bought at the dollar store and our local secondhand store. I was a little nervous because I didn't have time to taste-test the soup.  Every single one of my friends has given me rave reviews! I highly recommend this recipe and wouldn't change a thing!

Yum! I recieved this as a gift & it was delicious-- I did use tomato paste, I just made sure it was really well blended with the beef before adding water. The house smelled delicious & the soup was perfect for a chilly winter day! I will definitely make this for others as a gift... it's great!

I gave this as gifts at Christmas and everyone that I've heard back from loved it!  Made it myself and also changed the tomato paste to 2 cans and 1 can of tomatoes.  I also used 1 and 1/2 pounds of hamburger and added chili powder and the end just enough to cover the top of the soup.  I couldn't find alphabet pasta but did find mini stars which worked out just fine. It was easy to put together.  Will make again!  Great job fellow Hoosier!

I haven't made this yet so I didn't want to rate it (but can't post without giving a rating so I'll go with 5 stars to avoid penalizing the recipe unfairly) I do want to use it for Christmas gifts. I am concerned that some folks say the peas and lentils aren't done enough. I wonder if the instructions ought to say to add the jar ingredients to the cooked beef with WATER initially but not with the tomato products? When cooking any legume, acidic ingredients like tomatoes will prevent them from getting tender so those ingredients should be added later. My lentils--cooked as lentils--usually cook in 25 minutes (package says 15-20) so I wonder if early addition of the tomatoes have prevented them getting done in 45 minutes in this recipe?

I'm rating the soup jars, not the soup since I didn't make it. It is very pretty in the jars.  I ended up getting a mixture of regular lentils and orange lentils- and green spit peas and yellow split peas. It looked great. I made 10 of these for friends and they just loved it, one of my recipients said he used Italian sausage and people were licking the bowl! I made this with "Easy Beer Bread" mix from this site and was told they go perfect together.

I thought this was very good. Followed the suggestions of others reduced the tomatos to 15 oz, and instead of tomato paste, substituted 15 oz. of tomato sauce. Also reduced beef bouillon to 3 TBS. 
I made 25 batches for Christmas gifts. Instead of using jars, I just used quart sized zip-lock bags, and a small sandwich bag for the pasta, that fit into the quart-sized bag with everything else.  I also supplied  the cans of diced tomatos tomato sauce, so all they needed to buy was 1# of ground beef.  I put it all in a nice gift bag, with 2 packages of corn bread mix to make and serve with the soup. A complete meal gift (except for the beef!)  My friends and family loved it.

I tried this recipe before making the gifts. I cut it in half for just the two of us. It still made enough for us for two meals. Really good! Amazing flavor. To make as gifts, I cut everything in half and put it in clear bags that I got at a party shop. Tied it up with pretty ribbon, attached the directions, and gave it as Christmas gifts. For very special people, I took one of your reader's advice and made a gift basket with a 14-1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 8 oz. tomato sauce (I found this combination to work really well), a box of Jiffy cornbread mix, and a small loaf of cranberry bread. The only thing to add was 1/2 lb. ground beef. As I type this, I have a pot of Friendship soup simmering on the stove. It's a rainy, cold Sunday afternoon. Yum. Although I used this as Christmas gifts, it could be used so many times during the year -- especially when you have new neighbors.

We received this as a gift and it was really good... best of all, the Kids loved it!!  We added mushrooms to it and instead of the pasta, we added cheese filled tortellini which made it a little bit more of a "hearty" meal

This was really good.  I made it for gifts and have had compliments from the receivers.  I did have trouble finding regular barley so I used instant and it turned out fine.  Will be making this one again.

Excellent soup!  I made this for neighbors for a Christmas gift, they loved it.  Instead of using jars I used small cello bags tied with a red and green ribbon.  Made the soup for my family and was surprised that my kids ate it. (I didn't tell them it was good for them.)  After reading all the reviews I decided to use one can of petite diced tomatoes and instead of tomato paste I used sauce also I added a handful more of small shell pasta.  Will make again!!!!

This is my first time ever writing a review.  I love this soup.  Just got done making 6 jars for Christmas gifts and made a pot for dinner.  It was delicious.  I've never had a soup with hamburger in it.  I was a little skeptical but it is yummy!  Mine fit nicely in quart size jars.  I added 1/2 cup split dried yellow peas and the jar filled perfectly and added another splash of color.  Don't hesitate to make these as gifts!  Great idea!

This soup is excellent!  It makes quite a bit, but no one in my house complained about eating it a few times!  From the advice in all the other reviews, I used fresh minced garlic, 2-10 oz. cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis (instead of the 28 oz. can), 1-15 oz. can of tomato sauce (instead of the paste) and small star pasta.  It was perfect.  The ingredients provide lots of different textures, and it is not a heavy soup.  Thanks Bea!

all I can say is yummy!. I forgot to add the tomato paste, but it made a nice light brothy soup without it. I will be giving this out as gifts.

I LOVE this soup!  I make jars of it every year and make a couple pots for us too.  It's such a hearty, tasty soup!  I usually use Italian sausage instead of ground beef and seasoned diced tomatoes (Red Gold onion, garlic & basil) just to add a bit more flavor.

I included this jar and recipe in my gift bags this year.  The feedback I have received, is that the peas and lentils do not cook completely.  Has anyone else ever experienced this problem?  It does look incredible, but I would hope the recipe included, will result in something edible.  I will provide a rating, based on the ease of preparing the jars, and the visual aspect.  I do however, want to understand the instructions for preparation.  If anyone has prepared this soup successfully, please let me know what we are doing wrong.  Thank you in advance.

Only rating 4 stars, since I have only made the jars.  Turned out super cute!  Used green and yellow split peas and multi colored twist pasta.  Also made the Easy Beer Bread Mix from this site to add.  UPDATE:  Made the soup and it was really good.  Make sure you use a big pot (8 qt plus) and let the peas cook till really soft.  Everyone loved this.

Made these jars up for Christmas gifts. Everyone has raved about how great this soup is... I make it up often for gifts now-- especially for my "uncle in law" that has cancer.

Beautiful presentation, but I thought the soup was really lacking something. It just wasn't rich enough for me. If I made it again, I would add something, although I'm not sure what.

Great "Italian" tasting soup plus it makes a great gift idea.  Gave these to both people who liked to cook and those who did not.  It is so easy, anyone can make it.  It made a lot when we tried it so it lasted for a few days at our house, but it seemed to taste better each day.  I browned stew meat (cut into small cubes), tossed in flour and garlic powder and browned in a little olive oil.  I used a smaller 15 oz can of diced tomatos and 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of paste.  We garnished the soup with parmesan cheese on top and it was really good.  I made these up as gifts, putting them in wide mouth quart size mason jars with Christmas fabric on top.  I gave them in a holiday basket with cotton "snow" lining the basket.  I added the tomato cans, a wooden spoon and a box of corn muffin mix along with the recipe card to make it a complete gift.  These were a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made Friendship Soup, I gave it a low review because the tomato paste made it unappetizing and I didn't like the combination of both the rice AND the pasta. I made it again last night by using an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of paste, a 14.5 oz. can of Italian style diced tomatoes, no rice and double the pasta (whole wheat spirals), and it was a winner with my best friend, boyfriend, and me. I didn't have bouillion on hand so I used 2 packets of onion soup mix instead and seasoned it accordingly. I also couldn't find barley, so I doubled the lentils. I served it with cornbread, but garlic bread would be wonderful too. I could see this recipe being a wonderful starter for minestrone soup -- just add your own carrots, zucchini, potatoes, spinach, whatever. Yum :-)

I wanted to try the recipe at home before giving it as Xmas gifts this year.  My family thought it was excellent.  Now that I want to give the soup mix as gifts, I'm having trouble located the 1-12 pint jars; all I am able to find are pint  quart size jars?  Any suggestions???

We found that cooking for 45 minutes plus the additional 15 left certain ingredients mushy. The split peas and lentils seemed to need more time to cook, but the pasta and barley were over cooked. We also added about 3 more bouillon cubes plus other spices.

Before giving as gifts this year, I made the soup myself and it was very good.  After reading many of the reviews, I also used 2 cans of tomato sauce in place of the tomato paste and one can of diced tomatoes.  I also used minced garlic with the ground beef instead of garlic powder.  I didn't have any pearl barley and couldn't find any at my local store so I omitted it from the recipe and slightly increased the split peas and lentils and I really don't think it made that much of a difference.  Also, my personal preference is pasta in soup and not rice and I thought having both was a bit much so I also omitted the rice and increased the pasta to 1 cup.  I used ditalini pasta instead of the alphabet pasta.  Overall it came out great and was very quick and easy to make.

I absolutely love this recipe! My family thinks it is great also. I have some in a pot on the stove right now, as a matter of fact--great for a chilly night like tonight. I wouldn't change a thing and I also added a carrot and stalk of celery to my first batch, which just made it all the better. In tonight's batch I am going to add two carrots and a parsnip. This is just a really great recipe and I can't thank you enough. A++++++++++

Like others, I made this up to give out as gifts this Christmas and it was a big hit - most people thought I purchased it!  I put the jar in a decorative basket along with a soup ladle tied with a pretty ribbon.  The jar I used was bigger than needed, so I just wrapped the pasta in seasonal plastic wrap, then stuffed more in the top to hold things in place.  I made the soup for myself too -- it makes a HUGE batch (better have a big pot!) and was really good -- nice and thick and filling.  I froze it in single serving sizes and have been bringing it to work for lunch.  Heats up well in the microwave and is just as good the 2nd time around.  Thanks!

I wasn't so sure about this soup, not being a fan of split peas and lentils, but Oh WOW!!  This was soo great!  I decreased the water by about a half a quart, like some one mentioned earlier, and I loved the thick consistancy.  I substituted buffalo meat for the beef, used tiny star pasta, and use a 14oz can of crushed tomatoes w/spicy chili peppers, and a 14oz can of crushed tomato with garlic, also used tomato sauce instead of paste.  This was sooo good!! I'm glad I tested out the recipe b/f sending out the gifts, b/c I doubt I would have made it otherwise.  And now I'm putting this in my fav recipe rotation! I also could only find the 1 pint jars and the 1 quart, so I think I'll try using the pint and having the pasta in a little bag atached w/ a ribbon.

Made about 14 of these for Christmas gifts this year.  Gave them to family and co-workers.  We saved pasta sauce and saurkraut jars that worked well for storage containers.  The hardest part was finding large containers where they sold beef bouillon and found this at Sam's Club.

I made these yesterday for Christmas gifts and they look great! I got all my ingredients at Wal-Mart (super cheap) and 1 quart mason jars at Michael's. I found the ingredients fit just fine in a 1 quart jar when I added 3/4 cup of the pasta instead of 1/2 cup. Made some cute labels in Microsoft Publisher and plan on wrapping these in an apron and tying with ribbon! Great gift. I also made a pot of this soup while assembling the gifts with ground turkey - and it was fantastic. Took the suggestion of using 14oz diced tomatoes and fresh garlic. YUM!

Great soup!  Before I gave this out as Christmas gifts, I made some for us first.  It's a favourite!  Makes a hearty meal in the winter months when served with a nice multigrain bread.  Good for large groups since it makes a very large pot.  Freezes well too.

This is a super tasty soup recipe that makes a ton and freezes well. Instead of using a jar I used plastic goodie bags and they worked just as well, the contents shifted a little bit but they still looked pretty and it was much cheaper than buying a bunch of jars.  Just a suggestion.

fun to make and great to eat. I made a bunch of these to have on hand for when I'm in a pinch for a meal.Scaled the recipe down to serve 4. I usually will toss another handful of any shaped pasta that I have on hand to beef it up a little; it's definitely not necessarily though. This is hearty enough to be a meal. Add a loaf of French Bread &/or a salad and you're set!

This is a great recipe!  We've been eating it about once a week this winter.  Instead of onion flakes, I just cook a diced onion with the ground beef, skip the boullion, and double the pasta.  Who would have thought my family would ENJOY split peas and lentils?  We always eat it with cornbread, and I include a cornbread mix when I give it as a gift.

Fantastic idea for housewarming and hostess gifts.  All my friends loved it.  I substituted ground turkey for a little less calorie - 6 WW points for 8 servings.

I made this soup prior to packaging it for gifts.  We were not crazy about the ground beef so I suggested leftover chicken, turkey or beef as a substitute or leaving out the meat on my recipe card.  It makes a huge pot of soup and is very hearty.  I also substituted rainbow twist pasta rather than alphabet for extra color in the jar.

I tried it as specified without changing it and I find that it was too mushy.

Since then, I've not added rice or pasta. But added vegetables (carrots, cabbage, onions, celery). And different kinds of beans. Make for a complete healthy meal.

A nice, homemade gift when topped with a fabric square, tied with a ribbon and attached recipe.  I gave this to friends for Christmas and it was a hit.

I'm sorry, I followed the recipe exactly and just didn't find this soup at all flavorful. Because of all the great reviews, I will try it again, but this time I will follow others suggestions by using 14 oz of diced and seasoned tomatoes (rather than 28 oz), a can of tomato sauce (rather than paste), a package of dry onion soup mix (rather than the minced onion), and double either the rice or pasta, (stead of using both).

I received this as a gift from my sister and it was fabulous!!  Not only does it look pretty in the jar but it taste wonderful!  Instead of putting beef granules in the jar my sister instructed to make soup with 10 cups of beef stock instead of 10 cups of water (saved her money).  I simply dissolved 10 beef bouillon cubes in 10 cups of water.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and used a can of tomato soup instead of the tomato paste.  My husband and 6-year-old LOVED it... they both had seconds and my husband begged me to get the recipe so we can make it again.

I gave this out as gifts this year and my goodness, what a reception! This soup is wonderful. It looks nice in the jars and tastes sooo good. The baskets had this soup mix, the can of tomatoes, the tomato sauce, a big ladle, and a package of corn bread. Every thing they'd need except the meat. (I filled in with some other little homemade treats.) It made up a very nice basket. Everyone loved them. Thanks for a truly wonderful post. I will surely be using this again!

The flavor of this soup is great, but the split peas take much longer than everything else to cook.  I suggest using another lentil instead.  Make sure to add the macaroni at the end, as it takes very little cooking time.

I made this up and gave it out in jars.  It was very pretty and it tastes great.  For my taste, I would decrease the barley and use tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes and paste.

I used 2 packs of onion soup mix in place of the bouillon granules and onion flakes and I omitted the bay leaves.  It worked out great.  Any pasta will work for the alphabet pasta.
The soup is quite thick, and will need stirred often to keep from burning.  Adding more water helps.
I used  1 1/2 lbs. ground beef and it was quite satisfying.

Soup was great!  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  The only changes I made were to substitute 2 eight ounce cans of tomato sauce for the 6 ounce can of tomato paste and I substituted one-third a cup of beef base for the beef boullion powder.

Made this for Christmas gifts and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. I did add a soup ladle with the jar and the canned tomatoes. I used diced tomatoes and tomato sauce as other reviewers recommended. I saved one jar for us and it is very delicious, makes a lot! Thanks for sharing, Bea!

I tested out the recipe before assembling the ingredients for gift-giving.  Instead of tomato paste, I used tomato sauce & added 2 extra cups of water because there was WAY too much bouillon and it made the soup salty.  My split peas didnt get soft, even after an hour of cooking...nor were they soft the next day as left-overs.  Not sure how long they'd need to be cooked in order for them to not be crunchy.  Overall, the soup was good, more of a stew, really, because it was super thick (even after the addition of extra water).  I enjoyed the variety of textures with the different grains.  It made A LOT of soup, though, so I halved the recipe (and changed the instructions to use sauce instead of paste, add extra water & cook longer) & layered ingredients in small clear cellophane bags, tied with pretty ribbon. I made 25 gift bags & am hoping the recipients enjoy this unique "st-oup."

This makes great soup.  I use italian sausage as my meat and add diced carrots about 5 minutes after the pasta.  I do not use the tomato paste.

good, but way, way, WAY too much salt. The amount of bullion cubes was just too much for that amount of water. I counted about 15 for 12 cups of water. we needed to add a ton more water. I recommend eating in it one night as the pasta gets mushy quickly. Thanks for sharing

This was very good soup.   I followed other reviewers tips and used tomato sauce and a 15 ounce can of tomatoes.  It looked very pretty in the jar with the bullion at the bottom as some reviewers recommended.   I would have given it 5 strs, but it was not "knock your socks off good".

This was wonderful! I tried it with both beef and chicken, and while I prefer the chicken, my family prefered the beef. I just used left over chicken, and used the chicken bouillon. Very good. My one issue was when I rinsed the peas,lentils, and barly they did not dry well which caused my bouillon to absorb the moisture in the jar. It stuck to the bottom of the jar, so I had to add more when making the soup. Also I had to buy jars and the 2 pint size worked just fine, I upped the pasta to 2/3rds cup. This makes great gifts!!1 I also used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, and a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes.

This recipe was great. I gave it to friends and my boss for Christmas gifts. Several asked for the ingredient list and others appreciated a healthier type of gift after so many sweets. I used the recommendations for jasmine rice and tomato sauce. I thought it could use some  additional spices and vegetables but overall was pleased with the outcome.

I tried this recipe before giving it as Christmas gifts and both my husband and I agreed that it was yummy!  It does make a lot so plan on freezing some or I just took it for lunch all week with some Italian bread.  I followed other people's recommendations and used less rice, added chili powder, used tomato sauce instead of paste and included elbow macaroni.  My mason jars were too big and I had to fill the extra room with tissue paper but they still turned out really cute!  Thanks for this great recipe, I can't wait to give them out.

I used this as gifts for friends and family for Christmas presents three years running...I wasn't sure I would have time this year, and I had people CALL me and ask if I was making "the soup" this year!! Also great made with a rotel type of tomatoes and diced or ground chickin if you aren't a beef fan.  Good luck!

This was awesome!  We made about 15 of them for Christmas presents and got rave reviews from all our friends.  One friend told me she made it with sausage instead of ground beef and it was delicious.  Great recipe!

I can't rate this recipe based on flavor, so I'm rating it based on it's attractiveness as a gift.  I couldn't find the 1-1/2 pint jars, so I used 1-pint jars, reduced the amount of rice by a tiny bit, and tied the baggie of pasta on the outside of the jar.  It was a beautiful presentation and my gift recipients really liked the idea.  I also mixed up baggies of Easy Beer Bread Mix (from this site) to give with the soup mix so they would have a complete meal ready to mix up.  UPDATE (1/26/09) - My parents received one of these from me as a Christmas gift.  They called last night to tell me they had made the soup and, to use my father's words, "It is fantastic!  I ate two bowls and was sorry I was too full for a third!"

I took the risk of giving this soup as a gift before trying it myself...based on all the rave reviews I figured I could. I put on the recipe card to use one can tomato sauce and one can tomato chunks. I also used veggie broth instead of beef, and left out the rice, as rice and noodles seemed redundant. I doubled the pasta instead.

Well, I finally made it myself, and it was really good! Not as good as fresh soup of course, but better than canned. And so easy!

One thing: I got 1 liter (1 quart) jars, and they were too big. I had to stuff tissue paper in the top to make it all fit.

Great recipe for gifts. I cut the recipe in half for about 4 servings (much more manageable for smaller families). I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and used Acini Di Pepe pasta instead of barley pearls.

I plan on giving this as Christmas gifts this year and tried it out tonight to see how we like it.  DELICIOUS!  As others suggested, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as written.  I thought the rice and pasta worked well together and it had plenty of flavor.  For myself, I may add crushed red pepper flakes and some frozen vegetables next time.  For gifts, I'll make some with chicken granules.  I plan on packing it in 1 qt. jars with the cans of tomatoes and sauce and a package of crackers.  Put everything in a basket and add a ladle for the finishing touch.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'm sure everyone will want a copy of it.  :)

Haven't actually tried this myself but I made up a bunch of jars to go in my Christmas baskets.  It looked really nice layered. SO PRETTY IN 1 QUART JARS!  The only thing I did different was instead of adding boulion granules, I actually placed 5 cubes of boulion squares in a plastic bag just below the plastic bag of pasta.  I couldn't find the granules so this is all that I could make work.  I sure hope it tastes good and not justs look pretty!!!  Once I try it myself I will update.

We made this a couple of years ago for Christmas presents and they were a huge hit.  Not only does the soup taste great, it looks really impressive when layered in glass jars.

I haven't made this recipe in a long time but remember that I loved it!(I have too many cookbooks and recipes so I forget what I have until I come upon it) Will be making again very soon now that I found again! I gave as gifts to teachers and family and also made a batch for my family. Only changes~layer bouillon granules first on bottom of jar when giving as a gift. I used 1 pint of home canned tomatoes and 1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce.

I thought this was absolutely delicious, I did add extra garlic (fresh) and next time will use a different pasta then i did this time, and try with chicken instead of burger, but super easy and inexpensive.Even my sometimes picky children asked for seconds.

This is both beautiful to give and delicious to eat.  The soup is something different than most people make in a hurry, but making the mix ahead provides people a chance to have a fun new meal with not much work.

A friend of mine gave me a jar of this soup for a gift.  It was really good!  My family is not big on soup, but they went back for seconds!  Now, I'm on-line getting the recipe because my husband asked that we make it again!  There's not many ground beef soups that I've found, this one is easy and very good.

YUMMY!!!  Not only is this soup tasty, but it's easy to make as well.  Plus, everything was right on the mark.  It was seasoned just right, the cooking time was perfect (which surprised me,  I thought the lentils and peas would still be slightly undercooked).  It was also a beautiful, and very inexpensive, gift (thanks to the person who suggested recycling Classico spaghetti jars-- just the right size, and a classier look than Kern jars-- just bought new lids. (I gave this jar of soup along with a Pampered Chef jar opener for teacher gift, so they got one thing to enjoy, and one to last -- both made at least one night in the kitchen easier) Our family enjoyed this soup for all it offered.  Sincere thanks for sharing.

I love this as a gift idea!  Everyone gets candy and cookies at this time of year, and I love having a healthier option for people (which fits my personality).  I love how pretty it looks, layered in a jar.  I added a tsp. of chili powder (not spicy, just flavorful) with the Italian seasoning, which kicked up the color in the jar.

I also had a very rough time finding jars.  I finally found Pint sized canning jars at ONE grocery store in town.  Then I put the pasta in a Christmas "treat bag" with a twist tie and tied it to the jar, along with the recipe card, with a Christmas ribbon.  They are very cute.

The only *bad* thing about this soup is how it looks after it's made.  That is not appealing at all, but it tastes good and both of my boys (4 years old) ate it all....which is saying something.

This looks very pretty in the jars.  I followed the tip of one of the reviewers and used 1/2 green and 1/2 red lentils - made a big difference in presentation.  I made up a jar for my family and my pot wasn't quite big enough so only used 2 quarts of water.. turned out thick and rich.. yumm

I gave this as a gift to co-workers last Christmas, and they all appreciated it -- especially since I gave it a week before Christmas, which is usually fast-food time for all of us on the go.  Also, I went to Big Lot's and bought cheap but cute jars with air-tight lids to layer the soup mix in.

A nutritious hearty soup.  I liked it, husband and son ate it but said they were not impressed.  I guess they are not soup kinda guys.  It was easy and good.  I would recommend this to all.

I gave this soup out as gifts this year and everyone loves it.  I have not tried it myself yet but will do so soon.  I couldn't find a 3 cup jar so I used 1 quart jars and added a layer of wild rice, about 1/2 cup, and added a little extra pasta to fill jar.  Also I put the pasta in a sandwich bag on the top so it would be easy to remove as one does not use the pasta until the soup is made. Thanks

I put this soup mix together and gave it as Christmas gifts. I have had rave reviews from people who made it. I made it and thought it was a bit salty (I'm a bit sensitive to salt in food) but the rest of the family couldn't get enough of it. The recipe makes ALOT as written, so it is best to give as a gift to a family, not a single or couple. Unles, the single or couple have a bunch of hungry friends. I have a family of four, two of us love soup and had leftovers for a few days but there was still quite a bit left over after 4 days. Well, the pasta turned to mush and I sent about two servings through the garbage disposer. SO, if you plan on making this or giving it, be aware that the pasta does not hold up well. Other than that, awesome soup!!

We loved this!  Family members raved about the presentation of this as gifts, and we just made our first pot at home, and it was easy and delicious!  We made exactly as written, except using a 14.5 ounce can of tomatoes instead of 28.

Lovely gift, excellent soup, inexpensive, and easy to prepare.  I just bought more of everything to make additional jars.  I did use tomato sauce instead of the paste and dilatini pasta because I couldn't find the alphabet pasta.  Delish!

This soup was so good. I did not use the tomato paste, instead I used 1-15oz can of tomato sauce and 1-14.5oz of diced tomatoes w/basil, garlic, and oregano. I also used bow-tie pasta, which I doubled. This made a really big pot of soup. I will be giving these out for Christmas and stocking my pantry. Thanks for sharing!

Gave this as gifts last year, really cheap to make. Was a awesome gift, easy to layer ingrediebrs with a funnel. It isn't the best soup EVER, but as a gift to people who may not cook often, it's close.

I gave this a Christmas presents to family and coworkers.  I didn't have time to test it myself ahead of time but went with it because the reviews are good and so far I have had several requests for the recipe.  I did make the few small change that everyone else suggested (tomato sauce instead of pasted) and a smaller can of diced tomatoes.

I gave this soup last year as gifts and it was a huge success!  I had several extra jars that I saved for us, but whenever I went to the pantry to pull one out, I'd found my daughter had given them all away to friends who'd had the soup and wanted to make more!

I wanted a healthy, good soup to give out in jars for this Christmas.  This recipe had rave reviews, so I tried it before giftgiving.  I thought that the soup was mediocre.  It was a bit bland, and I will not be giving it away as gifts.  Maybe I didn't like it because I am not a bean lover ... although I do like Chili.  Thanks for the recipe though.

While it looks pretty in the jar, and is a hearty, healthy soup, it does need a kick. Try doubling the spices and adding some crushed red peppers and you'd have a winner. The Classico spaghetti sauce jar did work great.

compliments all around from everyone I gave the soup to.  I added a little curry powder to add some bite, which was needed.

I gave this out as x-mas presents and all were impressed with how it looked. I also made up a batch (it makes a lot) without ground beef, and it's pretty tasty.  Also freezes well.

Thought the recipe was great, my family really liked it!  I gave this away as teacher gifts for Christmas and as thank you gifts to close friends.  It was a little thick and I added some water.  Thanks for sharing the recipe

made this before deciding to give as gifts...
I used tomato sauce instead of paste and cut down on the tomatoes, but I think the original 28oz diced tomatoes would've been better.  Great recipe and presentation... I used the pasta sauce jars (as recommended by another reader) and a narrow measuring cup as containers. worked out perfect !

I made this soup this after noon and actually tried to use a quart sized jar (didn't pay attention to the instructions that state to use a 1 1/2 pint jar) Then, I just used that mix to make the soup. The soup is fabulous and would love to give as gifts but I've never seen a jar that size, anyone know where to purchase them?! Anyway, the soup is delicious!

Good, but too thick. I changed the recipe to tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes as others had suggested. Also my cooking time was longer then what was stated.
Looks great in the jar!
I gave these as Christmas gifts one year and everyone thought it was great tasting too.

Excellent tasting soup!! I would have given it  five stars for taste, but my "issue" was with assembly. One reader had suggested putting the bouillon granules in the Mason jar first (followed by the dried peas). This made sense (so that the granules wouldn't settle  down into the pea layer). However, when I made the soup I discovered the bouillon powder was rock solid and stuck to the bottom of the jar (I had to add some boiling water to dissolve and use it). I wouldn't think this would be any different had I followed the order of the layers as per the original recipe. Has anyone else experienced this? The bouillon seems to have absorbed moisture from the other ingredients. 

I made the recipe with the following adjustments: Decreased the bouillon to 1/4 cup; decreased the rice to 1/4 cup (although, next time I'm going to try the full 1/2 cup); increased the pasta to 3/4 cup (I couldn't find alphabet pasta so I used coloured  rotini); 14 oz can diced tomatoes; and a 14 oz can tomato sauce (instead of paste). I'm giving them as Christmas gifts so am looking forward to others' opinions.

I always prep 4 jars and keep them in the pantry for cold winter weeks. This is great for a warm lunch or dinner. We typically use ground turkey and season it with fresh garlic and onion. YUM!

I wanted to taste before gift giving. Very good, but I think additions like pablano or jalapeño peppers would be a good addition for extra flavor. Shredded cheese, a dollop  of sour cream or cream cheese make good toppers.

I’ve made this soup 3 times now.  Love the flavor, but the split peas never soften.  I’ll either have to start omitting them or precooking them.  Don’t care for crunchy split peas!

This is so delicious. It makes a lot of soup. If it is not going to beaten in one serving then I would cook the macaroni by itself. Add it cooked to bowl. Save what you don’t eat and keep separate. Freeze the rest of the soup in serving size containers. You can freeze macaroni separate too. Otherwise it will get mushy yuck. Great soup for a big family sit down.

We got this as a gift and made it.  Of course, not exactly like the recipe.  We used real garlic instead of the powder and 1 lb, browned and simmered stew meat instead of the ground beef.  Make sure the peas and lentils are done.  We rushed it and they were still a little "al dente".  However, the meal was still good enough to go look for the recipe to be able to make it again.  Next time, some garlic toast to go with it. (We do love us some garlic).

These are a nice presentation besides being very tasty. I left out the rice but added some dehydrated vegetables and used some yellow and some green lentils just to make more layers. Be sure to stress in the instructions to add the tomato toward the end of cooking. The lentils wont get soft otherwise. Tomato sauce is much better in it than tomato paste.

I halved the recipe but kept the same quantity of pearl barley. I left out the rice and used 1 x 14.5 ox can diced tomatoes (no salt added) and 1 x 8 oz can of tomato sauce in lieu of paste. I also used non sodium beef bouillon because many reviewers had said it tasted too salty. I will give this mix to friends as an Xmas gift, with a wooden spoon, a ladle and the can of tomatoes and tomato sauce. Heck, I may even throw in a loaf of bread and a nice soup bowl if I can afford it!

Half the ingredients I don't actually like personally, BUT having said that; all these flavors go very well together.  For what it is, its simple, quick and easy to make.  Best of all, my kids can make this without any hassle.

I got this a a gift and I made it. I have to admit, it was very bland. I almost dumped it. I decided to monkey around with it a bit before I did. I added 1 Tblsp salt, 2 Tblsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 Tblsp white wine vinegar and 2 tsp black pepper and simmered it for another 20 minutes. What a difference. I would definitely make it that way again.

Excellent.  It also copes well with substitutions and varying amounts.  On its own, it's always perfect, though.  I make this several times every winter.  It's my go-to recipe for soup for our occasional cold Florida days.

This soup smells great, but I used chicken bouillon and leftover turkey.  This is the same recipe for a soup mix I just bought to put in a gift basket and paid $4.00. I had all the ingredients on my shelf! Has anyone used freeze dried tomato powder (or other ingredients) to substitute the tomato sauce/paste? I'm going to make these as gifts as "just add water" meals and "dry" can them for longer shelf life.

Made it last year as gifts and was asked to make it again. Need to crunch the numbers for a smaller serving size though have some single family members with no storage space for left overs (dorm). I personally found it too salty, so I may decrease the bullion a little,  or find low sodium. I also added dehydrated carrots to my jars for extra colour.

This was fabulous!  I did take advice from others reviews and used less tomatoes, also used fresh garlic.  My only other advice is to boil the beans first as they don't cook as quickly as the other ingredients.

I made these for Christmas gifts this year and from the people who have actually made the soup so far I get great compliments. I made a jar for us and it was wonderful. I used chopped up turkey sausage links and it was so yummy!

This is a healthy, hearty soup.  I am considering using brown rice next time, and possibly whole wheat pasta.  We really enjoyed this soup.  I also made cannisters of it with my daycare kids for Christmas gifts.  They turned out fantastic!

I received this as a gift, and it was very tasty.  It really thickened up and made a nice hearty soup.  
Next time I'll use the basic soup recipe and add some vegetables (cabbage, carrot.)

I put this together this Christmas - I bought cute 1/2 quart jars from Old Time Pottery for $1.50; put the ingredients in the jar; wrapped it in Christmas - themed basket wrap with a pretty bow and a spoon (4 for $1) and gave it as gifts for teachers and neighbors.  They turned out really pretty - do so hope the soup is good; as I didn't try it.  But it really made a pretty gift.

This makes a pretty presentation for Christmas and is a nice alternative to sweet gifts.  My husband particularly loves the soup and we eat it year round.

I made this last Xmas for gifts, but used different beans for color.  It took forever to cook, tasted fine tho. After reading the reviews, I'll try it again using the right beans.  Thanks for the additional suggestions.

I made this as part of a "dinner basket" for a new mom.  I just used a pint jar, and left out the pasta.  (I put it in a clear plastic bag tied up with a pretty ribbon.)  The presentation was very pretty.  I aslo made it for my family - minus the ground beef.  Tasty!  My husband can't wait to have it with the meat!

Made this up to tuck in baskets this past Christmas and everyone seems to love it.  Need to make a batch for me!
