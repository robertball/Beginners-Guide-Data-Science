It was just ok nothing special. I let the chicken sit for an hour after I rubbed the spices into it so the flavor was good. But I think there is too much potato and not enough chicken. If I ever make it again which I doubt I will I'd double the chicken.

Interesting combo of flavors though a bit too subtle for us. I will probably make this again but will season the meat a bit more.

We made this recipe with leftover potatoes and chicken that were already cooked and left out the white wine (used some milk instead). It was very good with broccoli as the vegatable. :-)

It was all right. I added some chicken bullion that helped it a little bit.

This was just okay for me. Not as tasty as I thought it would be.

I wanted to give this 2.5 and gave it the benefit of the doubt. This sounded really good and it was a bit of a disappointment. Though I seem to have some different reasons than some other reviewers. I liked the chicken by itself and thought that had a good flavor. But I didn't like the sauce stuff at all. Fortunately adding the chicken in (with its good flavor) kind of helped diminish the sauce flavor so that overall it wasn't bad. But I won't be making it again.

The recipe might be okay as stated but any increase in servings throws off the balance of flavor and the wine becomes overpowering. I had to add cheddar cheese in order to cut down the strength of the alchohol. Will not make again.

Very good...I just substitute the half-and-half for heavy cream and instead of 3 tablespoons did 1/3 cup..Very good quick recipe!

I found this a little too bland -- so I sprinkled some dill weed on it and that made the dish!

I added curry to mine and tweaked the salt. I also added 1 cup of chicken broth with the wine. I served over rice. Loved it.
