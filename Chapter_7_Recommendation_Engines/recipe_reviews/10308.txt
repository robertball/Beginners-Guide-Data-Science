These are fantastic!  I've made them several times, and I find that I like them with extra oats (1/2 cup or so), less sugar, and with unsalted butter (I don't use shortening or margarine because they're scary).  I often add chocolate chips to some of them, as well.  For those who get flat cookies, there are three likely problems: a) your fat is too warm.  Your shortening/marg/butter should be almost chilled--just barely warm enough to be creamed with the sugar.  Anything warmer, and you're likely to spread. Also, don't cream them so long that the fat warms up;  b) warm baking sheets.  If you put dough onto a cookie sheet still warm from the last batch, you're asking for it. It's best if both the dough and the pan are cool; c) if neither of the above seems to be the problem, try adding another 1/4 cup of flour (or just make sure you were adding the proper amount in the first place).  Hope this helps.

Over analyzation and discussion is just not necessary with this recipe. It is, quite simply, a great recipe on its own merit and doesn't need any messing around with it. Generally I prefer all butter for my cookies, but sometimes, as with this cookie, the shortening/butter combo is for a reason-shortening for a little heft and crispiness, and butter for flavor.  This recipe is kind of like when you go to a hair stylist that's been doing your hair forever-you don't have to say a thing cuz she know's what you want, knows what she's doing, and she does it right.  Great recipe, great cookie. Like my hair stylist, the recipe knows what it's doing and does it right.

How could someone complain about this recipe?  I am not a cookie baker novice, and these cookies were just beautiful!!  I added some white chocolate chips.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  The oatmeal gave them a beautiful rugged texture, not to mention an awesome taste!  And I don't know why some say this is salty, I can't even taste the salt.  I have made another peanut butter oatmeal cookie from this sight which I thought was good until I tasted these.  This is my new PB recipe!!  I am taking these to a fellowship at church tonight.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is very good.  I doubled the recipe, and then added 2 extra cups of oats regular, not quick cooking).  I also added 2 tsps of Almond extract.  I also used crunchy peanut butter.  These are very easy to bake.  You know they are done when they look wrinkled.  Be careful not to move them off the cookie sheet before they cool or they will break apart.  But if one should crack, careful move it to the cooling rack and gently smoosh together.  When it completely cools the cookie will be "healed"  You can get a lot of cookies on a tray as the cookies do not spread much.  I got 27 on 16" pizza stone.  I use a small scoop so as to have uniform size cookies.  Oh and I used unbleached flour except for one cup, which I used whole wheat flour.  (Just a little bit of goodness in our goodies.)  We make many dozens of different types of cookies for xmas gifts.  With as chaotic as life can get with a large family, we only make drop cookies, and only those that look nice, taste delicious, and freeze well.  This recipe fit the bill!  The kids think chocolate chunks would make an excellent addition to this recipe.

Soooo Soft and Chewy!  This was a perfectly soft, not-overly sweet peanut butter cookie.  I don't like crunchy/ crisp peanut butter cookies, and this recipe gave me exactly what I was looking for.  Definitely add REAL BUTTER (salted) and I find adding 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chip enhances the cookie.  You can't really taste the oatmeal in this recipe, but since the batter comes out VERY soft, the oatmeal seems to help hold it together.  Refridgerate the batter in between baking and no more than 10 min. if you want your cookies to stay soft.  I find the amount of sugar perfect if you add chocolate chips and this stays fresh for days in an airtight container!  TRY IT- you WON'T REGRET IT!!

Very good!  I too increased the following ingredients:  PB 1 1/2 cups, oats 2 cups and added 1 tsp vanilla.  Terrific!  Then, for 1/2 the batter I put in 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips.  Those cookies were good, but it overpowered the PB and so just tasted like chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.

Very good cookies! We used 2 cups of oatmeal (the 1 cup it called for just didn't seem like enough).  Glad we did! Baking cookies are out of my element but these were easy and turned out tasty!

These are excellent peanut butter cookies!  I added about 1/2 cup more peanut butter and a dash of vanilla.  I also used chunky peanut butter and it added more crunchiness.  Next time I am going to try it with milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  I agree 1 cup of oatmeal is not enough.  I added an extra 1/2 cup but next time will increase it to 2 cups total.  This is a keeper!

Just wondering why people give recipes 5 stars and then alter the entire recipe how does one get 5 stars from that?  Thought these cookies were great and made them just as the recipe stated.

I'm not sure why so many people felt the need to make such big changes to this recipe but I decided to make the recipe as is, more or less, and I SURE am glad that I did!

 I've tried one or two flour-less peanut butter cookie recipes on this site that turned out to be a bust (Guess it just goes to show that you can't make a real cookie w/o flour) so I decided to try this one. 
The only VERY SMALL changes that I made was 1.}added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2.}substituted the margarine with unsalted butter. 

I'm not sure at all why some people said this cookie was crispy and crumbly. Mine turned out to be soft,crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and NOT at all cakey or puffy. I think the people who got crispy and crumbly over-baked theirs big time. You should take them out of the oven RIGHT when you see the edges start to brown. Even if the middle doesn't look quite done. It will set when cooled.(See my photos)

One last thing that I did change that probably did not alter the recipe other than taste, is I substituted half of the shortening for coconut oil (while still partly solidified) only because I'm trying to use as much coconut oil as I can in my diet. (one of the healthiest oils for you in the world!) On a positive note, the Extra Virgin CO added just the SLIGHTEST hint of a coconut flavor in the cookies. It might be what could make this recipe for some of you that claimed these cookies were missing something.

TRY THIS RECIPE. YUM YUM!

very disappointing!  I think if I would have used just Butter instead of the shortening and Butter; they would have tasted a lot better.  My children and husband didn't like them either; and said that there was an "aftertaste".
It also calls for too much sugar.

As is, this recipe makes a very serviceable cookie, if a bit too sweet for my taste so I've rated it four stars.  The second time I made these, however, I used unsalted butter in place of the margarine, 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 cups oats.  With these changes, it makes a five star cookie.  The butter gives a nice mouth-feel and crisp outer layer while the shortening provides a chewy center.  As other have said, it's wise to refrigerate the dough a bit before baking to cool off the fats.

A nice cookie that is a bit out of the ordinary. It's a peanut butter cookie with some texture from oatmeal.  I cut the salt in half and used chunky peanut butter.  I also added a cup of white chocolate chips per batch.  Teaspoon drops seemed kind of small, so I used a tablespoon.  Since some reviewers complained about the cookies spreading too much during baking, I formed the tablespoonfuls of dough and froze them.  Then I just baked them from a frozen state.  I doubled the recipe, so now I have a couple zipper bags of frozen dough balls ready for the next time I need to bake some goodies in a hurry!

My new favorite cookie!! I doubled the oats, added some vanilla and used all butter instead of shortening and margarine. The only problem is they don't last long around the  house.

I was looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe, because I have this big honkin' thing of peanut butter in my cabinet.  I just got done making these cookies and I'll tell you....they were pretty darn good.  I didn't have quick oats, so I used the old fashioned oats that I did have.  I did cut back just a smidge on the salt, because of what some of the reviews said about the cookies tasting salty.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and didn't add anything extra. My 3yr old helped me make them :)  They were easy to make.  They turned out pretty.  And they tasted great!  My son and I each had four!! Yikes!!  I really can't think of anything negative to say about them.  I really liked this cookie, and I really don't get too excited about peanut butter cookies.  If you are reading this, then you obviously are looking to make a PBC, so try this recipe.  I think you'll be pleased.  I was.  I was able to fit 15 small to average size cookies on an average sized cookie sheet(5 rows of 3).  I ended up with almost 6 dozen cookies.  Enjoy!  I hope this helped.

These make the BEST chocolate chip cookies. I tried about 10 cookie recipes from this site as I am always in search for the 'better' recipe. When I first made this, I didn't change a thing other than using butter for margarine(I kept the shortening as I wanted to see if it make a huge difference. I usually never use shortening) and added 1 cup of chocolate chips, and 2tsp of vanilla. They were the best cookies I have made and reminded me of the thin, chewy subway style cookies which I prefer to thicker cookies. After trying few other cookie recipes from the site which gave me mediocre cookies, I remembered the delicious cookies I've made once! So I went back and made again with these changes: Used all butter instead of short/marg combo(better taste but slight lesser texture), doubled the oats, added chocolate chips and vanilla. I baked 12min for first batch, 10min for second. 10min was definitely much better tasting and 12min was a bit dry and too crispy for my taste. Doubling the oats was a bit too much since it gave too much of the chewy oat texture, which my family preferred but I like softer cookies. Third time I baked, and my favourite result was this. ALL BUTTER, 2 TSP OF VANILLA, 1.5 CUPS OF OATS, 1 CUP OF SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS, KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE SAME, AND BAKE 10MIN. Some say salt is too much but I tell you it is not. If using slow-cooking oats, just let the dough sit in fridge couple of hours to soften them. They do get a bit flat but I prefer that anyways :)

The best texture - crispy/chewy.  I've been craving cookies for a while and these really hit the spot.  Here's my hint.  I ALWAYS double cookie recipes because I figure if you're going to go the trouble - make a BUNCH of cookies.  And, I ALWAYS use butter.  I mixed these up and scooped them onto parchment lined cookie sheets.  I put the first sheet in for 7 minutes.  I put the second sheet in under the first and bake for 7 minutes.  When the timer goes off, I take the first sheet out, move the second sheet up and put the third sheet in.  Seven minuets later, I do it again.  The last sheet bakes quicker than 7 minutes but if you like them really dark and crunchy leave them in.  Happy Cookies!

YUMMY! Made this with only 2 differences from the original recipe: I ran out of peanut butter and ended up using a few tablespoons of applesause instead to make sure it wasn't too dry, and I added about 1/2 cup more oatmeal. Baked them for 11 minutes and they were perfectly slightly crisp on the outside but tenderly soft inside!

Five Stars are not enough. These are heavenly. I added coconut to part of the dough and it was fantastic too! Both ways are so good you will pig out on these! At least, I sure did. These are almost too good.

I've been making these for several years now.  They're quick and reliable and yummy even several days after baking, if they last that long.  I always roll the dough up in waxed paper or plastic, chill for a few minutes and cut them off the roll instead of dropping by spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet.  This makes for nice uniform cookies.  The recipe itself is wonderful as it's written, so throw out your other PB oatmeal cookie recipes and go with this one.  You won't be sorry.

I only made one change to the recipe I added I tsp. vanilla extract. My Grandson can not have peanut butter so we use a peanut butter substitute. Called Wow it taste just like peanut butter, made from soy beans that he has no trouble with. We loved this recipe light fluffy cookies 10 min in the oven makes a light crunchie cookie that taste like nutter butter cookies, and 8 min a light softer one. cut like dog bones and the kids call em Scooby snacks. Thanks Michele.

Great recipe. The cookies are (and stay) nice and soft. I've made so many cookie recipes and I've found that a combination of butter and shortening works the best, like this recipe. The butter gives a great flavor and the shortening helps the cookie hold its shape. I was cleaning out my pantry and thought this would be a great base recipe to add some leftovers from Valentine's day. I added 1/2 bag M&Ms and 1/2 bag choc. chips. Everyone at my hubby's work loved the cookies (even though it was 2 weeks after Valentine's day)!

These cookies are AMAZING...after a few changes have been made. I used a little extra flour, as suggested by reviewers: 1 cup white flour and 3/4 cups of whole wheat. I used only 1/2 cup white sugar (and regular amt of brown sugar). I cut the shortening to 1/3 of a cup and also used 1/3 cup of butter - they would've been too greasy/flat otherwise. I added 1 tsp vanilla. I used 1/2 cup natural (health food store) peanut butter and 1/2 cup of skippy "natural" super chunk. DELICIOUS!

Perfect! Hurrrrah! I see quite a few people have mentioned their cookies turned out flat. I just pulled the most perfect cookies I've ever made out of the oven....fluffy as can be! I just used 1/4 c shortening and 3/4 c butter rather than the suggested 1/2 c of each and instead of using salt, just add another teaspoon of baking soda. You'll have giant mountainous cookies!

Perfectly soft and chewy.  I did add about a 1/3 cup more flour as the dough was a bit sticky with what the recipe called for.  I baked mine for 11 minutes.

Great recipe! Wish I had made these sooner. hehe I added cinnamon because years ago I tasted cinnamon in peanut butter cookies and have never gone back. :-)
I always make changes to recipes, and did add extra peanut butter and oatmeal, but the recipe is also fine the way it is.
I found I had to bake mine for around 15 mins or they were uncooked in the middle. This made them a bit crunchier as well, which is how I like them.
Thanks for the recipe!! :-)

These cookies are utterly delicious - weird how I've had plenty of oatmeal cookies and plenty of peanut butter, but never thought of combining them.  I used all butter in the recipe, added some vanilla and used whole wheat flour.  Perfect!

These were great! I added about 8oz of chocolate chips, and used butter instead of margarine and shortening. I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of the two called for. I also added about 1/4 c. more oatmeal.   I baked for 11 minutes and they were perfect.I took them to work and everyone raved about how great they were!
For those people who have said this is salty, make sure to use unsalted butter! Also, mine turned out beautiful, nice shape, thick and chewey, I don't know why others came out flat and ugly!

These are yummy cookies! Didn't do anything different from the recipe except to halve it, and I only got 15 cookies out of it. I did think the oatmeal taste was too subtle, but I would be hesitant to add more oatmeal without adjusting the liquid ingredients.

Great, dependable cookie that everyone likes.  I did make some small revisions each time I've made them (3 times in the last month).  I too amended making with 1 cup butter and omitting the shortening entirely.  I usually add one tsp. vanilla, as well. The oats makes it a stand-out from the usual PB cookie.  I also ran short on white sugar and used all brown one of the times I baked these with no noticeable change.

This cookie simply lacked flavor.  Not much flavor from the oats or peanut butter and there is no extract to add complexity.  Other than using all butter, I followed the recipe.  The texture and look of the cookie were both nice.

Very disappointing.  The cookies were pretty tasteless.  In fact, baking soda was the most prominent taste.  My children who are fans of about anything with sugar in it, did not ask for seconds.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! I baked them for my dad for father's day and he devoured them! I added an extra half cup of oats, a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract, and a half cup of yummy butterscotch chips- TO DIE FOR! Make sure to take them out of the oven promptly if you want them to be super soft and chewey! I took mine out at about 12-13 mins. Enjoy :)

I almost gave this recipe 3 stars (it would have been my first) because I was disappointed in how flat and thin my cookies turned out. I did enjoy the taste, however, and suspect that the flatness may be due to something I did. Does anyone have any ideas?

We enjoyed these very much. I added chocolate chips. You do need to let these cool for a while on the cookie sheet or they just fall apart.

These were wonderful cookies!!  I was looking for a traditional peanut butter cookie recipe (without the oatmeal) and couldn't find what I was looking for, but this recipe looked good and the reviews were fabulous, so I tried it.  I'm so glad I did - the oatmeal really added and the cookies stayed very chewy for a long time - perfect!!  :)

This recipe is bad, bad, bad.  Do yourself a favour and keep looking for an oatmeal peanut butter cookie recipe.  If you do make this recipe, unless you have the heart of a bull, severely reduce the salt.

This is a great recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I tweaked the recipe a bit, but it was fantastic! I used all butter, SugarLeaf (Stevia and cane sugar mix), fresh honey roasted peanut butter, and added Craisins and chocolate chips. I also did what others recommended and added an extra 1/2 cup of oats (I didn't have quick oats, so they were the "Old Fashioned" oats).  

The cookies turned out great; I did keep mine in for 15 minutes per pan and the result was slightly darker cookie than a "regular" peanut butter cookie but the edges were slightly crisp and the center was chewy. Not too peanut buttery, and not too oatmeal-ish. This is the perfect marriage of my two favorite cookies!

i was pretty unimpressed with this recipe as written. i think that the alterations/additions that other reviews have used (adding vanilla, chocolate chips, decreasing sugar, etc) would all make for a 4 or 5 star cookie, but as written these don't have very good flavor, and the texture is very "shortbread-y", and for a PB cookie i'm not sure how i feel about that.  i think there are much better PB cookie recipes out there that could be modified by adding oatmeal, instead of having to play around with this recipe to make it right.  thanks anyway!

These are perfect ,,, nice crust on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I had been looking for a thicker, more "cake-like" peanut butter cookie and this is it.

I did make two substitutions.  I used butter and regular oats, because that's all I had on hand.  In my oven they baked for exactly 14 minutes and did not fall flat.  They were perfect!!

Thanks!!

I made this recipe with one cup of unsalted butter instead of shortening/margarine (just didn't have any on hand).  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and increased the oatmeal to 2 cups.  The peanut butter/oatmeal alone is phenomenal, but adding the chocolate chips and walnuts made this cookie over the top!!  Very delicious and my family loved them.  I will definitely be saving this recipe and using it again and again!

Excellent! However, instead of using plain oats, I used cinnamon flavored instant oats. It made all the difference, and was delicious! :-)

My first two trays came out huge width-wise! So for the third tray, I did what Carist suggested. I put the dough in the freezer for a couple minutes after adding about 1/4C of flour. I used a cool pan (not the ones that just came out of the oven) and the cookies came out beautiful! I had also added 1tsp of vanilla which may have added to the spreading. Next time I'll cool the dough for a few minutes before putting on the trays.

These are delicious peanut butter cookies!  I add 1/2 cup more pbutter and and extra cup of oatmeal.  The oats give it a nice textured look, but doesn't dry it out at all.  Also, 1 txp of vanilla - I add vanilla to every cookie I make! Now the only 2 recipes I use is this one and the Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies on this site.  Two different types of cookies....just depends what Im in the mood for  :)

I made these exactly as is and they turned out perfect. I don't think I would change a thing. Nice peanut buttery flavor but not too dense, and the oats give it a different texture. Very good.

I made these in a 9x13 pan for bar cookies, only because I wanted to be lazy and not bake cookies today! Very good, the family loved them. In case anyone else wants to make bar cookies, just bake for about 25-30 minutes in a 9x13 in. pan.

These cookies are fantastic!!  I followed other users' advice and added 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of oatmeal.  I also used salted butter instead of margarine and used 1/2 the salt.  I rolled the dough into little balls and baked for 13 minutes.  They came out amazingly!  They were nicely browned and PERFECTLY round and uniform.  Everyone kept asking me how I got them so round and uniform.  Co-workers even asked if they were store-bought!  I will definitely make this recipe again!  Ten stars!

Absolutely excellent! The only things I woudl change would be the brown sugar amount which I added about 1/4 cup more and I added about the same amount more of peanut butter. Both my boyfrined and I felt it needed more peanut butter and we were right. It's simply excellent though. When sclumping the batter onto the cookie sheet it seems like it may not be stiff enough and feels like it might spread, but it doesn't! It puffs up just enough and stays moist. SO yummy. I added chocolate chips to the second half of the bathc and it rocked! Oh yeah, the batter tasted just like Reeses peanut butter, but w/ out the disgusting oil left over

Great Recipe!  I needed something to whip up quickly for coworkers as a Monday Morning treat.  I doubled the recipe and made a few adjustments.  For a double batch: I used 2 cups salted butter (because I hate shortening) and then I used 1 cup brown sugar and 4 cups white (because I didn’t have enough brown sugar).  

I baked for 13 mins and I definitely recommend you take them out before they start to brown too much, that makes the cookies super soft and chewy!  

The cookies were received with raves from my husband and coworkers, delicious!!

As I stood holding the teaspoon over the mixing bowl, I double- checked the recipe.  "A whole teaspoon of salt?" I thought, "well, 1546 positive reviews can't be wrong."  Well, apparently 1546 people like salty cookies.  If the recipe were good enough to tray again, I'd cut the salt in half.  But it's not peanut-butter-y enough for me to give it another go.  If you like your cookies with mild peanut butter flavor and lots of salt, this one's for you.

Delicious cookies! I'm a fan of peanut butter cookies, my friends and family often like oatmeal, so this was the best of both worlds. I Intended on using only salt free butter but I was short the full cup so I went ahead with the recipe and added butter flavoured shortening as well.. I also added about 1/4 cup more of peanut butter and used crunchy peanut butter for little chunks of peanuts throughout the cookie.

These turned out super dry so much so they just crumbled apart when touched. Even falling apart I was willing to give them a shot in the taste department but they just don't deliver.

You know it when you have something you made that turned out awesome and you don't want to share it with anyone? Yet you end you sharing it cause you want to show it off. Well, this is one of the recipes that you have to try. I used all the ingredients as listed. However, I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and used chunky peanut butter. I took a taste of it w/o the chips and it was pretty good in itself. But adding the chips stepped it up a notch. I cooked it till it was lightly golden brown and they came out beautifully. A little crisp around the edges and nice and soft on the inside. Will definately make again.

These are good and I feel less bad about eating them with the oatmeal in them. I added slightly more flour and oatmeal per other's suggestions because I wanted a more textured cookie, and I had no problem with them spreading too much, even using all butter instead of shortening/margarine mix. I was afraid they were going to be too sweet, but the saltiness of the peanut butter, the buttery flavor and the sweetness of the sugar seem to balance each another out. I only gave it 4 stars because I can't say it's the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good! Maybe next time I'll add some vanilla extract per another reviewer's suggestion and see how that adds to the recipe. Would definitely make again, especially since I seem to always have these ingredients in the house.

I didn't really care for these. I used all butter, added 2tsp of vanilla and I found them to be dry, especially the edges.. I also thought they lacked flavor in general. Mine also were "light brown" at only five minutes at 350 degrees so I had to turn my oven down in order for these to cook through and not be "over baked". Personally, I was dissapointed in this recipe, especially with such high reviews. However my 19 month old shoved the first cookie in his mouth the same way he does with brownies (he LOVES brownies) and when I turned my back he had actually ran into the kitchen and stole a cookie off the counter and got way too upset when I moved the cooling rack back far enough to where he couldn't reach anymore cookies. I gave these three stars because they will get eaten and apparently my son loves them but ill keep looking for a better recipe.

I didn't have butter and just used 1 cup of shortening and an extra dab of peanut butter!  They turned out extremely light and airy with a great crispy texture!  Wonderful recipe.

(I used a small icecream scoop to make the same sized balls and then flattened slightly with a fork).

Oh my gosh these cookies are GREAT ! I followed the recipe exactly with an addition of chocolate chips which I think put them right over the top. I will be adding these to my cookie list. I wish I hadn't given so many away. Oh well, I guess I'll have to make more....... :) YUM !

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I love baking cookies and was looking for a flavorful peanut butter cookie recipe..this had my two favorite ingredients, peanut butter and oatmeal but the flavor was blah.  You could not even distinguish if there was oatmeal in the cookie at all.  The actual cookie was fairly easy to make and had good form but that was it.  I had high hopes for this cookie but I don't think I will make it again.

These are so yummy! I followed the recipe almost! I subbed in 1/2 cup bran for 1/2 cup of flour, I added 1/4 mini choc chips, and 1/4 cup shredded coconut!  I thought they were going to be a heavy cookie but they are almost fluffy! Even the huuby liked them who doesn't eat sweets!

Not only do these taste great, but they come out picture perfect every time. My mother-in-law thinks I buy them from a bakery! :) The addition of oatmeal is nice, but this is more of a "peanut butter" cookie instead of an "oatmeal" cookie. My son, who despises anything with oats, really likes these. I add a tsp. of vanilla and shape the dough into balls. Be careful not to overbake - 10 minutes is perfect in my oven.  FYI: In an effort to make my baked goods a little healthier, I used 1/2 white whole wheat flour this last time I made these. Any attempts in the past to use wheat flour in my baking have not been well-received. You honestly couldn't tell the difference at all with this particular recipe. I'll try using all white whole wheat flour the next time.

Goodness...gracious....  I will have to make these at least a few times a year from now on, especially in the fall.  I don't mean to be the person who rates it after making a ton of changes, but this really worked for me, so...  I used a bit more oats (1 and 1/4 or 1/3 cup) and might use 1 and 1/2 next time. I also used reduced fat crunchy Jif peanut butter because that is what I had, but it turned out great.  I don't use margarine so I used butter.  I also added a tblsp of vanilla as others suggested.  I wasn't sure about using the shortening since I usually don't, but I'm glad I did.  I added milk chocolate chips and mini Reese's candy - yum...I definitely think using a mini candy like Reese's or M&Ms adds something.  I made some with just milk chocolate but they weren't as good.  I would try some with white chocolate chips next time as well.  Thanks for this amazing recipe, it's a keeper!!!

I think I have found my new favorite cookie recipe.  Yes, I made a few modifications, and while some thing doing so makes the rating invalid, I think cooking and baking is all about personalizing and sharing our successes with others.  So here's what I did:   I used margarine (would have used butter, but didn't have enough in the house), reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, perhaps had a bit more peanut butter (and I used  a reduced fat version), but no more than 1/4 cup more.  I also used 3 tsp baking soda, reduced the salt to about 1/2 tsp and doubled the oats (using regular, not quick).  I did throw in a couple tablespoonfuls of flour as it seemed too wet to me.  Oh, and the addition of a cup of chocolate chips was perfection.  I baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 13 minutes, let them sit for about 4 minutes before moving them to a rack, and they were perfect.   They didn't spread much and were nice and crisp on the outside while being chewy on the inside.  So good, and my kids loved them and didn't even realize that I used half whole wheat flour to pump up the nutrition just a bit.  :-)  Every little bit helps, right?

I altered a little bit, too, using butter instead of the shortening/margarine and increasing the oats and also using 3/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup all purpose flour...great cookies!

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1 t. vanilla (just b/c every cookie needs some vanilla!) and they were very good.  I recommend taking them out of the oven before they start to brown on the edges; that way you get a very chewy, yummy cookie instead of crispy.  For my oven, that was about 9 minutes.  They will firm up a little if you leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes, but don't try to take them off before they sit or they will fall apart.

These are quite possibly the best cookies I've ever had.  I mostly followed the recipe except I added an extra 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1.5 cups chocolate chips.  We can't imagine them any better. UPDATE: if your cookies are turning out flat, refrigerate the cookie dough before working with it and then refrigerate the cookie sheet with the cookies before putting the cookie sheet in the oven.  I do this with all cookie recipes and they always turn out great!

Yum!  These were some delicious cookies!  I used 1 C. butter instead of the margarine/shortening combo, and I subbed 100% wholewheat flour for the all-purpose flour.  I used natural peanut butter and regular (not quick-cooking) oats, and I added roughly a cup of chocolate chips.  I could eat these all day long - great recipe!

Followed some recommendations of other reviews and made the following changes:
1 c unsalted butter instead of shortening and margarine, 3/4 c brown sugar, 1.5 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla (all other measurements and ingredients the same). Cookies were excellent, good texture and taste.

These are beyond amazing cookies. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, an extra 1/2 c. of oats, and an extra 1/4 c. of flour. These are truly excellent cookies. Be sure not to overbake them. When they're just turning golden brown, take them out. Let them sit on the cookie sheet a minute or two before taking them to a cooling rack. This makes your cookies have light crisp edges and chewy centers. These would be great with peanut butter chips, too!

I honestly cant see how some people rate this at anything below a 5 star recipe. I am very picky about cookies and rarely find a recipe that i like. I must say that this is the best peanut butter cookie recipe i've ever had the pleasure of making. I followed the recipe exactly except that i increased the peanut butter/oats/baking power by half like some others have done. The result was fantastic! Thanks for this great recipe!

These are incredible! They are my new favorite peanut butter cookie! I love that they are soft and chewy on the inside and just a little crisp on the outside! I have made these several times now. Thank you for the great recipe.

Took many other's advice and used the butter flavored crisco, crunchy peanut butter, vanilla, less salt, and added peanut butter chips. Got raves with my in-laws. Great with a cup of coffee.

These cookies are a *6*! They become 'melt-in-your-mouth cookies' if you use 1 cup butter shortening instead of the 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup margarine. I didn't have quick-cooking oats so used the old fashioned - the texture was great. I also used 1/2 cup splenda instead of the white sugar. AND I put a Hershey's milk chocolate caramel kiss on top of each cookies as soon as I took it out of the oven.

I found these to be really good.  A nice balance of oatmeal and peanut butter.  I made a double batch and added one more egg to maintain moisture.  I think the trick to these cookies is cook until they just begin to brown and DO NOT take them off of the cookie sheet until they have cooled some and you are able to easily handle them.  This could take five minutes or so.  After they've cooled on the wire racks, they turn out great.  A little crispy on the edges and moise in the middle.  If you handle them too quickly they are guaranteed to fall apart.

I substituted unsalted butter for the margerine and shortening and they turned out great.  it made 48 perfect sized cookies.  Baked about 11 minutes.  They were chewy and everyone loved them.

BUTTER!!!! Don't use margarine if you can afford butter. I add 2 teaspoons of vanilla also. These cookies are perfection with the addition of chocolate chips or Hershey's Reese's premier baking pieces..chocolate filled with peanut butter creme (new product in 2005).   These are forever in my recipe file!! Thanks Michele

I thought these cookies lived up to the hype! They're delicious. I customized them by using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of shortening and margarine and then I added chocolate chips to half the batch and raisins to the other half.  I'd say they're more cake-like than chewy and not as chunky as other oatmeal cookies I have made.

I thought these tasted good. My only change was using all butter and making 1/2 recipe. I baked them on a parchment lined sheet and removed them from the oven at 14 minutes. I ate one warm, but found the edges sort of crispy. I hope the cookie does not get more crispy or crunchy as it cools. The main picture makes them look fluffy and soft, which is more of what I wanted. They do poof up a bit in the oven, but then flatted out a tad in the center when done baking. This will fulfill a peanut butter craving I am having, but Mrs Sigg peanut butter cookies are still my favorite from the site. I made 1/2 recipe and got 29 cookies using a cookie scoop. I would recommend this recipe for a simple lunch box cookie. Still, way less sweet than store bought cookies.

Absolutely delicious! Just the right blend of soft and moist with a little bit of crispiness. Over time, I made some minor tweaks because of allergies and ingredients on hand. I use all butter instead of shortening and margarine (my husband has a soy allergy). I add an extra 1/2 cup oats, and also cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp, since my peanut butter and butter have salt in them. They turn out fabulous every time, even when I make them gluten free with rice flour. I love peanut butter cookies and these are my favorite!

This is the PERFECT peanut butter cookie recipe!  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and shortening.  And I used crunchy peanut butter, added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, and increased the amount of oats by a 1/2 cup.  I also added a 10 oz. bag of Reece's peanut butter chips.  YUM!  Total peanut butter flavor in every bite!  I baked these for 12 minutes and they came out just browned on the bottom and soft through the middle.  This will be my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe from now on!

This recipe is good as it is. However, I have made a few changes to make the cookies a little healthier. I replaced the shortening with applesauce and cut out the white sugar all together. I also have added vanilla extract, upped the peanut butter, and added old-fashioned oats which makes them taste even better.

Fantastic!  And the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I felt it was necessary to make some modifications (so I  liked my cookies 5 star worthy but changed the recipe).  I don't like margarine/crisco so I used half butter and half coconut oil.  I added a little extra oatmeal and skimped a touch on the white sugar.  I also added vanilla so the coconut oil wouldn't be too intense. 

I baked for about 13 minutes (I used an ice cream scoop for consistent big sizing).


Unrelated to flavor, I used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat for nutrition.

These are really, really good!  I used Wow Butter (peanut butter substitute....so my son can take to school) and all unsalted butter in place of the shortening/margarine.  I reduced salt by half and added about an extra 1/4 cup of wow butter.  I usually like to try a recipe for the first time without substitues or changes but I usually dont have shortening on hand and I didn't want to risk them being too salty. Oh, and I also added an extra 1/2 cup of oats.  
Definately the best looking cookies I've ever made.  Not flat AT ALL!  I measured level tablespoons full and dropped on sheet.  They didn't spread too much so managed to put 3 rows of 5 on a 17 inch pan.  Using the level tablespoons, I got 70 cookies from this recipe!
Maybe if I stuck to original recipe, I may have given 5 stars.  The only negative I have is they are more crumbly than I would have liked but that's a negative because it means a mess when the kids eat 'em.  I will definately make again.
(I baked mine for 10 mins per tray....perfect.  JUST starting to brown.  I tried parchment paper for one "load" and i had to bake for an extra 2 mins.  They didn't brown like the others but were perfect)

AWESOME!.. I followed the recipe exactly, baking 10 minutes only; I used Quaker "regular" rolled oats instead of "quick cook" and they were fine.  These are the perfect balance of soft/chewy, sweet/salty!  :)  I used up some of our low budget peanut butter the kids said wasn't as good as Jiff and no one complained!

Husband immediately said these were a 5 star cookie! I am 6 months pregnant and was craving an oatmeal and a peanut butter cookie and these were PERFECT! I made exactly as directed and was not disappointed. Taste just like an oatmeal peanut butter cookie and I will definitely make them again!

Just finished making these cookies and I thought they were pleasant.  I did modify the recipe slightly by using all butter, 2/3 cup of each of the sugars and 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal not because I felt the recipe need tweeking but because of personal taste. Reducing the sugars made the cookies just perfect in sweetness. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Really yummy! I only gave 4 because it produces quite the flat cookie. I think more oats would have made it thicker/chewy. But I am a new baker so thanks for an easy recipe that's simple and tasty!

We love these cookies!!!  I did add an extra 1/2 cup regular oatmeal, used butter instead of margarine & added a tsp of vanilla.  Not too much PB, just enough oatmeal, great texture, crispy outside, chewy middle, & they look beautiful.  All in all a GREAT cookie.  We'll definitely be making these bad boys again!

A warning to all who make these - I have never seen cookies fall apart like this! Make them with a thick-bottomed pan and let them cool on a rack before you think about touching them. 

That said, they are very good. 12 minutes and they were done. At 15 they'd be burnt to a crisp!

These cookies came out thin, crunchy, and very uninspiring. I followed the recipe exactly, even though many reviewers suggested adding flour/oatmeal. Maybe that would have helped, I don't know, but as written, these didn't work for me at all.

Very delicious, didn't have any brown sugar so I used Zulka  Sugar, which has a mild molasses flavor. I also just used unsalted butter.  This is a definite keeper.

These were easy to Make and turned out good. My husbands work usually emails and call me to say thanks when I bake, and this tome I didn't hear from them, he said they were good but not "the best good". My first batch turned out a little flat so I added more oatmeal for my nextm batch and it really didn't make any difference.

Delicious!  I only changed the recipe by adding about 1/2 t vanilla.  The cookies do have a shortbread texture as another reviewer said but I don't consider that a bad thing.  These will be on my list to make again, soon!

Sister & daughter approved! Very attractive cookie.  They turned out so pretty and tasty.  I only baked them for 10 minutes but I prefer my cookies soft.  Also, I always bake with salted butter and I will omit the teaspoon of salt next time.  They have a milder peanut butter flavor than my usual recipe but this version has a heartier and saltier taste.  Definitely saved this recipe!

I used all salted butter (thus omitting the salt called for in the recipe), reduced the white sugar to half a cup, increased the peanut butter to two cups and added an extra half a cup of oats. I recommend starting with the 10 minutes of baking time and leaving them in longer if necessary (my first batch was fine, the second a little burned- both were set to bake for 15 minutes). I would probably use more oats next time since I did add twice as much peanut butter.

The flavour of these cookies were excellent, but they became hard within hours! :( and they were wayyyyyy too salty... it was all we could taste! Besides that, warmed up in the microwave the next day they were really good.

These were excellent and very easy to make.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats.  I also used salted butter in place of margarine, so I cut the salt down to half a teaspoon.  I'm always partial to vanilla in my cookies, so I added a splash of that in as well.  If you're looking for a very oatmeal taste to the cookies, I'd add an extra cup in.  I'd also recommend NOT using all butter/margarine in place of the shortening.  The shortening adds a very crisp flakiness to the cookies.  These are not soft cookies, so the shortening helps them to stay crisp instead of just biting into a hard cookie like the consistency of a Chips Ahoy cookie.    Stick to what I wrote above, and you won't be disappointed.

With some minor modifications, these cookies are great.  First, I used all unsalted butter in place of the shortening and margarine.  I cut the white sugar down to 1/3 cup. And finally, I used 3 cups of oatmeal to really get that oatmeal taste (at 1 cup, you don't really taste it). My husband and our friends really enjoyed these.

Made this exactly as the recipe said but as I have a fan oven turned the temp down by 10 degrees celcius as usual. I made half the recipe and still got 30 cookies using a teaspoon to measure the batter. I found that the cookies melted/flattened perfectly if just dropped from the spoon but needed to be flattened with a fork a little if the mixture had been into balls to make a more perfect shaped cookie. I found that the salt heightened the peanutty taste. I cooked mine for 11 mins and the cookies are both crisp on the edges and chewy on the centre. Yum and thank you!

This was soooo good- way better than store bought ones! I only used 1/3 brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar, and only 1 egg. Fantastic! My son usually does not eat peanut butter but he did like this. Thank you for this recipe!

me and my family really enjoyed these cookies.  I did add a little extra flour, pb and oats.  Still came out a little flat but not completely.  I used one stick of butter and one stick of marg. Good change of pace!

I liked these cookies a lot, I did add 1 cup mini semi sweet choc. chips to recipe. Next time I would add less salt. May 3/4 teaspoon or 1/2. Other then that they were great.
Update I didn't realize I had made these before so this time I used 1/2 mini choc chips. These cookies get BIG so make room on cookie sheet

I was looking for the best peanut butter cookie recipe, and I found it.  They turned out crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside.  I also only baked them for 8 minutes so they would stay soft, since cookies continue to bake on the pan when out of the oven.  This one is a keeper...no modifications on ingredients necessary.

This is my favorite cookie recipe on allrecipes.com.  I am not a chocolate fan (while everyone else in my family is).  I can make these and then my little kids stick m-n-m's on top before I throw them in the oven.  I have taken suggestions:  Add 1tsp Van., use 1 3/4 c. flour, use 2 c. oatmeal, 1c. chunky PB and 1/2 c. creamy.  They also taste incredible with white chocolate chips added.  I cook them with convection at 325 for 9 min. and they are perfect.  they look under cooked when I first take them out, but the firm up pretty quick on a cooling rack.

These cookies came out great! My only issue is that they are a little bit too "salty"...I'm assuming that's from the 2 teaspoons of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of salt. I do love the combination of salty and sweet, but the saltiness was just a tad overpowering. I'll make them again, and probably only use 1/2 tsp. of salt. Other than that, AWESOME cookies! Thanks for the recipe! :)

When you make drastic changes to a recipe then it's not the same recipe and you should post your own recipe with your changes. Don't ride the shirt tails of someone else good reviews with your recipe.

I just finished making these cookies and they are so good.  I used a bit more peanut butter, just to finish up what I had left and about 1/4 cups more oats. I also used unsalted butter, I never use margarine in my baking.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  They only took 10 minutes to cook.  Don't be tempted to overcook them.  You have to cool them completely on the cookie sheet because if you try and take them off before than, they break apart.  These are definitely going into my cookie rotation.

This is my favorite recipe website... but my beef is "PEOPLE NEED TO GIVE THE ORIGINAL A CHANCE!"  I see everyone changing this and that before they even try the REAL DEAL! So, this is one of those recipes that doesn't need "fixed" or "altered".  They are only chewy when warm, but they always taste great!

An amazing recipe! I added a tsp of pure vanilla extract and some cinnamon, and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups. It's especially delicious with a cup of raisins and cranberries.

This treat is indeed a twist to the normal peanut butter cookies. I increased peanut butter by 1/4 cup and used chunky one. I also increased oatmeal by 1 cup and used a combination of rolled and quick oats. To perk up the flavor, I added 1 tsp vanilla. Despite the changes that I made, this recipe is great by itself. Definitely keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  I actually halved the recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and modified just a little: used all butter, 1/4 cup more flour and 1/4 cup more oats and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  Will definitely make again.

These were quite nice after a few changes.     After reading several reviews,I used butter flavored shortening, added an extra 1/2 cup  peanut butter, as well as an extra 1/4 flour and an extra 1/2 cup oats.  Also, I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  A nice change to peanut butter cookies.  Next time, I will try choco-chips, nuts, etc.  This is a great recipe to experiment with!

We love peanut butter in my house, and this was a great drop cookie for us. I used 1 cup butter in place of the shortening and marg, crunchy instead of creamy and added 1 tsp. vanilla-- These were perfect after ten minutes in oven and 3-4 to rest/finish cooking out of oven. I highly recommend these!

These are "Wonderful". Melt in your mouth. Very "Light" in every way... Lighter then I was looking for as far as the oatmeal and thought the peanut-butter would be heavier but it turned out to be quite a 'Prefect blend'. I enjoyed the recipe so much I made a second batch and added in some chocolate chips. (1 cup) This will be a once a week must make in my home. Thanks much

This is a wonderful recipe! Just the right amount of sweet without being too sweet. I did follow the advice of previous reviewers using 1 C of butter, 1 3/4 C whole wheat flour, 2 C oats, 1 teas vanilla, and 1/2 teas salt. I also added 1/4 C flax seed, just to add a little health benefit!

I used all (unsalted) butter rather than shortening & margarine.  Based on other reviewers' advice, I added 1/2c peanut butter, 1c oats, and 1tsp vanilla.  I tried a half-batch for 10mins, but we like them better baked for 15mins.  Very nice cookie, Michele.  Thank you!

Good but I made some changes. Added vanilla 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. i also used natural chunky pb. Also added 1 3/4 cup of oatmeal but I think next time I will use 1 1/2 cup. I am still looking for a chewier PB cookie but overall very good!

This recipe as given is way too salty. But....this is a good basic recipe and even too salty the kids still liked them and when I made a second batch with 1/2 tsp of salt and one tsp of baking soda, they adored them. It has become a favorite of mine because the recipe is very forgiving if you goof up and easy to tweak to your tastes.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times, and since I am about to make them again, I thought I would finally review it. To me these are the best cookies my huband and I have ever tasted. These are my go to special treat cookies that dissapear faster than you can even say cookie. I also use butter instead of shortening, and I usually double the oats, just because we like a lot of oats. This is a PERMANENT addition to my personal recipe collection!

The taste is great! I would decrease the amt of baking soda slightly as I can really taste it in the cookie.  Great cookie for somebody who doesn't like too much peanut butter taste. I cooked some on the Silpat and others on the Air Bake cookie sheet. I thought the ones on the air cookie sheet tasted better, cooked more evenly and had a nicer color.

AWESOME!!! These were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had. I had to make two batches this weekend because the first batch disappeared in one day. I made a few changes. I used 1 cup of butter rather than the shortening & margarine,I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and I decided not to use the salt. I baked them for 10 minutes.

Very tasty. I'd use a bit more oats so they don't cook so thin. I added vanilla chips and used chunky peanut butter. I like to add the end of a loaf of bread in the storage container to keep them soft and chewy. Will make again!

I'm rating this recipe a 4 because I thought it tasted great BUT I'm not sure that it tasted much different than any other peanut butter cookie recipe that I have ever made. It was very quick to whip up though. Here are the minor changes that I made to the recipe: I used butter flavored shortening, 1 stick of unsalted butter instead of the margarine, used Jif extra crunchy peanut butter, added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and I added an extra 1/4 cup of quick cooking oats. I probably could have added more oats but didn't want to go crazy since I was using the crunchy peanut butter. I also froze the dough for about 30 minutes prior to baking. (I'm not sure I really needed to freeze the dough but it was a very hot day out and my kitchen was getting quite warm.) My cooking time was between approx. 9 and 11 minutes. I thought the cookies came out with the perfect texture with the oats and the nuts from the peanut butter. They were slightly crisp while still slightly chewy and perfectly delicious!

This cookie is delicious!  No wonder it got so many great reviews!  The few who complained about this recipe must have done something wrong because this cookie came out perfect for me on my first time!

I used Jiff LOW FAT peanut butter, and I used 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 butter.  I also added vanilla and a little extra baking soda. I always use bread flour for my cookies.

I used a cookie dough scooper (from Walmart) and dropped them in balls (don't press them down) and baked them for exactly 11 minutes.  They appeared "too soft" in the center, but just let them sit on the hot cookie sheet for 2 or 3 minutes and they continue to cook...then they are soft and chewy on the inside and crispy-tender on the outside.

Thank you for this recipe...it is delicious!!!

These are awesome!  I cut both sugars in half and added 3/4 cup chocolate chips (I know my audience).  I also used chunky peanut butter since it's what we had.  Oh yeah - used butter, not margarine.  I used a 2-tablespoon scoop and they baked perfectly in 11 minutes.  They are delicious and  beautiful, and will definitely be made frequently.

FABULOUS everything about these cookies is absolutely delicious....the dough, the cookie....mmm!  I used natural peanut butter and substituted a half cup of all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  Also i added a handful of chocolate chips to half the dough.  Both kinds are SO delicious i will definitely be making this recipe again and again and I don't usually like peanut butter cookies!  10 min was the perfect cooking time for me, brown, but not burnt and not undercooked at all.  Watch the cookies they do burn easily.  I highly recommend these!

These were awesome. I used 1 cup of unsalted butter, natural peanut butter and fine sea salt instead of regular salt. Added chocolate chips to half of the batter, turned out great. Be careful baking though, mine were done in 10 min.

I don't know what everyone is raving about.  I followed the recipe exactly and just like another reviewer, these came out greasy, salty, and not sweet enough.  I thought I made a mistake somewhere, so I made them again.  Maybe this cookie just isn't for me.  Funny thing is, I thought the batter tasted great.

An excellent cookie.  I used all Country Crock instead of shortening, which I tend to avoid, and cooked a test batch.  They turned out golden brown, crisp around the edges and chewy the rest of the way with a definite peanut butter taste.  They were thin, but Country Crock has more water in it than regular butter, so this was to be expeted.  I really didn't taste the oatmeal at all.  After cooking one sheet, I did add 1/2 more oatmeal but it did not make any discernible difference in appearance or taste.  All in all it's a great tasting cookie by itself but one that would also adapt well to other additions.

This cookies turned out wonderful! My husband loves them.  I didn't have any oatmeal so I omitted it.  I added 1/4 cup of flour and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon and used 3/4 a cup of crunchy peanut butter and 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter. I didn't flatten the cookies at all either I just dropped the dough by the teaspoonful onto the cookie sheet. Very good tasting and excellent texture.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these cookies for Christmas and everyone enjoyed them.  I used a wet fork to make criss-cross marks on the cookies and flatten them a little.  They turned out really well that way.  Very good!

A good easy recipe.  I always reduce the fat content by adding a few tbs less shorting and marg. and they always taste the same.  I also added some vanilla (about 1/2 teas.).

Didn't like it...they were too thin and crunchy.  Not terrible, just not as great as the rating (in my opinion).  Not a show stopper.

i thought these were OK. Mince turned out thin (i used a scooper too). They didnt have much flavor to them, i thought. Also, dont bake too long! they do cook fast (8-9 mins). I will keep looking for a great PB cookie.

I only changed the creamy peanut butter to chunky.  By far the easiest and BEST peanut butter cookie ever!  I baked them in a convection oven for 9 minutes.  They were just the right amount of crispiness!  I easily could have eaten the entire batch.

Super easy and really delicious. I threw in an extra handful (maybe 1/4-1/3 cup?) of oats and a 1/2 cup each of butterscotch and chocolate chips. Peanut butter, chocolate,  and butterscotch are a magical threesome

Perfect recipe, as-is. Best-tasting, peanut butter cookies. If you enjoy crispy, crumbly, buttery cookies with lots of PB flavor this is it (center still stays soft and chewy).  

Adding a little more oatmeal (heaping amounts) and baking slighty longer, made them crumblier and crispier, which I like. :)  It does not resemble an oatmeal cookie, even though tons of oatmeal -- no worries!  Rather than being chewy like oatmeal cookies, these have the above-described crumbly texture that's so good (probably due to the shortening and PB combo).

If they did not puff up and looked flat for you, it's because your ingredients are too warm.  Everything should be cold or slightly under room temperature, even your baking pan.  Don't re-use your baking pan while it's still hot to make a 2nd batch, which is why us bakers need at least 2 baking pans. :)

These were easy to throw together and they tasted great. The texture was not too crispy and not too soft. The only change I made was cutting the salt in half. My doctor has told me to do so to reduce my sodium intake. It definitely didn't hurt the cookies!

I'm making these right now, doubled the recipe and am baking the 6th dozen.  These are awesome, delicious, light, crispy and chewy!  Going to be my traditional Christmas cookies from now on!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use almond butter instead of the peanut butter because that's what I had on hand.  Love these!!

So chewy and delicious. I used a cup of unsalted butter in replace of margarine and shortening and added about 1/4 cup more oats to prevent them from spreading. They turned out wonderful!

I would give this 3.5 stars. Maybe because I had higher expectations based on the high reviews. I followed the recipe as written. I think they taste alright except there is too much baking soda which makes the cookies have a salty/baking soda taste. I also think there aren't enough oats in this recipe. If I were to make this again, I'd experiment with increasing the oats, decreasing the baking soda, and using butter instead of shortening.

I made these once and my husband loved them so much I have to make them once a week for him to take to work. Sunday is my cookie baking day now. Between these and Beth's Spicy Oatmeal cookies, his work buddies think I'm the Cookie Master. The only change I make is substituting butter for the margarine. Great recipe!

YUM! Just finished making this recipe. I did add 1 extra cup of oats. I baked the dough in a lined 9"x13" pan for about 19 minutes. Cooled and cut into squares. Turned out wonderful. I will make this again for friends who are peanut butter lovers. I might melt chocolate and glaze the top of the bars next time. Thanks for sharing!!!

Delicious! Didn't change the recipe very much. I added a bit more oats and a bit less sugar.  Will definitely make again.

I just made these for the first time (still in the process actually). The only change to the recipe that I made was to use 1 cup of salted butter in place of the shortening, margarine, and salt - because that's all I had. 
These cookies are perfect. They're not annoyingly sweet and the mix of PB and oatmeal is very good with a perfect ratio. I have been using a tablespoon to measure them out and I should end up with 60 or 72 at least, definitely not small cookies. I actually made these because I was craving junk food (chocolate, candy, whatever). These cured the craving but didn't leave me feeling gross and over-sugared.

This is a review from my 6 1/2 year old daughter.  "I LOVED THE COOKIES!   I could just kiss them they were so good!  They were great!  They were the best my family has ever had!"   
We used butter instead of the shortening and margarine and kept the batter cold as recommended by another reviewer.

These cookies are amazing!  I made some minor adjustments by adding about 1/4cup extra peanut butter as I just wanted to use up what was left.  Because of that, I added 1/4 cup extra flour.  I also added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips, since I had them on hand and figured why not!  I made them nice and big, using an ice cream scoop and baked for 18-20 minutes.  I have been looking for a kick butt peanut butter cookie recipe and this one is definitely it!  Thank you

I just made these cookies and my house smells like a bakery! I followed the recipe exactly as written then added some choco chips for the last pan of twelve. Moist, delicious and most assuredly gone by nightfall. I just hate it when I see all the ingredients that I have in my cupboard then read reviewers who substitute everything but the kitchen sink. I want sugar, not applesauce! This recipe will be used again and again.

Very good cookies, and I like that you don't have to smash them.  I only had 1/4 shortening so I subbed 1/4 corn oil.  Turned out fine.  Note: Using my BH&G cookie scoop, I got 5 1/2 dozen cookies.

Ok, the first time I made these, I made them as stated, the second time, I used only butter instead of shortening and added chocolate chips. They are amazing that way and these cookies are always requested when we go to a get together.

Great recipe!  I substituted both the shortening and margarine for chilled butter (as recommended) and other than that modification, followed the recipe as shown.  When I dropped the spoonfuls, I didn't flatten them at all and they turned out quite well.  Made exactly 4 dozen.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used all butter, substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for white, and added 1 c. oats (for 2 total).  Then I added chocolate chips to half the dough.  Both ways turned out great.  This makes a nice, light peanut butter cookie, instead of the heavy, dense ones you usually get.

Good cookie.  Made it as directed.  However, I think the Outrageous Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe posted by Joan is better.  If you make that recipe without the chocolate chips, it's a peanut butter oatmeal cookie.

PERFECTO!
I followed other bakers' recommendations. I added 1-1/2 cup oats, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1-3/4 flour, chocolate chips, and used 1 stick unsalted butter and 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter. I didn't change the butter/shortening ingredients because it is working for others. I thought why change that if it works? 
Results - HEAVEN! My 4 kids and hubby devoured them. My hubby is not an oat person and he couldn't taste the difference. Thank you!

These are awesome cookies as written. Made them as directed the first time. Second time I added 1/2 cup more of oats and 1 tsp vanilla. Always use parchment lined cookie sheets.  These are going to the top of my favorite cookie list! Thanks Michele

I wanted something sweet after dinner tonight, so I made my favorite chocolate chip cookies. After I was done mixing them up I decided to mix up another batch of cookies. I looked up peanut butter cookie recipes and decided on this one. The cookies were really good! I did add 1t. of vanilla and omitted the salt. (Peanut butter has salt in it and I don't like salty cookies). Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe as written and won rave reviews here. Has a nicer texture than the usual peanut butter cookie.  Next time I'll try butter and maybe add peanut butter chips.

I really like these.  They are the first hard cookie I've ever liked because they still have a nice lightness to them.  My cookie eating roommate loves them so much he killed off three quarters of them in 2 days.

These are pretty good, the dough was very soft and I didn't know how that was going to work out but the cookies came out fine, a nice texture to them. I only made one change initially - I added 1/2c oats for a total of 1-1/2c as many commented on and even with that it was hard to tell there were oats in these cookies! and the peanutbutter flavor was very mild. After the first batch baked DH & I thought they were very bland so I added mini chocolate chips to the rest of the batter and that really helped them to be more interesting :)

This recipe is phenomenal! I baked these and my husband even ate them. It's unusual for those that are not from the U.S. to enjoy peanut butter, but he didn't stop eating them!I'm bringing them for the Thansgiving potluck here in Korea!

I doubled the oatmeal, used salted butter in place of the shortening and margarine, and left out the salt. After the first batch, I had to add another cup of flour because the batter wasn't thick enough for proper cookies.

These were by far the sweetest cookies I've ever made. I like sweet things, but I couldn't eat more than half a cookie at a time.

I won't be making them in the future.

These are absolutely delicious and a great, great, GREAT recipe to make butter-less and extra healthy for the husband and kiddos.  Instead of any shortening/margarine/butter, I used 1 cup applesauce and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup (the applesauce is sweet, that's why you can cut down the sugar).  I also used whole wheat flour and natural peanut butter.  Very delicious - your husband (and kids!) may never thank you for helping him/them keep a slimmer waistline, but deep down, you'll know you've done your job!! :)

These made a great peanut butter cookie but I felt it was lacking in oatmeal flavor even after toasting my oats. I got the texture from the oatmeal but that was about it. Don't get me wrong, I will be making this recipe again and again when making peanutbutter cookies but I'll be playing around with the amount of oatmeal to get the right flavor combo I'm looking for

What an awsome cookie, shape and chewy.  I would change one thing though, I would omit the salt all together.  I found them too salty even with the 3 c. of sugar.  First of all the peanut butter is salty, and than with the 2 t. of baking soda, thats salty too.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  LOVE the cookie though.  Make it everyone, and put it in your recipe box.

the only thing that would have made these any better would have been butter instead of shortening for flavor. Otherwise, great cookie.

They were too plain and the textures was not good at all. After the first batch I added some walnuts, cranberries and chocolate chips to dress them up.

I made it as written, which is as it should be for a first time review, but I meant to add vanilla but just forgot.  My shortening was butter flavor.  My scoop was probably larger than a teaspoon so they took more than 15 minutes but I lost track of exactly how many minutes.  But the scoop made for a perfectly round cookie.  I do detect a bit of salt.  That could be from my ingredients like the margarine or the peanut butter.  I used honey roasted peter pan.  Overall it is a good little cookie.  Next time I would probably add more oatmeal but you certainly could save all the extra ingredients for another recipe.

As a fan of both oatmeal and pb cookies I had high hopes for this recipe.  Unfortunately, the end result didn't wow me.  As-written they were middle of the road, crumbly, peanut butter cookies.  Perhaps increasing the amount of oats would have given them a more fulfilling texture?

Yummy!  I made these exactly like the recipe and they turned out perfect - just the right combination of crumbly and moist.  I got about 36 cookies, so I guess I made them a little bit larger than some. Thanks for sharing!

My family and friends loved these cookies.  I will add more oats next time and I used real butter for the shortening portion as I like a buttery taste.  I will try next time with half whole wheat flour to make them healthier.  This one's a keeper!

I knew these were going to be good when I couldn't stop eating the raw dough! ;0
Here's the changes I made per previous reviews:  used a combination of I can't believe it's not butter and smart balance, added 1/4 cup more flour, added 1/2 cup more oats (part old fashioned b/c I ran out of quick oats), I used Naturally Made Flax Seed butter b/c that's what I had and added probably 1/2 cup more, I only used 1/2 tsp salt and added 1tsp vanilla. 
Cooked about 12min and were perfect w crisp edges and chewy middles.  I'm not a big fan of PB cookies but my husband loves them so that's why I made them but I couldn't stop myself from eating them!!  Would probably be even better with chocolate chips!

I made these with butter instead of margarine/shortening. They were nice and soft, even the next day. The flavour was good but these definitely aren't my favourite peanut butter cookies. Even with the addition of chocolate chips to half the batter, they were still so-so. My toddler really likes the cookies though and I like that the oats add some extra nutrition to the cookies.

I adore these cookies! I am an absolutely terrible baker, but these always manage to come out fantastic. I didn't change a thing to the recipe! Ocassionally I add cinnamon or honey or maple syrup to the mix to change it up.

Omit the shortening & margarine and use 1 c. butter.  I added about 1/4 c. extra flour and chocolate chips!  I love the oatmeal in it!

PEANUT ALLERGY.  
ok my neighbor is allergic to peanuts, so i used cashew butter instead.  OMG!!  she is sleeping now so i can't give them to her until tomorrow and i have got to get these out of the house before i eat them all.  wow, YUMMY!  i did add a teaspoon of vanilla, used butter and veg oil and subbed 1/2 cup of flour for almond meal.  i also added a pinch of cayenne pepper, because that's what i do.  absolutely the best i have ever made and taste just like peanut butter cookies.

So yummy! I used unsalted butter, and added just a little more salt. I added some cinnamon and chocolate chips, and it was just great. 10 minutes was a perfect time.

I found them rather dull, and the texture was powdery. Thinking I made a mistake, I tried again, and the results were the same, even experimenting with shorter and longer baking times. Not sure why I'm getting poor results with this recipe.

I added an extra 1/4 cup flour and an extra 1/4 cup oats.  When they were done I pushed a mini kiss into the top.  They smell just like my favourite pirate cookies in the grocery store.

I followed the basic recipe exactly and added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup cocoa powder. Tastes like a peanut butter cup! Be sure to remove them from the oven before they look done and cool them for a couple of minutes before you take them off the pan.

These cookies are peanut-buttery and I really like the texture! I made the recipe with the modifications suggested by LadyBugOnTheGo and used unsalted butter rather than margarine and used crunchy PB. They are slightly crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside as others have said. They are neither bland nor too sweet. Just right. Ovens vary so I’d start with 9 minutes and work your way up. If you scoop too much batter then it will take longer to cook. I got 50 cookies, right around the yield. Mine cooked perfectly in 10 minutes then I let stand for a minute or two before removing to the wire rack. My husband is picky about his food and he called these cookies “outstanding.” The veteran bakers will laugh at me but I knew I'd be too lazy to clean my cookie sheets so I put parchment paper down and found that baking on parchment paper prevents burned bottoms. I didn’t know that! LOL.

I used 5 tbsp. of extra virgin olive oil and 5 tbsp. of canola oil as a substitute for the butter and shortening. I also took out the 3/4 cup of white sugar and bakings soda. It came out pretty great, but was still way too sweet. Next time I make it, I'll reduce it to 1/2 cup of brown sugar. (It could just be my lack of a sweet-tooth.)

I tried these cookies with only some minor alterations.  I used butter instead of shortening and made sure the amount of oats and flour were heaping cups.  They turned out absolutely gorgeous and tasted even better.  I highly recommend these!

Definitely a five star recipe that I'm sure is great as is, however I can't bare to use shortening or refined sugar so I subbed butter for the shortening and sucanat for the sugar. Everything else stayed the same. I did not need extra flour. I just used cold butter and my cookies were nice and thick. I under baked them a tad and they had nice chewy centers.

Tasty PB sugary goodness. Not overly sweet, and you could easy add some kind of chocolate deliciousness if so desired.    I used all butter instead of shortening, and they turned out quite yummy. 10 minutes was perfect for gooey, and 11 for crunchy.

Really incredible recipe. It was light and chewy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside... perfectly round and delicious. Will definitely go in my list of favorite cookie recipes.  Note: I used an ice cream scoop to measure out, and baked at 350 for 13 minutes (took them out when they were slightly underdone) and let them cool on the pan -- finished baking them perfectly!

Really addicting cookies. Not super sweet and not overly peanut buttery - Just right! I used cane sugar instead of white sugar to make them healthier. I easily gobbled up 6 in one sitting.

Holy Peanut Buttery Perfection!  These cookies are so good - perfect as written.  I used an ice cream scoop, so they were a little larger than suggested (I got about 3 dozen 2.5-inch cookies)and baked mine for 12 minutes.  These are very rich so a glass of milk is recommened!

DELICIOUS!  I used all butter and added an extra cup of oats.  I didn't find them to be too salty with the entire teaspoon of salt.  I liked that it made them taste even more peanut buttery. Mine didn't spread very much (without chilling the dough), and tasted better after they had sat a while.  IMHO they are best frozen!

WOW!! I'm writing this review after I just scarfed down 3 of these! They are addicting! I didn't change a thing to the recipe, and they turned out perfect. The only thing I did different is let the batter sit in the fridge for awhile so they wouldn't turn flat on me in the oven, which worked perfectly. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I did not change anything in this recipe and it is perfect.  I chill the cookie dough in the frig and then carefully roll into balls put on a tray on wax paper, gently push the balls down with a fork, freeze and then put the frozen cookies in a freezer bag.  I put the frozen cookie dough in my toaster oven on 325 and they come out perfect.  The first time I made these I cooked the whole batch and ate most of them myself.  I will not make that mistake again.  I love love love these cookies.

These were perfect!  I made them to take on a girls weekend trip.  I wanted oatmeal cookies and my friend wanted peanut butter so this was the perfect compromise.  I didn't flatten them and they baked round and chewy.  Even after a few days there were soft.

These cookies were wonderful! I made them with my daughter and we really liked how easy they were to whip up. They were a little chewy, super peanut buttery. Definitely the best peanut butter cookies I've had in a long time. Will make these again for my family!

This recipe is awesome!  I couldn't decide if I wanted chocolate chip cookies or peanut butter cookies, so I tried this.  I cut down sugar to 3/4 c. brown and 1/2 c. white and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 3/4 cup chocolate chips.  Even my husband, who is not a peanut butter cookie fan, loved them!

These are INCREDIBLE!  I made a few small changes--used coconut oil and butter instead of shortening and margarine; doubled the oats; and added 1 tsp. each of vanilla and cinnamon.  The best of oatmeal cookies and peanut butter cookies in one  =)  An INSTANT favorite!

I had a few jars of left over peanut butter in the fridge so thought I'd try making cookies. I used half this recipe, but with all butter and all golden yellow sugar instead and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon allspice. I automatically greased the pans with margarine but that did not seem to matter. I baked in a 325 oven on convection bake for 15 minutes.  Since I don't know how to tell if a cookie is cooked I thought they were too soft after that time so put them back in, turned the heat up to 350 and waited till the oven reheated (about 3-4 minutes) then took them out. This recipe must be foolproof because they seemed perfect, slid right off the sheets, cooled crispy and tasted great ... plus they are maintaining their crispness even tucked away in their tin. Can anyone give me a hint as to tell when a cookie is cooked though?

These have been my husband's favorite cookie since the first time I made them, and he isn't even a fan of baked goods!  I make a batch, roll them into balls and freeze them so I can make a few at a time for his lunches.  I freeze them on a pan lined with wax paper, then once they are set I put them all in a large ziploc bag.  GREAT cookies!

Quite yummy cookies.  This recipe makes a ton of cookies: I've already made 60 and there's still dough left for another tray of 12-15 (and I don't make tiny cookies!).  Twelve minutes seemed to bake just right for me.  Other than using all butter, I didn't change anything and they came out very nicely.  This will definitely be my peanut butter cookie recipe  from now on.

They turned out just fine, although I wish I had used crunch peanut butter instead of creamy.  Next time!

These are absolutely wonderful. My daughter is allergic to nuts and eggs so I used soybutter in place of peanutbutter and egg-replacer instead of egg. They turned out wonderful and is my daughter's fav. cookie!

Excellent cookies. My MIL told me about 5 times that they were so delicious. My husband commented that they were a little greasy, which is true, but that didn't stop us from devouring them. I didn't rate them 5 stars because I think more oatmeal is needed. And maybe the extra oatmeal would cut the grease down a little...? I'll probably increase to 2 cups of oatmeal next time!

UPDATE 9/22/09 Made these a second time.  They are so amazing!  The only thing changed was using butter and use honey peanut butter.  This is a great recipe!  Will keep using!  ORIGINAL 7/31/09: Wow! The taste is amazing!  The two things we changed was using Land O' Lakes butter with olive oil instead of the margarine and Peter Pan honey peanut butter instead of regular.  Our cookies were big, but still came out very yummy!  This has a very good peanut butter taste.  This is a keeper!  Thank you.

We really enjoyed these cookies, they were easy to make I did just use margarine as I do not usually have shortening on hand and only 1/2 cup while sugar and added about another 1/4 cup of flour this is the level of sweetness that is good for us and it did not spread as others  had problems with.

I just made these cookies and they were awesome! I did make some alterations, just to make them a little healthier. I used 1 cup white flour, 3/4 c ww flour, substituted honey for the white sugar, used 1 1/2 c of all natural peanut butter, and only 1/2 c of margarine.I also added a 1/4 c of ground flax. My 2 yr old absolutely loves them.  Delicious!

Awesome!!! One of the best cookies I have ever make. I used unsalted butter, add 1 cup of oats and a small bag of c. chips. The texture was perfect.

The only change I made was to add slightly more flour (1/4 cup) and slightly more oatmeal.  They were amazing.  I used unsalted butter and added a cup of chocolate chips.  I used my cookie scoop and made 5 1/2 dozen of VERY good cookies, thanks!!!

This is a great recipe, why did I never thing to add oatmeal to PB cookies.  I doubled the oats, it keeps them from spreading out so much.  Other than that I followed exactly.  My tip and one i read from another review for a different recipe is to put a piece of bread in with the stored cookies.  It keeps them from getting crumbly and they stay super soft.

Just took them out of the oven. Exactly what I was looking for, soft, chewy, peanut buttery, with a bit of oats. So so good. I used butter instead of the marg/shortening combo, and a bit more peanut butter and oats than called for. So amazing, perfect with an ice cold glass of soymilk.

I made these for my birthday because I'm more of a share than recieve kind of person. I used vegan ingredients so all of my friends could enjoy them - and they still turned out wonderfully. They were crunchy, chewy, and melt-in-your-mouth good. I highly recommend this.

Fabulous cookie!  I took others suggestions and used 1 cup of butter rather than any shortening, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and increased peanut butter to 1-1/2 cups.  I also refrigerated the dough for an hour, lets the flavors set in and easier to work with.  Lightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, wonderful flavor and texture!

Following others' advice, I added one teaspoon of vanilla, increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup, and increased the oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups.  Also, I used only butter and baked for ten minutes.  The cookies turned out soft and delicious.  The only change I would make next time is to omit the salt (because I used salted butter).  But overall, a very simple recipe that produces addictive cookies!

These cookies were amazing, but I did make a lot of changes to them. I used 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of raw blue agave syrup, used 1 cup of Kraft smooth PB, and 1/2 cup of natural PB. I used 1 1/2 cups of old fashioned oats, 1 cup of all-purpose  flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat, and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Altogether, they turned out to be amazing cookies, and bit healthier than the original as well! They got even softer in the days after, which we all thought was great.

Wow, oatmeal works wonders for cookies! If you are having trouble with your cookies spreading too much, add half the amount of baking soda and and replace the other half with baking powder- this worked really well for me.

Really fantastic...OK this was a really great recipe. But I am working on improving my health and lifestyle by slowly altering the food I buy and prepare. So I took this recipe as a foundation and made a few changes: Instead of the crisco/shortening, I just used a full cup of butter. Instead of the white sugar, I substituted 3/4 cups of honey. I also added a tbsp of vanilla, a cup of coconut flakes, an extra 1/2 cup of flour, and 3 tbsp of ground Flax Seed. (I would also suggest trying whole wheat baking flour instead of the traditional enriched bleached flour). These turned into the most delicious 'melt-in-your-mouth' peanut butter creamy puffs. I'm always looking for great cookie recipes. So Thanks for the great recipe idea! I love Peanut butter!!

Mmmmmm......I made these today and every body loved them.  I did tweak it a little.  I added a teaspoon cinnamon and instead of the shorting and margarine I used butter.  I think all I have left is about 6 cookies.  Hubby told me he will be eating them tomorrow first thing.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I followed the rest of the recipe as stated with the exception of using all butter.  I used a small scoop sprayed with Pam, put on parchment paper and watched them from 8 minutes until 12 minutes.  The result was crumbly, too brown (used parchment) on the bottom and could hardly taste the peanut butter.  I really was disappointed in these cookies.  **UPDATE..I decided to give these another try since my kids wanted cookies.  I still used the butter only and added a dash of cinnamon.  They LOVED them, but I still got the same result as stated above.

DID NOT LIKE THESE!!  Not much peanut butter flavor and couldn't taste oatmeal.  I did use 1 cup of butter due to not having shortening, but that should have made the cookie taste better.  I will just stick to my own recipe!  It helped to add butterscotch morsels, and choc chips, but still didn't care for them!

Made these many times and my whole family loves them.  I now use 2 cups oatmeal, 1 1/2 cups peanut butter and whole wheat pastry flour. Sometimes we also add chocolate or peanut butter chips.  You must be careful not to over bake them.

These cookies are very good!!  I made them to send to my husband who is serving overseas.  I used butter instead of margarine and I added an extra 1/2 c. of oats.  I used Bob's Red Mill organic rolled oats because they are more hearty than the regular quick-cooking oats.  I also baked them on parchment paper which I think makes nicer cookies.  This is a great recipe and the cookies are yummy!

These were really tasty, but a little too thin and crispy for me.  I like my cookies thick and soft, so next time I make them, I will probably substitute the baking soda for baking powder, and add more oats.  I love oatmeal!

I'm enjoying one of these with a cup of tea as I write.  Absolutely wonderful, the perfect afternoon snack with the right amount of sweet and salt. Soft and chewy.  I simply used 2 sticks of butter instead of the shortening and margarine, otherwise I changed nothing.  
Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe as is. These are delicious. I also tried substituting 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour and added an extra 1/2 cup of oats. No one noticed the difference. Bake 10 minutes exactly and get ready to make another batch!

These cookies were delicious!  I baked them for 10 minutes just until they were light golden brown.  I allowed them to cool for a minute and then transferred them to a cookie rack while they were still warm and soft.  They set up pretty nicely - not too soft, not too crunchy...

Update: I forgot to mention that I used unsalted butter instead of margarine!

If you want a healthier yummy cookie try these changes-
replace butter/margarine with 1 c of yogurt
1 cup of turbinado raw sugar instead of the other sugars
double the oats (2 cups)
1.5 cups superfine wholewheat flour
add ground flax seed about 1/4 cup
use the rest of the ingredients with no other changes

These cookies had a nice cakelike peanuty flavor that didn't make me feel guilty for eating them.  The kids and husband gobbled them right up!

I am always looking for recipes where I can add whole wheat flour to. This was one of them. I added more oats. Changed the white sugar for splenda. TIP: Instead of fork to mark the cookies, I used a meat pounder, the rough side, of course.

These were good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on sugar and doubled the oats. I think it was TOO much on the oat side because the cookies were very crumbly. Next time I'll add more oats than the recipe calls for, but not double.

My son said this is the best peanutbutter cookie he ever tasted-and it was 3 days old when he got it by mail-he even had to hide them from his wife so she wouldnt eat them all. He only got one!!!He said "the perfect peanut butter cookie-he is my #1 peanut butter fan..I used evaporated milk instead of thick cream since I was mailing them (probably wouldnt have made a difference in freshness) and it worked great. A family staple from now on.

These cookies are the absolute worst thing for me to be eating but they are OH SOOOOOO GOOD!  Made as others suggested...2 sticks butter to sub for the shortening & margarine.  Extra Oatmeal & peanut butter. Half the flour was whole wheat & added vanilla.  Used less salt.  These cookies were perfectly crispy & perfectly chewy.  I kept the cookie dough in the fridge and baked as needed.  I finally had to bake the rest of the dough & give them to neighbors.  If not I would have gained 10 pounds in a week. IT'S A KEEPER!!!

This oatmeal peanut butter cookie turned out to be too sweet for me.  Others who tried them, however, said the cookies are good: chewey, even splendid. One said that the cookie was excellent.  Word of caution: don't over bake, just like the recipe says.  I used a big, white plastic ice cream scooper and just one shake to drop the cookie dough on the parchment paper to make 21 big round cookies.  I used parchment paper for each batch (and I let them cool on the paper because I don't have a cooling rack) and I left each batch in the oven for about 12 1/2 minutes.  I got to use a timer when I'm busy in the kitchen.

After reading some reviews, I did the following with the recipe: I used 1 c. butter, 1 1/4 c oatmeal, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and about 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips. In between batches, I kept the batter in the fridge and allowed the cookies to cool completely on the cookie sheet before transferring them. I also only allowed my butter to sit for about 10 minutes at room temperature before I started to cream together the ingredients. My cookies turned out picture perfect each time- they were soft, didn't spread too much while baking, and were 'poofy' as I had hoped. Next time though, I will use more peanut butter, b/c with only 1 cup of it- the flavor is very subtle. Good recipe if you follow the advice of others.

By far the best oatmeal/peanut butter cookie I've ever made. I substituted butter for the margerine and shortening, threw in a teensy vanilla and they were awesome. Only thing is make sure to keep an eye on them while in the oven. Sending to brother overseas and his buddies and him are going to love them!!! Thanks!

I normlly do not like to rate a recipe if I don't care for it. I think it would of been better with butter. I feel like the shortening overpowered. They definately need altered. Chocolate chips or nuts. The flavor is just kinda bland and peanut butter cookies are my favorite. The best thing I can say is the consistency of them is perfect.

These always turn out great! I cook them for no more than 10 mins, and substitute some of the white flour for whole wheat, and substitute the white sugar with Splenda. A great addition is about a half a cup of mini-m&ms!  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved these, even had a request for the recipe. I didn't have shortenign so I used butter, but next time I will use less than, as they tasted a little buttery for me, but still very good! I used natural pb and whole wheat flour.

with so many other good reviews I almost did not want to add mine BUT I will say these are very good and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I really think it needs an additional 1/2 cup of oats. (I love oats) Thats the only change I made and they are wonderful!

The taste was wonderful, but the cookies dried out awfully fast. I would have taken them out of the oven sooner if they had been able to stick together. Maybe rolling them into balls would have worked better than dropping them.

Delicious! I used 3/4 cups butter and 1/4 cups shortening, decreased the salt and increased baking soda, and increased oats to 1 1/3 cups although I wish now that I had used atleast 1 1/2 cups, because you could barely tell that there were any oats in them. I divided the batter into thirds and made some with white chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and milk chocolate chips. The best are the white chocolate, and I don't even usually like white chocolate chips.

This is by far one of the best cookie recipes that I've ever made, however I did make one slight change, I used butter instead of margerine. They were just lightly crispy on the edges and still soft in the middle.

Really excellent cookies - I don't change a thing.  People always want the recipe.  I bake mine on parchment paper so it's easy to de-pan them and I can have the next batch ready to slide on to the pan.

These were o.k.  Nothing spectacular really.   A bit too salty and just needed an extra something else, maybe vanilla?  I added some chocolate chunks in a second batch and they were better. Overall a bit too bland for my taste.

I am not a big fan of plain peanut butter cookies, so I thought I'd try these instead. I really enjoyed these cookies. I used butter and butter-flavored shortening. I added chocolate chips and Reese's peanut butter chips and chilled the dough for a couple of hours. Great cookies! Thank you!

I was craving oatmeal cookies and peanut butter cookies and found this recipe.  A full batch didn't quite last 2 days between me and my husband.  If you try these, make a double batch at least.

Made some very highly suggested changes to the recipe that yielded an absolutely awesome, perfect cookie: increased PB by 1/2 cup (crunchy highly recommended), added an extra cup of oatmeal (non-quick cooking), butter (salted) instead of margarine, used butter flavored crisco, added vanilla, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp and added in an extra 1/4 tsp of baking soda.  They were crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside, with a great texture. I dropped rounded spoonfuls and they flattened out to a perfect thickness- not at all thin and flat. The oatmeal and extra baking soda helped to prevent that.  Baked em on parchment paper on an airbake pan for 13 minutes at 350. Yummy warm out of the oven and still perfect the next day.

I can only give this recipe four stars because of the crisco factor.  I never use it in cookies, but decided to follow this recipe exactly and added it this time instead of subbing for butter like I normally do.  It was yucky.  The crisco makes the cookies greasy, and gives them a bland flavor with a nasty aftertaste.  My suggestion is to double the butter and omit the crisco, and bake for 12 minutes at 325.  I'll try again though, because I think this recipe could be excellent!

These cookies were very good, and warm/soft from the oven they were downright decadent! A teaspoon of vanilla added to the creamed ingredients made them even better. I used butter instead of margarine for the taste, but this was a mistake as the cookies did become extremely crumbly after cooling. I'll definitely be making these again, with margarine next time.

These cookies were amazing!! So light and delicious!! I subsituted real butter for the shortning and margine...and omited the salt and added ch'chips!! Yummy!! For my test cookies..I made them too big..and they were very hard to get off the pan..so my other batches I made them very small and they were perfect 2 bite cookies!! I also let them cool on the pan before I took them off...this cookie gets an A+!!! I don't think they'll last long...

These are awesome!  I used all margarine instead of shortening.  I also cut the white sugar in half.  Wonderful.  I added chocolate chips to part, and they were the best ever!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I actually have these cookies baking in the oven right now.  I used all butter and added approx. 1/4 cup extra of both peanut butter (I used organic which is a little less sweet) and flour.  I also added extra oats.  These are fantastic cookies....there is nothing I could do to make them any better!  They also bake very evenly and have a nice crackle appearance.  Thanks for the great recipe! :)

The only thing I changed was to use Splenda for the white sugar.  They are on the greasy side with so-so flavor, really think a tsp. of vanilla
is needed.  Chocolate chips add some flavor.

I'm rating these on behalf of my family as peanut butter cookies are not my favorite :)  They were very happy with these cookies.  I used butter and substituted part of the all-purpose flour w/whole wheat pastry flour.  Some people mentioned that these were salty - I used both unsalted butter and peanut butter and did not find the cookies salty so perhaps you should adjust the salt in the recipe according to the type of peanut butter and margarine/shortening/butter being used.

I thought these cookies were just "ok", nothing special.  I used replaced the shortening with butter and added vanilla, other than that I left it the same.  I did not think they were salty or particularly "peanut-y" tasting. I took another reviewer's advise and baked them for 10 minutes and they were underbaked.  I won't be making these again :(

Mmmmmm  very good.  Made these tonight and are very tasty and chewy.  I used all natural peanut butter.  You can make these chewy or crispy - just bake longer for a crispier texture.  Thanks for Sharing !

This is a tasty, chewy cookie. I added vanilla, chocolate chips, and more oatmeal. The only thing I did not like about them was that they spread so much while baking and turned out really flat. But my husband didn't seem to mind. He thinks they are excellent.

These are very good cookies.  I decided to make them this afternoon, since I had nearly all the ingredients.  I did substitute the shortening with unsalted butter, since I never have shortening in the house.  They do spread out quite a bit, so watch how many cookies you place on the baking sheet.  They were large, thin, golden cookies which were crispy and chewy.  I'm not a huge peanut butter cookie fan, but these were delicious.  You must have them with a cold glass of milk!

These cookies were good, but kind of tricky to make. I thought they were just okay, but I brought them to a party and everyone seemed to really like them.  I used a rounded measuring teaspoon of dough for each cookie (less than I usually use) and absolutely could not cook them any longer than 10 minutes. I had to take them out of the oven much earlier than before they looked browned.  They became much harder as they sat, so taking them out of the oven while they were still slightly mushy made them soft and chewy later.  Letting them reach the "slightly browned" point was much too overcooked. They got a really poor taste when they were crunchy.  And they definately need some more flavor.  I'd suggest using toffee pieces or chocolate chips.  They're not particularly great by themselves. They flatten out quite a bit, so a rounded teaspoon of dough made for a nice sized cookie.  They also made much more than 4 dozen.

I LOVED this cookie. After reading the reviews, I too made some modifications. I used 1 Cup of butter, increased the PB by 1/2c and also the oats by 1/2c. and I added in 1 tsp. of vanilla.I also did half the recipe with chocolate chips added in, YUMMY! This is such a nice change from the ordinary PB cookie. Thank you Michele.

THE BEST!!!!!  I made a couple of changes and additions, but followed the basics of the recipe.  I used all butter, 1 and 1/4 cup of PB, 1 tsp of vanilla, 2 cups of oats, 3/4 cup of m&m's, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  I also used a baking/pizza stone to bake these on and they turned out GREAT.  I think the stone makes a major difference in how the bottom of the cookie will turn out.  Can't wait to make these again :)  Thanks for sharing.

AWESOME!  Simple, quick and easy...I used butter with the shortening,  added a dousing of vanilla, used coarse salt, and dropped in a handful of extra-large semi-sweet chips...Dusted them with sugar...They are so delicious!  Next, I will try adding walnuts..Everyone loves them - GREAT recipe!!

I was looking for a peanut butter cookie that was different.  I don't really like the dry standard peanut butter cookie and I have a ton of peanut butter in my cupboards.  So I decided to try this one.  It is SOOOOO good and I'm not even a PB cookie lover.  I did add peanut butter chips because I had them.  I think choc chips would be yummy as well.  I used a scoop and they were a little "poofy" so I started squishing the ball down a little and then they made nice flat cookies.  I'll definately make again.

This is a great recipe (from what I've heard--I never usually eat the stuff I bake/cook around home).  I've become sort of the house baker and I'm always trying out new cookie/cake/bread recipes now and using my family as the guinea pigs (I'm 19).  My dad is a pb cookie FANATIC and he adored this.  Just can't stop eating them.  They do turn out fairly thin and crispy, but apparantly they work that way.  It's a nice change from the usual pb recipe I use which makes them nice 'n' chewy and thick.  They spread out and make lots of cookies, which is great.  Only problem is now my dad thinks I'm trying to make him fat. lol ;)

I made these cookies last night. YUK. The consistency of the cookie is good. (crisp outside and chewy inside) They bake perfectly round and look delicious. One bite and yuk. They taste bland, too salty, and too much baking soda.

If you make this cut the salt, decrease the baking soda, and add some chips for flavor.

I was disappointed because this recipe had such good reviews.

Great cookie! I use peanut butter chips and also add a teaspoon of vanilla. Great chewy/crumbly texture. The consistency of the dough really threw me for a loop the first time I made it; it was so light and fluffy that I thought I had added too many eggs or something. But now that I've made them 4 times I know that's how it's supposed to be.

I made these with old fashioned oats and 1 1/2 t Vanilla.  They turned out great. Next time I  will make it with 1 C sugar because I feel they need just a little more sweetness.

Listen, I made these (half-batch option because I live alone and value my blood-sugar levels) completely under the influence of marijuana (C.O.) and let me tell you: A) SO incredibly easy to make and I didn't have to leave the house to get any additional ingredients B) Freakin' delicious. They were so good they literally took my high to the next level. If you live in a Bud-friendly state here is my suggestion: roll yourself a fat joint and smoke it while you bake these delicious cookies, get yourself a tall glass of milk and when you pop those bad boy's out of the oven melt yourself on a cozy-a** couch and let those cookies take you to a whole other world -----

Peanut butter and oats! Great combination. I made the recipe as written with exception of sprinkling in chocolate chips. This cookie comes out of the oven uniform and with nice presentation. It’s delicious as well. I think it would make a nice addition to the Christmas cookie line up!!

My family really loved these, the new fave.  I made the changes suggested by another "most helpful" reviewer (increased flour by 1/4 c, oatmeal by 1/2 c, peanut butter by 1/2 c and added 1 tsp vanilla).  Made sure not to over blend.

Perfect Recipe: I bake them for 13 minutes and have added crushed pecans. Either way, they are awesome straight from the freezer! My wife likes to eat them half thawed.

Such a yummy cookie! They disappeared quickly! I made exactly as the recipe stated, except that I added 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla to the dough. Will make many more times! These are a delicious dairy-free option for those who are lactose intolerant

I made these tonight with my kiddos.  They were awesome!  I am giving these four stars because I made some adjustments to the recipe and I don't think they would have been as good without them.  First, I used all butter instead of butter and shortening.  Also, I used regular rolled oats and added an extra cup, plus a bag of mini M&Ms.  Even with the extra oatmeal and the M&Ms the dough was REALLY soft, so I chilled the dough for about an hour before baking, and chilled it in between batches in the oven to keep it cold.  These adjustments left us with a moist cookie that my kids gobbled up.  I just cut off my 9 year old after his ninth cookie. :)  Since he would tell you he doesn't like peanut butter, I think that must mean they are good.

I made these cookies to send to a college student and his friends who are studying for finals. My husband got into them before I could get them boxed to send. He thought they were wonderful. Now I have to make  another batch just for him. These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. I am not a fan of peanut butter cookies, but these take the prize. I didn't have any shortening on hand and do not use margarine in my cookies. I used 1 cup of butter. This recipe is one of my all time favorites now. Thank you Michele for this fabulous recipe.

Those were pretty darn good cookies! Some were overcooked, but made excellent coffee-cookies. I added chocolate chips (By request of my mom and dad!) All in all, and overall, great cookies.

Yummy cookies. Extra 1/2 cup flour, double the oatmeal and used regular oats. Added 1tsp vanilla and 1 cup chocolate chunks. Used all butter, no shortening. Would halve the salt next time. Delicious!! Will definitely make again!

Super quick and yummy as is. I treated this recipie like any other peanut butter cookie, rolled into a ball and marked with a potato masher dipped in white sugar, helps with uniformity and to bake evenly.

They were very good cookies. However I modified the recipe by adding half cup more of peanut butter in order to have a stronger flavor of peanut. The consistency was quite good if you like crunchy in the outside and a little soft inside!

cookies tasted great.  My husband would have preferred them more chewy rather than crispy so next time I think I'll change the crisco ratio or leave the crisco out and sub with butter altogether.

Tasty cookie with regular oats and 1/4 cup less white sugar. My batch yielded 5 dozen tablespoon sized cookies. I used my measuring spoon as my cookie press to make lovely half rounded cookies.

Great cookie recipe. Flavorful and chewy! The oatmeal added nice texture, and makes them a little more "healthy". I used all butter instead of half butter and half shortening. I used real peanut butter, which I think might be slightly saltier than skippy, so next time, I would cut the amount of salt down to 1/4 teaspoon.

I love these; they're light and crispy, but still nice and peanutty. I always get lots of compliments on them. One of my grandsons said they're the best cookies he's ever had--and he's a chocolate addict!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I had to modify it. I have celiac disease and made these gluten free utilizing rice, tapioca and potato starch flours plus 1/2t zanthan gum, 1t each of baking soda and baking powder. I also added 1t vanilla. My husband is always overjoyed when I add chocolate so I did. This is the 3rd time I've made these and decided to use m&ms. I have to say, the hard shell made them extra good.

Omg out of this world made these today,only thing I added was a half cup of crushed bran flakes. Gave the cookies some crunch, other then that I followed the recipe. I did bake for thirteen minutes. They are crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. I used a two and a half tablespoon cookie scoop. I have a bunch of bakery sized cookies that hubby just loves. This will be my forever peanut butter cookie recipe. Delish! I did put the cookie dough in the fridge while a batch was baking!

I made these cookies with the adjustment of half cup extra flour. I used crunchy peanut butter and all butter. Next time I would reduce the sugar. They were delicious , so light peanut buttery and chewy.

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE EVER!!! I brought some to a class and they absolutely flipped! One girl asked if she can hire me as her personal chef. These are the bomb! I did make a few modifications. I added 1/2 a cup of Peanut Butter. It still had the same nice peanut taste, but it was nice and light. The sweetness was perfect. TIP: If you don't have brown sugar, substitute it for white sugar with molasses. The ratio is for every 1 cup of white sugar, add 1 tablespoon of molasses. I do that for many recipes, but for this one I used brown sugar.

Our grand-daughter is severely allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, so I tried this recipe with Wow Butter. They turned out terrific. I don't think even the pickiest eater would be able to tell the difference. I also added chocolate chips which were produced in a nut-free facility. Will be making these again.

Pretty good recipe! I didn't have shortening so I just used salted butter and did not add the salt called for in the recipe. Also used all whole wheat flour (that's just how I roll). I also suddenly realized I had no eggs (oops!) So I made a flax seed egg (google it- it's amazing!) and everything turned out ok! Cookies were a little flat but I'll attribute that to the whole wheat flour and lack of real egg. Still delicious. Thanks!

My kids and I had a lot of fun making and eating these cookies! We followed the recipe except for the M&M's we added, and they were soft, gooey, and just about perfect. Six thumbs up from our family!

We tried this recipe today and I agree with the people who said adding white chocolate chips. I made half with and half without the white chocolate chips to see which one I liked better and I would definitely say with. I'm not sure if it was because I used applesauce in place of the white sugar so maybe the white chocolate chips added that sweetness that was lost from not using white sugar. We will definitely make this recipe again.

These were great!!  I made very few changes, and they were soft/chewy, and super tasty.  I used all white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and I used coconut oil in place of the shortening.  I also left out the salt, since my peanut butter and butter were both salted.  I'm glad I did, too, because they were the perfect saltiness without it.  The kids and I loved them!

My husband loved them.  I did make a few adjustment to our liking.  Added 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 full cups oatmeal and added pecans (here in Texas we like pecans).  Baked for only 10 min.  They weren't too sweet with adding the nuts and extra oatmeal.  Wanted to put more protein and fiber into making a healthier cookie.  I also pressed them a bit with a fancy glass bottom.

These cookies turned out very well.  Not too sweet but just right.  I substituted butter for the margarine, used chunky peanut butter instead of smooth, and rolled oats instead of quick oats.  I will definitely be making these again.  My husband loved them too.

These were a perfectly textured cookie in my opinion. I really loved them. I should mention that I used salted butter instead of margarine because that is what I had on hand. I just decreased the amount of salt added to the flour mixture. I also increased the peanut butter and oatmeal a 1/2 cup each because I just love them so much :)  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is a keeper!  I followed a few recommendations from reviewers like adding vanilla, and extra 1/2 cup of oats, 1 cup of chocolate chips.  In addition, I chilled the cookie sheets and the cookie dough between batches which makes a big difference in appearance.  May try other variations as suggested like white chocolate chips or almond butter.  Bravo & thanks Michele for a great recipe!

The only deviation I made from the recipe was to use lightly salted butter instead of the other shortenings because that's what I keep in the house.  I left out the salt in the flour mixture to compensate. They were easy to make and delicious. I would describe the texture as chewy- perfect in my opinion. I used a small cookie dough scoop (1 TB?) to scoop the dough directly onto cookie sheets which I then placed the trays into the freezer to chill.  In the oven they spread out to 2".  I took them out at 11 minutes when they were just starting to brown,  and removed them from the cookie sheet immediately. 

This recipe I'm adding to my small hand written recipe book. Only the best go in there. It's that good.

These cookies are amazing!! Perfect crispy texture and melt in your mouth! I made a few small variations and they were still incredible. Instead of the butter and margarine, I used half a cup of melted butter and half a cup of extra virgin olive oil which added a great rich flavor. I also used only 3/4 cup of oats and added in 1/2 of grated coconut. To add a little spice, I added, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg. The cookies were unbelievably rich but with a light buttery texture! My new favorite cookies!

I and everyone I gave these to loved them. I used all butter because that's all I had. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I reduced the sugar by half a cup and used 1 cup of chopped peanuts and half & half crunchy and creamy PB. Added 1/2 cup more oats too. So, yeah I'm being one of those people who fiddle then review. I think that the basic recipe is ideal for experimental changes. One thing to note is that the recipe gave little directions for the end. I found that pulling 2 T balls of dough size cookies out at 10 minutes, when they're golden on the edges and a little the tops and letting them rest for 3-5 min on the pan allowed them to set perfectly. And still be chewy in the middle a little crisp on the edge. 9 minutes baking with 3 min setting up still on the cookie sheet resulted in a more chewy and tender pb cookies.

Tried making these using the drop method as per instructions.  Then switched tactics and rolled the dough into small balls and then in sugar before baking.  Liked these better.  Were just a tad too dry, so don't add additional oatmeal.  I rolled mine in red sugar as I plan on sending these to grandkids for Valentine's Day.

I've never liked peanut butter cookies, but these were good.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I made all the modifications that ZJSGRAM suggested: butter-not margarine, extra flour-1/4 cup, add 1 tsp vanilla, butter flavored Crisco-not regular shortening, 1 cup chunky peanut butter and 1/2 cup creamy pb, extra 1/2 cup of oats added and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I cooked them for 11 minutes and that was perfect.  I rolled the cookies into 2 inch balls and then partially flattened them.  It made 52 large cookies, so the cookies in this recipe had to be pretty small, considering all the extra ingredients I added.  I think ZJSGRAM should publish this recipe as her own with all the good modifications.  I understood that only one change to a recipe made it yours.  Do try!

I loved this recipe. The original was great for cookies, and with a bit of tweaking, these made wonderful no bakes. For the no bake cookies I used this recipe, but substituted the butter and shortening with unsalted butter. Follow recipe as listed, but omit the eggs. Tastes great baked, or "no-baked"!

I tried it, and added about 1T more peanut butter, 1T more oats and used butter instead. The texture isn't what I remember about PB cookies, it just doesn't "do it" for me. Put it into a bag immediately and they stay moist, that's good. Just not what I want personally.

Definitely a light cookie. I was looking for a peanut-buttery cookie, unfortunately it did not hot the mark. I added some chocolate chips which made them taste much better.

These are a bit of every flavor, if you add chocolate chips, as we did.  Cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup almond butter and used crunchy peanut butter.   Only used 1/2 teaspoon salt and added an extra half cup of oatmeal, a teaspoon of vanilla and about 10 ounces of mini chocolate chips.  Thanks for sharing

So amazing that three of us ate a dozen cookies in one sitting. I used 1 c.  butter instead of the shortening/margarine combo. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and followed Carist's handy tips. The cookie balances the oatmeal and peanut butter flavors perfectly. My cookies were soft, chewy, and heavenly. Excuse me while I go and eat another one...

delicious cookies!  I made them smaller than normal and had a hard time getting the baking time right - they all came out crispy - but that's my fault for making them smaller and using all butter instead of shortening/margarine.  I will add more oats next time, or possibly use half whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose - they can handle the "weight".  I used natural peanut butter (only ingredients are peanuts and salt) and the sweetness of the cookie was just right.

I modified this just a touch.  Added vanilla (a must!) and as the batter looked a bit soft, added 1/4 c more flour.  I was a tad short on the oats so I added a packet of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal (which turned out fine) and I almost fainted when I saw I was about 1/3 cup short on the peanut butter but I had some almond butter so I used that.  I normally don't modify recipes that much.  I did follow the recipe and use shortening and butter.  I'm glad I did (and I always use butter!).  The cookies baked at 350 for 14 minutes and they were big and beautiful.  I myself don't fancy peanut butter cookies but I felt like making something different and my hubby and I can both take them to work.  Honestly, they were really tasty and nice looking.  Oh, I also threw a couple of handfuls of Rice Krispies and chocolate chips for fun.  I will make these again!

These cookies were amazing! I could barely get them out of the oven before people were eating them. Easy to follow recipe. I did turn down the oven to 325 half way through baking because I was afraid they would burn. These were really more peanut butter cookies more than oatmeal so next time I will add more oats. Thanks for the recipe.

Great cookie! I used my homemade PB/cookie butter in this recipe.  I only bake with butter or coconut oil. I replaced the sugar with palm sugar and added some chunks of chocolate from Aldi(they sell the best) and a few chia seeds.  They turned out soft and chewy!! :)

The only change I made was I used butter in place of the marg as I didn't have any. 
After I made them exactly as called for (they were great) I added a tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup of extra oats, and peanut butter chips and milk chocolate chips (about a hand full each).  WHEN I make these again I will omit the chocolate or uses semi sweet.  I baked them for 12-14 min depending on how big I dropped/rolled them

Hot Dang!  This recipe is awe.some.  I made it gluten free by using buckwheat flour, didn't use shortening, just 3/4 soy and gluten free butter and 1/4 cup olive oil.  There is not much sweet stuff that I can eat on my diet (no soy or dairy or caffeine), so these were, oh, heaven sent.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe -- and one that is easy to use alternate ingredients!

This is a keeper. Only difference is that I used unsalted butter instead of margarine because I don't have any margarine.  I will make these over and over. 
OP should consider adding at least one hour chill to the dough recipe. It really makes such a substantial difference in the shape and form of the cookie.  I wouldn't make them without it.

Absolutely the BEST peanut butter cookie out there! I used butter and butter flavored crisco equally. I added an extra 1/2 c of oatmeal. These are phenominal! Will def make again!

My family couldn't decide between sugar, snickerdoodle, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies one night. This recipe was perfect! I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batch and the cookies came out so yummy! It solved all 4 cookie cravings in one cookie!

Love this recipe. It is my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies. I substitute butter for the shortening, add about a teaspoon of cinnamon, a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and I double the oats. Have also added 1 cup craisins for a bit of fun.

This is spectacular!  Peanut butter cookies are my favorite, and this is easy and delicious.  I did learn one thing as I was baking....for the prettiest cookies, roll into balls rather than drop them.  And don't smash them with a fork like with other peanut butter cookies.  I didn't have margarine, so I used butter.  I also used crunchy peanut butter.  After I mixed all the ingredients together, I chilled the dough in the fridge for about an hour while I did a couple other chores.  I think that is why they raised just a little and are just beautiful to look at! This will be my new go-to recipe for peanut butter cookies!

Good peanut butter flavor but a little salty I think. With the salt in the peanut butter, the salted butter (1 stick that I used instead of margarine), and the added salt in the recipe it made them a tad too salty. Husband said they were good. I added an extra half cup of oats per review suggestions and I'm glad I did. I baked some of the cookies with semi sweet chocolate chips, a few cookies with white chocolate chips, and some of the cookies with no chocolate chips at all just to see what tasted best. They all tasted good with or without chips.  I guess I would make again but I would cut back on the salt.

Yummy!  And so much easier than most peanut butter cookie.  Crispy on the outside, soft and scrumptious on the inside.    If you choose to add chocolate chips, it's even better!

These are awesome! My hubby wasn't thrilled because they are on the flatter and more crispy side as cookies go (he likes his thick and chewy) but there is still a LOT of great chewy texture to these and the flavor is fantastic! I love this recipe! I threw in some Reese's pieces and used chunky peanut butter but otherwise followed the instructions and would definitely make these again. Love the crispy with the chewy.

Deliciouso! I followed the recipe as it was, just adding Reeses Peanut Butter chips for extra punch and these were fabulous!!! You can't even tell the oatmeal is in there and they give it a good texture. I used tablespoons and baked them for 14 minutes. The keys to my cookies coming out so well are due to the following:
1. test batch - I bake 2 cookies to see if temp and size are correct.
2. ALWAYS use parchment paper - it has made a world of difference
3. Chill batter in between baking batches
4. I only put 6-8 cookies on one sheet, so they are not overcrowded and bake evenly.

To make these healthy:  I used all butter instead of shortening and margarine.  Use sucanat instead of brown sugar.  Use only 1/2 cup white sugar and add a glop of honey.  Use whole-wheat flour and natural peanut butter.  Add a few tbsp of wheat germ and ground flax seed.  Cut the salt in half.  
They turned out very good!  Remember if you're using sucanat to stir them a little longer.

BEST COOKIES EVER! I found this recipe several years ago and bake these cookies quite often. Everyone always raves about them, asks if I will be making them for the next Christmas party, pot luck, etc. Like many others, I use real butter and add a little vanilla... Other than that, I follow the recipe as is and they are perfect!

Best flavor of any OC I've ever made....could hardly stay out of the batter as each batch baked. I used 2 sticks of sweet/salted butter instead of shortening and margarine. Came out perfect...although I only got 36 out of this amount.

I really liked these cookies! I used butter instead of shortening/margarine, and I also rolled the cookies in sugar before I put them into the oven. I will definitely make these again. :)

These were so good, can't keep them in the house.
My family loves them, the only changes I made was reducing the white sugar to 1/2cup, 1/4cup more oats, and self rising flour instead of ap flour which eliminates the baking soda. I cooked them for 10-11 minutes, so soft and chewy with a light brown color.

YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!!!! I used a dark chocolate peanut butter & substituted butter for margarine and these cookies were SO popular. Now that they are all gone the family is begging for more.

I thought my previous peanut butter cookie recipe was pretty good. These are far superior, so easy to make and quite hearty with the peanut and oats. I add a little vanilla but otherwise this is great as-is.

I would give this 5++ stars, but not as written.  When I made them the first time (halved) I used only butter.  More importantly, I used baking powder and not baking soda, by accident.  I added a pinch of baking soda after I discovered the mistake. Also, the oats were about 1/2 (ran out) They were the best!!  
I just finished the recipe as written.  It is not really anything like the fantastic accident that I had.  Not so remarkable.

Excellent cookie a nice take on the classic peanut butter tasted very good mine cooked to perfection in about 10 minutes and then I let them cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes very good the only thing I might do next time is add just a bit more oats... I also used all butter in mine... with great results...

This is an awesome recipe. So easy too! I used my peanut butter jar instead of the measuring cup, and followed all quantities just as in the recipe (ex: for 1 cup peanut butter I used 1 jar peanut butter; I think it was like 150g or 200g jar, and measured everything else with the jar), and two eggs. I added 1 1/2 jars of oats, my daughter doesn't like the flakiness in oats, so I powdered in the blender and followed the exact recipe! I omitted the white sugar and used 1/2 jar of brown sugar instead - so it was 1 1/2 jars of brown sugar. Voila! My 4 yr old, had it for breakfast this morning she insisted that I pack some for her lunch at nursery! THANK YOU THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!

The recipe is awesome, though I mixed it up a bit. I used whole wheat flour, added a teaspoon of almond extract, stirred in hazelnuts and omitted the white sugar all together, used all real butter instead of the shortening margarine mixture. Plus I chilled the dough for an hr before baking and only baked for 10 minutes. These cookies were a big hit with friends and family.

Pretty good peanut butter cookie.  I didn't have shortening, so I used butter instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I found them to be not quite sweet enough for my taste, but that could be from the kind of peanut butter I used (100% natural, self ground).  I will make these again, though.

Excellent!  I increased the oats to 1 1/2 cups and used crunchy peanut butter for a little extra texture.  I usually don't use shortening but it does give a wonderful crisp texture.  I rolled the dough into small balls for a perfectly, round cookie and refrigerated it in-between batches for easier handling.  These are absolutely perfect!

We made a few changes. 1/2 the salt, 1/3 cup of oil instead of shortening, & only 1/2 cup organic sugar instead of the 3/4 cup it calls for. Everyone liked it, although they were still just a tiny bit too sweet. Overall, very good!

Awesome cookie!  Made it with all unsalted butter and added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and would say more oats for sure -- maybe 3/4 cup.  They are being gobbled up as we speak!

These are delicious! Due to lack of ingredients on hand, I had to make a few substitutions and they STILL turned out fabulous. No lard or shortening so used two sticks of salted butter. Not enough brown sugar so made my own with my vanilla sugar I make and keep on hand, mixed with some molasses until it reached the correct color. Mine baked to perfection in exactly ten minutes. I turn my cooky sheet half way through bake time to ensure even browning. My husband took some to work and they were gone in less than 10 minutes. I'm thinking County Fair entry. Thanks for a lovely recipe.

Absolutely love this cookie! I was about 1/3 cup short on oats so I added more flour. Came out great! I would describe the flavor as "fluffy and light".
I doubled the recipe and used a small cookie scoop. This yielded about 120 small cookies.

this recipe is amazing! im still in the process of making more batches cuz this recipe makes like 4 dozen! i rated this a 4 simply because i altered the recipe just a little. i added about 1 1/2 teas. of vanilla extract, and an extra 1/2 cup of oats because i felt like it required more oats, but that may just be a taste preference. i also added about another 1/2 cup of PB, because i like my pb cookies really peanut buttery, there again a taste preference. i decided to eliminate the salt altogether since i used regular pb and was afraid they'd come out to salty, and who wants a salty cookie?! i also find that rolling the dough into balls and doing the traditional PBC criss cross patern with a fork makes them come out looking uniformed and pretty every time!!! over all an AMAZING recipe, one that can be altered easily to taste and fun to experiment with! will deffinatly keep this one in my recipe box for a later date!!!

I made these cookies last week and they will be made again. They were excellent. The only changes I made was I added 1/2 tsp pure vanila and I put 2 cups of chocolate chips in. I can not have peaunut butter with out chocolate. The texture of this cookie was great. You better have a glass of milk with these cookies....

In response to the comments about cookies spreading, all you need to do to avoid it is use a Silpat or line your cookie sheet with parchment.

This is an incredibly delicious cookie! The only thing I did differently was all butter and used old fashioned oats because that's what I had.  We also added dark chocolate m&m's.  These cookies have the perfect peanut butter flavor and they were soft and almost creamy inside.

A-MAZ-ING!  Perfectly crisp on the outside while soft and moist inside. I did substitute butter for the margarine as I didn't have any and I added the tsp of vanilla.

Perfect!  Followed it to the T.  I did use the tricks from another reviewer...use chilled shortening/butter, don't mix it too much or it warm up and use cool baking sheets to put dough on.  I did one pan at time, letting the other cool down while one pan was baking.  The cookies turned out perfect!

Fabulous cookie.  Two things:  I was low on plain oats and only had 1/2 the amount required.  So I added in 1 packet of Quaker Oats Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal.  And because I'm a chocolate head also added in 1 cup of semi sweet morsels.  Total yum factor.

Can't decide between oatmeal or peanut butter cookies? These are your best option. But, they were a bit on the dry side. Next time, they'll probably turn out better with chocolate chips. Overall, it's a tasty treat and easy to make.

No question that it was tasty. I also added and extra 1/2c oats per other reviewers, however I found the cookies to be a little dry and I stuck clser to the 10min mark rather than 15. Maybe less oats and all butter?

This was a very good cookie! I doubled it and lowered the sugar a bit (the PB I used had sugar in it - wasn't "all natural"), basically omitting the brown sugar and adding 1T. of molasses to make up for it. Turned out plenty sweet and yummy. I also added some chocolate chips.

this is slightly unfair, I am rating this recipe on the results if you only use butter.  Even after chilling the dough for an hour the cookies came out very flat and too delicate for my purposes (kid snack).  Clearly other people have great success following the recipe, so my suggestion is you don't deviate from the recipe like I did

Very good.  I also used butter instead of the margarine so they were more flat, but still yummy and chewy.   I used the Pampered Chef cookies scoop and made 3 doz.  I switched to the small scoop and they were just the right size.

Just finished baking these scrumptious cookies! Made them exactly as given. The only thing I did different was to make small cookies. I ended up with 84, bakiing them 10 minutes. While one batch was in the oven, I had one batch chilling on the cokie sheet in the refrigerator for 10 minutes prior to baking. I also used a silpat on each cookie sheet.  Very nice golden color and best of all--chewy!

Really good cookies. (I love anything peanut butter) Verrry buttery.  I didn't have shortening so I used a little less than a cup of butter.  I think next time, I could definitely get away with less butter.  Delicious, soft in the middle, and crunchier on the outside.  I think I will double the oats at least--could hardly tell they were there!

These were popular with everyone but me- way too rich for my tastes. Nothing wrong with the recipe, I guess I'm just not hardcore enough for these cookies!

So I changed a few things in the recipe and things still seemed to work out deliciously!

I used butter instead of shortening or margarine. I omitted the white sugar and it was sweet enough just with the brown. I added kamut flakes in addition to the oats to increase the fiber content. I'm not sure I'll do that again as the kamut stayed quite hard. Oh, and since I didn't have crunchy peanut butter I just added peanuts I pulsed in a food processor. I would make this recipe again!

I made these today exactly as described except i used 1 cup butter. I don't use margarine ever and I don't use shortening often. Other than that they came out ok. I was looking for a thick fluffy cookie and these were more like flat cookies. They weren't bad, but they weren't as amazing as i was hoping.

Delicious!  I added some Mexican vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup of sugar (on accident).  They were perfect!  A tiny bit crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  YUM!

I used the big Pampered Chef scoop and two cookie sheets.  6 minutes in I switched and rotated the sheets for even cooking.  They turned out perfectly cooked (in Austin).  Also, make sure to leave them on the pan for a few minutes to cool, otherwise they'll fall apart when you try to transfer them to the cooling rack.

Great cookie. I added walnuts for some crunch. I think next time I might not put in as much soda.

This has to be the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've ever tried.  For the last batch I made, I substitued white flour with whole wheat pastry flour and they turned out AMAZING!  This will definitely become one of my "go to" recipes :)

These were awesome!  I did everything like listed except I did add 1t vanilla and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white (good time to slip it in with the peanut butter being so strong).  I think there could stand to be 1 less teaspoon of soda, my cookies are kinda falling apart because they are too airy.  For 1 cup of brown sugar you shouldn't need more than 1t of soda.  Crumbly and all these are great tasting cookies...

I LOVE these cookies.  My friend made them 1st and then I looked up the recipe.  We live in South America so adding the additional flour (1/4-1/2 cup more) and oats (1/2 C more) worked out perfectly!  Someone reviewed that these were missing something.  Maybe try vanilla or almond extract.  These were a hit with the whole family!  Defintely one to add to the recipe book for sure!

Although these cookies were sweet and tasty they lacked the umph factor that would make me want to bake them again. Just seemed to have "something" missing.

Really good! Tastes amazing. I followed the recipe to a tee and the result was fabulous.  Seemed a little grainy but not bad at all.  Not enough oats though! Next time I would double the oats.! It's a great treat and my whole family loves the cookies. :^)

Great peanut butter cookie!  I like my peanut butter cookies soft and chewy, not crunchy, but still with flavor.  This one hit the spot!  I will definitely be saving this recipe.  They are a bit salty, so I might try reducing the salt and increasing the oatmeal next time.  Chocolate chips as others have mentioned would be good as well.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Added 1/4 cup extra flour and 1/2 cup extra oats.  They came out a little saltier than most cookies, but they taste just perfect like that!  Delicious!

AWESOME!  These are the best, so easy to make and everybody loves them.  Even those folks that are not super keen on peanut butter.  Definitely a keeper in my house.  I made no modifications to the recipe.  Simply delish..with just the right amount of peanut butter flavoring and oatmeal texture without being too dry.

Best Peanut Butter Cookie I have ever had!  The only thing that I changed was using all margarine instead of the shortening, because that's what I had.  Turned out fluffy and super moist!!!  My family can't keep they're hands off!

YUMMMMMM!  I love to bake cookies and this will be a keeper recipe.  I thought they were way to sweet (and I like sweet) so next time will use a scant amount of sugar.  I increased the oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups but kept the shortening & butter (instead of margarine) and peanut butter amount the same.  May bake 12 minutes instead of the 10 some others recommended.

Followed the recipe to a T and turned out great. Just set your timer for ten mins and watch the last couple mins to make sure you dont burn them. These cookies are a great change from having chocolate chip cookies. You dont have to worry with these cookies being bad these have plenty of 5 star ratings.

I have made a lot of cookies, and this may be the best recipe I have ever used!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used real butter in place of the margarine and shortening.  I used a scant 1/2 t of salt.  I also added vanilla and doubled the amount of oats (old fashioned worked well).  You could probably easily use 3c of oats in this recipe.  I also used 1 c chocolate chips.  Next time I might not add as much sugar.  I got rave reviews from all who tried them!  Thanks for this recipe!

Yum, these are the best peanut butter cookies, not dry like some...I use to think peanut butter cookies were ok now I think they are great, I made with real butter, no shortening and added a tsp of vanilla.  I put vanilla in just about everything.

OMG! These cookies are so yummy! I did as some previous people suggested and bumped the PB and oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups, added tsp of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon. Everything else I kept the same and put the dough in the freezer between batches. PERFECTION!  My kids (who don't like oatmeal) sighed with delight! Definately will make again!

Great recipe! I made these to use up some PB before a trip, and my husband (who claims he doesn't like PB cookies) kept asking me to pass him the bag of cookies. I love the extra chew the oatmeal gives these, and I'll definitely be making them again.

Very good cookie. I used Splenda white sugar and brown sugar.  Plus I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a handful of raisons.

very easy to make and the cookies are very fluffy and crispy at the same time.  I used butter only and baked about 12-13 min.  Using half the recipe with my cookie scoop, i got about 3 dozen.

Very yummy and easy! I like not having to press them down with a fork. Next time I'll cut out the additional salt; for me, there's enough salt in the regular store peanut butter.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  They are perfect!  I made them for my mom for her birthday because peanut butter cookies are her favorite.  Now she will have a new favorite...Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies. The only change I made was that I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.

These are absolutely phenomenal. Several people suggest increasing flour/oatmeal, so I don't do it to any specific extent, but just don't level off cups when I measure. I also put the dough in the fridge to let it chill for at least an hour. These are absolutely amazing- the perfect blend of salty and sweet and they stay chewy!

I got the basic recipe here, and did some improvising. I used 1 cup butter, whole wheat flour, unrefined sugar instead of white sugar, and added raisins, and a tsp vanilla.

This is an amazing cookie.  I used butter instead of margarine since I usually don't have it.  They are very peanut buttery which I like.  Very easy dough to work with and mine were done in 10 minutes.  Thanks for this great recipe.

this recipe was a disappointment. It lacked taste to me--seemed bland and not sweet enough although it had a good deal of sugar--my family did not like it.

Mmmmmmmmm. I made a half batch thinking 48 would be way too many. Boy, was I wrong! We're eating through these like there's no tomorrow! I did make alterations and thought about not mentioning them, but maybe it will encourage another reviewer with food allergies to make these cookies! I used sunbutter instead of peanut butter, all shortening, and an egg-replacer powder instead of the eggs. I was worried because the dough was quite dry, but they baked perfectly! It was the first "peanut butter" cookie my allergic daughter has had - she loved them!! Thank you for this recipe!!

These are by far the "BEST" peanut butter cookie I've ever had or made! Love love love these! They even outdid my mom and grandma's peanut butter cookie AND the oatmeal only makes them that much tastier and chewier! Delicious crunch on outside and chewy goodness in the middle! Perfect! Oh I also only used 1 cup of stick butter and added 1 tsp of vanilla!

I followed the reviews and added extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal (quaker traditional). The cookie was okay, not chewy but a bit on the crumbly side (waited til cold) and it was a bit too sweet for me despite the fact that I used unsweetened homemade peanut butter. This recipe I will keep but will eliminate the white sugar entirely.

This recipe is great. They do expand quite a bit so a teaspoon is all you need per cookie. I used whole wheat flour and egg whites and you could not tell the difference. Delicious!

These are definitely the best peanut butter cookie I've ever made.  I used butter instead of margarine, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out wonderfully.  They came out moist and delicious, just watch the baking time as others said, don't want to overbake!  The only thing I might change would be to add more oats next time, but that's moreso just a personal preference.  As-is the recipe is fantastic.

This was an excellent recipe!  I love that it wasn't too "peanut-buttery."  However, I like my cookies thick and chewy so I added an extra 1/2 C of flour.  Next time I think I will throw in some chocolate chips!

I really liked these cookies!!! The oatmeal is subtle and adds a nice texture.  I have only given one cookie recipe EVER 5 stars...but this comes close!  I made some minor modifications to make them a bit healthier.... - Egg Substitute instead of eggs - brown sugar splenda instead of brown sugar - 2/3 cup of white sugar, 1/3 cup of splenda - Light margarine - 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour - I used half regular PB and half all natural

Scrumptious!!! Always made chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, this is the first for me.  I used 1 c. of butter instead of shortening and margin, turned out perfect! I had to press down the cookie dough with a small fork which actually helped to shape the cookies better.  I know now why pb cookies have lines running across on the top.

These went FAST!  I'm fairly inexperienced in the kitchen, but these were very simple and SO tasty!  I had to make a few modifications due to lack of ingredients.  I substituted butter for the shortening (which did lead to spreading), 1/4 cup maple syrup & 3/4 cup regular sugar substituted for the brown sugar.  6 teaspoons baking powder instead of baking soda.  And I used two packets of instant oatmeal (maple & brown sugar flavored) instead of regular oats.  I was running low on peanut butter after this recipe, and my husband bought two HUGE jars of it as a hint that he wanted more.  These cookies were definitely a hit, even with all the modifications.  I can only imagine how wonderful they will be with all the right ingredients!

These cookies were amazing! They were chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, and they didn't stick to the pan at all! I loved how the oats tasted and gave texture to the cookies! I did end up halving the recipe, but I still ended up with about 5 dozen teaspoonful sized cookies. Anyway, I also added about 3/4 of a cup of chocolate chips (maybe that is why I got so many more than the recipe said), and a half teaspoon of vanilla (because I LOVE vanilla!).  I also cut back on the salt and only used half of what the recipe called for. These cookies are definitly a keeper! By the way, make sure NOT to overbake them, or else they will get really hard!

Excellent!!  The balance of flavors is just right.  I think these are a little on the sweet side so next time I make them, I will cut back on the sugar (probably 3/4 c. for brown sugar OR 1/2 cup for white sugar).    I freeze the balls of cookie dough in a freezer bag.  To cook, I add 2-3 minutes onto the cooking time and bake from frozen.

this turns out lighter than "typical" peanut butter cookies.  I thought they were better when rolled and flattened before baking.  they definitely have to sit for a bit bfore removing from the pan, they will crumble otherwise.  I agree with adding a bit of cinnamon and vanilla.  More oatmeal might be good too, and chopped nuts.

This recipe exceeded my expectations.  They were soft and tender with a hint of a background crunch (provided by the oatmeal).  Glorious.  I used 100% real butter (no shortening for this girl), and regular whole oatmeal (instead of quick-cooking).  At 15 minutes they'll appear "undercooked", but remove them from the oven with confidence and let them rest/set.  They'll be perfect...

Pretty tasty!  I added some vanilla, cinnamon, and just a tad more oatmeal.  The edges are a bit crumbly but they held together nice and are soft and moist in the center.

I love this cookie!  I added a 1/2 c. more oats and a tsp of vanilla thanks to other people's reviews.  It is so much better than just a regular peanut butter cookie.

Great cookie, but use BUTTER rather than margarine. I only had 1/2 c of Peanut Butter in the pantry so I used it but added an extra 1/4 c of butter and 1/2 c of Toffee chips. They were AWESOME! Mine did spread, probably because of the extra butter, but I wanted them to. I only baked them for 10 min and took them out when the edges got brown. Also the other reviewers are correct, they really needed to cool for a while in the pan or they fell apart. I got 5 dozen cookies out of this recipe and my husband can not stop raving about how chewy and moist they are. Next time I will make them just as the recipe says, but will add some coarsely chopped skinned and salted Virginia Peanuts or cocktail nuts. Toffee chips were a nice extra too! Don't worry about them spreading, I can not stand fat, dry, Oatmeal cookies that end up tasting like woody pulp. A little thinner but moist, buttery and chewy is better to my personal taste. I am adding this recipe to my recipe box! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made those with almond butter and received rave reviews from family. Those cookies really do spread in the oven! I wanted some giant cookies so I made them with a tablespoon, and the final products were about 4 inches in diameter. Also, I only baked my giant cookies at 325 degrees F for 13 minutes and they were already very well done; so I think that maybe the baking time on the recipe should be reduced a little. They are very soft while warm, so let them sit on the baking sheet for two or three minutes before moving onto the wire rack.

I have terrible luck with cookies (or maybe it's just me!), but I've been craving some lately. I made these, using heaping measuring cups of flour and 1 1/2 c of oatmeal. I also added some vanilla and chocolate chunks. They're the best cookies I've ever made! I've only got the second batch in the oven right now, and I've already eaten three! Thanks so much!

Perfect cookies! I used butter instead of shortening, doubled the (natural) peanut butter and the (old-fashioned) oats and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract. They are crunchy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. Will definitely make them again.

These were really good but I think they could use more oats, maybe 1 1/2 - 2 cups instead of the 1 cup it called for. I also added some white and semi sweet chocolate chips and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. Will definitely makes these again.

My husbands Navy buddies call these the "Oatmeal Cookies of Death!" because they cant ever just eat one. My climbing buddies refer to them as "Climbing Cookies" because the have everything you'd need for a tough day at the crag. Whatever you call them- this is easily my FAVORITE cookie recipe. The only thing I change is to add 1C of dark chocolate chips.

This is a good recipe. I used about a third whole wheat flour and butter instead of margarine/shortening. Half of the cookies I baked this way, the other half I added a chopped up dark chocolate bar to make peanut butter chocolate chunk cookies -- they were a total hit!

Awesome cookies!  I love soft, chewy peanut butter cookies and the oatmeal in these cookies really made them extra good.  I made half the batch as is and the second half I added peanut butter chips and chocolate chips.  I also added some extra oatmeal, which didn't hurt them at all.  They are a hit and my whole family loves them.  Thanks so much!

My husband LOVES peanut butter cookies, but this recipe was by far his favorite!  He couldn't stop eating them and still can't believe how good they were.  I did try putting chocolate chips (semi-sweet) in half the batch, but we thought they overpowered the peanut flavor and the oats.  I also took the suggestion of using butter instead and it worked well.  This makes a TON of cookies!

Not sure what happened.  Turned out "cakie" instead of chewy.  I had to throw out the whole batch.  Oh well, on to the next cookie ... maybe it's me.

They need ten stars, seriously. I made exactly as the recipe stated. Delicious! Mine were done right at ten or eleven minutes, and had that gorgeous craggy top like a bakery cookie. Thanks for this one.

These cookies were okay, but with some minor changes they may rate a 4 in my book. Next time I would use a bit less salt, definitely add vanilla, and some chocolate chips for sweetness. Overall, they were good this time, but not great...don't know if even making the changes I mentioned would ever make them rate a 5 as far as I am concerned.

The best! I followed the recipe Exactly, didn't change a thing and they turned out great! One tip to people using this recipe, they fluff up a lot so leave a bit more room in between when baking! Thanks for the Recipe!

The best peanut butter oatmeal cookie I have come across! I used butter and crisco for the flavor and texture. I doubled the oats and it was perfect for us. I omitted the salt because it is salty enough from PB and decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I may add peanut butter chips or chocolate chips in the future but this recipe is rich enough with 1 cup of PB.

Rave reviews! I added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to make them even more delish. I will make them again. Thank you, thank you.

These were AMAZING!!!  I made half of them according to recipe and added chocolate chips to the other half.  The entire family has said these are a must-make-again cookie!

This recipe is very bland.  Like most peanut butter cookies, the true flavor didn't come out until hours later if not the next day.  But even then they were still very bland.  I'm so glad I added chocolate chips.  Otherwise these would have just been boring.  After viewing other peoples pictures I was fearful of them being flat.  So I took another reviewers suggestion, to increase the peanut butter and oatmeal both by a 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I was also mindful not to over beat the creamed batter and to place dough on a cool pan with parchment paper.  I'm not sure if it helped, but mine came out fluffy and are not crisp at all.  Very soft cookie.  I'm not sure I will bake these again, just b/c they are lacking flavor.

Delicious!  These were chosen as a birthday treat, and therefore needed to be perfect!  I am not a fan of crispy PB cookies, so was looking for something moist & chewy, and these turned out be just that!    My modifications: (1) substitued butter for margarine                                  (2) added 1/2 tsp vanilla with the eggs                                  (3) decreased salt to 1/2 tsp                                  (4) added 1 pkg chocolate chunks  These have gone on the "repeat" list!

Loved it! I made a double batch of these using crunchy peanut butter. This recipe is a perfect balance of peanut flavor and sweetness. I put some in the freezer and we enjoyed the others right away. To get a crisp, crunchy cookie you MUST use cold or only slightly softened butter. Thanks!

This cookie recipe is AWESOME...the only changes I made was, I used one cup of butter flavored Crisco instead of the 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup margarine called for in the recipe and I used only 1 1/2 teaspoons full of baking soda...I also added a bag of mini chocolate chips to mixture...other than that, I followed recipe to a T....I flattened each cookie with a fork before I baked them and used a cookie scoop..baked cookies for 14 minutes per each cookie sheet...I was able to get 84 cookies total....I will DEFINITELY use this recipe over and over again when I'm wanting to bake Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies...you won't come up with a better recipe than this one...the cookies I baked turned out absolutely wonderful....Thank you soooo much for sharing this GREAT cookie recipe...it is a DEFINITE KEEPER for sure.

A very good cookie! Like many others, I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening and margarine. Also, I ended up using about a cup and a half of oats. Very tasty! If you're looking for a good chewy cookie with just the right amount of peanut butter flavor, this is it!

OMG!! I made these cookies because of the comments of another reviewer who said her husband does not like peanut butter cookies, but he liked these.  I love peanut butter cookies, but my husband does not, so...I thought, "Hmmm...I'll give it a try."  I took one bite and almost died.  My husband ate about 3 right out of the oven and another 3 later with a glass of milk.  I don't think the batch will last over 24 hours!  These are phenomenal!!

These are so tasty and yummy but mine came out pretty crumbly which made them a little difficult to move around. I added chocolate chips and m&m's which was a really good decision..made them more popular! Overall, play with the ingredients a little and I'm sure they can be made softer and less crumbly. A worthwhile recipe!

These have a nice taste, I just thought they were a little too dry and crumbly. The only thing I changed was to use butter instead of margarine because I don't use margarine at all. Thanks.

Wowy Wow WOW!  These are GREAT!  They taste great and are highly fragrant.  If, like me, you LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of peanut butter, you'll love making these.

Here is my hint:
-Keep a VERY close eye on these.  They brown VERY easily and you don't want to OVERBAKE them.  As soon as they start getting a little color and if the bottoms are already golden, plan on taking them out of the oven.

YUMMAYYYY!!!

I've made these twice now and they were a hit both time.  I rate this 4 stars as is.  Perfectly baked at 11 minutes in my oven.  Be sure to let the cookies cool well on the baking sheet before moving them to prevent crumbling.  I modified the recipe the second time, adding 1/2 cup more oats and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips...definitely boosted it to 5 stars!

I made these as a housewarming present for a friend. Not only are they tasty, but they look gorgeous. Nice crinkled tops. I followed the recipe word for word (for once) and they came out perfectly, I wouldn't change a thing. I am not a huge peanut butter cookie fan, but these are delicious!

These are my favorite cookies.  I did make some changes: I used butter rather than margarine, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I had some friends do a blind taste-testing of this batch both with natural peanut butter and regular peanut butter, and the regular peanut butter won.

Delicious!  The only change I made was to add an extra 1/2 C oatmeal.  I did have to press lightly with a fork before baking because they really do puff up and stay round.

I stumbled upon this recipe while searching for an oatmeal peanut butter cookie per my boyfriends request. I am so glad I did! This cookie has the perfect consistency and the flavor and texture were just what I was looking for! I did add more peanut butter, as I tasted the dough while raw, and wanted a slightly more peanut buttery taste. I also added additional oats so that the oats would be evenly distributed throughout the cookie. A delicious recipe worth making again and again!

I just finished making these cookies with my 9 yr old and the results are FABULOUS!  We made a few modification to suit our tastes:  Used all butter in place of shortening & margarine, and whole wheat flour.  Also added an extra 1/2 cup of natural peanut butter.  If you like your cookies soft and chewy, be sure to take them out at the 10 min. mark.  They'll still look doughy at first, but firm up when cooled.  YUM, YUM!

these cookies truly deserve 5 stars! they are soft, the right amount of sweet, easy to get together and a good choice even if you are in a hurry but want to make cookies all the same. Everybody loved them, and I can only add that in my home nobody likes peanut butter and they are very picky indeed...

These were decent - I will try again. I strongly recommend under-baking just a bit otherwise they get too dried out... I followed the recipe exactly - just adding in some reeses pieces, which gave an extra special peanut butter flavor!

These are very good.  Used "new" crisco and part real butter, part smart balance and they turned out very good.  You could chill the dough, roll into balls and fork-mark them, but they are quicker to drop as in the directions.  Only change:  I used 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 3/4 as someone else suggested and they were plenty sweet enough.  Also added 1 t. vanilla.

Great recipe! These will be my standard for pb cookies from now on, though I do double the amount of peanut butter. I also use a stick of butter instead of the shortening, just because that's what I had on hand the first time, and liked how it turned out.

This recipe turned out AMAZING!! By far the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. I had to make a few changes so I didn't have to go to the store...
I used 1 cup butter flavored crisco, 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1 cup crunchy PB, I added 1/2 more oats and added 2 cups of peanut butter chips. Yummy!!! My whole family is raving about them. I will definitely make these again. Thanks!

I am rating this as my third batch is cooking. These are THE BOMB!! I can honestly admit that I never bake anything because I am just not good at it. These are fool proof! They are warm and super soft on the inside and crispy on the outside! The only changes I made were: I used a whole stick of butter & I added a tsp of vanilla. Thats it! Oh, and I used Adams real natural peanut butter. I recommend these! I cooked them for 10 minutes and took them out to sit for 2 or 3 then put in a container...perrrfect!

mmmmm... so good! My husband doesn't really like Peanut butter cookies but he liked the light taste of peanut butter that these have.  I also modified the recipe after reading the reviews, I added more oats and put less flour in them.  I also added vanilla to them.  It gave it that flavor they were missing.

These are delicious. I made 1/3 of the batch exactly as the recipe called, 1/3of the batch with chocolate chips, and the rest with white chocolate. I thought that they were best with white chocolate, but they are still wonderful just the way the recipe calls for them.

These weren't the chewy, oatmealy cookies that I had imagined they'd be.  I knew this when I was finished mixing the batter because it was too wet and didn't have enough substance.  Because of this they spread very thin and were fairly crispy.  They had a very oily taste.  

I will definitely try this recipe again though.  I am SURE that with more oats added, these cookies would be chewier, less crunchy, and absorb some of the oil.

Give 'em a try!

This recipe produces a lighter-than-usual cookie that does make a nice change from the heaviness that one often finds in peanut butter cookies. The only issue is that the cookies don't seem to freeze well, and therefore cannot keep very long after baking.

So good, made exactly as recipe states except I added a t. of vanilla.  Next time I will use 1/2 t. of salt for personal preference.  These were perfect!

I made this recipe with 2 cups flour(1/3 of which was whole wheat), 1 Tbsp vanilla, 3/4 cup white sugar,and double the oats(I used old fashion oats).  I microwaved the butter until it was super soft and partially melted.  I rolled them into 1 inch balls and squashed them with a fork to 1/4 inch  thickness, then baked them until the edges appeared dry and the bottoms were light brown, about 8 minutes. They were terrific!  If you want a soft chewy cookie with more peanut butter flavor just don't add more oats or flour.

We didn't particularly enjoy these cookies. We usually devour cookies as fast as we can make them, but these ones remained untouched for a long time. I followed the recipe... so I guess maybe this is just a matter of taste preferences.

Made a few changes to this recipe. Used butter instead of margarine. Cut white sugar to 2/3 cup. Increased oats to 1-1/2 cups. Added vanilla, 1 cup chocolate chips, and 1 cup coarsely chopped peanuts.

Everyone really likes them.

I make these all the time, adding whatever I have in the pantry; chopped caramels, white chocolate chips, chocolate chips, whatever.  These cookies are addictive...and I probably shouldn't be making these so often or I'm going to be a house pretty soon.

I thought these were complex enough as is, so I didn't add chocolate or butterscotch as others have done.  I cut back on the white sugar, using only 1/2 cup and was very pleased with the final product.

This was the first recipe I used from this site about 7 years ago and for once I got it right the First Time!!  These are the ABSOLUTE BEST - LOOK NO FURTHER believe me it's pointless!  I always add vanilla (just cuz I like it) and usually add choc. chips for variety!

Great recipe! I used only half the recipe, and here are the changes I made so that it would fit my healthy lifestyle: I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening or marg. I used 1/2 cup of rapadura instead of sugar (real sugar cane crystals that have not been processed, so it has a dark color but great flavor and great nutrients), 3/4 cup of natural peanut (no hydrogenated oils), whole wheat flour, whole oats (not quick) and added 1/2 t. of vanilla. These cookies taste great- like peanut butter granola bars almost. Plenty of flavor and you don't have to feel guilty about eating these (unless you eat all of them yourself!!)

I'm not a peanut-butter cookie fan, but these were quite good.  And my husband loved them.  Best eaten a day or so after they are baked, in my estimation. (I used half a cup of whole wheat flour, just because I try to sneak it in whenever possible.) Next time I'd try old-fashioned oats instead of quickies.

Most excellent!  I used all butter instead of shortnening/margarine as a personal preference and they turned out delightful!  If you cook them just until they puff up then settle down, you get a nice chewy texture.  If you let them turn a light brown, you get a crisper (but still wonderful) cookie.  I had to let mine cool in the pan for a bit before I could remove them to prevent breakage.

Very good cookie!  I used all butter and added a bit more flour and oats than the recipe called for (maybe a 1/4 cup of each, I just added till the dough looked stable enough) because others said that they spread out too much, mine were perfect.  I always use parchment paper for baking cookies and I did leave them on the cookie sheets for a couple of minutes to set up or they will fall apart trying to take them off.  I only used a half teaspoon of salt after reading other reviews and I did use chunky peanut butter because that is what was open.

I'll admit, I was skeptical since I totally hate peanut butter cookies, but my husband and kids love them, so I decided to go ahead and give this recipe a try. The caption above the recipe claimed to have made her husband a fan, so I wondered if I would be one too afterwards. Well, she was right, this recipe is delicious, and I am most definitely a fan, and will be making AND EATING this totally delicious cookie again and again (much to the dismay of my bathroom scale). The only change I made to the recipe was to decrease the salt to 3/4 tsp. and I added 6 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips as per several other reviews. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe right along, and had fantastic results. Although after eating a few of these yummy cookies, I think I could have used the entire 1 tsp. of salt with no problem. These cookies are so good, everyone one of us are still raving about them! Thankyou so much!

OMG these cookies are phenomenal!! They are so soft, and very peanut buttery! I added vanilla extract & used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening...other than that, 
I made as recipe was written. My p.b. cookies usually turn out dry, but these are moist, soft and deliciously decadent! I did add some dark chocolate chips to my last tray of cookies, very rich! The recipe as stands is awesome! Thanks for this 5 star recipe!

These are great cookies and so easy. Different and the only thing I did was add choclate chips and a little vanilla- out of habit. I will make these again and again- they came out perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Excellent cookies.  I was worried they might spread a bit and I'm used to peanut butter cookies that you mark with a fork, so I tried that with the first batch.  I like them better without marks, and they don't spread much.  I might have used more peanut butter than called for because I just used up the remainder of a jar, but otherwise I stuck with the recipe.  Nice, fluffy, chewy cookies.

I followed the reviewers' tips...  used 1 3/4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats, 1 tsp vanilla essence, 1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter. I used butter instead of margarine and shortening, reduced white sugar to 1/4 cup and brown sugar to 3/4 cup (don't like my cookies sweet)and they taste really good. Melt in the mouth. I beat the butters and sugars till fluffy, and stirred in the flour mixture by hand. The cookies weren't flat... they were plump and looked just like the display photo. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Love it!

These are great!!!! I was never a huge fan of peanut butter cookies, but these have just the right crispiness, plus healthy oatmeal!  My husband - quite a cookie critic, says it is one of his favorite cookie recipes. I made these as Christmas gifts for our neighbors - a big hit. For anyone that gave them a bad review I just wonder what they did wrong. Very easy recipe! Some people like to cook and just "eyeball" their measurements, but when it comes to baking you should strive for accuracy. Maybe the people that had problems were guestimating on measurements?

If I could give this recipe 7 stars I would! These are just the best cookies! I just used cheap margarine, 1/2 chunky and 1/2 creamy peanut butter and cooked them just until they started to brown a little bit and then took them out and let them cool on the cookie sheet 5 minutes to finish developing. These are chewy and sweet but not too sweet and just Awesome! thanks for sharing your recipe...

These were good. Nothing terribly special. I added chocolate chips to half the batch. Cut back on the white suger, added more peanut butter (crunchy) and oats. And they needed to bake for about 15 minutes in my oven. I think the spiced oatmeal raisin cookies on this site are waaaaaay better, but these were good.

Really really really good.  I've made some bad cookies in my life and I needed a recipe that I didn't need vanilla.  I realized after creaming all the sugar and peanut butter (used unsalted butter instead of shortening & margarine) that I didn't have the oats, so I actually used 3 packets of instant flavored oatmeal and it still came out excellent!

Delicious cookies, just what we were looking for. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and brown sugar splenda and regular splenda for the sugars. I also added chocolate chips. Very quick and easy. The person we gave them to loved them as did my husband who keeps sneaking into the cookie jar for more.

Very good! I had to use self rising flour so I left out the baking soda and added a few pinches of salt. I would've put in vanilla, but I was out of that as well. I've made 2 batches, and each time it took 8 min. Just bake until the edges are starting to turn brow. The cookies stayed soft for several day in an air tight container.(If they last that long!)

so delicious. i used all chunky peanut butter cause i like the texture better, also i used one cup of oatmeal and one cup of muesli which added great flavor and texture! I also used only 3/4 cup of butter, and 1 1/2 cups of sugar, nearly all dark brown.  these were super tasty.  but make sure to let them cool so they keep their shape and don't fall apart

I was having a craving for a good cookie and these were yummy! I used 1 c. of salted butter (no shortening on hand) so I didn't add any additional salt, plus added about 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I took the rest to work with me to share and everyone loved them. Thanks Michele! Fabulous!

Very nice cookie but waay too much salt.  I think 1/2 teaspoon would be enough - wish I had paid attention to earlier reviews to catch that one. But still nice consistency - I added chocolate chips too.

These were quite tasty.  I used butter in place of the shortening and margarine.  I also added chocolate chips to half of the batch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I followed some of the other reviewers modifications;  Used 1 cup of butter, added 1 Tsp of Vanilla extract & increased oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups.  Next time, I think I will even go to 2 cups of oats.  Easy to make & yummy!

These were pretty good, a little chewier that I like. I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter, a little extra peanut butter, a little extra oats and couple handfuls of choc chips. My husband ate most of them :-)

I did not use shortening, substituted canola oil. They came out great. They were a big hit at Christmas, I gave them out as gifts. My husband is not a big peanut butter fan but he likes oatmeal and he loves these cookies. Thanks for a great recipe.

I just finished making these and had to give it an excellent review.  They were delicious.  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I used all butter, 1 1/4 c. crunchy peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, and just under 2 cups of oatmeal.  Also, I added some chocolate chips to about half of the dough.  With or without those, they tasted great.

I am not a big fan of peanut butter, but these cookies are excellent! I have made them for a couple of parties throughout the holidays and everyone asks me for the recipe. Many people who don't like peanut butter will like this recipe!   They are very soft and delicious! Definitely a good cookie for guests!

while I agree with some of the previous posts that this cookie is not very peanutty, I'm okay with it.  I'd say its not brimming with oatmeal either. I was wanting cookies but couldn't decide if I wanted oatmeal, peanut-butter or chocolate chip, this one cookie offered a sampling of all three.  I used butter flavored crisco, added a tsp of vanilla, and of course, chocolate chips.. and they turned out great.  Thanks for a perfect all around fix!

This cookie is by far the best peanut butter cookie I have ever made or tasted! I didn't have shortening on hand, so I used butter. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T... and the results were peanut-buttery, chewy, yummy cookies. The perfect compliment to a tall glass of milk.

These are really, really good. Mine where a little too soft, but that was because I used honey instead of sugar. They are so soft and chewy and HEAVENLY. My mom could not stop eating them. Well, she did get a sick stomach because of them, but she enjoyed them while she was eating them. Mine were a little too sweet, but this was probably because I didn't wasn't completely accurate with my honey conversion. The softness was a little annoying when I tried to get them out of the pan, but this time (I am making them now) I will put wax paper down first and maybe make them a little smaller. It wasn't a very big problem, cause I could smoosh the cookies back together if they broke! Definitely worth making.

came out excellent; i sent them out as thanksgiving goodies to my friends who live out of state and they loved them! they kept well for the 2 or so days they were in transit.. i think the oatmeal is what helps them stay so soft. I used all the modifications listed in the first review posted here [the very top one].. also, make sure you make them pretty big.. the smaller ones I made came out too hard, but the bigger were so soft and chewy.

These were awesome, the changes I made was used organic peanut butter and wheat flour and you would have never known they were a little healthier. I also made them as cookie bars and everyone just loves them.

I tried on three occasions to make this cookie for my stepson who is in the navy, unfortunately it never made it out of our house.  They were gone before I could pack them.  I have tried this recipe with low fat creamy Jiff and with the full fat Jiff with extra peanuts both seemed to work well.  The one with nuts seemed to make it a little more moist.  Could be the added oil in the regular Jiff.

I changed a few things to suit our tastes but overall this was a great cookie. A little sweet so I reduced both sugars by 1/4 cup (3/4 brown and 1/2 white. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 c wheat germ, 1 c semisweet choc chips and pressed mini m&m's into them after flattening slightly on the cookie sheet. I also added 1/2 c more oats and 1/2 - 1 c coconut and thus making the ultimate Monster Cookies!

Good cookie.(Pretty too) I used real butter and baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet for 12 minutes. I halved the recipe with perfect results- it made exactly 24. I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips to half of the batter and they are even better than the ones as written.

These are good! :) I only bake them for 7 minutes though, I wanted them to be chewy. Next time I'm going to try adding peanut butter chips.

Great recipe, I followed it exactly and got wonderful results! I made these for my mum, but once I took a bite... well, she only got half! The oatmeal gives it a superb texture. This is my staple peanut butter cookie recipe!

These cookies were delicious!  I love peanut butter cookies and oatmeal cookies, the two together are heavenly.  The only thing I did different was to add a little cinnamon.  New favorite cookie!

The family (Mum, Grandma, Grandad, Great Uncle and Uncle and myself) thought these were great.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions by adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla essence, eliminating the salt and slightly undercooking them.  They came out great, a little crunchy with a slightly softer middle.  I have never had a peanut butter cookie before, but I do agree with others who have said that it doesn't taste all that much like peanut butter, we loved them though.  Thanks.

These are wonderful!!!!! I slightly underbake mine which I think helps to keep them moist. I made them this past week and they quickly dissapeared.

The only thing I changed was that I added 1/2 more cup of oatmeal. This is one of my favorite peanut butter cookie recipes out there! I halved the recipe, but I won't be doing that from now on..I'm going to bake a lot more next time!

i made the previously reccommended changes (1.5 C peanut butter, 1.5 t baking soda, 2 C oats, vanilla, etc.). i made half the batch in this fashion and to the other half i added walnuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips. turned out quite nice. well enough to pass out as part of a holiday gift, but the cookies didn't blow my mind. 

solid recipe, though. was quick and made quite a few cookies.

Instead of AP flour, I used white stone ground whole wheat flour and demerara sugar instead of packed brown. I used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats and the cookies all came out perfect and delicious. Definitely a big hit with all four kids! Highly recommended.

This was fantastic!!! My 2 yr old helped me it was fast & easy and the cookies are melt in your mouth good!! I had one slight change in the recipe...I was out of regular shortning and margerine so I substituted 1 cup of butter flavored Crisco. I think that they couldn't have been better.

I have made this recipe before, but today I made them different, thanks to many of your suggestions! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour (and you couldn't even tell). I increased b. soda to 2 1/2 t., as suggested. I increased pb and oats. Also, I didn't have any margarine, so for that I substituted 1/4 c. oil, and 1/4 c applesauce. These cookies turned out beautiful and delicious. I ate as much cookie dough as I did cookies! Also, I added a bag of peanut butter m&m's and it made them SO GOOD. I'm not sure which of my alterations made them cook faster, but they only took about 5 1/2 minutes to bake. Watch em close cause these are WAY to good to burn!

Great cookie! Excellent taste. Peanut butter adds just enough change from the regular oatmeal cookie. I used old fashion oats and added about a cup of mini chocolate chips.

Great cookies, they are better the next day.  They are crispy but chewy, more like a bakery cookie.  My husband hates PB cookies, but loved these.

Ok I made these last night and left a review, but I had to leave another review. These cookies are great! I can't stop eating them! My cookies turned out very soft and chewy with a great PB taste. I have come to realize that most all cookies and cakes taste way better the 2nd day. I also left the previous review. Here's what I will do next time and recommend: add an extra teaspoon of baking soda ( I think it will help keep the cookies thicker), use chunky PB and possibly add some chopped peanuts, add an extra cup of oats for texture, and add a teaspoon of vanilla. But otherwise they are great the way they are. Will definitely make again!!! Oh yeah, keep cookies in a ziploc bag to keep them soft/chewy.

These cookies were wonderful. I made a few changes to lower the calories and fat. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, splenda in place of the white sugar and whole liquid egg in place of the two eggs. I also omitted the shortening and used an olive oil based margarine instead. They were a huge hit!

Good cookie overall.  Mine were too salty.  Would reduce the salt next time.  But, they had a beautiful shape and texture.  Maybe a bit more peanut butter would help.

These cookies are a breeze to make and are so delicious! My picky, picky 4 yr old LOVES them! Did I tell her oats are in the recipe!? I THINK NOT!      :)     They're tender crisp on the outside and oh-so-soft yummy in the center! I added 1/2c semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2c chopped peanuts to the dough. I will surely make these again! Thanks!

YUMMMYYYY!  I have been looking a long time for a "keeper" peanut butter cookie recipe - look no longer!  This is the best PB cookie I have ever made.  I have tried about 10 different ones, this one tastes strongly like peanut butter and is nice and chewy.  Great cookie, easy recipe. Try this one!

Wow! These were wonderful! Made these tonight and 1/4 of them are already gone! Yummy! I used 3/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and 1/4 cup of crunchy peanut butter. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I rounded my flour up to approximately 1 and 3/4 cup. For the shortening I used butter flavored shortening. Thanks for a yummy and fun recipe!

Pretty good cookie!  My peanut butter cookies usually get too brown or crumble; these don't.  They do get crunchy on the second day, but the flavor is wonderful.  Thanks for a good cookie!

These were just okay.  I was expecting a softer, chewier cookie, and I got more of a crisp one.  I am still looking for that soft melt-in-your-mouth peanut butter cookie!

I was careful not to overcook these.  I took them out when the appeared to be very doughy, but they still ended up really crispy instead of soft.  However, the flavor was very good.

A perfect cookie - soft and chewy.  I used butter instead of margarine and cooked them for 8 minutes and added chocolate chips. Yummmie!

This is the best p.b. recipe I've ever had.  Not only did they taste great but they were sooooo easy to make.  The only thing I changed was using crunchy peanut butter- I loved it.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again!

These were awesome! I'm surprised they made it off the cooling racks!  I was pleasantly surprised because I was expecting an oatmeal cookie w/peanut butter but the oatmeal wasn't overpowering.  The flavor was excellent.  I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c margarine because I didn't have any shortening.  I will definitely make these again, and with oatmeal and peanut butter involved I don't feel bad at all about giving them to my kids.

These are pretty oily, but tastier than usual peanut butter cookies. The oats give them a nice crunch. I made them smallish and put them together in pairs with grape jelly. Husband loved them!

This is one of those 10 star recipes--easy to make, wonderful taste and appearance.  The only changes I made were using butter instead of the margarine and adding 1 cup of mini chocolate chips.  My husband said they were "out of this world" and he is not usually a big cookie person.  For the people who thought they were too dry I would advise cooking for less time--I baked one batch for too long and they were dry the next day while the ones that weren't overbaked were chewy peanut buttery perfection! Anyone who likes peanut butter has to try these!

Very good -- basically a peanut butter cookie with more texture.  I subbed Splenda for the white sugar, and since I was using all natural peanut butter, I increased the Splenda a bit.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour and decreased it to 1-1/4 cup, but next time will use only 1 cup, since my cookies came out more cakey than I like.  I didn't increase the amount of oats.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Next time I'll use a full tsp, because cinnamon is delicious with peanut butter (I once bought cinnamon raisin peanut butter, and it was to die for!).

I was a bit skeptical at first, but this turned out to be an excellent cookie recipe.  It really blew people away!  

I substituted butter for margarine and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also added chocolate chips to half the recipe, and chocolate and peanut butter chips to the other half.  I was afraid that the peanut butter chips would make the peanut butter taste too strong, but they were actually a delicious complement, with the chocolate, to the peanut butter already in the recipe.  I'm going to be making these again right away!

This is a really good peanut butter cookie recipe, but it needed something.  I added choc chips to the last half of the batch before baking and they got a bit more moisture but lost some peanut butter flavor.  Next time I'll try vanilla.  Better than most recipes i've tried.

Just pulled the last pan out of the oven but started eatting from the first I pulled out. This is a keeper for sure. I did use a little less bakin soda and a little less salt for I thought it called for to much.I also used all butter and no shorting.

Do not listen to past reviews that claim this is not a good recipe. All I can say is that they must of not followed the directions or they just can't bake. I did pat down the first batch before placing them in the over but wished I had not, for it made them to thin. Just use the drop spoon method, and use a good size drop. I like big cookies so the next batch I will double, for by making fatter cookies this amount only made 3 dozen.

I'm sure the original recipe is great, but I always do a little changing for my tastes. Used whole wheat flour, substituted the shortening & margarine for 3/4 cup butter (to avoid trans fat), and left out the white sugar. Great taste. Next time I'll try to substitute applesauce for most of the butter, and put even less sugar in.

To sum it up, they're just ok.  I make TONS of cookie recipes, and this is just an average cookie. There are much better PB cookie recipes out there...!  There's nothing wrong with the taste of these cookies, but there's nothing special about them. Definitely add more peanut butter...oh well. I'll stick to my tried and true PB recipe. Thanks anyway!

Unbelievable recipe!  Texture was bakery perfect.  Golden crisp on the outside...soft and chewy in the middle.  Only change I made was using real butter in place of shortening and margarine.  Plus I added milk chocolate chips and chopped pecans.  Really a wonderful taste.  I will use this recipe as a base for many, many cookies in my life.  It's so easy to add different ingredients to create a unique taste.  Thank you for this treasure!

Perfect. After making this I threw out my recipe for regular pb cookies. I used all butter instead of shortening, and they were no different for the change. Moist and delicious.

Nice texture!! I used 1/2 crunchy and 1/2 creamy peanut butter but other then that I stuck to the recipe, and they turned out great.  I did not drop them but did the standard peanut butter cookie "x" and undercooked them just a little and they stayed soft even after they cooled. I definatly recommend this recipe!!

Yes, this cookie had it going on!  A hit with everyone that had it.  I have elininated hydroginated oils from my diet, so i used i cup of butter intead of the margarin or shortning.  I also used the "old fashion" style peanut butter to bring out the true peanut butter taste (also didnt want those hydroginated oils). It was a little buttery but very good.  If you like peanutbutter and oatmeal, then give this one a whirl!

The cookies tasted good while they were warm but after cooling off they weren't so great. Recommend if you use this recipe eat them while they are still warm.

This recipe was excellent after a few alterations. I added vanilla, 1/2 cup of coconut and 1 cup of butterscotch chips to the recipe. I also had to add 1 extra cup of oatmeal to the batter.

I find I need to add A LOT more oatmeal to keep them together, like up to 3 cups.  I also add a teaspoon of vanilla, and chocolate and butterscotch chips.  Very good cookies!

These were VERY good.  I don't usually like peanuat butter cookies (and that's why I make them -- so I don't eat them) but these were light on the "peanutty" flavor.  I also added a few drops of vanilla (what's a cookie without vanilla in the mix?) and chocolate chips.  My kids and hubby gobbled them up quick.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanx!!!

It was a good cookie, but the oatmeal was certainly not center stage in this one.  More like a peanut butter cookie with oatmeal.  I easily doubled the oatmeal without complaints.

My husband loves peanut butter,especially in cookies I made these and added some butterscotch chips. They were yummy, and everyone raved about them. Let them sit for a few seconds before you remove them from the cookie sheet. I also use the insulated sheets, they looked as good as they tasted. Thanks Michele.

I have made this recipe several times. But, the last time that I made them I used 1/2 t. of salt instead of 1 t. Peanut butter is already salty, and this really helped it. This is the recipe that I will use when making peanut butter cookies! Very good! Thanks Michele!

These were great cookies...I have four kids and they ate them up! My husband ate more than the kids did. I made very few changes. I used all butter flavored crisco and I put in a 1/2 bag of vanilla chips. I also decreased the salt. They were so yummy....I will make these again soon!

These were pretty good. I made one batch with chocolate chips and one with out and I have to say that the chocolate chips made a big difference . The family loved them.
I think i will add vanilla next  time for more flavor. I also added a 1/2 cup of crunch peanut butter for a nutty flavor. 
Will make again thank you for the recipe !

These were the best peanut butter cookies we have ever had.  The others always had "something" missing....it was the oatmeal!  I scaled this to 72 cookies and it came out perfectly even in my never the right temp oven.  Thanks so much it is now a family favorite.

These have become my absolute favorite cookies!  I make them again and again, sometimes as-is and sometimes adding chocolate chips, M&M's, chopped peanuts, or chopped white chocolate pieces. Really an excellent recipe - a keeper!

We loved this cookie! I added a bit of vanilla. I even added chocolate chips and baked as cookie bars. This is a definite keeper!

I'm anxious for Dh to get home and try these! He doesn't like pb cookies either - but these are fabulous!
I sub'd...1 c sucanat for the brown sugar, white wheat flour for the all purpose flour, and oat flour (not rolled oats) for the oatmeal, and I added 1 tsp vanilla (I add vanilla to just about everything!). These cookies are fabulous! I also used Brummel and Brown margarine and natural peanut butter so that I have no trans fats in my cookies! :) Thanks for a great recipe! - Sharon

I was looking for a quick cookie to make today...we have been tryen atleast 3 new recipes a week from this site. Well..kids were wanting cookies..so i just grabbed this recipe..looked quick and easy. I've made alot of cookies..and i have to say..this is one of my favorite. Was not even expecting it..lol. I did not have any shortening..so i used a full cup of margarine instead.  I dont think   next time i will even try the shortening...since i liked these sooo much. They are so soft..taste great..and come out of the oven looking real nice. They are everything u think a peanut butter cookie should be:)

I am not big on Oatmeal or Peanut Butter cookies but I love these. They are chewy and delicious!  Even my daughter, who is not a cookie fan, ate these.  They are the best!

THE BEST Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies and possibly one the best cookie I make!  I add about 2 cups of oatmeal to increase the fiber and dryness/crunchiness of this cookie, and I can't keep them in the house for long.  A REAL WINNER!

This recipe combined the oatmeal my husband loves with the peanut butter that
my daughter loves into one cookie.  Great taste, not too dry, and the ease of a
drop cookie made this recipe very popular with my family.  A real KEEPER!

Yes thanks Michelle ... delicious.  My husband doesn't care for 'regular' peanut butter cookies either.  Unlike others I added peanuts to the batter.  But I have to agree additions aren't necessary!

This cookie is heavenly. Since I don't like salty cookies I made the recipe with unsalted butter and used less than a half teaspoon of salt. They came out perfect. Like others I found 15 minutes too long. On air-bake cookie trays, I found 12 minutes to be perfect.

One of the best PB recipes I have tasted!  I used butter instead of margarine and reduced the baking time to 10 minutes.  Perfect!  I did find that it makes more than 4 dozen cookies, which is okay since it will give you more to eat.  I used a 1 1/2 inch diameter cookie scoop (highly recommended to use for any cookie recipe) and got about 7 dozen cookies.  I agree with the reviewer who said it is hard to eat just one!

They should rename this cookie "Danger Cookies" because if they are in the house you will be in danger of eating too many.  They were the wonderful.  I cooked them only about 9 minutes.  I used regular oats and added about 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Wow!

I loved these cookies and so did my family. Just the right amount of peanut butter flavor.  I did use real butter and added a teaspoon of vanilla flavor. This will replace my old peanut butter cookie reicpe.

Okay, you know I couldn't leave it alone. I agree that it had too much fat but if you add that much, just add a bit more flour. I added 1C semisweet mini chips, 1/2C milk chocolate small chunks, 1/2C plumped raisins. The kids don't even notice the raisins when you plump them. Also I couldn't taste too much of the peanut butter...but that is right out of the oven. Maybe in the morning it will be different. Oh I also added 1tsp heaping 
cinnamon and 1/2t nutmeg. Maybe a touch of clove would be nice too.

These are wonderful cookies!!  An addictive combination of peanut butter and oatmeal... yummy!!  Try throwing in a 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips and a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.. makes them truly delicious!  A keeper for sure!!

You gotta try this recipe!  My family loved them!  The cookies are delicious~ chewy inside and a little crunchy on the outside!  I realized after I started mixing the ingredients that I didn't have any oatmeal, so I used 2 1/2 packets of maple/brown sugar instant oatmeal and I think they turned out even better than the regular!

I forgot the eggs and added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and the cookies turned out wonderful.  I thought they would not sick together, but can't express just great these cookies were.  It was a great family project.  the kids really enjoyed the process and the product.  Thank You

these are delicious! I didn't quite have enough butter (I dont use margarine) but they were still perfect. I used crunchy peanut butter and I also added about a half teaspoon of vanilla and i didn't use as much sugar as it calls for. definitely making these again!

Made them for my husband for Valentine’s Day and he liked them a lot. I followed some reviews and made some changes - used 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of the shortening and margarine, added 1/2 more cup of PB, and 1 more cup of oatmeal. With those changes, the recipe made 36 cookies. 12 of them I added chocolate chips :)

Freakin' delcious! I read the reviews, so I added a tsp of vanilla and a little more oatmeal - like 1.5 cups instead of 1 cup. Oh, and I used butter, not margarine.

I didn’t have shortening so instead I used mixture of  coconut oil, clarified butter, peanut butter. Other than that I don’t think I replaced or substituted anything and voila crunchy cookies!  A keeper and hence next time peanut butter cookies may get some hint of other nuts, what do you think.

Used all butter instead of shortening and butter; reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup; added approx.  1/3 cup chocolate chips and baked at 350 on super convection (Breville Smart Oven Air) for 10-11 minutes.
Best peanut butter cookie recipe yet!  This recipe will replace our current pb cookie recipe.

I would definitely make these again.... I changed out the margarine for butter (I don't like using margarine at all in anything) and note to self my oven doesn't seem to heat as well as others so I would leave them in for the full 15 mins even a couple mins longer... this recipe made 6 doz nice sized cookies....very yummy no tastes overpowered the other just the right amount and mix of ingredients!!!

These are very good! I made half the recipe and followed the suggestions from CARIST. I added 1/4 c extra of flour for my half recipe. I also did not use the extra 2 tbsp of white sugar that the recipe calls for half the recipe to reduce the sugar per CARIST suggestion. I baked them for exactly 10 minutes each batch. They came out very good.  My personal suggestion relates to the kind of peanut butter you use for the recipe. If you use the sugar free kind, the cookies may taste a bit salty if you reduce the sugar. So my recommendation would be not to reduce the sugar if using sugar free peanut butter. If using regular sugared peanut butter, go ahead and reduce the sugar a bit. Also, you definitely need to add a bit more flour to prevent flat outcomes and the rule of thumb is always bake cookies in a cold cookie sheet. If you fear they may still come out flat, mix the oils cold not at room temperature this includes the peanut butter for this recipe. I prefer the combo of unsalted butter and shortening for my cookies always if the recipe calls for shortening+margarine combo.  Also, for safety I tested one cookie first while I kept the rest of the dough in the fridge. With all these suggestions, you should have nice round golden cookies that are not over baked.

I was excited to make this because I love peanut butter and so I thought the oatmeal would be fun. It just turned out bland. Not rich like a peanut butter cookie. It just needs something else like chocolate chips or nuts or something. I love cookies so they were still eaten but I won’t make these again.

Ok as is but it needed 1/2 cup more peanut butter, less salt and another 1/2-3/4  cup oatmeal. Not peanutty enough as is nor  enough oatmeal . Also added a tsp vanilla second time I made them. Very good with the changes, a little bland with out.

I used 1 C butter instead of 1/2 C shortening and 1/2 butter.   Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly .  The cookies were slightly salty so I will make sure to use 1/2 C UNsalted butter instead of the shortening next time.  Even with the slight saltiness, the cookies are wonderful.  Great recipe!

I’m not a big peanut butter fan, but these cookies were delicious! I did make a few personal changes to the recipe. I highly suggest you not omit the shortening. I know it’s bad for you, but it’s worth it for this recipe. I used less sugar and real butter. I also put a little extra oats in it....maybe 1/2 cup more.
I highly suggest adding white chocolate chips and pecans. It made them taste 10 times better, but that’s a personal preference. Great recipe! I made with and without the white chocolate/pecans.

The only thing I didn't use was baking soda because I didn't have any and they still turned out amazing the only thing I think I would change is maybe adding more oatmeal to it. Otherwise would definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious! I used dark brown sugar and natural peanut butter. I needed to add more oatmeal because natural PB is pretty wet at room temperature, and threw in some chocolate chips. They turned out great!

the only thing I ever change is using butter instead of margarine because I always have butter on hand.  these cookies are amazing and quickly became our favorite peanut butter cookie.  I'm going to try them with chocolate chips now that I've read it in the reviews, but they're excellent on their own.

I followed another reviewers suggestion to use butter instead of margarine+shortening, and also added 1/2 cup more oats than the recipe called for. These turned out not only delicious, but also beautiful! I’m saving this one for sure. I added chocolate chips to a few cookies as well.

Love these! Not a big fan of traditional peanut butter cookies but love these.  Crispy and a bit chewy. Yum......Made them with margarine - no shortening as not a fan of shortening.  They spread lots so leave room on the pan.

Excellent recipe! I used butter in place of margarine/shortening (I usually do), and I was so glad to see that the cookies didn't spread too much. Often, when butter is subbed in, the cookies spread out more. These were perfect. Great flavor, great texture. I used a bit more oats because I didn't measure those very carefully. I think the recipe is flexible on the oats quantity. Mine took about 12 minutes and are approximately 3-inches in diameter.

Although I intend to follow recipe exactly, in practice, I most often fall short, and at least have to list some tweeks or substitutions.     Not today. From now on, when baking peaniutbutter cookies,  I will always substitute half the butter requirement with the porky lard stuff commonly used here in Baja California. It looks like shortening anyway.  These cookies good not be better. The melt in your mouth soft texture achieved by slightly under-baking. Rich Peanut butter explosion on my taste buds with  a slight nod to oatmeal as an after taste. Yummy!!!!

My go to cookie when I think of peanut butter cookies.  The PB and shortening make these a very moist and tasty cookies, not to mention the addition of mini M&Ms and mini chocolate chips.

I used all butter instead of margarine and shortening. Worked very well. The best peanut butter cookies I’ve ever made!

I substituted butter for the shortening and margarine. Cut the sugar by a quarter cup, used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking, and added about a half-cup of chopped roasted peanuts. They were AWESOME! Will absolutely make them again.

Easy to make, fantastic to taste. I used crunchy peanut butter for a little extra texture. Even saved a few larger ones for ice cream sandwiches. Will definitely make this recipe again.

These were really nice cookies to make, they were really nice cookies to eat. I would prefer a bit more peanut butter in them so next time I might substitute some of the butter for more peanut butter.

Very VERY good! And ALSO I discovered at trick if you burn the cookie bottoms slightly: take a zester -like for lemons - and over the sink, run it along the bottom of the slightly burnt cookies. Voila! You’ve microshaved of all all the burnt parts so they’re perfect now.

I don't bake desserts often, mainly just for holiday dinners, and even then, almost ever cookies.  But got the munchies the other night and had all the ingredients on hand so made these exactly as directed.  

This made a lot of cookies.  I might cut it in half next time but it was nice to have extras to give to a couple of friends and neighbors.  

Fantastic cookies.  Before the leftovers went stale I scooped some vanilla ice cream on them to make ice cream sandwiches and wrapped them in cling wrap and froze them.  It's worth making these cookies just for that in my opinion.

(Photo is just a fraction of the total output.)

My son was asking me for peanut butter cookies so I opted for this oatmeal version. I followed the recipe exactly. I did Change the way I put them on the pan, instead of using a teaspoon I rolled them into mini golf balls (this made 2 dozen). Other than that they were great, but I do wish they had a bit more of a peanut butter flavor but I’ll probably fix that by adding a little more peanut butter next time or use chunky peanut butter.

This is a very tasty and beautiful cookie just as is. Everyone that tweeked theirs should have made your own post with your recipe. To promote your version was disrespectful to the original poster and I pray it doesn't discourage her from posting other great recipes.

These are delicious as the recipe is written, but adding a cup of chopped dry-roasted peanuts takes them over the top. For those whose cookies came out too salty - different brands of peanut butter have different levels of salt; some have no added salt. Taste your peanut butter before deciding whether you need the entire amount of salt called for in the recipe.

Very good cookies. I lowered it to 3/4 cup butter and 1/3 cup white sugar, and used a bit over 1.5 cups of quick oats. It came out to be 36 palm-sized cookies (plus whatever my brother ate from the bowl).

This is by far, the best peanut butter/oatmeal cookies ever! I am not a "baker". I don't do well when it comes to baking. I made this recipe by hand; no mixer involved. I just made sure I blended the ingredients very well. They came out sooo delicious and soft. The review that said, "don't change a thing" was right. The review that said, "had an odd after taste" I don't know what they were talking about. I was going to add chocolate chips and mini marshmallows but opted to just do the recipe as is. Maybe next time?

My family and I devoured these cookies, even those who never liked other peanut butter cookie recipes I've tried previously! This recipe was perfect as is, but I did add 2-3Tbs. of Bourbon maple syrup we'd gotten for a gift, which added a subtle yet delectable flavor. I mixed in milk chocolate chips to half the batch since some prefer them that way; and left the other half plain so that everyone was HAPPY!

These are very yummy but they were too oily for me. Next time I will only use half the amount of fats. I also subbed the shortening and margarine with all butter. (Who really uses shortening and margarine anymore? Yuck.) The peanut butter has a ton of fat in it already so I don't think all those extra fats are needed. I also added a bit of vanilla. The taste is really good though, I love the oatmeal in these. I baked for 12 mins and they were perfect.

I'll definitely make this again. Substituted an equal amount of butter for shortening and margarine. Next time, I will also reduce the amount of oatmeal used or increase the amount of peanut butter. 

Overall, satisfied with this recipe!

I will definitely make this cookie again and again!

These are the best peanut butter/oatmeal cookies I’ve ever had!! I also used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and margarine, and the flavor is stunning!!!

I used olive oil instead of the shortening and butter. Also used 1 tsp of Baking Soda and ¼ tsp of Baking Powder.  Found I needed to cut the salt in half as well.  

 Cooking times were 10 minutes and the cookies came out great

Great cookies! I used all (salted) butter, half crunchy and half creamy peanut butter, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, and a 10 oz bag of peanut butter chips. I went just a bit light on the tsp of salt to compensate for the additional salt in the butter. I like the taste and texture so much better than the standard pb cookies I had made previously. 13 minutes was just right in my oven.

Brilliant recipe!!  These were delicious!!  I added Reses peanut butter chips to them which added even more pb flavor.  I'll definitely make these again, but I'll cut the sugar a bit.

I used 2 1/2  cups of oatmeal and no flour so I could share with a friend who is gluten free.  I also did not have enough shortening so just added extra peanut butter to make up the difference. These are fantastic cookies!

Wonderful cookies!  They have become our absolute favorite!   I sub butter for the shortening and margarine, add an extra 1/2 c oats, and add some chocolate and even some peanut butter chips.  Also reduce white sugar to 1/2 cup.  Delicious!

I have made these several times.  My friends and family love them.    Sometimes i leave out the oatmeal, and add a bag of chocolate chips AND a bag of peanut butter chips.  Either way, they are delicious.

I search of recipes that modify well for my picky peeps, as well as those with food sensitivities.  I swapped in applesauce for the eggs this time, 1/4 cup per egg so half a cup of applesauce.  I also substituted 1/2 cup salted butter for the shortening, so my intense vegan friends would hold their noses, but that means more for us, lol.  Oh yeah, used peanut butter chips, too. 
 I am also an experimental 420 baker.  The recipe as I made it  yielded sixty (60)  1oz  "cookies" .   I  baked them in foil cupcake liners  (portion control) on a regular cookie sheet  at 350F for  14 mins, rotating the pan halfway through.  The result was incredible.  They look like little tarts; the tops sunk in, creating a well for just about anything you want to serve it with,  a chocolate kiss, a drizzle of caramel...
Making them again today, as the initial batch was snatched up and carried away by field-testers, lol.

I used 1/2 cup of canola oil instead of 1/2 cup shortening. I also used 3 eggs instead of 2. They baked for 9 minutes at 350. The cookies turned out great! This will be my new "go to" cookie recipe!

OH my goodness. Great cookie. I chopped 3/4cup of peanuts and accidentally over baked. They were very brown. OMG. These were great. A very light crunchy cookie. My family likes the btown ones better than the soft ones. You can really taste roasted peanuts. I have an air bake cookie sheet so they won't burn, just gets very brown. Thanks for this recipe.
PS. Don't store soft cookie with crunchy or they will all be soft.

I followed the recipe using Pillsbury Gluten Free flour.  I added some raisins (1 small box) and chocolate chips (about 1/3 cup). My rating  is a 5 only if I cannot detect any difference in taste of texture.  These are pretty good but not exactly like the real thing.

I baked mine in paper cupcake liners to get a thick and moist cookie. They were great! I didn’t really alter the original recipe, just added vanilla flavoring and some milk chocolate chunks. These were hard to resist and everyone enjoyed them.

Very good cookies not to much peanut flavor. They stayed soft and the oatmeal flavor was a little bit stronger the next day. Would make again.

I made I think almost exactly to recipe except to add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, an extra 1 cup of oats, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and a 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I was going to use these to make ice cream sandwiches so wanted them a little sturdier.   

I used a #20 scoop (a little smaller than 1/4 cup) and had to smoosh them down half way through cooking with a floured fork as they didn’t spread at all. Even using my medium scoop these ended up huge. They’re larger than my palm and quite thick. Haven’t tasted them yet as they’re cooling but the dough was tasty.

Mmmmmmmm the PERFECT cookie, only change is to use all butter, also made with freshly ground whole wheat flour, but I don’t consider that a change because it’s still flour and that’s all we use, only very rarely does it make a difference, in fact it adds flavor. Don’t be put off by the bad reviews, I’m wondering why I waited so long to make them. ten minutes bake time was exact for our oven.

This recipe is MAGIC. Don’t tinker! Chill in fridge if the dough gets too warm before baking. The second time I made these, I added mini chocolate chips, so withheld 1/4 cup of white sugar to maintain a balance between sweet and salty. (Yes, these are a wee bit salty at the finish, probably the secret to this recipe’s greatness.)

Am I the only one who thinks they're a bit too greasy?  I don't like to see grease left behind on the parchment paper when the cookies are done, and they "feel greasy" as well.  I followed another reviewer's advice and increased the flour by 1/4 C. and the oats by 1/2 C.  I followed the recipe, otherwise, with Crisco and butter.  I'm thinking I could still add more flour next time.  The flavor is good.

I doubled this recipe. About halfway through I realized that I needed to get the bigger mixing bowl out of the cabinet. I did not make any other changes to the recipe. They turned out really good. This is my first time making cookies from scratch, and I learned that the type of cookie sheet and the rack position in the oven can make a big difference in how the cookies turn out. I prefer the chewiness that I got from a bright aluminum cookie pan on the middle oven rack. And I used the standard bake setting because I have not taken the time to learn how to use the convection bake.

I used butter instead of margarine and shortening and gluten free flour. I had to take them out of the oven after 8 minutes because the bottoms were getting too well done. The flavour is a bit plain, I would recommend adding chocolate chips for extra yum!

I use butter instead of margarine.  Coconut oil instead of shortening. Sugar in the raw instead of white sugar and an extra cup of peanut butter for more peanut butter flavor.  I add a dash of pure vanilla extract and a teaspoon of cinnamon. The cinnamon gives it a great surprise flavor without tasting it. I use chunky peanut butter to give texture with the nuts. They come out delicious and perfect each time with everyone asking for more.

Good tasting cookie. I used 2x the oats and 1 cup butter instead of shortening and margarine. No salt because I only had salted butter on hand and added a dash of vanilla based on other reviews. Would make again.

Great cookie. Great batter!  I did add a bit more flour, a splash of vanilla, cinnamon, and a bit more oats.  The batter seems too wet and sticky, but bakes up wonderfully.  I only had old fashioned oats, so I pulled them in the food processor until they were smaller to be closer to quick oats.

I wanted something different than the usual peanut butter cookie, so I tried these, and they were perfect! I made them a bigger size, so I also had to bake them longer, but otherwise they tasted exactly like I wanted. Some people complained of an aftertaste, which I had with one batch, but I realized that comes from either underbaking, or overbaking, so as long as you know when they're done, they taste amazing! I definitely would recommend this recipe. Definitely use all real butter though, that's very important to the flavor.

made these gluten free and it worked well.  i used the bisquik glutten free backing mix,(and did not add backing soda or salt) in the measure for flour.   I used (~2)glutten freeda maple flavored oatmeal packets  - these packet have like no sugar) and did every thing else the same, except i used crisco butter flavored shortening and country crock "spread"(because that is what i had)   the mix makes a lot of cookies more than the prescribed 48 when you make them about 2-2.5 inch  some of mine were soft at first but they were all crispy soon after they cooked.   might try adding some apple sauce next time.  they look the same they did not need parchment

I am not even going to pretend I followed this recipe to the letter, because I didn't. I used it as a starting point. 

I took the suggestion of one person and reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp. Next, I had about 2/3 cup of leftover topping for apple crisp (which contained butter, white sugar, flour and cinnamon) and threw it into the batter. So, I reduced the flour to one cup. The flour I ALWAYS use for cookies is white whole wheat pastry flour. I didn't use shortening or margarine; I use only butter in my baking, always. I used DARK brown sugar; this contains more molasses in it. I reduced the amount of white sugar because of my apple crisp topping. I used the full amount of peanut butter, but I used organic all-natural peanut butter with no added salt or sugar. I used 2 eggs like the recipe calls for. Since I had an abundance of fat in there (2 sticks of butter, plus the oil from the peanut butter), I was able to add much more oatmeal, about 3 cusps worth. 

In addition, I added about a tsp. of vanilla, and probably an extra 2 teaspoons of cinnamon (I didn't measure these).

For 18 of the cookies, I had Hershey's kisses I placed on top after baking. I baked them on the temp according to the recipe for about 10 minutes. Any more than that and they would have been way overdone.

So, after all of that, the cookies turned out pretty good. They were "puffy" as they were baking, but settled down after cooling. They still are not as flat as the picture though. But they are decent

Awesome cookies. I used old fashioned oats, not quick oats. I used crunchy peanut butter, not creamy. Everybody loved these!

Currently baking more of these, I used Nutella in place of peanut butter and added a cup and a half of Skor toffee chunks. Best cookies I've ever made!

Good PB cookie option!  I love both BP and oatmeal, so to have them combined is a great cookie, in my opinion.  I always stick to the recipe, first time around, before adjusting.  I did flatten them on the pan, similar to PB cookies, but they spread too thin.  I will definitely make again!!

Excellent cookies! I did swap the margarine for butter and I added 1 cup chocolate chips. Mine took 15mins to bake. Really great cookies and easy to make.

Fantastic! Definitely will make again. I used unsalted butter instead of what the recipe called for, and did not use any added salt (low sodium household) and they are prefect!

Thanks for sharing this recipe. I live in hi-altitude (5500), so baking is a real challenge for me. These turned out nice! I used half gluten free flour (Nameste) and more brown sugar than white.  Will def make again, and add some choc chip. .

Absolutely delicious.  I thought the whole wheat flour would affect the taste, but not at all.  They were way better than I had expected and my husband loved them.

Great cookies!  Nice change from the traditional peanut butter cookie.  The oatmeal gives the cookie texture, but doesn't overwhelm the peanut butter taste.

One thing I changed was the shortening and used coconut oil it was not melted down but the same consistency as shortening. It adds great flavor and I like to do this when ever it is fitting. The peanut butter was delicious with the oatmeal and yes I will make it again!

I made these for the first time today. Only changes I made were to add about 1/4 cup more flour, (because I live in a higher elevation) and a teaspoon of vanilla. I loved that these were drop cookies, without the hassle of shaping and rolling etc. They turned out great, in all respects, tender and crispy on the outside, just a bit chewy on the inside, nice peanut butter flavor, and the oats just put them over the top. They taste very much like the do si dos the Girl Scouts sell, without the cream in the middle. I have just found my new peanut butter cookie recipe. Thank you!  Oh, I found that ten minutes was the perfect amount of time to bake them, any more and they'd have been dry and powdery. Can't imagine leaving them in for as long as fifteen. I, too, kept the batter in the fridge when not in use.

I really like the combo of oatmeal & peanut butter. I added raisins, and used crunchy peanut butter.. and I always use real butter, not margarine, and whole oats instead of quick oats.

This recipe is perfection! Chewy and moist with slight crisp. I used all butter because I did not have shortening on hand. Also added 3/4 cup extra oats based on reviews. Even if you don't like peanut butter cookies you will love these! Happy baking....

I was craving peanut butter and oatmeal when I stumbled on this recipe.  Super easy to make and turned out amazing!  I didn’t have quick oats, so I used steel cut and the cookies turned out just fine.  Only change was that I added a splash of vanilla extract.  Highly recommend this recipe and am adding it to my recipe box!

Easy quick recipe- 
I used 1 cup butter instead, added a bit more peanut butter ( about 1/3 cup more) and only used brown sugar  -1  & 1/4 cup packed ( total).
I added 1 tlb vanilla.
I heaped my one  cup of oatmeal as I enjoy the taste and texture of a good "soft in the middle " cookie!
These are just that.

I've made this recipe twice. Once as directed and once with slight modifications. Both were great. For the mods on the second batch, I used 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, regular butter, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Both were good.

Very simple recipe with lots of flavor.  My boys love peanut butter so I added a tad bit more.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips(I was craving chocolate) and added extra oats like the other reviewers suggested.  Soft and chewy just how I love my cookies.

I just finished backing them;  I added the *added touch* chocolate chips suggested by Michelle.  It is a nice different recipe from the peanut butter cookies I used to make which were great but from now on, I am sold on this one....It sure has a nice crunch to it which I think is related to the oatmeal.  Way to go Michelle.  Thanks for posting this one.

This almost got one star.  Way too much salt!  Yuck!  They are edible but even my toddler that loves cookies only took one bite and didn't ask for a cookie again.  They look pretty, I just wasted my time and ingredients.  If you make them then skip or reduce the salt!

Amazingly tasty! I deviated from the recipe this way:
*cut down to 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 was too salty for my tastes
*added 1 cup of chopped dried apples mmmm

Yes I made a little change, I used 1/4 cup of honey instead of the white sugar. They came out excellent, the baking time was 15 minutes and they are delicious. Thank you for the recipe

Great cookie with lots of peanuty taste. I used all butter and no shortening. I think the oats give this cookie a great texture.

Id give it 10 stars if i could. made half recipe but forgot to cut oatmeal. I used 1 1/2 cups. I converted to gluten free. for half recipe used 3/4 c gluten free rice blend flour and added 3/4 tsp xanthum gum. loved this recipe. rice blend flour is lighter in taste than all purpose flour otherwise converts easily.

I used less oats and added dark chocolate chips.  I did not pack the brown sugar and only used 1/2 a cup of sugar.  I think I will substitute 1/2 a cup of coconut oil for the shortening next time.  Good cookies!

I used 3/4 C brown sugar I like them to be a little less sweet and for a crispy cookie no crisco or margarine substitute 1 C butter.  I also dipped  1/2 cookie in dark chocolate to make a half moon cookie.  Great recipe supper yummmy!

Great recipe! I think the shortening gives it a very flaky finish. I made some adjustments though. I ended up using tahini instead of peanut butter (needed to use it up), using 1 and a 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, 1 and a 1/2 cups of steel cut oats (I like the texture...a bit crunchier), 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 a cup of butter, 1/4 cup of margarine and 1/4 cup of shortening. The tahini (ground sesame seeds) is more bitter than regular peanut butter if you compare it plain but in the cookie, you don't notice. I do agree with increasing the flour because even with the extra half a cup, it still spread (tahini is also runnier). Also, I found that 15 minutes was a good time. Definitely a recipe I'll keep!

Very tasty cookies!  I used only salted butter,  extra oats, vanilla, and 3/4 cups dry roasted salted peanuts that I chopped and added with the oats.  I omitted the extra salt.  I kept my dough in the fridge so the cookies would not flatten.  A new favorite at my house!!

As is im sure this is a winner! I made it vegan so everyone in my house could eat this. I subbed coconut oil for all the fat, added 2 containers of apple sauce no sugar added and upped the baking soda to 1 tbs. As suggested I upped the oats to 2 cups.

Good cookies. Mine spread so much though, they were very thin. Gave this 3 stars because I made cookies with popular recommendations, including increasing oats to 2 cups. Also added 1 cup choco chips to half the batter, which wasn't nearly enough chips.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and these cookies came out perfect!  I doubled the batch and froze a couple dozen dough balls for easy cookie making in the future.  I added a couple of handfuls of mini-chocolate chips to a few batches and those came out delicious also.  I'll definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe exactly, although I know to make sure to have all the ingredients at room temperature to make the stirring easier!  Took them to a family gathering and came home with none! A huge hit and I am planning to make them again for a birthday gathering.

I just made these and I'm happy with the recipe as a guide. I could not make as is because I don't have shortening or margarine since I like to use real ingredients so I just subbed unsalted butter as the fat. At first I chilled the dough for 45 minutes before baking just in case they flattened out like other reviewers noted, but they did not and in fact they were a little taller than I liked. So for the rest of the cookies I decided to let the batter come back to room temp and they came out great. They were a tad bit on the sandy/dry side but that could very well be due to the butter substitution or maybe I didn't cream the butter & sugar long enough? I would have liked more texture with the oats so next time I'll replace 1/2 cup of flour with more rolled oats. We all liked them though, these are perfect cookies to go with hot coffee or cold milk!

Used only butter.....no shortening in house.  Pressed the blobs with a fork in a typical cross-hatched pattern for the classic look.  These didn't last very long at all.  Every time we walked passed the cooling rack........one more cookie disappeared !!!!

So I was feeling creative with this recipe. I made half of the batch as cookies, and then I ran out of cookie sheets and had a small brownie pan so I took the dough and spread it into the 9x9 pan, put it in the oven for about 18 mins and then I had a brownie version of this cookie as well. I used the same dough for the brownie version as the cookies. Also, the only alteration I made to the recipe was I used a cup of butter instead of the margarine and shortening. Overall, both versions were really good, but the brownie version in i made was so much better, so I highly suggest that!

Nom nom nom!!!  This recipe combines pretty much all of life's greatest pleasures.  I did not take drastic liberties with the recipe the first go-round, as many people did.  I used 1 cup butter in place of margarine/shortening (that's all I had on hand), added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and added 1 small bag of mini chocolate chips (because, chocolate... duh).

The finished dough was a bit runny, I was tempted to add more oats, more peanut butter, more anything.  But, as the saying goes, more is not always better.  I was also tired so I took this as a sign to take a break.  I chilled the dough for 24 hrs, and once I was ready to finish this cookie party I used a cookie scoop for uniform balls of dough, and baked each batch at 350 for 12 minutes on Silpat mats.  They turned out incredibly gorgeous, and my cookie-monster boyfriend could not be more thrilled with this combination of all of his favorite flavors.

Great cookies! Easy to make, came out perfect. I used all butter and added walnut pieces, vanilla, and mini chocolate chips.

Peanut halves would be an awesome addition.

I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter and used maple brown sugar oatmeal instead of the plain. Then I dipped one end in dark chocolate and sprinkled with sliced almonds.  They were delicious.  I think next time I would use unsalted butter and more oatmeal though.

Outstanding cookies! I knew I'd have to modify this going into the recipe - had to use up a 16-ounce jar of lowfat, creamy Peter Pan (my stepdaughter was trying to be healthy) that got forgotten in the back of the cupboard. Made a double batch, used all butter, recommended vanilla, extra oats, and added a half bag of semi-sweet chips - didn't want to overpower the peanut butter. Measured by tablespoonfuls and baked for 11-12 minutes per sheet. Turned out beautiful - we like ours flatter and chewy. These were perfectly delicious! I will make these many more times. I'm looking forward to making my next batch with Skippy Natural Super Chunk peanut butter instead of a low-fat version.

I made these cookies for my husband for Fathers Day.  He was crazy about them.  They were soft and chewy and delicious. I made them much larger than the recipe required, my Husband loves large cookies. I had a few myself.

The cookies turned out really good. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, cut the white sugar in half also added 1/2 cup more of peanut butter. I did half the recipe without oats and other half with. Without the oats the cookies spread out but with oats they didn't. I would suggest that if you are making them with oats to press them down some. Otherwise, they tasted really good.

I made this with all butter instead of shortening/margarine and used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. It took 15 minutes on the bottom rack and came out great. If you have a sweet tooth, use all the sugar. My husband doesn't like sweets that much so I always use less sugar for him, and he likes these with less. I added white chocolate chips after I made half the cookies to add some sweetness for me.

These are great cookies! I took one suggestion and added more oatmeal, 3/4 cup to be exact.  I also replaced all the AP flour with white whole wheat flour. I did a taste test with my kids where I made a small batch with nothing added, semi-sweet chocolate chips, Reese's Mini Pieces, or peanut butter baking chips.  Both my kids thought all the cookies were equally good, and I agree!

These were sooooo good! I was hesitant when making the recipe because many reviewers made many modifications- but I decided to go with the recipe and I am so glad I did. The only things  I did differently was used unsalted butter instead of shortening and margarine and I added raisins.

These spread out the first time I made them and were too sweet. Also I just use a cup of butter, no shorting. So second time I made sure the batter (butter) was cold when I put them in the oven and used a half cup of each white and brown sugar. I also sometimes use crunchy peanut butter or chocolate chips. With these changes I make them a lot.

My family doesn't like regular peanut butter cookies and we didn't have chocolate chips, so I decided to give these a try. They turned out delicious and moist. Next time I will probably add some chocolate chips to the batter. For those saying their cookies turned out flat it's because your butter was too warm. When you make cookies butter should be softened just enough to be able to whip it up, not melted.  If it's coming from the fridge I microwave it for 15 seconds, turn it over and microwave for 10 more seconds. That seems to be just right. I use real unsalted butter so it might need adjusted for other types like margarine.

I made this recipe and changed it a bit...I added two sticks of butter rather than using shortening.  I added 1  3/4 cup of flour instead and 2 cups of oats. I suggest using more peanut butter... at least 1/2 a cup more or 1 cup more.  I also added Resse's peanut butter candies.  I thought it was a good cookie, but I couldn't give it 5 stars!

Yes used canola oil instead of shorting, and all brown sugar instead of  the suggested amount of white sugar. Added chocolate chips and OMG!  will definitely use again , maybe add some nuts next time.

Why does it say to use an ungreased cookie sheet? I didn't grease it,  and they burned on the bottom.  My own mistake,  but I would never used an ungreased cookie sheet again.

GREAT! Doesn't need modification but for health I cut fat in half and used coconut oil, then took out 1/4 cup from both sugars, and used old fashioned rather than quick cooking oats. Perfectly soft and chewy, they tasted and looked like cookies from a bakery!

Wow! The only changes I made was using all butter instead of margerine & shortening. I had some left over raisins & mixed them in. I've been baking for over 30 years & have to say this the best cookie recipe I've ever used. My husband loves them. Without a doubt, this is definitely a KEEPER recipe. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!

The only change I made was I used 1 cup unsalted butter instead of shortening/margarine.  I used 2 different cookie sheets & found the thinner $1 store cookie sheet kept the cookies from getting flat. Great taste, soft on the inside with a crispy edge.

I'm not a fan of peanut butter cookies but these were really good! I had a jar of natural (the kind you have to stir up) chunky PB that nobody would eat. So we made cookies with it. followed the recipe with one exception, all butter as I didn't have shortening on hand. Very Good!

I have a peanut-allergic child, so I made these cookies with Wow Butter, and they were excellent.  I did also make the recommended adjustments: extra oats, a little less sugar, and unsalted butter rather than shortening.

These make excellent lunch box snacks, and freeze very, very well.

These were OK. I hoped for a more chewy texture, and they had a lot of salt! Not than I am used to tasting in a cookie. Overall, they were "alright." Not good, not bad.

I didn't make any changes  to the recipe itself. What I did do differently was to bake them for ten minutes and then leave them on the cookie sheet for two minutes. Then I removed them to a wire rack. Great recipe!  My husband agrees!

These were delicious!  I made around 6 dozen (doubled recipe)and took 4 to work.  They disappeared very quickly and had a lot of people asking for the recipe.  They are nice and chewy and addictive.  I one batch with chocolate chips and they were even better!

They are really much better than girl scout cookies. I do recommend one more Tablespoon of butter and 3T of cream. For the center.  We did make a chocolate cookie with this center  and it was like a Reese cookie. Omg??????

These will be my families new favorite peanut butter cookie. Loved every bite.  Split the batch one with chocolate chips and none on the other.

Just a few minor changes to the recipe - like everyone who loves butter replaced the shortening & margarine used salted butter- only used half the salt  - baked it for only 12 minutes and turning it halfway then let it cook down on the baking sheet this will make them chewy in the middle , just the way I love my cookies - also added semi sweet chocolate chips.

Again great recipe thank you.

They turned out great!  I used 1 cup salted butter and also used a hefty squirt of chocolate syrup.  Because of that I added a touch more oats.   I made mine gluten free with oats and measure for measure flour.    Yum. Tasty!!!!

I think that other than the peanut butter flavor these are very good cookies. I want more peanut butter flavor. I will make again and use more peanut butter. May need to add some more oatmeal as well to tie it up. I also made these have regular and half with chocolate chips. The other half will be happy cause he is a chocolate chi cookie fan.

Wonderful!  I used chunky peanut butter and unsalted butter instead of margarine.  They did need a full 15 minutes in the oven.

Amazing!! I did modify the recipe a bit. I only used butter and brown sugar. I added a teaspoon or so of vanilla. I used duck eggs, they really make baked goods richer. I also did 1 1/4 cup flour and a half cup cocoa powder. I used 1 1/2 cups oats and added 3/4 cup each peanut butter and chocolate chips. They turned out chewy and just delicious!

This receipe is awesome, I did make some changes. I used 1 cup ( two ) sticks melted butter (salted) instead of the shortning and margarine. I did not add the salt called for. I used 2 cups flour instead of 1 and1/2. I used extra crunchy peanut butter instead. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup choped walnuts. everything else I used what the receipt called for. bake for 11-12 min at 350. They turned out great. Perfect taste. I will make these again, again, again, again, again, again. You get the picture. Try it, it will be worth your time.

Made with whole wheat flour and followed other recommendations to increase the flour by another 1/4 cup, used 1 1/2 cup oats and decreased white sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp vanilla & chocolate chips. Chilled dough as I cooked the batches. Turned out great.

This is likely my fault but they were salty as heck! I didn't add salt (I never do with my baking) but for some reason mine turned out super salty, I did use 1 cup butter as I don't have margarine (it's awful for your health) or shortening. like I say, likely my fault lol.

This recipe elevates the average peanut butter cookie, the oatmeal is awesome!  Much like most other reviews, I cut the sugar and would cut it even more next time too.

EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe exactly. I rolled the dough into balls, rolled in sugar and lightly flattened before baking for 14 minutes. Made 34 good-sized cookies. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Pretty good, but with a few little tweaks, these could be 5 star cookies.
Too much baking soda. Instead of 2 teaspoons, try a single teaspoon or 1 & ½ teaspoons.

Not enough peanut butter. Instead of 1 cup of peanut butter, try  1 & ½ cups or possibly 2 cups.

I heated my oven for 350°F for the first batch. My cookie pans are older so they burned on the underside and were under cooked on the top side.

Changing my oven to 225°F resolved this issue and left me with peanut butter cookies that were light brown on the bottom and soft.

These are so good. Sometimes I use crunchy peanut butter, and it works well. I like mine a little chewy in the center, so I put them in for 10 minutes and let them cool on the sheet before I move them to a plate or a rack.

Took these on my Thanksgiving Day trek to four different houses and they were a hit at every stop! The texture of the cookie was almost perfect for my taste: not too dry, not too chewy. I did make a few modifications: 

1/2 cup unsalted butter in lieu of  shortening
1/2  cup butter in lieu of margarine
+1 teaspoon vanilla
+1 cup chocolate chips

I use 1 cup butter.  I also tossed in some chocolate chips; because who doesn't like oatmeal, peanutbutter, chocolate chip cookies  They are FANTASTIC!  Soft, chewy cookie.  You could even under bake just a tad, it helps keep them chewy.

Delicious Cookies!  I made it dairy free by substituting Butter Flavored Crisco for the margarine & shortening.  I also subbed 1/3 whole wheat and added 1 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  I added extra oats.  Kids & adults loved them.

I used all butter and old fashioned oats because that is what I had.  With about 11 min. baking time, they turned out flat but delightfully chewy once cool and I think refrigerating the dough and pan is a must.  Even my mother who usually doesn't like oatmeal anything likes it!

This is a good cookie recipe.  I added 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans.  I think the recipe would work with extra oats as others have tried.  I used 2 sticks of butter.

5 stars for simplicity, 4 because I think it tastes better with butter.  Followed a few suggestions - a bit more pbutter, oatmeal and flour, a bit less sugar.  But it would have been fine with the full amount of sugar!

Yum. I like them best baked at the full 15 minutes. Stayed with the recipe except for using all butter.  I'll probably try variations but they aren't necessary for an excellent cookie! Thank you!

Subbed oat flour and used butter instead of margarine and these are probably the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted. Awesome crunchy outside and chew centre.

Perfect, sturdy cookie.  I use butter and oil instead of margarine.

For variety, I add 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips.

This is a decent enough base cookie recipe. I knew right away that I had to make several changes before attempting it (like the shockingly high amount of salt & soda!). I used half butter and half butter flavored crisco, I used all white sugar (nothing against brown sugar, I was just out), I only used HALF the salt and baking soda called for, I DOUBLED the oats and used old fashioned instead of quick oats, I added a teaspoon vanilla, (wish I'd used more) 1/4 a tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 a tsp cinnamon, a heaping handful of walnuts (chunky peanut butter would have solved this lack of nuts problem but I only had smooth), a few white chocolate chunks, and about 1/2 a cup of crasins. NOW it is a very good hybrid peanut butter/oatmeal cookie. As the recipe is by default, it's just a peanut butter cookie with some oats in it. It's still OK, not amazing. It's greasy feeling on the tongue, and at the same time it still doesn't have enough butter flavor. The cookies bake up amazing, very good texture, turn crisp on the outside but stay chewy inside after cooking. They are very fragile on the baking pan (that sandy peanut butter cookie texture still comes through nicely), and I think it's a good idea to under bake them a touch so they can cool ON THE BAKING PAN, since they are difficult to move off it until cooled a bit. A great packing/giving cookie once it cools.

I used old fashion oatmeal, as that is what I had.  These are wonderful. I put raisins in half the dough. Next time, I will add a small amount of additional oatmeal.

Will absolutely make again-and soon! I added 1/2 cup more of peanut butter, 1/4 cup more of ap flour, about a tsp. of pure vanilla extract, and used 1/2 Splenda Brown sugar substitute and half light brown sugar. I actually messed up and made a novice mistake and forgot to cream the peanut butter with the butter and sugar, and didn't realize it until I had almost finished folding in the flour mixture, so I beat the peanut butter in a separate bowl and then added it after the flour - and to my shock (and with much gratitude) the cookies still turned out delicious!!! The next time (after making sure everything is added in the correct order, lol) I will keep the flour measurement as the recipe stated. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I made this today, but I used coconut oil instead of shortening; upped the flour a bit and added vanilla.  Used real butter and upped the oatmeal about 1/2 c more.

I used more butter instead of shortening, and I also used chunky peanut butter. After I took them out of the oven I broke up a Hershey's dark chocolate bar and put a piece in the center of each cookie. They were delicious!

Will totally make these again. Yum!
I added 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Very tasty! My kiddo, that doesn't care for classic peanut butter cookies, enjoyed these. Will also try them in a GF variety.

love the texture. I cover the dough and let sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour then roll in balls and flatten just a bit before baking.  I always make sure my baking pan is cooled off before placing more dough on it  so I get no flatting of the cookies.  Like another person mentioned, you can always add a little more flour too. Thanks .

My two boys and I made these cookies together one afternoon when we couldn't decide between peanut butter and oatmeal cookies. These are awesome! We didn't have any shortening so we just substituted with more unsalted butter. The flavor is completely peanut butter. We didn't taste the oats at all. No worries though. We love peanut butter and they are wonderful!

Great cookies - I made them using gluten free flour and dairy free Earth Balance butter and shortening. 

This recipe definitely calls for way too much sugar though- next time I would reduce it by quite a bit. I also added an extra 1/4 C of oats and it could have used even more

changed the recipe to all butter with extra oats (1/2 cup or so) and less sugar (1/2 cup instead of 3/4).  Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and baked for 12 minutes.  Turned out great!

Turned out pretty good but the dough was extremely greasy, not sure if that was because I used extra peanut butter or if it was from the shortening or because I used butter or a combo of the 3.  I added vanilla and chocolate chips as well.  I will stick to the other recipe on here I use for pb, chocolate oatmeal cookies in the future.

This recipe is almost perfect. Just like other suggestions, I omitted the shortening and used one cup of butter instead. I added an extra half cup of oats and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also used chunky peanut butter and omitted the salt as well. It was prefect. So yummy! I added chocolate chips to half of the batch. I highly recommend this recipe. Love it!

I don't rate many recipes but I use a lot from this sight.  I hate when someone rates a recipe and then tells you all the changes they made.  I'm not one of those,  I made this recipe exactly as posted and they are amazing.  My husband loves them and he isn't a big Peanut Butter lover.  Thank you for this great recipe.

When I saw the amount of fat ( 2 cups!!!) and only 1 1/2 cups of flour, I figured I was in for problems, so I test baked one cookie. Sure enough, it spead out. I added 1/2 cup more oats, test baked another, and it still spread, so I added another 1/2 cup, doubling the original amount, and the cookie baked off well.

Best peanut butter cookies ever.  I didn't have any shortening or marg so I used butter but next time will follow the recipe.  The cookies seemed even better the next day and had the family raving about them, my grandson was telling his friend that "Gramma makes the best cookies"!

Perfect and chewy except I only put 1/2 a teaspoon of salt now. A teaspoon is way too much salt. Delicious otherwise, though! Mmmmmmm!

I would reduce the salt a little is I were to make them again but many people might like that salty edge. I did make some changes: used Coconut Oil in place of shortening, and I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour instead of regular flour. They taste terrific and if you like the salty edge, you'll likely give them a 5 star rating compared to my 4 star rating.

They're easy to make, and it's the first time I've ever baked cookies that did not come out of a Pillsbury container, so If I could make them and they tasted great then anybody can!

Baking time of 10 minutes was all it took in our gas oven.

Thought these cookies were very good.  I added half marg & half butter, a little less sugar & more oatmeal as per previous comments.  They are sweet so less sugar would work even better.  Also more oatmeal to keep them together nicer as they spread.  But make sure to take them out and let them sit for about 5 minutes before taking out of the pan.  Will make again.

I used butter and added vanilla and extra oats.  Next time I might double the oats.  
When they first come from oven they are really light color and puffy but flatten out on pan if you make sure to let them rest a few minutes.

Edit: I doubled the oats and added some oat "flour" (guessing about 1/3c)

Good cookies. I didn't have shortening on hand so I used all butter. Next time, I will use shortening and will refrigerate the dough for about twenty minutes in an attempt to keep them from flattening out while cooking.

I just made these cookies and they came out great!  I took the time to read positive reviews and suggestions, so I used the last drop of my almond extract and I thought that I had quick-cooking oats, but I had the old fashioned oats, and they made my cookies a little chewy, but they tasted fantastic.  The reason that I didn't give five stars, is because I took suggestions from other reviews to decrease the amount of baking soda (to 1 tsp), increase the sugar (to 1 cup), peanut butter  (to 2 cups) and oats ( to 2 cups) from people who did these things.  However, I still encourage use of this recipe!

The recipe is very easy to follow and uses readily available ingredients. For a different taste I used butter instead of shortening and margarine. I also add a cup(or so) of baking chips. Peanut butter chips or chocolate chips work best.

Yum! I would add more oats as one user suggested and make sure to take these out of the oven as soon as the edges barely start looking golden- they are not good when overdone. I used all butter instead of butter and shortening and they still tasted great.  Cheers!

These were wonderful. I used all butter-flavored Crisco.  I made these for a preschool snack for my son to take to school. there is a dairy allergy at his school so these were perfect. They are completely dairy free. I used Peter Pan honey-roasted peanut butter. The teachers reported that all the children loved them which is a rarity. They do get overcooked easily so watch them carefully.

This is now my favorite cookie.  I subbed organic coconut oil for shortening, and old fashioned oats in place of quick cooking oats.  I refrigerated dough before baking.  Phenomenal cookies!  Thin, and crisp. Perfect combo of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies.  I also baked them on parchment paper resulting in the most beautifully consistent color ftom top to bottom.

I followed another reviewer and used butter instead of margarine & shortening because of personal preference otherwise I followed the recipe. If I were to make them again I would add more oats (1/2 cup or even 1 cup) and probably another egg. It didn't seem to stick together well so I had to smoosh the dough before placing it on the cookie sheet. The oats were a yummy addition but definitely sparse. Overall, yummy recipe, NOT THE BEST EVER, but good! I definitely will be adding oats to my PB cookies from now on though :) Oh, I added chocolate chips to half of the dough and it was preferred by the family. ;)

Per other suggestions I added 1 tsp of vanilla & cut the salt in half. I only used butter instead of margarine & shortening & cooked for 12 min. The cookie looks great but is pretty bland and not very sweet. I won't make this one again.

These cookies were delicious.  Like others I used all butter instead of margarine and shortening.    These were a wonderful combination of soft and crispy at the edges and chewy yest tender.  Terrific as otherwise written, but I think for my family's personal taste we will be adding another 1/3 Cup of Oats next time to give it even more texture.

Great recipe! I used unsalted butter, because I try to avoid margarines and shortening, but followed the rest to a T. 
I chilled the dough before baking because I didn't want a flat cookie and they came out perfect! Thank you!

I substituted the margarine and shortening for butter, and used one and a half cups of brown sugar instead of using white, as well as whole wheat flower instead of white. Turned out quite delicious! Baked until just slightly turning brown, probably easy to overcook given the already brownish coloring of dough, so watch carefully.

Oh man, I was expecting them to be good but I was surprised HOW good. Will have to double or triple batch next time, these won't last the day. I cut way back on the sugar and used butter and shortening, still awesome! Watch them like a hawk to be sure they don't burn.

It's a hit!  I followed the recipe pretty precisely with just a few changes:  
° I increased the oatmeal by 1/2 cup,
° I added  approx. 1 tsp. vanilla.

After baking these for 10 min., they were baked  through and just the way my husband likes them -  soft.

I think that one of the next times I make these I'll add chocolate chips.

This is now my go-to cookie recipe! Easy & delicious, it's become my family's favorite. The recipe is great as is, or add a bag of chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts with the oatmeal. Today we added butterscotch chips and they are FANTASTIC. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used cocnut oil instead of shortening, a little less white sugar and whole wheat flour. I'll make these again and again.

I did use strictly butter, no shortening. Just personal preference.  Very soft and chewy cookie. Fabulous flavor and texture! So tasty and good. Oatmeal doesn't really stand out, but adds an extra "texture" to the cookie. Highly recommend this recipe!

25 March 2016 -- delicious!  Made with peanut butter and Nutella (ran out of PB), milk chocolate & peanut butter chips.  Like other reviews suggested, used over 2c whole oats and 1/2c whole wheat flour+ 1c all purpose flour.   The finish on the cookies was lovely, a nice crisp exterior with with cracks and a softer chewy middle.

I read several reviews that suggested adding another cup of oats.  I shouldn't have.  It was crumbly and dry even though I added a half cup more peanut butter.  I'll stick to the recipe next time.  The good things we noticed were that our cookie scooper/dropper was all that was needed.  They are thicker and could be softer, not crunchy style cookies if following the recipe.  I'll update this again after trying it the way I should have, by the recipe the first time!  We also added a teaspoon of vanilla and one of almond extract.  That was a good touch.

Delicious cookies! I used 1 1/2 c. Skippy's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Spread in place of regular peanut butter. Also, per other reviewers suggestions, I used butter instead of margarine, 1/4 c. more flour, a little less salt, 2 c. oats & added 1 t. vanilla. The dough was soft  & sticky (refrigerating it might be a good idea), and tasted like those chocolate/peanut butter/oat no-bake cookies. It baked up into wonderful cookies.

Loved the cookie recipe.  I did use coconut oil instead of the shortening, as I've just started using the oil in recipes to try, turned out great. Also added 1/2 cup choc. chips.

I halved the recipe and got 15 cookies. As the reviews suggested, I used 1 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup shortening. One personal change I made was to combine the oats with the flour mixture instead of adding them separately, and the dough came out very even that way. 

After 10 minutes, the cookies didn't look quite done, but I took them out anyways and after they cooled they hardened very nicely. I'd recommend not cooking them too long, as many of the negative reviews say they were too dry and that extra 5 minutes of cook time could be the culprit.  
  
The cookies flattened decently, but not very well. Because of the oats, they remained fairly rounded.

Delicious!  However I did make some changes  based on other reviewers advice. I added half cup oats (slow cooked) and two tsp vanilla, cut sugar by 1/2 cup and used all butter no shortening. Refrigerated after I made dough for two hours so slow cooked oats would soften and cookies wouldn't run too much. Thanks for awesome recipe!

Made them twice. Doubled the oats the first time but they turned out dry as a result, not to big a problem and i used 1/2 cup more the second time. I also used 1/2 chunky and 1/2 creamy peanut butter with 1 teaspoon vanilla and butter instead of margarine. I also reduced the sugars by 1/4 cup each.

The dough gave me food poisoning but that's my fault for eating it uncooked.

These were great.  I have a great oatmeal cookie recipe, but they need to be eaten quickly, ( which isn’t an issue), but these stayed soft and chewy for days. Great to be able to store for several days, and makes a lot.  I will make them again.  Everyone enjoyed them.

The best cookie I've had in a very long time.  Thanks for sharing this heavenly treat. June 2016 Update: I have made these three times since my first review. Best cookie on this site. Another update, December 2016:  Definitely chill your batter for half an hour before baking. For those who have made comments, perfection but I added.....ummmmm...NO. Perfection is what this cookie IS. Leave well enough alone.

So good! The only thing I added was chocolate chips.  My husband said it was better than subway cookies, which we both love! Thanks for the recipe! Very yummy :)

We really enjoyed these as just a simple cookie when following the recipe exactly. Having made them multiple times, my kids prefer them with mini chocolate chips and/or peanut butter chips, and I usually substitute butter for the shortening and double the oats and peanut butter. If your cookies seem too sweet or too salty, take a look at your peanut butter because I've noticed a big difference in the brand of peanut butter. When I use an all-natural, unsalted, unsweetened peanut butter then I do not reduce the sugar or salt in the recipe.  This is our go-to peanut butter cookie recipe.

I added 1 cup of raisens, 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter, 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, & 1/2 cup "unsalted" butter. I chilled my dough in the refrigerator for about an hour. I think it makes the dough easier to work with & helps prevent "flat"cookies. 

Other then these few modifications, I kept everything else the same. Came out crunchy yet soft & I almost want to say a little flaky, but not so much that they are falling apart. 

I scooped out 1 tablespoons & pressed/rolled them into balls. Leave at least 2" apart so the cookies don't become *one* entwined cookie..otherwise your going to have square misshapen cookies..and won't cook right.

I cooked mine for 15 minutes. Soon as they brown around the edges take them out & let them cool before moving to wire rack. 

These cookies are very simple to make & are delicious. I will most definitely, bake these again in the near future. Yum!

These are a great cookie, we are fans of peanut butter and loved them!! I did use whole wheat flour in place white (@3/4 cup = 1 cup, +, watch consistency) and we loved it, added to my favorites!!!

Changes for more peanut butter flavor! 

Adjusted to 64 servings, increased  by 1/3.
1 16 oz jar smuckers natural creamy peanut butter.
2/3 c. Salted Butter
No shortening or margerine

1 .5 c Ghirardelli dark choc. Chips
3/4 tsp. Salt

Dough will feel greasy/oily
Cook 14 min. 

Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly but added raisins  to half of the batch, turned out great. Could probably cut out shorting  and add a little more margarine, but still a good cookie recipe.

Heaven in cookie form!  I followed the tips of some other reviewers and used all real butter (no shortening or margarine), added a bit more oats, and used a bit of vanilla as well.  My family (and Santa!) raved about these cookies, I will be making again for sure!

I need an intervention to stop  eating these cookies, my saving grace is that they will eventually run out! I used all butter instead of shortening and margarine and I added white chocolate chips. These cookies are phenomenal, perfect pair to cup of black coffee.

Used 1 c butter in place of shortening and margarine.  Used the Pampered Chef small scoop to make 80  cookies 2.5-inches in diameter (on average).  The consistency of the batter was great -- not too sticky, but not too dry.  One of the best PB cookies I've had.  Love it!

I needed to make something to bring to a Christmas party and did not have time to run to the store, so I was looking for a recipe that had "pantry" ingredients, and my pantry isn't overly well stocked so I knew this was a tall order! I Found this recipe and had almost everything, so decided to give it a try. I substituted canola oil for the shortening, and did add extra oats based on other reviews, used reduced fat creamy peanut butter. I was concerned as I was putting the dough on the cookie sheets, but they turned out wonderfully! I did heed the advice of another reviewer and put the dough in the fridge to let it firm up and that helped enormously. Very, very tasty and chewy, which my family loved - since I did bring the leftover cookies home! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

First time making these great cookies.  I didn't substitute anything, but used margarine and coconut oil for the shortening.  Made half the cookies plain with no add ons..but the second batch with butterscotch chips and dried cranberries.  Wonderfully easy and good cookie.

Made a half batch, substituting the equivalent amount of butter for both the shortening & margarine (didn't have either of them).  They were crispy, delicious. & light...kids & I really enjoyed these...you will too!!! 12/20/16 I made these recently and added roughly 3/4 cup Reese's peanut butter chips...made them even more amazing!

very nice, I decided to use only butter instead of half shortening half butter and added a little more white sugar so they could flatten out more and be a bit more sweeter.

I cut the recipe in half, used vegan butter, no shortening,  used about 3/4 brown sugar 1/8 white sugar  but otherwise followed the recipe for the first 12 cookies. Then I added dried cherries and pecans (1/8 cup for both) for the other batch. I would have used Old fashion oats verses quick oats next time. There is like no oats in the cookies! And maybe added vanilla extract. NOTE: read reviews before attempting the cookie! They help! :)

The PERFECT peanut butter cookies!  just chewy enough, with just enough crispness. I only had margarine so that's what I used, otherwise i  followed the recipe exactly. I will never even bother trying any other pb cookie recipe again!

My husband loves Peanut Butter everything so I decided to make these for him. They turned out so delish & soft. However I didn't add shortening I used Butter (unsalted) instead. He wasn't dissapointed at all.

Very good. I added a bit more flour and oatmeal at the suggestion of others. Used only butter...no margarine in our house. I made 2 pans with room temp dough and will chill the rest to see if that makes any difference. We like them a lot. Now will try the grandchild test:-)  I also added vanilla. What are cookies without vanilla?

These were good but, in my opinion, not great. I like traditional peanut butter cookies better. However, I'll also note that if you use quick cook 1 minute oats, these would be a great way to sneak fiber into a reluctant someone. The oats completely disappeared, and even though I made them myself, I couldn't tell they were there.

I have been making these cookies for several years; they are absolutely perfect,  I do add an extra 1/2 cup extra crunchy peanut butter and a handful more oats but everything else is exact.  People think they are from a bakery they are so good.  And they always look gorgeous.!!

I did make a change as people suggested and added more oatmeal and vanilla extract. I also rolled the cookies into four logs and refrigerated them until I was ready to bake. I then had slice and bake cookies and they turned out nice and round and even. I thought they were delicious. I also used unsalted butter and shortening and had no problem with the dough. It took at least 15 mins to bake.

These were very tasty but by the texture of the dough it seemed to need more solids so I added 1/2 cup of oatmeal and another 1/2 cup of flour. I'm glad I did because the cookies had too much fat and would have run together. Next time I will reduce the butter to 3/4 cup. (I used all butter for my shortening because I trust cows to make good food not labs.) I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Next time I'll also reduce the sugar a little. Thanks for recipe.

Great flavour, but I really needed to adjust the ingredients!  I made the first tray exactly as the recipe goes. They turned out to be flat, amoeba like blobs. For the rest of the batter, I increased the oatmeal by 3/4 cup and they turned out great!  I also followed the suggestion of adding vanilla and I would definitely include it every time from now on. One of my husband's faves now.

I really liked the cookies.  They tasted delicious.  I altered the recipe a little.  I used 1 cup butter in stead of the shortening,  I added 1 tsp of vanilla, a little extra oats and they came out tasty with a good texture.  The required sugar was perfect and almost taste healthy for you.

These cookies are so yummy! They taste delicious and I love the crunch of them! The one thing I don't like is that they burn very easily. I recommend to cook them for 10 or eleven minutes. I tried three batches and the first ones I put in for fifteen minutes and they were rock hard. Just twelve minutes even left them a little dark but ten was perfect!

As far as peanut butter cookies go, these were just ok. I omitted the shortening and used all butter. The texture was crumbly  and dry. I like crispier, chewy cookies. Maybe a little less flour would help.

Very good cookies! Crisp on the outside and soft inside. Great flavor. The dough seems really thin for a cookie, but they bake up great. Be sure to let them cool a bit and firm up before removing from the sheet. 13 minutes was perfect on an air bake sheet.

This oatmeal peanut butter cookie recipe is exceptional!! Since I  did not have shortening on hand , I used all butter and refrigerated the dough for an hour.   I dropped the dough on cookie sheets using a small scoop which produces uniform sized cookies and yielded almost 4 dozen.    I baked the cookies until they looked crinkled on top and slightly browned(approx. 11 mins) then let them set up on the cookie sheet to cool before transferring to a wire rack.    I will be making these cookies again and will also add more oatmeal, add vanilla, and decrease the sugar slightly as suggested by many reviewers.

As others did, I used unsalted butter in place of margarine/shortening.  I added a dash of vanilla and decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  I used all natural crunchy PB.  I rotated the baking sheet after 5 minutes, and found that 9 minutes was perfect in my oven.  My 2 year old has declared these to be the "Best cookies ever!"

I have to give these 5 stars even though I altered the recipe, because they are that good!  Use real butter instead of shortening & margarine, & reduce the amount to 3/4 cup. Reduce salt to 1/2 tsp. Use rolled oats instead of quick-cooking & increase the amount to 1 1/2 cups. These are fantastic!

I did modify it some. I didn't have shortening so i used 2cups of margine. Also it wasn't  as solid as i wanted so i used another cup of oats and 1/2 cup of flour more. Other than that, they came out great.

Deceptively simple and delicious! For a little extra zing, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and about 1 tsp honey.

This was the best cookie I have ever made.  I did make a few changes:  butter instead of margarine, a little vanilla and a handful of semisweet chocolate chips.  My family went CRAZY over them!

My family loved them!!! I prefer them more as bite sized, though, because they are quicker and easier to eat. Also, the bigger sized ones crumble more. But other than that, I substitute vegetable oil for shortening and butter for margarine (same measurements) and my family devours them.

I didn't have sugar, so I added a few drops of peppermint extract. When they came out of the oven, the peppermint flavor was overwhelmed the oats and the peanut butter. And they were bland. Will not make again.

I laid down on the couch while I was waiting for my second batch to bake, and when I got up to check on it, there were 3 gone from the last tray (: My sister loves these and so do I.
I used butter instead of shortening/margarine solely because that's my preference. Little extra oats and a dash of vanilla extract, and it came out perfectly!

We love this recipe!  My 2 favorite ingredients, peanut butter and oatmeal. I doubled the recipe because I like to share and everyone loved them. Only thing I changed is I replaced the shortening and margarine for butter, reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added an additional 1/2 cup of oatmeal for a chewier texture. 1st time but not the last.

I have made this recipe a couple of times, but instead of using regular shortening, I use Coconut oil. Today I'm making them and instead of oatmeal I used the same measurement of bran. I like the original recipe, but I also like experimenting. Thanks for a good and easy to make recipe!

These were great. I cut the sugar by 1/2C, added 1tbsp vanilla, and 1/2C old fashioned oats because that is what I like. Dough was very thick; I would not attempt with a hand mixer. Thank goodness for my kitchen aid. I dropped them by overflowing teaspoon on cookie sheet and baked for 10min. Turned out perfect, not runny at all. Slightly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The oatmeal was not particularly noticeable in the end product, which could be fixed by altering the flour-oatmeal ratio.

I usually don't like to see reviews that don't follow the recipe as it was written but since there are so many cookie recipes out there, had to put my 2¢ in. I just used butter, whole wheat flour, coconut & pecans. Also a little more oats. Patted them in a pan ( to lazy to scoop them out). Turned out beautiful & so good!! Trying hard not to eat them all.

My family is giving this recipe 5 stars.  The only changes I made was to use butter instead of margarine and crunchy peanut butter because that was what was in my pantry supplies.  I also added  1 1/2 tsp vanilla .   Very easy and yummy.

I like this recipe except I did some change up and used only butter and 3 cups of oatmeal and mini chocolate chips and yummmmy I will make them again, not the type that likes peanut butter to dominate the flavor of the cookie!

Borderline "okay" in my opinion. Followed the recipe very closely except used butter flavored shortening and added white chocolate chips. Cookies were crumbly, and dry. Flavor is not terrible just didn't like the texture at all. First batch I cooked 14 minutes, because they didn't "look" done, second batch I cooked 12 minutes and these were slightly better.

I would double the amount of oatmeal for extra crispiness and half the salt as peanut butter is salty enough by itself. Also I used unsalted butter with no shortening. Turned out great. Next time could possibly add raisins or chocolate chips.

I just pulled the last batch from the oven and I'm in trouble!  I added butterscotch chips to all and chocolate chips in addition to some as well as extra oats and sub butter for margarine. They are so good! And I don't even bake so the fact I pulled these off is a testament to the recipe. Thanks!

Good recipe.  I used half butter and half marge ( as I needed to get it out of the refer) added some coconut, raisins, a handful of rolled oats in addition to the quick cook oats.  Nice and chewy, and the cookie dough was excellent!  C'mon doesn't everyone taste their batter?

This is the only recipe I follow now when they ask for oatmeal peanut butter cookies. Sometimes I add more shortening to make them crunchy as some family members would prefer.It's also the first baking recipe I taught my 8 year old daughter.

I wasn't a huge fan of these cookies. They had a decent flavor but I felt they were really dry and crumbly. I personally prefer a chewy cookie.

I  made these for my daughter (per her request) and she Loved them!   I read a few reviews and made a few changes ( which is why I can't it give it 5 stars).  I only used 1/2 tsp. salt, used all butter instead of margarine and shortening, I also added chocolate chips and raisins.   I'm sure I'll be baking these again!

Loved it! Just two changes: I added 50% more oatmeal (old fashioned)because I love oatmeal. Then, I rolled them into large balls and flattened partially with a cup. The ended up big and thick and a little chewy. Perfect!

Yummy!!! A definite keeper in my recipe box!  I didn't have shortening so I used coconut oil with the butter (it gave them a nice subtle coconut flavor) .... And I only had about a 1/2 cup of pb left so I used what I had .... And I added some dark choc chips for fun!!  :)

I had high hopes for this recipe. I did substitute butter for margarine (margarine tastes like mayonnaise to me), added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp (I was using a homemade peanut butter that was made with salted peanuts). These cookies are really, as one reviewer said, more of a sugar cookie than a peanut butter cookie- the sugar is more prominent than anything else. After sitting and cooling, the initial greasiness goes away, and you do get a chewy cookie. I think, with less sugar and maybe a little more flour, you could have a stellar cookie. These are certainly edible, but I'm going to keep searching for the perfect chewy peanut butter cookie.

I use all butter (salted sweet cream butter) instead of shortening and margarine. I add extra pb and oats. I make sure dough is cooler to keep cookies from flattening during baking. Absolutely delicious!!

I baked exactly as is except added 1tsp of vanilla for extra flavour. Overall they were a very flavourful and tastes cookie!! Chilled my dough in the freezer for a few minutes before the first batch and between batches and also cooled the cookie sheets between batches and my cookies turned out quite flat. Next time I will try adding extra flour. I will also reduce the

The cookies melted like Frosty the Snowman in 100 degree weather.  I froze the dough and tried again.  They still melted.  I couldn't do the crisscross on the raw cookie dough.  

Use 1/2 cup less butter, 3/4 cup less sugar, etc.

I was thinking what a good combination of oat and peanut butter and gave it a try. It is very peanut buttery and soft and the oats...it seemed very familiar ...and then OMGoodness!! It tastes just like the old Girl Scout Peanut Butter Cookies except these are soft!! It might even be interesting to try a peanut butter icing drizzle on them, but these are perfect just the way they came out and I followed the recipe exact. Very Goood! A keeper!!!

These are delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  Was a little unsure of the texture of the oats at first but it's important to resist the urge to eat these right away.  Wait until they're completely cool and they are just perfect. Baked for 11 minutes on insulated cookie sheets in a gas-powered convection oven. I now have no need for any other peanut butter cookie recipe!

Everyone loves these cookies. Feel free to skimp on the sugar and margarine a smidgeon, and BE SURE to not overcook!

Yum yum and yum! These were a hit! They are not too sweet not too peanut buttery and not to oatmealy everything thing about them is perfect down to how chewy they stay. We did add in a cup of mini candy  coated pieces just for fun. My batch made 6 dozen with my smallest scoop and they went super fast.

Made these using only butter and added chopped salted peanuts. They are amazing! When they started getting softer, the second day because of the heat, I put them in the fridge and they tasted just as great cold

These were great. However, I did use butter instead and I only used 1/2 cup. I only used a 1/2 cup of white sugar as well. When I made these, I used crunchy peanut and put a gingerbread glaze on them...seriously superb!

My husband and I have never liked peanut butter cookies. So when we say this recipe is a HIT, believe us! Wonderful texture, quick and easy, not over sweet, thanks to the shortening. LOVE!

This was a very tasty recipe. I used all margarine instead of shortening for half and I left out the salt because I was afraid it would be too salty. It turned out very light and I didn't have any problem with them running.

Great! These are soft, chewy, and delicious cookies. I used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup margarine and used fresh ground oats rather than quick oats. Wonderful recipe.

Fantastic recipe.  I add Omega 3 Trail mix (cranberries, blueberries, walnuts, pepitas), flaxseed, chia seeds and chocolate chips.  While I wouldn't consider it health food - there are multiple healthy ingredients.  I don't mind my kids eating these.  I too add a bit more oats.  Very yummy cookie.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's my go-to cookie.

thought these were really good cookies.  Must admit I did not use the exact recipe as I substituted coconut oil for the shortening but they were still great.  Also threw Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips in for added taste.

I wanted to try an Oatmeal Peanut Butter cookie and this one did not disappoint. They are easy to make and delicious!!! They come out of the oven nice and golden brown and they are soft when you bite into them. I will make them again for sure.

Made this recipe twice and everyone has loved the cookies.  Following one reviewers suggestion, I substituted 1/2 cup butter for the margarine.  I had no problems with cookies breaking up.  Made about 5 dozen cookies.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

These are awesome cookies and so easy to make! They are already a family favorite. I did not have margarine so I substituted butter. I did add 3/4 cup more of oats because the dough needed to be firmer. They turned out great.

I found these to be a little sweet for me, perhaps more oatmeal.  I also added some vanilla, which was nice.  I would certainly make these again though.

This recipe is awesome!  I  successfully substituted Coconut oil for all butter and shortening. I replaced the sugar with coconut sugar and  used fresh ground peanut butter. I have also used the XO baking company gluten free flour mix with pretty good results. For anyone that wants a little extra nutrition, I suggest replacing a little of the flour with some flax. Chia seed is also a great addition! 
To the people who are complaining about hard cookies: Turn your oven down a bit and don't cook as long. Take the cookies out of the oven when they are slightly undercooked.  Leave them on the pan for 5-10 min. so the heat of the pan finish the cooking process.

I have made these cookies 3 times now for my husband.  He absolutely loves them.  Instead of using the margarine and shortening I used all coconut oil.  The texture of the cookies is wonderful and the coconut oil flavor is really great with the peanut butter and oats. I also cut down on the brown sugar by about 1/4 cup and the cookies were still sweet enough.

I didn't have shortening so I used coconut oil. These were excellent. I also added a little extra flour about a 1/4 cup. The dough seemed a little loose without it. Maybe it was the oil substitution?

These are great!  I did not use shortening.  Used butter instead.  I also added some chopped up roasted peanuts just because I had them on hand.

Have made these a couple of times now ... great every time!  Today I made them up with peanut butter blends:  cranberry crunch for one batch and banana granola for another. This was a great twist!  Either way, these cookies are simple and quick, but the smooth flavor belies how easily they come together.  Excellent treat when you need to whip something up with stuff you already have in the pantry!

These cookies were pretty good, yet I did cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup to get more of a peanut butter flavor (which I still wish there was more of... I'm obsessed with PB), increased the oats, and used all unsalted butter.  The cookies came out excellent even with the modifications and they lasted in my house a good while (I probably exceeded the yield because of the size of my cookies) and they had a nice crunch to them with a moist inside.  One or two a day was a very delicious treat!

These are great peanut butter cookies!  I made them just as written except I added a little vanilla (I add vanilla to everything).  I liked that they have more "body" than your run-of-the-mill peanut butter cookie.  I used butter instead of margarine so they didn't spread that much and they were very puffy and soft.  I used a cookie scoop and got about 50-60 cookies.  I did add some chocolate chips to the last couple batches for variety (they were great too).  Great recipe!

Meh.  Not terrible but not fantastic.  Only changes I made was I used butter and added 1 tsp vanilla.  If you want a really good peanut butter cookie with oats try Isa Chandra Moskowitz's Gigantoid Peanut butter cookies.  So much better.

This was a great recipe!  Perfectly soft and chewy and fabulous fresh out of the oven!!  I had doubled the recipe to use up some baking supplies and found that it could have used another 1-1/2 cups of oats but wouldn't change anything else.  I now have a new peanut butter cookie recipe as my go to!  Thanks

Definitely a kid pleasing recipe :)I even tried subbing coconut oil to replace the shortening, which worked well, even with the subtle coconut flavor. Great recipe, dough freezes well too!

So initially these were not great. BUT after cooling and firming up a little they are awesome. Even better the next days which I have never said about a cookie. We did half with mini semi sweet chips, half without. I prefer without but I am not a chocolate lover. Cooking longer made them better too.

Really good! I found them to be a bit too sweet, so if you want use a tad less sugar. Also, one cup of oats isn't enough to make them noticeable! If you add 2 cups instead you get the texture and the flavor coming through much more prominently!

Nice consistency - I would have preferred them to be slightly more chewy, but they definitely weren't too cakey. Good amount of peanut flavor, and the oats added a little extra texture. I used all butter.

It's a great basic recipe.  I was in the mood for Nutella,  so I did a half cup of PB and a half cup of Nutella.  I also added some chopped candy bars. I used butter instead of shortening, and added an extra 1/2 c. of  flour. The end result was pure awesomeness.  Seriously.  :)

I used all butter and no shortening and substituted cookie butter (speculoose) for the peanut butter...so tasty!!!  I am sure the recipe is awesome as is, but I'm excited that the cookie butter worked well in this recipe.  Try it!!

The reviews don't do these cookies justice! First, I modified the recipe by adding a teaspoon of baking powder, 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a teaspoon of pure vanilla.  I creamed all the wet ingredients until completely fluffy and then added the dry ingredients.  A large teaspoon full of dough makes a nice-sized cookie. Ten minutes in the oven was perfect. The cookies are crisp but chewy.  I had a little dough left over, and I used it to ice a few cookies. It was pure decadence!

Out of habit I doubled this cookie recipe and it made about 6 dozen. Yikes!!! More then i needed so I made two dozen just as recipe said, added semi sweet chocolate chips to two more dozen, then added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts to the last couple dozen. All three types are delicious! I let the dough chill for an hour after mixing and they look and taste wonderful. Thanks

Excellent cookie! Light and crisp with just the right amount of chewiness. I used butter instead of margarine and added 1/3 cup more oats and they turned out just perfect. A keeper, for sure!

My boyfriend and I are both peanut butter lovers, and these cookies were no exception! That being said, the oats in these cookies were few and far between, next time I will try adding extra.

I have made these cookies many many times since first seeing recipe.  I add chocolate chips to mine and they are a big hit with everyone!  I also increase the oatmeal from one cup to almost two.  I did try substituting butter for margarine once but they didn't come out as good.

These are fantastic....I used butter instead of margarine, other than that stuck to the recipe.  Only change I would make if I do these again would be to increase the oats by maybe 1/3 a cup or so.

These are so perfect I wish I had more stars!  Beautifully crisp but somehow still chewy they are amazing!  I've started playing with other stuff:  chopped peanuts (or crunch peanut butter) add texture and so do mini chocolate chips (full size don't have time to melt in like the mini's do!)  So so very good!

I'm not a baker and try stay away from sweets. But cravings won this time. These cookies are SO good!!! Very easy to make! Yes, I added crushed peanuts and raisins because that is what my cravings called. Only one thing was lacking is chewiness... Anybody knows how to make more chewy cookies? - maybe less shortening? Still 5 stars cookies!!! Thank you!

This recipe is rather plain... I used a cup of butter instead of shortening and margarine since a cardiologist said they stopped giving chickens margarine to fatten them up since it was causing heart attacks. That was the original purpose of margarine. Anyway, the cookies are good but need, chopped soft peppermints, or chocolate chips with crushed pretzels or cracked peanuts... just a little something.

been making cookies for 50 yrs and it never occurred to me that any cookie could taste better than a choc chip cookie... but these do. found this recipe 3-4 yrs ago and it's amazing. i do use butter-flavored shortening and add an extra 1/2 c of oats... tried adding choc chips one time but it added nothing to the end result (never thought I'd say that about chocolate!) same thing with adding vanilla, tried it and its not needed. also, I use old-fashioned oats because they're "meatier" (thicker) than quick oats, so i let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour to let the thicker oats hydrate (plus i need a break to sit down for a bit.) man o man these cookies are GOOOOD.

I thought the texture was not good.  I did go all butter.  Cookies came out really flat.  The taste was pretty good and I added high quality chocolate chips.  "If" I make again; I'm adding an egg, reducing the sugar by 1/4 and adding 1/2 cup more oats.  Kids & friends liked them though, to me, they're really not presentable.

The oatmeal added nothing to this peanut butter cookie.  Would have preferred either an oatmeal cookie OR a peanut butter cookie.  Nothing was achieved by combining the two.

Great cookie, crunchy on outside chewy in the middle, subtle peanut flavor, not ridiculous like Kraft Foods recipe. It's too bad it took me 10 years to find this recipe, it's a good one.

No modifications needed. Chewy, soft, sweet and a bit salty. I love those contrasts. Thanks, Michele, for sharing.

The only thing I changed was I used 1/4 cup shortening instead of 1/2 cup. This was only because I only had 1//4  left. These actually turned out PERFECT! Considering the way they taste with the 1/4 cup, any more than that would ruin them. These will NOT last long and I think will become a new favorite in my house.

This recipe was yummy and easy!  Cookies are soft and chewy.  Best to let them cool a little on the pan before putting them on the rack to avoid them breaking.  Once they cool, they firm up a bit but are still so chewy.  I used 1.5 cups oats.  Great recipe!

Just made these Cookies. Soft and chewy! the oat meal goes great with the peanut butter. I only added an extra egg. Too add more protein so i could use them for a breakfast cookie.

These cookies are absolutely tickity-boo!  I took some suggestions from some of the other reviews.  I added more oats (not the quick cook kind) about an extra 3/4 cup, and about 1/2 cup more flour.  Also cooled the batter for the second batch and they didn't flatten out. I also used butter rather than shortening.  Great cookies!

I made these for my son's cross country team. The kids weren't overly fond of them but all the adults loved them. It was a nice change of pace from regular peanut butter cookies. And, for someone like me who isn't peanut butter crazy, I preferred them over regular peanut butter cookies.

Super yummy! Deleted the shortening (shortening just grosses me out) and used 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) of light butter. Also added just under 1/4 cup applesauce to replace some of the fat. The cookies still tasted buttery and rich. Also used 2 cups of oatmeal and chocolate chips. These really couldn't possibly be better. I need to hide them from myself. My daughter couldn't get enough. Mmmmmm.

This turned out a bit dry for me. Maybe I cooked them a couple minutes too long? I also used a natural peanut butter that was drier and did not use instant oats, but regular oats. They were still tasty, just a bit dry.

Great recipe! I used old fashioned rolled oats, butter instead of margarine, and all white sugar because I didn't have brown on hand. These cookies are soft, delicious and not too sweet.

I changed nothing and the cookies turned out so good especially with a tall glass of cold milk.. Mmm. Imagine if you added some kind of chip, chocolate, butterscotch, caramel, white chocolate and nuts! But this recipe is so good you really don't need it. Thanks this is a keeper!

Such a good recipe! I followed it exactly as written and they came out great. I didn't measure the cookies before dropping them and so I think I made them slightly larger than a teaspoon, but I still got about 40 cookies. Even with them being a bit oversized 10 minutes in the oven was perfect leaving the middle soft and the outside a bit crispy. The oatmeal can't really be tasted but I think it does soak up the rest of the fat nicely as well as add a slight chewiness to the cookies. I refrigerated the dough between batches to keep it firmer. Great PB cookie!!

I have made this cookie recipe twice. Used my Kitchen Aid mixer to blend the ingredients. Smooth texture and tasty.  Perfect cookie. Only modifications I made: 1 batch I used chunky peanut butter; and used all butter instead of butter/shortening in both batches. This will be my go to cookie in the future. I already have a request for a 3rd batch.

At first I wasn't really impressed--as I was baking, I tested the batter (as I often do) and it was bland and tasted odd, like something was missing.  I went though the ingredients list again, and I hadn't forgotten anything (I'm a total novice and have done that several times, only to realize it when my dish is in the oven).  I baked as directed, let the cookies cool, and tried them again--all in all, very good.  These aren't totally wowwy wow, like something you'd bring to a pot luck, but they are an excellent every day cookie--not too sweet, very basic, and delicious.

These are delicious! I love the combo of oats and peanut butter. To be fair, I didn't have quite enough butter, so I made up the difference with extra shortening. I'm sure the flavor would be much better with the proper ratio of butter. I also added chocolate chips. Yummy! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I found 12 minute to be the perfect cooking time for me (at sea level) and after cooling, the cookies just slid off my airbake pans. They rose slightly and didn't spread at all. The end result was a high, soft, somewhat crumbly cookie. I will definitely make these again!

These were addictive!  I only made one change and substituted slow-cooking oats.  
This is my favourite Peanut Butter Cookie recipe.

this recipe is fantastic! Followed it exactly 'cept I put the oatmeal in the blender and pulverized it before adding to the mix so my children wouldn't know it was in the cookies! This recipe is a keeper. I will be making it again and again..

I really really wanted to like this recipe. Unfortunately I used the suggestions from several of the reviewers and is probably why they did not turn out...I should've stuck to the original recipe. These as made did not meet any of the criteria IMO, for a good cookie. Too dry, too hard, too fall apart, too small [they do not spread]. If I ever make these again I'll stick strictly to the original recipe. If these do not turn out for you try the no bake chocolate peanut butter oatmeal treats...they are fabulous and 'extremely' easy. Kids love them!

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever! I didn't change anything but did add 1/2 cup chopped roasted, salted almonds which gave it a nice little crunch. I think this is my favorite cookie recipe now.  And I also like how you didn't have to roll them into a ball and  press with a fork , just drop by spoonful.

These are the best. I like to make them a little on the salty side, which gives them a sweet and salty taste. Use crunchy all natural Jif.

These were decent, but even though their texture was fantastic (Making sure the batter stays cold before baking is a must!!), the shortening gave them a greasy quality I just wasn't wild about.  I added a little vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon and clove, but didn't change it otherwise.  If I were to make them again, I would exchange the shortening for butter and add more peanut butter and oatmeal, as there didn't seem to be enough of either.

Loved these cookies.  I wouldn't make any changes.  I did use the shortening, which added to the slight crispness on the outside of the cookie, but the inside was perfect--just how a peanut butter cookie should be.  I thought the oats were perfect.  Next time I will try crunchy peanut butter.

WOW!!! Yummy YUMMY! these cookies are wonderful, they turned out very soft.  After mixing the dough I put it in the frig. for about an hour so that the dough would get firm. And then I used a tablespoon scooper, this made all cookies the same size.

Did not like this at all.  Very salty, flat as a pancake, gooey on the inside.  Not my kind of cookie.  Wish I had made my old bhg recipe instead.

My very picky 6 year old's exact words were "Mommy I love 'em!!"

Because I don't believe in giving 5 stars to a recipe I changed it gets 4 stars....
I read about 20 reviews before I started and about half said it needed more peanut butter so i added an extra half cup of peanut butter.  I omitted the shortning I just don't like the texture it can give things and put unsweetened applesauce in it instead(this will also lower the fat and keep them soft).  I put a 1/4 cup less of each sugar and ALWAYS use dark brown sugar.  When putting in the flour I sifted together 1 cup of all purpose with 1/2 cup of whole wheat(to make it a little healthier...next time I will make it 3/4 of each.
Definitely a keeper, thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I forgot...omit the salt...I used salted butter and that was the perfect amount of saltiness!

This recipe was alright.  They didn't come out super sweet, which was good, but I still wasn't all that impressed.  After cooking them for 11 minutes, I ended up having to keep them in for the full 15 and they still looked underdone.  I would have bumped up the oats by at least another 1/2C.  They added good texture, but weren't prominent.  They did however come out very soft and chewy.  Not bad, but I'll be trying a different one this time.

This is a great recipe... a bit sweet, but the guys in the house love them.. the recipe made 36 nice size cookies and there are only 15 left after the first 30 minutes from cooking them!  I will cut back on the sugar next time.

This recipe was a big hit.  I just added 1/2 cups pecans and cut salt back to 1/2 tsp since the butter I used (instead of margarine)was salted. Excellent recipe!!!

This is a really good recipe with modifications. I used about 1 1/2 cups oats and butter instead of shortening and margarine. I made half of the batch plain and added chocolate chips to the other half. These are really good and chewy, with lots of peanut butter flavor, but I found them a little salty. I am a big fan of salt so I didn't mind, but I think others may find them too salty. The chocolate chips helped balance the salt, but if I make them again without chocolate chips, I'll reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.

Phenomenal cookies!!! The recipe's great as is, but here are some adjustments I've made: I cut the white sugar a bit, swapped in a mashed banana for one of the eggs, and added chocolate chips. A splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon would add some nice flavour, too.

I didn't have brown sugar so I used all white. They were a bit too sweet. I used 1 cup butter instead of shortening. The cookies were soft and crunchy. Perfect with milk.

Used all natural almond butter with one more cup of oats. Very good. Chewy with a little crunch. Great for a breakfast cookie or to put in my son's lunch.

Very nice and chewy when warm. After it cools, it's just another PB cookie. I think I prefer another PB cookie recipe from this site.

I used real butter and added M&M's. Very very good. Try not to overbake. That pan was crumbly and not very good (my fault) My husband took extra's to work and they were gone in a second.

There's no reason to use anything other than butter to make these, unless, maybe, you are a heathen. XD But aside from that, I just love these. They are my new go to recipe for cookies.

Made these for my students for the last night of class. Instead of small cookies, I rolled balls about the size of my palm and made huge ones. They went over very well--in fact, two weeks later, I ate the last one (having forgotten it), and it was still pretty doggone delicious.

The most amazing peanut butter cookies ever. Use butter instead of the margarine and shortening and whole wheat pastry flour. Also, cut the white sugar down to half a cup. Delish!!!!!

I used this wonderful recipe as a guide to make GF cookies.  I substituted hardened coconut oil for the shortening, since we don't keep shortening in the house; Gluten Free baking mix for the  all purpose flour, self made peanut butter for the sugar filled alternative, and GF oats.  I also put in 1/4C of toffee pieces, and dark chocolate pieces that I cut from a bar of 70% Cacao bar.  They turned out FABULOUSLY and we are all enjoying the slight modifications made.

Wonderful Recipe!  I followed it almost exactly (decreased the white sugar a bit and used butter instead of margarine since I was out of margarine).  The cookies turned out soft and tender and delicious.

These cookies had a wonderful taste and texture. The only thing I changed was I put 1 1/2 cups of oats in them. When I brought them to work, many of them were cracked. I had to let them sit for a long time on the cookie sheet before lifting them off. Is there a trick to these cookies to make them not so fragile? Should I add all butter and not use shortening? Please help! I want to make these again!

This is the way I have always made peanut butter cookies. But I misplaced my recipe and so I thank you...this is pretty much it! I wouldn't change a thing. Someone has probably already posted this, but one thing I do for that authentic pb cookie look is to flatten the blobs of dough slightly with the tines of a fork prior to baking. Also need to use heaping tbsp sized balls of dough for a good sized cookie.
Wonderful! Thanks again!

A few years ago my husband came up with the idea to make oatmeal peanut butter cookies with instant flavored oatmeal.  Specifically the Maple Brown Sugar and/or the Cinnamon Roll flavors.  But he just always threw things in without measuring and they turned out wonderful.  I however, can not bake like that.  So I am so happy to find this recipe!  I subbed the instant flavored oatmeal for the quick oats (specifically a new kind that is out that is unsweetened which meant I didn't have to change the recipe called for sugar amounts, but I imagine that I would have to lessen the sugar amounts if the instant oatmeal where the presweetened kind).  And they taste just like the ones my husband throws together (I also didn't have any margarine, so I used butter instead of the margarine and shortening, like others have said but I'm sure it would be fine with the other)

I was worried that they wouldn't turn out because I was using some organic PB that needed to be used but they turned out nice & crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. I also used butter in replace of the poison...I mean margarine. I did have to flatten the dough balls on the pan because the dough was pretty firm, but I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Good but not the best. The cookies were way too salty and that's with using unsalted butter and low salt peanut butter. They were also too runny so I added another cup of oats. In the future I will use maybe 1/4 tsp of salt.

I don't use either margarine or shortening, so I substituted butter and lard.  I used evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar.  These cookies were perfect!

I admit that I used all margarine instead of the Crisco, only because after I started I realized I only had butter flavored Crisco. After making the first batch, I decided they were good, but I still added more oats and a cup of chocolate chips to the rest of the dough. Wow! These are good.

I don't rate often, but these were awesome. I didn't have any brown sugar and I didn't have any molasses so I went with all white. Also I added 1/2c PB and 1/2c oats. And I added 1 tsp vanilla after the eggs, just something I'm used to doing. I used room temp butter, all butter no shortening. I had no proble,s with runniness.

These cookies were excellent!! I added chocolate chips and vanilla and used butter instead of margarine and shortening.  I also used  1/4 whole wheat flour and threw in an extra handful of oatmeal and whole wheat flour when I was mixing in the chocolate chips.  Before baking, I refridgerated my dough for about an hour. The result was an amazing cookie!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will be making these often!

Yum! Really good. Worked fine with natural peanut butter and butter in place of margarine and old fashioned oats instead of quick.

My kids really liked these.  Hard to get them to like an oatmeal cookie but these did the trick.  I used chunky peanut butter and added peanut butter chips to the mix. I used butter in place of the margarine. Nice texture and very peanut buttery!

Turned out perfect! I did the recipe exactly as it says, except I didn't have any baking soda, so I just used that for more baking powder. These weren't too sweet, just perfect! I've got some dough in the freezer now! LOVE these and will be using this recipe time and time again!!!

I baked this for my extended family  - they loved them! 
I did follow suggestions most of zjsgram's suggestions of 1tsp vanilla, 1 3/4 C flour, 1 1/2 C oats, 1 C crunch peanut butter, 1/2 C creamy peanut butter, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 C butter & 1 pkg semi sweet chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper.

These are good. I made them plain, with chocolate chips and then with crushed peanuts. The chocolate chip were the best by far. Good easy recipe.

I made theses cookie and they came out nothing like the picture I dont know if thats a fake picture but they came out nothing like it...anywho if that is an actual photo than i did something wrong because I was confused when to add the oats..but most likely I will make the cookies again and see what I did wrong because I want to find the perfect peanut butter cookies that have a little extra something and this recipe seems perfect. I just a little practice with it:)

I didn't want to alter the rating so I put 4 stars.. Everyone wants a spin on a recipe so here's mine. I used real UNsalted butter rather than margarine. Added half a tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon only because it's the holiday season and I didn't use quick oats, regular ones. I let it cook for 10 minutes on parchment paper. This was a wonderful recipe because I enjoy soft and moist cookies and this was! If anyone said it was dry they're so wrong! This isn't a legit oatmeal cookie because there isn't that many oats, but, if you add more oats, then I can see where your cookie would get dry. If you add chocolate chips then it will overpower the peanut butter. Very good base recipe to play with other ingredients.

I have made this recipe too many times to count.  They are a hit with everyone young and old.  The only changes I made was to add butter for the margarine and shorting, vanilla essence, whold bunch of chocolate chips and xtra oats (old fashion variety- I feel they hold the cookie togethere better).

Worked fine for me - but being in NZ we dont use shortening that often, so I dropped that and the margarine and replaced with 150g butter. (and used salted butter, so dropped the salt).
Made 3 trays worth of cookies -so goes a long way.

This may be my new favorite  cookie recipe! I used butter instead of the margarine/shortening combo and it was fine. I also took the suggestion to up the oats. I used a combo of chunky and smooth peanut butter and threw in about half a bag of chocolate chips. Chilling the dough in between batches as suggested by another reviewer really helped them maintain  their integrity. I made these quite large, about a 1/4 cup size and baking at 17 minutes made a wonderfully large crispy and chest cookie! I am in love!

I have never commented before on here but how can anyone say that this recipe is horrible or say that it was great and then post a plethora of changes they made to make them better! These cookies are brilliant as they are and if you don't like it....move on and find one you do like! GREAT RECIPE!!!!!

These cookies are really good! They had the perfect texture and were so light. Thank you for the recipe! Here is what happened in my kitchen:  If you don't have margarine (I was out) you can use butter. It added a nice flavor to these cookies too. The only thing I would do next time is cut back a bit on the salt to 1/2 tsp if I am using salted butter. They were done in 13 minutes and I cooled them a bit before lifting off the cookie sheet or they would break. They came out to 4 dozen and a few to spare!

i don't normally love peanut butter cookies, i'll pass one up any day. but these are really amazing. i kid you not. i used half dark brown sugar, half light, (the dark adds a lot of depth), added some vanilla extract, doubled the oats, used butter (shorting and margerine are scary), and also added 2 or 3 Tbs. of Trader Joes cookie butter. These are irresistible. Next time, I'd like to try subbing half the butter with coconut oil and adding some cinnamon, I think that would take these over the top, and they're pretty darn close already.

Four stars because of changes I made-but these are the best cookies I've made! I used 1/2 cup salted butter and 1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature. I also substituted some of the all purpose flour for whole wheat and I put in two cups of oats. I also only used a tiny pinch of salt and put the dough on parchment paper-cooking for 10 minutes. These were definitely amazing and made a TON of cookies. I will be using this recipe from now on!

Delicious! I used butter instead of margarine & they came out great. I was looking for a quick & tastey cookie recipe with ingredients that I already had around my kitchen, & this worked out perfectly!

Awesome! After reading some of the reviews, I made the following changes: 

- Use all margarine instead of 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening
- Cut down on white sugar to 1/4 cup
- Add 2 cups chocolate chips
- Doubled oats

They were great, nice PB taste and really soft and chewy. Next time I will completely omit the white sugar and not double the oats

As it turned out ... I thought I had peanut butter in the pantry but only had Nutella.   OMG --was this ever an awesome "substitution"!!  As other reviews suggested, I added more oats and used unsalted butter instead of shortening and margarine.   You just can't go wrong with this recipe ...even if you have to make some personal changes.  Just make sure your flour and baking soda is fresh as it could cause you to have  a flatter cookie.   I keep mine wrapped tightly in the freezer and only take out only what I need ... seems to work!

These cookies turned out jsut as I like: soft and puffy though I made some changes to the recipe. I used tahini instead of peanut butter, ignored shortening and used butter instead and omitted white sugar totally, i.e. used just brown sugar given in the recipe without increasing its amount for the white. In spite of cutting back on sugar the cookies were sweet just right without being oversweet. Tahini gave its very rich fragrance which is especially cozy in those cold rainy days ))))

Great recipe!  I cut the recipe in half.  Substituted coconut oil for the shortening and added 1/2 cup organic chocolate chips.  I baked them for 14 minutes.  Quick, easy...delicious!  Thank you!

Five stars! Only two changes were butter(make sure it's chilled when you add it in...) instead of margarine and shortening, and increasing the oats to 1 3/4 cup...only took about 12 minutes in the oven, then cooled on a baking sheet for another 5...Perfection in a cookie! LUV IT :)

These were absolutely wonderful! I tried to make these diabetic friendly and a bit more nutritious. I used Land o Lakes light butter instead of margarine, Splenda brown sugar, Splenda sugar, crunchy peanut butter, whole wheat pastry flour (If you haven't tried it, you need too! Makes a world of difference. I order mine from amazon.com. Bake everything with it. Tastes better than white flour), whole wheat oats, and I added a tsp of Burbon vanilla flavoring. Next time I will add peanut butter chips.

Oh you have to try these. Easy and wonderful. I have tried different types of peanut butter cookie recipes but none as good as these.  All my friends want this recipe so I sent them to allrecipes.com.  I just love this site. Off to try another cookie, maybe oatmeal.

This is my new favorite peanut butter cookie.   Only  substituted part butter, part coconut oil and part olive oil.  They have a perfect mix of crunchy/chewy. (And that way I feel better about eating them every day.)

Delicious! Next time i would double the oatmeal and peanut butter. A more rugged verson. I loved the way they spread out. I like flat cookies, not cake-like. I will never make my mother's peanut butter cookie again. I really prefer these.

Oh my goodness. These are the best peanut butter cookie I have ever had.  They are wonderful just as written, however I did add a bag of reeses peanut butter chips to it. OOOOh peanutty goodness.  So easy.  After the batter was done I put it in a gallon baggie and put it in the fridge for a couple hours.  I also use Reynolds heavy duty Non stick foil. I had no problem with cookies spreading at all.  I also only left my cookies in the oven for 10 minutes.  When they come out I leave them on the cookie sheet to cool while I cycle the next batch into the oven.  I also have much more success with all cookie  in general when I cook them only one sheet at a time....These are the tips to my success at baking cookies:)

These are delicious! I did not have shortening/margarine so I used unsalted butter in place. I added chocolate to a few of them, but they really don't need anything extra they are already great.  Enough peanut butter flavor with a great texture!

very tasty according to my 16 year old son. I used natural peanut butter, real butter, old fashioned oats and raw sugar in place of both sugars. I also used no salt and a low sodium substitute for baking soda. I added a litter more oats because some else said they did and it was fine. My son thinks more peanut butter next time. We like these!

I followed the recipe almost to the letter.  I only added 1/2 cup of raisins.  These are really good!  The family loved them!  For some reason, it took 20 min to cook them.  This batch yielded 30 cookies about 3" to 4" in diam.  I will be making these again, and I will also add chocolate chips & chopped pecans.

I followed the directions but used butter instead of margarine.  I used a cookie scoop and they were all beautiful, worthy of a bakery!  They tasted great too.   Next time I am going to try using an all natural peanut butter (just peanuts and salt) as I think that will make them even peanutier.  I did put the scooped dough in the freezer for a while before baking and think this helped them not flatten too much.

My family loves these cookies.  The only thing I change is using butter in place of margarine.  This is a fantastic recipe.  They turn out perfect every time.  I am making them again today and threw in a cup of mini choc. chips for fun.

Excellent, I might try next time a little less salt.  Left on cookie sheet for 1 minute after coming out of oven.  In oven for 12-13 minutes.

WOW! These are great!  I used the suggestion of upping the oatmeal to 2 cups and adding the almond extract and it tastes fantastic! Now the test will be for the kids and hubby when they get home.

I followed some of the reviewers' recommendations and did a little bit of extra flour and oats.
The flavor is good. But the texture is a little bit too dry and crunchy for my taste to be a 5 star recipe.
Worth making though.

These are seriously amazing. I substituted applesauce for the shortening because I want a healthier cookie, but the consistency was great. The cookies were peanut buttery, soft, a bit cakey, and had a delicious flavor!

These were great! Everyone in my family loved them. I prefer making small cookies, so I was able to make about 75 mini cookies out of this recipe. Make sure you add another 1/2 cup of oats though-they're needed!

Nothing extraordinary, but overall a very good basic cookie recipe.  The brown sugar and oats lend a warm, homey flavor to the cookies.  
Don't be tempted to increase the size of the cookies - 1 Tbsp really does result in the best cookie!
I replaced butter for the margarine because I find that baked goods made with margarine tend to have a greasy, oily texture.

This is a great recipe!.  I used all butter and I actually used ALMOND BUTTER instead of peanut butter.  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I added an extra cup of oatmeal and added 1/4 cup ground flax seed.  I also added 1 tsp of almond extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  To about half, I added butterscotch chips.  I liked the ones with butterscotch chips more it tastes great plain too.   I bought a jar of almond butter but I hate how it tastes alone but it tastes great in this cookie.

These were good.  They are quick and easy and everything in the ingredients list are things I always have on hand.  My kids loved them and they generally dislike pb or oatmeal cookies, so for them to like a cookie that combined the two was a miracle!

Simply a great cookie.  We added chopped leftover chocolate easter eggs, cooked up a small batch and froze the rest in small balls ... great to cook up for a quick easy bedtime snack.

As is, the recipe is pretty good. I did find the cookies a bit salty though. After making it again, I tweaked a few things. I only added 1/2 tsp of salt, added 1/2 cup more oatmeal and a tsp of vanilla. I also put some reeses pieces on top of them. So yummy and chewy! Definitely will make these again.

Awesome cookies.  I used all butter instead of the shortening and margarine, so my cookies were a little flatter than the ones in the picture.  But they taste so good.  We love the addition of the oats in this classic peanut butter cookie.  Texture and flavor are just wonderful!

Excellent cookie.  I didn't use shortening or margarine, but room temperature butter that I beat for about 5 minutes.  Also, I didn't use quick-cooking oats, but old-fashioned and let sit out for about an hour.  Not too crunchy like usual peanut butter cookies and chewy center. Brought them to a get together 2 days after I made them and everyone thought they were amazing.  Will be making again.

These are fine cookies.. like some others, I too think next time I'll double the oatmeal and reduce the sugar and salt to suit my particular tastes, but they do work as they are.  I did use whole wheat flour so I added about a Tbs of milk to the mix to account for the extra moisture absorbtion

Very good cookie! Slightly crisp outside and moist, chewy inside at 12 min (in my oven) . I added just a dash of cinnamon and a touch of vanilla, purely because of my personal preference. I followed the actual recipe exactly. This will be the only peanut butter cookie recipe I use. It is far better than the one I have been using for years. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Absolutely delicious. My husband doesn't like PB cookies all that much, but loved these. They are light and soft - I did add more oatmeal, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I just made these and really liked them.  I used recipe except I used 1 cup butter instead of shortening and margarine.  I also added milk chocolate chips.  Next time I make them I will add a little more salt to balance out the sweetness of the chips.

Made these at my husband's request for oatmeal PB cookies. I didn't think I would like them, but I did! However, I also added about 1/2 cup more PB (and used all natural, salt free PB to reduce sugar), slightly reduced sugar as well and added an extra cup of oats. The flour I used was half unbleached all purpose and half wheat pastry flour. SUPER yummy! We all love them, especially my kids!!!

I thought these were great!  I used all shortening (plus six teaspoons of water) because I needed them to be lactose free.  I increased the PB by a half cup and the oats by a quarter cup.  Mine cooked for twelve minutes and were perfect.

Oh my gosh these were good! I followed the recipe exactly, but the dough was a little thin and sticky, so i added an additional 1/2 cup of oats, I also added about 3/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips just for fun. 13 minutes was perfect for baking, they are chewy and crunchy and peanut-buttery. What a great recipe.

This is by far one of the best cookie recipe I have made in a long time. I followed the recipe exactly. Baked for 10 minutes; let them cool on the pan for 3-4 minutes before transferring them to racks to cool.  Slightly crisp outside, chewy & moist on the inside.  Absolutely delicious and will definately be making these again often!

Don't change a thing.  These are a real nice break from the usual .   They bake up very even in color, texture and size and stay crisp for a very long time.   Our family liked the fact that they were not overpowering in the peanut department.

Exactly what I was looking for. I used old fashioned oats and it gave the cookie more body. I also drizzled chocolate on top for a delicious, decorative touch.

Fabulous! Just made them for a get-together and they were gobbled up! They are so tasy and I like the extra chewiness the oatmeal adds to regular peanut butter cookies! Excellent recipe for holidays and parties! This recipe made 60 cookies if you follow the teaspoon size suggestion!

These are awesome first time around! I did do as other people had suggested, an additional 1/2 Cup of PB (crunchy), total of 2 Cups of rolled oats (not quick) and a splash of vanilla. Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I took these cookies to a Bible study class, and people told me these were the best cookies they'd ever eaten.  When I bring cookies to church now, people always ask, "Are these THE cookies???"  Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor of these was really good, I didn't care for the texture at all, though. I used shortening and butter because I didn't have margarine. I prefer my cookies chewier, and you just don't get that when you use shortening. Next time I make them I will use only butter and see how they come out.

These were great. I followed the recipe as written and got 69, slightly chewy, absolutely delicious cookies. I guess my teaspoons were smaller than the recipe's. I also only baked my for 8 minutes and found that to be operfect for the size of cookie I made. I also really liked that they were drop cookies, so I didn't have to roll the dough into little balls; much simpler. Thanks for a great recipe.

Definitely reduce the salt to 1/2t. A full teaspoon is just too much. I added about 1/2 t of vanilla just because. Next time I make these I will reduce the salt and then I know I'll have THE perfect cookie.

awesome recipe, the only changes i made were using 1c unsalted butter & an addt'l 1/2 c of oats. i baked mine for 13mins as each cookie used 1/4 c of the dough.  i will reduce the sugar next time as well.

These are excellent, chewy cookies!  I made them with the following changes: 1 cup of butter instead of shortening and margerine, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour, 1.5 cups of oats, chocolate chips, and walnuts.  VERY GOOD!!

Best texture ever in a peanut butter cookie.  this is now my new go-to recipe.  As other suggested, I added half again as much peanut butter, and twice as much oatmeal (old fashioned, because that was all I had).  To half the dough I added some chocolate chips.  My favorite.

I just assembled all of my ingredients to make these cookies AGAIN. My only adjustment was to increase the recipe to make 120 cookies. I first took them to a dinner for the children who are very hard to please. One wanted peanut butter the other oatmeal. I searched and found this one. They were a big hit and the parents were amazed the kids liked the same cookie. This was a first. Of course now my husband requests them all the time. I made no changes except to make sure I just mixed the oats until just combined. Michele, Thanks for sharing this recipe. This is mine and my sisters favorite peanut butter cookie recipe now.

Hopefully this review will clarify some of the differences between other reviews.  I read several of them first before I tried this, and while everyone liked them, several people thought the cookies needed something more. Here's my input on the matter:  The cookie recipe as it is here is GREAT!  Everyone who tried it LOVED it, including myself, my family, and some friends.  However, I would say if one wanted to actually taste the oatmeal a bit more, that 1 cup is a little shy.  In future, I may add another cup of oatmeal.  That said, the cookie already stands as a great one, and I'm sure will be enjoyed by more of my family members and friends.  This one is going on the list of favorites for our family!

Yummy!!  I made these yesterday.  I added 2 cups of chocolate chips and  added 2 cups of oatmeal instead of 1 by mistake.  They turned out Great!!  Definitely don't over cook them.  My first batch came out really undercooked so I cooked the rest a little longer and the ones that looked undercooked are better today.

This cookie was delicious!  My mother and I both agree it's the best cookie I have ever made!  I didn't change the recipe at all, except for substituting butter for margarine because we didn't have any. I also made sure my fat was chilled and my cookie sheet was cool, like other reviewers recommended, so my cookies didn't spread and thin.  This recipe is fantastic just the way it is!  Made cute, dollar sized cookies!  Not hard, not soft--crisp and delicious!  Will definitely make again.

These cookies were amazing!  I am not quite the best baker, but these seemed idiot proof enough for even me!  Like others, I did replace the shortening with butter because it freaks me out.  I also used organic whole wheat flour and natural peanut butter to make it healthier!  After cooking these, I sprinkled a few with cinnamon which i think was a wonderful touch.  next time I may just add a little cinnamon to the batter while cooking.  I have made these a few times now and always get complements!  Great recipe!

I was looking for a "breakfast cookie" this morning before Baseball practice and a full day of activities, so I whipped these up very quickly and they came out beautifully! I halved the recipe, only used butter and added a few chocolate chips and they are fabulous, I wish I had made the whole recipe now!!

Excellent and versatile. The peanut butter flavor was very present, perfectly sweet. I made this three different ways with the recipe followed exactly (I always use parchment). 1) Baking time same as recipe. 2) In muffin cups, slightly longer cook time, mini chocolate chip morsels on top only. 3) Slightly larger regular cookies on baking sheet with mini chocolate morsels baked in. All three were completely different. Excellent!

This was a pretty good recipe, but next time i'll for sure at least half the amount of salt.  I did find it way to salty for my taste.  I took other reviewers suggestions and added another 1/2 c of oats as well.  I make the frosting from another PB cookie and swirled on top and they were cute, but didn't keep very well.

These were great, went with other reviewers and added in more oats to make them more oatmeal-cookieish. They were a hit at Christmas

My husband LOVES these cookies!  He insists on having them in the house at all times.    My modifications included: used 1 cup salted butter instead of shortening/margerine, and omitted the tsp of salt.  I doubled the oats to 2 cups, and added a splash of vanilla.  We both love that they are chewy and delicious.

these are in the oven now and they smell YUM-O!  I added 2 tsp vanilla, 1 pkg instant vanilla pudding (apparently for moisture), 2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder and also some chopped pecans (probably 1 cup).  I think next time I will also add more oatmeal like the reviews suggest....ITA 1 cup just doesn't seem to be enough

I believe this is the best cookie I have ever had. I did use salted butter only , no margarine or shortening. I also used about a half cup more of oats. This will absolutely be made on a regular basis. The sweet salty ratio was just perfect !

By far the ABSOLUTE BEST peanut butter cookies! I made a batch for my husband because he loves peanut butter cookies, but I absolutely hate them... until now. I figured I could stomach a sample cookie enough to taste one right after it came out of the oven just to make sure it was pallatable. It was so delicious; needless to say that the cookies didn't last for a full day. So, I made a second batch for myself the second time around, and they still didn't last for a full day. I have tried many recipes from this site, but this is the only one that inspired a review! (so far, at least)  Try this and love it. It is not overwhelming with peanut butter. It is such a flavorfully balanced treat!

These needed some time once browned to sit and cool to harden.  Once that happenned they tasted nice.  Mine cooked for 15 minutes.  I rolled them in     white sugar before cooking too.

I made these with butter instead of the combination of shortening and butter. They didn't taste like peanut butter or like oatmeal.

I wanted to make oatmeal raisins but when I realized we had no raisins I looked for an alternative.  I think these were very yummy as does my boyfriend. I used half/half whole wheat/white flour. Cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp, used 2 cups oats and threw in a little extra pb (half smooth half natural) as others suggested and added a little vanilla.   I also bake often with the crisco butter flavored stick so I used that (1 cup) instead of shortening and butter combo, and added a little water (under 1/4 cup - this is what the crisco calls for when substituting for butter)  My oven runs a little hot so they were good at 9 minutes. Let then cool on the cookie sheet for a few before transferring to cooling rack. Also added chocolate chips to half the batch.  Will make again.

These were great!  Made a few tweaks ... omitted the shortening, used 1/2 cup each of the sugars, used whole wheat flour and 2 cups of oats.  Still very tender and tasty!

Very tasty!! I used all butter, as opposed to margarine and shortening, used 2 cups of oats and threw in some chocolate chips. Also, my flour is premixed as half white/half whole wheat, so that's obviously what I used. :) They were a big hit!! Actually made a decent quantity too. The only thing I think I'll do different next time is use Crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth. Thanks for a yummy recipe! :)

These turned out wonderfully!  They're delicious, perfectly crunchy around the edges and soft in the middle, and they look beautiful.   I used a chunky peanut butter (though I guess I would consider it more semi-chunky!) and used all butter instead of shortening or margarine.    I will definitely be making these again.

These were pretty good. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars, is because I think the salt could easily be dropped to only 1/2 teaspoon. Other than that, they were nice and chewie. I added 1/2 cup of choco chips. These went over great with my kids!

Per other advice...in place of shortening/margerine, I used 1 stick of unsalted and 1 stick of salted butter & increased oats to 2 cups. I made these 2 ways, one was plain (as recipe), another batch was with Ghiradelli choc chips, and a 3rd batch w/ Hershey Kisses. The plain & Ghiradelli batches I flattened batter w/ glass into a semi-flat circle. Shaped perfectly. For Hershey Kiss batch -- as the cookies were beginning to cool, I popped a Hershey kiss in the center of each. As the kiss started to melt, I pushed the top into the center (careful to keep the point intact). Looks/tastes like a gourmet cookie! Was repeatedly asked for recipe. Forever cookie!

Both my son and husband gave this a thumbs up!  I used whole wheat flour in place of white and added chocolate chips to half of the batter, but other than that I made this recipe as stated.  Will make again.

YUMMM. These are so good. The only thing I did different from the recipe was that I used butter instead of margarine (personal preference). Also, I added about a cup and a half of chocolate chips. These disappeared QUICK.

Awesome cookies!  I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1/2 cup more oats and they were sooooo perfect.  Thanks so much for the recipe and all the suggestions from others.

These are good cookies and the batch made 56 cookies. I did add a bag of Chocolate Chips to the mix and up-ed the oatmeal to 1.5 cups. The peanut butter is barely noticeable. Maybe add a bit more?

excellent cookie. My husband after a busy day said  he wanted oatmeal cookies with peanut butter. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I did not have any shortening, so I just used margerine. That made them nice and soft and chewy, just the way he likes them, want me to try it with some coconut the next time. Definitely a keeper, and so much better than just plain old peanut butter cookies. thanks so much for the recipe.

Loved this recipe! I used rolled oats rather then quick and I added a bit of crunchy peanut butter along with the smooth. They were perfectly chewy and just enough of both flavors. I did take a suggestion to add vanilla.

Very soft, very good! I added some vanilla. I also tried adding some jam to the top of some of them (not a good idea, trust me) I will make these again, they are easy and delicious.

These were great!  Used butter in place of the shortening and margarine.  Added an additional 1/2 cup of oats and added milk chocolate chips to half the batch.  They came out just perfect.  Oh, I also added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon.  Not sure the cinnamon made a difference so probably won't use it next time.  I'm sending some to my son who is away at school.  I'm hoping he likes them!

This is a good basic recipe. Certainly easy enough to whip together fast. I hosted a 14 year old from France this summer and we made these again and again and again. Ornella Our French guest couldn't get enough of these and making these over and over became part of our memory while hosting her. I however am still searching for THE PEANUT BUTTER cookie to DIE for recipe... I'll keep baking!

I really enjoyed these.  I used butter instead of margarine and did use the shortening.  I took the suggestion of adding 2 cups of oatmeal instead of 1.  Glad I did. They do break apart easily though, probably because of the amount of oatmeal added.  Will make again.

This was a great cookie, not like cake and not too crisp. I gave it four stars because I also added more oats and some dates for texture. My two year old would not stop eating them.

Excellent cookie!!!  Since I don't use shortening or margarine, I used one stick of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil plus 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also did not have quick oats, and used regular rolled oats with no problem.  From previous suggestions, I upped the oats to 1.5 cups as well, plus added in some chocolate chips.  My kids went crazy for these cookies.  Next time I'm adding flax.

This is the first recipe I have rated and I am pleased to give it 5 stars! I followed advice and used 2 cups of oats. My daughter helped me so we made little cookies and put the rest of the mix in the fridge for later (I think I will try adding chocolate chips to these!)

Fantastic!  I've made these several times and they never last long.  The edges are crispy and the center is soft - yummy!  The only change I made was to use real butter and I put in a splash of vanilla extract.  Although they are wonderful made as is!!

Fantastic!  these have a great classic peanut butter cookie taste.  I love the hint of oatmeal.  These taste like the girl scout cookies without the cream filling.  I had to give these away so I could stop eating them!

Wonderful cookie!  Made it just the way it calls for.  Used margarine as instructed instead of using butter as I always do in other cookie recipes.  The oatmeal gives the cookie such a soft chewiness in the center while the outside is slightly crunchy.  Very good peanut butter flavor.  I will make this again!

Very good recipe and easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I am waiting to give 5 stars to the one cookie recipe that finally helps me to not make flat cookies.  Probably not this recipe's fault, just the baker!

This is a wonderful recipe exactly as printed!  I always try a recipe without variations the first time, then make adjustments to my own liking the next time. BUT this is perfect as is!  A PB cookie so moist you can really enjoy them even if you don't have a glass of milk handy!  My husband is the utlimate cookie monster and he raves about these. He tells everyone "My wife makes the BEST Peanut Butter Cookies in the WORLD!" So thanks for making me the cookie queen.  Well, at least in his world!

Absolutely delicious - added some chocolate chips and YUM! They did, however, crumble very easily and are not transportable.

Spectacular! I made these with chocolate chips, and I threw some cocoa powder in the batter, which I recommend in all cookies with chocolate, and they turned out GrEaT!!!

Not very peanut buttery, so only 3 stars. These had OK flavor, but were bland and just didn't have the peanut butter strength of flavor I wanted.

I'm not a huge sweets person or even a baker, this was my first attempt at making cookies from scratch that weren't chocolate chip and I am absolutely in love with this recipe.  I didn't have shortening so I used all butter, they were fantastic, I will be making again and again.  Thank you.

This was a GREAT cookie.  Dough was easy to work with and they baked beautifully.  I did add 1/4 more flour and slightly ground up the oatmeal.  I added a some chocolate chips to half of the dough and those turned out great too!  Thanks for delicious recipe!

Delicious cookies! Everybody in my family loved these, even my mom that doesn't care for peanut butter. I used 1.5 cups of oats and all brown sugar. Make sure to melt the butter for the right texture. Great protein snack for energy.

Wow, these cookies are amazing!!! I added Reese's peanut butter chips to one batch and they were even better than plain! I didn't know these cookies could taste any better. I forgot that I had one cookie sheet with dough left in the fridge so it chilled for maybe half an hour. When I baked them, they were a bit more puffy than the batches I didn't chill. I added M&M's to another batch as well. The aftertaste of the cookie is a bit salty but that's what makes me crave milk! The perfect pairing.

These were great. I agree with other posters, you need to add 1/2 cup extra of oats in order to make them perfect. I also added a little bit of cinnamon to bring out the flavors more.

These cookies have never failed me.  Perfect soft texture and salty-sweet taste every time.  I use butter instead of margarine, and natural peanut butter.  People always ask for the recipe!

These are fantastic!  Baked for 11 min. in my oven, then cooled for 4 min on the sheet or they crumbled. We used real butter instead of margarine & Crunchy Jif peanut butter.  Also, added about a cup of white chocolate chips. They stayed wonderful & soft in an airtight container.

This recipe was easy to make, but too salty. Next time I'll add a a dash of salt instead of the full teaspoon. I did add chocolate chips to mine which gave it a little punch.

Deeeeelicious! I was looking for something rich tasting to go with the horchata I had at home - and this did it! I made a few modifications - I used all butter, and whole wheat flour. Other than that nothing changed and I was rewarded with a chewy center and semi-crunchy ends. You couldn't even taste the whole wheat flour. Woot!

These are really good! I made these because I am trying to get my family to eat more grains. I used raw oatmeal because I don't use instant. The oats add a nice texture and a nutty flavor.I have used the same peanut butter cookie recipe my mom has used for 60+ years. I think I just found one to replce it. Sorry mom!! :D

I followed the recipe as written and while the cookies were soft and chewy with great texture the taste overall was a little off somehow. maybe not enough peanut butter, i don't know. tasted more of the butter/shortening than the peanut butter. I have had better and this is just not what we were looking for. would not make again. I hate that because the overall texture was great.

These are great!  I made them for my husband's work and they loved them.  I added 1 tsp vanilla, omitted the shortening in favor of 1 cup butter, and doubled the oats.  I think these would be great with the addition of more chopped nuts or chocolate chips -- I've gotta try this next time.  These will be in my regular rotation from now on!  Awesome cookies!

These cookies were a big hit with my kids.  They came out perfect, very soft and yummy.  I look forward to trying them next time with chocolate chips.  Also, I did add the extra 1/4 C. of flour and 1/2 C. of oatmeal like suggested.

This recipe is really good exceptionally if you are a peanut butter fan. It isn't so good if you are looking for an oatmeal cookie. I did add some chocolate chips because I was making them for a choco-peanut butter fan. I also only used butter since I didn't have any shortening on hand. They turned out really good. I would make again maybe adding some more oatmeal.

Yummy! These are great! I didn't have shortening, so I left that out. One major adjustment I made is the length of cooking time. I put the first batch in for 10 minutes but they turned out browner and crispier than I prefer. The second batch went in for seven, then six, then the final one went in for five minutes. Five minutes will yield softer cookies which I love. Excellent recipe!

We were all craving something sweet so I went looking for a cookie recipe and found the perfect one in this one!  The only change I made was cutting it in half (only had 1 egg left in the fridge!) and using all margarine since I didn't have any shortening.  It made lots of wonderful cookies-crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. This will be a standard from now on!  I used extra crunchy Jif.

Delicious!  I made them with all butter, natural peanut butter, old-fashioned oats and 1 C chocolate chips.  They came out perfect (not too flat, not too tall) and taste amazing.  This one is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I added chocolate chips after the first tray and they went from good to really good, and then a liberal sprinkle of cinnamon on the remaining dough and they went to a whole new level of awesome.

These are amazing! I used butter in place of the shortening and margarine because I didn't have either, and I did add a touch more flour and oats because the dough was very, very sticky, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. This one is a keeper!

The cookies haven't cooled for more than an hour yet, but these cookies are delicious. I made them for my flat-mates and so far we're loving them! If you're considering this recipe, just do make them.

Yummy and peanut butter-y!  A little too crisp for my taste, I usually like them a bit chewier.  Awesome recipe, though!

This recipe just tasted sort of flat. Texture was nice, but  not enough peanut taste and a little too much salt.  I followed the recipe exactly, but wasn't impressed.

such a hit!  I used a little more oatmeal than listed and added a cup of white chocolate chips.  They turned out fantastic- just be sure to only cook them til the edges are slightly brown and use parchment paper to make it easy to clean up  will make again =)

This recipe was DELISH! I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco, which made them light and crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I also used chunky natural PB.. which was good for texture, and not to salty at all! Also I threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips which were perfect. GREAT RECIPE, thanks for sharing!

The cookies came out delicious.  However, margarine and shortening are full of trans fats which are and very bad for you.  I used 1/2 cup of canola oil, 1/2 cup butter and 1/3 cup flax seeds.

These are good cookies. I think this cookie is a little crumbly. I like them a little moister, but the taste is really good. Next time I will use 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter instead of crisco.

We've made this recipe 5 or 6 times now and everybody loves it. We do use butter instead of shortening/margarine and we added the vanilla and a bit more peanut butter. Just for fun, we split the dough and add heath bar bits to one half. Either way, everybody gobbles them up. We do have a convection oven and I measure out 1/2 teaspon (rounded) and bake for 7 minutes and they come out perfectly soft and a little golden.

I love these -- the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've found to date.  The only change I made was to use 1 stick butter and 1 stick margarine (no shortening) and added one cup of Reese's peanut butter chips.  I'm sure they would've been just as tasty without the chips, though.

Thank you for sharing this great recipe! It was perfect, I did not change a thing :) It was a hit with the kids. When I put the dough on the sheet I used a tablespoon and leveled it off with a butter knife to make a perfect half circle, they were just the right size for my children. Thanks again!!

This is a fantastic recipe! The ingredients are things I always have on hand. I made these with home made peanut butter, which turned out FANTASTIC. Also, I only baked them for about 8 minutes, so underestimate then watch them. Crispy/flaky outside and soft inside. I'll be making these again!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I added another 3/4 cup of oatmeal, and before baking I pressed mine down a bit with the bottom of a glass that had been dipped in sugar.  These cookies have a really unexpected light, crispy texture (maybe that is because I was a bit short on peanut butter) and they taste wonderful.  Everyone in my Mother's Group loved them.

So I decided to bake peanut butter cookies since I noticed this weekend that a package of my Nutter Butters are up to $4.00/package!  This is now what I will bake when I need a peanut butter cookie fix.  And they are better than Nutter Butters!  I added two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and made 3 1/2 dozen cookies. Baked each batch for 12 minutes.  Deliciouso!

This is the only recipe for peanut butter cookies that I have ever liked!  I make the cookies according to the original recipe, but I finish them off by drizzling the cookies with 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 tsp shortening melted, or sometimes I dip half of the cookie in the melted chocolate.  A big fave for everyone!

I was a bit concerned about adjusting this recipe for high altitude (I live at 7200 feet), so the rule of thumb up here is either more liquid or less dry ingredients. So, I reduced the flour to 1 cup and the oatmeal to 3/4 cup. Everything else remained the same. Also, instead of teaspoon-sized drops, I used a pair of rubber gloves and made them into 1-inch size balls and increased cooking time to 20-25 minutes at 350-degrees in a CONVECTION OVEN. This seemed to spread the heat around more evenly.

Instead of 48 cookies, I got 24 three-inch cookies which turned out beautifully! Light and chewy, lots of flavor. 

This is an awesome recipe!

I too thought these were a tad salty. Plus I think the peanut butter over powers the oatmeal. If you like oatmeal cut back on the PB.

Great cookie!  A little salty for my taste, so I would do just a dash salt next time.  I also added twice as many oats for a heartier cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe as is and the whole family LOVED them. It makes a nice big batch but they were still gone in no time. I have a request to make these again since the cookie jar is empty!! Thanks!!

I thought these were okay.  The texture and appearance are great, but the taste leaves a bit to be desired.  They seemed bland and I used over a cup of peanut butter and chopped up peanuts in it too.  Those were the only changes and I still have had much better PB cookies with oats in them.  I agree with the poster that was dissappointed they weren't the "chewy, oatmeal" cookies they desired.

I changed this recipe by using almond butter (allergic to peanuts) instead of peanut butter and added the extra ingredients suggested in another review, 1 3/4 C flour, 1 1/2 C oats to make up for the oil in the almond butter.  It turned out great!.  I have really missed peanut butter cookies since developing my allergy and this is a good substitute.

Excellent cookies!
I found myself without baking soda when I went to make these...so I completely butchered the original recipie...I used 8 teaspoons baking powder, and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cut chopped walnuts, along with 2 teaspoons of vanilla (as recommended by others) and about 1/2 cup extra outmeal. They rose fine, and tasted great! I was worried the baking powder "taste" would come through but not at all!
Slightly crispy outside, chewy and soft inside...
Yumm!

The family sure liked these. Used shortening and stick of butter, no margarine used. Cooked 12 mins. A bit crunchy, will only cook 10 mins next time. They come out floppy, but harden up nicely. Other than the butter substitution, I made no other changes. They ran a bit which produced a thinner cookie than I like, so next time I will add 1/2 cup more oats.

Great recipe.  I froze the dough in cookie size balls and just baked enough for dessert.  They froze beautifully.  I just put the frozen dough in the cold oven and heated it to 350.  It took 13 to 15 min.  Perfect!

I make these cookies all the time, and am always asked for the recipe. I use butter instead of margarine and shortening, and 2 cups oatmeal instead of 1. Cookies are soft and taste SO good.

Pretty darn good! I made these for my husband who is in the Army. They're out in the field where the food has no fiber, so I figured these would help him tough out the miserable rations. I doubled the oats and added a half cup of crushed peanuts, and they're awesome. Held up well in the field as well. These are a winner. :)

I thought these were OK.  Too salty for me and not enough oatmeal.  I will probably make it again with modifications or just try another recipe.

This is a great recipe!  It is a very tender, melt in your mouth texture and the oatmeal adds nicely to the texture without over powering it.  It has a great peanut butter flavor which we love.  I normally use butter in place of margarine but I was out of butter so followed the recipe to a T.  They still tasted great.  I take mine out of the oven when I can tell the bottoms are browning so they do not over-bake.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were amazing cookies! We added chocolate chips and a little vanilla. I found that the chocolate chips took away from the peanut butter flavor. I prefered the ones with barely any chips. Other people mentioned the amount of salt in it. Yes, there is a lot of salt, and it probably could be less, but the salt added to the peanut butter taste and helped the flavors stand out. We will be making this recipe with choco. chips and without in the future.

I love the addition of oatmeal to peanut butter cookies.  It makes them a bit less sweet and a little softer than our normal pb cookie recipe... perfect texture. I will definitely use this again!

Just made these and tried one warm. I really like the texture of the cookies and they're already crisping up on the outside. They also smell and look great. I followed the recipe exactly except added 1 tsp of vanilla as others have suggested and 1 tbsp extra sugar because I used the natural peanut butter with all the oil on top. 
If you're using natural peanut butter, I suggest adding at least 3 or 4 extra tbsp of wh/br sugar and also just more pb. My cookies are good but a bit bland - think they'd be better with good ol JIF or Peter Pan. But I'll definately make em again.

These cookies are so good! The only changes I made was I used 3/4 cup of wheat flour and 3/4 regular flour instead of 1&1/2 cups of the regular. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla also. Thanks Allrecipies and Michele.

This is a good cookie recipe. My little brother hates peanut butter, oatmeal, and chocolate chips (so he says), so when I told him to try one he hesitated and asked if they had peanut butter, but tried one anyways. He liked them alot! And so did the rest of my family of eleven people. And he had no clue that there was oatmeal in them. (He's only 8, so...) 
Don't overbake these by any means! I found that 9 minutes was the most I could cook them or they got too crispy. And with peanut butter chips, or white chips, these would be five star! They are a bit salty, it's true, but I actually like that about them.

I really liked how chewy these were, although mine did turn out flatter then a pancake.  They tasted very good but I wished the peanut butter flavor was a little richer. Update: Made them again and loved every bite!

Made these tasty little goodies for a Memorial Day Weekend BBQ.  Pretty awesome cookies, well received even by my two year old who isn't the easiest little girl to please.  Per other reviews, I added a tsp. of vanilla, and may add one more next time.  I will completely omit the salt from the next batch - I used only 1/2 tsp. in this batch and I still think the salt is too strong.  I like a slightly sweeter cookie.  Other than that, great recipe!  Yum yum yum!

I brought these to a barbeque and after some people had tried these the cookies were gone in only a few minutes! I myself hate peanut butter cookies, but these ones are okay. They have an interesting texture, almost chalky, but not really. When I make them again I'm going to try using all brown sugar. The brown sugar and PB tasted really good together!

Pretty good.  I think it needs more flour and less sugar but I made it as is because there is no point to trying a recipe if you are going to change everything about it.  I added 2 tsp of vanilla after tasting the creamed butter mixture (also used butter, heh).  All in all nice taste.  Ends up being a crispy soft cookie.  Its a good base recipe.

These reminded me of an oatmeal biscuit you can buy here in the UK. I was really impressed with how well they held their shape. They certainly didn't last long in this house. Thankyou Michele.

I rated this tops without really knowing what the recipe is like, but since my substitutions turned out deliciously, I figured the original recipe is just as good.  I like to substitute dry, nonfat plain yogurt for butter to keep the fat down.  In this case, I "messed up" on my measurements, as there is a total of one cup fat (1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup margerine).  I mistakenly put in a total of 2 cups (1 1/2 cup dry yogurt; 1/2 cup canola oil).  I was a little worried, as my error didn't dawn on me until I had the first batch in the oven.  But they turned out really yummy.  Also, I substituted instant apple oatmeal for plain, and that added a nice texture and flavor as well.  Maybe I should post it as a completely new recipe....

These are AWESOME.  The best peanut butter cookie ever!  Followed the recipe exactly except I only had 1/2 cup peanut butter in the house but I had some peanut butter chips so I added them.

These are the best cookies. I did it just like the recipe and my family went crazy over these. I did use the regular cooking oats since I didn't have the quick ones, and they still turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.  
I forgot.. I did use butter instead.

These are yummy. Substituted butter for shortening, white whole wheat for 1/2 cup of the white flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt ( still too salty for my taste...and I LOVE salt) and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

I was looking for something a little "'healthier" for my kids who are peanut butter cookie addicts. Found this recipe and they loved it! My 9 year old, who is extremely picky and won't touch oatmeal cookies with a ten-foot pole, loved them! I did add 1 c. of peanut butter chips, used old fashioned oats and replaced only the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar. I know that I will be making this often. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box.

This is a great recipe!  My husband and I really like these cookies.  I did make a few changes based on reviews from others.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, a 1/2 tsp. of salt, and about a cup and a 1/4 of oatmeal.  I thought these cookies were even better the second day.  I will definitely be making these cookies again!

These cookies are flat-out AWESOME, and hey, they're healthy!  They have oatmeal!  The only modification I did was to add about 2 tsp vanilla.  My church group raved about them and I've been elected the official Thursday-Night Treat Bringer!
Thank you so much!

these were the best cookies we have ever had! Love peanut butter cookies, love oatmeal cookies so what could be better? They are the perfect mix of both! The only thing I changed was all butter (no shortening) and 1/2 C white sugar. My husband could not get enough and unfortunately he ate them all so I am making another batch :)  GREAT and I wouldn't change a thing!

I used butter instead of shortening and just egg whites for the egg. The cookies are big and soft with a chewy texture, definitely not the crumbly, dissolve in your mouth peanut butter cookies that I prefer, but really good nonetheless.

I don't know what I did wrong but these turned out dry, fell apart and burned easily without the entire cookie baking. I followed the recipe exactly...maybe it's my oven. Since everyone raved, its probably a good cookie...but not worth my ingredients, time and calories! disappointed!!

I didn't make any major changes to the recipe.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, and I don't use butter flavored shortening so I used regular shortening and added 1 tsp. butter flavored extract.  I was a little concerned about what the consistency of the batter would be like with so much fat (butter, shortening and peanut butter) and so little flour, but with such high ratings I decided to follow the instructions and see how it turned out.  The batter was pretty soft, so I added roughly an extract 1/2 c. of oats.  The dough worked fine, it didn't spread when baking and I didn't find it necessary to chill before baking.  

I made these today so I can't comment yet on how they taste or if they dry out/harden the following day, but we enjoyed them today.  This recipe makes more of a peanut butter cookie and less of an oatmeal cookie.  I would definitely make these again.

Dry, but it was probably my fault. I subbed some of the sugar for splenda, which always dries things out, and forgot to compensate in the flour. Definitely didn't satisfy my craving. And DON'T OVERCOOK. Cookies were so dry they fell apart in my ziploc bag just sitting on the table.

Fantastic recipe! A really nice texture and flavor. I used all butter, and they turned out great.  I tried half with a peanut butter frosting (just to see what they would be like) and it was really addictive! Thanks for the great addition to my collection!

The uncooked dough was mighty delicious so I was disappointed when the baked cookies were not as good as I had hoped.   I followed the recipe exactly and somewhere between the bowl and the cooling rack they lost some of their peanut buttery-ness.  They also deflated significantly after I took them out of the oven; I even refrigerated the dough to help them keep their shape.  I might try them again with some other reviewers suggestions: perhaps cutting down on the shortening and replacing it with butter or butter-flavored shortening.  I also might sift in a little more flour for density that would help keep them as fluffy as they looked while they were baking.

I made these cookies for my son and his friends at Ft. Gordon.  They loved them!!  I gave a couple to a guy at work who doesn't like peanut butter and he came back  for more.  I will make them again & again.

Fantastic!  They look perfect and taste wonderful.  The only think I added was 1/2 cup ground flax seed to add some good stuff!

Everything that I could have hoped for in a peanut butter cookie.
Bake no more than 10 minutes and let rest on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes when they come out of the oven. 
I can't stop eating them!!

These were quite good, not spectacular.  A little lighter than a normal peanut butter cookie, which is nice.  Thanks!  We will make these again.

Awesome tasting peanut butter cookie.  I used 1 cup butter and they came out nice and soft but a little flat.  I like a nice thick bite of cookie so next time I will add a little more flour and some more peanut butter too to up the peanut buttery goodness.

My Family and I LOVE this cookie!  I made the changes that CARLY suggested... adding: 1TSP VANILLA, INCREASE FLOUR TO 1 3/4 CUP FLOUR...INCREASE OATMEAL TO 1 1/2 CUPS....1 CUP CRUNCHY PEANUT BUTTER PLUS 1/2 CUP CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER .. 1/2 CUP BUTTER AND 1/2 CUP CRISCO BUTTER FLAVOR SHORTENING.... I didn't add the chocolate chips, but did put Hershey Kisses (both plain and caramel filled, ummm) on top.
 BAKE ONLY 10 MINUTES. My changes; I rolled them into balls, then through sugar before baking.  Some cookies I did the "old fashion" cross-fork pattern on top, so it seemed like I had a variety.  We like our cookies flaky/crispy, so I refrigerated for 2 hrs before baking.  These will be the ONLY Peanut Butter Cookie I'll ever use again!

A winner!  I threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips to please my husband, and immediately shared this recipe with my daughters after the first batch came out of the oven. DO NOT OVERBAKE - that is very important to making these cookies their very best.

This was an excellent tasting cookie.  Very easy and quick to make.  I followed the recipe using the shortening & margarine and the cookies spread more than I would have liked so maybe the people who used full butter might have had better luck with that part.  Very delicious and will definitely make again.

This recipe was really good (not great) but good and I am glad I tried it. Next time I would add choc chips for sure. My daughter made a big cookie with some of the batter and she put lots of choc bits in it. It was wonderful. I think the choc bits really made a difference in the cookie for me. I always like to try new recipes so I was glad I came across this one. Thanks for the posting.

Wow, are these good! The oatmeal adds a nice texture, and the flavor is amazing. I used the suggestions from ZJSGRAM and they turned out fabulous. I also folded in half a bag of chocolate/peanut butter chips to the dough; I melted the remaining chips and dipped the edges of the baked & cooled cookies in the melted chocolate, then rolled them in chopped peanuts. My coworkers couldn't stop eating them! Thanks for sharing such a fabulous recipe.

Very good. These remind me of "Monster Cookies" without all the stuff in them. But, I like all the stuff, so I made some plain, (I did add some vanilla and a little extra PB 1/2 C.) and some with choc. and butterscotch chips and some with M&Ms and peanuts. A little something for everybody. I only baked mine for 8 minutes when I saw the bottoms getting golden and they were just right.

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe!  I've never been a fan of peanut butter cookies but thought I'd give these a try because my husband loves them and now I do too!

I did modify the recipe slightly-I cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon, substituted whole wheat flour for white flour, used 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup margarine, increased the oats to 1 1/2 cups, and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and they came out absolutely perfect!

I love the flavor of these cookies, the texture, and how moist they are after being cooked!  The perfect cookie recipe!

Just OK, They lacked any real "body" and ended up flat and mostly fell apart instead of bonding together. Maybe I did something really wrong in the cookie making?  I did slightly alter the recipe by using whole wheat flour, (increased the soda by 1/8 tsp to compensate for the whole wheat also)and added chocolate chips.  After reading some reviews I was really excited to try this "perfect" recipe but I wasn't really WOW-ed. We ate them anyway but next time I'll 1/2 a new recipe so I don't end up with so many mediocre cookies.

Very good recipe, but I agree with alot of the other cooks who say these are too salty.  I could definitely taste the salt.  When I make these again, the salt will be cut in half.  The only thing I did different making these was using all butter, and no shortening, and using all natural peanut butter.  Next time I make these, I believe I'll try more oats to add to the texture.  Other than that, I thought this cookie recipe is one of the best I've had!

OMG...top notch..yummy good! Great texture, rich flavor, and very fattening.
I did add vanilla and about 1/2 cup more oats mixed with wheatgerm (I throw that in everything). I have a feeling I could have added another 1/2 cup oats if I had wanted to. I will make these cookies again very soon and try some white chocolate chips.

These cookies are delicious!  I love the fact that the recipe consists of all my pantry staples.  I did as others suggested & added 1tsp vanilla and an extra 1/2c of oats.  I cooked them for exactly 10min & let them sit for a few before removing from the cookie sheet.  Soooo yummy.  Definitely give these a try!.....P.S. After them cooling & tasting them again the only other thing I would recommended adjusting is the salt to no more than 1/2tsp. I'm not sensitive to salt, but they're just a touch too salty, I think cause the peanut butter is already salty. Other than that, still delicious!

My husband loves peanut butter cookies, so I made a batch of these. They are so delicious and professional looking. I used crunchy peanut butter and a mixture of butterscotch and chocolate chips. I will be making these often. Thanks again for this great recipe!

YUM!  I followed what ZJSGRAM did for the recipe and they were amazing!  Instead of using chocolate chips I used Hershey Kisses.  I unwrapped the kisses beforehand, and let them cool in the fridge.  Once the cookies came out of the oven I immediatedly pressed a kiss into each cookie and let them set.  Make sure you give the chocolate time to settle so don't start stacking the cookies on top of eachother too soon or you'll have a chocolate mess!  I also used a melon scoop for the dough to make them the same size.  Great recipe!

This is a good peanut-butter cookie recipe! I had to tweek it to my families nutritional needs.

Mine is as follws:

 .5 c   margerine
 .5 c   crisco-butter flavor
1   c   brown sugar-packed
 .75c   granulated sugar
1   c   crunchy peanut butter
 .5 c   regular peanut butter
2       eggs
2   tsp imitation vanilla
1.5 c   raisins-softened 
3   tbs raisin liquid

 .75c   unbleached flour
 .75c   whole wheat flour
1.5 tsp baking soda
 .25tsp baking powder
 .5 tsp salt
1.75c   instant oatmeal

1.25c   M&M's

Mix wet ingreidents first, then sift and add dry ingreidents to wet. 

After the dough is mixed, stir in the M&M's. 

Make rounded teaspoon balls and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees. Oven tempetures vary the baking time.  

Let cool 5 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack. 

Store as usual, 48 cookies.

Delicious cookies! The oatmeal makes a nice change of pace from "regular" peanut butter cookies. I used crunchy peanut butter and the cookies were great. Don't overbake or cookies will be very crispy.

I'm not sure if 3 stars is fair, as this is a good cookie... but it's not what I was looking for.  This cookie doesn't have a very strong peanut butter flavor, and it is too cake-like and fluffy for my liking.  I think increasing the amount of peanut butter and oats would improve this recipe.

i followed some of the others and used 1 3/4 cup of flour, 1 1/2 cup oats, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp salt.
they were all good recommendations however overall the cookies didn't come out as i would have hoped. this could have been due to the fact that i only had about 1/3 cup of brown sugar and had to substitute the rest for white. i will try this again in the future with all the right amounts of ingredients.

Great Recipe but i made a few adjustments(also very crumbly but still very good :)Welll lets see, these were my measurements( i doubled the recipe and still only got two dozen good sized cookies) I used 1 cup shortening , 1cup margarine, softened, 2 cups packed brown sugar(it sounds like alot but they really werent all that sweet), 2 cups crunchy peanut butter (i like adams  crunchy peanut butter best), 4 eggs, 3 cups of all purpose flower, 4 teaspoons bakingsoda, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 and a half cups of oatmeal and voila! wonderful( but crumbly) not to sweet oatmel cookies. Although this recipe calls for a lot of peanut buttter u can not really taste it but still very good. next time i think that i will add raisons and cinnamon for the PERFECT flavor. Also this measurement has the perfect amount of oats in it in myopinion and the cookies did not turn out too salty at all! thnx berry much

I thought they were good but they seem to be a little dry, and while I doubled the Peanut Butter they don't have a strong PB taste. Still pretty good though.

These were good, but not amazing.  Maybe I did something wrong, but mine were flat as a pancake until I refrigerated my dough overnight.  Definitely double the oats and watch the baking time.

My family concluded that with suggested changes these cookies were too sugary (although I didn't read that from other reviews I had browsed).  I had added extra oatmeal and, of course, chocolate chips.  They were just ok... if I make them again I may decrease sugar by half.

These cookies are delicious.  The only down side is that they break apart very easily if you remove them from the pan before they've cooled.  Aside from this they are very good.  Next time I may add a little more oatmeal.

Delicious and easy but they were a little salty and I found the cooking time to be about 7 1/2 to 8 min. instead of 10-15.

These are the best cookies ever. My new favorite cookie. They come out so chewy. I used all butter and a heaping amount of peanut butter and a little extra oats as well. I could not stop eating them. I baked them on parchment paper as well. Be sure to take them out at just the right time. My first batch was perfect but my second was left in just a tad bit too long. It was still good but the first batch was chewier.

Changed the recipe for a friend who is on dialysis and on a salt and calorie-restricted diet.  Used 1 c. Crisco butter flavored; reduced salt to 1/2 tsp; added 1 tsp. vanilla flavoring; Used Splenda brown-sugar blend and white sugar blend instead of real sugars; increased oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups.  Came out nice! BTS- used JIF peanut butter - it's just the best peanut butter.

wow these are SOOO good. i followed the adjustments listed by  ZJSGRAM  and they turned out VERY well. 

i also changed half of the flour to whole wheat to make it "healthier" [if any cookie can be deemed healthy] 

i HIGHLY recommend these. they're really quick, too =)

These are good cookies, I wouldn't call them the best, but they are good.  The only thing I did differently was I used margarine instead of shortening. I also added a bag of chocolate chips for my husband's taste. Again, they are good cookies, they are just not what I was hoping they would be.

These were really good cookies.  I added a splash of vanilla and a small bag of chocolate chips.  I'm not much of a sweets eater, but I can't walk past these without grabbing one out of the cookie jar.  Nothing really special, but they sure hit the spot for me!

After reading a few of the reviews I decided to make these.  Well my mixture was also pretty liquidy I added a little more oatmeal, didn't seem to help.  I have to say they baked up real good. My family enjoyed them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These cookies were SOOOO yummy!  The only change I would make would be to omit the salt next time-for some reason they were very salty, but delicious all the same!  Wouldn't these be good w/ butterscoth chips??  Great recipe!

We loved this cookie! The batter was a bit thinner than I wanted it though, and I had no extra oatmeal...just the cup the recipe called for. So I improvised and used about 1/2 cup of my baby's infant oatmeal. They turned out great, my whole family loved them.

These are a good start.  I doubled the oats and used 1.5 cups PB.  I also added a bag of choc/pb mix chips.  I don't normally keep shortening in the house and so had to use butter instead.  Maybe that is why they are very delicate...  If I could get them to be a more hearty, chewy cookie, I would be in heaven!  Will try shortening next time.

These had a wonderful taste, but they were extremely flat. Next time I will add more flour.  I did add 1/4 cup extra peanut butter (which might have been the problem), and doubled the oats. Quite tasty!

These cookies are alright. I only had reduced fat peanut butter crunch and creamy low carb peanut butter and decided to use the low carb butter because it was creamy smooth unlike the reduced fat one. They were just a tad bit dry, but overall the cookies turned out okay. Since I had so much cookie dough left over, I put them in mini cupcake pans and cut pieces of reeses and put them in the middle of the mini muffins.I also put bite size pieces of Twix on the cookies.

Not the best peanut butter cookie, but I did like the addition of oatmeal. Nice texture, but a little gooey.

I brought these cookies along on a camping trip and they were a hit! Everyone LOVED them.  I used others' advice and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  These are one of the best cookies I've ever baked!

Great Recipe! Love it! I used 1 1/2 cups PB, 2 1/2 tsps baking soda, and 2 cups of oats per other reviews. I love peanut butter and chocolate so I added some Nestle Chocolate Chunks, 1 1/2 cups! I like my cookies a little bigger so I used a cookie scoop that I have and it's more like an oversized Tablespoon. I then pressed each round Tablespoon down with a cup so they would stay consistent in thickness. They turned out so good! Going to freeze half of them for school lunches. Thank you for a great recipe!

Great tasting cookies, but my turned out a little flat. It might have been because I used reduced fat peanut butter. Will have to try them again using  regular. But they were still yummy.

These cookies are great! We followed the recipe except for the chocolate chips. We added some nestle mini chocolate chips and it added a great chocolate taste!

After reading all the great reviews, I just had to see for myself and WOW! These cookies truly are amazing!! The  changes I made were I used unsalted butter, 1.5 cups crunchy PB, 1.5 cups oats, 2.5 tsp baking soda, and 2 tsp vanilla (I always like to add a little extra), and 1/4 tsp salt. Thanx Michele for the great recipe!!

YUMMMO!
these are great and still cooling on the rack but half have already been consumed (have to make more now) I did add coarsely chopped dark chocolate to mine (around 1 cup) just because I am a chocaholic :) but it worked and I will DEFINATELY be making this again (when i get more peanut butter, us Aussies dont eat it that often  :) )

These were mouth watering! They are a great alternative to regular peanut butter cookies. They taste just as wonderful, but they save you a lot of time, not having to make little sugar criss cross marks across each one. Recipe is probably the best peanut butter(ish) cookie recipe that I have tried thus far.

Overall the cookies were pretty good, but I would not say the best I have had. A little too salty and had a sandy texture. I think if I make them again I'll use less salt and increase the brown sugar. I also sprinkled some white sugar on the top before baking, I think this helped a little with the taste.

People could not stop eating these!  My boyfriend and his friends went out for the day and while they were gone I baked these little goodies.  When they arrived back home they devoured them complimenting me over and over again.  (talk about an ego boost..ha!)  So I'd say this is a keeper.  One thing though, Next time I will use all shortning instead of the butter to achieve a chewier texture. They cool off to have a crumbly edge and chewy center.

These were very good, but very salty!  Next time I will omit the salt all together... Seems there is already enough in the peanut butter (unless of course you're using salt-free natural peanut butter :)).  I had a few whole pecans left over from Thanksgiving, so I stuck one in the center of each cookie :).

These were awesome! I wanted to add some chocolate to them, so I melted some semi-sweet chips and piped them on top with a piping bag. Much more festive than just adding them to the batter. Took them to work, and they were gone in under an hour!

Absolutly delicious!  The texture is a little grainy, but I think all PB cookies are.  I did as some previous people did: 1 1/2 c peanut butter, 2 1/2 teas baking soda, 1/2 teas salt.  I left the oats at one cup, and added about a cup of choc chips.  I baked on a baking stone for about 15 minutes, and they turned out great!  Thanks Michele!

These were great!  I went with some suggestions left by another user after reading a lot of the reviews: "increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, increased baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp, increased oats to 2 cups and added 1 tsp vanilla."  It was delicious!  Eveyone who tried one couldn't get enough.  Great cookies.  I will definitely make these again.

I also did as others suggested...more peanut butter, baking soda & oats, less salt.  These cookies came out looking nice, but fell a little short on the taste for me.  I like my cookies soft and chewy, these were a little on the dry and "grainy" side.  They weren't the worst cookies I've made, but definitely not the best.

Cookies were easy to make.  I reduced the brown sugar to get a crisper cookie (which was a good idea as the sweetness was just right).  Will definitely use unsalted butter and omit the salt altogether the next time as it turned out too salty.  I added chocolate chips to half the batch and found it tasted much better than those without the chocolate chips.

Amazing!!  I followed a number of  suggestions posted by other reviewers:  increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, increased baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp, increased oats to 2 cups and added 1 tsp vanilla.  These are FABULOUS and my coworkers couldn't get enough! This is definitely a do again recipe!

These cookies were excellent! Everyone who tried them loved them, (even my picky boyfriend!) The only things I changed were I added a tsp of vanilla and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp after reading some of the reviews.

I'm baking and eating these for the first time and wow are these good!
I used crunchy peanut butter, whole wheat flour and stevia(1/2)tsp. in place of the white sugar.
The second batch I put in the freezer before I put them in the oven, but I preferred the looks of the first ones. Will definately make again :)
I'm making these again and didn't use the white sugar,but added 1/2 cup coconut, walnuts and choc. chips. Just as good ;-)

My husband said these are the best cookies I've ever made.  They are definitely very good.  The texture of the oats is very nice.  I made some with and some without chocolate chips and they were all gone by the next day.  Great cookies!  Thanks for this recipe.

When I first made these cookies, and tried them warm, I thought they were way too salty, and wished I had taken other reviewers advice and reduced the salt.  By the next day, they didnt taste salty anymore, they were great... took them to a family reunion where everyone was saying how good they were.  I am undecided yet on what I will do next time, I might try reducing the salt just to see what happens.

If you are looking for a perfect crispy on the outside, moist chewy cookie on the inside...look no further!  The oats give this cookie a wonderful texture.  I added a second cup of oats, a tsp. of vanilla, and an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  I also used all butter instead of shortening and margarine.

My family has never liked peanut butter cookies until this recipe, I did alter it a bit though. I only put 1/2 cup peanut butter and added 1/2 cup Reeses peanut butter chips. I'll only make this recipe if we want peanut butter cookies from now on!!

I followed the recipe almost to a tee.  Added vanilla and doubled the oatmeal.  These turned out alright.  A nice hearty version of a peanut butter cookie.  I disagree with another reviewer about getting a large number of cookies on one pan....mine spread a lot to about 5 inches wide, so make sure you leave enough room for them.

Absolutely a great recipe.  I used butter instead of magarine and added vanilla and these were  very very yummy!  Lots of peanut butter taste and you really can't tell there's oatmeal in them.  It adds such a nice texture.  I've flopped with so many peanut butter cookie recipes.  This is a keeper.

I thought this cookie was too salty--to me it didn't taste like a very flavorful peanut butter cookie.  I liked the texture--but I think from now on I'll stick with plain ole' peanut butter cookies!  Very easy though.

Yummy! I got your recipe from the Allrecipes cookbook and these were the first cookies I made out of the book. Excellant flavor, though I might use a tad less salt next time.  The entire family, plus all the neighbors enjoyed this treat!  I also kept them in a tupperware container and have had no problems with them staying moist the next day! It's a keeper. Thanks!

this recipe was easy & gave me exactly 48 cookies. the only modifications i made were to use old fashioned oats, half whole wheat flour/half all purpose flour & to add 1 tsp. vanilla extract. my cookies were done in 12 minutes. another excellent recipe you may want to try is "peanut butter oatmeal cookies" which is also at this website. thank you michele!

This is a WONDERFUL cookie!  I love the combination of the chewy and crunchy textures.  As per some of the other reviews, I added a tsp of vanilla to the recipe and that was the only variation...absolutely delicious!

WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL! Can't get any easier or tastier! Thanks for a great recipe! I may play with adding some chips or rasins or something to them, but as is, they are GREAT! Oh...and I ran out of quick oats, so I substituted half regular oats...worked just as well.

This cookie is outstanding!  The oats give it a wonderful heartiness (and make it healthier).  I always use chunky peanut butter to add some texture.  The combination of butter with the shortening make it even tastier--that yummy buttery taste.

Really good!  I didn't put the full cup of oats, and added about a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested and they were great!  I was going to use butter, but read the reviews and decided against it and I couln't tell the difference.

These have become another favorite in my cookie recipe collection.  I always double this recipe, and I always add a bag of double-chocolate chips.  I never would've thought of adding oatmeal to a peanut butter cookie; my family REALLY enjoys theses.  Thanks, Michele.

My boyfriend hates pb but after having tried these he quickly decided to change his mind ! Followed the recipe exactly and baked the cookies for 13 minutes. Moist on the inside crunchy on the outside !!! These turn out even in Germany - on the other side of the Atlantic !!! Thanks for a great recipe !!!!!

Of all the kinds of cookies I've ever baked, these are the best!  The oatmeal makes them seem healthier than they actually are, but who cares!  I have made these now a dozen times, and my family never tires of them.

I made two versions of this cookie.  The first is the classic recipe, and the second is with chocolate.  I grated small bits and mixed them in with the final mixture until they were just blended, then I added some more on top when they came out of the oven.  I like the classic version better though.

Very Good. Yes, they were crumbly...at first. But by the next morning they were great. I used all brown sugar, no white, and added chocolate chips. I used Airbake cookie sheets at 325 degrees. I'll make these again.

Yummy!  Just took my fist batch out of the oven!  As other posters, I added some vanilla, a mixture of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips and used butter and crisco (no margerine).  Oh, and used 1 cup Splenda instead of white sugar. Still seems like it's missing "something" though, maybe it's just me.  They are good though.  Don't over cook is right...keep an eye on them or they will be dry and crumbly.  Cant wait for boyfriend to taste them tonight!

I didn't rate this recipe because I didn't follow it by directions.  I only had 1/2 c. of brown sugar so I substituted white sugar for the remaining 1/2 c., and I think that because of this, the cookies were not as sweet as they should have been.  I would still give them 4 stars though with this change.  I also added 1 c. of semi-sweet ch.chips which was a good addition.  My husbands coworkers (a bunch of young, hungry construction workers) ate them all in one day!  They LOVED them!

Followed recipe except used 1 and 1/2 cups of old fashioned oats and 1 tsp of vanilla. As far as peanut butter cookies go, this is the best I have tasted. Usually when I have PB cookies they taste kind of crummy and they fall apart, these held there shape real well. I just rolled into balls and smashed just a bit with a fork before baking. I also added 1/2 cup of raisins. I think next time though, I may add a tsp or so of either cinnamon or nutmeg to kick it up a notch. Seemed to me like it was missing a taste, I think it was probably nutmeg. But other then that EXCELLENT cookies.

This has become a family favorite! I make it with chocolate chips, too. Sometimes I don't have time for cookies so I bake it in a jelly roll pan for great bar cookies. I use real butter and watch not to overbake.

A nice blend of my son's favorite (peanut butter) with mine (oatmeal).  I cut out the salt altogether because there is so much in p.b.  My only complaint would be that the cookies are a little dry.  Softer would have been better.  Still good though.

i was just taking the last sheet out of the oven when my 6 year old grandson walked in.  he wanted to taste a cookie.  he took two bites, his eyes light-up and he told me these cookies were "AWESOME" (he wanted 6 more!) later that night my husband agreeded.  the only thing i did differently was to add 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.

Excellent cookies.  I didn't use any shortening, because I didn't have any on hand.  And I used regular butter instead of margarine.  Yes, it probably has more calories, but the cookies turned out really really really good.  Also, I baked them for exactly 13 minutes.  They are soft and chewy.

I am not a fan of peanut butter cookies but these were good. I used butter and margarine in equal amounts and decreased the white sugar to a 1/2 cup. I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Next time I will add more chocolate chips and vanilla extract.

These are wonderful and very similar to a cookie I've been making for years called PB&O Snackers.  Add 1.5 cups choc chips and 2 tsp cinnamon and tsp vanilla.  Skip the salt if your butter and pnb is salted and only use 1 tsp baking soda.  I use 3 cup oats and 1 cup flour and increase white sugar by 1/4 cup.  A very chewy, satisfying, different cookie!

My husband loves peanut butter cookies but I'm not much of a fan.  These cookies won me over.  They're terrific.  I think I'll use the advice of one of the other reviewers and add chocolate chips next time.

My 4 yr old wanted to make cookies so I chose this one as it is easy. Who would have thunk bakery style cookies were this easy? Maybe I'm in the wrong business!! Anyway, I'll add more PB next time as I love lots of PB. And definitely will add choco chips next time also. But the recipe as is is wonderful. Thanks!

These were good when they came out of the oven but the next day were hard as a rock! Pretty simple ingredients, though. Would probably make again, but not bake as long.

Tried these again and cut back the time... very good. Next time I will add ch. chps.

Really, really good. I used Adam's Chunky Natural style of peanut butter. This made it not too sweet with a bit of crunch. A very nice chewy cookie that everyone loved.

I thought this was a good cookie - as many others stated, soft and chewy on the inside. However, I thought this was a bit too sweet.. definitely something I had to have a glass of milk with. I added about a 1/2 c. chocolate chips to the batter. My husband thought they were EXCELLENT. I'm not sure if I'd like to make this again.. since my husband loved them so much, maybe I will.. and maybe I'll like them more the next time. But again, don't get me wrong, I thought this was very good. Just a little too sweet for my taste.

Delicious!  Great texture - moist and chewy with a nice peanut butter flavor.  I did half the batch as the recipe stated and the other half I experimented by adding chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and raisins and they also turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe makes a nice, chewy cookie. I used low-fat chunky peanut butter and added a few chocolate chips to half of the batch. Next time I will add a tsp. of vanilla, the plain cookie was a little bland. It's a good recipe that i will use again.

These are good if you don't know what kind of cookie to make.  When you add chocolate chips, they have it all.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is they are not chewy & I like chewy cookies.

Overall good recipe. Added 1 cup of chocolate chips as suggested by previous reviews--great idea. Definitely do not want to overcook, they become brittle--9-10 minutes was all we needed in 350 degree convection.

Great cookies!  I switched the margarine for butter and added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Next time I plan to add 1 cup milk chocolate and peanut butter chips mix.

These are excellent cookies.  I don't usually like peanut butter cookies but I love these.  They are not too crunchy like the run of the mill peanut butter cookie but just crunchy enough.  Very tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made a couple of changes, although I'm sure the original is just as good.  I used 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of the margarine and shortening, and added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter. They just melt in your mouth!!  This is definitely a keeper!

These are absolutely the BEST pb cookies EVER!  For anyone tryig this recipe for the first time, I must warn you to allow the cookies to completely cool before taking them off the cookie sheet.  If you don't, they will fall to pieces.  That's just how moist the center is.  ~~YUMMY~~

all the other reviews seem to be raves, but I thought that these cookies tended to be too thin - they fell to pieces quickly. i also had difficulty getting them off the pans quickly enough without them hardening onto the plate. I would prefer a pb cookie with more peanut butter flavor, more thick and chewy, and less oily.

These were great!  I added a half a bag of mini chocolate chips that I had to use up and those were perfect for these cookies.  My husband and my mother loved them, and they are both very picky about cookies.  They were so light and melted in your mouth.  Thanks for the recipe - definetly a keeper.

I made this EXACTLY like the recipe, and I thought it was absolutely great!  I did chill the dough for about 45 minutes before baking, which may help with the spreading some people experienced.

This cookie came out better than I expected. The reason I say this is because I had to convert everthing to metric (since I am in Japan right now). I had to eyeball the baking soda, vanilla, butter, and peanut butter. I think I added more than the recommended amount of peanut butter. I baked the first batch for 8 mintues, but the cookies were too soft. The next batch I baked around 10-11 minutes and they were still soft, but brown on the edges. Overall I thought the cookies came out pretty good.

I added chocolate chips.  We had a house guest and who stuffed his pockets with these.  They lasted less than 24 hours.

They tasted great but I used too much oatmeal so the mix was a little dry and I had to flatten the dough before baking.  I used a bag of choc chips and would use them again.

I really liked these cookies although they are different than regular peanut butter cookies. My husband didn't really like them because he was comparing them to regular peanut butter cookies...he couldn't get past how weird it seemed to have oatmeal in a peanut butter cookie. I also added chocolate chunks which gave them a bit more depth. Good cookie!

These were great cookies, but they do not have as strong of a peanut butter flavor as I was expecting.  I added a few chocolate chips to half of the batch and they turned out wonderfully!

This is SO easy...and these cookies are melt-in-your-mouth!!! I got raves. I added three chocolate chips (semi-sweet) on the top of each cookie just to make it even more interesting. Worked very well. The best thing about this besides how easy it is...it works very well for pwople with arthritis...I have arthritis in my hands and the dough is easy to work with...a great recipe for someone who is handicapped.

This were great! I reduced salt to 1/2 tsp. and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  This dough is very soft so I thought I forgot to measure correctly!  I pat each dough ball on the cookie sheet before baking so each cookie came out perfectly round. A very nice change from heavy peanut butter cookies.

Simply the perfect cookie!  I like to add milk chocolate chips, or even espresso chocolate chips when I can find them.  I've even used mini chips and a tiny scoop to make a basket of mini-bite-sized cookies for a party.  People inhaled them!!

These are wonderful cookies!  The only thing is that they were very flat!  Next time I will add extra flour.  I made half the batch with chocolate chips and those were awesome!  My family devoured these.  I'll definitely be making these again!  Thanks Michele for sharing this great recipe!

I usually love peanut butter cookies, but these seemed quite flavorless and salty; Because of all the other great reviews, I think at some point I will try making them again--things I'll change: reduce the salt, increase the peanut butter.  I just remembered... I also used the recipe scaled to 24 servings; maybe this had something to do with it.

Hard cookies to get right, but these were really good.  I added a little vanilla as well as a little chocolate chips.  I also used all butter flavored crisco instead of the margarine.  They turned out great!

Recently, I've been getting the weirdest peanut butter cookie cravings. Needless to say, I finally gave into them. These cookies are unbelievable. SO delicious, and I love the oatmeal. These are definitely my favorite. Thank you!

These are possibly the best cookies ever!   Much lighter then typical peanut butter and they just melt in your mouth (especially when you dunk them in tea!)  I leave out the salt and add in a tad extra oats.  These are always asked for again!

These are the very best!!!!   The oatmeal makes all the difference.   I made these this morning and hope my husband comes home for lunch so he can have one or two.   Be sure not to overcook!
I used a baller the large one and rolled in sugar
they came out perfectly round.   I have never made such a good cookie

i was looking for a oatmeal cookie with peanut butter and when i found this one it sounded perfect.  it nearly was, although my cookies turned out a little on the flat side, they were still moist, chewey and the perfect combination of oatmeal and peanut butter.  they were a big hit with everyone, although i just prefer my cookies a little plumper.  flavor was fabulous!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful.  I've made them twice now.  They are soft and chewy, just the way we like them.  I like to use old-fashioned oats for the texture.  I also added 6 oz. milk chocolate chips and they're great.  Everyone that has eaten them raves about them.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were good, I made them with crunhy peanut butter, and I think they would have been better with creamy peanut butter and some peanut butter chips. They are soft and chewy, and the oatmeal is great...

I like your recipe, it was relatively easy to make. It took me longer than usual(because the baby wanted to see what was going on up there)The taste is moist and delicious, and gets a 5 star kid rating(which means it probably passes with the dads too) we added chocolate chips for a variation and used 1 cup margarine as opposed to   1/2cup. shortening because we were short of it.

Although other reviews indicated this was a bit salty, I didn't find it to be any more salty than other peanut butter cookies.  My kids, especially my college-aged son loved these.  I did add chocolate chips.

I added a little vanilla extract to these great cookies. In response to the comment about these cookies "being too salty", maybe you used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose?

Great cookies!  I used 1 cup of butter and about half the salt and they turned out very tasty.  I don't think they are bland at all.  My husband, who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, really likes them, too.  Thanks!

good, crispy outside, chewy inside. Spreads nicely and not too much. I used measuring tablespoon. I used shortning and butter. I used bread flour. I put 1/2 cup more oats. I threw in a few choc chips. I baked 10 min on a convection oven.

I added chocolate chips and a few chopped dry roasted peanuts.  I cooked just two dozen and froze the rest of the dough so I could bake just a few at a time.  My boyfriend just loved them.  He hadn't had homemade peanut butter cookies in 42 years!!  Will definetly make them again.

These were pretty good peanut butter cookies, but nothing too special.  The cookies were rather flat and had an average taste.  Overall they weren't bad, but I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

This is one of the best peanut butter recipes I have ever tasted. I added more peanuts and they were a hit. Next time I will need to double the recipe and try adding some chocolate chips for special treat.

These cookies were SOOOOOOOOOOO good!  I had friends over the night I made them and everyone who ate the cookies just loved them.  I added chocolate chips and baked for 12 min.  This recipe made a LOT of cookies too so I had plenty for all to enjoy.

MMM...these are wonderful!  I doubled the recipe the first time I made them.  Next time I'll triple it!  These freeze wonderfully (and are great for late night cravings).  I'll try it with crunchy peanut butter as well.  I baked these 11-12 minutes, which was perfect.  (I think 15 min. would be way too much).  Thanks for this one - it's definetly a "keeper"!

Hey Michele! I read some of the reviews on your cookies today and just had to try the recipe!  My three yr. old and I mixed them up together (which was quite an experience) and ended up with more than 4 dozen cookies...which was good since the whole family ate them like there was no tomorrow!  Hubby said they reminded him of pb cookies his G'Ma used to make for him!  BRAVO! =)

These are the BEST peanut butter cookies my family has ever had the pleasure of trying!!!  I have a very picky family when it comes to baked goods, but these were a HUGE hit and didn't even make it to the cookie jar.  Thanks so much for sharing!  I look high and low for special recipes and this one is #1.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  Like a few others I added chocolate chips to about half the batter and it was pretty good too, but I think they are better just the way the recipe tells you to make them.  Thanks Michele!!

Really tasty cooking - I used half mix, and it was a bit sloppy the first time, so for the 2nd batch I used a full cup of flour instead of 3/4, and threw in about 1/2 cup of choc chips, and they were wonderful- great recipe!

This cookie is absolutely delicious!  I used butter instead of margarine and added chocolate chips.  It's great as an ice cream cookie sandwich!  I might add more oats next time.
