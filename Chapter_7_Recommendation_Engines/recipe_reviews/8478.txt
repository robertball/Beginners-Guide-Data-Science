Only one problem.  Vanilla extract amount is left out.  Researched another recipe and found 2tsp is normal.  Might want to add that to the recipe

Loved this frosting. Good on cakes, cupcakes, but especially pumpkin bread. Nice for those that love nuts on their sweets.

This was very creamy!  I halved the recipe and used it on pumpkin cake III. I only used 1/4 cup of  minced walnuts (kids not a fan of nuts in their desserts) and a small amount of almond extract (didn't have vanilla).

I did not have enough confectioner's sugar, so I replaced 1 cup with light brown sugar, added a tablespoon of peanut butter, a tablespoon of milk, 1/2 cup of coconut and some yellow food coloring.  I frosted a banana cake with this recipe and it turned out yummy!

This is the best Cream Cheese frosting I have found yet!  Everyone loves this.  I only use the nuts occasionally, depending on what I am making, but I usually just make according to directions and omit the nuts.  It's perfect!

I doubled this recipe the other day, and used it on a 9" round carrot cake. It was FANTASTIC!!!  When the frosting is doubled, you have the perfect amount for an amply frosted 2-layer cake, with even a little left over to enjoy yourself! ;)

Used this as a filling for a red velvet cake that I wrapped with white chocolate plastic for an engagement cake. It was wonderful.

The only change I would do for the next time I make the icing is cut back on the powder sugar, but other than that the icing was super yummy .
