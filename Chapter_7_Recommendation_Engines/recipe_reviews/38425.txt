This is a GREAT recipe, delicious flavors.  It makes a ton of dip.  It's not really a dip, but more of a layered "torte" of cheese, pesto, sundried tomatoes, etc.  I made it for a Christmas gathering, and even with 15 guests, I still had quite a bit left over.  I would suggest lining your serving plate with basil leaves so that they peek out from under the dip.  Great presentation!  Make sure to serve with crackers that are not salty.  A toasted Italian bread or a sturdy water cracker works well.

This was very good and enjoyed by our guests.  The only changes I made in the preparation was that I put the sundried tomatoes in the food processor.  I do not care for them in chunks and it really spread more easily.  I also put this in a small 4" springform pan.  I did line it with plastic and it was so easy to present and looked beautiful.  I was asked for the recipe and I will certainly make it again....oh, I used vodka too.

Absolutely the best dip ever! I made it for a holiday party this past weekend - everyone loved it AND many asked me for the recipe~! I did make a few changes based on other reviews.
First off I made my own pesto sauce from this recipe off the site: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Pesto-Sauce/Detail.aspx - I halved the amount, used pine nuts and didn't add much salt which I think is really what made the dip as a whole good because I think store bought pesto is much saltier and the dip is already very flavorful on its own.  For the dip, I also halved the recipe, still made a lot good for 15-20 people.  Used a creamy feta, fresh cream cheese from a cheese market.  Used about 1 1/4 cup of sun dried tomatoes in jar in oil - but made sure to drain as much oil as possible. Used all the pesto which was about 1 1/2 cup, again try to leave out oily parts. I added more tomatoes and pesto because other reviews stated there was too much cheese mixture, and it's true.  So I just made the dip as I wanted and added more of the other layers.  Best served with whole wheat pita or baguettes and make sure you place them on a separate plate because the dip will still be a bit oily on the bottom.  WONDERFUL DIP!!

This spread is delicious and unique.  It truly is much more colorful than this photo depicts. Couple of tips...I've gotten the best reviews when I serve the spread with slices of baguette bread.  The flavor is simply too overwhelming for a cracker in my opinion.  The bread slice stands up to the texture and flavors quite nicely and it makes the perfect two-bite appetizer.  This recipe goes a LONG way as it's quite rich.  I agree with those who say leave the butter in.  The texture would change too much without it.  I have found, however, that I need to soak up some of the oil that leeches out of the spread from the pesto and sundried tomatoes.  It looks nicer if you clean it up a bit once it's set.  You won't have to worry how it looks for long, however, because it will be GONE!  Great recipe.

I used my large mixer with a wire beater instead of my tiny processor. This recipe makes a large amount that my processor cannot accomodate. Came out wonderfully. Next time I'll double the amount of tomatoes and nuts and increase the pesto to 1 c. since there is so much cheese mixture. Let it come to room temperature before eating, otherwise it will be crumbly. This is a wonderful recipe for entertaining.

This dip is raved over everytime.  I served it at a dinner party and between 8 people the entire recipe was gone (that is a LOT of dip!).  I've been asked to make it several times since.  What is especially impressive is that since things are whipped together in the food processor, all of the flavors melt together beautifully, and no one knows what makes them love it so much!  If I paid top dollar for this at a restaurant I would not be disappointed.

Excellent!  I am eating it as I write (and my husband is wrapping presents in the garage!)  I would do three things differently next time. 1) Pulverize the sun-dried tomotoes in the food processor into smaller pieces. 2) Drain and mop up as much oil from both the pesto and sun-dried tomatoes as possible. 3) Split it in two. You could easily make this is two smaller molds and freeze one for later. It is very good!

My sister made this for a party and people could not stop talking about how delicious this "dip" was.  (It's actually more like a spread for crackers.) She halved the recipe for the amount of people attending and it was more than sufficient.  The presentation is spectacular, not to mention how wonderful the ingredients taste together.  Simply outstanding!

Everyone raves about this dip everytime I make it!  I made it for the first time last year and I've been begged to make it to each gathering since!

It is already perfect but there are a couple things that I do that I think make it even better...

I buy the sundried tomato that comes in a jar with olive so I drain it and I use the food processor to make it more of a sundried tomato paste layer.  It's easier to eat and it tastes really good to people like my husband that aren't fans of sundried tomatoes.

I always drain the pesto so it isn't so oily.

I use extra pine nuts... people love the pine nuts and the first time I made it I felt there wasn't enough!

I usually only do the layers once each instead of repeating it.

I love to use shaped dishes so that it comes out looking really nice once you turn it over.

I always use vodka.

The best crackers to use are plain good crackers... crackers with any flavor is not the best choice because then there's too much going on.

This was pretty good, but not great. A good combination of ingredients, but perhaps in the wrong proportions. Chopping all those sundried tomatoes was too much work for the outcome. The garlic overpowered the feta. I'm a big garlic fan, but one small clove would have been more than plenty. The oil in the pesto I used had separated, and I made the mistake of stirring it back in before using it. I should have drained  off the oil instead. The oil kind of drained down and sat there on the plate after the dip had come up to room temperature. I don't think I'll make this again.

This was a great recipe.  I was a little nervous because I never made anything like this before but everyone loved it.  I took it to a Night at the Races event and even people from the next table wanted the recipe.  I gave them the name of the recipe and the adress to this great web site. I will definately make it again. It looks like it took a lot of time but it really didn't.  Thanks Dana for sharing this great recipe!

This is just wonderful!  The photo doesn't look at all like what it looks like--gorgeous red tomatoes atop layers of white, green and red.  So great for Christmas!  This is very rich.  I didn't think that it would make a lot, but it really goes a long way.  Will make again at the Holidays.

Excellent and pretty - and makes a huge amount. I made my own pesto - with enough garlic to maim, so I only used one 'stripe' of it and subbed the 2nd stripe with chopped olives. I also think the feta is a bit much and would probably stick to cream cheese next time. I'm taking this to a medium-size party, so I formed it in a medium rectangular tupperware (using the oil and plastic trick) and kept the rest for me. Served with black pepper Triscuits and Ritz. Thanks!! :)

This gets only 4 stars because it is VERY time consuming and expensive to make and requires a pretty mature palate.  I and several guests liked the fairly sharp flavor, but others thought too much pesto and just weren't crazy about it.  Hence, I have a lot left, even after taking it to a party with @20 people -- 1/2 recipe would have been plenty!  RECS: 1)chop the toms with scissors -- takes forever but easiest way; 2)better served with bread than crackers; 3)consider the audience you're serving this to; 4)a little goes a long way because it's a pretty intense flavor; 5)remove oil from toms and everywhere else possible.

This makes a fabulous presentation!  I pressed the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and the pesto, and it held together well, even after coming to room temperature on the buffet table.  Lots of folks commented on the presentation and the flavors, too!  I served it with simple water crackers so the spread would be the star.  Thanks for the idea--very creative!

This recipe is fabulous!  A couple of helpful notes:  It took me much longer than 20 minutes to put together, and this is definitely something you serve for a special occasion, so give yourself plenty of time to prepare it.  Also, I let mine refrigerate overnight.  I prepared it in a round jello mold, put it on a silver platter and covered it with a cake dome, then brought it to a friend's house for a party.  It was a huge success!  Can easily be cut in half for smaller groups, too!  Oo la la!

Fabulous.  And perfect as written.  Even the rednecks in the family love it.  For my daughter's beach wedding, I made a couple of these 2 week in advance and froze them to carry down.  They were still excellent.

Everyone wanted the recipe for this when I made it! It is sooo delicious. I didn't want to give out the "secret" ingredient (butter)! I also didn't have vermouth, so used balsamic vinegar instead which also gave it a nice color and flavor.

I halved this recipe and it was perfect! I did use less feta and butter, do drain the oil from the pesto before adding or it will separate when at room temp. I also only added the toasted pine nuts to the top and smushed to the outside of the dip, otherwise they can get soft, and I like them firm. This is sooo good!

Followed recipe exactly and everyone loved it however, I think this dip needs to be served at room temperature. For some reason it was much better that way.

i was a little doubtful at first... the alcohol and garlic made it almost too pungent for taste... but i assembled it and let it sit overnight- and it tasted great at an Easter brunch!  next time, i might sautee the garlic and shallots in olive oil first- to mellow out the stinkiness...  otherwise, i was pleased.  also you can easily half the butter.  its not needed.

I made this for a small dinner party.  Decided to make 10 servings - 1/3 recipe) which was just about the right amount to fit in my 4"x1.75" springform pan (I had about 2T. of cheese mixture extra).  I toasted the pine nuts in the oven @375 for about 6 minutes, shaking the pan every minute.  And I used very good quality julienne sundried tomatoes that I further chopped with a kitchen shear.  I used homemade pesto (Basil Pecan Pesto from AllRecipes).  I lined the pan with plastic wrap and I did also grease the an although I did not understand why the directions included grease underneath the lining.  The "dip" unmolded perfectly.  Next time I will make an extra effort to be sure that each layer is heavy along the edge of the pan/mold because that would make a prettier presentation.  I recommend using the finest ingredients for the best taste in this recipe.  This is not an inexpensive food.  I made it for a dinner party and as a trial run for Christmas.  Definitely a special occasion recipe.  Thank you DANA for sharing. :)

I served this at a Thanksgiving get-together at our home, and it was much enjoyed.  My daughter asked for the recipe.  I used almonds instead of pine nuts, which I thought worked well.  I really don't like pine nuts much.  But the almonds were crunchy and the flavor blended well.  It does make quite a large amount, and even with 10 people, much was left over.  Sent it home with one of the guests who was happy to have it.  The appearance was beautiful, and it was quite easy to do.  I put fresh basil leaves around the base of the dip on a raised platter, placed that on another plate, and then arranged baguette slices underneath on the lower plate.  Will keep this recipe for a repeat performance.

If you want to impress your guests, then try this recipe.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  It is definately more of a spread than a dip.  I served it with panetini (little Italian toasts) with the little spreaders/knives and it makes a very nice presentation.  I also omitted the vermouth and did not miss it at all.  You could easily just make the spread part with  the feta, butter, cream cheese and seasonings for a super easy and quick dip.

SO GOOD! I halved the recipe as it makes a very large serving. Used extra moist sun dried tomatoes without oil and ground them up in the food processor. As per other suggestions, drained oil off of pesto as much as possible and once the dip was set, I used papertowel to get some of that additional oil off. Served on a baguette and it got rave reviews from everyone. Thanks so much!

This was fantastic!  I used Vodka instead of Vermouth and it turned out great - I got rave reviews.  I made the entire batch for a party of about 20, it turned out to be too much.  Half would've been perfect.  Great recipe!

You must try it to believe it.  I guarantee that this recipe is something new, not the same old dips that you have seen a million times.  When you begin to assemble this dip you will think it will never hold together, but after chilled, it does.   The first time I made this recipe I made my own pesto.  From then on I purchased pesto from one of the local warehouse grocers.  This made this recipe much easier.  Also, I suggest that you get the sun-dried tomatoes that are already cut.  Then just a slight chop will do the trick.  I also used feta, packed in brine, from my specialty grocer. It’s fresher and creamier.  Please don’t let the photo shown here deter you from trying this recipe.  When it is turned out it is beautiful.  I served it with the mini-pitas that I cut in half.  Everyone enjoyed stuffing the little pita halves full with this WONDERFUL dip.  Thanks Dana Cole, this is a winner.

This was ok but how in the world do you find sunripened tomatoed that are soft enough to "dip"  I bought the kind in oil and my food processor could hardly get them chopped.  I ended up using roasted red peppers and just a few tomatoes.  Is ther a certain kind that other people have had success with??  Also I would skip the cloves of garlic all together there is enough in the pesto.

Wonderful recipe.  I disagree with those who would leave the butter out.  It gives the dip such a rich smooth texture - the feta is a little grainy and the butter seems to lessen that somewhat. The butter also makes this dip literally melt in your mouth. I followed this recipe to the letter except that I didn't have any shallots so I just omitted them & added a little onion salt.  It does have a very strong and pungent cheese flavor so if you don't like feta cheese, you probably wouldn't like this dip.  I serve with whole wheat cracker or garlic bagel chips...heavenly!!

This was really good. I made it for a party, and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used only half the butter that it called for and a little extra cream cheese. I also skipped the pine nuts because I don't really care for them and used gin instead of vermouth because that's what I had. I didn't think that this was as expensive or time consuming as some of the other reviewers. Granted, it costs more than chips and dip, but the result is worth it. If you're really worried about cost, the recipe could easily be halved and just made in a smaller mold. One suggestion--if you buy sundried tomatoes packed in oil, rinse them before chopping. I rinsed mine but not very well, and the final dip was a little oily. I blotted it with paper towels before serving.

This dip is good, but it's really, really rich. It also makes quite a bit so if you're not serving a small army I would suggest scaling down. That being said it's really good! I used almonds instead of pine nuts since they were already in the pesto.

I loved this recipe and wll make it again and again. I halved the butter/feta cheese/CC mixture but ended up using the whole 8oz of CC because it was too salty ( i used salted butter). The pine nuts I toasted in a pan. I chopped the sin dried tomatoes and tried to remove as much of the oil as possible. I used vodka instead of the vermouth. Also - I didn't measure the pesto, nuts or tomatoes. Next time I will try to use a less oily pesto. I served this with assorted crackers. Thanks so much for the recipe. This one is a keeper.

I made this for a work potluck today.  It was mostly gone by the end of the potluck; I put the rest in the kitchen and it was gone by the end of the day.  Everyone loved it and I came home with an empty plate.  Perfect.  A few people asked for the recipe.  I did make a few changes--didn't have time to crush garlic and I didn't have shallots, so I subbed 1/8 tspn garlic powder and 1/4 tspn onion powder. I made it in a bundt pan and use oiled press and seal wrap.  Perfect.  Thanks!

Followed this recipe exactly and it was outstanding.  That being said, I do have a few comments about what I would do differently the next time I make it, and there WILL be a next time.  As others stated, this does make a huge amount.  I too split it in half so I could take it to two functions.  While there is certainly enough of the cheese/butter mixture to do this, I found that I used the entire amount of sundried tomatoes, pine nuts and pesto on one portion.  So I doubled the amount of those items to split the recipe in half.  Also, if you are thinking it's going to look like the featured photo, it isn't.  (It still makes a nice presentation, however.)  Firstly, sundried tomatoes are not bright red.  Secondly, there is no way I was able to "spread the pesto over the pine nuts without it all getting mixed up.  Again, did not affect the taste at all.  Feta cheese is salty on it's own, so make sure you do use the unsalted butter.  I drained my pesto of some of the oil, and used dried tomatoes (not the ones packed in oil) so that it wasn't so oily per the recommendation of other commenters.  I used a 6" round cake pan lined with plastic wrap and it was a great size and came out of the pan beautifully.  Let this come to room temp before serving or it will crumble instead of spread.  It went over very well at both funtions I took it to, and I came home with empty plates! :)

Have made this for a couple of occasions, and it's always a HUGE hit.  For the holidays, I made it up in  taco baker (to make soft tacos into bowls) so it ended up with that lovely star shape.  Outstanding look for the holiday ... very much in keeping with the festive season!

I made this dip for a holiday party and it was a huge hit! Everyone wanted the recipe.  I used light cream cheese, light feta and only 1 stick of butter (it calls for 2 but completely unnecessary).  I can't imagine that 2nd stick of butter making it taste any better. It was so flavorful!  The extra fat and calories was not at all missed!

Pine nuts are $50 per pound and I can't afford them.  I decided to just make the base of this dip and add fresh thyme.  It's heavenly on toast, crackers and on sandwiches.

I really liked this as a spread. It was a nice combo of salty and creamy. I made too much and had lots left over so I threw it in a pan, melted it, added a little cream and a ladle full of pasta cooking water, and bam- the MOST DELICIOUS sauce for pasta. I highly recommend holding half back to make an easy pasta sauce later in the week.

This is absolutely delicious and so tasty and light to eat. Definitely use toasted baguettes for the cracker as you don't want to take away from the flavor of the dip. It looks very impressive and can be made a head of time. I did add black olivesand garlic and made it in two small containers as it was very hot out this weekend and I didn't want it to sit out too long in extremely warm weather. It was a hit at the party, will definitely make again and again as it is so pretty on the table! Thanks so much for sharing!

My cousin made this for a baby shower we recently hosted.  It was fabulous, definitely the best item on the buffet.  I believe the only substitution was vodka for vermouth.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Awesome dip for crackers! I get asked to make this one for all the parties we go to. I leave out the dry vermouth, but keep everything else as is. Like others said it makes alot of dip so I usually end up halfing the recipe for smaller parties. I just use a large round ziploc container and line it with saran wrap - no need to oil it as it slides out easily.

This is decadent.  Made this for a party and everyone loved it.  The complimenting layers of creamy cheese, tangy tomatoes, crunchy pine nuts and rich pesto are a brillaint match, and made a beautiful dish.  People couldn't stop eating it.

Sorry!  We tried to like it but it just didn't look very appetizing so the football partygoers passed it by for the most part.  It was awfully salty, too.

Excellent dip! It was a big hit at a tailgate party.  I did drain and wash the sundried tomatoes, so the oil leaking out was not a problem at all.  For a small gathering half would be plenty.

This was well received at a party. However, it was very oily.  Lots of oil pooled on the plate by parties end, didnt look very appealing.  But it tasted good.  I followed advice and sauteed the garlic/shallots a bit.  I also did not add the oil back in from the pesto and thoroughly drained and patted dry the tomatoes.

This recipe has been the hit of every party I've made it for. It makes a lot of dip, so I played added more sundried tomatoes, pesto, and pine nuts to allow for more layers to the dip. Very pretty when finished. be sure to bring copies of this recipe for everyone that will be asking for it!

This dip/spread is amazing!  It definitely deserves all the accolades it has been receiving.  I went the way many other reviewers did and used sun dried tomato spread.  After reading that the recipe made a lot, I decided to make it into two separate molds so I could take it to two different parties over the holidays.  It was a hit at both and gobbled up in no time.

I made this recently and everyone really enjoyed it, even though I neglected to toast the pine nuts. What I wasn't sure about was whether to use the bagged or jarred sun dried tomatoes, so I went with the jarred. I like the idea one reviewer posted about processing the tomatoes. I'll give that a shot. Planning to make this again for Thanksgiving!

this is really good. I cut the recipe down to 8 and used it as part of a buffet. I used red pesto because I didn't have green and will not do that the next time that I make this.The color contrast is better with green. Easy to make delicious and light.

I don't understand what went wrong with this.  I triple checked the recipe and I don't think I made a mistake.  It looked beautiful, and the ingredients seem like they would work so well together.  No one ate it.  I wasn't that thrilled with it either.  I used almonds instead of pine nuts (cost).  Maybe it was the feta, it was a very strong feta and I normally love feta, but I don't think I liked it in this.  Not sure if that is the problem though.  I molded it in a standard loaf pan and that fit the recipe perfectly.

This was very good!  I substituted finely diced onion and white wine which was what I had on hand.  It came out a little crumbly but still looked pretty and tasted great.

I use a Rubbermaid "Take Along" round #3 container for half of this recipe.  I love the presentation of it in that shape.  I use that every time and I think it looks great!  I LOVE this recipe and have made it for MANY events.  It always gets devoured.

This was a beautiful presentation, but only the adults cared for it. I took it to a family gathering with 18 people, 8 of which were adults, and came home with most of it. I wish I could say we loved it after all the reviews, but unfortunately, we didn't. Thanks for the post!

Thank goodness for everyday home cooks to have the creativity & spirit to play with recipes! This recipe has a great start, but I've made this a few times and made the following changes:
use a bundt pan (to get a holiday wreath shape & do go 2 layers - it's gorgeous!)  Use half feta & half gorgonzola (or find a milder cheese to your liking), definitely do NOT use a shallot - too strong. Replace it by 1/2 amount of onion. Enjoy!!

This is a beautiful, delicious, festive dip! Everyone at my party loved it!! It is easy to make if you have a food processor.  I made these adjustments, based on what I had in the kitchen: 12 oz cream cheese (light); 5 oz feta (light), green onions instead of shallot; black pepper instead of white; homemade pesto (to control the oil); and white balsamic vinegar instead of vermouth. Perfect!!!

I made this for a holiday party last night and it was easily the most popular thing there. Delicious! I didn't change any ingredients, but I didn't bother molding and chilling it. I spread it in a pie plate with the cheese on the bottom, then the pesto, then the tomatoes. Also, the recipe says sun-dried tomatoes, NOT tomatoes in oil, so if you use tomatoes packed in oil, it's gonna be oily!

The presentation is amazing and the taste is very good.  I got lots of complements on this dip.  I used sundried tomatoes that were packed dry in a bag and I used homemade pesto and I did not have any issues with excess oil.  I also used 16 oz of cream cheese and 4 oz of feta cheese as I was concerned that it would not have mass appeal otherwise ... it had very mainstream flavors this way.  I would add more pine nuts next time, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  I will make this again!

This was really awesome recipe!  I served at a cocktail party and it was a hit.  I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount.  I will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

Amazing! I get rave reviews. Dry out the pesto and sundried tomatoes as much as you can b/c it's very oily. Half this recipe if you're having anywhere from 2 to 8 people otherwise it's a monster dip (and very expensive to make). But a huge hit!!!

I've made this few of times now and it's always been a hit. It's a staple now at my holiday parties.  Wonderful served with baked pita chips, celery sticks, and carrot sticks.

Every time I make this I get compliments!  I never have vermouth on hand so I just subsitute it with vodka (stoli) and it still works great.  I drain the tomatoes and pesto REALLY well before layering it all together.  And I agree with another member that it tastes better served on bread than crackers.  One time I used a tiny bit of gorgonzola in place the of feta which was really good too.

Good and easy.  I dried the tomatoes as suggested.  The oil from the pesto collected on the plate, but nobody seemed to mind - they loved the dip.  Just don't put your crackers on the same plate unless you want them soaking in oil.

I was kind of grossed out by the 1 stick of butter, so I used less of it and it was fine.  This would be really good spread on bagel chips.  Overall, it was pretty yummy!

This was a big hit at a party.  I did think that I used a little too much sun-dried tomato because it kind of overpowered the butter, cheese mixture (which is my favorite part!)  It is pretty garlicky which is fine by me because I love garlic but some did comment on the garlic.  I made this the morning of the party and let it sit in the fridge all day and it came out of the pan beautifully.  I used a bundt pan instead of a jello mold and it worked out fine.  I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray, placed plastic wrap in the pan and layered the dip.  It was easy.

Very Good! I am giving it 4 stars because of the cost involved in making it. Otherwise, everyone loved it and  several people asked for the recipe. I did make a few changes. I did not use vermouth because I didn't have any. I forgot to buy pinenuts, so I used chopped pecans. I also added extra garlic which made it very garlicky-spicy, but everyone seemed to love it anyway. I also used some sweet onion in place of the shallot. I wasn't sure about the sun-dried tomatoes. I used the ones that had been soaked in oil. I drained the oil first. All in all and delicious and pretty dip!

This dip was a huge success both times I made it.  Both the presentation and taste were fabulous!  I used red wine vinegar instead of vermouth and added a little extra pesto and sun-dried tomatoes, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I made this for a party this past weekend and it was barely touched. I tasted what was left, trying to decide whether to toss or keep, and it tasted WAY too strongly of garlic. Barely any of it was eaten.

Made this with vodka as well.  It was a GREAT appetizer.  It got rave reviews (I was starting to get embarrassed by the amount of compliments!!!) at a recent party I took it to and it looks so fabulous on a platter surrounded by crackers and toasties to spread it on.  I will definately make this again.

Really good, everyone loved it and it looked awesome. Made it in loaf pan. I did make changes based on personal preferences. Used 1 cup unsalted butter ( organic) and 8 oz soft goat cheese and 8 oz cream cheese. No alcohol, no garlic or shallot. The 2 layers were green pesto and sundried tomatoes that were run through food processor. I added 2 oz of cream cheese to the green pesto and also to the sundried tomatoes. I used sundried tomatoes that were packed in oil but I drained and wiped them. I also drained off the oil from the green pesto. No oily residue on tray. I did layers differently; I started with cheese mix and then alternated green pesto, cheese, red pesto, cheese, etc ending with cheese. After I unmolded it I pressed pignoli nuts onto top. Served with sliced baguette and crackers. Seemed like baguette was most popular.

I'm giving this five stars since my guests loved it. I personally do not like feta cheese so I only tried a little on Italian toast. Loved the consistency. I used a small glass bowl and it set up perfectly. Should have taken a picture. And yes, even though I drained the tomatoes and basil, it does ooze a bit of oil. A put a paper doily on the plate and it definitely needs that.

This would be better without the garlic and shallots.  Or maybe just half the amount.   It's too strong as it's not cooked.  Otherwise, this was very tasty and pretty too!

I love this and it's always a hit. I cut the butter in half and use 8 oz block of feta. I blanche the garlic or it has too much bite. Be sure to drain the pesto and sun dried tomatoes. Pine nuts are expensive so I've never used but I'm sure they're nice.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried. I coursely chop the pine nuts and use 4 mini loaf pans as forms because it makes so much. Otherwise its perfect. I will be using this one forever!

I used low fat goat cheese (instead of the butter) and low fat feta and cream cheese. Instead of pine nuts I used slivered almonds. Rum was my choice of liquour.  Fresh chives instead of shallot and added a few hot pepper flakes. Huge hit ! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was easy enough and very tasty.  I like it best on pita chips, but toasted baguette slices are really good, too.  I gave it only 4 stars because it does turn out greasy, if you are not careful, and I found it to be a little expensive considering the results.

Delicious! But not on the first day. I made this a few hours before a party and the flavours had not melded. Luckily we had tons of food so I left it in the fridge. The next day it was better, but today--three days later--it's absolutely delicious. The flavours have blended together, and the initial sharpness of the alcohol and garlic are milder, but still add depth to the flavour.
Here are my mods: used vodka instead of vermouth, used one 160g pack each of pre-made Olivieri Sundried Tomato Pesto and Olivieri Basil Pesto, both strained prior to layering.
When prepping, I thought the non-cheese layers would be too thin, but both pesto and sundried tomatoes are strong flavours, so they all balance together. I layered it in a 1.75Qt/1.66L Pyrex with non-stick spray, and lined with saran wrap.

Gorgeous presentation and super yummy. This was a huge hit @ our Christmas Party and so festive. It makes a large amount. 20 guests devoured it and we had quite a bit left over. Would try and halve the recipe next time. Thanks for sharing.

My dip was runny and didn't set, but I guess that was because of inadequate cooling/draining the ingredients. It was delicious though!

Excellent and everyone loved it!  It also had great presentation with a WOW factor--great to take to a party. I will be making it again just on a smaller scale!

delicious, but makes a lot!! doesn't need butter.  used spring form. used vodka (instead of vermouth, cause its what i had). used sun-dried tomatoes not packaged in oil & then added a little oil & used my magic bullet to chop up.

I made this for the first time for a couple shower I hosted for 40 people.  I was nervous since I had never made it before but it turned out awesome and many people raved about it!!  Here is what I did a little differently - used a 9" spring form pan - used vodka instead of vermouth - used store bought sun dried tomato spread - used 3 garlic cloves (this was too many, will use 1 - 2 next time) - used 1/4 to 1/2 c more pesto, sun dried tomatoes than called for  served with water crackers and small toasted slice baquettes.

This is one fabulous dip!  I made 2 for a large bridal shower, one with gorgonzola and one with fete.  The gorgonzola dip won-hands down. Thanks for sharing this great appetizer Dana.

I have made this for Christmas parties.  I usually skip the butter, because it seems out of place to me and isn't needed.  I usually mix the pesto and sundried tomatoes together and alternate layers of cheese mixture and tomato pesto mixture and then top with toasted pine nuts when it is unmolded.

Delicious, beautiful and actually quite easy to make!  It was very flavorful and a hit.  I might decrease the feta and butter/increase the cream cheese next time, due to my own preferences, but it really is wonderful as is.  The directions are spot on perfect - easy to follow.  The only other thing I would add is if you're using store bought or very oily pesto, drain it some, or else the dip will "weep" green basil flavored oil - doesn't hurt the taste at all, but distracts from such a pretty presentation.

What a GREAT recipe! Definitely five stars.  I used Clasico Sun dried tomato sauce and spread and drained it through a tight meshed strainer to get all of the oil out.  I'm glad I did because there was quite a large amount of oil drained out.  I also used Clasico Traditional Basil Pesto and did the same with that.  Both of these were VERY flavorful and great choices.  I forgot to toast the pine nuts but they were fine as is. I prepared this the night before so it could sit in the mold overnight.  I was also glad that I used saran wrap first because it made it super easy to take out of the mold.  I got ALOT of compliments on this recipe.  I was told it was CHRONIC. :)

This dip was amazing.  I just made a half recipe for a New Years Eve party, but I thought I'd try a sample first, so I made a smaller version in a small Tupperware container (1/2 cup).  I just meant to taste it (really), but ended up eating the whole sample with toasted baguette and a glass of red wine.  I just couldn't stop myself.  I used ingredients I had on hand, so I omitted the pine nuts and subbed sun dried basil feta for regular feta.  I also subbed 1 1/2 TBSP finely chopped sweet onion for the shallot and vodka for the for the vermouth.  It was completely awesome!  Before I used them, I spread the sundried tomatoes and pesto on quartered paper towels to remove excess oil.  I also whirled the sun dried tomatoes in the food processor, then layered as follows: sun dried tomatoes, cheese mixture, pesto, then another layer of cheese mixture.  I had no problems with excess oil on my serving plate.  Thanks Dana!

This was WONDERFUL!! Did not change anything. If anything I probably used more sundried tomatos than it called for. Makes a ton!! Made this for the family Christmas gathering and my sisters have told me that this is good on much more than crackers! They used leftovers on baked potatoes, hamburgers and said it is good to just "eat" by itself! I put it in a bunt pan as someone else suggested and it came out beautiful. Keep in mind this is not at all an inexpensive dish to make but well worth the cost and effort! Only thing I would change is trying to get some of the oil out of the pesto (I used store bought pesto)

This recipe provides a very generous portion!  We were surprised at how big the dome turned out.  It is a good dip for Christmas because of the red, green, and white colored layers.  I used sun dried tomato cream cheese and mediterranean feta cheese for an extra kick.  If you're using a big bowl, you may have to spread the layers around just the outside rim in order to see them in the finished product.

This is fabulous.I made it for a friend's holiday party.  I sent it early and I arrived late. By the time I made it to the party, it was gone.  Everyone loved it.  I used 1/2 c. butter and the flavor and consistency were great.  One cup seemed like too much to me.  While you maybe tempted to leave it out, I think theconsistency would be too soft to hold the shape.  The presentation of this dish is spactacular, esp. for the holidays.

this dip was really good, and I really liked all of the layers, but take a bite with the tomatoes, pesto, and cheese, it was quite a bit strong.  im not sure what i can do to tone down the cheese layer.  i did use non-salted butter, but maybe feta is high in sodium?  i also only added a 3/4 T minced garlic, so i'm not sure what to do to tone this down.  great presentation, and for the most part, great flavor.  looks christmasy with the colors.

Really good.  Much more flavorful than what I have had previously.  However, I used only one stick of butter, a 4oz. pkg of feta cheese and half of a shallot.  Everything else I left the same.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!  I forwarded this recipe to my sister who made it for my Mom's 60th birthday party and the platter was scrapped clean!  What a hit!  Everyone loved it!  I'm making it this weekend for my sister's baby shower and have to double the recipe because I want some left over!!!  We served it with small melba toasts and hearty crackers...it was awesome!

Pretty and great tasting spread.  A little work but, worth it. My extended family event loved it and ate every morsel begging for the recipe!!  Yet, my boyfriends family didn't seem as thrilled.  It is a FULL flavored dip with strong feta, garlic flavors.  Crowds that are more timid might not like it as well. Great presentation and conversation starter.

I had  pretty good reviews on Christmas when I brought this dish to the inlaws. I followed the recipe pretty closely, other than using vodka instead, and using more sundried tomatoes, drained, and pureed. I also put it in a bundt pan, using only one layer of each ingredient. I used food coloring to dye slivered almonds green for the top layer.. It made for such a beautiful presentation.. very festive and yummy wreath for Christmas!!

In the recipe's defense, I think this one was my fault.  The butter did not blend well at all, but I think maybe I have a problem with my blender.  No one liked this at my house.  I think the feta was too overpowering for them with all the other strong flavors in the recipe.  I don't think I will make this again, but it sounded really good!

Delicious, easy prep, looks colorful, and it's a make ahead appetizer to top it off!  Doesn't get any better in my book. I've seen & tried other versions of this recipe, but I like this one better.  I like the feta and shallots make the difference.  Others loved it too.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Because of previous reviews, I used mild feta.  Next time I will use a flavored feta.  Be sure to drain everything as posted.  Turned out great.  Cut it to 1/3 for six people, just right.

This was very very very good! We made it for a football party and it was a hit. We only used about a half stick of butter. I drained the sundried tomatos and patted them with paper towels. I really think this dip is tasty! And it is best served with water crakers...anything else didnt match the intense flavor ;)

I made this for a girls group, and it was a big hit!  I followed the directions exactly.  The vermouth really makes a difference.  I used sundried tomatoes in oil, and would definitely make more of an effort to drain them next time.

This has a great flavor but the title is a little misleading.  It is not a dip but rather a spread for crackers.

I made this for an Easter open house and not a drop was left.  People loved it.  Plus, this is one you can make the day before and pull out a few minutes early to put out ... I made mine in a short bundt pan so it looked very pretty when inverted onto my serving plate.  Served it up with crackers and Triscuits ... delish!

Thanks to my friend that suggested this, I am afraid I have  developed a new addiction.  This is just fabulous, albeit a tad expensive to make, and so so bad for the hips.  The store was all out of sun-dried tomatoes, so I used jarred sundried tomato pesto in place of the regular pesto. Only had 8 oz feta but did not miss the remainder.  Absolutely use the vermouth or a dry white wine because it really does add to the flavor.  The only other sub was I also toasted some slivered almonds and added to the cheese mixture for a bit of texture; it added a lovely flavor and crunch.  I don't have a mold so used just a bowl.  Now I have reason to go buy a mold.  Thanks so much for this absolutely delicious spread that will steal the show.

I took it to an event where I was the new guy and next thing I knew, the spread was all gone, just a few crackers left. I followed the recipe exactly except I used only one garlic clove. Thanks for helping me look good to the new neighbors!

I served this for a group of neighborhood ladies, and they all loved it and requested the recipe.  It looks pretty and tastes great.  As other reviewers have noted, it is pricey.  It cost me $25 just for the cheeses, pine nuts, pesto and sun-dried tomatoes.

People can't get enough of this stuff.  I've made it several times over the past few years.  It makes a lot, so I made half of a recipe last time and it turned out just fine!

As a general rule, I never serve anything at my parties that I haven't tried out first.  But, I read this recipe a few days ago and thought it would be perfect for the small party I had last night.  It turned out great and was a huge hit!!  I had some problems finding a bowl or mold that appropriate size (thought I had one, but was wrong!) so just used a smaller sized crock and lined it with plastic wrap.  I halfed the ingredients and it worked out perfectly.  A great blend of flavors and textures.  The red, white and green is also a very festive addition to your holiday parties!!

My family regularly eats the ingredients in this dish so I thought I would give this a go for Christmas Day. It looked lovely on the plate but unfortunately, aside from Mum and I, it was not at all popular, very few tasted it more than once. I did not make any changes to the recipe other than using a parsley based pesto sauce.  If I were ever to make this again, I would halve the recipe and serve it only to adventurous tastbuds.

I got rave reviews on this dip.  It was very, very good and looked pretty as well.  I would not make it again though because of the expense.  It cost right at $20 to make.  It does make a lot of dip.  You could easily cut it in half and have plenty.

This was really freaking good!!  I have made several times now and everyone has loved it, it is always gone and I always gets lots of requests for the recipe.  I usually use vodka but last time didn't have any and used red wine vinegar and that was good too.

I wish I had taken everyone's advice and brought copies of the recipe with me . It makes a very large amount so I divided it and brought it to 2 parties. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. It is a little pricey to make but very good.

I was so suprised at the amount of wonderful comments I rec'd from my friends when we had this at a party.  I did find it to be a little too salty for my taste so perhaps using unsalted butter and definately don't add any salt (maybe even cut back on the feta a bit).  I served it with diagonally sliced baguette bread which seemed to be the perfect accompaniment.  We did have left overs but - but it was very well received.  I had only vodka in the house and it went over just fine.  I have friends who hate to cook asking me for this recipe! Thanks again!

If you want to impress your guests, serve this appetizer.  Not only does it taste great, it has nice presentation.  The recipe makes a large amount so you might want to cut it in half for a small gathering.

This is the one! Everyone will be asking you for this recipe. I’ve made this several times, each version gets better. Sorry to change original, but I feel it’s necessary. Original recipe had too much cheese mixture that lacked a creamy texture (that maybe if you process the heck out of the butter you’ll get-but ain’t no one got time for that...) and the butter (and amount of it) is just weird. Take butter out or 2T (if you must), cut feta cheese to 6 oz, and add a puck of garlic and herb Boursin combine all together for smooth Fluffy mixture, Make your own pesto (drain all the oil in a mesh colander), put your sun-dried tomatoes in the food processor to make a paste-Very important-and toast your pine nuts. To prep appetizer- Use appropriate size bowl-spray with oil, use press and seal cling wrap for easy release then a layer of wax paper, then layer ingredients : sun dried tomatoes, pesto, pine nuts, cheese Mixture, sundried tomatoes, pesto, pine nuts and cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Next day uncover and flip over a large platter then flip over the whole bowl upside into platter and shake out the cheese dip, uncover the wax & wrap smooth out with a knife....I like to decorate with fresh basil leaves -and sprinkle generously with more pine nuts and the drizzle with high end EVOO and a dash of finishing salt. Only serve with freshly baked sliced Italian loaf or baguette! So amazing! You will be glad you made it. Secret Tip-if you are pressed for time-grab Bo

Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  Didn't have pesto on hand so substituted artichoke tapenade and added olive tapenade. Assembly took a bit of trial and error but once I took a good look at the picture got the hang of it. Served on a plate of basil drizzled with a bit of fig balsamic vinegar. Added the pine nuts after inverting onto the plate since I didn't have them on hand initially. It looked as good as it tasted.

Presents beautifully, but the cream cheese portion was FAR too buttery - if I make it again I would probably skip the butter entirely.

Excellent, only problem, I did not read the recipe through before making and did not divide the ingredients so they were not in two layers of each ingredient as the recipe calls for.  Even so was loved by all who tried it but I know it would have been better if made as intended.

Even with the expensive items this one calls for it is SO SO SO worth it. It has the best taste and looks awesome. For a fancy holiday get together this is the go to dip. I use water crackers like it calls for and I dont think I have ever used the capers. I use lots of pine nuts and extra garlic and sundried tomatoes. I usually halve it also or make two because it does make a large portion.

I didn't make this but my sister served it during a wedding weekend at her house.  Absolutely DELISH!   I couldn't walk past it without slathering some  on a cracker.  It's very colorful and attractive,too.  Can't wait to make it at my house!
I don't know why it's called "dip" though, as it clearly isn't.   I will rename it when I make it.

I made this last night for a friend's father's 80th birthday party.  It was wonderful.  In fact, one guest said he loved it so much he was ready to "rub it all over his body".  I guess he liked it!  I had a small jar of chopped black olives that I didn't know what to do with, so I sprinkled that as my first step.  It added another layer of color and texture but certainly wasn't necessary to the flavor or visual appeal.  I will be making this many, many more times in the future.  It was the first time that something I made became the talk of the party!  Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe!

Festive spread (more so then a dip) for Christmas. It tastes far better after a few days in frig after flavors have matured and married. The tomatoes were too chewy at first, so next time I will soften them by rinsing well under warm water. I did drain the pesto as suggested by another few reviewers to avoid the excess olive oil mess. The toasted pine nuts supply a nice crunch when eaten within the first 24 hours, but they do soften up, loosing their crunch by absorbing moisture from the other ingredients. The flavors work wonderfully together!

This was a great dip, and I used it in a pancetta lined Halloween mask to use as a mold for a Silence of the Lambs effect.  The mixture of the sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and pesto made a great effect for a Halloween theme.

Each of the 5 stars I have rated this are VERY well-deserved.  I served this at a party we had last weekend and have promised to share the recipe with no less than 6 people!  I especially like this recipe because the techniques (like lining the mold with Saran Wrap) and ingredients used allow me to adapt this recipe to other favorite flavors.  Thanks for this GREAT recipe, Dana!

I used gin and served with watercrackers.  Everyone loved it!  I only made half the recipe and it was plenty.  I may try it sans butter and with more cream cheese next time... just because it seems healthier that way!

I made this for a New Year's eve party and my guests thought I was some sort of epicurian goddess!  I made 6 individual small tortes out of the recipe using some Pampered Chef prep bowls.  I served 3 that evening, brought 1 over to a New Year's Day gathering, gave 1 to a friend, and had one left over at home.  This worked much better than one giant torte.

This is an appetizer with excellent visual appeal. For a little variety, try substituting goat cheese for the feta. It's wonderful!

This dip was delicious!  I made it for my New year's Eve cocktail party and it was a real hit.  It looks so beautiful on the table, and tastes delicious.  The dip is so flavorful, I served it with water crackers and wheat thins.  I will definitely make this again!  (I also processed the sun dried tomatoes in the food processor with a little olive oil, instead of it being chunky.)

I would not hesitate to make this again. Cut the recipe in half for a party of 16 and there was plenty left over. I did not make the double layer as suggested I thought it would be too over powering. I used a small saucepan for my mold and it came out great.

Excellent Dip!  After tasting just the cheese mixture during prep, I have to say I had reservations so far as to call my husband and tell him I may need a back up appetizer for the party we were going to.  But was I pleasantly surprised.  Used minced onions instead of shallots amd vodka instead of vermouth.  The flavors are dreamy and we all devoured it!!  Thanks!

Made this with my two children to take to a church potluck.  It disappeared!  Made fresh pesto from our garden and left out the pine nuts due to nut allergies.  It was great!

This was awesome! I halved the recipe as there were only 10 of us at my wine tasting.  Everyone flipped over it.  I served it with toasted baguette slices - yum.  Can't wait to make it during the holidays.  Very impressive dish!

This dip was awesome!  We had at least ten appetizers at a party, and this dip was the first to go.  It makes a lot, so I plan to cut it in thirds and make it just for me with a glass of wine.

Great Flavor! Dish was a little difficult to layer, certainly did'nt come out to look like the photo. Will definetley work on the tequnique because the taste was amazing. Added a small amount of Cayenne Pepper to the cheese mixture for a bit of a kick, and a little Asiago cheese for a little more flavor.

I made this for my parents' 50th anniversary and it was a great hit!  So many people asked for the recipe.  Definately drain the pesto and use a creamy feta.  It was great with the halved mini pitas someone suggested.

Only one person liked this. I don't know what it was but it just wasn't much of a hit. Personally I think the feta was a bit overpowering.

Great gourmet flavor for the garlic, pesto, sundried tomato lovers! I made it for a Christmas party. I assembled it in a bundt cake pan before flipping it over on a serving platter and it looked like a Christmas wreath with the green pesto and the red sun dried tomatoes. Great presentation! I also omitted the butter, it is unnecessary with all the cheese and other flavors. Will definitely make again, very original and a good change from the typical taco/pizza dips at a potluck!

This is so delicious.  It is very flavorful and rich.  I love the combination of flavors.  It is pricey to make but well worth it.

I made this as written, except I forgot to repeat the layers...just put it all in my mold layered one time.  Doesn't matter though; it still turned out so incredibly delicious; very rich though!  A wonderful combination of flavors.  Everyone liked this one!  Thank you, Dana!

Ok, so this is tasty but it's really strong.  It's one of those dips that I'll have a couple bites of and be done for a while.  Tastes elegant just don't have only this if you're entertaining.

I made this for my wifes book club.  I never had a taste, so I really don't know how good it turned out, but based on the results, I'm giving it a 5.  Everyone in the club wanted the recipe, and even asked me if I'd cater thier next event.  But of course I will..
Next time, I'll get mine first.

15 guests and nothing left...oops
I served it with turkish bread (pide).
Looks good, taste is even better. I added less feta, next time I will try goats cheese instead of the feta.

As others have mentioned, this was time intensive and expensive, but the results were terrific.  It was a beautiful and delicious dip.  Next time I'll add more sundried tomatoes for even more color and flavor.  Wonderful!

Ok, I"m going to give this 5 stars, BUT it was sure helpful to read the feedback from previous makers before I endeavored to create it myself. A) it was absolutely delicious B) it was expensive and C) it was more work than I was expecting.  However, all in all I would say that if you have the money and the time it is well worth making. The flavours are distinct and yet blend beautifully. I made it in a rounded old tupperware bowl (full recipe since it was for 25 people at a baby shower) and it was stunning looking too. I put out a butter knife as well as the crackers, etc, so people could cut themselves a wedge.

Awesome, I have people wanting the recipe so they can take it everywhere they go. I use Vodka instead of vermouth and it is still delicious. I also use the sundried tomato and basil feta for some extra flavor.

Excellent recipe, this got raves & recipe requests from our Christmas gathering.  I substituted the basil pesto for a Basil, Parmesan & Cashew dip & I was pleased with taste.  A few commented on the heavy garlic taste but I don't think it spoiled the dip at all.  Oh by the way I halved the recipe and still had plenty to fill a fancy jelly mold. Will definatley make again this week for another function.

I made this dip also for a small dinner party and I cut way down on the butter and the feta, and added just a couple of tablespoons of each (it was still a bit salty)  but it was still sooooo good.  I think this would be superb with goat cheese instead of feta and I will try that next time.  Beautiful presentation and excellent taste!

This was really good.  Makes for a beautiful presentation.  I made in a heart shaped pan for a Valentine's party and it looked fabulous.  Might also be nice to prepare in custard cups and serve individually as an appetizer for a sit-down dinner.  Highly recommended.

This was a hit at a birthday gathering.  I got carried away with the garlic but everyone seemed to like it!!!  I halved the recipe as someone previously mentioned and it was the perfect serving size.  Will definitely keep this one in my archives.

This was very easy if you follow the directions.  I cut the butter to 1/2 Cup and I cut the feta to 6 oz.  It made a very nice size dip.  It was a hit.   The dip is very pretty and impressive!

I’m thinking about cutting out the butter altogether next time I make it.

I have been making this recipe for years. I make it in smaller containers and freeze it. When I need an appetizer I just pull one of the containers out of the freezer.  This is always a hit at gatherings.

I made this for the first time today for a church choir party. Everyone absolutely loved it!!! I recommend oiling the entire bowl, rim and all, before laying in the plastic wrap. Otherwise, the plastic wrap will stick to the bowl, and not want to be formed into the bottom. Also, remember to save half of the ingredients for the second layer!

There really is no substitute similar to the pine nuts, but, if you must I would recommend finely chopped walnuts. I see that someone tried almonds and didn’t like it. I don’t recommend almonds, because they give a strong, distinctive flavor that changes a dish.

I made this because of the reviews. I don't normally make this type of appetizer but I was intrigued. It was fantastic! I didn't have vermouth so I used gin instead. I took it to work for a Christmas potluck and everyone wanted to know what was in it. Very garlicky! Maybe I'll use only one large clove next time.

I just realized that the recipe I have for this dip, cut out of something 15 years ago, is this recipe by the same author. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve used it and what good comments I’ve gotten.  I just noticed when making it up yesterday that it was noted as an AllRecipes recipe!  It does make a lot and I often cut the recipe by half. It’s a great Christmas gathering appetizer.

I made this to bring to a holiday party last weekend. The colors were perfect for the holidays. The recipe makes quite a lot which is good because it is a dish of delish! I served this beautifully layered spread on a large platter in a pool of drained and finely chopped roasted red peppers and on top of that a pool of marinated, drained and chopped artichoke hearts. I surrounded the spread with fresh herbs, olives, and a few capers. I drained all of the wet ingredients in the spread and it turned out very pretty and very tasty. I served it with thin slices of crusty Italian bread and some crackers. I am making it again today. This time I will make a few smaller portions and place them in the freezer to get out over the holidays. Thank you for posting the recipe!!

Loved the taste but not how messy it looked.  The second time I made this I put it in a six inch round springform pan and drained the pesto really well in a strainer.  Also I made a tomato pesto by processing the tomatoes and pine nuts together in a food processor and draining that very well in a strainer.  No more drippiness and it looked much neater.  I agree that slices of baguette make more sense than using crackers.  At Christmas I decorated the top with a wreath of basil leaves.  This is a great recipe as long as you drain the pestos REALLY WELL to get rid of the excess oil.  This is definitely a keeper.

I TOO HAVE MADE THIS CHEESE SPREAD EVERY CHRISTMAS FOR  OVER 20 YEARS.
THOUGH, INSTEAD OF VERMOUTH I USE A LOVELY  MERLOT WINE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR. EVEN MY SON -  MIKE THE CHEF SAYS IT;S THE BEST.
OF COURSE IT IS - AFTER ALL - WHO TAUGHT MIKE 'THE CHEF TO LOVE COOKING GREAT FOOD BUT ME
ENJOY - HAPPY HOLIDAYS

I followed the recipe mostly. First I cut it in half based on reviews and how many guests we were having. Second I used vodka since I had it on hand. I did not use a mold instead I just layered it in a nice serving dish. I served it with toasted bread, it was well liked by most everyone. The only negative I have is, although I am a garlic lover, the blended cloves left this with some heat, a bit too much for me.

A rich and flavorsome dip! A crowd that enjoys Mediterranean flavors will enjoy this. The only change for next time, would be  to reduce the butter content slightly.

I read the reviews and made a few adjustments.  I drained the sun-dried tomatoes and put them in a paper towel to squeeze out excess oil.  I made the pesto from scratch for more flavor.  I used to packages of basil and still didn't have enough to make a full layer.  But - I did not put a lot of oil in it.  Greasing the bowl and laying in saran wrap is genius.  I reduced the garlic to one clove total between the cheese and the pesto.  I also did not have a food processor large enough so I worked with a hand mixer in addition to a small cuisinart and it came out beautifully.  It literally tastes like a full pan of lasagna in every bite.  Oh - make sure you toast your pine nuts for ~ 4 minutes.

I made this dip to take to work, all my co-workers loved it! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and drained as much oil out of the sun dried tomatoes and pesto and food processed the sun dried tomatoes. I also bought sliced, toasted garlic baguette to go along with the dip. It was a perfect combination! My only recommendations would be to cut the butter in half and add another cream cheese instead, also, it does make a lot of the cream cheese/feta fix, so if you plan on layering I would do a little extra sun dried tomato and a little extra pesto on hand. Hope everyone enjoys the dip as I did!

Amazing!  The only thing I did wrong is used salted butter because  that was only thing I had in the house.  Make sure you use unsalted, this dip is delicious, but mine was a bit too salty.

Outstanding recipe for a special occasion.  The taste and the presentation are incredible.  I reduced the cheese mixture to half the recipe, and this was a perfect amount.  Like many folks, I used vodka.  I molded my dip into a 5-cup, square, storage container, and this was perfect for molding, storing, and carrying.  I sprayed my mold with Pam, rather than oiling it.   Like some folks, I made homemade pesto sauce, so that I could control the amount of oil:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Pesto-Sauce/Detail.aspx             I used the whole pesto recipe, and reduced the oil to only 1/4 cup.  You could easily make only half the pesto recipe if you want.

So yummy! I drained the sun dried tomatoes and the pesto for about 20 minutes.  Set the dip in a pretty mold and covered overnight.  Turned out wonderful.  As stated in other reviews, everyone loved and wanted the recipe.  Can't wait to make again.

I accidentally purchased crumbled bleu cheese instead of feta, and THAT worked great, and received rave reviews!  Other than selecting the wrong cheese, I followed the directions exactly, and the layered cheese spread release easily onto a plate.  THIS dip is DEFINITELY an "A-List" recipe!

I loved the concept of the recipe but changed it up by omitting the butter, garlic and shallots and added grated lemon peel to the cream cheese and feta mixture. It made this a lighter and fresher tasting spread. I also added chopped kalamata olives to the sun dried tomato layer. This is always a welcomed appetizer for any holiday event.

Everyone at the party loved this spread!  The next time I bring it to an event, however, I plan on making crostinis and serving it with those instead of the crackers that I used.  This dip requires a larger surface area to achieve the full effect of its awesomeness!

What a great recipe!!!! A little time consuming but oh so worth it!!! The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was dry vermouth but subbed vodka like others suggested. Used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, rinsed and patted dry, then chopped in my mini processor. Had homemade pesto in the freezer and for people talking how expensive pine nuts are, check Trader Joes!!!

I have been making this spread for years. It is always the biggest hit and I am always asked by family and friends if I would be making again. Highly recommend it. I  use a full package of cream cheese for each layer and have found this makes it easier to spread.

This recipe is fantastic as is, but I subbed goat cheese for the feta, and it is to die for!  I omitted the pine nuts the second time around because I didn't think they added much flavor and they are SO expensive! Thank you!

I halfed the recipe. Mixed 4 OZ  Feta into cream cheese. Mixed small jar of artichoke Hearts drained and chopped fine with the pesto. Excellent!

This was awesome!  Brought it to a family gathering and everyone loved it.  I didn't add the vermouth - just didn't have any on hand.  I agree with some of the other comments - this has very bold flavor and next time I'll serve it with a nice crusty bread instead of crackers.

This was fantastic.  I needed a quick, throw together appetizer and this was it.  As suggested, I cut the cheese portion in half.  I put the sun dried tomatoes in the food process to chop a bit.  I also added garlic to the cheese portion.  
I didn't have a mold so I used a small round bowl, lined it with plastic wrap, and threw it in the freezer for about 45 minutes (I was in a hurry).  Unwrapped and put on a round plate with baguette slices... A beautiful presentation which looked like I had spent hours.  Definitely a "do again!"

Just came from my daughters house....I loved this dip! She made it in 4 separate containers so she could take take it to the various family gatherings, and sent a container home with me! I liked the saltiness and all the flavors that come forth on this dip. It tastes a bit like an Italian type dish, with a twist. First bite, I wasn't sure about it, but each bite after that, was addictive. Really, really like it.

I made this recipe for a birthday party. I used an 8 inch springform pan. I only put one layer of the tomatoes, pine nuts and pesto.  I decided to put some raspberry balsamic vinegar atop the cheese as well as around the mold itself.  I got rave reviews and the vinegar paired nicely with the flavors.

I did as many suggested and used sourdough baguette. 

My family just loved this. I will certainly make it again. Thank you for the recipe :-)

This is my go-to for the holidays.  It is SOOOOOO delicious but so fattening it's the only time of year I'll make it (when there are scores of people to help eat it.)  I'm going to go make some right now....didn't buy vermouth so I'm gonna try dry white wine in its place.

Awesome!  Best dip ever!!  I halved this and it was plenty. Don't skip the pine nuts - buy them in the bulk section so you don't have to buy more than you need. Excellent!

This is a WONDERFUL dip that everyone seems to love. I always put the sun-dried tomatoes in the food processor so that the pieces are smaller. I serve it with the flavored bruschetta pieces you can get at the grocery store - our favorite is garlic parmesan. It's a great treat, but the ingredients are expensive, so save it for those special occasions!

This dip took a lot of time and money, but was worth it.  I think I spent about thrity dollars on it. I found that costco had the best pesto and sundried tomatoes.  I served this to about 20 hungrey guest and still had lots left over.  Nest time I make it I plan to cut it in half!

This was very good, but a bit spicy for me.  I halved the butter and cut down a little on the feta and garlic.  I added a few tablespoons caesar dressing at the end because it seemed a little too thick.  (I made my own pesto because it isn't available in rural areas.)  It would be great for a special event.

I had this dip over the weekend - the woman that made it covered it with layered provolone cheese that was cut into flower shapes with a cookie cutter, then she put a cheese knife in the top to serve it. Delicious, and looks good, too!

I have been meaning to rate this for ages - it is absolutely delicious -  incredibly unhealthy and fattening but, still, delicious.  I made it for New Year's Eve 2004 (I told you I'd been meaning to rate if for awhile!) and we ate almost all of it even though there were only 8 of us...yum.

I thought it was a little too strong - and I LOVE garlic.  I also didn't feel that the overall dish was worth the amount of work put into it.

This recipe is simply fabulous!  The only changes I made were to go light on the garlic and shallots and omit the vermouth.  We held a wine tasting party and it was an instant hit!  Thanks for sharing this Dana!

Amazing and wonderful! I couldn't believe that I had everything on hand except the pine nuts, so didn't break my bank just to try. My family is begging me to make again. Turned the afternoon into a cheese and wine sampling. Thanks so much.

Funny story!  I almost threw this dish away because I thought it was ugly when I was finished.  My husband convinced me to bring it to the party... and I can not believe what a hit it was!!!!  People were complimenting me on how beautiful it was and how delicious it was.  It was the biggest "surprise of a dish" ever!  I tried it myself and it was AWESOME!  Everyone at the event wants the recipe!

My, did this one get rave reviews from my guests! I used less feta and pesto and substituted sundried tomatoes in oil as one reviewer suggested. I put basil leaves around the bottom and one on top. It looked very professional and tasted wonderful. I will make it often. I also made the cheese mixture the day before to cut down on prep time on the day.

I've made this twice now.  Everyone loved it and it makes an impressive presentation.  The flavor is bold but delicious. It is more of a spread - have spreading knives on hand!

This was good and very pretty, but way to salty with all the feta.  Also, the cheese layers were pretty stiff.  We liked it, but I'll revise the recipe next time I make it.

Great recipe!  I took it to a party and it disappeared quickly.  I got plenty of compliments too.  I halved the recipe and used vodka instead of vermouth as others suggested -- worked nicely.

Made it with vodka, twice now, and everyone *loves* this recipe.  I've been asked to bring it to the next function.  I recommend serving with water crackers, since heavy crackers are not needed and detract from the spread.

Made this recipe for a party and everyone thought it was delicious...this would be great for an open house or some event where you bring a big appetizer. For 8 people, we barely even made a dent in it. Next time I would half the recipe to make it a little smaller. Very different and extremely tasty!

All gone! I always dislike having leftovers and this recipe did not let me down. Beautiful presentation and flavor to match. I halved the butter and doubled the cream cheese. Before I left the house I made copies of the recipe to give out and those were snatched up as well.

As an experiment, I made this recipe for a group of non-adventurous eaters.  It has very unique tastes and it not the average run of the mill appetizer.  Just one tip, some people were reluctant to try the spread because they thought the sun-dried tomatoes were chiles.  I added a note and it was a big hit.

This went over very well.  I think next time I will add slivered almonds also.
