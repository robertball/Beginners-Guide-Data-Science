As the recipe stands, I did not enjoy it.  But with one simple tweak it came alive: sea salt.  Without the salt, the flavour is plain and hardly comes alive.  But once I added salt to the mix, everything was jigging and jiving, and my tongue thanked me greatly!  As it is being used on fatty cuts such as lamb, it will not leach out too much liquid.  If salt had been added, I would have given this 4-5 stars.  Cheers!

when i rubbed the spices in, i did it with a bit of olive oil. when i cooked it, i added a couple slivers of garlic and a little wine, and then i reduced the sauce to a couple tablespoons. It was really really good.

Did not care for this spice rub at all. It left very little in the way of flavor. My grilled lamb chops with an acid based marinade have always turned out much better tasting. I wanted to try something new, but the chops were not good with this spice rub.

It's also great for pork loin roast! I make this up in bulk and keep it in a labeled airtight jar.  I add 1 1/2 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp granulated garlic, and omit the curry (nobody here likes curry)  Then I use about 2-3 Tablespoons of the mixture rubbed onto the fat side of the pork roast.  When I remember to do it, I poke holes into the roast first, with a fork to let the flavor penetrate.  Mmmm good!

This was pretty good, I made up a lot, so I would have more later. I used it this time on lamb chops that I grilled over wood coals. I also let the rub stay on the chops overnight before grilling. Very tasty.

This was very good. I did add some salt and pepper as suggested by some other reviewers and I feel it did bring out the flavor. I used a mild Jamaican curry. I love Cumin and you just can't go wrong with anything it goes in. :)

VERY good rub.  We added sea salt as well and it was great.

This rub was great on the roast I made last night. I added a small amount of salt and fresh ground pepper to the rub, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

Very good but Iâ€™m giving it a 4 because there is no salt.  I added salt and pepper  and it made a big difference!

This has an incredible smell! I used a sweet paprika in mine, but think next time I'll use a smoky paprika!

I love this recipe, and so does my family. We tried something different, yesterday, though, and put it on a roast, two days ago, then yesterday, we put it in our smoker, with mesquite briquettes. It was so good.
