We loved this meal.  It will become a standby I can tell.  I did alter the original recipe A LOT based on the suggestions people made.  I broiled 5 jalapeno peppers and peeled the skins (that was a pain).  After I put the first cheese layer down I cut the peppers up roughly and put them on top of the cheese. I chopped up a bunch of scallions/green onions and put those down next.  Then the can of chopped jalapenos.  Then sprinkled some frozen corn on top of that.  I added red pepper (cayenne) to the flour before mixing in the milk (1%).  I cooked it until the top was a little brown.  Served it with lowfat sour cream, Green Mountain Gringo salsa, more scallions and green tomatillo sauce.  It was SOOO good.

Quicker and easier than regular chile relleno, well worth doing the casserole over the regular recipe

Delicious! I made several changes to the recipe--I roasted 5 fresh green chiles under the broiler, peeled them and used them as the base for the casserole. I also used half aged white cheddar and half jack cheese. The result was great--my husband and I ate it in one sitting.

I LOVE chile rellano!  My mom always made it.  If you want to add a little spice to it, use jalapeno jack cheese instead of the regular monterey jack.  Happy Eatings!

I just added 2 cloves of minced garlic & some salt to taste.  I served this as a brunch dish to my Hospice Training class.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.  Topped with Thick & Spicy Salsa that had fresh cilantro added to it. Passing the recipe to all in my class as per their request.  I will certainly make this again.  Lynn Komoda

Another winner recipe in our family. Next time, though, I plan on adding some hot sauce or red pepper to give it a kick. Otherwise, very tasty and will definitely do again.

This recipe was very easy to prepare, and tasted great. There is a lot of room to experiment with this dish, which is good as is, or can be spiced up for those who like their food a little hotter. A good meal when you're in a hurry!

Very good, but I changed the recipe quite a bit.  I used chopped poblano peppers instead of the canned chilis.  I also added other vegetables to the mixture - black olives, mushrooms, etc.

I'm always on the lookout for quick and tasty recipes and this was both!  I followed the directions exactly and my family found it tasted as good as "a restaurant dish" at an authenic Mexican restaurant.  I served it with baked creamed corn and green salad for an excellent light supper.

This was not a tasty dish, it was bland and did not look appealing at the table.  I served it with tacos and my family did not enjoy this version of Chiles Rellenos.

I adore this recipe.  I usually roast my own chilis over the grill and add them.  Tonight I am adding leftover chicken to it to make it a little more hearty.  Cant wait!
