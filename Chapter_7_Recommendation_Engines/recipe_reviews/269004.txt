Excellent idea!  In fact I did that very thing the other night before I ever saw this recipe.  Why have we been messing with that large pot of water to cook pasta all this time??  It takes a little watching at first but so much easier to clean up.  Try it, you'll wish you'd been doing this all along.

Very easy and quick.  Best thing I noticed is that the sauce seeps into the noodles giving them more flavor and the sauce seems to stick to the noodles which is great if you like sauce and noddles in every forkful.  Of course cleanup was easy too.

I am NOT a novice cook and it took 50 minutes to cook this and 3 cups of water. Total waste of time and effort.

Iâ€™ve made this for years from a recipe named Cuban spaghetti maybe? Slight changes, I substitute the water with chicken broth, make it with ground beef and add a larger can of sliced black olives towards the end. I had been thinking of trying sausage, next time I will!

Turned out delicious! I had 1.5 lbs of beef to use, added 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, and some salt and pepper. Cooked the garlic, then onion, then ground beef. Ended up not needing to cook as long with the pasta at the end, maybe only 12 mins or so. Sauce does cook down a lot so if you want it more saucy, add more to start. Will definitely make again!

I had to add a couple more cups of water because the sauce was too thick but overall it tasted really good.

We loved this.  I added mushrooms and a can of tomatoes, and extra pasta sauce and topped it with lots of shaved parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make this again and again.  I love one pot meals!

Cooking the spaghetti in one pan gives the pasta more flavor. My husband thought this was the best spaghetti ever.  I didn't modify the recipe, it is delicious.
