Ever since I first found this recipe on this site 3 years ago, I have made this dish a million times!  Huge thing I did notice was that it is very important you use a METAL dish rather than a glass one.  Never, ever turned out properly in the glass dish!  Use exactly 2.5 lbs of RED potatoes and cut them a bit bigger than diced, bit smaller than quartered, unsalted butter all the way through and if you don't have seasoned breadcrumbs, add parmesan, Italian Seasoning and garlic salt to the plain kind and it'll turn out perfectly.  Double your ham, and use extra melted unsalted butter on the crumbs. I have honestly made this for dozens and dozens of people and have yet for a single person to not love it!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Terri! PS Also makes great leftovers!

Recipe was fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  I took some advice of previous reviews and altered it by doubling the ham and only using 2 1/2 lbs yukon gold potatoes along with using 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Also used 1 1/2 lbs of cheddar cheese and garlic bread crumbs. I also did not cook the potatoes 1st, just let it cook all together in the oven.

Very, very good.  I used the entire 5lbs. of potatoes (minus 2), and I omitted (on accident) the salt and pepper.  I salted the water to boil the potatoes, but I completely forgot to season the dish.  The next time I make this, I will pepper to taste, but leave out the salt entirely - between the ham, soup, and cheese, it didn't need any (and I general like more salt than most people).  I used a pound of deli sliced honey ham, chopped, and it was perfect.  The only suggestion I have is to mix everything except the potatoes in a large bowl FIRST, and then combine.  It's a very large dish, so it was a little difficult to mix.  It was delicious though, and I will definitely make this again.  Perfect for a potluck, we had tons of leftovers.

I followed previous reviewer's comments and reduced the amount of potatoes while increasing the amount of ham-great meal.

I choose this recipe for my family one night because it met a few requirements.  One, it was easy.  Two, didn't have a lot of ingredients and Three, didn't take a long time to make.  I was satisfied.  I took all the other suggestions and made my adjustments.  Less potatoes cut in small pieces, more soup, more ham, NO SALT!  Everyone in the house loved it.  LOVED it.  My husband asks for it all the time!  I like as well but it is a bit salty even with eliminating the salt which is odd but I am the only one in the family that is a salt-aholic.  I can't seem to locate a low salt or no salt Cream of Chix soup but I will see if I can find a low salt ham to use instead.

I loved this!!!!  I ate every last bite of it over three days (and it is better as leftovers!).  My hwdlc (husband who doesn't like casseroles) even ate it.  He didn't do summersaults, but he willingly ate it.  

I used cream of mushroom soup and I think I would always use that instead of cream of chicken.  Plus I used more cheese (can you ever have to much cheese?) and did what someone before suggested for the breadcrumbs, used regular breadcrumb and added Parmesan cheese to the crumbs.

This recipe is a standard for potlucks in our house and everyone loves it. To make it even easier (which I always do) use a package of frozen hashbrowns (thawed)in place of the red potatoes. Then all you have to do is mix everything together, put it in the pan and bake it. Comes out perfect.

Good recipe.  I did not have cream of chicken, so I substituted cream of mushroom.  I also cut down the butter, it really doesnt need much.  Tasted like a big baked potato!  Would be great for a potluck dish...

I followed this recipe closely and would say- less butter!  It was literally floating in it.  And I cook with vats of butter.  Even with that, it's yummy.  Note that mine came out about the consistancy of mashed potatoes- and with the butter, a bit runny at that.  I would also prefer maybe bacon or smaller (trace) pieces of ham.  Enjoy!

Potatoes were excellent everyone loved it. I found the ham oddly out of place, next time I may go with bacon for myown personal taste, I also added some thyme.

This is a wonderful recipe as is. However, for a nice flavor boost, try ROASTING the quartered potatoes first. The goal is to get that nice roasted flavor without overbaking so that they still hold up in the casserole. So I roasted at 375 for 15 min, then turned the oven to 'broil' for the last 5 min. Perfectly crisp outside, but not mushy. Then follow the directions as stated. I also added 1 tsp of Dijon mustard because the ham-cheese-potato combo is divine with a little Dijon!

This was good, but I probably won't make again.  It is easier to make with frozen hashbrowns and my daughter likes it better that way.  I admit to preferring the red potatoes, it has a more mature taste that way.

Really good & quick.  I did make changes, but I am sure the recipe is still 5 stars as stated!  I used Yukon golds,  bacon in place of ham, decreased the sour cream & butter by half and used two cans of cream of mushroom soup.  My family ate the entire pan...no leftovers!  Thanks for sharing you recipe!

We loved this!  I altered the recipe slightly. I boiled and shredded the potatoes before mixing it with the other ingredients.   I also omitted the ham since I was serving it at a pot luck where ham was the main dish. Rave reviews by everyone who attended the pot luck!

Am I the only person who's amused/irritated by people who change the recipe (or don't read it well to begin with) and then rate it down for their results?  

Great recipe! For family preference, I went with twice as much onion and 4 cloves of crushed garlic - lightly sauteed, and I used just regular ol' russets because that was what we had. :) I would caution people against feeling the need to add more liquid. The "dressing" thins very well when poured on top of the hot potatoes, and sets up again when cooling. I think changing the amounts of potato and ham might depend on what you're using this dish for, but we like the ratio just as it's written. It's perfect for a potluck! Thank you!

I don't care for casseroles, but this is very tasty.  I love potatos, sour cream, onions, and cheddar cheese, so I thought I'd give it a try.  My boyfriend loves casseroles and I know he'll enjoy it when I take it to him tonight.  I did change the recipe to suit myself.  I cut the potatos into smaller pieces. I used reduced fat sour cream and chicken instead of ham.  I cooked the chicken with onion powder.  I mixed a second can of soup with a small amount of milk to make a gravy and simmered the cooked chicken with some green onions in the "gravy" for about 5 minutes.  For the potato mixture I used half the cheddar cheese and after putting the chicken and cooked green onions on top of the potatos, I added more green onions and sprinkled the remaining amount of cheese on top, foregoing the bread crumbs.  I think the 1/2 cup of butter is too much.  So next time I'll cut that in half. This smelled wonderful when cooking in the oven.  The sour cream gives it a nice taste.  I'll be making this again, especially if the boyfriend loves it.

This was sooo good!My husband said over and over how much he liked it!I followed some of the previous advice and used about 3 lbs. of potatoes and twice the ham.For the sake of calorie watching I left out the butter,used half the cheese(which was low-fat mozzerella)and sour cream(which was non fat),and only used half the crumb mixture.None of these changes were detrimental to the feel of the dish,but make a big impact calorie-wise.I also used Cambell's cream of mushroon with roasted garlic soup instead of the cr.of chicken.I'm really glad the I didn't cut the recipe in half like I had originally planned,because now we have leftovers!

Cooked this for a large group of people and it went over great! I used about 2 1/2 cups ham and we didn't have bread crumbs so I used garlic parmesan croutons crushed up and added more parmesan cheese. I really liked the crunch from the croutons. Got rave reviews and I will be making it again.

We thought this was only ok. I did use only half the potatoes and cut them up in reasonable sizes. I put 2 cups of chopped ham in it, but it definately could've used more. I also think it calls for way too many bread crumbs on top, and an addition of either fresh mushrooms and/or chopped hard-boiled eggs could have improved this dish.

This was very good, however, I ommitted the 1/2 cup butter in the casserole.  It is rich enough, fattening enough, and tasty enough without the added grease.  I really don't understand why anyone would add it unless their goal is to clog their arteries as much as possible.  As for the topping, I mixed 2 tbsp. melted butter with 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs.

Very filling...great comfort food!  I did not cook the potatoes beforehand, and cooked the dish for about an hour and a half covered, then added the breadcrumbs and cooked a half hour longer uncovered.  I would recommend either cutting the butter in half or not adding it at all.  I used Panko breadcrumbs and did not add more butter to the top...it was swimming in butter.  I did not add salt as others recommended.  Instead of sour cream I used an onion/chive potato topper which was very good!  I also added garlic and celery.

Funny. Seems like my review of this disappeared.

I wanted to add vegetables to mine, so I did shredded cabbage, shredded carrots, half of a sweet onion and shredded potatoes. I used turkey ham, as it's cheaper. I also used cream of mushroom AND southwest pepperjack soups, as that's what I had on hand, and increased the cheese. I added a little Tabasco and garlic powder and milk as well. I also cooked this in the crockpot, to save us from sweltering in the house on a hot day. My husband had three servings of this last night and I had two. We both fell in love with this. I am SO making this again. This would be good with another cup of milk and made into a thick soup for winter!

We really liked this dish! Agree with others that it would be great for a potluck. Used 4lbs potatoes(cut into squares), 4 1/2c of ham, doubled the cheese & green onions, cut down alittle on butter, & didn't add salt. The bread crumbs seemed to be way over the top, but once cooked were pretty good. Will maybe add less next time & mix butter/bread crumbs before adding(as someone suggested). Had to use a larger baking dish & cook longer(since the center was still cool). Overall a great dish. Thanks!

Wow. I thought this was going to be ho-hum- boy was I wrong. I don't normally change anything the first time I make a recipe. I made an exception here by leaving out the 1/2 cup butter in the filling just to cut down on the saturated fat (I did drizzle some over the bread crumbs). Per other reviewers' advice, I also used 2.5 lbs of potatoes. Other than those 2 things I stuck to the recipe and it was amazing. I truly don't think you'll miss the butter as this recipe is already savory- this is what I would call comfort food.

Oh my goodness, this was GOOD!  I ended up doubling the other ingredients but left the potato quantity the same.  I covered it with foil to bake; should have uncovered it sooner so that some of the liquid would have evaporated off more...it was a little runny the first evening we had it.  But leftovers were perfect!  I highly recommend this dish; it will become a fall/winter staple at our house.

I did a half recipe, as there are just 3 of us here. I substituted cream of mushroom for the chicken soup and (accidentally) added the whole can. Other substitutions were: used leftover garlic mashed potatoes, left out the salt, used Italian-style bread crumbs, cut WAY back on the butter and topped the whole thing with fresh mushrooms.

It turned out fantastic! My dad, who never has more than 2 servings, went back for a smaller 3rd serving. It definitely doesn't need added salt (the ham has enough as it is).

I was short on time so used another's advice and mixed a bag of frozen hashbrowns instead of pre-boiling potatoes.  I felt the dish was easy to make and tasted good - but there was too much butter. It was dripping/oily.  Next time I'll cut to 1/4 cup mixed in and possibly less drizzled on top.  I used plain panko breadcrumbs and some shredded parmesan.

Very very good. We all enjoyed it. Used a bit more ham and less potatoes than called for and I only had Idaho potatoes so that's what I used. I used leftover ham from Christmas to make this and it was definitely a winner.

Very yummy!  One thing the recipe did not specify was whether the butter that makes up the sauce should be room temp or melted.  I melted it and whisked all the sauce ingredients together to insure it would be creamy and free of any lumps.  I used low sodium ham and reduced fat cream of chicken soup, but not reduced fat sour cream since it separates during baking.  I also left out any additional salt and the taste was fine. It made a ton,  a 9x13 pan and a 7x11 pan.  I made my own bread crumbs with fresh french bread, parmesan, and italian seasonings.  It was so good and easy that I am making it again tonight for a school potluck featuring "Comfort Foods".  Thanks for a great recipe.

as written, 4 stars but w/tweaks, this is delish!  great for potlucks.  glad I read the reviews and omitted the butter, and only 2.5 # of potatoes.  I am sure they would have been too dry w/the 5#. eyeballed the ham, and used 1 bunch of green onions, no salt.  cut my potatoes into thin slices.  versatility w/the soup varieties...I used cream of chicken & mushroom(never knew they even made that combo).  couldn't find the parmesan crumbs so used plain crumbs w/shredded parmesan.  Only used melted butter to drizzle over the topping.  thanks for this recipe. very filling and a meal in itself.

I made this for my family last night using leftover ham from Christmas - everyone really enjoyed it although I did change recipe pretty dramatically. First, I sauteed, 1 medium onion, 1 medium carrot, 1 stalk celery and 2 lbs of potatoes in some olive oil. I then combined the soup, sour cream (about 3/4 cup), green onion, cheese, ham, salt & pepper. I added the vegetable mixture, put everything in a casserole dish and baked for 45 minutes after topping with a mixture of garlic, parmesan cheese and bread crumbs (and a drizzle of EVOO). The end result was really tasty, comforting food with a lot less calories given the omission of 1/2 cup of butter.

Yum! Comfort food at its best. I reduced the butter in the casserole itself in half. I used 3/4 cup breadcrumbs, 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese for the topping and it was delicious. 16 year old son ate a TON after football practice!

Not enough substance to it, seemed like something was missing. The butter on top made it too oily. Leftover's always get eaten in my house, won't be making this one again.

I added some garlic. My topping of bread crumbs didn't get cruchy liked I would have liked. Think I will use less next time. Maybe just a cup.

this is a delicious dish!
makes lots of leftovers, which is great.  don't forget to drain your cooked potatoes before you mash them.  I didn't one, and ended up with potato soup. still good, but not what I wanted.

Delicious! I followed a reviewer's advice and used half the amount of potatoes but the casserole ended up pretty runny and too buttery.  I will try it next time with the correct amount of potatoes.  Otherwise the flavor is excellent and would probably be just as good with half the butter called for in the recipe.  Only thing I added was some garlic powder.

I'm giving this two stars because I prepared it as written, and this recipe calls for far too many potatoes.  The overall flavor was really good, but I have to agree with other reviewers who suggested cutting the amount of potatoes by 2 lbs or so, and cutting them into smaller pieces.    Another complaint that I had was that the casserole did not "set up" well.  It was pretty runny.  I have a feeling it will be better the next day, which is fine by me because I love leftovers.  I may try it again, with fewer potatoes and more ham.

My family loved this!  Used the leftovers from our spiral ham to prepare this casserole.  Followed the directions of misskim's review & it came out beautifully.  Used Cream of Broccoli soup (that's what I had) & 2.5 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes.  Cooked in a metal 9X13 pan at a temp b/t 350 & 375 for 30 minutes.  Very good!

Good recipe that turned out as I expected. I did not use red potatoes (didn't have them) and only used half of the recommended amount (of potatoes). Kept sauce ingredients at 12-serving size and that made enough sauce for us--if I'd halved the sauce I think it would have been too dry. Warmed up leftovers were still tasty too!

Well-received by family and friend! Only slightly altered recipe: Used approx 3 1/2 lbs of red potatoes. Cubed into approx 1" pieces; par-boiled 8 mins. Also cubed ham steaks into small pieces - about 3 1/2 cups. Added more scallions (good 1/2 cup) and some chives. Skipped salt. Used Italian bread crumbs (enough to cover well), sprinkled Parm cheese on top with a little melted butter. I think that the flavor from the Italian bread crumbs makes big difference...Slight method change: I mixed the sour cream, soup, cheddar cheese, some melted butter, green onion, chives and pepper in large bowl. Since I sprayed baking pan with Pam, I put a layer of potatoes and ham right in the pan. I then folded remaining ham and potatoes into cheese mixure and then spooned evenly onto potatoes and ham already in baking dish. Sprinkled on plenty of bread crumbs to cover, sprinkled on parm cheese then drizzled a bit of butter. Cooked 350 1/2 hour and then covered lightly with foil and cooked additional 10 mins. YUMMY! Served with a side of steamed asparagus. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

So simple,so good. Jenny-O turkey-ham halfs were on sale so that's what i used.I made a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand, but I'm sure would have been great w/out....I used about 2.5 lbs all-purpose potatoes, cream-o-mushroom soup, and a small head of cauliflower (i steamed until tender)I had on hand for an added veggie serving. Came out great! Family loved it, I'll def make again

I reduced the portions, and used what I had in the house. And it works!  I used yukon potatoes, fat free sour cream, cream of mushroom soup, ricotta cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped ham, salt and pepper and topped with Italian flavored breadcrumbs w/ a few small pats of butter.  I loved this because the ingredients and portions are very flexible and it tastes great! When my husband likes it, I know this is a keeper. Thanks!

My teenage sons friends LOVE for me to make this recipe.  I add more ham (about 3-4 cups) and only about 3 pounds of potatoes.  When cooking the potatoes, set a timer for 12 minutes.  Makes them come out perfect when the dish is complete.  I use plain bread crumbs or this dish.  If you don't like cheese, this isn't the dish for you...two thumbs up! (would be more if I had more)

This dish was great!  I altered the recipe a little...I didn't use butter, I only used about half the sour cream(since hubby doesnt' like much) and I added about half a cup of half & half.  If you like green onions, I'd suggest to add more.   The whole family loved it!

SOOO good. It's a family favorite! I love that it's simple.  I don't even have to measure.  I just dump in the ingredients until it looks right.  I mix parmesan cheese in with the other ingredients and use italian bread crumbs on top.  I also use white onion. For leftovers:  Stir in scrambled eggs for breakfast!

Seriously? 5 lbs of potatoes in a 9x13 pan? NO WAY. I used 2.5 lbs and filled up TWO.  That said, this dish is wonderful. We froze the leftovers and can't wait to have it again.

This was really good.  It reminds me of a potato casserole that I make frequently from our Mennonite cookbook only this has ham in it and is slightly different.  I followed the recipe for the most part but cut my potatoes smaller and just watched them closely when boiling so they did not turn to mush.  I made my own parmesan flavored bread crumbs.  Everyone raved.  I will make this again.

Double the ham on this recipe!  

It's yummy!  You could use frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes to make it faster.

I've made this dish numerous times now and its come to be one of my favorite comfort foods. Its great exactly as written, but I usually modify it. Instead of the soup I'll just substitute milk or half and half, and I often leave out the green onions unless I happen to have them on hand. I even forgot to add the cheese once and it was still great.

11-17-09.  Homey, but good.  I usually don't try recipes with cream of ANYTHING soup in it because I don't want my food tasting like it came from a can.  This recipe is an exception. I couldn't detect the canned soup flavor at all.  It's a good way to use up leftover ham & a couple potatoes.  I mostly halved it using:  2 Idaho potatoes (cubed & boiled till just tender), 1/2c fatfree (with all the fat in the butter & cheese, it didn't separate) sour cream, 3T melted butter, all the soup, 1c cheese, 1/4t onion powder, 2c ham & not much crumbs & 1T melted butter.  I think if I used even half listed, it would be too much.  It is a dressed up sidedish, but it gets you out of making something new for a night!  8-7-11.  Boy, 14, had two servings.  VERY unusual.  I must have used more than two potatoes the first time.  Too much sauce this time, which I faked using chicken broth, a little milk & cornstarch.  Two parts breadcrumbs, one part parmesan cheese, one part melted margarine on top.

My daughter & I thought that this was good, my 11 yr. old son said that it tasted weird.  I doubled the ham & didn't use the butter, however I do think that it needed the butter to "crispen" up the bread crumb topping (that's why my son thought it was weird).  I will make this again, although next time I will add more cheese as well.  Thanks Terri!

A yummy recipe, not surprising considering what's in it.  It's easy to make and makes plenty.  It's a very flexible recipe that is well suited to substitution - a hard recipe to screw up.

Finally getting around to rating this! First made it in June 2011 and had added some rosemary at the time, and didn't care for that seasoning  choice. Made it again last night with some changes and it was a hit! Used 5-6 well-scrubbed red potatoes, cut into chunks (bite-sized, not diced). Used called-for cream of chicken soup, but I think any "cream of" soup would work well, according to your taste preference. Next time, I'd like to try it with Cheddar cheese soup and drastically reduce the shredded cheese. I seasoned the soup/sour cream mixture with garlic/onion powders, pepper, paprika, parsley, and a hint of Tony Chachere's. I added 1 c shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 1 c of Italian blend. I used a 16oz pkg of diced ham, which made it super easy. Omitted the green onion, as I didn't have it, but would probably add 1/2 a sauteed onion next time.  Eyeballed the amount of Italian breadcrumbs (next time I'll use crushed up croutons for more flavor) and just a couple tablespoons of melted butter drizzled on top. Overall, a good, comforting dish that will definitely be made again in this house!

Oh my goodness, this was amazing!! My daughter and I were still sneaking bites as we cleared the table. 
I used about 3 pounds of potatoes, cutting them into large bites before boiling. I used sour cream with chives and left out the green onion. Instead of the bread crumbs, I crumbled butter crackers (Club) over the top and sprinkled with a little Parmesan. 
This was so easy and will be a new family favorite!!

Good comfort food recipe and great if you have a lot of leftover ham and need something to do with it.  Might add more cheese to it next time.

I made this a 2nd time using leftover baked russet potatoes that I cut up and then let it all come together in the crock pot on low for 6 hours. For the breadcrumb topping, I melted the butter in a pan on the stove, then added the breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese, toasted it for a bit and then added to the crock pot for the last 1.5 hours of cook time.  It came out better than the first time I made it.  Will be making in the crock pot every time going forward.

These were very good though next time I think I will use cream of potato soup instead of chicken.  I think this will blend better.

I'm afraid I can't give this recipe a full 5 stars. Wayyyy too much butter. But having made my modified version at least dozens of times now, I'm just here to give you more ideas. I skip all the butter, bread crumbs and cream-of-whatever soup. I add chicken stock if I need more liquid. I try to use all 3-Cheddar, Mozza and Jack. Add 2 or 3 tsp of your favorite spice. We like Greek Seasoning or Essence of Emeril. I've made with ham, bacon or sausage and we like all versions. This time, I very finely chopped a head of broccoli (no stalks) and added along with sliced black olives and cooked, sliced pork sausage. All the broccoli-haters were almost finished eating before anyone even noticed! They thought they were chives, which I had liberally sprinkled on top of the dish before serving. (It helped that they were eating while watching a playoff hockey game.) I've added finely shredded carrots, green peas or cooked, chopped spaghetti squash on occasion. Never one complaint! :)

this was great! however, i used regualr bakers potatoes and the cook time was off. i boiled them for about 20 min then baked everything for 30 min but got crunchy, raw, uncooked potatoes. i put the bake back in the oven for another hour, so it got a total of 1.5 hrs of oven time.

As written, I would almost give this 3 stars.  I omitted the additional bread crumbs and 1/4 cup butter at the end and even then my family all thought that this was too rich.  That said, I did enjoy this and think it would be great with a little less butter in the base and a few more potatoes.  I think taking the base with less butter, and less the breadcrumbs and add'l 1/4 cup butter, would be really great paired with scrambled eggs cooked separately.  I'll definitely retain this recipe as a base.  Yum!

As is, it's a good recipe; we both liked it.  Husband and I thought it would be better if the potatoes were in smaller pieces, there was more ham, and a little more sauce (although maybe the sauce would be enough if potatoes are in smaller pieces). I used reduced fat sour cream and soup to cut the fat and calories, but otherwise made as written. I will try again, as it's a great way to use up leftover ham.

This was fabulous. I took others advice and only used 2.5 lbs of potatoes. I also used less butter, fat free cream of chix soup and reduced fat sour cream. My five year old came back for seconds

Made this tonight for dinner.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup the low sodium kind as well as fat free sour cream.  I used probably 3-4 cups of ham.  I didn't boil the potatoes that long so I needed to bake the dish a little longer.  I think however you adjust this recipe it will come out delicious.  We loved it and it was perfect.

Alright, so this turned out better than I thought it would. Even though I didn't have everything, I made do and it was SUPER delicious nevertheless. The changes I had were: Yukon Gold potato's, Cream of mushroom soup, and Progresso's Herb-Garlic bread crumbs!  The ham and potato come together perfectly!!   I loved this recipe! Super easy, Super fast, and Super tasty!!

I have made this dish many times.  Our family loves potatoes, so we use this as a main dish.  I follow the recipe except for cutting down on the butter.  If I have extra ham, I will use that as well, since hubby usually likes more ham and less potatoes.  Great dish!

This was really tasty! I only had a few small changes.  I left the green onions out and substituted Cream of Mushroom for the Cream of Chicken soup because of personal taste, and I used shredded Mild Cheddar+Monterey Jack cheese instead of just Cheddar.  Did NOT add salt, but doubled the amount of chopped ham. I didn't have parmesan bread crumbs, so I made my own (following another reviewer's suggestion) by taking regular bread crumbs and mixing them with parmesan cheese and garlic salt. Turned out great!  I watched my potatoes VERY carefully so that they were not overcooked when boiling, but in the end it took around 60 minutes in the oven to get them soft but not mushy or too crisp. I'm at around 5000' in altitude, and anything that goes in the oven can wildly vary on cooking time so this wasn't unexpected.

This receipe is very tasty!  I made a few changes like some of the other reviewers did.  I used two cans of crm of mushroom soup, cut the amt. of potatoes to 2 1/2 lbs and added more ham than what was called for.  The sauce is very good and plenty of it.  Next time I make it I think I will cut the potatoes in chunks rather than quarter them.  I didn't cook them first, just threw everything all together and it turned out perfect. Also, instead of using green onions, I think using a red or white onion would give it a little more flavor. This is definately a keeper.  The whole family loved it!

This was good, but SALTY! We had 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and now wish I had tried the lower sodium variety instead. Maybe leaving out the butter in the base would be good since mine wasn't salt-free and the sauce seemed a bit greasy. We used regular potatoes and Panko bread crumbs with no butter for the topping. We will try this again, though, and thanks for the recipe.

Well, I don't know if I did something wrong or what but 5 lbs of potatoes were overflowing my 9x13 pan!  So I improvised.  I had decided to use chicken as another reviewer suggested.  So I took my chicken, sour cream, and cream of chicken soup and combined.  I then took the melted butter and mashed my potatoes adding milk to reach proper consistency.  Ended up tasting very yummy, just was more work than I had anticipated....

This was an great recipe & very filing. Makes a lot; I have a family of five and there were plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. Had a much better flavor the following day I thought.  I made a few changes after reading other suggestins.  I used about 3.5 lbs of potatoes, can of cream of celery & chicken.  I cubed the potatoes so they were bite size boiled for 10-12 min. As suggested in another review I heated butter, sour cream, cheese and soups in sauce pan prior to pouring over potatoes. In addition I also added minced garlic to taste, 1.5 C parmeson cheese with the soup mixture. I also added additional ham (needed with all the potatoes if you like ham & the flavor it adds) & mixed vegetables.  I would recommend this recipe. you can add so much to the original recipe and it is perfect for a cold winter night for a stick to the ribs meal.My husband said it was perfect after working outside all day.

I was very excited about trying this dish, but it ended up not caring for it at all.  It just didn't turn out the way I expected it to.  My potatoes were "mushy", but that could be because I overcooked them before mixing with the other ingredients (?).  When I mixed the potatoes with the ham, cheese, etc., the skins started peeling and the potatoes turned into "mashed" potatoes (is it supposed to be this way???).  I didn't think this casserole had a lot of flavor either, even though I used cubed smoked ham (but I did use mostly non-fat ingredients which could have affected the taste).  I will continue to look for another similar recipe (because I like the idea), but won't try this particular one again.  Sorry!

I made these for a large group of people and everyone could not stop talking about them!!! I did not use any butter and I couldnt see how it could have made them taste better- they were incredible without it. I also didnt use green onions as I dont like them cooked.
Definate keeper!!!

I made with shredded chicken instead and cut the butter from 3/4 cup to 1/4--fabulous!  It's warm, hearty and delicious.  Great for a crowd.

Great comfort food.  I left out the 1/2 cup of butter, and used non-fat sour cream,  98% fat-free cream of chicken soup, 2% fat shredded cheese, and spritzed the breadcrumbs with PAM spray instead of butter/margarine to lower the fat content.  I also added two teaspoons of red pepper flakes for a little more spice.  You will need two 9 x 13 baking dishes to make the amount created by the recipe--this made about five meals for both my husband and me!  I calculated the WW points:  9 points per serving.

I made this recipe last night for dinner.  It had a good flavor but my husband and I both thought it was more of a side dish than a complete meal.  I played with the recipe some too, adding more ham, more sour cream, more soup to make it creamier.  I think the potatoes would be even better mashed too.  Overall it was pretty good but it felt like we were missing something eating just this for dinner.      
We're having steaks tonight; it should be great warmed up with it!

Very good recipe, even better heated up for
lunch the next day.  Next time, I will peel
the potatoes because I'm not too crazy about
the skin.

Definitely going to making this one again.  I cut the recipe in half, planning to freeze the leftovers.  The hubby brought home a guinea pig, I mean guest for dinner and there was hardly enough left over for my lunch the next day.  Oh, and because I had a time crunch, I did the whole thing in the slow cooker.  A great, hardy meal ready when we were.

This is so so good.  My husband asked for this to be put into regular rotation.  I did follow other reviewers and used about 3 pounds of red potatoes, and about 3 cups of ham, and baked in a metal pan.

Made a couple changes based on reviews, doubled the ham & less potatoes.  Not really impressed.  there was too much sauce left over on the plate.  I'd rather just make my hashbrown casserole & serve ham on the side.

Love this dish!!  It's the perfect comfort food for a rainy, cold, day. The only thing I did differently was use 1 cup of smoked cheddar cheese and 1 cup of sharp cheddar.  My family really enjoyed this but it's not very low in fat.  Next time I make it I'll use 2% cheese and reduced fat sour cream and see if we enjoy it as much.

Great way to use left over ham. I only had 3 lbs potatoes and used cream of mushroom soup b/c I don't like cream of chicken. Otherwise I did it all the same. I will use the recipe again

Yummy and a real crowd pleaser! I did tweak this as others suggested. Used only 8 oz sour cream, cut potatoes & butter in half to cut fat, and used yellow onion only b/c had no green onion on hand. Sprayed the breadcrumbs w/Pam instead of butter. Made a second 9x13 using celery soup+8oz sour cream and just as good. I don't think I will add butter next time, it didn't need it. Great dish for a potluck, thanks for sharing!

very good. I did what everyone else recommended-less potatoes, more soup and ham, added lots of cheddar cheese. It definitely took longer to cook than the recipe states though!

This was a pretty good dish. For someone just beginning to live on her own I love finding dishes that are cheap, easy and last for several meals. I played around with this recipe a bit but tried to stay true to the recipe posted. I chose to not cook my potatoes ahead of time, and instead chopped them into medium-small pieces. I cut the potatoes up and put them in the pan until I saw there was enough. I ended up using 3-4 lbs of potatoes. I used a small container of sour cream (about 1 cup) and two cans of cream of chicken. I also added a splash of milk to add up the difference. Instead of bread crumbs I used shake and bake italian seasoning and sprinkled garlic powder and parmesean cheese on top. It took longer to cook about 1 hr and 1/2 and I cooked it at 400 covered until the last half hour. I also took a suggestion from another reviewer to layer the potatoes with cheese and bread crumb. Very good recipes, I will definitly make this again.

If you don't cook the potatoes before hand, be prepared to cook it longer in the oven. I did it 30 minutes at 350, and they were not done at all, so I cooked it an additional 30 minutes at 400, then they were done. I also added an additional can of soup, doubled the ham, and only did 2.5 lbs of potatoes, which filled up my casserole dish. My husband LOVED it. This makes great leftovers too.

I followed the lead of several others and boosted the amount of ham but kept the potatoes the same.  (I used a smoked ham but next time I'm using a honey baked instead.)  Low on sour cream - I had less than a third of what was called for, I filled out that part of the recipe with ranch dressing.  I spooned half the mixture across the bottom of the baking pan, covered that with an extra cup of Monterrey Jack cheese blend and topped that with a mixture of bread crumbs and a tablespoon of Tony Cacheras Cajun seasoning.  Then I spooned the rest of the mixture over the top, laid down some more Parmesan over that, drizzled the melted butter and finally topped it off with some crushed (not pulverized) Durkee French fried onions.  Heavenly doesn't begin to describe it.

These were fine, 5# potatoes and 2 cans of soup. I prefer a more milder taste than that of adding the soups.

Yum! Definitely creamy comfort food!  didn't have green onions so subst. yellow onions.  Added 1/2 cup extra ham.  Delicious!  Served with broccoli on the side and also cantelope.  Hearty enough for a main dish.

This was sooo good I couldn't stop eating it. I used frozen country style hash browns (thawed), to save on prep time. And cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken because I personally like it better. I baked it for a little over an hour and it came out perfect. They were absolutely "heavenly"!

Very good - my family loved it. I did follow the device of those who went before me. I have a large family, so i doubled the recipe, sauted 1 1/2 yellow onions and added at the mixing stage. I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken, and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. It turned out great!

I have a recipe thats almost identical, only using shredded hash browns,which I prefer.For some reson the large potato chunks just didn't do it for us. The taste was good, we just like the hash browns better..

This dish has excellent flavor, but as other reviewers mention, it does need more ham.  Also, I had trouble getting the potatoes cooked all the way through.  Next time I think I will use regular Idaho potatoes and slice them in thin slices rather than cubes.  Overall, very good - real comfort food!

We liked this dish a lot but did not think it was heavenly. I used 4lbs. of potaoes a little smaller than quartered. Cut back just a bit on the butter and upped the ham by an extra cup. I also added a sprinkle of onion powder to the mix for our taste. I will make this again and what I like about it is that for the first meal it can be the main entree and then used as a side the next day because the ham is not overwhelming. Thanks for the good recipe.

This was a fabulous dinner !!!  Great comfort food !!! I made this exactly like the recipe was written as I do all recipes that I review.  However, when I make it the second time I sometimes change things.  The next time I make this I will cut the potatoes in slices rather then cube, I will dice the ham a little smaller, and most definatley add more sour cream on top when I serve the dish. The whole family ate this right up, there was not a drop left for lunch the next day !!!  Can't wait to make this again !!!!

i've made this twice now.   Family didn't love it as much as me the first time and I left the bread crumbs off both times.   The second time didn't log on and realized I had made before.  I followed directions exactly and the par boil time is way off and didn't test anything since I was home making it at lunch.  I still thought the recipes was good and hubby said it was fixable again, but alterations needed as the first time.    Great possibilities but be a cook and test as you go.

Best potatoe dish. Keeps well and I reheat some in the micro wave for dinner. I added more green onions and it doesn't need the ham if not available.

This recipe is way too high in far for the taste.  I would decrease the amount of potatoes to 4 pounds.  And use lowfat cheese and sour creme.  It isn't as good as it should be for the amount of ingredients.  I would also another cup of ham. I probably wouldn't make this again.

Excellent tase, but there is no way on earth that 5 pounds of potatoes are fitting in a 9x13 pan. I had to cut it to 2-1/2 pounds and sue the same ingredients on everything else. Maybe I'm missing something.  Oh, and I used honey glazed ham which gave it a nice pop with the taste!

My whole family loved this.  I had tried another ham and potato casserole recipe, but they didn't like the onions.  I left out the green onions and the bread crumbs and they ate this up, even my picky 6 year old.  Will definitely using this one again.

Made this very close to the recipe, except used chopped white onion instead of green onion (b/c that's what I had on hand).  It was OK.  Nothing that blew my family away.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but probably won't make again.

This recipe is an absolute disaster if you make it as written. First, 5 lb of potatoes, 2 cups of this and 2 of that, all in a 9x13 baking dish?? Not so. Then, after 30 min the potatoes were raw and needed another 30 for thorough cooking. With these modifications (plus skipping the butter altogether), it was yummy.

Heavenly is right!  The only problem I had was that this recipe made way too much for my husband and me.  However, this would be the perfect dish for a potluck dinner.  I want to try to make this again using shredded hash browns instead of quartered potatoes.  So good!

This dish was amazing.  Like others, I used 4 cups of ham and cut the potatoes to 2 1/2 pounds.  My whole family loved it and told me I have to make it again!  It was the perfect dish to use up leftover ham after a holiday.

I am not one for measuring and following directions very well and this turned out wonderful!  We had some left over ham from Easter that I wanted to use up and not have it taste like what we have eaten for the last two days.  I followed others ideas and used less potatoes and more ham.  I didn't have a whole container of sour cream so I added a little milk.  Also didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I filled in with  mozzarella.  It filled up the family with plenty left over.  Overall a wonderful recipe that we will use again and again.

VERY SALTY!  I did not add any salt and omitted all the butter but again, it was too salty.  I used fat free cream of mushroom soup (that's what I had on hand) and next time I would use low sodium soup.  I used really rich cheddar cheese which I'm sure had something to do with the saltiness.

This was so wonderful. Rich and creamy. I cut the recipe in half and made in an 8x8 dish. Used a little more sour cream than called for in the recipe and topped with seasoned dry stuffing crumbs instead of bread. This is definitely company worthy and would definitely make again.

Very good. As others noted, 5 pounds of potatoes was too much-it barely fit.  Very tasty though but awfully fattening-but I loved it.

This recipe wasn't bad but please don't add salt. I didn't add salt and it was still too salty. The combination of ham and cream soup is very salty. After reading reviews, i opted to leave out the butter altogether. If i was to make it again, i would leave the butter out of the casserole but add a little to the bread crumbs. This is a very rich dish, even without the butter and with using low fat sour cream.

This is absolutely delicious.  The ultimate comfort food.  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of diced onions and only 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs mixed with parmesan.  I also used an 11x13 pan and it was filled.  Highly recommend for a cold Fall or Winter night.  Connie M.

This was fabulous!  I made no changes except that I used white potatoes instead of red, and didn't bother to drizzle butter on top before baking.  It is true that the full recipe wouldn't fit into my 13 x 9 pan, so I used a small roaster pan instead, and that worked out great.  I'll certainly make this again!

Wow, this is really good.  I left out the butter; I think it would make it too rich and oily, and I didn't put any breadcrumbs on top.  I baked mine in a covered casserole dish for about an hour.  Delicious, will be making this often.

Very yummy! I think I might use a tad less cheese next time it was a bit strong! And I'll skip the breadcrumbs they make no difference. Also only used half the amount of potatoes like other people.

ok this was so good!!  If I wasn't trying to watch my intake, I'd eat the whole pan today.  I did try to buff up the veggies in this dish I added green peppers, onion and mushrooms.  I don't think there is a wrong way to do this dish.

This recipe is awesome. Very creamy and delicious. I have made it many times and added 1-2 tsp. of mustard and omitted the bread crumbs and butter on the top. I have also layed boneless pork chops on the top while baking instead adding chopped ham and added some broccoli florets. My kids love it!!

Good, but the proportions are way off for a main dish. Two cups of ham for twelve servings? I used mushroom instead of chicken soup, half as many potatoes, and twice as much ham.

I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover holiday ham and this one was right up my alley. i used regular potatoes for convenience. i did not have bread crumbs so i crushed a package of stove-top cornbread stuffing and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese to it for the topping. i also added a small can of diced green chilis for extra flavor. it turned out wonderful!

This was an excellent recipe.  Our family loved this.  I first barely melted the butter, added the whole can of soup, added some milk because of adding a whole bag of steamed broccoli, 2 whole green onions, and a whole lot more ham.  I didn't use the bread crumbs or Parmesan.   I baked a little longer.  It was an excellent meal with the broccoli added.  Recommend to anyone.

I noted the changes that other's mentioned in their reviews and used the cream of celery soup and halved the potatoes. The only thing is that I should have used a bit more ham. I cut the potatoes in scallops and only cooked them until they were just tender so they would hold up to the stirring. It was great! Only four stars because I had to make the above mentioned changes.

This was an ok recipe. It was very heavy. I mixed the sour cream, butter, soup and cheese together in a sauce pan on the stove before mixing it with ham and potatos because a few other reviewers mentioned that the ingredients didn't come together, and I had no similar problem. Definatly not a low fat dish, I'm not sure if I'll make this again or not. Since no one ate the left overs, and half of it ended up in the trash, probably not.

YUMMY!!!  I thought this was delicious..my entire family did!!  It is like a loaded Baked potato.  I didn't change a thing, though I didn't have any green onions, so I just used regular onions and it tasted just fine.  This one is definately a keeper and thanks sooo much for sharing :>)

This recipe is the greatest!  It's delicious, and quite filling, not to mention that it's pretty simple to put together.  I've come back to re-print it after having misplaced my original recipe.  EVERYONE who has tried it, has loved it!  I have a 4 and 8 year old, and they simply love it too!

I followed a prev reviewers advice and used cream of celery...I would highly recommend that substitution.  also agree that it makes a TON, wished I had sliced the potatoes instead of quartering, but very good recipe.  will make again.

Delicious casserole for those snowy winter nights! Not a diet dish, but eliminate the salt and use low-sodium soup, double the ham and you have a winner! A little dry mustard is good in this also. Thanks, Terri!

Excellent!   I am not a big potatoe eater - I used 1/2 of the total potatoes and added more ham.

Wow, this was a big hit in my house.  I used petite red potatoes and only added 4lbs.  Also, added some cilnatro for extra flavor, my family loved it.

Perfect recipe for moms with no time to cook! So easy and so good. My family loved it! Be sure to serve with hot buttered biscuts for the perfect fall or winter dinner! PS - great for freezing for lunches!

Made this  a few months back and everyone loved it. Men and other picky eaters love it.  I add a healthy sprinkling of Tony Cacharere's seasoning (on the spice aisle) to zip it up and cook the potatoes before I bake it.  Absolutely wonderful and easy!!!

Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I halved the amount of potatoes, doubled the ham, and used about 2.5 cups of cheese.  I used light sour cream, omitted the bread crumbs, butter, and salt. I had yukon gold potatoes, so we went with them.  I did not peel them as we like the skin and I sliced them before boiling We liked it very much and have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  This would make a great dish for a potluck dinner too.

A little too much potatoes and too little ham.  Also, I did not get a real taste of cheese.  Changing the ratios of potato/ham/cheese might make this a tastier dish (I'll probably try that.)

I thought this recipe was really easy.  I think the potato quantity could be reduced a little, and the ham increased.  My family of 5 at the whole thing in one sitting.

This recipe was great and full of flavor.  I had the benefit of reading the reviews first so I made it with 4 pounds of potatoes which I peeled and sliced.  It would also be good as a side dish without the ham.  Next time I will probably mix the breadcrumbs with the butter and then sprinkle on top as oppossed to drizzling the butter.  I'll make this dish again!

Will definately cut down on the amount of potatoes next time.  Not only was 5 lbs. hard to fit in a 9x13, but the flavor of dish would be better with less as well.  Would also increase the amount of ham.  Otherwise good.

Delicious! I used garlic and herb seasoned dry bread crumbs and I cubed the potatoes rather than quartered them but no matter "how you slice em", this recipe is a WINNER. My family enjoyed this dish and I will make it again.

Thank you so very much for this recipe. I too made a lighter, less-salt version with cream of mushroom soup. Spectacular tasting! The true testament to your recipe is that it easily allowed me to alter to taste, and still yielded a wonderful dish. To me one of the secret ingredients is the scallion, which imparts such a singular flavor to every dish it's in. This recipe is a keeper. Can't wait until my husband gets home from class tonight so he can have some.

This recipe was delicious. I followed the recipe almost exact, only I made these variations to fit my own palate: I read other posts and used 2 & 1/2 lbs red potatos. I cut them much larger than diced, and boiled them for 3 to 4 minutes. 12 minutes would have mashed them. I also used sharp chedder, and 3/4 of the container of sour cream, but the whole 16 oz container would have been ok, i thought it would have been too much and i thought of the calories :) Also used "Contadina brand Italian bread crumbs" instead of the parmesan. And used almost 3&1/2 cups ham. I will definately make this again the next time I have a left over holiday ham. Delicious!!!

This is very good. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and used seasoned bread crumbs to which I added parmesan cheese. I think next time I will use plain bread crumbs and no parmesan as the topping was the only complaint.  They loved the "filling" though. Thank-you for a very good and easy recipe.

I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the potatoes in a large dice and didn't cook them first.  I even used a metal pan.  This was a mistake!  The potatoes didn't get tender!  Next time I will cut the potatoes in a VERY small dice so I don't have to cook them first.  Otherwise, great recipe. But the extra butter in the casserole is not needed.

This recipe is awesome.  I used mini red potatoes and sliced them into sixths.  I also substituted some of the sour cream for french onion dip and excluded the onion.  I omitted the salt.  It was a huge hit for everyone.  I would definately recommend this recipe....  Quick, easy, and delicious.

Made as described but with slightly more ham. Huge amount of food! Agree with someone's previous comment that it was like a baked potatoe.  Next time I'll add more cheese and more soup.

This was actually very good, but I did make some some changes. First, I halfed the recipe because 5 lbs of potatoes was way too much. Then I substituted a whole small onion since I didn't have any green onions. Added garlic. Used the whole can of cream of chicken soup. Used turkey kielbasa because I had no ham. And used Italian style bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese and it came out wonderful. My picky son never likes anything and he had 2 big plates full.Thanks for the recipe, it will be used again, I'm sure.

This was really good, but it does need more ham and less potatoes.  I didn't have the parm bread crumbs or any bread crumbs for that matter.  I just put some sliced bread in my food processor to make some crumbs and mixed those with the butter.  I would definately make this again with more ham.

i agree with prior comments about it being too many potatoes and not enough ham. we had some leftover ham from christmas dinner and had gotten a mini chopper as a gift. one thing led to another and the ham was in very, very tiny peices. so i found this recipe with chopped ham and got the ingredients. i know that i didn't let the potatoes cook long enough but if there had been less they would have been perfect. i also forgot to season as i was preparing (was too busy gawking at the mess i had made). i did add extra ham since mine was in such tiny pieces, and after coming out of the oven it doesn't taste too bad. i think i will take the other reviewers suggestions next time though.

A friend shared some of her left over holiday ham with me so I used it in this recipe.  My husband and I loved it just the way it's written.

Well we just finished eating and this recipe was a big hit with my family. I have 2 kids ages 7 and 5 and they both loved it! I LOVED the taste and will be making this again soon! Next time though, I may cut back slightly on the sour cream and the cream of chicken as it was a little runnier than I prefer. I also followed someone's advice on here and cut the amount of potatoes in half, after putting it all in the pan I couldn't imagine using double that amount!

This was very tasty.  The only change I made was I used French Fried Onions on top in place of the breadcrumbs.

Expected this recipe to be more than it was...just very basic I guess, and overflowing with potatoes. Just about anything would've made this more interesting, and I probably should've gone with my gut and thrown in some broccoli or something.

This was delicious.  Next time I make it, I will use shredded potatoes.  I halved the recipe for me and my hubby, and it still would have fed 4-6 more people!!

I also followed other reviewer's advice & halfed the amount of potatoes & increased the ham. It came out so delicious! I didn't have the Parmesan cheese bread crumbs so I just crumbled some buttery round crackers on top. I agree with others & I don't think that the topping is needed. This dish is delicious & you have room to play with it & add add'l ingredients to your liking. Great recipe!

This was very tasty!  We had it as a meal one night and a side dish the next.  I did cut back on the potatoes and added more ham.  I think there would have been WAY too many potatoes if I hadn't.  I also used 1/2 a can of crm of mushroom and 1/2 a can of crm of chicken.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand so I just went without.  Next time I will try it with, but either way this was delicious.  I also used a 1/3 C. of yellow onion b/c my hubby hates green onions. I will make this anytime I have leftover ham!  Thanks!

Just used the base idea and went with whatever I had and it was MARVELOUS! (I'm usually not big on potatoes, but the fam ALWAYS is...) I used about 1/3 bag of Cubed hash browns, about 1/3 of a 16 oz light sour cream container, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 can FF Cream Mushroom, Cheeses:  Cheddar, Mozzarella, and Parmesan - didn't measure. A couple spoons of minced garlic, a handful of chopped frozen broccoli, 2 small green onions, just under a cup of ham, and topped it with about 1/4 bag of Tater Tot Crowns, a bit more parmesan and another 1/4 cup melted butter.  Husband went ape for these and right now is on his THIRD heaping helping.

Used baking potatoes and halved the recipe and it ended up being dry (did I do something wrong?).  Added the other half of can of soup and an additional cup of water to the reheated portion and it was much creamier...almost like soup.

Very good, but also very rich like mentioned on other reviews.  I used half the potatoes and doubled the ham (a must).  I only used 6 Tbsp. of butter, which I briefly used to saute 1 clove of minced garlic and the scallions, before adding the sour cream, soup and shredded cheese like suggested by others.  I cut the potatoes in chunks slightly larger than bit size and had no problem cooking them until slightly tender so that they could be mixed together with the ham and soup mixture without breaking apart while mixing.  The final 30 min. in the oven was just enough and the potatoes were perfect. I used a cup of crushed garlic and cheese croutons and sprinkled on top without the extra butter.  Everyone loved it!  But...it was RICH!  One of those receipes that is great the first several bites, but by the end it's too rich (for me anyway).  It had a great texture and turned out very creamy.  I think next time, in order to cut back on the rich taste, I'm going to use 4 Tbsp. butter, perhaps 1-1/2 cups shredded cheese instead of 2, and add 1/2 c. milk or light cream to thin it out just a little.  My husband and 12 year old son finished the leftovers the next day, which was unexpected, and they call it a keeper just the way it was.

Great flavor, very filling. Doubled the amount of ham and followed another reviewer's suggestion to heat butter, sour cream, cheese and soups in sauce pan before pouring over potatoes. Not sure it would be as easy to mix together if you didn't do this. Would definitely make again!

I made this for my family this weekend and it was a big hit! Even my hubbie (the picky eater) thought it was fabulous.  I made it just the way the recipe stated to except I made it with 3 cups of reduced sodium ham.  It was yummie, definately a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

This was excellent. My husband and his brother are the pickiest eaters and they loved it. I added a little more soup just to make it creamier and cheese on the top.

Creamy, cheesey, delcious! Very fattening, for sure!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3 lbs of potatoes and more ham(no extra salt needed).  I also used cream of celery soup, and a little garlic.  It also seemed like a whole lotta butter.  I think I will cut back on that next time.  Also, I added milk as another reviwer suggested, but I think that made it too soupy.  Will omit that next time.  I like it thick & creamy!

This recipe is yummy!  It is a great way to use up leftover ham.  I made a few adjustments based on other reviews.  I used leftover honey baked spiral ham cut into pieces and doubled the amount.  I used cream of celery soup, added garlic powder and parsley.  I only used about 3 pounds of potatoes...5 would have been way too many.  I did not have enough sour cream so I made up the difference with cream cheese.  It was about 50/50.  I omitted the salt and am glad I did.  I also added about a cup of milk to make the mixture a little smoother.  I put everything together except the potatoes which I only cooked until slightly soft.  I then mixed those in. Everyone loved it.  We ate it as a main dish with broccoli on the side.  Delicious!  I will definitely make again...maybe next time with chicken.

The reviews for this were pretty good, so I must have done something wrong.  Then again, I have never made a potato casserole nor have I ever eaten one.  The potatoes were meally and the ingredients never came together, everything seperated. This will be going in my "Oh well" pile.

This was good. I scaled the recipe to half and used a full can of soup and just added more ham. It filled a 9x13 pan really full. I cut the potatoes a little smaller. I found it to be a bit on the salty side even though I didn't add any salt. I used Ritz crackers mixed w/ melted butter for the topping. Was even better as leftovers even though the topping was mushy. Will make again.

Very yummy.  I made a few modifications...used Butter Buds instead of butter, dried minced onion instead of green onions, fat free sour cream, only 3.5-4 lbs potatoes, and 4 cups ham.  Oh, and italian breadcrumbs with some parmesan cheese mixed in.  I thought it was extremely tasty, a good comfort food.  Makes a LOT!

so good, made this with not quite the 5lbs of potatoes and more than 2 cups of ham.  my husband and I ate this everyday until it was gone...too much goodness to throw away any leftovers.
this is a must have anytime you have leftover ham.

This was a great recipe, just like eating a baked potatoe. The ham was a bit boring, would have been better with honey baked ham or maybe some bacon bits for flavor? Makes lots of left overs.

This was sooo good!  I took the advice of some other reviews and altered the recipe a little though.  Five lbs. of potatoes would have been WAY too much, I used about 3 1/2 lbs.  I also used less butter than called for, about 1/3 cup. Next time I also think I'll use more ham, about 3 cups instead of 2.  Since I forgot to get a green onion, I used a sweet onion I had in my fridge and diced it ut.  To cut down on the fat content I used lowfat soup and lowfat sour cream, which I don't think changed the taste.  It was really good though, everyone in my house liked it a lot!!!!  This is a new favorite.

I followed other reviewers' advice and added more ham to this recipe.  The ham I used was actually left-over from a spiral sliced ham I had cooked a few days earlier, I just chopped it up.  My family agreed that dish was heavenly, and it made good use of left overs that otherwise may have gone to waste. Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't figure out why everyone was saying this was a dressed up side dish.  That was until I read the recipe.  These are the potatoes EVERYONE has at potluck and family dinners.  If you change the ingredients around like this, it is so much better!
2 tbsp butter
1 can cream of CELERY (potatoes taste so much better!)
15 oz milk
1/4 cup diced onion
1 1/2 cups crushed cornflakes

On step 3 instead:  Saute onions in butter until translucent, and the other ingredients with the exception of melted butter, cheddar cheese and cornflakes.  Mix the butter with the cornflakes.  The last 10 or so minutes of baking sprinkle on the cheese followed by the cornflakes.

Tastes like an improved version of scalloped potatoes.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I halved the amount of potatoes and cut them into slices, and still they barely fit into the dish.  In fact, I had to put a cookie sheet on the bottom rack to catch all of the spilling.  After removing from the oven I had a small puddle of butter laying there on the cookie sheet and still, the potatoes were swimming in butter, even after halving the butter.  I will definitly cut down on the butter next time.  I was afraid of the potatoes getting mushy so I put the potatoes in raw and cooked for about 1 1/2 hours, like my regular scalloped potatoes, and they came out perfect.  Also, I used regular breadcrumbs and parmesan/romano cheese.  I didn't really notice the cheese much, perhaps should have used more as others recommended.  The hardest part for me, was stirring the mixture, but well worth the work.  My new favorite leftover ham recipe!

I think it is a great recipe, but I found it is better if the potatoes are cut up into smaller chunks  you use more ham than the recipe calls for. Other than that it is awsome!!

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!! made this tonight for dinner. loved the ingredients and decided to make it. My husband said this is a keeper. I will now make this instead of the old scalloped ham and potatoes!!!!!!!!! the only thing i would omit is the salt. Ham is salty enough.

I substituted cream cheese (8 oz) for the sour cream and the result was the creamiest potatoes and ham dinner I have ever had!  What a wonderful change from the white sauce kind, this is my family's new favorite recipe for scalloped potatoes and ham, Thanks for submitting!

I tried this recipe last night I was disapointed. It was a warm potato salad not a meal this was more of a side dish then anything else. I will not make this again.

This recipe is great because all of the ingredients are delicious.  However, the proportions are off.  It needs more ham, less potatoes and no extra salt.  I slice the potatoes instead of quartering.  Also, once I didn't have enough sour cream and supplemented with french onion dip.  It was awesome.  Also, if you are out of bread crumbs, finely crushed Ritz crackers with butter drizzled on top are a fine substitute.  In fact, I prefer it.

This was lovely once I changed a few things. Used about half the amount of sour cream, added about 1/4 c milk, used regular potatoes, only 3 tbsps butter, subbed in some sauteed yellow onion for the green onions, left out the bread crumbs since the husband HATES them :p, and omitted the salt. Had to cook for much longer since the potatoes weren't close to being done. I'd say I cooked it for about an hour altogether. Overall, I give it a 4, since husband said 'I love the ham! But the potatoes leave a little to be desired'

Never happy, that one.

Way too rich and unhealthy with so much fat and salt, but a delightful blend of flavors. I used fat-free soup and sour cream, only unsalted butter for the drizzle over bread crumbs (it does not need any butter at all - use extra soup mixed with skim milk for moisture). Five lbs. of potatoes didn't fit into the dish size given, but did nicely in a disposable roasting pan. Directions were oversimplified, so I creamed the soup, sour cream and WHITE pepper (needs NO additional salt, for sure), added a few tablespoons of skim milk to a half can extra cream of potato soup, then added the chunky ingredients. I poured all OVER the potatoes and stirred slightly. This was much easier. Boiled potatoes only 8 minutes to get a nice firm result. Too many leftovers, though, because you can't eat this but once every month.

This recipe was really good. I used white potatoes. They mashed up a bit when combined with the other ingredients but that was fine. Very creamy and dellicious. I left out the salt. I will try this next time and add some veggies right in with the casserole. I think corn would be awesome in this.

Excellent!  I omitted the salt and onion.  The hubby said it needed salt and onion!  The kids liked it, I liked it and the hubby liked it.  Everyone added salt but the ham I used wasn't very salty.

I use this recipe as a side dish, leaving out the ham and onions.  When made this way it is similar to party potatoes or company potatoes but instead of hashbrowns it has big pieces of delicious red potatoes!  For health reasons I don't always use the entire 1/2 cup of butter on the top and it still turns out great.  I make my own bread crumbs and add parmesan cheese to save on the expense.  My family loves this recipe and it is great to make for company or potlucks because you can make it up ahead of time and refrigerate until you are ready to bake it!  Freezes wonderfully too!

Wow this was great!  My family truly enjoyed this.  I did not have any red potatoes on hand so I used some russets and it turned out just wonderful.  I also didnt have any parmesean flavor breadcrumbs, so i used plain breadcrumbs and tossed in some fresh grated parmesean cheese and it had a super flavor.  Thank you Terri for sharing this, I will be making this one again.

I used about 3 1/2 lbs of potatoes, which was enough for us, and some extra cheese. This made so much that there was no way I was getting it all to fit in a 9x11 dish...had to use a larger baking dish. Its not a very special dish and the taste is predicable but it is good. It made so much, we do have leftovers but hopefully, they too will taste good re-heated.

I made this when I had a football party at my house.  Everybody loved it.  Several wives wanted the recipe right then and they all copied together and took it home.  One of the wives already made it and took it to church for the potluck dinner and the other wife made it a week later at her house, too.  It was a big hit.  Thank you.

I served this recipe at a family get-together and it was a great hit. I did alter it a bit after having read some of the revues.

I used only 1/2 cup sour cream but added two cans of the soup. Also, I used the 5 pounds of potatoes but added 4 cups of ham instead of the 2.
I didn't have the flavoured bread crumbs, so just added some parmesan to plain bread crumbs. 

We have a potluck to go to next week and this is going to be my contribution.

A little too rich for my taste.  If I make again, will cut potatoes smaller, leave out the butter, and use low fat sour cream and soup.

I could eat this every day!!  I just estimate the amount of potatoes, maybe 6 medium.  I also like the potatoes bite size, so I don't have to cut them up as I'm eating.  I leave out all the butter & don't even miss it.  I use ritz & some cheese nips made into crumbs with food chopper for the topping.  Yummmm!!

I usually try to read other people's reviews before I try a recipe but didn't this time.  I wish I had.  Mostly it's a good recipe but I agree that about 3 - 3-1/2 lbs. of potatoes and at least doubling the ham would be a big improvement.  I think cutting the butter in 1/2 would be good.  I found parmesan croutons with cracked pepper that gave it a little kick. I will make again but with changes.

This was GOOD!  Even my picky 8-year-old ate and enjoyed it.  I made a few changes,
after reading recommendations from past reviewers:  fewer potatoes, cut them smaller,
used no butter in the sauce-- instead I used some sour cream & some heavy cream (my
hubby isn't a big sour cream fan).  I'm not sure how much ham I used:  I just bought 
a ham steak and diced it rather small.  I had to use instant minced onion instead of 
the scallions, but they worked fine and everything tasted great!  I'll definitely make 
this again, though prep took a little longer than I'd like though the results were worth 
the work!

First of all there wasn't enough ham by far and the onions were very crunchy.  I only used about 2lbs of potatoes and even with that decrease there wasn't enough ham.  I have a similar recipe using ricotta cheese and it also includes broccoli so at least it's a more balanced, and tasty meal.  I won't make this again.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!! My family loved it and we fought over the leftovers! Had to scale the recipe to what I had on hand- used 8 large white potatoes, used Italian-flavored bread crumbs, used dehydrated, minced onions, omitted the salt, doubled the ham and doubled the cheese. My potatoes cooked just fine as I chopped them up in my little chopper before boiling (made them into small, hashbrown-size cubes, with skins left on. This is definitely worth a try!

Potatoes came out crunchy.  Make sure you boil until they are fairly cooked, don't assume that the oven will cook them.

Wow!!  This is absolutely the best recipe I have tried.  I cut the potatoes in half and doubled the ham.  My father, a chef, loved it and he is very hard to impress.  This was so easy, it will become one of our "regulars".

Followed others advice, reduced potatoes down to 2 1/2 lbs and doubled the amount of ham.  Also added some fresh garlic to the onions and all turned out great.  Fat-free and low-fat substitutes for the sour cream, cream of chicken and cheese did not compromise the flavor at all, also left out butter altogether.

After reading all the reviews I took everyone's advice and added a few ideas of my own.  I agree with the less potatoes - I made 2 1/2 lbs and that was alot.  I agree with adding more ham.  I used 4 cups and that still wasn't enough.  I used 1/2 the butter called for - and that was just fine.  I used reduced fat cheddar cheese, non fat sour cream (Imo) and added no salt just pepper.  They were right - it didn't need an added salt.  It still came out great - very rich tasting.

I made this for Sunday after church. It was for my mom, my aunt and uncle, and my 2 kids. The adults LOVED it and all said it deserved 5 stars. The kids picked the ham out and ate it, which means they didn't totally reject it. I will make it again sometime for just me and the kids, but I will halve the recipe because even with 6 of us eating, there was plenty left over. I only used half a stick of butter, 3 1/2 pounds red potatoes, and about 4 cups ham. It came out perfect. Thanks!!!

Love this recipe, and although this a difficult statement to make, it has too much butter.  I will cut butter amount approx. in half next time, as it was literally floating in butter.  However, the recipe is fabulous.  We decided that it also serves as a wonderful breakfast main dish.  We had leftovers for breakfast and it was awesome.  We grow tired of typical breakfast foods, and sometimes we just don't want eggs, so this fills the bill!

Meh.  Its pretty much holiday potatoes with ham mixed in.  The breadcrumb topping wasn't needed.  I won't likely make this again unless I really need to use up some potatoes and ham - even then I'd probably try a different recipe.

I used the exact recipe.  It was OK flavor, but WAY! to many potatoes, and being "quartered" seemed to be to large for this dish.  Not enough ham and just became a lump of potatoes.  I used every dish in the house making it, and it was way to much work.  The dog liked it, but my sixteen yr old son did not care for it.

I made this recipe and put it in the crock pot on high for 5 hours. Reserving bread crumbs and half butter for last 30 minutes. I doubled the onions, could have still used more if you are Ohioan lovers like us. Also needed more ham for our liking.

I made this without changing anything and it was really good. However, next time I will add more ham (and probably bacon for my bacon loving boys) and cut the potatoes much smaller. I will also leave the butter out just to make it a teensy bit more healthy. I'm also going to try and make it in my pressure cooker (without the topping), I think that would cook it evenly and I won't have to boil potatoes or turn the oven on!

I used chicken and mushroom cream soup, yukon gold potatoes, gouda cheese instead of cheddar and made 1/2 recipe.  I also added 4 eggs to make it more of an egg bake for brunch.  Did not top it with the bread crumbs.  I left it in the oven for an additional 8 minutes until it was no longer wet and "jiggly" on top.  REALLY good!  Served in squares with a side of sour cream/salsa.

This was really good and I plan to make again.  

I was unsure if I was supposed to peel the potatoes or not.  I chose not to, but I think next time I will peel.  Also, the instructions said to "quarter" the potatoes and I didn't really know what that meant.  So, next time I want to cut the potatoes into bite size pieces b/c mine were pretty chunky.

Still 5 stars for overall flavor though.

This would be a really good way to use up leftover ham.

The flavor is soooo delicious. It just needs about half the amount of potatoes, half the amount of butter, and twice the amount of ham than the original recipes calls for and then it's perfect.

In a pinch, I used sliced deli ham and cans of mixed vegetables and it was still very good. I have two very picky tweens, so I'm thrilled to have found an easy dish to add to our supper rotation. Thanks!

Too much butter. I put about 6 tbs and it was still too much. Made it very greasy.

I roasted the potatoes first instead of boiling, used cream of mushroom, and didn't add any extra butter over what was used in the roasting. I thought it was pretty good, but my husband was not impressed. He thought it was too bland. Of course he's from the Southwest and not one for "comfort food." I would make this again for kids or if my family (from the South) was visiting.

Made this dish last night. When I was preparing it, I told my grandson, "Get ready to meet your new favorite!" I was right, he had two helpings! People couldn't put their forks down! Will be in the regular rotation!

Great taste, the sour cream gave it a nice zip. I didn't use the whole 16 oz. tub, though, probably more like 12 oz. and was still nice and tangy.  Also added more ham like other reviewers.  The cubed potatoes gave this a better texture than thin sliced like other recipes. I'll definitely make this again, thanks!

I would make it again next time but with hash brown potatoes. They would have taken less time to cook, as my potatoes still came out hard.  They had great flavor, but I was less than impressed that I even upped the heat but nothing was soft. I too used a little less butter, but my only wish was if I had known that 5 lbs of potatoes in a 9x13 dish was going to  be too much! I'd go with a bigger dish if you're looking to use whole who bag of potatoes.

Delicious!! Definitely use 2.5 lbs of potatoes, and that extra melted butter on top at the end is not necessary...(I've made it with and without the extra butter).

this came out surprisingly well.. i was worried it was going to be bland but it wasn't.. i cut this recipe in half and doubled the chicken (that i used in place of ham) and the green onion.. i decided to precook the potatoes (russets) as stated in the directions, but only for 5 min's.. i used two cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup, half the cheddar and left out the sour cream and butter.. i added in about 3.5 cups of cubed mexican squash since i wanted to use them up.. also figured it would be good to add a veggie/some nutrition to this rich dish.. i didn't have parm bread crumbs so i used 3 T of a three blend parm, 2 T of sun dried tomato flavored parm, 1/2 t oregano and garlic powder, 1/4 t marjoram, and 1/3 cup plain bread crumbs.. i'm glad i read Laura's review about mixing it all in a large bowl first b/c this would be really hard to mix in the pyrex as it makes a lot.. ty for the recipe

Pretty good recipe! I followed other's advice and cut the amount of potatoes in half, doubled the ham, doubled the green onion, and didn't add any salt. I had to cook mine for almost an hour though, so I might cut the potatoes up smaller next time or boil them a bit longer. I also thought there were too many bread crumbs. I would suggest cutting that in half as well. But, everyone liked it, so with some more minor tweaking, I think it's a keeper.

It was a huge hit!! Next time I will cut down on the butter though. I bought cubed ham and put LOTS of it in! I usually only make a serving for six as it's just my husband and myself but I used an entire can of cream of chicken soup. This is a definite keeper and is yummy as leftovers! I like lots of onion so I added extra ;)

This was great! I omitted the butter, and used cream of mushroom soup since I was out of cream of chicken. I also omitted the breadcrumbs and just sprinkled parm ontop to make it gluten free.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. Delicious casserole and a great way to use up leftover ham after the holidays. I used a small onion, chopped and sautéed it a cit before hand. I also cut up the potatoes into bite size pieces because it was a preference. I didn't put bread crumbs on top because i forgot but I think that would taste great. I served this to my company and we all agreed it is a keeper.

Liked this recipe but did not love it.  I would definitely keep the potatoes around 2.5lbs next time.  I would also add more green onion and possibly a can of cheddar condensed soup.  I added garlic bread croutons and that was a good touch.

Really liked this dish.  DO NOT add additional salt. I did not add any and it was plenty salty.  Will use low sodium soup next time. I added some sauteed mushrooms to it. I also recommend cutting the potatoes a bit smaller, mine seemed a bit too big.  Might also add some cooked broccoli next time I make it. This one is easy to customize to your liking. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was delicious! Everyone in the family asked for seconds! I do recommend cutting the potatoes into more manageable chunks, but aside from that I followed the recipe to a T and it was a huge hit! Thank you for sharing! I will definitely be making this in the future!

I first made this about 5 yrs ago and it was instantly a favorite; I have made it countless times since.  I find it very flexible; I have used several different types of potatoes (red, Russet, Yukon Gold, etc.), and ditto on the onion (red, white, yellow or green) and it has turned out great every time.  The red potatoes look prettier, but I go with what I've got!  I also cut down on the butter - using no more than 1/2 cup total.
This most recent time I decided to make it healthier and swap out 8oz of sour cream for 8oz of plain yogurt  (i.e. 1 cup each) and it was hardly noticeable and still delicious. I only had 4lbs of potatoes (it's so creamy I can't imagine cutting back on the quantity of potatoes like some reviewers say, though I could see adding more ham) and decided to add some BROCCOLI in lieu of more potatoes... perfect!  Made it truly a one-dish meal. I had about 1.5 lbs of broccoli (before cutting of the stem ends), which I cut into bite-sized pieces and steamed for about 10 mins. To save energy/water/nutrients/dishes (though not time), I then added more water to the pot I had steamed the broccoli in and put the potatoes in the same pot. You can drain the potatoes with your pot lid and add soup, etc. right to the same pot, too.
For my family of 3, I can divide this into smaller dishes (two 8x8 dishes, or an 8x8 and a 7x9) and put 1 in the oven and 1 in the freezer. Thaw, add bread crumbs/butter drizzle, and bake for 35-40 mins since it starts out cold.  Easy!

I always look forward to ham leftovers from Christmas and Easter so I can make this.  I've even made it as a side dish without the ham because it tastes so much like my mother's delmonico potatoes.  It's just as good reheated for breakfast.

This was excellent except for the instructions didn't say to peel the redskin potatoes. I followed it as written but would recommend peeling potatoes or use the frozen hashbrown pototoes to save time. I also used the Kraft Shredded Cheddar w/ a Touch of Philly.  It was nice and creamy.

I used the mandolin to slice all five pounds of the potatoes uniformly.  I omitted the butter from the mix, I used two bunch of green onions, because that's how they were sold, I used a whole package of OM ham, which was probably at least three cups.  I just sprinkled the bread crumbs over the top and drizzed 1T melted butter to help it brown.  All of this barely fit into the 9x13 casserole dish and was so dense that it took 45 minutes to bake, plus 20 minutes to set up.  The result was fantastic.  My husband wasn't a huge fan of the texture of the green onions so I think I'll saute' a diced white onion next time to toss in instead.  This is really easy to put together and very tasty.

Great recipe. Good taste and consistency.    My husband loved it.  I only used about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, and it was plenty.  I think 1 1/2 cups would be way to much.

This has a great taste to it...although I didn't use the cream of soup or the bread crumbs. Made a cream base with cheese and poured over the potatoes and added more cheese on top instead of bread crumbs. Very good!!!

I prepared the dish this morning, put it in the fridge, and heated it for dinner.  I halfed the recipe, used a few less potatoes but, followed the recipe.  I was amazed at how good it was.  Guess what....three of us ate the entire dish.  Of course we had seconds.  My son recommended that I add Dijon mustard next time. Since I cut the recipe in half I will try 1 tablespoon to give it some jazz. Great dish for a potluck.  A keeper.

Recipe was good, however was more like a side dish not main course.  Kids not too fond of this meal, either.  It was better next day.

I made this last night with left-over ham from Easter.  It was EXCELLENT!  However, next time I wouldn't serve it as the main dish, it tasted much like twice-baked potatoes, so it you don't have ham, maybe substitute with bacon and serve it as a side dish.

To be fair I know that I over cooked the potatoes and that they were soft in this recipe but we thought this was not a great recipe. The mixture tasted good before I added the potatoes. After baking we just did not care for it.

I think this is a yummy recipe.  It is very rich and filling.  I think it would go great for a potluck, but it was a little overwhelming as a main dish.  Thank you, I think I will make this for Easter this year.

This was really good, I brought it to eat with my inlaws and even my picky father in law liked it...I used less potatoes and less sour cream, oh and no extra butter in the soup mixture, and it still came out great.

Three of the five of us thought it was fabulous, but the other two thought it was okay.  I made it exactly as stated, and it overflowed my 9x13 casserole and made a lot of smoke. (This could have swayed one voter, who is rather sensitive to odors.)  The one thing I didn't do was top the breadcrumbs with melted butter, but I don't think it really made a difference to the taste.  I liked it, I'll make it again for potluck suppers, but I'll definitely use fewer potatoes.

This was delicious.  I willl have to remember the next time I make it though not to get canned ham.  It had too much grissle and ruined the excellent flavor.  My husband really liked this, but said next time I should use a different ham as well.  Other than that, it was great.  I did omit the milk and use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.  EXCELLENT flavor.

Way too greasy! I followed the recipe word for word and felt like the potatoes were swimming in a puddle of butter. Won't make this again.

This is a new family favorite for us.  It is so easy and enough for our family of 4 to have for two dinners.  I do omit the butter from the soup/sour cream mixture and instead of bread crumbs I use ground cornflakes.

I've made this recipe a few times now.  The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly (like I do with all recipes).  The only changes I made for all subsequent preparations was to cut the ham in half and use panko crumbs for a crispier topping.  I love it and agree with other reviewers that it is a great pot luck dish.  If you make it for home, the leftovers are just as tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This wasn't a wow, but it wasn't bad either.  It was very easy to assemble...I actually just sort of eyeballed the amounts without measuring, and it was a good way to use up leftover ham.  It was just a very heavy dinner.

I wasn't even finished cooking this and I could tell that this was a 5 star recipie.  I wasn't as smart as some so I left the 5lbs of potatoes mixed with everything else in the 9x13 pan.  Would have fit into a turkey roaster if I used one.  The only things I did differently was to use a whole 1.5lb ham steak, which I cubed and I added 1/2lb of fresh mushrooms.  This looks good even before I cooked it!  Cant wait till its finished!

I used other reviewers suggestions and halfed the potatoes and doubled the ham.  I think next time I will leave it alone.  Doubling the ham was WAY too much.  I thought it was ok, I only liked the potatoes.  My husband thought it was awesome and wants me to make it again and again.

If you want a dish that is filling and a meal in itself. Then this is it! It is delicious tasting and easy to make. It is a new favorite to my family of 7. The only alterations I made was that I added a little more cream of chicken soup and sour cream for added moisture.

I've made this at least a dozen times since stumbling across the recipe last fall, and it's fantastic.  I've experimented with a few different things to try and give it a little more kick, but what has worked the best is throwing in a little bit of rosemary and salt.

Excellent recipe for a cold night. It's a hearty and comforting dish. I would have given it five stars, but I added extra green onion and sauteed minced garlic for more flavor. The additions added a lot of flavor. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This was pretty good. Although the people I fed it to suggested it would be better if I had substituted macaroni for the potatoes. Will have to try that next time.

My dad loved this recipe! He asks for it quite often. I've made it a few times and have found it's better if the potatoes are cut into smaller pieces and if I add more ham.  A meal in itself.

My kids loved this, but my husband and I found it to be too heavy. I think next time I'll try making it without the butter. I don't think it needed it.

This is a really tasty casserole.  I used pork strips instead of ham and added some corn and broccoli.  I omitted the butter.  We enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

Awesome recipe, but only 4 stars because it needed some changes. Per other reviews, I used 2 cups of potatoes and 3 cups of ham. Next time I'll skip the butter and the topping completely - I didn't think they added anything. Tasted just like a baked potato!

I really liked this one.  The only thing I did differently was I added some minced garlic to the sauce.  I actually ended up overcooking my potatoes to start with and to prevent turning it to mashed potatoes I poured the potatoes into the casserole dish by themselves and layered the sour cream mixture on top.  The heat sort of melted the mixture through all of the potatoes.  It came out great!  Next time, I'll try to remember to pull the potatoes out earlier, but otherwise great recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, however my husband did not like it at all and my 2 year old would only take one bite!  I did make a few changes to the recipe, and I thought it was pretty good.  I halved the recipe, and used half sour cream and half cream cheese.  I also doubled the soup, and the mixture didn't quite coat the potatoes.  I added in some bacon and used crushed cheddar garlic croutons for the topping.  Also, 30 minutes was not enough bake time.  I had it in the oven for 50 minutes and some of the potatoes were still not cooked through, so you definitely want to allow for some additional cooking time.  Since I was the only one who liked it, I won't make it again, but I would recommend that you try it!

A wonderful way to use leftover ham!  The texture is very creamy and smooth. I may try adding a little mustard powder next time to give the casserole some  zing. Also, I found that 5 lb. of potatoes do not fit well in a 9x13 pan, so I lined my broiler pan with non-stick foil and baked the casserole successfully with minimal cleanup.

I made this recipe as directed - it was very tasty, however the ham was scant.  I will triple the amount of ham next time.  Delicious flavor - tasted even better the next day!

My husband and I loved this dish.  It is very rich and creamy, and definitely not low fat.  I also used 2.5 to 3 lbs of potatoes, but I also cut the sour cream to 1 cup instead of two and also cut the butter down some.  It is even more delicious as leftovers.  I make this recipe all the time!  Thanks for sharing!

A pain to mix, I only left the potatoes boil 8 minutes and they still got pretty mashed when I tried to mix all the ingredients together.  Taste was good, next time I will use virginia ham to give the added salty taste.  I thought this one was going to be a dud until the guys gobbled it up.

Great so easy to make, I used pre. cooked potatoes, so it cut that step out. I also added a can of sweet corn, trying to get the veggies in.

We loved this recipe!  I played with the ingredients a little:  cream of celery instead of chicken, added 1 tsp. of garlic powder, used minced onion (although green would have been better), used italian bread crumbs and added no additional salt.  I used baking potatoes instead of red (although I'm sure red would make it even better!)and I used slightly more of the condensed soup than called for (I halved the recipe and used just over half a can).  This recipe is a keeper--I also used a metal pan as suggested earlier.

Very good Flavor but did not like the big chunks of potatoes. Next time I make I think I will try shredding the potatoes into hashbrowns, and instead of preboiling will just bake longer, and add the bread crumbs during the last 1/2 hour of baking. Speaking of bread crumbs, will definitely decrease by about half. When you bit into a spot with the bread crumbs there were just too many. Also if you do prepare potatoes as recommended, would advise to cook for longer than 1/2 hour, because everything was still cool. With a few adjustments this could be a great recipe.

This is almost as good as my grandmother's.  We use half as much sour cream, cream of mushroom soup and fewer potatoes.  Anyway you serve it, though, it's still good.

I was looking forward to a new version of scalloped potatoes, but I found this recipe very bland.  It needs herbs of some kind - maybe rosemary?  I will not make this again.

This recipe was great!  Serious comfort food, and excellent for using up leftover ham.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so instead I used Ritz crackers with the butter on top and it turned out great...gave it a little crunch!

This was a big hit with my family. As previously suggested I also cut down on potatoes and added more ham. I sauteed three leeks (washed well - white part only - chopped)in 3 TBSP. butter and substituted for the green onions - this really perked it up!Omitted salt and used crushed croutons mixed with Parmesan for topping. Will definitely make this again.

I really liked this recipe. Although I did some tinkering. Instead of adding cream soap I added a pkg of gravy. I also substitued the sour cream for 1/2 & 1/2 cream cheese/sour cream. I used only 3# of potatoes. And 2X the ham called for. Instead of cheddar I added velveeta sauce. Also some chives made it very nice. Oh and I didn't add any of the butter called for. And since I didn't have parm bread crumbs I added some parm to the mixture and just put italian bread crumbs on top! YUMMY This is stayin in my recipe box!

This dish needs more and larger pieces of ham to be a main dish. I will also change the topping (maybe Ritz) when I make it again... Looking forward to it!

My family loves this dish! I usually cut back on the potatoes and use around 3 1/2 pounds and use whatever leftover ham is in the fridge. Sometimes more than called for, sometimes less but it always turns out great! I keep meaning to try it with ground beef but haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm always wanting to have the leftovers for lunch the next day but there's never any leftovers!!

I can see why this gets such good reviews.  Great recipe with lots of flavor!  I took another person's advice and poured a little milk around the edges.  I used red. fat cheddar, sour cream, and used just a little less marg. and it was yummy!  My husband loved it too!

I have to give this an excellent.  Hubby and 15yr old loved it.  When our college one came home, dad said we had to try it again for her.  This is in the keep file. We add some of the shredded cheese to the top as well.  Great for leftovers.
Thanks.

This was pretty good.  I would make it again.  

Never thought to add Cream of chicken.  To lower the calories fat I used Fat Free Cream Of Chicken and FF Sour Cream along with 2% Cheese.

We loved this.  Instead of ham, I used a cooked & chopped chicken breast.  I also followed anothers advice & used ritz cracker crumbs instead of breadcrumbs.  I mixed parmesan cheese with them too.  To keep the casserole moist I poured about 1/4 cup of milk around the side.

I really liked the way this recipe sounded, but had to tweek it alot to suit my family.  First - I nuked to potates for 20 minutes.  I used all but 3 potatoes from a 5 lb. bag.  I used a really good "deli" ham.  I just asked for 4 half inch slices of our favorite ham.  I got about 5 cups from that and it was perfect mixture of ham and potatoes.  I used two cans of cream of celery soup and the 16 oz of sour cream.  We wanted a more "soupy" consistency and it was perfect for us.  It did look "soupy" coming out of the oven, but we let it rest while making the salad and setting the table.  The other thing I did was to saute yellow onion in about 4 tbl of butter on the stove and then add that to the soup mixture.  I didn't want raw onion flavor in the casserole.  I can't image all that butter - for what? I used an 8 oz block of cheddar and that was perfect.  I feed my family of 7 and my husband had tons for lunch the next day.  This was a perfect "comfort food" dinner and I made it early and just popped it in the over for about 1 and 1/2 hours on 325.

Pretty good! I would save this dish for a potluck dinner in the future. The taste is fantastic but there's just sooo much (potatoes to me are an excellent side-dish not a main meal). Five stars for the taste though!

Fabulous!!  The only changes I made were to add peas, for some color, and I only used 3 lbs. of potatoes.  I don't know how 5 lbs. would have fit!  Otherwise, the meal was so flavorful and satisfying!  Definitly  will make it again!

This is a great comforting casserole, and very easy to make.  It's very rich though, so it gets 'old' fast.  I used chopped yellow onions in the recipe; if you do this, be sure to sautee or microwave them first so they are fully cooked.

I liked this recipe.  Husband took seconds (which is always a good indicator in our house) and it was a great way to use up both some leftover ham and some boiled potatoes that I had in the fridge.  Will keep this one in mind!  Thx for the post, Terri...

Great recipe. I am not a big fan of Ham, but my finace loved it. I mashed the red potatoes (skin and all) then mixed it together. I added a touch of ranch dressing. Made it a little too creamy, but the taste was good.

I'm sorry but we didn't care for this at all.  My husband is not a picky eater and this didn't go over well at all.  I wasted all that money on the ham.  But in defense of the recipe this is the first time I used potatoes in a casserole.  We noramlly have it with noodles so that could be it.  I threw it out wouldn't even give it to the dogs!

It's like someone made cheesy potatoes and added ham to it to make it a maindish.  I didn't pay attention to the recipe before making it and was shocked to see how much butter and sour cream the recipe called for.  Although,I really enjoyed the tip on boiling the potatoes to cut down on the baking time.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I didn't use them, and I didn't bother with the butter and used less potatoes, as suggested in previous reviews. I loved the baked potato with all the trimmings taste! My husband went nuts over this! Served with a veggie or a salad this is a complete meal. It is hard to go wrong with the basics. I will make this all winter long!

Very good and filling. I halved the recipe and still had leftovers.  My husband has a fear of canned meat, so I was a little scared he wouldn't like it when I used canned ham (I cut it up into very small pieces and browned it in a small amt. of butter).  But he loved it and said he would definitely eat it again.

My son loved the ham and my husband thought it was a breakfast dish (to be served with eggs).  I am not crazy abou it.  but it makes a TON even when you cut the potatoes in 1/2 like we did.  otherwise i followed the directions to the T.  I thought it was a bit tangy (sourcream) but ez to make and serves a lot for a little money.  Probably won't make it again tho.

This is very good. I too added more cheese and ham. I also boiled the potatoes first. A definite keeper.

I loved this! It was so good that I made it again 2 days later. Definitely use less potatoes and more ham. I also scaled this down and made it without the ham as a side dish. It was great. Just mixed all the ingredients together (course I boiled the potatoes first)and heated it up in the microwave. Everyone raved....

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the directions exactly and afterwards had really wished that I had listened to another reviewer about fully cooking the potatoes before baking. I also found the recipie to be a little lacking in taste as well as nutrition. Second time round I sauted a medium onion with 2 cloves garlic and also added a can of peas to solve this problem. It turned out increadible! My 13 yr. old who turned his nose up the first time I made this dish had thirds! Both times that I made this I used 1/2 the reccomended potatoes as well as regular bread crumbs

I made this for dinner quite a while ago and just now got around to reviewing it! I loved this.
The only problem that I had was that the potatoes were still a little bit too crunchy, but otherwsie
a great dish. No complaints here.

I made this recipe for my husband 2 days ago. He LOVED it!!! I reduced the amount of red potatoes in 1/2, and doubled the cheese as some of the previous reviews recommended. I also added about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese in with the mixture. I used Ritz crackers crumbs for the topping rather than bread crumbs which gave it a nicer taste. Overall this is a wonderful dish! Fast, easy, and delicious. A+

Yum!  I made this for a birthday party dinner & everyone loved it.  A great time saver that I used was an apple/peeler/corer.  It saved time cutting the potatoes & cut down on the boiling time as they are much thinner pieces.  I would recommend this to anyone!

It is a easy one meal casserole. It could have had more ham- added 1 cup later for leftovers. Didn't care for the bread crumbs. Family wanted alittle more cheese so maybe omit bread crumbs and add more cheese to it. Similar to a cheesy red potatoe recipe I have using cheese whiz. Overall pretty good recipe. Good for potlucks!

When i made this I used Garlic cream of chicken soup and I sliced the potatoes instead of quatering, VERY GOOD! My husband (who hates ham) loved it!

Great recipe, Terri!  Used country sausage cut in chunks, instead of ham, and it was excellent.  Brought it to a reception and it was totally wiped out.  Thanks for a good one!

I made this with 4 lbs potatoes and low fat sour cream and low fat chix soup.  It was still wonderful and incredibly rich.  One of my kids liked it, the other didn't.  I would make this one again.....my husband really liked it!

This was pretty good, but I don't think I would make it again. Cheesey potatoes made with hashbrowns are better, and just as easy.

When I made this, I was shocked at the amount.  Just my husband and I at home and I knew I would have to throw alot of it away.
My husband took it to work the next day and ate it cold.  He said it was the best potato salad he ever had.  His co-workers wanted some and the next day he took it all and it was gone it minutes!  They keep asking when I am going to make it again.

Amazing!!!!

Super good.  We loved it.  I used it on some company.  I did cut the amount of potatoes in half and dbled the ham as suggested by other users.  My 2 yr old wouldn't eat anything but the ham but that's his stage right now.   hehehe

The first time I made this my toddler daughter ate her helping and then started in on mine!  I've made this for carry-in dinners, friends, and for my family and everyone agrees, it is a winner.

I have had success making it in my 9x13 stoneware baker.  Great taste and easy clean up that way!

Loved this recipe-I did slice the potatoes though.  And instead of boiling the potatoes just cooked the dish for a longer amount of time.

Tasted great even as leftovers, which we're not typically fond of, but would slice the potatoes next time, esp. for little kids...

This is a GREAT recipe.  I used low-fat versions of most of the ingredients and it was still great.  I bet it would work with chicken instead of ham and be even healthier.  Also, I drizzled hot sauce over my serving and...wow!

This was really good, but way too salty. Next time I plan to use a low-sodium cream of chicken soup. I also made it with four pounds of potatoes and added another cup of ham and was pleased with the results.

If you love a stuffed baked potato with the works, you will definitely love this recipe! I didn't have red potatoes so I peeled & quartered russet potatoes and it still turned out awesome! Great for potlucks or family gatherings because it makes quite alot and it is very filling, but be prepared to share the recipe! Thanks for sharing! This is already one of my favorites!

This recipe was very tasty. I used fat free chicken soup and left out the butter altogether and the result was still excellent with a lot less fat.

Was pretty good, but mine turned out really greasy.  I followed the recipe for the amount of butter.  I will try it next time with less butter.

potatoes overwhelm the ham in this recipe, though it is very tasty.  double the ham and cut the potatoes in half if you want it to be a true "meat" casserole

I used 4 lbs of potatoes, 3 cups of ham and no salt (there's plenty in the soup and ham). We loved it! Very rich and creamy and satisfying.

Good recipe.  However, I too reduced the amount of potatoes to 4 lbs.  But in doing so, I think that it makes the dish a bit too salty.  Canned soup is already salty, plus the ham, and then it calls for salt.  I would suggest not adding any extra salt to this recipe and just stick with seasoning it with pepper.  I would also like to try not adding the stick of butter to the recipe - I don't think it would do anything to the integrity of the cream mixture if it were omitted.

Spectacular!  I made this for a dinner party and it was a smashing success. I did, however, reduce the amount of potatoes to 4 pounds, used Yukon Gold potatoes, and added an extra can of soup, and 1 1/2 teaspoons each of dry mustard and garlic powder.  I definitely will make this again!
