I only made one small change, try this as it really spices up this dessert. Add 1 Cup of good brandy or cognac, blend that in to the other ingredients, that reall y changes the flavor, WOW!

I thought this was tasty and easy. I couldn't find pineapple sherbet. In fact, the store I went to didn't have any sherbet, so I used mango sorbet and strawberry sorbet from Haggendasz. I put the bananas in the mango sorbet and the raspberries in the strawberry sorbet, and then I layered the two in juice glasses and refroze them. I took them to my parents' for mothers day and set them out while we ate lunch. Then I upturned them on plates, and they made cute little layered cylinders. My mom loved them, and my dad was happy that he could eat them, since he can't have gluten. A quick and impressive dessert! Thanks!

This is one of the most delicious desserts I have EVER tasted!  From the first time we introduced it into our family it was a HIT, and has been the dessert of choice ever since.  Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe; it packs a lot of flavor and will quickly become one of YOUR favorites, too!  Just make sure to serve it fairly frozen.

Very good. Just make sure you remember to thaw the raspberries. I didn't, and they were a little crunchy. :) The bananas were heavenly with the sherbet. Very nice, light dessert.

Refreshing dessert.  Really liked how the raspberry blended with the pineapple sherbet.  The bananas were fine - although if I make this again I will just mix the sherbet and raspberries together.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked how simple it was to make this dessert.  As far as taste goes, it was a little tart, but I still thought it was good but no one else but my one year old was interested in eating any.
