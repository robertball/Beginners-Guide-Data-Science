Yummy dip -- TIP: dip your apples in lemon-lime soda (regular or sugar-free) to keep them from browning without impacting the apple's flavor.

This was delicious--we all just scarfed it up. For me, it was a little sweet but next time, I could just cut back on the brown sugar just a touch. The kids especially liked this, they asked me to make it again this morning for breakfast!

My dad actually brought this recipe home with him after an out-of-town trip. He had tried it at a church he attended and enjoyed it so much that he obtained the recipe. Now it is our absolute favorite apple dip. We often make it for church functions, family parties, and holidays. It is a big hit every time!!

Wonderful! At first thought there was too much toffee but after it sat and flavors blended more - wouldn't change a thing.  I also had apple crisp chips for this - just as yummy - some guest preferred the chips over apple slices.

I changed the servings from 6 to three and also reduced the amount of sugar.  I only used 2T brown and 1T white.  This was sweet enough and the skor bars gave it a nice crunch!

I love this recipe and have made it many times. It always gets tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. I usually use about 2/3 of the pkg of toffee.

Fantastic. I only followed the dip portion, we all just sliced up Gala and Honeycrisp apples fresh to dip in whenever we wanted some. I think toffee bits with chocolate would be too much: as written this is quite sweet and chocolate would overwhelm the creamy toffee-ness. In the future I will try this with 1/4c brown, 1/8c white sugar but I don't like the really sweet stuff: this dip as written is delicious. Thanks so much for sharing.

I thought there would be way too much toffee in the dip.  I was glad I followed the recipe as written though because it was excellent!  Best of all, it is something a little different than all the other recipes out there.  Thank you very much!

Really yummy! But so sweet one spoonful gave me a stomach ache. And I only used 3 ounces of toffee chips! I added a splash of lemon juice to cut the sweetness and next time I will probably cut the sugar by at least half. With less sugar I could become seriously addicted to this dip :D

This dip is absolutely delicious! I made it for a get together and had so many compliments on it. I made it to recipe. It made enough for more than 4 apples though.

It's very difficult not to stand there and eat the whole thing with a spoon before it ever meets an apple slice.  This is absolutely my favorite apple dip ever.

I went to a get together last night where everyone brought something, and this was such a hit! It is definitely different from the standard fruit dip. My only suggestion would be to make it a little thicker somehow. Thanks!

My kids loved it! An easy way to get them to eat fruit as a snack. Packs great in a lunchbox with an ice pack, too.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious! I used heath bits with chocolate in it. So yummy! I think I will go for the toffee only as I have had that kind before and think it tastes just a little bit better!

I brought this to a neighborhood picnic and had quite a few people ask me for the recipe. It's pretty sweet, so pairing it with green apples was a good way to go. I'd make it again for a party but probably not for snacking at home since it makes a big ball and the sweetness would get old if you're trying to get through the whole thing before it goes bad. Anyway, I recommend this as a SWEET option to go along with other savory items.

I made this to take to a birthday/pool party where a lot of children would be attending. The dip was not only enjoyed by the kids but the adults were eating it like crazy. I really didn't make any changes just made double batch & used one regular cream cheese & the other was creamy in the tub variety. Made it easy to whip & creamier. Will definitely make this dip again.

I thought this was pretty good.  I cut the sugar in half, though and next time I think I'll reduce it even more, as I think the brickle chips make it plenty sweet enough on their own.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent dip! Easily doubles! If you can't find Heath Bits O'Brickle, just put Heath bars in a ziplock bag and pound with a wooden rolling pin. :) Works perfect!

I've made this countless times. I agree with other reviewers that either toffee chips or chocolate-toffee chips can be used....we prefer the chocolate. All kids who come over devour this yummy dip. Pair with honey crisp apples for perfection!

I made this for my daughter's summer wedding and it was a hit! While cutting the apples, I put them in a large bowl of pineapple juice to keep them from browning. The apples stayed fresh for even a couple of days after.  The toffee chips (i used the chocolate ones) gave a crunchy/chewy perfection to the dip. Don't leave those out!

I ended up putting the toffee bits on top cause I had already put the dip into its final container and didn't want to mess with it. So.... Wasn't stirred in but ended up fine anyway. I also used a pastry brush to coat the apple slices with the juices for even distribution.  Simple.

Everyone loves this dip! Friends specifically request that I bring this to parties and gatherings now.I use the Heath toffee pieces because I love milk chocolate, and I often buy bags of pre-sliced apples to cut down on the prep time.

Lessen the sugar, had no brown sugar or vanilla at the office and it still tastes great. Eating the apples too fast for them to brown. I know I will make this again.

Delicious, super-easy.  I prefer it a little less sweet, so I left out the white sugar.  Simple and tasty.

It was almost gone before I could even get some. Very good.
