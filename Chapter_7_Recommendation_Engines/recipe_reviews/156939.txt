Fantastic and spicy!! I used 5 BLSL chicken breasts halves and 3 serrano and 1 habanero chile peppers instead as I didn't have the red chile peppers. I did not de-seed the serranos. Also, I used a small white onion and 2 big cloves shallots in place of the red onion as I didn't have any. Also omitted cardamom as I didn't have them too. Used cinnamon powder instead of stick. Skipped the sugar and didn't miss it. Although it sounds like I changed it by quite a bit, but I think only the chile pepper made a more significant difference. Love this dish and would definitely make it again - with and without the adjustments. Thank you for a recipe that reminded me of home...

I used half a chicken and about 12 dried chillies. Followed the recipe and it turned out well. Definitely a keeper.

I cut the chili peppers in half and we really enjoyed it. unless you like it extremely spicy, reduce the dried chili.

This dish is spicy hot but nice! Those who cannot take very spicy food, you  may want to reduce the chillies.
