I added sauted onion, bell pepper, garlic, and ginger to give it more flavor.

This was very good, simple and easy. The only thing I will add next time is a little cayenne or red pepper flake to give it a little heat and balance the sweetness of the pineapple. Great week night meal!

Very good.  I didn't have a yellow rice mix, so I used Minute Rice.  With the water and pineapple juice, it was a little watery, so next time I'll use less water.  I did as others suggested and added green peppers, onions, garlic and a little red pepper.  Easy, colorful and good.

Very easy.  I took the advice of someone to add a little spice to it. So I added a pinch of both cayenne and red pepper.  Seemed to offset the sweetness of the pineapple.  I will use this in the future!

Easy to make recipe if you have the time.
Suggest adding 2T of salsa to each serving for some extra flavor

This was a simple to make dish. It had a lot of flavor and my family enjoyed it. I have put this on the "make again" meal list.

Not a lot of flavor but not a bad dish. I made it for 10 people and the recipe was easy to increase and still came out great. It's freaking hot in the Midwest so I heated my grill to 350 and cooked it outside and it came out perfect and the chicken was very tender and juicy.

This was a nice meal but a bit bland. It needed something to give it a push. Thank you for the recipe.
