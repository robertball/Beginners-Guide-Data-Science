Although my kids may love it, I'd recommend
keping this one to adults. What I will say
is this one is a REAL sleeper! Collect the car
keys and lock the doors, people are going to
wild with this one!

Thanks Gene

Just like kids, one is not enough but two is WAY too many!  I don't know how I make it upstairs to bed after two of these bad boys!  They are good, but definitely not for the lightweight drinker!

Gene, you missed one important ingredient... Sweet & Sour. It gives it the ice tea tang. Then top with a splash of coke for the color.This is the way my fav restaurant (The Rusty Pelican) serves them and don't forget a squeeze of fresh lemon. My mouth is watering!

I made this drink as written and it did not taste like a Long Island Iced Tea. Made two important changes and it did. It needed 2 ounces of sour mix to give it that lemoney tang and I only used enough cola to change the color to that of ice tea. I mixed all ingredients with the exception of the cola in a shaker filled with ice, shook, then poured that into a glass and then topped with the cola. With changes 5 stars.

I made these the other night for mu husband and I, and they were delicious. I used the suggested amounts of ingredients, and the drinks came out perfect. Easy to make and as another reviewer stated 'foolproof'. Wonderful!

You are missing Sweet n Sour.  I used to make LIT all the times when I was in my 20's.  As Jeckel said, people are going wild with this one - it's true!  My friends say I make the best LIT and I gotta agree with them!  :) ooHHHhhh I want some now!

The bartender at my local used to take my keys and force me to take a nap in my car when I had two of these mofos :)

Sweet and sour may not have been a bad look, tho....

I liked it very much.  It doesn't have the citrus flavor but I liked it just as listed.  I call this one Gene's Special Tea.  I also plant to add peach schnapps one time.
