These taste like sugar cookies with a hint of strawberry. I decided to jazz them up with a Hershey kiss on top, a la the classic cookies Peanut Butter Blossoms. Without the Kiss on top, I would probably only give these three stars as they're kind of blah.

I made these for an event with a pink theme.  They were fairly good with the slight taste of strawberry from the Nesquik, but not my favorite cookie recipe.  Will probably not make them again.
