Tasty, adorable little snack! Seems like a lot of effort for such a tiny amount of peanut butter to get in there, but really makes a difference. I used Nestle white chocolate chips, and they didn't melt so well so I ended up having to add shortening to them. Otherwise this was fairly simple, a little fussy but worth the effort for cute little shark teeth! Happy Shark Week!

was pretty good.  I started out piping pb filling in and that got old very quickly that my daughter and I ended up dipping the bagels in the pb--faster process.  Then we poured the white chocolate over the bagels and drizzled with dark chocolate.  We use 1 pound of white and 1 pound of chocolate and melted it on the stove.

I have never made these using peanut butter inside before so I was excited to make these.  Love how they turned out but I did end up using almost a 14 oz bag of bugles to use all the peanut butter and I needed 35 ounces of chocolate to cover them.  Perhaps if the bugles were opened wide rather than having a narrow opening the recipe amounts would have been perfect.

I searched this recipe out because a friend would distribute Christmas cookies every year, which included a handful of Bugles with peanut butter and chocolate.  Hers were almost identical, except she used milk chocolate and only dipped the large end of the Bugle, so you could see the actual Bugle's color, but not the peanut butter inside.  Perfect melody of salt and sweetness with a little crunch.  Love these!! (never tried with white chocolate).
