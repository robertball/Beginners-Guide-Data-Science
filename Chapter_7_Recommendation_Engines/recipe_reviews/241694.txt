I will probably make it again maybe for a pot luck. I browned the ground beef in a large cast iron skillet, added all the other ingredients on the list and baked in the oven right in the pan. I cut way back on the brown sugar (about 2 Tbs.). because my brown sugar was old and rock hard. I am glad that I did, it was more than sweet enough.

Needed a recipe that I could throw together easily. I only had one can of pork and beans so I substituted with maple baked beans. Very yummy. Bring on the comfort food!!!!

This was good and easy.  I decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I served it with corn bread.  The whole family liked it. Good weekend meal.
