I used cilantro because I don't have fresh thyme, but can
t wait to try this recipe as written!  Smooth, almost creamy, patties with great flavor!

I followed the recipe except for I didnâ€™t make the mixture into balls. I spooned the mixture into a ball, then placed it in the skillet and formed my patties that way. I cooked the patties on a low setting for 3 to 4 minutes ( until dark golden brown) and cooked the same amount of time on the other side. Note: I did notice that the mixture gets firmer the longer it sits in the bowl and its much easier to work with.

These not only fell apart when I fried them but also stuck to my hands when I pressed them into patties. I had to just about scrap them off my hand into the pan. I wonder if it was b/c I had just also finished cooking the quinoa and yam (I like yams better) and they were both still pretty warm. Maybe if I let them cool I'd have better luck. Will try again b/c I like the overall recipe. I would also use more sea salt and thyme next time as this batch was a little bland.

Great idea.  Love the ingredients!  The patties fell apart while I was frying them.  I added an egg.  Still no good.  I wanted this to work.  Any suggestions to "bind" the ingredients?  I also added cinnamon.
