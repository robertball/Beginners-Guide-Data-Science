Made a batch.  Mom and I both loved it.  But had alot of leftovers which we wanted.  2 days later found LISA B7 recipe for Potato Spinach Cassrole but didn't want to be troubled with making the mashed potatoes so I used the leftover Pots and Cauliflower omitting the butter in LISA B7 recipe. Thank you both reposted as Potato Spinach Casserole with Cauliflower.  Reposted trying to ensure credit to kdelegan are LISA B7 is given.

AWESOME!!  Perfect for a feast, when you need the oven for other dishes.  I used 5 lbs potatoes, skins on, and omitted the cauliflower.  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Hearty and delicious!!!  Thanks :)

I had a 2 lb bag of potatoes that needed to be used and also a head of cauliflower I did not want to go bad. So after looking around the internet for a mashed potato and cauliflower recipe I went back to my trusted All Recipes site and here it is!
Chose to make this with out Christmas Eve dinner of ham and fixings and it was a hit! Will make sure to prepare this with other dinners whether for a holiday or not.

Fluffy little clouds of goodness. Perfect mashers for those lazy days using the slow cooker. I will be making these again. I like the idea that the sour cream is not over powering. Today's slow cookers cook at a higher temp. This was done in a little over 4 hours.

Great way to get some extra veggies in your meal. I used red skin potatoes and didn't peel them.

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner! I drained off the chicken broth at the end before I whipped the potatoes because a read a review that said it was runny. Mine turned out perfect. Everyone said they were better than regular potoes!

This was good and a great way of adding extra veggies into a meal. I had mine along side some corn and stuffing. It was the perfect accompaniment and it was easy to make. Thanks!

We had Thanksgiving early this year and I tried all new recipes. This was our least favorite that I made. It was lumpy and I had to remove the potatoes and cauliflower from the slow cooker after more than 6 hours and finish steaming on the stove because they never got done  in the crockpot.  I also prefer creamy potatoes than lumpy potatoes, so I will not try this recipe again.

Just made this.  Used small golden potatoes, skin on.  Going on suggestions from other reviews: I prefer stiff mash so adding milk to the broth already in the pot does make it too thin.  Three options: strain majority of the broth before mashing and adding milk, don't add the milk, OR use a full 3lb bag (or more) of potatoes.  I didn't add milk; don't think the creaminess was diminished due to the sour cream.  Also, I used 1 tsp pepper rather than 1T and it is still quite peppery.

This is a good recipe only it takes too long. I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I did it the old fashioned way on the stove and it tasted excellent.

This is one awesome recipe!! I used small red potatoes and left the skin on. I couldn't stop taste testing. My family ask me why I hadn't been making potatoes like this before. They all loved them and I will definitely be making these in place of plain mashed potatoes!!

Loved this recipe! By the time it is done - most people didn't even know that there was cauliflower in the recipe. Great for those who dont love potatoes. Only change I made was to replace sour cream with greek yogurt.

I really liked this recipe. I halved the ingredients and followed the proportions. I thought it was a tad mushy so the next time, I may cut down on the milk. My slow cooker heats at a higher temperature, so I kept it for two hours each time. Overall, a good recipe and a great way to use up cauliflower. I'll make it again.

Visually it seems gritty, but it came out so creamy if you take extra time to mash it smooth like I did. My vegetable hating family loved it (although, I did add bacon bits at the end to give a hint of smoky flavor to it.)

A very good dish and a good one for people who don't care for cauliflower but should be eating it. Since I like some spice to my dishes, I would add some spice, like sir ancho or tobacco sauce.

This did NOT work out for me.  After 3 hrs. in the crockpot on Low, my potatoes were still hard.  As instructed, I added the cauliflower and cooked another 3 hrs. on Low.  I ended up having to dump everything into a dutch oven, add water, and boil it for 15 minutes before the veggies were done.  FAIL!

Very good though mine didn't come out very white.  I used homemade chicken stock, which may have more body to it than the commercial stuff.  I would make it again, probably using red-skinned potatoes as they usually make for  whiter mashed potatoes.  Probably leave the skin on, too, for a nice visual contrast.

Great texture but too much pepper. Will make again but with 1/3 to 1/2 the pepper and maybe a little more salted butter.

Only used 1/2 the pepper and it was still too much. Smell of cauliflower cooking  for 3 hours also not appealing.

Recipe called for too much black pepper, but otherwise, delicious!  I didn't mind some soft lumps, but if you insist on creamy, don't use the stems of the cauli, only the blossoms.

It's about halfway through and all mashed down but still seems too watery. I'll let it go a little longer, hopefully it will get better

i needed a crock pot recipe for a potluck and tried this.  it's ok - i still like it - however, if/when i make again, i will do 8oz of sr cream, probably do 3/4 stick of butter, 1/2 tsp paprika (i love paprika) and cut the black pepper to 1/4 tsp.  ALL I can taste is bl pepper - and i still didn't add the entire amt called for - probably did 3/4.

I made a stove top version last Thanksgiving and it was huge hit!  I sprinkled a little parmesan and cheddar cheese on top and broiled for a minute.  Yum!
