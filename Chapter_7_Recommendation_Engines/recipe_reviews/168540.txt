Good shake! If you use frozen strawberries, blend them with the milk BEFORE you add the ice cream - otherwise your blender may stick like mine did. Pfft. I just had to add a little more milk to get things shaking. Thanks!

Great Shake,but instead of vanilla ice cream I added a little cherry and two packets of sugar great.
