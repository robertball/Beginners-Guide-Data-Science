I switch the order to cook the meat and cook the bacon first, then the sausage. I also use my homemade sausage and use two pounds instead of 1. Another way to boost flavor is to roast the cauliflower and add it at the very end instead of cooking for 5 minutes. We love this stuff.

Loved this! I follow a ketogenic lifestyle and this is perfect! The only change I made was to use heavy cream instead of half and half.  This makes huge portions, so I ended up slitting it into 8 portions (instead of 6) for lunches, and then put half in the freezer for easy meals.

This turned out really tasty! I added some herbs. I used spinach instead of kale and a little less cauliflower than it called for. I threw some mushrooms in too. Overall very good and I’ll be making this again. Thanks for the share

I made this exactly like the recipe and it is amazing! Make sure you use the spicy sausage. Tastes just like the Olive Garden version

Very good, easy too!  I used 1 1/2 lb Italian sausage w/giardinierre.  I used chopped fresh spinach, instead of kale.  I used a large head of cauliflower, chopped, and I didn't measure to see if it was 5 cups.  Too much cauliflower, next time I'll measure!  Thanks!

Yummy! Made it with part sweet and part hot sausages which gave it a great kick. Also roasted the cauliflower per someone's suggestion! Very very good.

I followed this recipe exactly. I felt the soup was a little thin and lacked flavor.
I will make the soup again, but will tweak the recipe to add more butter and heavy cream and add red pepper flakes for additional spice.

I use a whole bundle of swiss chard instead of kale. The texture is far better. I will use radishes in place of potatoes. My kiddo's actually now prefer radishes to potatoes in soups and roasts!

Great soup.  I didn't have cauliflower on hand, so used kale, 2 carrots, a couple of mini bell peppers and a bunch of mushrooms and half an onion.  I also subbed heavy whipping cream for the half-and-half.  We added both fresh grated parmesan and chopped avocado to our bowls.  Great low-carb meal!

I normally do not like to make changes to a recipe out of respect for the author, at least until I try it as intended, but this time I was a victim of circumstance and carelessness.  
First of all, The cauliflower at the store looked terrible, and there were no frozen florets so I ended up using frozen broccoli florets.  Next, I grabbed brats rather than italian sausage.  I made the soup anyway, and it turned out really good.  Next go around, I will use the correct ingredients.........

This was really good.  I added about a tsp of Italian seasoning. I cut the cauliflower in half and there was plenty in there!  Only 4 stars because I didn't like the way the bacon got soggy (I would leave it out next time) but my husband thought it was fine.

I doubled the meat since I have a family of boys. This made a lot more than 6 servings. My family loves this soup with the potatoes so we tried the low carb version and it was just as good.

Easy soup, and very tasty Added tarragon and the flavor suits the soup's mixture well.
