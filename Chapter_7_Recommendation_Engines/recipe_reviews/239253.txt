I made the mistake of halving this recipe and was I sorry. I think the wife and I could eat the full two pounds of shrimp in this recipe. These little lettuce wraps result in an explosion of flavor. I did marinate the shrimp for one hour.

This was excellent! I made it as written! I made the whole 2 lbs. for my husband and me. I served it for dinner and my husband was looking for more. Very flavorful making us want more. I think if I make it for dinner next time I will make more or get larger shrimp.

All enjoyed! Easy recipe with good flavor. I used spinach wraps vs lettuce and feta cheese vs Mexican cheese. I did marinate one hour per reviews. Baked at 400 for 8 min. (would decrease to 6-7 min next time).

Awesome tacos!!! This barely made enough for two adults and two kiddos in our family, double the recipe if you have big appetites, I made a side of veggie  mexican white rice. Marinated the shrimp for an hour and used my homemade queso fresco (recipe found on this site).Light, healthy and delicous!!!

I marinated for an hour. I could not find Queso Fresco in the market so I had to skip it. I also could not find butter lettuce with big leaves so I had to buy a package of torn leaves. I will say, first time for butter lettuce and LOVED it. Otherwise, made as directed. I put the shrimp on skewers on the grill and marinated again when I turned them over.

Holy cow!! just finished my second plate!! SOOOOOOO good! I didn't marinate it at all I just cooked it in a little olive oil and added butter for flavor then added Cajun seasoning, oj, and lime juice (not by recipe but rather just eye balled it) and garlic then cooked on medium low. Served it with cilantro tomatoes guacamole and mango salsa. highly recommended

This is an amazing recipe! Made it as an appetizer and my guests were looking around for more! I used olive oil and substituted shredded lettuce for the base.

We loved the marinade recipe and I used large pink shrimp.  I bought a 1/2 lb extra and we ate every bit of it.  I prefer to use coconut wraps  or romaine because it is sturdier.  I also made a coleslaw on the side and served it with a spicy teriyaki sauce to top it.  My kids said Mom best shrimp tacos or wraps we have ever had!

Didn't buy 4 heads of lettuce, just 2 and I added bell peppers to the shrimp. Loved it!

I made this and it was a hit. I substituted a few things in the recipe that I didn't have and it still came out amazing!!! I also paired with with some homemade Spanish Quinoa. YUM!

I didn't have a grill so saut√©ed the marinated shrimp in the stove and simmer in marinade after. Also cut up the lettuce into strips and made more of a salad out of it. Exquisite.

I actually cooked the shrimp with the marinade in a shallow pan. That way the onions and garlic were able to be eaten as well. it was easy and wonderful!

maybe better as a salad than a lettuce wrap because the shrimp just fell out of the lettuce, but the shrimp was bursting with flavor! :-)
