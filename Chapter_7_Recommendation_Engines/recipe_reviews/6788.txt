This is a foolproof recipe provided you just follow the steps, watch your measurements of flour, have good yeast, and keep the temp at least 65 degrees. For those who have had failures try weighing out your flour instead of measuring. NOTES FOR KITHEN AID MIXER USERS: Proof your yeast in the mixing bowl then add the oil/salt, the add the flour approx. 1 cup at a time with the dough hook on low speed. Once all the dry ingredients are in come up to medium speed for 5 minutes. Then take the dough out, fold it over on itself to redistribute the yeast, make a ball, and place it back in the same bowl after you drizzle a tablespoon of oil (veggie or olive) and turn the dough to coat evenly. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then a kitchen towel. There are a number of tricks if you think your kitchen is too cool. Turn your over on for 20 seconds and then right off. Put the dough in to rise. I set mine about 4 feet from the woodstove and turn it once. However, get it over 115 degrees and you'll kill the yeast. Just kneading it in the KA will increase the temp of the dough. And by the way, I have cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons and it is a classic farmhouse white bread. Hope this helps the few that are having trouble.

I love this bread! It's a bit dense, sweet and tastes good with butter. However, I am one of the few people who experienced difficulty with the recipe. It took me three tries to get it right. My yeast did not proof at all. Not having seen how yeast should react, I simply threw the loaf tin into the oven. The bread came out heavy and flat. The second time round, I experimented with warmer water, but after leaving it for an hour, it did not double in bulk at all. Concluding that it was the problem with the brand of yeast I used, I went out to get SAF-INSTANT and was rewarded! For novices who, like me, do not know what to look out for, the creamy white foam should resemble this: small tiny mini fireworks should sprout out in your mixing bowl. Leave it till you see foam protruding higher than the liquid level. The process should take about 10 minutes. And since I read that quite a few reviewers lessened the amount of sugar, I did not use the recommened amount of sugar. The elderly in the family appreciated the bread even more because of this.

I love this recipe and make it all the time.  If you follow directions, you will get a somewhat dense loaf that tastes a lot like Hawaiian sweet bread.  To make bread that tastes a lot more like regular white bread, I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.  This makes it much fluffier and less sweet.  Thanks again for the great recipe!

If I could give this recipe more stars I would!  This is by far the best white bread recipe I have ever tried.  Because it is a little sweet, I usually make one loaf of bread and do a round cake pan with cinnamon rolls with the other half of dough. Also, I always roll out my bread dough, whether I am making loaves or rolls to help get rid of excess air-bubbles, and this really helps.  To make the cinnamon buns just roll out, spread generously with butter and then sprinkle, (generously again - c'mon folks, no point in counting calories if you're making cinnamon buns! ;-) ), roll up and, using the string method, cut into about 9 rounds. Also, when making this recipe I use my Kitchen Aid - just follow basic directions except don't add all the flour at first, just add about 2/3 of what the recipe calls for and with the dough hook beat for about 2 minutes on speed 2.  Then continue adding flour, 1/2 cup at a time until mixture forms a ball on the hook and cleans the side of bowl. (about 2 more minutes.)  Then, continuing on speed 2 beat for another 2 mintues.  Turn into greased bowl and rise as directed in recipe.  Ta-da!  No kneading!

Great Versatile Bread
I've been making this for months.  Even my finnicky 2 yr old loves this 'toast' and it contains no preservatives.
GREAT WHITE BREAD:  I usually use 1/4 cup of sugar and 1.5 T of oil per loaf.  This is a very forgiving recipe. Always start out with a clean dry bowl. 
If you let it rise a bit more, the bread is very fluffy.   Since I let the dough rise more, I have too much dough for the loaf pan.  When I've finished the 2nd knead, I shape the loaf and cut off the two small ends of the dough and make 6 small dinner rolls (20 min baking).   
After baking, immediately remove from pan to prevent sogginess. 
DINNER ROLLS:  Shape into golf size balls, let rise and freeze individually,ziploc when frozen.   
CINNAMON ROLLS:  Great dough base, the other cinnamon roll doughs are FULL of butter.  Use the full amount of sugar.  Be sure to spray between rolls. For the filling, I use the clone of a cinnabun.  
ECONOMICAL:  I buy a pkg of 10lb bread flour from Smart and Final for $5.50.  That's 34 cups of flour.  I buy yeast from costco, a 2lb bag is around $3.50.  I give my mom half the bag.  Always be sure the yeast is fresh and refrigerated. 
STORAGE:  Storage and slicing is a negative aspect about homemade bread.  However, this bread keeps soft for 3-4 days. My hubbie got me a`breadstorage/slice guide for christmas from kingarthurflour.com and so far it's worked out well. 
Thank you for the recipe.

I HAVE TWO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS BREAD... SIMPLY DELICIOUS.  THIS IS THE BEST BREAD I HAVE EVER TASTED. I'VE BEEN BAKING BREAD FOR 8 YEARS NOW AND NONE OF THE BREADS I'VE MADE EVEN COMPARE TO THIS BREAD.  I READ MANY OF THE REVIEWS BEFORE BAKING THIS BREAD AND DECIDED TO CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR AND I'M GLAD I DID BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SWEET.  I USED 1/3 OF A CUP OF SUGAR AND IT CAME OUT PERFECTLY. I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE THIS BREAD AWAY AS GIFTS, THANKS SO MUCH PEG. ALSO THIS BREAD CAME OUT JUST FINE WITH ALL PURPOSE FLOUR.

OMG this bread is WRONG. I want to marry it and have a million of its babies. It's not often I make something exactly according to the recipe (I usually follow tips from other reviewers), but I followed this one exactly, and holy heck, I cannot stop eating it. And neither can my husband. Somebody go ahead and tape this bread to my rear end because that is exactly where it is going, and I don't even care because it is THAT GOOD.

Very easy to make. I was always so intimidated by bread recipies; not now! I roll the bread dough flat and sprinkle it with raisins, brown sugar and cinnamon, or asiago cheese. Then I roll it up and bake it. Wonderfull! Anyone can make this!

Arguably the best white bread recipe on the entire planet, and I should know. I've probably tried every last one! No faint praise, as I've been making bread for more than 35 years. I have made it exactly as written, and although it's very tasty with the full measure of sugar, we prefer cutting it slightly. I cut the recipe in half for my bread machine, and instead of 1/3 cup of sugar, I use 1/4 (which is to say 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon less per loaf.) There's still a hint of sweetness, but it's perfect for sandwiches and for mopping up gravy with savory entrees. I could tell even before it was baked that this was something wonderful; the dough was absolutely perfectly silken and smooth. The crust is just right with a nice delicate crispiness and the inside is light and moist. As long as you know your yeast is active (purchased recently or stored in the freezer/fridge and used before expiration) there is no need to proof. People seem to think that proofing makes the bread better. There is no magic in proofing. It won't improve your product. That step merely provides "proof" that the yeast is active, so that you don't waste good ingredients by adding them to dead yeast. In days gone by, when refrigeration was not all that common (or delivered by the ice man) it was necessary. Not so if you know you've handled the product correctly by storing in the fridge or freezer. Kudos for this superlative recipe! Update: Have made this about 7 times so far. Consistently wonderful resul

This did not live up to the hype or my expectations. It was too dense and too sweet.  Not a keeper.

SUPER EASY! This is my first time ever making bread and it came out perfect!  And it is beautiful. The first loaf was almost all eaten at dinner tonight. (And there are just 2 adults and 2 young kids)Thank you, my family actually thinks I can cook.  I may have to make this for Friday night dinner every week. ****Update - this is my staple recipe.  I make this at least once a week.  Sunday nithgt,I cook one and placde the other in the freezer before the second rise.  Mid-week, when we need a second loaf, I take the frozen dough out of the freezer before I leave for work and let it thaw in the loaf pan.  When I come home from work I just pop it in the oven and we have a hot loaf to eat with dinner!

I am a first time bread baker and I am walking on a cloud.  This is totally easy to make and turned out absolutely perfect.  I gave it an egg white wash before baking and it looked wonderful.  Thanks so much for sharing Peg.

This is a fun recipe. My husband likes to make this bread and it usually turns out pretty good but needs to cook a little longer. We keep forgetting the suggestion to lower the sugar amount for a fluffier type bread. Hope that works. We'll see.

No wonder this is rates so highly. I made this last night and it turned out great! I live in high altitude and some recipes work without the tweaks and some don't and this one worked without any changes. I halved the recipe since I didn't want two wasted loaves if it didn't work out.  Nice and tender dough and slightly dense which is like most of the orowheat or the like breads, not like webers or the cheaper stuff. Perfect consistancy for our tastes.This is a great recipe! UPDATE: Ok so since my first time making bread with this recipe I've come across some things that help. Different weather does different things to your dough so don't feel like you need to use the exact amount of flour listed, I've used more and some times slightly less; just depends on how dry the flour is and how humid it is outside. I've come to realize that the sugar content is what gives you the dark crust...lol...so if you use less the crust will be lighter, unless you use an egg wash. Ok so I love this bread and love fresh baked bread. To par-bake (finish baking when you want it) Just bake for 75% of the time or 22 min. Take out and remove from pan to cool completely. Wrap and freeze until wanted. Take out and bake from frozen at 350 for the remainder and sometimes 2 min longer. Pefect! Works for other bread recipes as well (Rolls...fresh for dinner without the work that day :) )

I'm already on my second batch in 3 days.  Family loves it and so do I.  Not too sweet for me, but that's just a personal preference.  Rises nice and high... I don't think you can mess this one up.  Suggestions to those of you who aren't getting the right rise- get yourself an instant read thermometer (doesn't have to be digital).  Stick the thermometer into the water as it's coming out of the faucet- try to adjust your water until the thermometer reads 110-115 degrees.  Dissolve the sugar in the water first (which also feeds the yeast and gets it going)then let it stand for 10 minutes.  If it doesn't look foamy, throw it out and start over.  Also, check the date on your yeast.  Don't use old stuff.  You work too hard to ruin your bread with outdated yeast.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe.  Can't wait to try it for rolls and raisin bread.  It makes great bread pudding if it actually lasts long enough to dry out and become stale.

I have to make a comment about something breadguy said when using a KitchenAid for mixing this dough.  He said to use the dough hook, mix on low speed then increase speed to medium for 5 minutes.
On the KitchenAid there is 10 speeds.  Everything written about using the dough hook says "do not use a speed higher than #2 when using the dough hook.  Perhaps BreadGuy made a mistake here.  This is a heavy dough and when I set the speed to #5 just to see, it threw this dough all over the place.

I set the speed to #2 as per KA instructions and kneaded the dough for 4 minutes and it was fine. Also took 45 minutes to rise 1" above pan.  Rose beautifully when cooking.  I used Bread Flour as suggested.  Much nicer, high rise.

I used 1/3 cup of sugar as some had suggested.  Only ate the crust so far but usually the crust isn't too great but this was.  I often go by the weight of the finished product.  If it feels heavy when I pick up the uncut loaf, it is usually a heavy bread.  This feels nice and light to me.
Thanks greatly to the poster.
My 9th recipe try and so far my favourite.

This is my main bread recipe. I make this every Sunday. The trick I found to a nice, big loaf is to make the dough Sunday morning and let it rise when we're away at church for several hours. When we get home, I punch the dough down, knead and place in the loaf pans to allow it to rise again. I also allow another 1 and a half or so, but I like my breads to be fairly big so I let it rise for most of the day. The dough rises fairly quickly and the bread turns out fabulous! I also brush an egg white & water glaze to the crust before baking. The loaves come out wonderful and just the right brown color. Great texture and flavor. I do not change a thing.

This recipe turns out wonderful. Some Reviewers thought it was sweet, but I thought it was fine. I thought they were exaggerating. If I don't have bread flour, I substitute it with All Purpose Flour. I've made it a few times and will continue to do so. This is how I make it: 1) Get a large pot, heat the water to warm & let sugar dissolve. Once it's lukewarm, sprinkle in yeast & gently stir once. Let it get foamy for 13-15MIN (I turn on the oven @ 350 for 1MIN, turn it off, & then place the pot of yeast mixture inside to rest. That way it's in a warm environment). 2) Mix salt & oil into yeast. Mix in 3 cups of flour, stir, then add remaining flour. 3) Knead dough INSIDE the pot until smooth, about 6-8MIN. It's not difficult to knead in the pot. It's quick, easy, and less messy. My counter and laziness thanks me :) 4) Oil the pot, coat the dough, cover w/ plastic. 5) Turn on oven @ 350 for 1MIN to create a warm environment. Turn it off, and then place the pot of dough inside. Let rise for 1 HR as directions say. 6) After the 1st rise, punch down dough, turn on oven again @ 350 for 1MIN, turn it off, and place the loaves inside to rise for 30MIN as recipe states. Right before I bake them, I brush melted butter over the tops. I bake them exactly for 31MINS. I love this bread. Thank you so much for posting it. If I just need 1 loaf, I halve the recipe and do it the same way as I described. It's delicious. :)

I made this bread for the first time today. My kids were jumping up and down, begging for more. I'm sold. Anything that gets my picky little beggars to act like that gets my vote.

This bread was AMAZING. I've made bread in the past but had a hard time getting the heavier flours like wheat to rise as high as I'd like. This recipe was really easy to follow and a quick make (as far as bread goes). It's just slightly sweet and very tender with the crust being just on the brink of chewy.   My only modification would be to only add about 5 cups of flour initially and reserve the 6th cup for while your kneading. I'm definitely keeping this in my recipe book from now on. Thank you!

Exceptionally good bread - a real 5-star recipe!  I've been making bread for 35 years and this had the best flavor/texture combination of any recipe I've used.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, and the flavor was rich but not sweet.  I will make the bread with the full 2/3 cups today since this recipe deserves a real taste-test.  One note to novice bread bakers:  never follow a bread recipe's instructions for the amount of flour.  Add flour in increments until the dough can be easily handled and then stop.  A lot depends on the type of flour you use and the weather.  I used all-purpose flour for this recipe and needed a little less than 5 1/2 cups of flour instead of 6.

Delicious!!  I live near Ohio's Amish country, and this bread tastes authentic.  I mix mine in the bread machine on "dough" setting, place it in a greased bread pan, let raise 30 min, then bake at 350 for about a half hour, til browned on top.  YUMMMMMM!

I love this recipe. I've made it a couple of times; most recently on Canadian Thanksgiving. Only this time, I cut the sugar in half and made two dozen rolls out of it. I let the rolls rise on a cookie sheet in the fridge over night, and they were soo full the next morning. I brushed them with a bit of eggwash, popped them in the oven for 20 minutes and they came out perfect. Everybody raved, and now my mom wants me to turn half the recipe into rolls every time I make this bread.

I'm still in awe that I can actually bake bread! I agree with everyone who has banned store bought bread from their kitchens! My loaves were lightly crunchy and slighty browned on the outside and wonderfully soft in the center!

This was a great recipe.  If you want it a little richer, you can use 1 cup water and 1 cup lowfat milk.  It makes the crumb finer and softer and the crust browner.  Thanks. Update:  I have been making this bread for a couple of years now.  It is just so wonderful.  If you like it sweet, keep the sugar as is.  Less sweet, just reduce the sugar.  I have also taken to adding an egg to the dough while mixing.  It seems to make the bread even more tender.  Sometimes I use my KitchenAid, but most times I just do it by hand.  A good 10 minutes if by hand.  1 1/2 tbsp of yeast is a lot.  My bread rises very high (I had to remove the rack above them...LOL).  If your bread didn't rise, then either your yeast was dead or the water you used was too hot.  This is virtually goof-proof.  And I have become famous in my neighborhood since I usually give one of the loaves away to a neighbor (to prevent me from eating BOTH of them!!!).  Who doesn't love a warm, fresh-from-the-oven loaf of bread?  Make friends with this one!!! If you are new to baking bread, certainly try this recipe.

I have been using this recipe for years, and now that I am 13 I finally was able to sign up. I now have this recipe memorized! Although 6 cups is a good starting point of the flour measurement, I never measure the flour. Using my KitchenAid mixer, I simply add in the flour approximately 1-2 cups at a time, mixing well after each addition, until the dough forms a sticky ball around the bread hook attachment. I have found that this is a wonderful recipe for both dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls. Also, it adds a nice flavor and glossy top if you brush the loaves with melted butter after baking. Thank you for this no-fail recipe!

I've read so many reviews on how great this bread is and I'm determined to make mine great but it just doesn't happen.  I've tried making it 3 times and it always turns out heavy, wet, dense, small and has to be tossed.  Don't know what I'm doing wrong.

One of my first attempts at making bread - very easy to make, turned out fantastically, although I had to alter some things (rising and baking time) because I live in a very humid location. It was very popular at Thanksgiving dinner, and specifically requested by a friend for Christmas dinner.  Very sweet, works best as a table-bread.

Wonderful bread! Converts well to bread machine. (I use the dough setting, divide and bake in two loaves.) I halved the sugar, substituted 2 cups of white flour with 2 cups of whole wheat for the family's taste. I found a website online that converts weight into cups (5 lbs bread flour = 16.333 cups, etc) and figured this bread costs 78 cents a loaf to make, not including electricity. Yes, I was bored that day...

WOW! This was my very first time baking bread & It was EASY, FUN & came out PERFECT. I took some advise and used only 1/4 cup sugar. I also opted to use light olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. The best advice I took was to be patient and let the yeast foam up real good. Make sure the water for the yeast and sugar is warm enough, about as warm as you would make a baby bottle. Be patient with the yeast! If it looks foamy and smells like bread it is active. I also followed a great suggestion to help my dough rise by putting a pre-boiled, large pot of water in the oven (oven turned off) with the oven light on to make sure it had a good rise since it was pretty cold here in Wisconsin. I used a clean spray bottle with regular water to mist the loafs every 10 mins, this gave my bread a nice color and ensured no burning =) My kids and hubby loved it! MAKE THIS BREAD! even if it is your first time, it won't be your last. Good luck.

My family really enjoys this bread recipe. When I first made it my family was really impressed with the great flavor from such simple ingredients. The key is to make sure that your yeast-sugar mixture is foamy.  My sister and I found that the mixture is ready after about ten minutes and it also exudes an alcohol smell, due to fermentation.  Also allow the bread plenty of time to rise. If you rush the rising time (i.e. don't let it rise for the full time) you'll have much less flavor in the end. Now two things that I have done differently with this recipe is to use all-purpose flour, instead of bread flour, and I also used rapid-rise yeast, as opposed to the regular yeast. No matter which you use, this bread is still quite delicious. My sister also wanted me to say that this makes good sandwiches as well. The key for this to be sandwich bread is to make sure it cools all the way. If not it will simply fall apart. This is another great recipe from this site to add to my recipe box. Thank you very much, Peg.

I have been dying to try my hand at bread making and this recipe is exactly what I was looking for! Easy and delicious! I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and 5 cups of bread flour and it was exactly what I wanted! Mine didn't rise above the pans though and after reading more reviews I will be using 2 tbsp of yeast from now on. Love, love this recipe! My house smells amazing and my daughter couldn't stop eating it! Fluffy deliciousness! Thanks for sharing!

This bread was absolutely fantastic.  I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaid stand mixer and let it knead in there for 3-4 minutes instead of kneading it by hand.  Also, for the rising, I followed Alton Brown's suggestion of pouring boiling water into a shallow baking dish placed in the bottom of a cold oven, and placing the dough in the makeshift "proofing box".  The bread came out with a wonderfully smooth and light texture, not at all dense and crumbly like typical homemade bread.

The other day I was looking for a white bread mix to make cinnamon rolls.  I found this recipe by mistake.  I found this bread easy to make and wonderfully sweet and delicious for anything from regular white bread to cinnamon rolls. This bread also stays softer longer then other bread recepies I have tried in the past(even my mother's).

I'm not new at breadmaking, but I have to say this is the best recepie I've EVER seen for making bread. I'm going to try adding more yeast to the other recepies... maybe that's why the others turn out so heavy.... In any case, I've used both "best for bread" and "all purpose" flours, and they both turn out equally wonderful. I've taken to doubling the recepie and putting it into three, not four, loaf pans, and got taller bread, more like what you find in the store. 

This bread is a light, fluffy loaf similar to storebought bread, except that it's sweeter. I saw the review that said less sugar and more salt... I'll try that next time. 

It's great for people on a seriously tight budget too: flour, oil, yeast, sugar, salt... who doesn't have all those ingredients in their kitchen? And most food pantries will give mostly flour and sugar. Salt and oil are cheap, and I've found a cheap yeast that works wonderfully... it's called saf-instant.

Alright, enough of my prattling... it's good! try it!

I'm not sure what happened.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and found the bread to be too dense, tough and it hardly rose.  Maybe I didn't let the yeast proof enough?  Any hints?

This turned out very good...I made mine into one loaf of cinnamon/sugar bread and 8 large sandwich rolls.  The rolls are pretty good (I think they'll be better when actually made into sandwiches) and the cinnamon/sugar bread is outstanding.  I took half the dough after the first rise, rolled it out into a rectangle, sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar, and rolled it up -- similar to if you were making cinnamon rolls, except I didn't roll the dough out that thin.  Then I put the rolled up dough log in a loaf pan, brushed it with an eggwash and baked it.  After it was done baking and cooled a bit, I made a glaze out of butter, powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract, and drizzled it over the top of the loaf.  It's exactly like a cinnamon swirl bread I used to get at a very good bakery in my hometown, which I haven't had in years so it was a very delicious treat with our dinner tonight.

This bread is wonderful and super easy to make even for a bread novice like myself. My loaves were a bit heavy but I attribute that to the chef...lol. My kids thought it was fantastic with my home-made cinnamon honey butter. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not normally a white bread fan, but I LOVE this recipe.  It's super easy and the bread turns out delicious.  I rolled cinnamon/sugar and raisins in one loaf, and I will continue to experiment by rolling chocolate chips, pie filling, nuts and dried fruits, into the bread before the final rise.  (Just flatten dough, sprinkle on topping of choice, roll up, and place in loaf pan as you normally would.)   Great basic recipe.

Like most others, I found this recipe excellent. I wanted to experiment with freezing it in both loaf and roll forms, so I froze it, after the first rise and after shaping how I wanted, by putting it in the pan it would eventually bake in, covering with slightly oiled plastic wrap, put it in the freezer. After it was completely frozen, I removed it from the pan and wrapped it completely.  I thawed it out overnight before the day I wanted to bake it, put it back in the original pan and let it rise for the second time. It did take a bit of extra time to rise, but - OH MY! - it turned out fantastic. I am going to make it in loaf and roll form and freeze it for Thanksgiving so I can have fresh yeast rolls on that day! Thanks for the great recipe!

Bread flour?  I didn't know what that was. So, I used All Purpose Flour.  Followed the recipe, Tripled it.  Gave out loaves to my neighbors, and co-workers.  They all raved about it.  One said he sliced 3 pieces, nuked it in the mircowave, and then added butter to it.  He said it was so delicious.  He wants the recipe to give to his mom.

I have always been afraid to make bread, but this recipe was easy and fun.
We are considered "high altitude" and I was wondering about adjustments to the recipe.  It came out really nice, I am just not sure I am going to be able to slice it for sandwiches.  I would suggest to anyone to let it cool COMPLETELY before cutting it, because the loaf gets really squashed if you try to eat it too fast.
I made cinnamon bread with one of the loaves.  I took half of the dough and cut it by half again.  I rolled out each half and spread it with butter, cinnamon and brown sugar.  I put one half on top of the other and rolled them together, shaping and rolling into one loaf.  I let it rise in the loaf pan and cooked it the same way.  It took a little longer to rise.
UPDATE******A few more TIPS:
*Make sure you let the bread rise completely.  Mine took over an hour for the second rise.  Just because bread is taking awhile to rise, doesn't mean anything is wrong and it actually gives it more flavor
*The dough should be elastic when you are done kneading.
*You don't have to beat the bread when you are punching it down, just deflate.
(Just a couple things I have learned from making this bread :)

Wow, what a great bread! This turned out absolutely wonderful! I too think it may be a little too sweet for most sammies, but my kids are loving the pb&j on it! It also tastes great all by itself! Thanks for the great recipe, I will definately make this again! *UPDATE* I have been making this so much and I have found that using only 1/3 cup sugar makes it perfect sandwich bread! Love this bread!

I first made this bread about 6 weeks ago.  I have not bought a loaf since.  I cut the recipe in half as there is only 2 of us and always use 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white.  Hubby loves it!

I wanted to add a couple things to my review.  First of all you can make this any way you want all white, part white/wheat, AP flour or bread flour.  I do recommend bread flour for the white.   I was having a problem getting this out of the pan.  Especially if I let it rise a lot.  Grease your pans with shortening not oil and you will be happier.  If the bread has not risen to  your liking walk away.  You can't hurt it!  Everyone loves it no matter how I make it!  As recommended by other users I always brush the top with melted butter and I let it rise in my oven with the light on!

I walk right past the bread isle at the grocery store! This is so easy and tastes better than any store brand. If you want it less dense, use just a touch less flour. I substitute sugar with honey and it makes it so much better. Somehow the honey works it's way into the crust and makes it look beautiful too. I have recently started adding a tbsp. of brown sugar to the dough as well. P.S. Remember to use UNbleached flour & keep your family safe & healthy! THANKS!

As a yeast novice, I thought I screwed up several times and it still melted in my mouth.  I mixed the sugar and two packets of yeast and added the water and let it set for 20 minutes. Mixed in the other wet ingredients, then the dry (used all-purpose flour) 1 C. at a time with my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  The dough was uber-sticky so I scraped it into the oiled bowl.  I'm not a kneady person so I barely did any after the first rise, yet it worked.  Gotta love an easy, bulletproof and oh-so tasty recipe.  UPDATE:  I screwed up the second time around and only used 4 cups flour.  I didn't add the rest until after the first rise and it STILL came out great.

I cut the sugar to half as others suggested and it was still sweet and very tasty. I wanted to make bread to make sandwiches, but we ate the bread plain, it was so good! I definately recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a nice white bread, and I can't wait to try it with 1/2 wheat flour, too! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I've been trying to make a good, fluffy white bread for the past 9 years.  I finally gave up thinking I just didn't have the skill.  Well, my husband wanted me to try again (we can't get good white bread here in Siberia).  So, I thought I would try this one.  The only change I made was that I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  After kneading for about 10 minutes I let it rise not once but 3 times.  After about 45 minutes I punched it down and let it rise again for another hour.  Then I put it in the pans and let it rise again for another hour.  WOW!  The most beautiful, fluffy white bread I've ever seen.  Thank you.

Excellent homemade white bread recipe!  Just like Butternut/Wonderbread (only better) as another reviewer said.  I wanted to use my breadmaker to make it easier on me, so I just cut the recipe ingredients exactly in half so it would make one 2 lb. loaf.  After that, disregard all of the steps in the recipe - just load the ingredients into your breadmaker pan in the usual required order:  wet ingredients first, then dry ingredients, then yeast on top so it's not touching the wet. Set your machine to the White Bread 2 lb Loaf menu setting (I chose "Light" crust and it turned out great) and you're ready to go.  So, so easy!  Excellent as sandwich bread or as buttered toast!

This is a simple recipe that is delicious to eat, with or without butter!!    I grew up making and eatg this bread, not as a loaf bread, but rather as a sweet bread, roll it flat, pinch into little 2inch rolls, fill each with a pat of butter, a sprinkle each of brown sugar and cinnamon, bake until done, drizzle while still warm with icing, any kind is yummy.   This is an easy enough recip for beginners and children, the wet towel is needed in the north and abslutely a must in the dry west, but if you are in the south, a dry towel will do, also, to let it rise, place in the oven, with the light on.

PERFECT for making cinnamon rolls, as well.  I split the recipe in half, as directed, and made one large loaf of bread, and two nine inch round pans of cinnamon rolls (roll out dough, melt 1/2 stick real butter, spread on rolled dough, sprinkle with 1/2 C. cinnamon/sugar mixture, cut and bake for 20 mins.).  My family said it was the best bread I ever made, and the moistest cinnamon rolls ever.

Just a few tips when making any kind of bread...
Don't take out all of the sugar, because sugar is food for the yeast, and it will rise very slow if at all without it. Also, I find it in very good habit to not put any salt in direct contact with yeast.  Salt hinders yeast activity, and can even kill the yeast before it even gets a chance to ferment.  So for this recipe, I added the salt at the very end, after the flour.  It's just a little insurance.  Also, be sure that the dough is mixed long enough.  The gluten formation is crucial to the dough, because if the gluten strands are too weak, the carbon dioxide that the yeast gives off will tear them and cause no air pockets, making the dough stay flat and very dense.

Hope this helps when making any sort of bread!  Happy baking!!

-Kristy

Absolutely fabulous!  I bake a lot of bread, and this is by far one of the best recipes I've found.  I heeded the advice of others and cut the sugar - one heaping third of a cup.  I also used the bread hook on my KitchenAid stand mixer to knead the dough and made half the recipe into rolls.  To do this, pull off chunks of dough and roll into balls about 3 inches across.  Pinch seams to bottom and place on a greased and floured cookie sheet.  They require 5-10 minutes less cooking time this way, so keep your eye on them.  My father raved over them, and he's a hard man to please when it comes to cooking.

This is a fantastic recipe, especially good for beginners.  It is reliable and turns out wonderfully time after time.  I had my boyfriend, who has very little experience making bread, try making the recipe  by himself and the bread came out great.  It's also good to use half whole wheat flour and half white flour if you want a slightly healthier bread.

Making this bread was the 1st time I had ever made a bread that actually called for yeast. Let me tell you this turned out awesome. VERY easy to make and tasted absolutely wonderful. I looked at numerous bread recipes on this site before I came across this one. The other recipes seemed too complicated or took too long to make. This one was perfect though. Thank you for submitting it!

This was my first time making bread. I made this last weekend, and even though I screwed up the whole thing the flavor was so good my teenaged son and one of my nephews liked it so much they wanted me to make it again. Last time I killed the yeast by using too hot water; the texture of the finished bread was like that of a bagel but the flavor was great. I'm making it again this weekend, right now as a matter of fact, and will update when it's done. If you don't have a thermometer at hand, use this tip I picked up from ehow-dot-com: "The water should feel like a pleasantly warm shower, or about the temperature you'd use for a baby's bottle. If it feels uncomfortably hot, it will probably kill the yeast."

This is a fabulous bread recipe!  The crust is firm but not dry.  The interior is smooth and soft with an even texture.  I made the recipe with 1/3 C. sugar and it is great.  I also used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix the dough.  Just keep it on level 1 until all of your flour is added, then kick it up to about level 4 for a minute, just until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough looks smooth and all together.  For the second rise I put half in a bread pan and divided the other half into 12 dough balls and baked in a muffin tin for rolls.  Perfect!  If you are using the little yeast packets, use 2 of the 1/4 ounce packets (I used Fleischmann's).  Thanks, Peg!

This recipe makes a fantastic white bread.  I followed the tip from EDNKIRSTIN and reduced the sugar to 1/4 Cup.  It turned out light fuffy and moist.  I also put a pan of hot water in the oven while it was raising and when I baked it.  It is by far the best white bread I have ever made.

This is the third time I have made bread, this recipe is very simple and easy to follow.  Although it was way to sweet for my liking.  I also used AP flour in place of bread flour and it turned out fine. If I make this again I would cut way back on the sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this five stars b/c the bread itself is amazing and easy. however, if you are using regular active dry yeast and NOT a rapid rise kind, the rise time needs to to be increased. Otherwise you will get a denser bread. I've found 3 hrs for the first rise and 1 hr 15 min for the second. It is definitely worth the extra time!

Truly great recipe. My family has gotten spoiled by this bread.  Here is a tip for the people who have trouble with it not rising right.  My clothes dryer is in my kitchen so I just set the dough on top of the dryer with a tea towel draped over the top.  Not only is it warm and humid, but I can do my laundry at the same time.  When the timer goes off on the dryer, it is time to punch down the dough.  Works every time.

This was wonnnnnderful... I halved the recipe since I only have one loaf pan. It comes out looking exactly like the picture - fluffy, slightly dense texture. It was a little bit crumbly, but not so much that it fell apart. The bread is wonderful to eat by itself or with spreads/toppings. Next time, I'll decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup so it'll be good for sandwiches. This was my first time making bread and I was so excited that it came out! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I am a student living on my own for the first time.  I have recently discovered the joys of cooking.  Since I've been away, I have been trying various bread methods and recipes.  Hands down... this is the best one.  If  a starving student can do it, anyone can.  I read the suggestions beforehand and only used half of the sugar suggested.  This was a fantastic idea.  The bread turns out delivious and fluffy... A++.  Give it a try.

This bread is DELICIOUS. This is the first time I've gotten bread to work for me, and it was well worth it. I ended up having to throw the dough in the fridge for the first rise, as I had to run to a forgotten rehearsal. When I pulled it out about an hour and a half later, it was perfectly risen to just double it's bulk. I punched down, panned it, and let it rise for about an hour, and it rose again beautifully (which is always the downfall step for me). It is sweet, dense and wonderful! Not a sandwich bread, but utterly delicious! I think I will make french toast with it tomorrow morning!

This is my "Go To" white bread recipe.   I make 3 or 4 loaves a week for my family.  I also roll the dough out to about 1/2" thick and spread melted butter, sugar and raisins, then roll it up.  I've been baking bread for 40 years and this is the best basic bread recipe.  So much you can do with this dough.  Sometimes I add a little more salt and less sugar or honey.  Sometimes I put the water, yeast, sugar or honey plus one cup of the flour in to the mixer and mix it, then leave it for 20-30 minutes until doubled.  I will then add 1 tsp more yeast, the oil, salt and flour, mix and let it sit another 20 min.  I take it out onto my counter and knead until smooth, then follow the rest of the directions.

Freaking AMAZING!!!  I let my Kitchenaid mixer do all the work.  I let the yeast activate in the bowl, then put the paddle attachment on and mixed in the rest of the ingredients (I used all 6 cups of flour).  Once incorporated, I switched to the dough hook and let it work the dough until it formed a ball.  It was so easy! I brushed the tops of the loaves with buttermilk and they came out golden brown and beautiful! My loaves baked 3 minutes shy of the total 30 minutes.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

After reading all the raving reviews I was very excited to try this bread. I made 1 loaf and 8 dinner rolls. I should have listened to the other reviewers and reduced the sugar but I like to try the recipe as written the first time. This bread was WAY to sweet... almost tastes like cake! I will try it again, but reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. I gave it three stars because of it's ease to make but based soley on taste, I wouldn't give it more than 2.

A couple of tips:
- Reduce the sugar unless you really like sweet (really sweet) bread.
- I only used 5 cups of flour, any more and it would have been to dense (the loaf is already a dense bread).
- Bake a little longer than indicated or it will be a little raw on the inside (5 minutes did it for me).
******************************************Update --- I have been making this bread for the past little bit by using only 1/4 cup of sugar and the the items I've indicated above... We have stopped purchasing bread from the store because this is so easy, yummy, and sans-preservative :)... (When I say easy, I mean easy... I work full time and have my 2 year old son all evening to myself while my hubby is at work and I have time to make two loafs and clean up!)  Enjoy!!

This is a fabulous recipe.  We like whole wheat bread so I replace two cups of white flour with two cups of whole wheat flour.  I sometimes have trouble proofing my yeast but I found a fool proof method.  I set my large metal mixing bowl in a few inches of warm water in the sink and then I 
mix my warm water, sugar and yeast.  In about ten min. I always get a perfect proof.  I am new at this bread making and this recipe makes me a pro.

This recipe is by far THE best recipe out there for bread.  I use my Kitchenaid mixer on it but have also made this with very young family members to let them do karate chops and punches into the dough.  I usually end up making it into cinnamon rolls where I roll it out and spread butter on it, coat it with brown sugar, sprinkle cinnamon and dash a touch of nutmeg on it.  I then let it rise again and cook it at 375.  I mix up some cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk and frost the tops of the rolls with it.  I get rave reviews each time. This also works really well to make bread bowls or buns with it.  Melt some butter, add some parmesan and garlic salt to it and coat the rolls/breadbowls with it, let it rise and bake it at 375 until golden brown.  Such a GREAT recipe!

This was very easy and quick to make. I used regular baking flour. (I never use bread flour when baking bread, and have never had a problem.) Used my kitchen aid mixer. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup additional flour as I kneaded the dough.  Next time I may make 3 smaller loaves, instead of 2 large loaves.... they were pretty big.  Husband and kids enjoyed this.

I use pretty much the same method as breadguy. But I add my salt later with the flour additions. Also, I use quick rise yeast and add 1 TB vital wheat gluten to the flour additions. (Vital wheat gluten helps improve the rise and texture of bread)
Some tips for telling when your dough is kneaded sufficiently, is the dough should feel slightly tacky - like the back of a “Post-It-Note”, and forms “blisters” under the surface of the dough. With this recipe, I let it rise twice in the bowl. The extra dough rising allows the bread to develop flavor. Peg, this recipe is great! Thanks so much for sharing it!

Let me start by saying I stink at baking...I ruin bread machine recipes, so I was warey trying this one.  I used my Kitchenaid stand up mixer for all the mixing.  No kidding, this is the greatest and easiest bread recipe ever.  The loaves came out perfect...looked professionally baked..better than the stuff at the supermarket! My kids go wild for the bread which is soft, sweet, and perfect for everything!  It is great for sandwhiches, toast, and dipping into hot soup.  Now my kids want me to make this bread only and NEVER buy bread again.

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner.  It was the HIT of the dinner!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I made four mini loaves instead of two regular sized loaves.  It cooked for about 25 minutes instead of 30.  It is very moist, fluffy, and just slightly sweet.  My husband and children just raved and ate one whole mini-loaf between the three of them!!  Definite keeper and do again!  Thank you!!!

Addendum - I made this a second time using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white bread flour.  It is (in my opinion) even BETTER!  I didn't think that was possible!  Absolutely delicious.

Love, love, love this.  I make this weekly, and when I serve it to someone who has never had it, they always RAVE over it. I usually have to let it rise a little longer than directed, but it's worth it.  Sometimes I throw in a little wheat flour and this works well, too.   Perfect bread!!
EDIT: I wanted to try this in the breadmachine so that I could cut out one of the kneadings.  I let the water, sugar, and yeast proof in the breadmachine (without starting it), added oil, salt, and flour, and then set the machine to the dough setting.  After that is done, I pull the dough out, shape it into two loaves, and let it have it's second rising in loaf pans.  Then I bake them in the oven as directed.  My breadmachine does not make good shaped loaves, so I prefer the loaf pans in the oven, but the machine does a great job with all the mixing and kneading--really makes this recipe easier, if that's possible!

As I type this I am savoring a warm slice, fresh from the oven, of this bread.  The other reviews were right - this is delicious!  I did make a few changes that I want to note for others who might be health concious.  I substituted "Splenda for Baking" instead of the sugar. This meant I only used 1/3 c. instead of the 2/3 listed in the recipe.  I also used that new, "healthier" Enova oil instead of regular vegetable.  These changes didn't seem to change the texture or the flavor of this wonderful bread.  I will be making this one often!  It's a definite keeper!  THANKS!!!

Fantastic recipe. Will definately sell my breadmaker as this recipe makes two good sized loaves and they are perfect! Also they have none of the "bad" ingredients of commercial bread. I found the bread perfect for every use I have including sandwiches (not crumbly at all). May I offer some suggestions to correct the problems other people have had. Did you convert the recipe to suit the measurements you use. eg I live in New Zealand and US measurements are quite different from ours here. We use metric.When cup measurements are converted into metric instead of imperial 6 cups of flour becomes 5 1/2 cups plus 1 tbsp and  dsp. The sugar changes to 1/2 cup plus 3 dsps white sugar. The tsps and tbsp meaurements remain the same. Another important tip is that the flour MUST be added 1 cup at a time stirring with a wooden spoon between each addition. When the loaves come out of the oven spray them immediately with a butter mist (bought in a aerosol can over here).  One last tip, at the stage that you punch down the bread the bread can be put into the fridge overnight (covered)for baking the next day. You will need to punch it down again and knead for 2 minutes then put into tins and let it rise for 30 minutes then bake it.

This bread was the first I ever made from scratch, and it is wonderful.  I was nervous about trying it, but this recipe never fails.  Normally I halve the recipe for just one loaf.  It is a great base for all sorts of experiments.  You can use wheat flour, add honey and cinnamon for a delicious toast, and I even make rolls out of it sometimes.  Try it and impress your friends and family by saying, "it's homemade."  :)

This was not extremely impressing for me and I probably will make again sometime, though because it served as a delicious sandwich bread.  For people who are reading this, if you want sandwich bread, this is for you.

This is a wonderful bread. Great texture and flavor, and slices so easily (also makes delicious toast!). I used my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook to incorporate all of the flour. I had to let the bread rise for about an hour on the second rise to get it high enough. It was worth the wait because the result was one of the most beautiful loaves of yeast bread I've ever made!

Super simple!  I used 3 cups all-purpose flour and 3 cups whole wheat flour and decreased the sugar to just over 1/3 c. (reading other reviews) and it is delicious!  Can't wait to make this again and do cinnamon bread or rolls.  And this was only my third time making homemade bread and this is the best of them so far.

I know this recipe doesn't really need anymore stars but I could not resist a review. This was the very first time I have ever made bread and mine turned out perfectly. I don't think it was too sweet, but I am a novice. I also used all purpose flour because I didn't have any bread flour. I think it turned out really well. My husband also thought it was very good.

I have used this recipe for years, after having gotten it off of All Recipes.
I split the ingredients in half, making only one loaf, and use my Kitchen Aid mixer with the bread hook to mix, and knead. This bread is my go to recipe, a nice compliment to a meal, and has never failed me. My husband loves it when I make this homemade bread!

I made this bread today - I followed the recipe except I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup as per suggestions by other raters.  I followed breadguy's suggestions for using a kitchen aid mixer and the bread came out beautiful.  A little crusty on the outside and soft and fragrent on the inside.  As another rater said, this has real possibilities as cinnamon rolls.  I'll try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe Peg!

Ok, after reading other reviews that suggested this would be a great cinnamon roll dough (of which I have been looking for a good one for years) I decided to give 'er a go.  OHMYGOSH!!  Finally  I have found MY Cinnamon roll recipe.  Followed recipe exactly using all the sugar, etc.  When they were in the pan I let them really rise again.  Then little trick.  Cook them in a not preheated oven for the same amount of time and they will raise even more while cooking.  Used another recipe on here "Clone of a Cinnabon" for the filling and icing.  They were to die for and they stayed soft..not just out of the oven.  THANK YOU Peg!!  My search is now over.  LOL

I started making this, then realized it called for "bread flour". I went ahead and used my all purpose flour, delicious! Best bread I've made by far! Thanks!

great bread/rolls, I got one nice loaf and 10 rolls. Fluffy and nice textured but also made great toast. Would be a super roll for hamburgers.

A definite must for the beginner bread maker!  This bread was exceptionally easy. I reduced the sugar to 1/3c (as suggested by others) and included an egg in the batter. I had two large beautiful loaves of bread with tiny perfectly formed air holes. When cut while warm the crust was light and flaky, reminded me of a croissant.  I spread butter on top of it while still warm and when it cooled, it was nice and soft with a buttery flavor.  Store bought bread doesn't compare to this. I snapped up pictures but haven't had a chance to download. Even my son, who is the pickiest of eaters enjoyed it. I'm going to make this bread again next week, but this time I'll use the full 2/3 c sugar as suggested (I like sweet bread) and use milk instead of water.  I'll post my results.

I've been making this bread weekly for about 4 months. It is great, but I've incorporated a few changes for our tastes.  The bread is quite sweet, so I took the sugar down to 1/4 c.  I also add 1 small egg and use 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. melted butter.  It gives the bread a boost of flavor.  This is the only bread my family eats right now (sandwiches, toast, etc.)  I make 3 loaves on Sat. I butter the loaves on the outside crust right out of the oven, let them cool, slice, put two in ziplock gallon freezer bags (just re-use them over and over), push out all the air and take them out every 2 days.  It works for us.  Be careful about putting too much flour in.  And I use my Kitchen aid mixer.  Fast and easy!

Easiest, yummiest yeast bread ever! I used one loaf to make Bierrocks and cooked the other as directed. Followed all directions exactly, and the bread came out perfect (second rise took a little longer than stated). Slightly dense and just a little sweet; I will make this again to go with some creamy spinach dip. Mmm my mouth is watering!

Tasted more like a super sweet version of wonderbread than homemade bread.  I knew that seemed like way too much sugar but I foolishly made the recipe anyways.

I have been trying a lot of bread recipes lately.  This is by far the best all around bread I have made.  I did read the reviews and decided to cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and used melted butter instead of oil.  It turned out two beautiful loaves with a nice crust and tender middle.  The first loaf hardly lasted the night.

I've been making this bread for 3 years and it is the very best! I use my Kitchen Aid to mix the dough and let it rise in the oven with the light on which seems to be just the right temperature. I do cut the amount of sugar in half. My son's love this warm with butter and  cinnamon sugar. This is the ultimate treat for my 10 year old. He says, "mom you could sell this stuff".

Wonderful and easy.  I make this every fall, so the house smells great.  If it is chilly in the house or you're worried about the rising- boil some water then pour it into a 9x13 pan and place it in the bottom of your oven.  Then place the bowl of dough on a higher rack and close the door. Works every time. This bread will be eaten very very quickly- it's that good.

This recipe is wonderful. I always have a loaf made. It is simple and versatile, I use it for hot and cold sandwiches, eat it alone, or dip it in olive oil and balsamic vinegar with Italian seasonings. I usually use a bit less sugar although using the amount the recipe calls for is great as well. I also make the two loaf amount but freeze half the dough at the step when you shape the dough before the second rising. I spray pam into a freezer bag so the dough doesnt stick to the bag. My boyfriend and I love this bread.

I must say I am tempted to give this bread 4 stars because of the sweetness.  I am the queen of a sweettooth and am suprised more reviews havn't complained of it being just a bit too sweet.  But ofcourse hot out of the oven I polished off 3 rolls with butter spread all over it.  They are very delicious and I think cinnamon rolls will be to die for with the sweetness this dough offers.  I made one loaf and rolled the other half into balls and put in muffin tins and made rolls.  I did let the dough rise again for another hour after I put it in the pans.  For those unsure of how long the yeast needs to proof...ten minutes is how long it takes.  Will make again and again and just cut the sugar alittle.

This recipe was awesome!!! When the bread was done it tasted like the rolls you get from the black eyed pea. My husband went nuts over them.
I let the bread rise about 1 1/2 hrs the first rise & then when I shaped the bread & put it in the pans I let it rise again for about 1-1 1/2 hrs. My bread was not dense at all because of this.

This is a basic, great starter bread for novices.  I love it!  I personally prefer less sweet and love to make grilled cheese with this bread.  Anyway, I reduce the sugar down to 2 tbs and I do not buy bread flour as I do not bake bread that often. I used I good quality unbleached white all purpose flour which makes the loaves nice and dense.  Terrific!

Maybe its my fault, but I can't seem to make this bread right. WAY too much water in my opinion. I had to add nearly an entire two cups of flour to get the right texture. I've tried making it multiple times and it has never quite lived up to my expectations. Sorry but I think I'm going to give up on this one.

I scaled this recipe to 12 servings and made it in my bread machine.  It is so good and easy.  I also made cinnamon raisin bread with this recipe by adding 1 Tbsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup raisins.  My family loved this recipe and my teenage daughter who doesn't even like raisins loved this bread made as cinnamon raisin bread.  Thanks!

This bread is fantastic!!! Turns out with a slightly sweet taste that is delicious!!! The second time I made it I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour and it turned out just as good as the original recipe!!! This bread is great for making Cinnamon Raisin Bread with, just roll into a retangle sprinkle with some cinnamon and raisins, roll up and bake. So delicious, light in texture and easy to make.

Very good bread. Not too sweet if you leave the yeast for 30 min at least.

I love this recipe.  I think it is easy and conveniant, especially if you don't have a bread machine.  I added a little brown sugar, honey, and cinnamon for a great cinnamon swirl bread.  Overall I love it, and so does my family.

I have made this recipe multiple times.  I use my KitchenAid Mixer for the whole process.  I first proof the water, sugar but only 1/3c and yeast in my mixer bowl (just to be certain my yeast is up to par). I use olive oil and I add one cup of the flour and mix completely, then slowly add more and so on.  Then when all is added I let my mixer knead on 1.5 to 2 for approx. 5 minutes.  The key to not being too dense is to let it rise long enough in a warm enough environment.  I start my oven to 200 while my kneading is happening, when the kneading is done I shut off the oven, dampen a towel and oil 2 bowls (for double loaf) put them in the oven on lowest rack with damp towels and let rise until doubled or more that doubled, punch and double or more again.  I have never ever had this recipe turn out wrong... at times I add more flour depending on sticking.  I have also used this with the full amount of sugar for cinnamon bread-After the first rise I punch down, roll out, sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the dough, roll it up, give it a short second rise and bake...I have given so many of these away... I get hounded for Cinnamon loaf constantly.  I love this recipe and will never shy away from it!!  Thank you so very much for such a wonderful, beautiful loaf!

This is a very good recipe, mine turned out great just using 1/4 cup of brown sugar and half the oil and half applesauce. Cooked for 35 minutes it turned out crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Really nice! Thank you!

I can't stress enough how delicious this bread is. I love to make this bread whenever I can, and no breadmaker here. I don't mind having to knead it, and maybe someday when I get a breadmaker I'll give it a shot. Until then, I'm perfectly fine with working for such a delicious outcome. My boyfriend even loves this bread, though I often have to make two batches... one with reduced sugar, as others have commented for myself, and one with the full amount of sugar for him. 

A few tips I can give to anyone who is trying this bread recipe for the first time, make sure to always check and see if the dough is warm enough... Keep the cloth warm and damp, and go with your gut. I've had to add bits of water here and there when I got a really dry dough. Also, make sure you let the yeast proof! As another review said, wait ten minutes or so, and the foam should be higher than the water level. Happy baking, everyone!

With more then 2000 reviews, does this recipe really need another review with 5 stars???? YES! My granny used to make homemade bread every time we went to visit her. Unfortunately her bread making secrets died with her. I've tried bread recipe after recipe and this is the only one that even comes close to hers. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is excellent!! I have been making it 2x's a week for a while now. I cut the sugar in half, and it is perfect. I also use this dough to make cinnamon rolls, and I just made a wheat bread version using brown sugar instead of white and adding 2 tablespoons of honey, it was so moist and yummy!!! But if you make the wheat bread, cook it a little longer. I don't know if this is everyone's experience making wheat bread, but mine always seems to have to cook a little longer than the white.

I found the original recipe to be a little bit dry by the time I got through a loaf plus it was a bit straining on my kitchen aid, so I modified the recipe for one loaf at a time. These amounts are also easier to remember off the top of my head without going back to the recipe. 
1c water +1T yeast. 
1/3c olive oil +1/3c sugar. 
3c flour +dash of salt.
If you are making rolls with it, you can dip them in a baking soda/boiling water solution before baking and it gives them a delicious pretzel like coating which goes well with the sweet dough. 
I also this recipe as a base for cinnamon rolls & strudel breads.

This is my every week bread recipe, makes 2 large loaves of bread that yield about 32 big slices in total.
The only change I make is to reduce sugar to 2 tablespoons to get a more neutral flavor and extra "fluffiness".
We haven't been able to enjoy store bought bread since I first made this delicious homemade bread 2 years ago.
Great in cinnamon rolls and dinner buns too.

Excellent!  I'm new to bread baking, but I won't be for long with this recipe. I cut the sugar in half based upon the reviews but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I didn't have bread flour, just all-purpose, so I added some essential wheat gluten I bought a while back, when my first few attempts at baking bread failed.  I made half into dinner rolls and the other into a loaf. It rose very quickly. So much I had to put it in the fridge to keep it until dinner was ready so I could have hot rolls. Even so, I had to punch the loaf down a second time and let it re-raise since I didn't have room in the oven.  The next day I cut in in half, and made it with the suger called for, making it into cinnamon rolls.  They were delicious!  I'll be making this bread again and again! Just wonderful!

Probably the easiest bread I've ever made! And close to the best. I messed up in the beginning  and didn't knead long enough then I had to cut the first rise time short but even with those two mishaps the bread came out golden brown and sweet. A little dense but next time I'll keep a better eye on things.


Edit: I made another batch and let it rise for an extra twenty minutes the first time and ten on the second and kneaded a lot longer and boy! It came out so good!!! Definitely a hit. I've been told by my family to make it every week!

I followed breadguy's (Feb 19, 2007) suggestions as I have a KitchenAid too. The bread was amazingly easy, I don't know why you'd bother with a breadmaker. My family were very impressed and I'll definitely make it again.

I've used and LOVED this recipe for years.  I usually add about half the sugar to make it a little fluffier.  It tastes great both ways, but the greater amount of sugar will make the loaf more dense.  Since I have a whole wheat recipe I prefer to use for our sandwich bread, I've started using this recipe for dinner rolls.  They are DIVINE!  After the first rise, shape into rolls and place them barely touching in a cake pan.  Let them rise a few minutes and bake.  I usually brush a little butter on the tops when they're half done.  Enjoy!

My sister-in-law pointed me to this recipe when I asked how she made such wonderful bread. It's easy, simple, and has always turned out for me. I make it a couple times a month at least. It's very similar to the sweetness of a hawaiian roll. I tried it with less sugar, and while it turned out, I preferred the sweet. Sometimes I make loaves, sometimes rolls. This is my go-to dinner bread!

I made a loaf of bread and a pan of rolls with this recipe.  My husband loved them.  He said they tasted just like his grandmother's recipe.  I used my kitchen aide to do the mixing and kneading they way one other reviewer suggested.  This may become my new go to bread recipe.  Thanks for posting it Peg.

Very easy....very good!  After 30 minutes of rising in the bread pans, it wasn't super high, but after 30 minutes in the oven, I couldn't believe how much it had risen!  And it was perfect, through and through, and sliced like a dream.

Brush the loaf w/butter or oil right after it comes out of the bread machine and cover w/dishcloth to get a nice soft crust.

Instead of loaves, I separate into tiny balls, and place 3 marble sized balls into each muffin pan, rise according to instructions, then brush an egg wash over the top of each roll- The result is unbelieveable!  Yummy, beautiful, perfect!!!

This is my first review, but i had to rate this bread! I have baked lots of bread. This bread turned out better than any before. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out excellent!

Ever since I found this recipe about a month ago, I completely stopped buying sliced bread altogether. The bread is just yummy and simple. I don't even need the bread maker... all purpose or bread flour, it comes out right each and every time!

Made this recipe today!  I accidently used olive oil; but it still turned out delicious.  So quick & easy to make.  I kneaded it with my kitchenaid mixer on #2 for 4 minutes.  Love, love, love this recipe!

Very yummy and easy. The texture reminds me of a roll or even french bread. I made mine with only 2 tablespoons of sugar (per loaf). Also, mine only took 2.5 cups of flour (per loaf), instead of the 3 called for. I will probably make this again. If I don't, it is only because there are lots of other good bread recipes out there.

This bread is so good...I make this recipe for my family 2 to 3 times a week now!  We can't go back to store-bought bread after eating this.  I took the suggestions of others and have made the 2nd loaf into cinnamon swirl bread.  I've also made rolls using the dough for the second loaf (I just rolled the dough into little balls and placed them on a baking sheet).  I'm a novice at baking bread, and I find it easier to add the last cup of flour gradually as I am kneading the dough.  This bread looks as "pretty" as store-bought bread, but tastes far superior.

I'm a 16 year old who bakes and cooks for my little family of three. I never had done bread, but I know I have talent when baking, so this was my first bread recipe I ever tried! I was confused at first when it came to doing the yeast, and then when it was time to let the dough rise, it looked like it hardly changed. But, to my surprise, it was WONDERFUL! When it cooked, it rose a great amount and turned out just the way I wanted. Sweet, soft, and not too dense at all! But, the 30 minutes was not enough, there was a small doughy part when we finally sliced it (which might been because of the loaf pan but that's an easy fix.) So, all-in-all great recipe!!

I make this at least once a week.  It is awesome.  The first few times I cut back on sugar like others suggested, but decided to try with the full amount of sugar one day and wow....we loved it!  I love to make this into cinnamon bread by rolling it out and sprinkling with a generous amount of sugar and cinnamon, then rolling back up and making into a loaf.  It is delicious.  I have had several people comment that they thought I actually bought it at a bakery.  Definitely a family favorite now!

Wow!  This bread is both easy & DELICIOUS!  It's definitely a sweet bread, along the lines of 'Kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread'.  I used my KA (6 qt. capacity) and I added all the flour at once.  Once yeast mixture and flour were incorporated, I kneaded it on level 3 & 4 for 6 minutes, turned out, split in 2, and put in bread pans and continued with next rising and bakinig.  We love it! I have made 6 loaves in three days.  Oh, and a loaf of bread, warm and wrapped in a new tea towel, makes a great 'Welcome to the neighborhood' gift.  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!
FOR THE BREAD MACHINE QUESTIONS:
Bread machines typically can't handle 6 cups of flour.  Cut the recipe in half, except use 2 teaspoons of yeast.  Like normal, place your wet ingredients in bread pan, top with flour, make an indent and add yeast.  You have two options:  1) Remove the ball of dough after the kneading process, usually about 20 mins in, and finish as recipe indicates...or.....let it complete the whole bread-baking cycle like normal. 

If you try it...post your results!

I would dearly love to add this to my bread recipe collection, but I would like to know how to convert the recipe for my bread machine...if you have tried it in the bread machine, I'd appreciate your tips!

Really good bread! I've made bread so many times, I can't even count. This recipe was easy, tasty and turned out like I expected. I DID lower the sugar, and added some flaxseed meal and wheat germ in place of some of the flour. Because some of the reviews said it was a little heavy, I added some vital wheat gluten. It was still a little dense, but that was due to my additions.  Even with the lower sugar, the bread is still sweet. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just depends on what you're looking for. I made one small, plain loaf, one larger cinnamon raisin bread loaf, and 15 cinnamon rolls.   If I follow this again, I'll lower the sugar even more. The cinnamon rolls were really good. The crust was a little chewy, but it was good and the center was still soft. I rolled out the dough, spread on a thin layer of butter then brown sugar and cinnamon. Once they were done cooking, I turned them out onto a cooling rack, and covered them with a home made powdered sugar frosting. Everyone said they were tasty.   Some time soon, I'm going to show 3 others (non-bakers) how to make bread my hand. I'll use this recipe, and show them how many ways they can use this dough!!

This is a great recipe.   I make 4 loaves a week. Give 3 away and everyone loves it.  Great flavor with a touch of sweetness.

I've been making this bread for about two years now and love it on it's own but have just discovered you can use this recipe for the Overnight Caramel Pecan Rolls from this site.  I use half to make a fresh loaf of bread for dinner and turn the other half into the Overnight Caramel Pecan Rolls so the next morning we have fresh, warm pecan rolls.  So good!

This recipe makes a wonderful tasting soft bread (not heavy like some!). I made it both plain and one with cinnamon and white raisins. This recipe is a keeper! The crust got brown but did not burn and stayed soft and easy to cut thin slices - a real bonus!

This bread is awsome and very easy to make! I got it right on the first try! I used regular all-purpose flour and a fast rise active yeast to skip the boiling. I also prolonged the cooking time by 20 mins. and it turned out great!

I've made this recipe twice, the first time following the recipe as written, the second time I reduced the sugar down to 2 tbs. Both times the taste was outstanding, the second was less sweet and equivalent to store bought. the dense texture is great for toasting and makes great French Toast. Easy to make and flawless every time. I plan on making another batch as written but adding cinnamon and raisins with a swirl. Highly recommend. Plus the smell is heavenly

I really liked this bread, but think I underbaked it, next time I will try it a little longer in the oven, it was a little doughy.  It would make a great sandwich bread.

Simple, traditional and lovely! Made two large loaves this afternoon, and it's almost all gone already. This is the kind of bread where you skip making the sandwiches you intended to use it for, slice it warm, slather with butter and eat it right up.

I used Kosher salt, a canola/soy oil, 4 cups whole wheat flour, and kneaded in about a cup and a half of all purpose flour. I will use this recipe often. Very good bread (I painted butter on top when it came out of the oven).

I never make white bread, as I am a health nut and usually prefer to make whole grain bread, but since I was making BLTs for dinner last night, I figured white bread would be nice for a change.  It turned out very well and everyone enjoyed it.  I made this completely by hand instead of using my mixer as I normally do, and I'm glad I did.  I think making it by hand is what gives it the right texture.  After all, the Amish do not use electric appliances.  I used the full amount of sugar and unlike many reviewers I did not find it to be too sweet.  In fact, it reminds me a great deal of Wegmans Farmhouse White bread from their bakery, which is a heartier white bread also.  I will definitely make this again if white bread is ever required, and I see no need for changes!

This is a wonderful easy bread.  My daughter is wild about it, and its extremely simple for a beginner.  I highly recommend that when it's time to bake, you turn on the oven , then put the loaves  in while it's still cold. It makes it rise to beautiful heights.

This recipe was awesome!  It was the first time I have ever made bread and it came out perfectly!  I don't care for overly sweet bread, so I took another reviewer's advice and reduced the sugar to three tablespoons.  I used my regular beaters to mix in the salt and oil and then switched to bread hooks when I started adding flour.  When the flour was almost all mixed in, I turned the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and kneaded it for two or three minutes.  Every step went like clockwork and there was very little mess to clean up.  The bread hadn't even cooled enough to handle before my family was begging for slices of it.  The texture was perfect.  The shape was perfect. The taste was perfect!

I just made this in my breadmaker and it is wonderful.  The smell is so good.  I used, in order:  1 c warm water ~1/8 c Wesson vegetable oil 3 c Gold Medal all-purpose flour ~1/6 c sugar 3/4 tsp salt 3/4 tbsp Red Star Quick Rise yeast  I ran it for as white bread, 1.0lb loaf, light crust for 2:50.  I was worried that the yeast time to rise on its own but it worked out great.

I love this bread.  I cut the recipe in half and use the dough setting on my bread machine and then bake it in the oven.  My son would eat a peanut butter sandwich for every meal if I let him.  I like knowing exactly what is in all that bread he eats!

This is awsome! I took the advice of others and cut the sugar. Still sweet but I like sweet bread. Threw everything in my bread machine on dough and let it do the work. Then put in a bowl to raise and followed the directions. It's already gone and will make more tomorrow. Definitely a keeper.

Can I just say that this is one awesome recipe?  I halved the recipe (to make one loaf) and I used only 1/4 C sugar.  It was perfect!  My 6 y/o says it's the best bread ever!  This bread keeps best when sliced with an electric knife (or slicer) and then wrapped (I used foil) and stored in the freezer in a zip top bag.  To use, just take what you need out and wrap 2 slices at a time in paper towels and microwave 20-30 sec.  You can toast from frozen state. UPDATE:  I tried to make this bread again today and it didn't turn out - I didn't proof the yeast and you NEED TO - even if using the "rapid rise".  Also, don't use less than 1/4 cup of sugar or it won't turn out.  Mistakes happen to the best of us!

I've been using this recipe for a few yrs -- love it!  It looks like a few may need some advice on using a bread machine.  I never bake bread in mine since it turns out so much better in an oven, but I love it for mixing, kneading, rising.  I use LESS SUGAR (1/4 c. for 2 loaves) since we prefer a classic, non-sweet sandwich bread.  I usually halve this recipe to make one loaf, adding ingredients to machine in this order:  1 c. warm water, 2 TBS oil, first cup of flour, 3/4 tsp. salt, 2nd cup of flour, 2 TBS sugar, 3rd cup of flour; make small well in top of flour and add 2-1/4 tsp. rapid-acting/bread machine yeast.  Start dough cycle, and once done, remove dough, punch down, knead for a few, then shape into loaf (don't fret over that - it'll conform to shape of pan as it rises).  I boil a cup of water in the microwave, then remove it and put the bread pan (covered with Pam-sprayed plastic wrap) in there to rise.  When I make two loaves, I still use the machine to mix/knead, but once that's done, I put the dough in a large bowl to rise (2 lb machine doesn't allow enough room for 2 loaves to fully rise). Start the bread at least 4-5 hrs before you want to eat it (2:40 prep/bake, 2 hrs to cool so center isn't too moist to slice).  Hope this is helpful!

How easy and delicious! I took the advice of another user and covered the bowl with plastic wrap while it was rising and I think that really helped it rise to the enormous size it did. I only wanted one loaf so I made cinnamon rolls out of the other half of dough: Roll out to 1/4 inch think, spread thick with butter, and sprinkle with a tossed mixture of 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Roll up the dough and cut into 2 inch sections and place in a pan where they are tight but not so tight that they can't rise. Allow to rise in the pan for 1/2 hour and take out of the oven at about 25 minutes. Great bread! Great rolls!

This bread wouldv'e probably been a lot better for us if the sugar was cut down a bit. I am a sweets fanatic but not in my bread, that is unless I added some cinnamon and raisins to make a raisin bread. I guess I was just looking for something different and if I would have read the reviews, I would have seen that it was on the sweet side. However, it rose beautifully and the texture was fabulous as well!

I've tried several white bread recipes, and this is my favorite. I reduce the sugar to 1/4C to make it lighter, and it yields a nice, evenly textured loaf, which is good for sandwiches.

Update: I tried it with 1/3 whole wheat flour the other day, and it came out a bit softer than the all white flour version does, which turned out to be a problem when making lunch box sandwiches with it. It was really good, though.

All I can say is WOW.  This is the best white loaf I have ever made.  I made it to the recipe with one exception.  I did 1/2 sugar and 1/2 honey rather than all sugar and I made 3 smaller loaves.  Such an easy dough and a wonderfully light texture.  This is our new white bread!!!  Thank you for the recipe!!  :)

This bread is great!  I like the sweet flavor and the light texture.  I halved the recipe and put it in the breadmaker on the dough cycle.  Once it was done, I took it out, shaped into a loaf, placed in a pan, and let rise for 45 minutes. After that, I baked as directed, although it took about 40 minutes to bake through.

Great bread!  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 c and will be adding more salt to my recipe in the future.

PERFECT, great for open-faced sandwiches, grilled cheese, you name it!  Wonderful on its own!

This was my first try at making bread and and it turned out well. It was a sweeter bread - like reviewers said, almost the taste of Hawaiian bread. A little denser than I would prefer for an every day bread. I might use this with some cinnamon and raisins mixed in for breakfast. Thanks!

I don't make homemade bread very often.  I usually settle for it in my bread machine but am very glad that I tried this one.  It turned out AWESOME!  I did follow some of the other reviews and used less sugar than called for.  I only used 1/4 cup instead of the 2/3 cup it called for and it really worked out well by giving it not too sweet of a taste and came out very light and "fluffy".  Before baking, I also brushed some melted butter on top to help it give a nice golden and buttery crust.  I could actually taste the butter too!  I will definetly make this again!  I did although have to let the dough rise longer than said when it was in the pans.  It had to sit for almost 45 minutes before it was ready to go in the oven.  All in all this was a good recipe and will definetly make again.

Hi,
I have made this recipe for years.  I started using all white flour but have since switched to 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat with no problem. I also mix it in my bread machine instead of the mixer, I have never been able to knead the bread just right and the machine does it for me.  Somebody said that you have to use bread flour, not true.  I have never, ever used bread flour and have had no problem yet.  This is the only recipe that I use because if I use another one my husband and kids complain.

AWESOME!!!  I scaled the recipes from 24 servings to 12 (one loaf).  I did reduce the sugar amount as recommended.  I put 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in the one loaf and followed the other instructions exactly.  I did have to knead it for longer than I expected but it was worth it.  The bread came out perfect!  I would definitely recommend this recipe. THANKS!

I have been baking this bread for a while and hands down....this is the only recipe for me.  It is so good that I shared it with two other of my friends and it is their exclusive bread recipe, too!  One of them cuts the sugar to 1/2 cup....but, as for me, it's perfect just the way it is.  It is the first homemade bread recipe I have found that actually compared to Mrs. Bairds!

As is I give the recipe four stars, but with my variations five.  I cut the sugar in half and subed a cup of flour for hazelnut meal.  The hazelnut meal gave it a slightly sweet and nutty taste plus it looked great with little fleck of brown.

This is a great recipe. It allows you to work with a wonderful dough that just feels so good on your hands. I suggest you put the two loaves in one large pan, side by side. With a sharp knife, cut a tic tac toe type pattern across the top, or a couple large gashes. I washed the top of one with honey and added poppy seeds. the other, I washed with egg yolk. This yielded two absolutely gorgeous loaves of bread that were most delicious and dramatically beautiful. Definitely try this recipe out for yourself. I plan to make this again, next time for guests. Thanks to the original poster for sharing.

I've made this bread twice now, and both times it has turned out great.  I mixed and kneaded it with my KitchenAid mixer, and used all purpose flour.
The first time I used a little less sugar, and I liked it better. Makes great toast, and garlic bread slices, a great all around bread!

I made this bread yesterday for the first time and it was fantastic.  I used half the dough for a loaf and split the other half into 21 balls and stuffed a cocktail sausage inside each one for pigs in a blanket.  They were incredible!

A friend of mine made this recently, and it was great.

To TMURRAY - There are a few things that might have happened with the yeast.  If your water was too hot, it could have killed off some of the yeast and made it less potent.  If your yeast was old, or if it had been stored improperly in transport or at the store, that could have damaged/killed some of the yeast as well, which would have made it rise less and would result in a tougher dough. I'm afraid that I don't really have a solution for that, other than to be sure that the yeast is proofing well before you add the rest of the ingredients. If it takes a long time to proof, ((if you don't see much activity after about five minutes,)) you might want to go buy some new yeast from a different store, because that's most likely the problem. Hope that helped some!

This is the only bread in our house now,even with a bread machine!
There is something very satisfying in seeing this through to the end, especially when everyone gobbles it up--even very paticular kids.
It freezes well too.

This is the fluffiest, lightest white bread recipe I have found. Easy to make, perfect every time. Add 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese and 1/2 chopped canned jalepenos for a nice variation.

I followed "BreadGuy's" instructions for the KA mixer and I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I read the reviews and saw several people mentioned the bread was too dense. When I made it I wasn't able to use the total amount of flour called for( I probably had more then a cup left over) I don't feel compelled to use all the flour called for if the dough doesn't seem to want to take it..I go by look because different conditions ( heat, cold humidity, brand of flour etc) can affect the result so I stop when the dough looks smooth , slightly glossy and feels soft but not sticky, regardless of how much flour I've used. The result for this recipe was a loaf that stood 4 inches high in the pan and had a very tender crumb and delicious flavor..a keeper.

This has to be THE BEST sandwich bread recipe!!! I have been experimenting with different recipes because I don't like all the flour  and bread enhancers in store bought breads. So, this one will be from now on the official sandwich bread at our house!! My kids just love it. You can easy cut the recipe in half if you one jut one loaf. I did modified the sugar, though, I added half a cup instead of 2/3 cup, and it is perfect!

The second batch I made of this bread came out perfect.  I followed the recipe for the first batch (except I halved the recipe).  It came out too dense.  That's partially my fault though because I don't believe I kneaded long enough (first time bread maker).  For the second batch, I reduced the sugar significantly (only used 2 tablespoons in total for a halved recipe), kneaded much longer, and it came out great!  I noticed that the yeast proofed much better with less sugar too.  The taste of this bread is superb!

This is my go-to bread recipe. I made this recipe exactly as written the first time, and would give the results five stars.  After the first time, I made a couple of the suggested changes to make it healthier. First, I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup as other reviewers suggested. It  really doesn't change much. Secondly, I use 4 cups of white whole wheat flour and the rest white flour. I find that less white whole wheat flour is needed than white, so I usually use only 1/2 to 1 cup of white flour in addition to the 4 cups of white whole wheat flour. It takes a tad longer to rise because the wheat flour is heavier, but it's really yummy and feels a bit more virtuous.

I have made this bread recipe several times in the last month.  I will no longer buy bread at the store.  It's super easy to make and i can do this without checking the recipe now.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4c and it's perfect for sandwiches.  I've also sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before rolling and putting in the pans and after it baked i sliced it for french toast.

This has to be one of the best basic white breads that I have ever made, and I have made a lot of bread!  Per several reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and next time will reduce to 1/4 and see how I like it.  I am definitely glad that I reduced the sugar, as it would have been too sweet for my liking.  I also only needed to use 5 cups of flour for my dough to be perfect.  With this recipe I made a large loaf of bread, and 9 huge rolls.  They had a perfect texture, soft yet sturdy and the bread had a nice crumb and was easy to slice.  This is going to go into my regular rotation!  Thumbs up!

I love this bread. I usually make half a recipe at a time and sometimes before I bake it I roll it out and add a filling like cinnamon and sugar or pepperoni and cheese then roll into a loaf. It has never failed me yet!

I haven't made bread in yrs, so I was a little nervous. My first batch was good, had a few mistakes. Second batch and there after, came out great. To make the bread healthier, I used raw honey instead of sugar and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. It turned out phenomenal. I have a kitchen aid mixer, so the dough hook attachment was wonderful since I injured a hand.Put dough hook on speed 2 and never go over this speed. And remember yeast will get kind of foamy.  You will love this bread. If it doesn't come out right...don't give up...keep at it. You will be rewarded!!! It's a dense bread and with the honey it's not as sweet, but oh so good.

SUPER easy, SUPER yummy, NO FAIL recipe!!!  Perfect rolls... and, with a family full of people that can't have ANY dairy, this is AWESOME!!!!!!  Works with wheat flour, white flour, or a combo of the two... I usually do 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white.  (Although, depending on the humidity of the day, you may need to adjust the flour amounts.  I have used from 4-7 cups flour depending.)  THANK YOU!!!!!!

I chose this recipe as my first foray into bread baking and I'm so glad I did!  Thank you to all the reviewers who helped me make he decision!  This is super easy and comes out delicious!  I did not need the full 6 cups of flour, I end up using about 5 1/2.  I also took the suggestions to cut the sugar by half, and I personally would not want the bread any sweeter.  The rises took longer than the recipe states but I just know to make bread on a day I'm in no hurry.  This is my standard recipe!  I love how it can be changed up without affecting the end result.  I made with half wheat flour and some flax meal last time and it came out just as perfect as the original.  Cannot say enough good things!!

I have done this exactly as the recipe says multiple times! It always turns out great! One time, I left it to rise and got called into work. 7 hours later, it was extremely puffed up, but still cooked beautifully! I recently added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and switched half the bread flour for whole wheat flour! I changed the sugar to about two tablespoons of honey (a little more because I totally overflowed the spoon), substituted sweetened applesauce for the oil and just added flour until the consistency was right. It made an amazing whole-wheat bread with an extra touch of sweetness! Perfect for my parents, who are both on a low-sugar, no-oil diet!

Just tried this and it turned out wonderfully.  I was not looking for a sweet bread, so I followed the suggestion to only use two TBSP of sugar and it turned out fine.  It was nice and soft and fluffy with just a touch of chewiness.  I used all purpose flour as well as I had no bread flour on hand.  With these few ingredients it's all about the quality of the raw ingredients and technique.  I use an instant read thermometer to get the water temperature correct-too warm and you will kill the yeast.  Hold back a cup or so of the flour and add it bit by bit until it is the correct texture, and let it rise fully.

My only complaint is actually with the video that shows you how to make this bread.  "Form a loaf "does not mean to simply chop the dough in two and stuff it in the bread pan.  You need to roll it out into a large rectangle and fold it in thirds (like a letter) then flatten a bit more and roll it up, pinching the seam along the bottom shut and tucking and pinching the ends under.

Can't wait to make this again, I would use the full amount of sugar to make a sweet loaf or for making cinnamon rolls, cutting it back to two TBSP  for a loaf to use for sandwiches.

I use this recipe to make cinnamon rolls.  Add 1Tbsp cinnamon when you add the oil and salt.  After the dough rises, punch down and roll out into a rectangle. Spread softened butter over the dough and then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar (sorry I never bothered to measure how much I use, just go until it looks good to you). Roll into a log, use dental floss or string to cut 1inch rolls. Place in pan with sides touching (I usually use two 9 in pie pans).  Let rise for 30 mins, bake at 350 for 20-25 mins.  Topping:  beat 1 8oz package softened cream cheese with 2Tbsp milk and 2-3Tbsp sugar until smooth.  Spread over warm cinnamon rolls and enjoy.

Fantastic!  Let me just say that I suck at making bread, and this turned out perfectly!  The texture was right.  It tasted great.  I can finally stop searching for a recipe, and just use this one over and over.  Yay!

My 14 yr old son wanted to make bread and this was the recipe we chose. We followed someone else's suggestion to cut the sugar to only 2 TBLS and it was a wise decision. This recipe is beyond easy and the bread comes out perfectly every single time. My husband is a baker/pastry chef and he was quite impressed with our son's bread and actually took the recipe from him to use at work. The beauty of the whole thing? 
I NEVER have to make bread anymore....my TEENAGER DOES IT! Thank you, Peg, for submitting it.

I made this yesterday. It was easy to make and relatively quick. I used melted butter instead of oil, and did what others suggested and toned down the sugar to 4 tbsp. I only had one loaf pan, so I shaped half the dough into a mound, put a few slices on top, and put it on a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Both came out great. This bread really isn't great enough to eat by itself, but it is great with things, or butter/jam. It tastes much like a dinner roll you could get at a restaurant. It is missing a little something for it to stand all by itself. Slices well, and I will probably make again but with more sugar. 

Also, those of you with Kitchen Aid mixers, don't bother with it. This bread dough is too stiff and just climbs the hook. The job is better done with your hands.

It's not unheard of for me to bake fresh bread multiple times a week. I love bread. I have my standard recipes and I do not deviate much. I must say in this case though - I'm glad I did. I halved it because I was wary but it was so good! My husband and I used it for sandwich bread and toast for a week or so after! Will definitely make again, thank you.

I absolutely love this recipe.  My bread turns out wonderful each and every time and it is by far my favorite white bread recipe. Totally, a foolproof recipe. One slight change I made was reducing the sugar to a about half a cup.  It was a bit too sweet for my personal taste but my family thought it was perfect the way it is written.

This was the first bread recipe I've made by hand (I've used a bread machine a couple times with mediocre results). Oh my goodness! So good! Light, moist and delicious. I want to eat the whole loaf. I'll be making this recipe again and again.

Looking for a dinner roll recipe, I decided to use this one with GREAT results: Like others, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 C then after punching down, I used a 2 tablespoon sized cookie scoop to measure dough balls.  I gave them a smash with my palm then shaped them & put them in greased muffin tins & let rise 30mins. Bake @ 350 for 12-14 mins until golden.  This way yields approx 55-60 rolls. To freeze: let dough balls rise on greased cookie sheet then cover & put in freezer.  Once frozen, transfer to freezer bags.  To bake, thaw in fridge 24 hrs then bake as above.  Egg wash would be nice on these as well.

Love this recipe.  I've tried various recipes from this site over the years but this is the one I keep coming back to. In fact, I printed it out and keep it taped to my cabinet.  :)  I've tried it as written and with less sugar, both ways are delicious.  I have also turned it into a cinnamon swirl bread (roll out the dough, and add some cinnamon and a little brown sugar) rolled it up and finished it off just like a regular loaf.  The kids loved that one!  This bread is great because it slices really well (when you are patient enough to let it cool first anyway) :) , which means it can be used to make  pb&j for the kids.  Great recipe!

My go-to recipe for dinner rolls! I use melted butter instead of vegetable oil. Form into balls instead of loaves, and bake for about 20 min, until golden brown. I have never had a bad batch!

I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about trying this recipe because 2/3 cup sugar seemed too much for bread. I however decided to go along with it and was surprised. The bread was sweet yes...but it had a sweetness that was pleasant and it made sense. 
Apart from that the texture was soft and spongy.I am grateful that I came across this recipe as it is now "my signature" recipe for white bread. Thanks for posting!!

5 stars is not enough!  This bread is delicious and easy to make.  My husband and I ate almost an entire loaf with our "breakfast dinner" last night.  I considered halving the recipe to make only 1 loaf, but I'm glad I didn't.  I used the exact measurements called for in the recipe and used my KitchenAid mixer with dough hook to do the kneading.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  I plan on making this bread every week!  ***edit:  I've now made this bread 3 times and every time it turns out delicious!!!  I'm addicted :-)

Made this for the first time yesterday. For my first time making bread(usually use a bread machine)it turned out really good. My kids loved it for pb&j in their lunches and it made perfect french toast. Next time I will grease my pans with butter instead of Crisco. Think the Crisco gave the crust a bit of an off taste. Otherwise I will definitely be making this again! It was very good and very easy.

This was my third loaf of bread I've ever baked and it's AMAZING. My first loaf I killed the yeast because I used water that was too hot. My husband took one bite and had to spit it out. (I used a recipe I found on StumbleUpon.) My second loaf was alright, but a little dense. I think I tapped it on the counter and destroyed the second rise. (The same recipe) This recipe is way better. I followed it exactly and it was delicious!! I will definitely make it again!

This is my 'go-to' white bread recipe. I have made it several times and it comes out great each time. This last time I made them into dinner rolls and also clover-shaped rolls (put 3 dough balls in a muffin tin so when the raise they resemble a clover leaf, really fancy looking!). I use my standing mixer with dough hook and it makes kneading effortless. When I made the rolls I let the dough rise much longer for the last rising and they came out so light that my co-workers were amazed at my culinary skills. Little did they know how easy this recipe is to follow.

My absolute favorite bread recipe! It's super fast and really easy...especially if your yeast is fresh and ready to rise! I know people say this all the time, but seriously, if your yeast is past the expiration date, don't use it. When you buy yeast, even if it is dry active, REFRIGERATE IT! You won't regret making this easy decision. This bread is supposed to rise in an hour...with fresh yeast, it rose in 30 minutes!

Add some cheddar cheese and jalapenos for a kick or olives and rosemary to spice up your pasta!

*NOTE* For really moist bread, place a pan with a few 1-2 inches of water on the bottom rack of your oven to steam the bread while baking. It comes out extremely delicious!

So I made a single-loaf batch of this recipe but--oh no!--couldn't find my loaf pan!  So I divided the dough into 12 balls after the first rise, and let them rise the second time in a cupcake pan.  Put the pan in the oven at 325, baked until golden, and had delicious dinner rolls.  My family wiped them out in minutes!

Came out perfect even though it has been a long, long time since last made bread.  I mean decades.  Followed directions and came out great.  Might try less sugar next time but it was not too sweet.

I reduce this to recipe to 16 serving so that i can use my 8 inch square pan to make 2 loafs side by side. I use my bread maker to do the knead using the 'dough setting' which has a 20 minute kneading. I do this twice so it gets 40 minutes of kneading. I bake it using my 8 inch square pan in my toaster oven 30-35 minutes. This is the BEST RECIPE EVER!!  I no longer buy bread since i can make my own, control the ingredients, know the quality and best of all, it costs pennies to make 2 loaves! thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I made this with regular flour instead of bread flour. The bread turned out a bit flaky, but so moist and delicious that I could care less how flaky it is! It has a slight sweet flavor, so if you butter the slice it adds a bit of a zing. YUM!

This is great!  I occasionally substitute about 6T melted butter for the oil.  Either way it always turns out nice.  Love the texture.

To use whole wheat flour, you can substitute up to half of the flour. For each cup you use of whole wheat, add 1 TBS of water. I have used regular AP, bread flour and whole wheat and all turn out about the same. My favorite is to substitute 2 cups of whole wheat (of the 6) with regular or bread flour. I don't change the sugar. It is a wonderful, very high rising bread. If you want a fluffier loaf-of any combination of flour - let it rise longer. I got my wheat loaf as high as 6 inches and it was still moist and delicious. Just do not forget the TBS of water for every cup of whole wheat (up to half of the recipe). I have used all brands of all flour and they are about the same.  King Arthur is on of the higher rising ones though.  I make about 5-7 loaves a week.

This bread is AWESOME!  I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, and it was perfect for sandwiches, and still had the wonderful lightly sweet flavor that goes great with butter.  I think it would have been great with the full 2/3 c. sugar, but might have been a little sweet for sandwich bread (but would be ideal for eating with butter).  Everyone that tried this bread was bowled over by how delicious it was.  Best bread recipe I've ever made OR tasted!

This was my first time making bread in over 10 years, and it turned out perfect!  I followed this recipe exactly, and I didn't think it was "too sweet" like many other reviewers.  Somebody compared this to Hawaiian Bread but I couldn't agree less.  HB is much sweeter, and obviously so.

I let my yeast proof for 10 minutes just as the recipe called for, let it rise for about 1.5 hours before putting it into the 9x5 pans, and let it rise another 30 min before baking.  I used a PAM spray on the inside of the pans and had no sticking issues whatsoever.  I baked for exactly 30 minutes, took the bread out, and removed it from the pans.  It took almost an hour to cool down while sitting on the breadboard, but will slice much easier if you wait.  Excellent recipe, and definitely one worth tweaking to keep it interesting!

I've now made more than 30 loaves of this bread and it comes out wonderfully every time.  I follow the recipe as written and it comes out as a soft, slightly sweet loaf.  If you want a denser bread, use half AP flour but we love the soft, fluffy loaves we get with the bread flour.  Every week I make a double recipe and get ten dinner rolls (lower the bake time to 20 mins), two loaves of sandwich bread and one loaf of cinnamon raisin bread.  This is my very favorite white bread recipe - it has more than 2,500 reviews and five stars for a reason!

If you think it's too dense, let it rise longer the next time, it's that simple!  I love the dense texture b/c it is perfect for grilled cheese or toast, if its too fluffy, it doesn't work well for those things.

I've been making this bread since I was 16yrs (I am now 26yrs), it is the first bread I EVER made from scratch and I still use it to this day because it is such a versatile bread!  You can reduce the sugar if you like, but I don't, I think it's fine as is!  

 You can also experiment with different oils if you like. I've used Olive Oil, canola, vegetable, lard, bacon fat, it really depends on your taste.  :)  

This is a great recipe for its versatality, if you want it dense, stick to the time stated, if you want it fluffier, let it rise longer, but my suggestion is, STICK TO THE ORIGINAL RECIPE THE FIRST TIME, make adjustments if you like after that, but as all ready stated, I think it's just dandy as is!  :D  But that's up to you if you do to.  

God Bless ~Amy

The best bread ever!!! Moist fluffy and very tasty.  I could only get 5.5 cups of flour in mix but still turned out great.  I coated my bread pan with Annie's organic olive oil with garlic it gave the bread a lovely putter flavor with a hint of garlic. ( oil from Costco)

This bread was very good.  Tried the suggestion of less sugar--used 1/3 cup of sugar and it was just right.  It is a dense bread, I'll try half bread flour and half all purpose flour next time for a bit lighter bread as the kids prefer that.

I bake many differnt kinds of bread, but the bread my family keeps asking for is the Amish White Bread. It always come out perfectly.  The only change I made was as many other people have suggested was to reduce the sugar to 1/3 of of cup.

This is a fantastic recipe! It's super easy and extremely adaptable as well.  The first time I made it, I followed the instructions exactly, and it produced a very sweet, somewhat dense, but delicious bread that my husband devoured.  The next time, I cut the sugar in half, sifted the flour, and used my KitchenAid mixer to do the kneading for me.  I used the dough to make dinner rolls, which were an instant hit! They were light, fluffy and delicious.  The only problem I've run into is that it takes longer for the dough to rise the first time than the recipe says.  Plan on two hours instead of one.  If you're looking for a good basic bread, this is it!

This is hands-down the very best white bread I have ever eaten, let alone made.  I may never buy bread from the store again.  Like some other reviewers, I did decrease the sugar to 2 Tbsp because I wasn't after a sweet bread.  It rose surprisingly quickly and has the most delightful, soft, fluffy yet substantial texture.  I could not be happier or more impressed.

I now know why after nearly 2,500 reviews, this bread is rated 5 stars...it's because it's GOOD!  It's exactly the sandwich and toast bread that I was looking for with the perfect texture.  I seriously doubt that I'll ever buy white bread again.

This has been a very easy bread to make. Just brushed it for looks with egg yolk wash. Came out lovely and soft and is a great sweet bread! Will go in my bread rotation!

If you live in a cooler climate and are having trouble getting a good first and/or second rise...put an 8x8 pan filled with boiling water in the bottom of your oven. Put your mixing bowl (covered with a damp towel) on the second lowest shelf. Close the oven - wait an hour. Best way I've found to rise bread during a New England winter :)

This is an excellent recipe if you don't have butter.
Tastes great for sandwiches. If you use a BREAD MACHINE, just cut recipe in half and put the wet ingredients in first. Turned out perfect.

This bread is okay, however I personally don't prefer white bread. The recipe by itself, makes a dense flavorless bread (in my opinion). However, in making 2 loaves, I changed 1 cup of flour for a cup of corn meal, and another cup of flour out for a cup of instant potatoe flakes. I cannot begin to say how good this bread is!

Based on the original recipe, even the first two times I made it, both time I found it to get two dry. I only realized later it needed less flour.

None the less, the addition of the bread flakes and corn meal gave it some real nice flavor and texture! :)

l love this bread, l make it all the time. lt is the best bread receipe, ever. l will only make this kind of bread because it comes out perfect all the time, moist and so very rich in flavour. No fuss, no muss, you are done in no time when you make this bread, l have also made this bread into a cinnamon bread, 2 tbsp. butter~ 1/2 cup brown sugar~ 1& a 1/2 tsp.  of cinnamon ~ Yummmy! lt is so good and tastes even better when you toast this bread, this receipe will be here to stay for a life time!

This is an awesome loaf of bread! I used less sugar for the loaves. But when I used this dough for cinnamon rolls I used the full 2/3 cup. An amazing, tasty and versatile recipe. Thank you!

Fantastic!  I always follow directions exactly the first time I try it and I did with this one.  It is a bit sweet and I do like that, but not for everyday bread.  Next time I will lower the amount of sugar to make it a bit more versatile.

This bread came out perfect, not dense at all. As a matter of fact, it pretty much exploded when rising in the loaf pans. I ended up with an airy, moist, tender bread. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar as suggested by other viewers which in my opinion left it lacking a little in taste. As is, it would be perfect for a sandwich bread (I don't usually bake bread to use as sandwich bread); I normally make bread to eat buttered as part of our meal. I think next time I will use more sugar to get the sweeter flavor or use 1/4 cup of sugar again and add some herbs instead to enhance the flavor. I will definitely make again. Even though I want to enhance the flavor some, I still think this is a 5 star plus recipe.

After starting to make this bread, I realized that I only had 1 1/2 cups bread flour.  I used whole wheat flour for the rest, added 1/4 cup of honey to compensate for that much ww flour, and it was great.  Very sweet, so I would cut out the white sugar if I make it ww again.

Easy recipe to follow. I halved it and made one loaf. I reduced the sugar, based on some other comments. If I repeat this recipe, I will reduce the sugar further.

this is the first time ive made bread and it was perfect. husband and kid approved, a great fool proof recipe. i baked one and froze the second before the second rise and after i shaped it into a loaf and it also baked up perfect. we no longer buy loaf bread its so good.

update- ive been making this bread for almost a year and it been that long since we bought bread. ive found new ways to use this recipe. i roll out the dough and sprinkle light brown sugar, cinnamon and pecan. also roll out and cut into yeast rolls. awsome with some butter and honey on top. each of these freeze well after shaped before the 2nd rise as well. its handy to have all these in the freezer to use as needed. i thaw in the fridge overnight and lay out to rise in the am then bake. ill be having my 3rd child soon and will be stocking the freezer!

Amazing bread! This is a completely fail proof recipe. I didn't realize until I had started mixing the ingredients that I didn't have the right flour. I ended up using three cups all purpose flour and three cups self rising flour. Turned out great!

Fantastic! I did tweak it a bit. I used half super fine whole wheat flour and half white. Toned the sugar to 1/4 cup per reviews b/c I wanted more of a sandwich bread and it was great. It rose beautifully.  I'm new to baking and I've been trying to find a good keeper recipe and I think that I found it.

I'm pretty much a novice bread-maker, and this turned out perfectly for me. The inside was soft and fluffy while the outside was crunchy and golden. Following others' suggestions, I reduced the sugar to about 1/3 cup. I'll probably try the full sugar amount sometime if I'm looking for more of a dessert than sandwich bread. 
I also brushed the top with an egg and water mixture, so that gave a waxy texture to the top, and made sure to turn the pan around halfway through to ensure even browning.

I'll definitely be using this recipe again, especially since it can be made within an evening.

Easy to make a delicious.  Today was the first day I have EVER made homemade bread, and it took about 4 hours (I made 3 different recipes).  I made mini-loafs, and should have reduced cooking time by probably about 5 or 10 minutes.

This was an easy recipe and my bread came out beautifully. I did how ever make a mistake and used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 2/3. Asked for suggestions from AR members about the sugar as usual they came through. I will definately make this again, but I will cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. Great recipe!!

Made two nice loaves. Not too dense and not too light and airy. I followed another reviews advice and used 1/4 cup sugar to have a less sweet bread since I'm using for tomato sandwiches. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

So amazing! This is the only bread recipe I use now! For sweet bread (which I like to eat right out of the oven with lots of butter!), I add about 1/3 cup + 2 Tblspns of honey. For sandwich bread, I only use 1/4 c of sugar. The best part is, it's vegan so my whole family can eat it! Thank you so much for posting!!

PS: If you are using a bread machine, put the salt in AFTER the flour so your dough can rise better. I use the dough setting and then take it out and bake it in the oven for 25 minutes. Happy baking!

I can't rate the original recipe because I made changes, so this rating is for the altered recipe. I used 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and 3 cups whole wheat flour and 3 cups bread flour. Other than that, I followed the recipe and the bread came out wonderfully chewy and a little bit sweet, great for toast or sandwiches!

I have been making this bread for years - it's a family favorite and at one point was the only bread we were eating (yes - I was making bread 2-3 times per week).  Nowadays, I have altered the bread recipe a bit and I still make it 2-3 times a week - it's a staple around our house.  This recipe is very forgiving - I have used all-purpose flour, bread flour, white wheat flour, and stone ground white wheat flour (the latter being our favorite).  I have also replaced the sugar with 1/2 cup honey and I use butter instead of oil.  Oh, and I also replace 1 tablespoon of the flour with 1 tablespoon of potato flour - makes for a very soft bread.  I make the dough in the bread maker and bake it in the oven.  The only complaint around here is the size of the slices - much too big for sandwich bags for lunches!

OK, I'm going to be that guy and rate this based on what I made from it (and how I anticipate it will be after a few more changes), even though I modified the recipe. Anyway, I was looking for a simple sandwich bread, so this recipe with a few simple mods was PERFECT! I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup per prior reviews. I think that was just right. Then, I replaced 2 cups of white flour with wheat flour. It came out with excellent texture and a great, but slightly bland flavor. Bland is ok though, remember I'm making sandwich bread. Anyway, next time, I plan to replace another cup of white flour with a cereal mix to add some crunchies to the bread, because that's what we like. Then this will be my family's new sandwich bread!

Can I rave about this bread?  I made one batch (two loaves) for the farmers' market this week.  Fortunately, one didn't sell, so I got to eat it!  It was delicious.  Sweet, but not too sweet and soft and light - perfect sandwich bread.  I ate mine with butter and homemade marmalade.  Best yet, since I normally make my dough in the bread machine, this allowed me to make two loaves by hand while my Light Oat Bread (from this site) was churning in the machine.  I don't do a lot of bread by hand, so I was pleased with how amazing this bread turned out.  Give it a try, you won't buy sandwich bread ever again!

Awesome! This is my first time making bread (other than pizza dough) and it turned out perfect. It is moist and a little sweet and great for sandwiches or with jam. I am making my second loaf today as a gift to my parents. I think they will love it!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and this bread turned out soooo good! I did in my bread machine on the dough cycle then split into two. One half I made the bread with and the other I made cinnamon rolls with. Both came out delicious! Highly recommend this recipe.

Came out perfect!  But, need to put it in for a little longer than 30 minutes.  I would reduce the temp after 30 minutes to 325 to finish baking center and not burn the top.

Mixed in the breadmaker shaped in pan, thanks! Makes a terrific loaf of sandwich bread, cooled immediately on the rack. I make 4 loaves of bread and 2 pans of rolls from this recipe (I make it all on the same day). I use 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 4 cups of white. The bread freezes well and toasts well too. After years of making homemade bread this is our family's favorite recipe.

I make this all the time. Simple and good. I sometimes put less sugar if I want it less sweet and sometimes I add some spices for a different flavor. The recipe as is, is great! A little sweet. I love it that way! But if that's not what you're looking for, reduce the sugar.

This was my first attempt at homemade bread....LOVED IT!  So did everyone else.  I went to the store today and bought more yeast so I can make more... we are already down to a half a loaf :)

I only cooked it 20 minutes because I was afraid the crust would be too crunchy.  It was too soft in the very middle pieces, but still good.  Definately cook it the full 30 minutes!

Great bread!  Super easy recipe!  Thanks!

I love baking from scratch and have made a lot of breads from different recipes.  I have to say this is the very best one I've tried.  My husband and I both loved the bread.  I will continue to make this bread regularly.  It's great for sandwiches, meals, etc...just sweet enough.

I can not give this bread enough stars.  No more store brought bread, this is all my family wants now. I did cut the sugar in half, only because Mom is diabetic and said it was too sweet. Either way, it is a very good bread.

Great recipe.  This is my go-to bread recipe.  I make it all the time, even into rolls.  I always use all purpose flour and the finished product is amazing.  Baking this bread on a cold winter morning makes the house smell so home-made.  If I could give this recipe 10+ stars, I would.

Amazing bread, easy and fast. I use this for rolls, bread, french loafs and hoagies, just the best ever. I do not add all the flour, it turns out fluffier that way for hamburger buns ext.

I made this bread one day when the roads were so bad, I couldn't get to the store for bread.  It is wonderful bread and fairly easy to make.  My Mother was even impressed, and she is a wonderful cook.  This bread has great texture and flavor.

I guess this would be okay if you like really, really dense sweet bread.....also, 30 minutes was NOT enough time to bake....the center was still doughy.  

I'll be looking for another bread recipe.  this one was a waste of my ingrediants

Way to much salt! I will cut back to 2 tsp. as another person suggested. Also, Not sure why the oven gets preheated to 425 degrees just to turn around and cook it at 350 Degrees. I will make again but will change the above mentioned.

I had a terrible time getting the dough to rise, even after 2 hours. I have been making bread by hand for a long time, and rarely have I had this problem. My yeast is fresh- I make bread 4 times a week- I know that's not the cause. Even taking in consideration butter instead of oil, it should have doubled in bulk after two hours in a warm spot. Finally I kneaded in more yeast, and that gave it a little oomph to get working, but not nearly enough where I could say it was doubled in size. This leads to a dense loaf, which is okay, but not really what I desired. I wanted to like this recipe, I wanted it to work, but I just couldn't get it to do that. So I'm giving it two stars, I'm sorry.

Super easy and super yummy.  I did not change anything, I only cut the recipe in half to make only one loaf.  That little bread grew a lot more in the oven, and I like it more than the Amish bread I get at my local market.

I made 4 loaves of this bread this morning and they came out perfect! I halfed the sugar to cut calories and it was still awsome. It is a sweet bread but not like cake more like the mexican sweet rolls i was raised on. It is everything i wanted! Super easy and hard to screw up!

Oh my was I surprised! I was determined to find a recipe that was similar to store bought white bread that my son & step son would use for sandwiches. DH didn't think homemade bread could come out as soft but this recipe is what I was looking for! I avoided this recipe because DH can't have white flour breads and I'm not a fan of it - but like I mentioned son & step son prefer it - and now I can make it as needed - was very pleasantly surprised :)

Hands down the best bread recipe I've ever tried.
I've made it several times and each time tried something a little different. Every time it was wonderful.
I've determined I like it best with 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 cup wheat germ subbed for 1/2 c of flour.  My next batch I am trying w/milk.  Next tries I'll be adding whole wheat flour.

Very Easy to make using my Kitchenaid mixer! Tastes wonderful! I make it completely in the mixer bowl, let it rise the first rising in the mixer bowl, punch it down and put it in bread pans. Let rise again and bake!

Updated review. The first THREE times I made this, it was a total failure. I made bricks. However, on the 4th try I ditched my kitchen aid mixer and just did it by hand. EUREKA - SUCCESS! Since then I have made it a couple more times and it has worked out quite well.

It is a lovely, soft, white bread. Exactly what the recipe says it is. Plain. What it isn't: full of artisanal flavor, bakery crust. This is not the recipe if you are looking for those qualities. But if you need a reason to stop buying store brand white bread, this is definitely it.

I just printed for 5 servings; as my bread machine only takes 1 1/3 cups of flour.  Will post results after baked and tasted. Looking forward to baking this as soon as I get off the computer. Will be using my Just for Dinner Bread machine.  West Bend. UPDATE***for taste and texture grade only.  
Texture good, taste good, but came out not so good shape.  Will have to try again, using more yeast.  My regular bread machine recipe calls for 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar.

I did my first attempt on this bread and it was a total fail.. I didn't even get to baking the bread since the dough was too dry and dense. I followed the recipe exactly - I triple check my measurements on everything (And weigh out things like flour and sugar) and yet there was WAY too much Bread Flour. Even before I was halfway through adding the flour I could tell the dough was going to be very heavy - more like a tough pizza dough. I will try again later (Less flour, maybe switch to All-purpose or self-raising) but I was really looking forward to this recipe. Hopefully it will work out next time with some adjustments.

We love this Bread. I also replace the all purpose flour with wheat flour add a table spoon of honey, one and a half teaspoon of cinnamon and fold in raisins. This will make the best raisin bread EVER!

A very simple, very tasty recipe that produced two fluffy, delicious loaves of bread.  I only managed to use 5C of flour before my stand mixer threatened to mutiny, and I still wound up with two *large* loaves.    I used 1/4C of sugar, which seemed to be just the right amount of sweetness.    The loaves were a shade on the bland side, so next time I'll increase the amount of salt and maybe try substituting melted butter for the vegetable oil to give a bit more flavour to the bread.  Definitely one of the better bread recipes I've ever tried!

Love this bread recipe- it is a lot like my great-grandmother's recipe (the only exception is that she used 1/3 c sugar and lard in place of the oil)  I made this into 1 loaf and 1 batch of cinnamon rolls. Great versatile recipe. Turned out perfect the first time. Delicious.

I just finished making this bread today, and it is simply delicious. It was very easy to make following the recipe exactly.  The texture was soft like sandwich bread from the store. The dough rose perfectly and I was amazed that such a simple bread recipe could turn out so outstanding.  My husband loves it. This will be my number one white bread recipe from now on! Thank you for submitting it.

Okay made this again and had to edit my review to include:  I reduced the sugar as other reviewers suggested just to see.  Oh my word!!  Probably even more delicious, if that is possible.  & I have a sweet tooth the size of Texas and even loved the sweetness of the original recipe.  Make this, you wont be sorry.

Very delicious and super easy!!  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and thought it still had a great texture that we loved.  My rising times were longer but it could have been due to it being a very cold day.  To help it along,  I had the dough raise in the oven with the light on and boiling water.  The taste of this bread is so yummy, we ate it without anything on it even.  I will definitely be making it again.  I may reduce the sugar as some other reviewers have recommended.  I loved the sweet taste but don't necessarily need that sweetness for a good sandwich.

Every year for Christmas Eve Breakfast we have Sausage Cheese Bread.  I normally make some for gifts and end up just getting a 5 pack of frozen bread dough.  This year I just made one for us so I decided to try making the dough myself.  I cut the recipe in half, let the dough double and then punched in down and rolled it out in a rectangle.  I sprinkled it with 1 lb. of cooked ground sausage (still warm) and 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. I skipped the second raising.  With the warm sausage all I had to do was roll, place seam side down on a greased cookie sheet and start the oven. Once pre-heated just pop it in and bake as specified.  A couple fried eggs on top made it even better.  I won't buy bread dough ever again....even if I bake this for gifts next year.  Thanks Peg!

Sweet and soft.  The crust was a bit dense for me.  A classic white bread that I'll probably make again someday.

This recipe is pretty much foolproof. Once you get past the "My water was too hot, I forgot to add sugar, my water was too cold" issues that come along with self-learning how to proof yeast, it's pretty easy sailing. I read a few articles about breadmaking before I tried it out, and I had no problems with it. I let it rise for about half an hour after the first hour it's suppose to, I just kept letting it rise. Also, I found that working on an electric heating pad (Like to keep your feet warm) made the yeast proof well and made the dough rise excellently. It also made it easy to control the temperature; not too hot or too cold. Just a thought for anyone who's having trouble. For even more control, you can use a candy thermometer to keep track of the temp of the dough. It helps me at least.

I used Luvz2bake's suggestions and I love how easy this recipe is with a mixer. It always turns out. I also make this as honey whole wheat recipe by replaceing the sugar with honey and the bread flour with whole wheat. It also turns out great.

I used 2 cups sweet lager instead of water to give this a kick, and it turned out AMAZING. Maybe not so Amish anymore though, lol.

So easy to bake, and makes the greatest sandwiches.  This was the first bread recipe that I ever tried, and it turned out great on the first try.  Now I make it all the time, to the point where I've stopped buying bread at the store.

You will NEVER FIND A BETTER BREAD RECIPE THAN THIS ONE!  I make loaves for the bread ministry at our Church.  I followed this recipe to the letter except for slicing a slit down the center of the top (to make it pretty) before baking and spraying it with Crisco oil spray before baking for a beautiful color and then as soon as I took it out of the oven I sprayed it with spray butter - Oh it tastes so good and it's picture perfect!  Perfect bread!  Praise the Lord for the person that shared it and for how it turns out!  So easy too!!

Delicious! First attempt overflowed the breadmachine...I'd misread and thought it was a different recipe...finished it off in the oven...YUM! Second attempt, I halved the recipe, made it in the bread machine and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil; used 1c whole wheat flour + 2c bread flour instead of 3c bread flour...tasted even better!!

Iwas looking for a bread that didn't use milk or bread when I found this.  I didn't have anything but all-purpose flour, so I made it anyway.  I also didn't want a sweet bread, so I reduced the sugar by half.  What incredibly good bread!  It rose beyond my expectations and yielded light fluffy loaves with a texture similar to commercial bread.  It makes the most amazing toast.  My husband told me (in between bites)  not to loose this recipe!  Thanks for the post.

I have been making this every weekend for months!  I do use half the sugar and plain white flour and its perfect, which is a HUGE accomplishment for me!  I've only made bread successfully in bread machines - and that sometimes failed miserably.  We may never have store bought bread again!

I made 2 changes:  First I cut the amount of sugar in half, secondly I added about 1/2 cup of instant potato flakes.  I find adding potato flakes keeps the bread fresher longer.  It was excellent.

Very good!  Especially good hot out of the oven with butter.  Most recipes for bread do not always turn out that well.  Have made a few times.  Much better than bread machine or frozen bread doughs.  Neice, nephew, and I loved! Thank you for submitting!

I got volunteered to send monkey bread for my son's Christmas breakfast tomorrow, so I was trying to find a good recipe instead of buying it already made.  I hate the canned biscuit kind, and the only recipe I found from scratch involved a bread machine. So I found this recipe and combined it with the Monkey Bread II recipe on this site.  I made a test one last night, and it's almost gone.  I can't believe how easy this bread recipe is.  It was wonderful, soft and perfect.  After following the recipe all the way up to dividing into two loaves before the second rise, I then pull pieces of one loaf and rolled them in cinnamon and brown sugar and butter and dropped them into a bundt pan, let it rise for another 30 minutes then baked it for about 25 minutes.  It is excellent. I'm making the second one now, for the class tomorrow.  I'm tweaking this one by increasing the sugar and cinnamon, and coating the pan in butter and brown sugar first to make a caramel glaze when I turn it out of the pan.   I will be making this bread again, as regular white bread.  Forgot to add that I was out of bread flour, so I used all purpose flour and 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten (have no idea why I had this on hand, but glad I did).  Also, this was my FIRST time making bread by hand without my bread machine that I can not find since we moved 5 years ago.

I made one loaf, half the recipe, using 2 Tablespoons of sugar after reading the reviews and this bread turned out perfect! I used the dough setting on my bread machine, forming the loaf and doing the second rise and baking it off in the oven. The yield was a very large loaf that was very moist and had a beautiful crumb. If you want a nice soft white bread, try this recipe. I think I will make it again this week using all the sugar called for in the recipe and use it for cinnamon rolls.

Love this recipe, this bread has the BEST texture!  I use this recipe for cinnamon bread.  I roll it out into a rectangle and sprinkle generously with cinnamon-sugar and then roll it up from the short end.  I put it in a bread pan and let it raise and then bake.  Much better than the store-bought cinnamon breads!!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used all purpose flour and it turned out very lite and fluffy. Don't use a bread machine and try to "feel" when it turns from sticky to smooth. it only took me about 4 and a half to 5 cups of flour to get there plus the flour on my hands and surface to keep stickiness down. I proofed the first rise in the oven with damp kitchen towel and oiled bowl. I turned the oven on until it felt warm inside and turned it off. (My house stays at 74 F)I also hand shape my loaves baked together on 13 x 9 deep-sided baking pan. Best bread recipe I've tried on here so far.

This was my first time baking bread, and it turned out amazing.  I don't have a mixer, so mixing the dough by hand took a while. My husband and son loved it.  I just made it yesterday, and one loaf is already gone.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was my first time making bread-ever. I was questioning myself throughout the entire process; sure I had messed up in one of the steps. I was SO wrong...this bread came it perfectly delicious! Nice crust on the outside, and soft and delicious on the inside. I cannot wait to make it again:) Thank you for posting a recipe that helped me to accomplish one of my goals; the skill of making my own bread.

Best bread recipe to date. Many breads I've tried ended up with a super hard crust and way too soft inside, resulting in me crushing the bread while trying to delicately slice it. This is soft and spongy and a nice little sweet taste to it. The crust is not hard (finally!!). I'm sticking to this recipe from now on.

I've been making this for awhile now & we love this bread!  I mix & knead it with my KA mixer but it's pretty stiff so I usually add one egg.  Although all white flour does taste best, I sometimes sub 2c ww flour which is good too.  I've tried it with 3c ww flour & didn't like it at all!  If you don't have bread flour, AP flour works well too.  Thanks Peg, for a great recipe!

I made this recipe today.  The only substitution I made was using extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut down each of my loaves a bit and made six dinner rolls along with the two loaves.  I did let the bread rise a bit longer for the both the first and second rises.  It made 2 fantastic loaves of bread with a most excellent crumb.  The rolls came out even better if that's possible.  I would up with six dinners with the texture of a baguette.  I was so psyched.  This will definitely be my new go to recipe for bread.  I want to try this recipe with baguettes sometime.  Highly recommended.

Great recipe and easy for novice bread makers. I did take others advice and used my KA mixer with the dough hook- 5 min. on medium made great dough! Since others had said they made rolls, but left no directions, I looked at other recipes. I used a 9 inch pie plate, sprayed it with non stick spray. I cut the dough in half, using one half for bread and the other for rolls. I cut it into 12 equal pieces and rolled them up and put them in the pie plate. I baked them for about 18 minutes and they were great! Next time, it will be rolls only! Thanks for the great recipe!

I really really wanted to give this 5 stars, but I didn't follow the recipe as written. Like many others, I reduced the sugar down to 1/4 cup, and it was the perfect amount. I brushed the loaves with butter before and right after baking, which made for a really delicious crust. I also put a pot of steaming water on the lower rack, as I do most times I make bread. This makes for a pretty, crisp crust. The only real issue I had was that it never rose above the pan. Still delicious though! We love it! **Just want to add- not sure if all the complaints of denseness are because of the amount of sugar, but I did reduce the sugar and my loaves turned out perfectly fluffy. Really great texture!

This was really good and easy. I did cut the sugar down due to other reviewers and it still had a nicely sweet taste. I used mostly allpurpose flour as that's all I had. I am not a fan of really dense breads but store is so much air, this is a nice inbetween. Will be making more!

Oh! My! Goodness!  As novice bread-baker, but longtime baker of all other sweets, I can tell you this recipe is foolproof.  I've always been intimidated by the art of baking bread, but this has propelled me into this new adventure headfirst!  What a rush!  My first concern was that I didn't have bread flour & had to use allpurpose instead.  As a result, I could not incorporate all 6 cups.  The dough took about 5 3/4 cups of all purpose flour, and I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, but the remaining ingredients were unchanged. I baked one loaf & a pan of rolls - glazed them with an egg wash & left a pan of water in the oven during the baking time to ensure a nice, crisp crust (a steph I've noticed in other recipes for bread).   The result was extraordinary! Both my kids tore into a roll, fresh out of the oven.  My daughter asked if we can bake fresh bread everyday from now on.  My son didn't say much as his mouth was too full of bread. Thank you so much for this recipe - it's definitely a keeper!

I didn't have bread flour so I added a spoonful of gluten to all-purpose flour.  Very good, sweet, plain white bread.  Even pickies like it.

Excellent.  I converted it to make in a bread machine.  Substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Bread is spectacular and a keeper.  Inexpensive to make as well.

My family absolutely loved this bread. The first loaf was gone within a few hours, and the second didn't last through the next day. I read through other reviews before making it, so I cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup. It was still sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. It's an extremely easy recipe, which is great since I'm a complete novice in the kitchen, and has come out perfectly every time.

This is a great, simple recipe for white bread. I used my kitchen aid mixer and followed the suggestions left by another reviewer (i.e., once all dry ingredients are in let it mix for 5 min on medium). It turned out spectacular.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and the bread is still fairly sweet. This will be my staple recipe for white bread. Thanks.

I like this recipe for certain things like raisin, cinnamon or walnut bread, but as a table bread it's a bit too sweet for my taste.  I cut the recipe in half and put the ingredients in my bread machine on dough cycle with 2 1/4 tablespoons of yeast.  When cycle is complete I roll it out with a rolling pin into rectangle, brush with melted butter, sprinkle brown sugar and then add nuts, raisins, whatever and roll it up into a bread pan and bake when it has risen again 1/2 inch over top of pan.  A great breakfast bread.

Great as written but much bettr if you use MILK instead of water.  I always substitute milk in any recipe where water is called for.  The milk lends a richer taste and helps retain moisture in the bread.  Make sure the milk is warm too before adding to the flour.

I bake a lot of different breads and love trying new recipes.  I read the reviews on this one and it sounded so promising.   I think the mistake was that the recipe says bread flour (which is DIFFERENT than all purpose or self rising flour) and that made it the consistency of pizza crust...dense and very chewy.  On a positive note...If you reduce the sugar to 1/4 instead of 2/3 of a cup, you get a tasty dough for pizza crust.

This bread was so good!  After reading the other reviews, I was skeptical about the sweetness of the bread, but decided to use the recipe as-is.  We couldn't get enough of it!  It is better than my grandmother's bread!  Perfect straight from the oven with butter.

The only addition I can come up with is as follows:  When proofing the yeast, only add two tablespoons of sugar to the mixture; also add just a dash of vinegar to the mixture if you have soft water.  Yeast like and acidic atmosphere.  We also copensated whole wheat pastry flour for a quarter of the flour for more tenderness, also adding a tad bit more water for the whole wheat.  Other wise the recipe is wonderfull!  P.S. Don't overwork it or you'll end up with flat bread, which is also excelent!  Good luck all!

Magnificent recipe for a delightfully sweet, moist, and dense bread.  A great sandwich bread, keeps for a few days (if one manages not to eat it in that time), excellent for crispy-on-the-outside-moist-on-the-inside toast.  It is perfect for dinner rolls; I also enjoy making a few doughnuts with the extra scraps after forming my loaves - just fry and douse with cinnamon & sugar!  I find that I add an extra 1-2 cups of flour during kneading because the dough is very sticky otherwise.  The rising time varies with different yeasts and approximated water temps, but the rule of thumb I use with this dough is simply to monitor its rising cycles rather than to go by time. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 5 stars because I followed the recipe exactly and it came out like it should have.  I found it to be bland and tasteless, though, and won't make it again.  That is not the fault of the recipe.

I tried this recipe the way it is written, well--opps on my part the 1st was with all-purpose flour was okay but dense. My mistake. Then 2nd time with the bread flour---just perfect, light and sweet. Also made a 3rd batch in the same day, and took the suggestion from breadguy to use only 2 tablspoons of sugar and tasted wonderful as well like a white yeasted bread. Totally satisfied with the recipe and WILL make this again. 2 thumbs up from the rest of the family. Thank you.

One of the Best breads I have ever eaten.  However, I edited it the first time I made it (partially on accident) and it was much better that time.  I only used about 1/2 cup of sugar and cut the yeast back to 2 teaspoons.  It made a very moist bread.  If it is made that way you can cut very thin delicious slices.  PERFECT!  The second time I made it I used the full amount of yeast and couldn't cut it as thin and it dried out much quicker.

This bread was great. I've been trying to get my breads right (and edible) for years, and they never work for me. I did almost everything in my kitchen aid mixer (I barely had to touch the dough) I will lessen the amount of sugar though next time (and I'll try replacing with honey for a healthier subsitute). I also added about 3/4 c of skim milk powder in place of same amount of flour. The milk powder gives a tastier bread (a bread makers secret).

It was delicious! I can't believe it that my first time baking bread resulted in such heavenly loaves. I've since made this recipe several more times - it easily turns into individual mini loaves and heavenly buns! My mom's also turned it into a whole wheat variety too... An absolutely awesome recipe - thanks for sharing!

So easy and so good!  I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 as some had suggested.  We gobbled the first loaf up right away, but I am reserving the second loaf for french toast in the morning, yum!

I used this recipe as my first serious attempt and home made, non-bread machine bread, and the outcome gets better and better each time I make it.  I have made this recipe at least once a week over the last 6 weeks and have found the following changes have made the perfect bread: I use a half Better for Bread white flour, and half Whole Wheat flour.  I add 1 teaspoon extra yeast for a fluffier wheat bread and I substitute the sugar for 1/2 cup dried honey (found in a local helth food/cooking store). I also increased the temp to 375 degrees. The outcome is soft, fluffy, Honey Wheat bread that makes great sandwiches and the most wonderful french toast.

The best recipe.  I make it almost every other night now!  I also play around with the recipe!  I made an italian version and a sun dried tomato version.  Just add dried garlic, garlic power and italian herb when mixing in the flour.  Finish it off with egg wash, dried garlic, herb and parmesan cheese.  For the tomato one, I used the oil that come with the sun dried tomato instead of veggie oil and add sun dried tomato...yum yum yum!  If you don't want the bread to be so dense, let it rise a little longer or punch it down and let it rise again!  It will give you a fluffier bread !!!!

Good bread! Different than I expected, but still tasty.  My kids love it!  Made it as directed but didn't find it to be all that sweet as others have (love sweets though).  I added a wash before baking, using 2 egg yolks thinned with milk and a little honey.  Just brush it on while you're waiting for the oven to heat.  Makes the top brown nicely.

This is a great recipe and very easy.  I have substituted 2 cups of the white flour with whole wheat flour and it is great.  I just let the yeast proof a little longer and and the the dough takes a little longer to rise but it comes out great.  I also reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

Outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using only 1/3 cup of sugar.  It was an easy recipe to follow and my family loved it!  The only issue I had was it took over double the time to rise - even though I had it in a warm oven.  Next time I think I will try it with quick rise yeast and see if that speeds the process up.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Happy Valentine's Day!!! Bah Humbug...while everybody was getting flowers and candy I got loaf pans ... my son and his wife got me two, my stepson got me two also and my husband got me another. It is all your fault... all the good reviews I had to try this recipe, it is just so easy and tasty and the consistancy is so full of flavor and substance I have traded my baseball cap for an Amish lace cap...chuckle...chuckle and I did get flowers all purpose and 25 lbs of bread flower. Since I tried it the first time we have not bought white bread just loaf pans. Thank you for sharing it with me.

Okay, I must have made this bread more than 50 times now.  People flip out for this stuff.  It's good for everything, french toast, grilled cheese, sandwiches, garlic toast, and makes good bread crumbs.  This is a hard recipe to get away from.  I always want to try a different loaf bread, but I keep coming back to this one.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it's forever in my memory and I know I'll be making it for many years to come.

Awesome recipe!  Followed the instructions for the KitchenAid Mixer users, and used only 2T sugar--Also, used Bread Machine Yeast (it was in the fridge), in the amount suggested, and it just kept rising!  I used mini loaf tins, and weighed the dough at .75 lb per tin (made 4 loaves and a smaller loaf) I will try less next time, as the tops of the bread were huge! (cute though!).  
I also tossed icecubes in the bottom of the oven throughout the cook time to provide a crusty exterior to the bread--terrific!

Perfect with the blue-ribbon chili recipe from this site, as well as with the fluffy french toast recipe.  This will be my go-to white bread recipe...THANKS!

This is a great recipe.  It was quite easy to follow and I used it the very first time I ever made bread.  The loaf was very fluffy and soft and I even made small bread rolls. It was just a bit too sweet. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent bread and so very easy and quick to make. I used 1/4 cup of sugar as others had suggested (I used Splenda instead), but will make it next time with the stated 2/3 cup. Definitely a recipe to keep!!

Want to make this bread even better - mix together oil and a good dash of paprika, about 5 minutes before the bread is done brush the oil mixture over the top and then sprinkle grated parmesan over the top and continue cooking for 5 minutes.

I sliced this thick to make French Toast. (I used the recipe from the red and white Better Homes and Garden cookbook). That was the best French Toast I have ever eaten.  I followed the directions as written and the bread came out beautifully.

I made only 1 change; I halved the sugar called for, only adding 1/3 cup and it was plenty sweet.  This recipe made two beautiful, huge, and delicious loaves of bread.  The dough was a little hard to work with at first, but came along pretty well.  After rising, I was amazed at how light and fluffy without holes.  Highly recommended.

OH MY GOODNESS. When I saw the rating for this bread, I knew I had to try it. I make homemade bread all the time, so I knew I could do it. This is a GREAT recipe. I didn't have bread flour, and it was a humid day, so I ended up using 7.5 cups of AP flour. It turned out AWESOME. When I was younger, I went to Lancaster Amish country in PA. This bread reminds me of that place so much. I love the touch of sweetness and will try it with all my favorite sandwiches. My daughter and I couldn't even wait for it to cool, we cut into one of the loaves 15 minutes after I took it out of the oven. Thank you for posting this recipe. It is PERFECT.

Update: I made this again with half white, half wheat flour. It was amazing again.

This is the best homemade bread I have ever tasted.  I can't believe I made it!  It was so easy too.  I started it at 3:30pm and had home baked bread on the table by supper!  My husband was in heaven.  Thank you, this one deserves more than five stars.

Oh my Gosh, I can make BREAD!! Whenever I let the dough sit/rise, I put the bowl in the oven, which was slightly heated. Make sure your yeast is alive and is really foamy and has risen a lot (my first attempt at making this, my yeast was dead and it barely changed at all--then I had problems with the dough and I ended up throwing it out). I cooked the bread in a glass loaf pan and it came out fine. Glorious bread. THANKS!

I LOVE this bread recipe! I follow it to the T, and it is wonderful.  Makes store-bought bread taste like *****. :)

I did use quick yeast one time with the bread (hubby did the shopping lol), and it was a lot trickier, and the finished product wasn't as smooth and tender.  I wouldn't recommend using fast-rise yeast.  As written the recipe is PERFECT.

This bread is totally awesome! I have made it about 20 times so far. It is so easy to make and it always comes out perfectly. My family absolutely loves it, especially my 2 year old son. He loves grilled cheese sandwiches but he won't eat them unless this bread is used! No more store bought bread for us!

Wonderful, sturdy, sweet.  Needs absolutely no topping when served.  Note: I found the recipe works better when dough is allowed to rise a bit longer than indicated (try time and a half.) When baked it rises more than 2 inches above the pan: beautiful and oh, the smell!  Thanks for a great recipe box staple!

Came out awesome after making bread quite a few times and messing every recipe up. Here is what I found out: 1)water that yeast is mixed into HAS to be at whatever temperature the recipe calls for. Too hot and it kills the yeast, too cool and the yeast won't foam up. 2)for perfect rising every time I heat oven up to 200 degrees. Turn oven OFF when it reaches 200 and immediately put bread dough in for one hour. I do not put a towel or anything over the bowl (make sure bowl is well oiled). If dough has not risen enough then leave in oven until it has. Make sure not to open the oven a bunch of times to see if dough has risen enough. The more you open the door the lower the temp in the oven will be for the rising dough. 3)make sure not to over knead the dough. For me this is a learning process of how the dough feels when it gets to the "done kneading" point. Knead it too much and the dough will be "tough". 4)when dividing the dough in half I used to pull dough apart in the middle and my loaves never looked right. I now use a pastry cutter (metal rectangle thingy) and just cut down the middle. 5)after dough is done rising DO NOT pull it out of the oven and sit it on counter to allow oven to heat up to 350 degrees (cooking temp). Leave the bread in while temp rises and cook for a few minutes less if the top begins to get too brown.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and did an egg white wash on top of the loaves and it came out perfect.

This is a great recipe to try- easy even for a novice to bread making.  I tried it several ways; with less sugar, with part wheat flour, etc.  Came out perfectly every time, even with several changes.  I do always have to cook it for about 40 minutes though, and let the second rise be about an hour before putting it into the oven.  I like the sweet taste from 2/3 cup sugar, but with 1/2 cup sugar it does taste more like plain white bread.  Have fun with your bread making!

I just love this recipe. I made it into rolls and took it down to my mother-in-laws for Christmas. DO NOT DO THIS! especially if you have an over powering mother-in-law. I had to freeze them, but still figured they would come out. Oh how foolish I was. They didn't get the proper thawin out time, or rasing time, not even the proper bake time. Sabitoging MIL. They were doughy in the middle, but the crust tasted great!
Upon returning home, I made them again. My husband protested, he said that he didn't think it would turn out, cuz of the experience at "moms". I just had to prove it was his "mom", not the bread. Well, YEPPERS I proved him wrong. I just love HOT bread fresh from the oven. Smothered in butter, topped with strawberry jam. I made half the dough into buns and my son claimed them for his sandwiches. We all love love love this recipe. Oh, so easy and sooooooo delish! I would definately rate it a 10-STAR! My hubby even said, "you're right this is good bread. We'll keep this one." I replied a big ol' DUUHH!

This is a nice hearty bread, but not too heavy.  Like others, I put 1/4 cup of sugar and used half wheat, half white flour. I live in Taiwan where it's not easy to get good bread, so I'm glad I found a recipe that comes out perfect every time.

I made this twice - the first with limited sugar and the second time with the called-for amount; my husband ignored the first batch and devoured the second!! This was my first successful loaf! I let the bread rise in a slightly preheated oven for both rises, and I let the second rise go for at least an hour. I also cover with plastic wrap, so I don't ruin a towel if it rises too far. I cook for 35 minutes and cover the bread with foil for the last 3 minutes. Very tasty- thank you!

Edited to say:
You really need to use the bread flour, not all purpose flour.  I tried two with bread flour and two with regular, and the ones with regular flour came out all wrong.  YOU MUST USE BREAD FLOUR or don't rate the recipe badly.

This is the first time i've made actual bread, though i've made everything else involving yeast.  Turned out great!  I could only find one loaf pan so I used an 8 inch cake pan for the other one.  I actually wished I had used both cake pans, as there were more "heels" with a round bread!  I don't find this recipe to be at all sweet, it's just fine.  My only problem was that the second rising took one hour instead of 30 minutes.  They rose better when I put them inside the turned off oven than when I had them on top.

This is a great basic white bread recipe.  It is perfectly sweet the way the recipe is written.  No changes here, just sprinkled a little coarse salt on the top and brushed with an egg wash.  Came out beautiful!  Thanks for the recipe, Peg.  I will make now on a regular basis.

This recipe was VERY easy even for the beginner bread baker like me.  I've made in with & without the bread machine. I've made in 3 times in the last month!! Husband loves it, kids love, neighbors love it.  Even made dinner rolls with it by placing 2-3 rolled dough balls into muffin tin cups.

One word, Wow!  This recipe turned out great.  I cut the sugar in half and it turned out perfect for sandwich bread.  I had never made bread before, but this recipe is pretty much fool proof.

My bread turned out great!  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of all white and used real maple syrup instead of oil and only put in a tbsp of sugar. They must have been delicious becasue both loaves disappeared in 2 days! :)

This is very good, and easy to make. It's not as sweet as I anticipated though! Especially with all the comments about how it was too sweet. I did only one loaf, and just under 1/4 cup of sugar. I think next time I will add a little more sugar, and brush some egg on top as another reviewer suggested. I will sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top of that as well and see how it turns out!

I thought this bread was very good and easy to make.  The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that my bread "fell" a bit after it finished raising in the loaf pans and I was putting it in the oven.  Not sure if that was my fault or not, but still, very yummy!

Waaaay too sweet. Really. Some recipes only call for a tablespoon of honey so I was unsure but followed the recipe. Hubby said if you added raisins it could be a sweet raisin bread, but even then it was too sweet for me. It cut fine, was a little dense and heavy but overall okay.

Very very good bread! Before I made this bread I thought how can just tweaking a few regular bread ingredients make such rave reviews?? Well I found out it definitely can! (and I don't recommend cutting the sugar before you've ever even made the bread yourself) I made doughnuts, dinner rolls, and cinnamon rolls with this dough and everyone of them was awesome!

This is the best bread I have ever had.  It was so sweet like a dinner roll and it had the best texture I've seen.   I did use 5 cups of all purpose flour instead.  I will be making bread more often now that I have this recipe.

Let it suffice that I took the time to register an account on this site just to say, "Thank you!" to the recipe's author and give this five stars. I bake all of our family's bread these days and this just became our new standard. I made two loaves; regular (per the instructions) and cinnamon sugar (melted butter, cinnamon, and a little brown sugar spread on the dough before shaping). I haven't tried the cinnamon yet, but the regular loaf is absolutely perfect. If you're thinking of trying this bread let me encourage you to follow the recipe to the letter for the first time. You can adjust the sugar later if you'd like, but it's not as sweet as some reviewers would lead you to believe. This bread is a dead ringer for what mom used to make and it's an excellent example of a heartland supper table staple.

Finally... a bread recipe that worked for me. I've tried and failed several other recipes and this one didn't turn out like a brick.

It took a lot longer than 30 minutes on the second rise to get 1" above the pan.

----

I've started using this recipe for cinnamon rolls and it works great!

After the first rise, I roll it out flat and apply melted butter, cinnamon and sugar in improvised quantities. Then I slice roll them into rolls and let them do the second rise. My family loves them!

YUMMY!!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Next time I'll reduce it to 1/3.  It was superb warm with honey on it--no butter needed!  Makes excellent toast!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! My six year old and I made this yesterday- it was a great rainy day activity.  We made one loaf plain and the other cinnamon swirl.  The cinnamon is gone already!  Even my picky husband liked it.

Very Nice. I halved the recipe, lessen the sugar and added slightly more flour to prevent sticking when kneading. Thanks!

This is pao dulce (Portuguese sweet bread) and also a base bread for pan de jamon (Venezuelan Christmas bread). As soon as I saw this recipe I knew instantly what it would taste like--soft, sweet and chewy. My father was a bread baker for over 20 years in Venezuela (he is originally from Portugal) and this bread was always in our house. I urge everyone who is thinking about making this to go ahead and try. It's very easy and the results are superb. Wow, I was flooded with memories as I was making this bread---everything from how to test the water temperature for the yeast to how to properly knead the dough and shape the loaves. Lovely memories indeed. Thank you Peg for submitting this!

I hadn't made homemade bread in years, and made it then with the help of my dad, so I wanted something easy to make.  This bread was very easy and very delicious!  I didn't have bread flour, so I used all purpose flour, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The bread was so good, my boyfriend and I both had seconds.  It is a bit sweet, which makes it great with butter on top and a glass of milk on the side.  It would also be a good bread for sandwiches if a bit less sugar was used.  Still perfect the way it is, though.

This bread turned out fabolicious!  I did change the sugar to 1/3 cup and added a little honey as well.  I did add half milk and half water.  Baking time was perfect.  Bakes up light and fluffy and can easily be cut into thin slices!

A great recipe to start baking with!  Mine turned out perfect for sandwich bread, not crumbly like others said.

You can make this more healthy by using whole wheat flour instead of regular flour and by only using one tablespoon of sugar instead of half a cup (use this sugar to proof the yeast).  

Also, you can leave out the oil.  However, make sure to use oil to line the baking sheet and the bowl that you let the bread rise in, otherwise the dough could dry out and stick to the pan.  

If you don't use any oil, make sure to steam the oven.  For the bread's second rise, you can place the dough in a cold oven with a pan of hot water on the bottom of the oven.  Leave the oven closed until the bread rises again.  Take the bread out, preheat the oven, and put the bread back in with the pan of water.  This adds moisture to the dough: the lack of oil will make the bread dry out otherwise.

This was my first attempt at baking bread.  I was petrified at several steps, but eventually both loaves turned out gorgeous and tasty.  I used a little more than half the sugar called for and that worked out fine. I wasn't prepared for the dough to be so crumbly upon the first kneading, but was reassured after the rise (which took 1.5-2 hours in my cold and drafty kitchen).  I will bake again!  Thanks!

This recipe reminds me of childhood.  I can't remember how many times I came home from school on a rainy Oregon day to warm loaves of homemade bread.  I've given yeast bread a few half-hearted attempts over the years, but haven't had much success.  My bread turns out heavy and flat with a tough bottom crust.  I had pretty much given up hope when I decided to try this recipe.  I did misread the recipe, using 1 1/2 tsp (One yeast packet) but I didn't even realize it until the bread was done, and it had baked up light, fluffy and fabulous anyway.  I thought it a bit odd that others said they would use a loaf of bread for a gift, but after making this I can't wait to do the same.  Thank you, Peg, for making me a bread maker, and for the lovely reminders of more carefree days!

This bread was incredible!  I made it with my 5 year old in a Kitchen Aid mixer.  I used all-purpose flour and the loaves rose and cooked beautifully into very light, very tasty bread.  I too reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and served a hot loaf with a cinnamon-honey butter (about 1 cup Country Crock,  2 T honey and 1-2 tsp. cinnamon).  We will definately be making this again!

I used this recipe with the directions for the Microwave English Muffin bread to cook it in the microwave.  I dried the cooked bread out overnight and made homemade Panko breadcrumbs.  I tasted a bit of the bread before drying out and it was delish! Next time I'll cook half of it the traditional way to enjoy for sandwiches.

I use the dough to make cinnamon rolls more often than using it for plain bread. It's pretty sweet for just bread so I usually don't add as much sugar if I'm going to use it for loaves, but this is so easy to make that I rarely use any other white bread recipe.

Simply delicious, quick and easy, never have I had yeast bread to turn out the first time until I tried this recipe.  Everyone loves the taste and texture.  I made rolls instead of the loaf bread. I come from a large family, and they all agreed that these are a must for all the holiday/family get together meals. Thanks so much for sharing this with us.

Thank you for this beyond tasty and easy bread recipe.  I was so glad it made two loaves because it didn't last long. I am 15 and I found this bread very quick and easy to make. I can't wait to make this again! Good Luck!

I love this recipe! The taste is great! But according to the directions the bread seems to come out dense. I work in a bakery as a pastry chef and just recently started making bread. It had been on my "wish list" of things to make in a while. I made the bread according to bread guys KA mixer instructions, except, after first rise I rolled my dough out into a long rectangle and rolled it up like a cinnamon roll. Then I tucked the two ends under and set for the second rise. I put the pans on my stove with the oven on. It keeps it warm. After a half an hour it didn't look fluffy enough so I waited another half an hour. It was big and stood about an inch above my pan. So let your bread rise for an hour instead on just 30 minutes and it will come out fluffy and not dense! Enjoy!

I always braid my loaves, which gives it a professional and impressive look-- if I'm making some to go with dinner I'll bake a braided free-form loaf on a cookie sheet, so it can either be sliced or pulled apart. For yeast packet users-- I used to open a few packets and measure out 1 1/2 tablespoons, but one time I was in a rush and just used two packets without measuring. It came out perfect, so that's what I do every time now. I've also always used all-purpose flour rather than bread flour, and I've never had an issue. It is fairly sweet, which I love, but if you prefer your bread a bit more savory I might consider reducing the sugar (as I've seen other reviewers suggest). I used this recipe when I was just starting to learn about baking bread, and I have never ruined it-- I would definitely recommend it for beginners :)

This is a great recipe! The only thing I can complain about is the rising time. It definitely takes longer than 1 hour to let the bread rise above the pan...at least 3hrs. Other than that, Simply delicious!

I tried this recipe making only one modification and the bread was so good you could eat it by itself. my grandson liked it so much he almost ate the whole loaf. very tasty and easy.the modification I made was to reduce the sugar do half a cup and added one third cup honey.

It turned out great. Instead of sugar I used honey. Also put in dried apples and cinnamon. Yummy will make it again.

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to make.  I replaced the oil with butter. Carla Hall on The Chew uses a heating pad to help the dough rise. It works! I put the pad in between a towel and kept the dough nice and cozy while it rose. Everyone loves it.  This is our new daily bread.

We screwed this up but it was still delicious. I used WAY too much yeast, helpful kids that wanted to knead dough overkneaded.... so it was like a big crackery flour-heavy brick but it tasted awesome. lol. If we did it properly, it would be awesome.

First time bread baker and this recipe made me look like a pro! I only had All Purpose flour and it worked just fine. I had to wait MUCH longer for it to rise though. Well worth the wait!!!

Loved everything about it!!! Super easy to make the dough in my bread machine. Quick steps and simple ingredients. The only change I made was to add a couple of extra tablespoons of water during the mix cycle on my bread machine if needed. DELISH results!!! My fave bread recipe ever to date! 
**I have also used this to make cinnamon rolls...and they are amazing!!!!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. This was easy to make, it rose as expected both in the bowl and in pans. I used all of the sugar and it was in the oven before I read all of the reviews that claimed it was too sweet. I made two loaves that rose nice and high they were slightly more dense than the squishy grocery store white bread but definitely not too dense. The flavor was that of white bread. I cooked them for exactly 30 minutes. It was not too sweet and just homemade tasting enough to make it worth it. My children love to eat white bread- plain and toasted and the store bought varieties have so many chemicals. This is awesome. Thank you.

Second time making bread ever, second recipe tried (first recipe had no sugar and was flavorless), and this was a total success!! I followed a recommendation in the comments to decrease sugar to 1/4c for a more normal sliced white bread flavor, and I am TOTALLY SOLD on this recipe! I couldn't ask for more from a white bread recipe. The loaves are beautiful and have such nice flavor and it was super easy and straightforward!

One of my families favorites!  As the men in my life say, "It even makes a plain peanut butter and jelly taste good!"   half the recipe and use my bread machine for the dough making.  Then bake in the oven.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Fantastic simple recipe. Made up the dough and then threw it in the bread machine to bake. It's perfect with jam or spreads, just the right density. Perfect 5 out of 5.

This is my new standard recipe for making easy yeast bread at home! It turned out delicious and was quickly devoured by the family. For those who complain of dense bread, or it being too sweet, make sure your yeast is fresh and to let it get thoroughly "started" before proceeding with the recipe. The longer you leave the yeast in the sugar-water, the less sweet and more of a sour dough taste you'll get. Also, make sure to kneed the dough enough to develop adequate gluten so it's not too dense or crumbly...

This recipe is very forgiving. I am glad I chose it as my very first bread recipe.  I have progressed to many more advanced techniques over the past year, but I find myself using this recipe or a slight variant repeatedly, especially cinnamon rolls and sandwich bread for the kids as it is sweet as written.  Of course you could reduce the sugar.

Great recipe!  I use my kitchen Aid stand mixer to make the dough using the dough hook and slowly add the last cup of flour until the dough cleans the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl.     It turns out perfect every time I make it.  I also use EVO instead of vegetable oil just for the added flavor.

I have tried this bread numerous times and it always seems too sticky. I have added up to 7 cups of flour, use a KA mixer and it's still sticky. I am afraid to add more flour and have it end up too heavy. I am gluten free and can't try it but everyone says its good. Just frustrated with the stickiness, any tips?

Just follow the recipe exactly, you will not be disappointed. I've tried it three times by now. On the last time, I've even replaced the flour with 1/3 cup of flaxseed. The final product was still satisfactory.

This is my first attempt at making yeast bread. I divided the dough, putting one half in a nine inch cake pan and the other in a loaf pan. I baked them the exact amount of time and love both of the results! The loaf turned out a little denser with a crustier top, while the artisian style loaf came out soft and tender! I'm pretty happy this turned out on my first try, as my dad has been a baker for over 60 years!His bread is over the moon~  I hope to make bread as good as him some day!~

Absolutely love this recipe I make it all the time and only a couple adjustments Ive made to the recipe over the many years I've been baking it. First before raising second time I slightly cut down the center of the loaves to make them split top then I actually let it rise a full hour the second time this makes it just perfect. Everyone loves it. I also cover the tops of the loaves towards the end with foil to reduce browning on the tops of the loaves then I brush it with melted butter after taking it from the oven. Great recipe. Thank you!

Loved it! I now make this weekly for my family. I also made some flour out of oatmeal and substituted that for 1 1/2 cups of the flour. It was beautiful! This recipe is easy and makes beautiful yummy tasting bread. The only thing I do different is I brush the top with melted butter when it's done cooking.

Ahhhhmazing and very simple to make. This recipe is easy to modify to varying tastes. I tried it several ways after making the recipe as is, and each time my family loved it. Some of the changes I tried: halved the recipe, decreased sugar, increased salt, subbed a cup of white whole wheat flour, and baked italian style (not in a loaf pan). Each different mod still made a delicious loaf.

I have been weary of white sandwich bread. And I love making bread. I've made challah, dinner rolls, pizza rolls, etc. But white sandwich bread, I just couldn't. I tried a recipe from a well-known female cooking instructor on YouTube. I tried two different version of her bread. They came out tasting incredibly yeasting. It was unpleasant. The middle always sank slightly though the bread was baked-through. It didn't cut well. It was a mess. Then behold, this recipe comes and saves the day. It's delicious, I had it right out of the oven, no yeasty taste. No dent in the middle. Perfection. I followed the recipe to a T, except I only made one loaf of bread and only put in 2 tablespoons of sugar. I plan on making a cinnamon swirl bread with this, in that case, I'll add all the sugar required. Great recipe. Did I say that already?

Wow. This was the first recipe I made with my new Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  Thank you to breadguy for the tips in his review!  This bread brought the best compliment I have ever received on something I made: my husband compared it to his grandmother's famous bread.  That brought me to tears.  *Update: When this comes out of the oven I immediately brush it with olive oil or melted butter, then cover with plastic wrap as it cools. That helps soften the crust.  I made a batch with half bread flour and half whole wheat flour, and that was declared to be the best bread yet.* *2nd Update: this works well for sweet rolls, like cinnamon or orange, and I have also used it to make a stuffed loaf (Stromboli type).  *Update 3: add garlic and Italian herbs before making into Stromboli!* Bottom line: this is a great, easy, versatile recipe.*

Best recipe by far! The recipe is amazing as is, but the second time I used butter instead of vegetable oil, and replaced quarter of the water with low fat milk and it was even better!

Amazing! I've just started making bread. After 3 attempts equaling 6 failed loaves (different recipe) I was about to give up when I ran across THIS recipe and decided to give bread making 1 last try. All through making it, I was sure it would be another dense flopped attempt fit for the trash can. NOPE! Pure light yummy goodness far better than any store bought or homemade bread I've EVER had!! My 3 kids and I stood at the counter with the loaf and the butter dish consuming far more than I feel comfortable with admitting to. I, nor my family, have any objections to me just sticking to this recipe from here on out :)

I made this bread for the second time this morning.  The first time I made it, it didn't turn out the way I had hoped, but it was my fault! First, I decreased the sugar - only used 1/3 cup; second, I used my stand mixer with the bread hook but obviously didn't knead the bread as long as I should have because I could taste the yeast.
This time I used the 2/3 cup sugar called for and kneaded the dough in the stand mixer until the dough was crawling up the bread hook.  When I took it out of the bowl, I continued to knead it by hand for a few minutes more, ensuring all the ingredients were well mixed.  The end result was two perfect loaves, that baked up perfectly in 30 minutes.  I couldn't resist the smell of the fresh baked bread and cut a couple of slices right away!  Absolutely amazing and what surprised me, is the sugar was not overpowering in the finished loaf!  Having nailed this recipe, I am not sure I'll ever use my bread machine again!

Yes, this bread is sweet, but it has a key word in the recipe:  AMISH.  Amish make the bread sweeter than regular white bread, and the sugar also lends a hand to the proofing of the yeast.  It reacts faster and becomes much thicker than regular bread recipes because the yeast feeds off of it.  I highly recommend this bread as a sweetbread, but if you're wanting to make it not so sweet, just halve the sugar in the beginning.

I love this bread! So easy to make, does not require as much rising
time as some yeast breads. Has a little sweetness to it which I like.
I did not use mixer with dough hook, I mixed mine by hand, very simple.
I plan to make this bread weekly and may give some loaves as Christmas
gifts, along with cookies and fudge.

Loved it, a sweeter bread that reminds me of my grandmothers bread. Although I would suggest watching how much flour you do put in, do it a cup at a time as I only really needed 5 cups in the dough and the last cup was sparingly used to knead the dough in. It didn't rise as much as I'd hoped as I used cooler water than I should have to activate the yeast which I would think was the problem.

This was my first attempt at making bread and it was DELICIOUS. My family couldn't get enough of it. One loaf was gone before it had time to cool. I made this following the recipe exactly. Wasn't too sweet as mentioned by some. We ate some with butter and made sandwiches with some. Great either way. Will be making this again.

I liked it because it was sweeter than other breads I have ever tried.
Though I did change the ingredients around a little.
I added 5 cups of bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time.
And I sprinkled some flour over the loaves while they were rising in the
loaf pans.
Otherwise, they were awesome!

This has become my go to recipe as my husband adores it! For those saying it's too sweet, you need to remember that this is a traditional Amish recipe. We have Hutterite family friends here in Canada and their bread is very sweet as well. This is probably why my husband always asks for this recipe so much, it reminds him of visits from friends from the colony at his grandparents farm! This has become a family favourite...thank you for sharing it!

OMGee this was unbelievably sweet! More like it should be used for sweet rolls than bread. The dough handled easily and baked into a lovely loaf which is the reason for giving it 3 stars.

Simple and very straight forward recipe for a beginning bread baker.  Great for sandwiches and toast in the morning.  If you follow the directions, you can't go wrong.  Tip: use fresh active dry yeast.

I tried to make this recipe twice; once by hand and once in the bread machine.  The vegetable oil makes a horrible aftertaste in the bread that nothing can cover up.  I was disappointed because of the great reviews.

Nice bread recipe.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour and I came out with a nice moist loaf of bread.  I also cut the sugar in half because I was going to use maple syrup in place of the sugar.  Even doing that, you could still taste a little bit of the sweetness from the syrup.  Will be making this again.

I love this bread and have made it several times.  It is a bit dense for a bread, and I always use 1/3 cup sugar so it isn't quite so sweet, but my family goes nuts for this recipe.  I have even shared this recipe with friends who have loved it!  A family friend (whose family only eats wheat bread) tried this and loved it.  Makes an excellent gift, and I hope to make it a lot more often now that I have a kitchenaid stand mixer :)

Excellent bread!  I wouldn't use it for a sandwich, but that's just my personal taste - I want something lighter and less crusty for a sandwich.  But that doesn't change my opinion on this recipe!  The bread is delicious and easy to make!

I decided to make half of this recipe cinnamon rolls and than one loaf of bread. Since it is a sweeter bread it is now my go to cinnamon roll dough. I am looking for a better white bread recipe. This was a little to dense to be fluffy white bread that everybody loves.

1/8/2013 I cut the recipe in half and combined it all in my bread machine on the dough cycle. After that first rise, I took it out and forgot to knead it lightly. I just put it straight into my loaf pan to rise again, yet it still turned out and tasted delicious! I used it to make Mom's Gourmet Grill Cheese Sandwich, and what a wonderful sandwich! This bread made grilled cheese something special! 3/13/2016 I make the full recipe using my KitchenAid Mixer. So easy. After mixing all ingredients together using the dough hook, I oil the mixing bowl and set it on a heating pad to rise. Then I punch it down, put it in 2 loaf pans, and set them on the heating pad to rise before baking.

Love this bread.  It has replaced store-bought bread for us, we have made it every week for over a year.  We use 2 cups whole wheat flour and 3 cups white bread flour.

The recipe makes 2 loaves.  If you only need one, go ahead and mix up the full recipe, then after the first rise, divide into two dough balls and freeze one.  Just wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze.  When ready to use let it thaw in the bread pan and it will rise once thawed.  Tastes just as good as fresh loaf.

I found a secret!!  Add 1 Tbsp of Whole Ground Flaxseed Meal.  OMG, It makes it softer and better than 5 stars.  I'm no health guru, and would probably frown upon reading a review like this.  Healthy most of the time means it doesn't taste as good.

I've made this recipe over 30x normally, and it comes out soft and good. But add the 1 Tablespoon of flaxseed!  Its essentially healthy fat which I have since learned makes all breads softer.

I now use 1/2 of recipe in a bread machine to make this bread.  

We eat it plain and used it for grilled cheese sandwiches /french toast.  Needless to say this recipe helps us kick up everything in our house.

I made this bread with my KitchenAid mixer and it was a breeze. After adding the flour, I mixed on speed 2 (using the dough hook) for about 3 minutes and then let it rise, punched it down, divided into two loaves and placed each loaf on a baking sheet which I sprinkled with cornmeal (the cornmeal gives the loaves a nice texture and appearance). The only reason I am giving this bread two stars is because it is VERY sweet as other reviewers noted. I will definitely make this again because the consistency is wonderful, but I will reduce the sugar by half as a starting point.

Absolutely fantastic, and so easy! The only problem is, I have to make all four of my kids a loaf when I make it!This bread freezes well, and you can also divide it into 12 rolls before the second rise, and they are just as yummy! I bake the rolls until they are just turning brown, let them cool, seal in an airtight container and freeze. When I need dinner rolls, I take them out, let them thaw, preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake 10-12 mins. Tastes just like fresh!!

(For the record, it is a sweeter bread than plain white or French bread.)  Great recipe!    This makes an awesome bread just as the recipe is.  To change it up a bit, I add two cups of whole wheat flour in place of two cups of bread four.  I made a nice, light wheat bread, I don't care for full on wheat bread.

This was my first time making bread. This in addition to just learning how to cook (at 40) things other than what fits in a microwave or is ready in under a minute on the stove. I followed the steps on this recipe and I am proudly enjoying the aroma of fresh baked bread and now the taste!!! Thanks for this easy to follow recipe.

It's great bread.  You can safely cut down the enormous amount of sugar in it if you wish unless you like it slightly sweet.

I actually made this in my bread maker.  HOWEVER, I did not follow bread machine directions.  I proofed the yeast first then added the salt and oil last flour.  I just let the machine do all the work.  I used the dough cycle.  I then divided it in half and put it in a cold over to rise again.  It is amazing

My family's favorite bread recipe.  This was the first bread recipe I tried to make by hand and even the first batch was great, unlike others I've tried since.  This will remain my go-to bread recipe.  Great with home made butter and for sandwiches.

I just finished making this, and used all purpose flour, and the only thing I can say is that this bread is FABULOUS!!!  
I can't say enough on how easy this was to make and how good it is.  Best bread I have made.

The bread was absolutely amazing best I have ever made. I read other reviews and made a couple changes myself. 1. Decrease sugar to 1/3 cup 2. Up salt to 2 tsp (note I used Morton fine cut sea salt) 3. I used a 1/4 cup margarine in place of the oil. The bread came out fluffy and perfect. It rose better than any other bread I have made, this recipe will replace my regular one thanks

Very delicious bread.  An easy dough to work with, too.  I halved the recipe and made the dough in my bread machine.  Then I shaped it into pull-apart rolls before letting it rise again.  It's very pretty, and really good.  A keeper....thanks.

I halved the recipe to make it in my bread machine. I used milk for the water, halved the sugar amount and used honey and used butter for the oil. The bread had a great crumb and crust, was devoured in minutes. Baked on sandwich setting in my bread machine.

My go to bread for sandwiches, and also roll it up to make dinner rolls. This is the bread that got me started baking...my four-year old doesn't remember what store-bought bread tastes like anymore and he loves to help me make it. I stick to it pretty religiously, although I have tried less sugar (like), and using warm milk instead of water(like for hamburger buns). This recipe totally changed our kitchen.  Thanks, Peg! I haven't bought a loaf of bread in years.

I have made this bread many times now without any issues what so ever. I live in ohio and the flour amount is perfect. This makes me about 2 bread pan sized monster loaves or one really long bread pan loaf.  I use half the amount of sugar thats called for in the recipe as my goal is sandwich bread. I also use about 2 tbs of yeast instead of 1 1/2 it gives it a slightly stronger yeast taste like you get in store bought bread. I have started using grapeseed oil instead of veg simce istaying away from gmo's. Olive oil is too heave, it makes it dense. I make this in a bread machine so i add the water, salt, sugar and oil first then the flour on top, and finally the yeast. I set it to dough which mixes and rests for about an hour and a half. Then i put it in the pan and rise again. No hand or mixer kneeding, no proofing the yeast. Its so simple! We dont buy store bread anymore. This is perfect.

This bread was the first homemade bread I ever baked. It was easy to make and turned out delicious! After reading many reviews, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup and regretted it later. This bread is meant to be sweet!  Definitely was a favorite in my family, 1 whole loaf was gone that evening. Thank you for sharing this recipe Peg!

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly except that I halfed the sugar.  I'm sure it would be good with the full amont but wanted something less sweet.  Also, used olive oil because we were out of veg oil.  We really liked the texture of this bread- not too dense.

The best white bread recipe I have tried! I follow the recipe exactly, though it can also be modified to make cinnamon raisin bread or whatever by rolling it flat and spreading it with something and rolling it up. I will be making this regularly!

I think this is the easiest bread recipe I've ever tried.  I followed the advice of others and cut sugar to 1/4c.  I also made this in my Cusiniart mixer, using the bread hook to mix up the yeast mixture and then the dough.  I put a shallow pan of hot water in the oven and covered the bowl with a damp cloth while proofing which worked great.  I punched the top down with my hands and then used the mixer to knead the dough again for another 4 minutes on the lowest speed.  Instead of making loaves, I pinched off the dough in 1.5" balls and laid them out next to each other on a cookie sheet.  I let them rise and then lightly brushed the top with beaten egg whites.  I ended up with about 48 dinner rolls although there are much less now! :) These turned out perfect and my family raved about them.

Ace recipe, this has become our staple. No more buying bread.  Thank you for sharing this!!  The success I had making this has given me the confidence to experiment with breads and plunged me headlong into an addiction for baking all kinds of things - soft pretzels, bagels, sourdough breads... you name it.  Thank you again!!

Like a lot of others the only modification I made to this recipe was to halve the sugar, and I tend to use Unbleached White Flour since that's easier for me to source... still yields amazing bread each time. I do it all by hand, no mixer, no bread machine, just me, my hands, the ingredients, and my trusty oven :) You gotta try this recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I don't really have a knack for bread per say. But this recipe was really easy to follow. I wish that bread could be like cookies or cake, because you can't just stick a tooth pick in and know when it's done. The bread is always in there longer that it says, but that's okay. I usually get antsy and pull it out early. So it was a little doughy in the middle.

This had a nice texture and good flavor. The only thing I did differently was to cut the recipe in half. I used my bread machine on the dough cycle and made one small loaf and a few rolls. I will make this again.

my husbands favorite bread recipe. Easy to make and very tasty.  I let it rise in a slightly warmed oven and it rises quickly.  It rises faster than the recipe states, so don't forget it in there!

Delicious! This is by far the best bread recipe I have found. I like to add a few eggs and 1/3 cup less sugar for non sweet variations, and that seems to make it even better and more flavorful and moist. I like it best in loaf form, I tried making rolls and it was not quite as tasty, I don't know why. Add spices and herbs like garlic powder, oregano and basil and then some parmesan cheese, or throw in some dried fruit or blueberries and nuts! Yum!

Woo Hoo! Finally a recipe I enjoy following. I am usually a non-recipe type, but I won't make bread without recalling this one. Sturdy, all purpose. I have made it with different amounts of 100% Whole WHEAT Flour, up to 2/3rds wheat 1/3 white and it still turns out wonderfully.

Delightful! 

Made a half recipe (only 1 loaf).

Used 1/4 cup warm water to dissolve yeast & set aside. Used remaining 3/4 cup warm water to dissolve sugar & salt while yeast was dissolving (approx 10 min.). Used greased pan & also added a little oil.

2nd rise took a little longer than 30 min., but rose faster when I placed it on top of my pre-heating oven- I'll do that from the beginning of the second rise next time & see if it rises faster. 

After 25 min. of baking the top was plenty brown.  May check earlier next time or reduce temp. 

Wonderfully good!!! Good substitute for sour dough bread if you don't have a sourdough starter! Highly recommend the recipe!!!  I'll definitely be making this one again!!!

This was great! I used another reviewers suggestion to use only 2 tablespoons sugar and it turned out perfectly. 

Very very simple and easy to make. I wish I would have tried this recipe for my first bread making experience.

Great simple white bread recipe to replace store bought bread.
Added a 2 teaspons of gluten to make bread a little more chewy and fluffier.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great! The whole family enjoyed it and I don't think it's going to last very long. It was easy to make though, so it won't be a problem to make more. Next time I want to put in some lecithin powder to increase the protein content, but that's just us.

I halved the recipe because I have only one loaf pan. It worked well. really well. I also reduced the sugar, as suggested by some users here, but for some reason, the bread became bland. I might add some salt next time. But this is really easy to make and I can even do it on weekdays now. No more frozen bread in my household.

This is THE perfect bread recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to use all purpose flour and add 3 Tbs of vital wheat gluten (baking section of your grocery store.). The loaves were not dense at all, just fluffy and soft goodness!  I have tried many different bread recipes trying to find the perfect everyday loaf, and this is it.  It is similar to eating a dinner roll, except it's sliced:)

I could not review this recipe as I have tried 3 different types of yeast and I am still waiting on the foam/froth! Even used the saf-instant even though it says it should be added to the flour and not the water. Was so looking forward to this, but after so many failed attempts, I think I will look for another recipe :(

I have been making this bread for a couple of months now. It comes out great every time! I make a healthier bread by using 2 cups bread flour and the rest whole wheat flour. Also I have used 2 cups bread flour, 3 1/2 cups Whole Wheat flour, add 1/4 cup of Flaxseed Meel and 1/4 cup of Wheat Germ. Even the picky eaters don't realize that this bread is healthy. This is a very easy recipe to make to adjust and make what ever you want. Less sugar for dinner rolls plain or add some Italian seasoning to the mixture shape brush with melted butter and bake. A little more sugar great for Cinnamon rolls or Cinnamon raisin bread. Thanks for posting!

Very good and easy to prepare. Like others I used 1/4 c sugar, and was delicious! I divided it and made one loaf and made bun with the other half, just like my mom in law used to make  yum yum. I also used 1 c. whole wheat flour and then only 5 cups all purpose flour and turned out wonderful..

I am a first time bread maker.  I rarely follow a recipe by the number. I did on this one and it turned out amazing.  I did use the breadguy's advise for the kitchen maid.  I have made a total of 5 loaves of bread (not 6 only because I ran out of ingredients) in 1 week.  Spectacular.  Thanks Peg.

I've been making this bread for years.  At Christmas I make it for gifts.  It is always a hit with friends.  Makes the best toast.  To me, it's a no miss recipe and a good basic recipe for rolls too.

This bread is easy, has a nice texture and yummy. My first try at this bread seemed too sweet, so I took another users suggestion of cutting the sugar by half. Although I think the original recipe would be great for a sweet dinner roll.

The best! I am an experienced baker and this is he best bread. I let it rise on a heating pad and it raised nicely. I did cut the sugar to about 1/3 cup, so I was surprised it raised so well. The bread is fluffy, "not cakey" as my 7 yr old says. Thanks!

amazing...I made this in a breadmachine, halved the recipe but with just 1/4 of sugar like someone else suggested.  I used the dough setting, let it rise in a greased pan, covered with a damp kitchen towel on the stove as the oven pre-heated for 30 min. Then baked for 30min @ 350 exactly and it came out beautifully! The best bread I've ever made, fluffy and just slightly sweet.  I will be making and eating a lot of this!

This is my go to recipe. It always turns out perfect! I put all the ingredients in my bread machine on the "dough" setting. Once done, I put it in my loaf pan, or shape into bread sticks, buns, bowls, or whatever I want.I let it let rise, then I bake it in the oven mmmmmm. Delicious every single time.

Thanks Peg for this great recipe and tips on making this bread!!!!!!! I have other Amish or white bread recipes, but none are as easy or taste as good as this one. When I put a slice of it in the toaster, it makes my whole house smell like I'm baking bread. Again, thanks Allrecipes and Peg.

I followed this EXCEPT for the kind of flour...I used all purpose and I have to say, it turned out wonderful.  It was  easy, and I will use it again and again.  I made it with my Kitchen Aide mixer and used some of the tips I found in the reviews.  Thank you so much.   ***
As an update....I still use this recipe every week, and I have taken to rolling the dough out into a rectangle shape and then rolling it into a log, trimming the ends so that it will fit into a loaf pan and it comes out perfect.  DON'T moisten it to make it "stick", put the seam side down and you will be just fine.  When I use it to make rolls, I add a touch of vanilla, use butter instead of oil and I do NOT KNEAD IT or roll it out.  I just pinch off a golf ball size piece, roll it into a ball shape and flatten it just a tiny bit, place them in a greased pan with the rolls not quite touching, let it rise for an hour and bake like you would the bread, at 350 for about 17 minutes.  If you want them to be shiny, beat an egg with a tsp of water and brush the tops before baking.  Brushing them with butter is nice, but they don't get that shine to them

My husband and kids all loved this bread despite the fact that I don't think it rose properly. That was my fault though - I'm not good with yeast. But it tasted good and it was easy. They are all waiting for me to make it again!

I have had this recipe for some time now and love love it. I don't change anything.
I have made this several times, holidays, at home, for work gathering and supper at friends. I have had rave reviews each time. I rarely make any other bread.

Fantastic, and very easy bread recipe! Turns out every time! If you want it a little less sweet, just cut down on the sugar.

I've never baked bread before but I've always wanted to. I chose this bread because it seemed like a very simple bread to start out with - and it was. I had no problems at all. I reduced the sugar like others suggested but I'm thinking I should have reduced it less, as the bread is pretty bland. 

Still better than store-bought, though, and will be great for sandwiches for the coming week!

For BREAD MACHINE users, just load in these ingredients in the same order as any recipe: water first; then flour, sugar and salt; (canola) oil in each corner; then yeast in the well in the middle.

I just halved the recipe exactly. I had misplaced my amish bread recipe and was only looking for a list of ingredients. This is a good one for when you don't have perishables like butter and milk.

This was an excellent, and easy recipe. It was the first regular bread that I've ever made. I would personally recommend using a little less sugar, like many people suggest, but everyone else who ate it at my house liked that it was a little sweeter. Just a matter of preference.

Excellent recipe and so easy to make!  I had never made bread before and decided to try it.  On the suggestion of a friend for a good white bread, I used 2 Tbsp. of sugar instead of what the recipe called for.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook to mix it all together.  I wasn't sure what the yeast was supposed to look like but went on the article on AR to see for sure (it was completely obvious when it started proofing).  I ended up baking mine a little longer in my silicone bakeware (turned out beautiful) because I did one loaf, 12 dinner rolls and a "pretzel" out of what little dough was left.  I would like to have a taller loaf next time so I might use the entire loaf in one pan.  I let it "rise" for the suggested 30 minutes after I put it in the loaf pan but it didn't grow in size a whole lot.  Other than that, it was such an easy recipe to follow and a great one if you've never made bread.  Thanks for sharing!

This bread is great. Very easy to make and has a great flavor. It is dense and a little more sweet than store bought bread, but this is not a negative.

I add 4 tablespoons of cold milled flax.  Its adds a really nice nutty flavor and makes the bread more moist.  I also make this recipe by hand.  It takes little time and does not mess up the mixer.   I have been making this for a few years now, so I have the process down and memorized. It takes me about 20 minutes to prep it and get it in the bowl to rise (that includes the 10 minutes to wait for the yeast to proof) and about 2.5 - three hours total (that includes all the waiting time).  Its important to know total time as you proabably want to be home during that time.  Its also important you get the water temp correct.... for me its exactly 1 minute in the microwave. I use this bread each week for my kids and husband's lunches, for toast and even for Thanksgiving stuffing this year.  My guests LOVED the stuffing and complimented it not knowing the bread in it was homemade.  I also buy my ingredients in bulk at costco, so the cost of this bread is really cheap!

I've been looking for a white bread recipe for awhile. I have tried about 5 different recipes, all with great reviews. This one definetly is to my taste. I did as some reviewers suggested and cut back on the sugar and it was great. I halved the recipe and made this in my bread machine.

This is phenominal.  I made my first loaf of white bread Sunday using another recipe and it was okay.  I made my second and third loaves of bread yesterday (whole wheat) and they were okay too.  I made this recipe today (using my Bosch stand mixer) and it is so delicious - we ate half of one loaf already.  If you have not made this yet, you must! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is by far my family's favorite bread of all time. They get so excited when I make it. It's soooooo good I usually make a batch and freeze some to keep on hand at all times. It's so easy to make and is truly has the best taste and texture.

I am thrilled with the success I had with this bread!  I followed the directions given with the exception of using only two tablespoons of sugar.  I also used my Kitchen Aid as I cannot knead bread for more than a couple of minutes due to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The bread came out perfectly and I know that I'll be making this bread on an ongoing basis.  Thank you Peg!

This bread is delicious! Very easy to make, simple ingredients. I never want to buy store bought bread again! Thank you! As a note, to cut down on sugar I do slightly less than 2/3 cup instead of the full amount and it still turns out great.

Ladies and Gentleman, I (a cook with a looooong history of bread baking failures and phobias) have finally and successfully made BREAD! Seriously...i wish I could hug the person that posted this recipe. Why this came out so delicious when EVERY time I've tried to make bread in the past it's turned into a disaster? I will never know. I'll contemplate it while I snack on this perfectly moist, semi sweet, still warm, buttered slice of heaven ;)

WOW!! This is just as good or better than I've read!!! I made it yesterday to take to a dinner and it was perfect!  I used bread flour and lowered sugar to 1/3 cup. Great texture, taste,look, high rise, good dough to work with. Sliced perfectly.  I had rave reviews and 9 of us ate almost 2 loaves!

This is fantastically delicious. I cut the recipe in half because I only have one bread pan. Except for that I didn't have any bread flour and had to use All Purpose, I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. I didn't measure the sugar precisely and I may have only used 1/4 cup for a half recipe. I allowed it to rise 1 hour, punched it down, kneaded into a loaf shape and let rise in the loaf pan another hour. Baked 25 minutes @ 350. PERFECT! It rose very well. I haven't let it cool yet, and just cut the end off so I could taste it right away (because I'm starving :) I'm going to let the rest of it cool and see how well it makes sandwiches. I may just use this recipe for white sandwich bread from now on if it works out OK. I would also like to try it as a wheat version....hmmm and the cinnamon raisin version others suggested sounds delicious!!!

I made mine with apple sauce instead of oil and it was amazing!!!  Just a hint of sweetness and a lot less crumbs.  Actually usable as sandwich bread with the apple sauce, and healthier too.  :)

This bread did taste good but I don't think it exactly lived up to the expectations I had from the reviews. But the best part was I had never made bread before and this was easy and quick to make and I had no trouble and now I want to make more different kinds of bread recipes, this is perfect for a first time bread baker.

Very fluffy bread just wanted to comment that it works well also when I did 40/60 whole wheat flour/all purpose. Turned out great. About to make it again. thanks for the easy recipe without milk or eggs which i currently don't have :)

Soft, fluffy, sweet and perfect height.

When making bread, the amount of flour is always a suggestion.  In my case, I used just over 5 1/2 cups but once I got to 5 cups I added flour by the tablespoon; so to avoid adding too much flour (which would result in a denser loaf)-- I do not have a mixer so this was all done by hand.

Based on the amount of sugar listed in the ingredients list, this bread would obviously be on the sweeter side.

I just had the first piece and it was indeed a sweeter loaf, but expecting that, my husband and I devoured our butter slathered pieces harmoniously!  

Also, for a yeast bread, this certainly doesn't take much time to whip up! 

I would absolutely make this again!

While it wasn't the most beautiful-shaped loaf of bread I've ever made, the taste and texture knocked this one out of the park! I knew it would be good, as it's very similiar to another recipe I just tried for wheat bread... this is light and fluffy and tender and...sweet. I didn't pay attention to the sweetness until my boyfriend pointed it out. And that's after reducing the sugar! (I halved this, and used about 3T??). Can't wait to make it again! BF said I better not lose this one!

I bet I've made this 50 times now. It is delicious. I live in a very dry climate. To make my bread rise, I heat a glass of water for 3 minutes in the microwave. I close the bread dough in the microwave with the steamy water. (microwave is not on) The recipe itself is flawless.

Absolutely heavenly. It has a sweet flavor and is so soft and fluffy. I love this bread! This recipe made one loaf and about 12 rolls for me. I used regular all purpose flour. Once they came out of the oven we HAD to eat them. We used the rolls to make mini meatball subs! Great recipe! Very easy too!

A little sweet. I could see this sweet bread being perfect for french toast. However, for everyday bread, I would halve the sugar.

I cut the recipe in half (12 servings) and made it in my bread machine. It came out great. It rose very nicely, the texture was perfect, and it had a good, slightly-sweet taste. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Made as recipe stated, the bread is a bit sweet for my taste (why it got 4 out of 5 stars).  I then tried halving the sugar like another reviewer suggested and now I have a white bread that BEATS any I have tasted in the supermarket!  Tastes great and wonderful texture too!  Also if you're out of bread flour, just use all-purpose flour.  You will still get a great loaf of bread!  I used my KitchenAid mixer to kneed the dough.  About 5min of kneeding after the dough comes together then into well oiled bowl for the 1st rise.

I'm still a novice bread maker, but this recipe has never failed me.  Absolutely scrumptious--I use only 1 Tbs of Splenda and let it proof for about five minutes.

I added some milk in mine, and kneaded it 500 times, or a good 20 minutes. This turned out the best bread ever! I could have taken pictures of this one, and you would have thought a Food Network Star made it. I learned about kneading from Sara Phillips and employed a longer knead. Perfect! I made four loaves, total, and they all are excellent and superb!

This is so easy, even my husband can do it!  I have a different recipe for Amish bread that's a thicker, crustier version.  This recipe makes really light and fluffy bread which is great for picky eaters.

Yeah, this is delicious!  If you're looking for sandwich bread like I was, this is not it (it's a little too "spongey" to slice and toast), but it makes a killer bread to go with a meal.  I think I'll try dinner rolls with it, as many suggested.

This is my second attempt at baking bread...the first time was about 20 years ago and suffice to say it was such a disaster that I have not attempted to try again until I saw this recipe and all the great reviews. It was easy and turned out perfect! I took the suggestion about reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup and I think this is good. I would probably increase it to 2/3 if making a sweet bread such as cinnamon rolls. I won't need to look for another recipe, this is perfect. I thought some readers might like to know that I split the dough into thirds and put them in well oiled aluminum loaf pans from the dollar store. I think I should be able to use them several times. I live alone and am diabetic so I don't need a large loaf. Baking time was the same, 30 minutes.

I gave it 5 stars, but I only used 1/4 cup sugar otherwise it would have been too sweet.  The dough rose nicely and the loaves baked up perfectly!  Everyone loved it!

A good basic recipe.  Too plain to eat by itself but it makes divine cinnamon bread or rolls.  Roll out the dough, spread soft butter with your fingers (optional), sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon and maybe raisins.  Make two loaves or cut up into 1" pieces for cinnmon rolls.

A great bread, although it's a little too sweet as written - I reduce the sugar to 1/2 - 1/3 cup when I bake it, put an egg wash on top, and it comes out very fluffy and flavorful. 

It makes pretty round loaves with a little sesame seed sprinkled on top of the egg wash, and I'm trying it as cinnamon bread right now! This is a good, versatile recipe and my new go-to bread.

Delicious recipe!  I followed BreadGuy's top-rated comment as I have a KitchenAid stand mixer, and used 3 TBSP of organic sugar rather than the 2/3 cup.   This is the most successful bread I've made yet, in terms of the initial rise and how large the loaf got while in the oven!   These loaves are nice and tall, and a good size for sandwich bread (others I have made haven't risen as high, and end up puny in comparison to the lunchmeat!)  I weighed my ingredients, and everything came out perfect at exactly 30 minutes.   Thanks!

This one is definitely a winner and my husband who used to only love the store-bought Hawaiian rolls has found a new fave. I do often cheat and do the first rise in the bread machine, but I always bake it in the oven after rising once more in the loaf pan. Thanks for sharing! P.S. We love it with the amount of sugar directed. It's not too sweet, but it does well with less sugar for a more normal "roll" flavor with certain dishes.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. My family thinks it's great. It is indeed a foolproof recipe. I use a stand mixer with a dough hook to do the kneading and this saves me a bunch of time.

The best loaf bread recipe I have ever tried!  Soft and moist.  Perfect. So quick and easy to make even my teenagers can do it. From start to finish this is made in my KitchenAid to make it not only easier to knead but cleaner to make. During the rise stage just pour the oil over the dough and turn to coat.  No counter mess :o)

This bread is amazing! I have made it twice now, the first time with less sugar because of many of the other reviews, and the second with the called for amount of sugar.  The original recipe is perfect the way it is and I don't think I can ever go back to store bought bread again.

The recipe as is, no adjustments, is delicious. I was looking for a sweet white bread for Easter dinner and this is perfect. I used a bread machine, adding the yeast and 2 tbsp. of sugar to the pan with the warm water and oil first. Then I added the flour, rest of the sugar, and salt and used the dough cycle. Once done, I removed the dough from the bread machine, kneaded, divided it into two, shaped into loaves, placed in greased 9 x 5 loaf pans and let it rise in a warm spot for 1/2 - 3/4 hour before baking off. Kids loved it!

Really good bread. When I make this I have to make 2 loaves, 1 for us and the other for my in-laws. This one is a keeper!

Very simple and delicious. 
I recommend dividing this recipe and most bread recipes in half if you are not experienced. It will save you flour if you mess up. I do that since I am still learning. Good luck.

Wow, this turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly.  Fresh bread without a bread maker.  Pretty easy to make too.  I got my son to help me knead the dough.  He thinks it's fun.  Before this recipe, I was going to buy a bread maker(and really no room for one).  Now, I don't need to anymore!

OMG...this is the best bread! I made it exactly as written. Since I haven't made bread in years I would consider myself a novice. A couple of pointers at least for myself is that I had the water heated to 110F but once I poured it in the "cold" bowl it dropped 20 degrees so I put the sugar and water in the microwave and heated to 115 after adding the water/sugar back to the bowl it was perfect. Other point, my house is cool after waiting for the dough to rise on the kitchen counter for 45 minutes it did not rise at all. I put it in front of my heater and it rose perfectly in about 30 minutes. I am sure there are other ways..perhaps a warm oven that would work great.  I do not think this bread it too sweet with the recommended sugar.

This is one of the recipes I have used for my daughters IBS.  It helps her to not feel so overwhelmed with things she can't eat.  It is sweet enough that she can eat it as a treat, or put chicken and hummus on it for a sandwich.  Excellent recipe

The bread came out great, but  being at a higher altitude, (5,000ft) I reduced the yeast to 1TBS.  The bread came out light and fluffy.

This is a really good bread. I made it the first time with the full amount of sugar and it was a bit sweet. Not bad, but a little sweeter than I like my bread. I also used regular all purpose flour and it came out just fine. I just made it again, scaled back on the sugar by half. I think I'll like it better but time will tell.  This is a good all around bread, makes delicious sandwiches and of course excellent just slicing, buttering and eating with dinner.

A little sweet for my taste but great texture.  Tried second time with 1/2 sugar, was better but still a littler sweeter than I prefer.  Like the texture so much I'm going to try again with even less sugar and see how it goes.  If I can get the sugar level right, this will be my usual bread.

I am a busy college student and mother, so I am not able to bake as often as I'd like to.  However, with this recipe, I am able to make homemade bread often!  This recipe is quick and easy, and the end result is delicious!  I think the amount of sugar is perfect; I did not think it was too sweet. Try this bread toasted and buttered!  Yum!

Love this recipe! So much easier than the one I've been using and it tastes great. The texture is just the way I like it...dense but soft. I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup so it wouldn't be too sweet and I'm glad I did. Would probably use the full 2/3 cup, though if I made rolls out of it.

An excellent recipe for a sweet bread. Reduce the sugar if you don't want it sweet - but it's really good as written. I sometimes can't get it to resemble a creamy foam after the first proof but that's probably my fault. I like the sugar - my roommate puts in a whole cup! Thanks for the recipe, I luuurve it.

This is my go to bread recipe.  It taste good.  So far this bread is a little dense.  But I've also substituted butter for the oil and a cup of wheat for white flour. I am still working with this recipe and expect that I will have a light fluffy bread when I get breadmaking down.

I really liked this bread and with a little tweaking it will be a great recipie for me. I found it to be too sweet, next time I will reduce the sugar by half and replace it with something to keep the texture right where it is, applesauce maybe? That may still keep it too sweet but I will give it a try to see. Other than that this bread had one of the best textures I have found and was very tasty.

I make this once, and sometimes twice a week.  I half the recipe and put it in the bread machine, using 1.5 lb white bread, light crust setting.  The sweetness is what makes it SO good!

Delicious! My 11 year old daughter makes this herself and it turns out perfectly every time! It is definitely worth the time! We brush it with melted salted butter after we turn it out of the pans for an extra shine. Amazing alone or with butter spread over it! Tastes sweet, so we cut back the sugar by half. We like it better that way. Overall, we love it!!!

If I wanted to make these into mini raisin buns, when would I mix in the raisins? Also, would using all purpose flour affect the recipe? Thanks in advance.

This was my first bread baking experience & it was awesome! Very easy and straightforward, a great starting point for making your own bread recipes. I have used this in combination with a coffee cake streusel topping to make “cinnamon swirl” bread. But by far my favorite is a Whole Grain variant with a quarter cup of honey and maple syrup. Topped with pecans, oats and, you guessed it, more maple syrup. Truly amazed my friends and impressed their parents; its kindof a “healthy” alternative to a doughnut and goes great with your morning coffee.

A very great, versatile recipe. I used half of the dough for cinnamon rolls and it was great because the recipe calls for quite a bit of sugar. For the loaf of bread, I would use less sugar. It turned out a little sweet, but was great with butter or toasted as a side to oatmeal or used in a way for breakfast.

I make this bread all the time! The trick is to be patient when waiting for the yeast to proof. Don't rush it! The foamier it gets the more light and airy the bread. If you do you will get a denser bread.

This is the best I've found.  I do cut down on the sugar.  But it raises beautifully and is absolutely delicious

So yummy! I used my Mixer with the dough hook and it turned out great. I kneaded it a few times after I took the dough off the hook. I'm saving the other loaf dough and making another loaf later so hopefully it will turn out just as good!

This bread is awesome!  I had a bread recipe that had to rise overnight which isn't always practical.  I wanted to try this one because it seemed quick but I was skeptical.  I took the other reviewers advice and reduced the sugar to / cup and it was perfect!.  I brushed the top of mine with melted butter to give it that golden brown look.  I will definately be making this again!

This recipe is so easy!! This is the recipe I used for my very first bread making experience (2 days ago)  Bread recipe is easy to follow.  I substituted instant yeast so no proofing was necessary.  prepared otherwise according to the directions and was rewarded with an absolutely delicious bread.  In fact, I am making it again tonight!  You have to try it, you will love it.

Since I was little I had always wanted to try to make bread, but my grandma always told me it was too hard.  Not so with this recipe.  I make loaves of this to go with potato soup and also just as gifts.  The first time I made this for a family friend, half of a loaf was gone within 5 minutes of me slicing it!  I sent the other loaf home with them and they used it with their dinner.  What amazed me about it is that they only eat whole wheat bread but they loved this recipe.  I did change one thing and that is I halved the amount of sugar so that the bread wasn't too sweet.  This is now my uncle's favorite food that I make (the first time he had it, he ate nearly the entire loaf in a night!  He said it was so good he couldn't stop).  This is such a good recipe!!

This bread is awesome.  It's easy to make, doesn't require a bread machine (or even a mixer!) and has turned out great every time I have made it.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the bread does have a slight sweetness to it, which is really yummy.  As an aside, I did have to sub in olive oil last time I made it, as I didn't realize I was out of vegetable oil until I had already started.  It turned out just fine, though, and you couldn't tell any difference in the taste.

This is a good basic recipe on which to learn how to make bread without a machine. If you follow the directions and cut the sugar by half you'll come out with a very nice, if a bit dense, white bread.

This bread is incredible!!! My little sister now wants her own loaf for her birthday... so she can have the whole loaf to herself :D For excellent sandwich material, instead of all sugar, use 1/4 honey and 1/4 sugar omitting the other half of the sugar. To make bread for french toast, use the total amount of sugar that the recipe calls for, but split it with honey. It's stunning that bread can taste so good! Thank you so much for this recipe, I am not ever trying to make another white bread for sandwiches ever again!

I am not much of a "yeast" person.  Those recipes usually do not work well for me w/out my bread machine.  I gave this a try.  It worked!!!!!  Great bread, my family really enjoyed it.  I have made this 4 times in 2 weeks.

Great recipe, I've used this one several times. I've since used this basic recipe. I use only 1/4 cup of sugar and about 4 table spoons of honey, it adds a bit different of flavor as well as speeds up proofing the yeast. Then I sprinkle a bit of oats in the loaf pans. About half way through the baking I lightly brush homemade whipped honey butter on the top crust and sprinkle on some oats. And tadaa honey oat bread.  All in all a great recipe for beginners and leaves room for experimentation which for a cook is always a good thing.

My entire family loves this bread.  I make rolls instead of loaves and my sons (6,4,2) run over as soon as they come out the oven so they can eat them warm with butter.  Getting ready to make a double batch today.

I am giving this bread 5 stars.  I have a few pointers though.    First, make sure you let the yeast proof, at least 10 mins, but I wait 15. )  and Next,if you have to knead the dough by hand,  make sure you kneed the dough until completely smooth. (yes your arms will get tired, but I find that the less you kneed the dough, the more air pockets you have when its done. ) And I personally hate air pockets inside my bread.

I gave it 5 stars because it was quite good as is and was very easy to make.  I'm keeping the recipe in my file.  This bread is sweet and very dense, but has a good taste to it.  I would imagine it would make good sandwich bread, but my kids gobbled it up so fast I didn't have any to try out!

I only cut the sugar down slightly (maybe used 1/2 c) per others' suggestions and I thought it was perfect.  Per breadguy, I did weigh the flour which changed the volume measurements a bit and used his kitchenaid directions.  Will definitely make again (we ate on loaf in 24 hours)

Used all the ingredients as the recipe calls. However I did use my bread machine. I added ingerdients as machine directed and put the settings on dough. I then placed in pan and let rise for 30 minutes then baked as stated in recipe. My house smells so good and the bread tasted great with butter. My son raved how great it was with peanut butter.. Thank you for the recipe. I will be making this again..

Deserves 10+ stars.  This is probably the EASIEST bread recipe I've ever made.  I usually buy Amish bread at the farmer's market for $3.50 a loaf.  This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.......and I can make it completely organic for about a $1/loaf.  Makes perfect sandwich bread as well as dinner rolls.  I made thise EXACTLY as written.  Needs no modifacations!!!  YUM!!!!!!

Wow, am I glad I found this. I was looking for a bread recipe that wasn't designed for a breadmaker, which so many on this site are. I gave mine away a few years ago, because I was never happy with the results. Had some trouble with proofing the yeast, which wasn't the fault of this recipe, just bad yeast from the supermarket (even though used well before the expiration date). After finally getting a nice foamy head on the water/yeast/sugar mixture, the rest was a breeze. I always thought you had to use milk, because my mother always did, but this turned out better. For my white bread loaves, I did cut down sugar to 1/2 cup, which still produced a very slightly sweet nice flavor. I used the recommended 2/3 cup sugar for some cinnamon swirl bread and it was just perfect. I'm going to make cinnamon rolls for a brunch next weekend and will go with the recipe as written aslo. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This is a really good basic white bread recipe. My kids like it even better for their sandwiches and breakfasts.

Update: We no longer buy sliced bread. This bread is so simple my kids can make it.

I only gave it four stars I thought it was hard to make but then I have never made bread before.  It took me 3x then I finally got it right.  I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for at least another 30 minutes.  But once I did get it right it really was delish and my husband loved it!  So it got 4 stars instead of 3.  I will try this again it should be easy now that I know what to do.  :)

I accidentally rated the Amish Bread recipe, meaning to rate this one. I started on a quest to bake our own bread (family of 6) several months ago, and after trying numerous recipes, this one wins Hands Down. Only thing I don't add is any sugar....no need for it if you don't like sweet bread.  This recipe comes out perfectly each time. I even cut the recipe in half and no problems. I also don't cover the bread when it's rising. If you coat your bowl lightly in oil, then put your dough in and twirl a few times, it's coated and won't dry out. It's usually oily enough on top even when I put in the bread pan to rise the 2nd time...I mention in case any of you have issues with bread deflating when you take the cloth (or oiled cling film) off after rising.  When I make the double loaves, I bake one, and freeze the other BEFORE baking it. Just pop 1/2 of the dough in the bread pan just after you knead it (not after it rises first time), wrap in cling film, freeze. To bake, pop in warm spot and let defrost/rise over several hours (about 3), then bake. PERFECT loaf.  If you have any problems at all with this recipe, check the flour you're using. Strong Bread Flour is only one that works for me. Oh, and I also use extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. We always bought our bread from the local baker who makes excellent bread, but my husband now prefers mine saying it has more flavour (nice baker bread tastes like paper, and we don't go near the grocery store bagged bread!)

I've made many loaves, and lots of buns...and this recipe comes out great everytime.  I am NOT an experienced baker, but this is very easy and always a big hit with my family and friends.  Outstanding.

I have tried bread recipe after bread recipe, and they have all ended up coming out like rocks.  This recipe is divine.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup as suggested by others and found the bread to be perfectly sweet. As this recipe makes two loaves, I made one with no alterations other than the sugar and the other I added dried cranberries and flax seed meal. Yummy...the bread came out fluffy and  sweet. Can not wait to make sandwiches with it. This is a keeper

LOVE IT!!! It's the first white bread recipe that I have made that I liked. The instructions don't say how long to knead so I did for 10 minutes and it came out fantastic! My husband even liked it so much, he put up a post on FaceBook about how great it was!

I think it's a good recipe for a first time bread baker. It's nice right from the oven with butter. It can be a bit sweet though.

LOVE this bread. I have tried bread before unsuccessfully even in a bread machine, BUT this recipe is fool proof. I didn't have to add quite as much flour bc it was elastic and smooth with 4.5 cups. I pulled some out and made dinner rolls and still had enough left over for two loaves. HOWEVER, I did drop the sugar down to 1/4 C. And accidentally let it rise the first time about 2 hours. I also used an egg-wash before baking to get that beautiful golden color on top. Still with these differences, the bread baked up fine and is pretty much gone as soon as it came out of the oven.

My quest for the perfect homemade white bread is over at long last!!  Made this for the first time today and WOW!  Super easy and oh so good!  I like my bread on the light and fluffy side and have had a hard time finding THE recipe.  Well, search no mor, this is it!  The only change I made was to follow many others suggestion about cutting the sugar down.  I reduced it to 1/4 cup, but left the rest of the recipe the same.  I baked it for about 7 extra minutes and put foil on the top for the last 10 minutes so it didn't get too dark.  Came out perfectly!

I made this bread using the dough cycle of my bread machines, then made as directed (I did cut the sugar down to about half - didn't measure just didn't put in as much as called for) I have been making bread for many years.  I have two bread machines and strickly use them for the dough cycles.  I use them weekly for my family of 5.  Because I make so much bread, I use and try a lot of different recipes.  This is one of my favorites for white bread.  Definitely a keeper!

OMG, this even worked for me! I usually mix the dough in my machine and then bake it in the over because I never do it right. But this worked like a charm -- Thank you!  I used my KitchenAid with hook to knead -- about 3 minutes on 1-2.

Excellent bread!! This is now my official bread recipe. I made rolls/buns instead of loaves but next time I will try loaves too. The only changes I made were that I used regular all purpose flour and used only 2 Tbsp sugar. Wow really good bread!

Wow!  So easy to make!  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and dough hook and I also used Rapidrise yeast which did speed up the process.  I took the advice of other reviews and used only 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also added some thyme and small amount of monced garlic.  Yummy!  Thanks for this recipe!

I lost my recipe for white rolls when going to my mom's for Christmas Dinner.   I used this recipe but made it into rolls and baked in muffin tins.  Most excellent recipe they turned out even better than my old recipe.  I will be using this from now on.   This recipe rocks!

I figured more than 1,600 reviews couldnt be wrong. I found a recipe online yesterday that had such explicit directions I thought I couldnt go wrong....WRONG! I ended up with a couple small bricks. Disappointed but not discouraged, I found this recipe......easy and not complicated. So this morning (Thanksgiving) I gave this a try. And I am SOOO pleased! Perfect loaves. We will have  fresh, homemade bread for our feast afterall. Thank you for this GREAT recipe!

Have made the bread twice in a week now!  Very good. Followed the recipe - no additions/changes.  My only problem is sometimes getting the dough shaped into a nice loaf. Oh, BTW, used my Kitchen Aid...couldn't be easier!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this bread super quickly on a Saturday morning while doing household chores and sewing. It came together SO easily, I was impressed.  The taste was amazing. I had substituted AP flour for the bread flour and it was a little cake-like in texture, it also didn't rise as high as I would have liked, but an easily adaptable recipe.

my family loved this bread and it was simple to make.  I did use less sugar per another posters recommendation because I wanted more of a sandwich bread than a sweet bread.

I've been making bread with my mom since I was little and this bread is replacing hers...(shhhhh, don't tell her).  This recipe gave me two large dense loaves with soft crusts that sliced like a dream and are great with meat and cheese.  I have doubled the recipe with no trouble, rolled cinnamon/sugar into it for cinnamon bread, made cinnamon rolls and sticky buns with it and made picture perfect dinner rolls.  Wow, this recipe is very versatile and simple.  I've decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup for one batch and didn't really care for it- I guess I like my sugar.  I also used all purpose flour with no problem.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  If you are having trouble, do a little research into breadmaking in general, so you don't mess up the steps - like running the water over your wrist to make sure it's not too hot (it should be warm, but not burning hot).      Other than that, this recipe is pretty foolproof and will give you bread to rave over.

Lovely bread with simple ingredients.  I made mine in both loaves and braids, both worked well.  Used egg wash on top prior to baking.

This recipe is very good.  As with others I cut the sugar down to 2Tbsp, which was lots.  I used some whole wheat flour and added some multi grain.

9/16/09  This bread is sooo delicious!  I made it exact to the recipe, although I did brush some egg wash over the top (1 egg mixed with 2T water) prior to baking which made a nice shiny crust.  It was sweeter than white bread, but still very good.  Next time I might experiment with the sugar just for fun, and possibly substitute some wheat flour or even try all-purpose flour.  For the 2nd rise I let it rise 45 minutes.  I don't know why some reviewers say this bread is dense because I did not think so at all.  Maybe they usually eat Wonder bread or something.  This is the first bread in years that I've made start to finish totally by hand - I usually use my bread machine, if not for the whole recipe then at least through the first rise.  This recipe is SO easy.  Thank you!  It's definitely going into my collection for our enjoyment for many years to come! - - - - -

11/11/09  I tried this again today with only 1/3 cup sugar and it was a bit less sweet, but just as yummy!  I love it both ways.  It's delicious made as a sandwich with ham and honey mustard.  Next time I'm going to try making it into cinnamon bread. :)

I never proof the yeast unless I suspect it might be too old, + I keep yeast in the fridge.  The bread is very easy to make, is very light but easy to cut and doesn't crumble, so it makes good sandwich bread and toast.  I used Robin Hood Flour from Canada (which is very fine, like silk compared to regular flour which is velvety).  It raised so well my husband said it looked like it had a parachute open.  Very good bread, I will make it a lot.

I have been making this bread for a couple of years now. It was the first bread I ever tried to make. I love it! My family loves it! It is so easy and quick. About 3 hours start to finish. It's something you can make in between other tasks. I have used this recipe to make cinnamon sugar bread also; just roll out the dough nice and thin and spread a couple tablespoons of milk over the dough. Then top with a rediculously thick layer of cinnamon sugar, roll up, tuck ends under and bake as directed. If you are looking for a bread to be your first, this is it. Thanks Peg!! We LOVE it!!

Excellent and easy recipe!!  Always comes out perfect!  I use only 1/4 cup sugar, and substitute 2 cups whole wheat flour.  Be prepared to make this often- your family will stop eating store-bought bread!!  If you've never made bread before, you'll be amazed at how much more flavor you'll get than the store-bought stuff!!

Great recipe! As earlier stated, I found less sugar makes a lighter, fluffier bread, just with less flavor. Personally I prefer the denser version that remains faithful to the recipe, but the reduced sugar version (I 1/2'd the sugar, seemed to work well) is good as well. The less dense however, the more it seems to taste just like store bought wonder-bread. This is the first recipe I used to start baking and it's wonderfully easy and rewarding

Really great recipe both in taste and ease to make. Wasn't sure about what to do about the sugar because of other reviewers recommending less sugar. I went with 1/3 cup. After tasting I might go ahead and try recipe as written just to compare.

This bread recipe works. I've used all-purpose flour and bread flour, and they both work just fine. It is a little sweet, so if that's not what you're looking for, just reduce the sugar (I've made it with as little as a TBSP with no problems).

I have been using this recipe for months and it AWESOME! It is beautiful, cuts easily, strong enough for peanut butter, but soft as any store bought bread. I love it! And it's versatile. If you take it (after beating it down after first rise) and roll it out add some cinnamon and sugar and raisins, roll it up, let it rise...cook for maybe 5 extra minutes....makes a wonderful cinnamon raisin bread!

I followed the recipe but for 2 small changes, I used olive oil instead of vegetable, because that is what I had and I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  It baked up into nice soft white bread, but it also made the most delicious hot dog and hamburger rolls!  This is the way I will use this recipe from now on!

This is wonderful!  It makes the house smell sooo darn good! Also, it is not too sweet, nor cakey. It makes wonderful sandwiches and is awesome with homemade chicken soup! I currently have my 2nd batch in a week rising on my stove!  I even plan on sharing it with my neighbors.  I do substitute olive oil for traditional fats...otherwise this recipe is foolproof!

Being rebellious and contrary, I mixed the dry ingredients together and heated the wet stuff to 125 degrees, then mixed and kneaded.  Result: perfect bread.  If you like your bread on the sweet side, this is for you.

So Good. Its a little sweet, but not to much. It was the first bread I've ever made, and it turned out perfect. Just a few notes though. You want your water to be between 86 and 99 degrees F. You dont want it to be to hot or you'll kill the yeast. I let mine proof about 15 minutes, give or take. Then I do like other ppl say, and mix it in my mixer, on low, adding 1/2 cup of flour at a time. you have to use bread flour. There is a difference. After its pretty well mixed, I mix it medium for 5 minutes, take it out, make it into a ball, drizzle with oil and let rise for an hour, punch it down, and let it rise again. If the room isnt extremely hot, I usually have to let it rise for 1 1/2 hours.

This is a really good recipe due to its taste.  I substituted veg oil with corn oil and used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.  The bread still came out succssfully and I am really glad I decided to try out this recipe.  I've made bread before and a really helpful tip is to proof the yeast before any other steps.  Proof the yeast by combining the active dry yeast with the warm water and sugar ingredients, let it rest for about 10 min.  By then, the yeast mixture should have double in volume/size.  This is another way to insure that your yeast has been "activated".

Perfect for a first-timer! I've used breadmakers, but this was the first recipe I've ever done by hand, and it worked perfectly. Flavor is soft and mild with a touch of sweetness, and the scent of funnel cakes from the State Fair. Instructions were easy to follow, everything took exactly the time stated and loaves rose perfectly. I substituted approx 1/2 cup whole wheat flour since I didn't have 6 cups of bread flour. Slices well when cool for sandwiches (try slices of the "High-Temperature Eye of Round Roast" with dijon mustard and greens).

OMG I'm so proud of myself for making bread. Who woulda thought it could be so easy? Who woulda thought that I could do it without a bread machine. The loaf was nice and fluffy and white. I was worried cause the top of the loaf was hard, but that softened up with some butter. I scaled the recipe down to 1/4 size and made it an individual mini sized loaf...so cute!

This was very easy to make, but I thought it would be too sweet for bread, so I made it into dinner rolls. That turned out great, my family loved them.

Until this recipe I have been unsuccesful at making bread.  This recipe is great - easy to follow, it does just what it is meant to do at all steps, and it tastes great.  I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons as suggested by another reviewer.  We are travelling on our sailing boat at present and it is often hard to get good bread in different countries.  Now I am very pleased that I can make as much great bread as we need :-)

Good. I used all purpose flour. This was my first bread ever, and the flavor is great. My problem was the bread kept breaking apart. Weird bc it is moist, but still good with lots of butter!

It is on the sweet side. Great for toast and things like ham sandwiches. For a more normal bread appropriate for say, garlic bread, use half the sugar

I am eating this bread as we speak and it is delish! My husband and I are homemade bread fanatics. I didn't cut back on the sugar I like sweet stuff. It is sweeter than most white breads. I do believe that I am going to use this recipe for cinnamon rolls like one reviewer said I think it will turn out very good. The only thing I did different was mine was ready to come out of the oven after 20 mins. After, I took it out of the oven I always take it out of the pans and put it on a cookie rack and spread butter all over it. I think it helps from becoming hard. And it took alittle longer than 30 mins for mine to rise, I probably let mine rise for an hour or alittle more. I will be making this over and over again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Absolutely amazing bread! Wow! All my friends were raging over it! It was light and just perfect. I substituted 2C of white flour for 1C of wheat flour. I ended up using a little extra white flour, but it was great. A nice, easy, healthy recipe. I made it into rolls and also into small loaves for sandwiches. Perfect!

This was my first time making bread and I don't come from a baking family.  My dough didnt rise and multiply as much as the recipe and others said...so I was worried.  But it turned out great anyway.  It is sweet if you use all of the sugar, but still tastes fabulous.  I will cut the sugar if I try to acheive a different taste.

This is THE recipe for a beginner. Just doesn't fail and gives a very good result every time. Nothing can boost a beginner's confidence more.  Try adding 2-3 tablespoons of non-fat dry milk powder for every 3 cups of flour (mixed with the dry flour). This gives a very soft bread and crust. Worked wonerfully well for me.

Absolutely lovely & delicious bread. Truly one of the only homemade breads you can count on for everything from toast to sandwiches. (Yes, sandwiches! Anyone who's baked homemade bread knows that they don't always make the best sandwich bread.) I didn't change a thing about this recipe, and particularly enjoy how well it toasts, due to the sugar content, I'm sure.

Very forgiving recipe - used KA mixer throughout. Proof yeast in KA mixing bowl then add the oil and salt, then add the flour 1 cup at a time with the dough hook on low speed. Once all the dry ingredients are in come up to medium speed for 5 minutes. Then take the dough out, fold it over on itself to redistribute the yeast, make a ball, and place it back in the same bowl after you drizzle a tablespoon of oil (veggie or olive) and turn the dough to coat evenly. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then a kitchen towel.  Can reduce the sugar down to 2 Tbsp for a less-sweet farmhouse-style bread.

A great bread by itself, or by tweaking in a couple ways - substitute 1/3 to 1/2 white whole wheat forthe bread flour and/or 1/4 C honey per loaf and a couple eggs yolks per loaf. Will need to add some flour if adding the honey or egg

I thought 2/3 a cup of sugar was too much it was very sweet. Obviously though some people like that flavor. I've made it again with less sugar but haven't been impressed with that either. The good thing is that both times I made it the loaves rose beautifully and the bread had a great texture. Also, the recipe is very simple and easy to remember. But I didn't think much of the flavor.

I made this in my bread machine on the dough/knead cycle.  Took it out and made rolls with it.  The BEST rolls EVER!  My whole family wants these all the time instead of store bought rolls...and so easy to make.

Well I guess I forgot to review this the first time I made it so I'll do it now. We all loved this bread. The first loaf the kids and my husband ate in 15 minutes. The second loaf I had to guard so that it would make it to dinner. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was a great sweet bread that left the whole party wanting more but I highly recommend baking it a longer time as the listed time is way too short and leaves the bread doughy in the middle.  Once you get past that, it's a great bread, foolproof, just follow the directions.  I also recommend putting an egg bath on the top to get the golden, shiny look.  Bread isn't bread without it!

Well, first of all, I wouldn't recommend doubling this recipe. Or making larger loaves. The two large loaves I made baked for the time said, and despite my cutting them in half, flipping them on their ends, and putting them back in, the middle never cooked.   Second of all, the texture was very dense. Too dense for our liking.  Third, the mini loaves turned out rock hard, even after adjusting temperature & cook time.   We wont be using the recipe again.

I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and brushed with a room temperature egg wash for the final rise.  Beautiful loaves, turned out lovely.  Good texture, nice crust.  Will use this recipe again.

This recipe was great! I made one loaf and 18 rolls from the recipe. I followed the suggestions of others and only added 1/4 cup sugar. I think the most important part to this recipe turning out well is to make sure you use good yeast, the proper temperature of water (110-115F) and let it proof for 10 minutes. At the first rising, the dough had doubled in size in only 30 minutes. I kept the rising dough on top of the stove while the oven was on at 350, I think this also helps. This bread turned out crunchy/golden on the outside and soft on the inside. The rolls took 20 minutes and the bread took 30. It's definitely a good basic bread, I plan on trying this with cardamom/cinnamon, more sugar, and raisins next.  Update: I made this with the right amount of sugar, cinnamon and raisins. It was FANTASTIC. I added 1 cup of raisins before the batter firmed up. Kneaded and let it rise. Separated the dough into 2 pieces. I rolled them both into large circles, wet the tops and then poured a sugar and cinnamon combo on top of each (1/2 cup sugar + 2 tsps cinnamon divided for both). I rolled both up and left one for a loaf. I cut the other into slices to make cinnamon rolls. Let rise for 30 minutes, and then put in oven for 20 (rolls) and 30 (loaf).

As close to Wonder Bread as you can get at home!  I've been looking for a home-made white bread recipe for YEARS that was as close to store-bought as possible...this is it.  My family completely agrees!  Delicious from a bread machine, too!

UPDATE: Made this again today and it was great.  I don't ever use bread flour, but instead all purpose.  I have tried a few times to mix it up and sub some of the white flour for whole wheat, but it's just not the same.  Stick to the recipe and you'll have a delicous sweet-ish white bread fresh from the oven.YUM YUM.

This is a wonderful bread!! My husband and I make it together, by hand, no machines, and we make about 4 to 6 loaves a week for our family of 4. We dont buy bread. It has a nice sweetness which makes great toast, as well as sandwiches, french toast and even garlic toast. We love it and it turns out perfect everytime!!

Really good basic bread recipe.  Only thing I did differently is I used half wheat flour and half white.  I make two loaves every Sunday and I tried cutting the sugar as other reviewers suggest but I highly suggest you don't.  Fantastic and easy recipe, thank you so much!

Wow! That about sums up this awesome bread! I'm relatively new to bread baking and this recipe is so easy. I did take the advice of others and used only 1/3 cup sugar. It turned out great but next time i might try the full amount.

I made this with instant yeast, kneading well and placing directly into the baking pan and letting rise to 1 inch above the edge.  I let it rise in warmth and with a wet cloth on top.  These loaves baked to perfection.  The baking time, for me, was 12 minutes, then rotated in the oven and baked another 3 minutes so it browned evenly.  The crust is super soft.  I lined the whole pan with parchment paper and oiled it well.  This ensures a soft crust.  The whole thing took me an hour to make.

Perfect simple white bread. Hard to mess up. I've tried it with half whole wheat flour and it turned out beautifully as well. I did cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. If you add a little wheat gluten and let the dough get a good rise you'll be rewarded with the fluffiest, creamiest bread you've ever tasted--store bought included.

Easy and quite yummy as is. I don't think it's anything other than it claims to be -- a basic white bread that each baker can tweak to his or her own tastes. ETA: The second time I made this I did some experimenting. Instead of cutting the amount of sugar, I used 2 tablespoons of sugar to proof the yeast and then replaced the rest of the sugar with 1/2 cup of honey, which I added with the other ingredients. The honey adds flavor and reduces that over-sugared flavor.

This was a very simple bread to make from ingredients I always have around the house still waiting to taste it but I trust that it will be spectacular! For all the people who have trouble proofing the bread, try sticking it in the oven with the light on and door closed, DO NOT heat the oven, the light works fine on its own. I live in Canada and even when it is -40C outside and my house is only 17C with drafts my breads/buns always rise beautifully.

I knew this would be a bit too sweet for me, so I cut it back to 1/4 cup honey.  In addition, I beat two egg whites and added them in with the wet ingredients.  You'd be surprised what a bit of beaten egg white can do for bread.  For a fluffy, slightly lighter bread than this recipe, try the Grandma VanDoren's also on this website.  Makes three loaves.  Sooooo good!

Very easy to make and tastes much better than store bread.  The first time I made this I used White Lilly bread flour and it was good.  The second time I made this I used King Arthur bread flour and it was much, much better.  The bread rose higher and it was more fluffy on the inside.  I will definately be making this again.  Also, I am not good at kneading bread dough and this still came out great!!

I guess you could call this no fail, because it comes out great every time and I am no seasoned bread maker.  My family loves it.  Thanks for the recipe.

That was almost too easy!   I followed suggestions from the reviews and cut the sugar.  I ALWAYS make my bread too heavy, so I took any measure to lighten it up.  My daughter had a blast punching the dough and cannot wait for the last loaf to come out of the oven (I promised her some cinnamon toast).    I made one loaf and 5 hoagie rolls for hubbys lunches.  Love it love it love it!!

WOW, this bread is delicious!  It was easy to make as well, even though my bread machine isn't working.  I rolled one loaf and made it into cinnamon swirl bread, and left the other one plain.  The taste is sort of sweet, but my bread was not dense as others have experienced.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

I just made my very first loaf of bread and it came out wonderful.  I cut the recipe in half and made one loaf and used my kitchen aid mixer to mix up the dough. So simple and to think that I was pestering my husband for a bread machine this week.  It is some what sweet tasting but I do not mind at all.

Excellent! This is now my favorite bread recipe.  My husband loves it and it never lasts more than a couple of days.  I served it for dinner guests last night and we polished off the remainder of the loaf with butter and honey (there were only 4 of us and I hate to think of the calories) after we had finished dinner!   I have been using a bread maker for years but found I really enjoyed rolling this out and making a traditional loaf.  It makes a nice soft dough.  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful! It also makes excellent yeast rolls. Split the dough into 12-16 fist sized balls and place them in a pan so they are barely touching. Then coat with warm honey water and bake. So yummy!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I've been looking for a great white bread recipe for months and months.  My husband loves this one, and it is really easy to make.  It will definitely be my standard.  My husband is diabetic, so I replaced the sugar with 1/2 cup of Splenda -- it was just wonderful!  It's so light, moist, and soft.  The two of us polished off half a loaf already!  (We would have liked to finish off the rest of the loaf, but that diet thing reared its head....)  Anyway, thanks for such a wonderful recipe.  I will search no more!

This recipe deserves all the wonderful reviews. I’m new to bread making and have tried a number of recipes but this is the one and it is really so versatile. It makes the best sweet dinner rolls and fantastic cinnamon rolls. I have also reduced the sugar and made a braded loaf, something like an Italian loaf and a regular loaf. This is also a very forgiving recipe, I started out using bread flour, but have now made it with just plain all purpose flour, I’ve added things like garlic powder and Italian seasoning and just can’t seem to mess it up – it has come out great every time. Try it as written and then have some fun with it. Kudos to Peg for such a fantastic recipe.

This receipe is wonderful!  My family (ranging from teenagers to toddlers and a Darling Husband) really enjoyed it.  They actually passed on dessert and had another slice of bread with strawberry jam.  

I did follow the recipe exactly as it was written.  Although I thought 2/3 cup of sugar was alot, it turned out fine.  I will probably cut it back to 1/2 cup next time.  This recipe is one that will be used a lot in my household.  I made sandwiches from the second loaf and they tasted so much better than store bought bread!  I hope this helps encourage you to give bread making a try.  It's worth the extra effort to fill your home with the aroma and pleasure of warm bread.

I halved the recipe and used instant yeast.It was very good and amazingly fluffy. It went really nice for a quick P&J snack. It wasnt too sweet like others had said, but it did get slightly soggy on the bottom, therefore, I would recommend turning it on its side after removing from the pan and letting air circulate it. The bread was brillant.

After reading almost all of the reviews on this recipe, I almost didn't try it. One, I have no electric mixer, having broken it within the last 2 weeks, and two, all of the "it's too sweet" sort of scared me. But I'm glad I forged ahead.

This was the simplest recipe I've tried so far. Not a lot of fiddly ingredients, straight-forward directions. There are three things I changed regarding ingredients: I used 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tsps. of salt, and regular all-purpose flour.

I had no trouble with the yeast/water/sugar at all. I didn't time it; I just watched it until it was good and foamy. I used a whisk to add the flour, one cup at a time. I was able to use the whisk alright for the first 3 cups of flour, and then I simply used my hands to work the last 3 cups of flour in. Not a problem at all.

I kneaded the dough for several minutes and it was just a perfect texture...I was really pleased. I drizzled just a bit of oil over the kneaded dough and worked it all over, then placed it in an oiled glass dish. I placed the dish with the dough into a larger bowl filled with 2 inches of warm water. After 30 minutes, it really hadn't changed at all. So I added more hot water to the larger bowl. After 30 more minutes it had risen a bit, but not double. I then put the entire thing (both bowls, covered with plastic wrap and a dish towel) in the oven, turned the oven on for 30 seconds or so, then shut it off. After another 30 minutes it had risen a lot more. I turned the oven on again for

I would give this 10 stars if I could. It turned out WONDERFUL!  Yum ! I haven't baked bread for over twenty years.  Thank you "Breadguy" for your comments.  I did exactly as the recipe said, used a thermometer on the water. I did cut the sugar to 2 Tablespoons.  The texture was great, color good.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe this weekend!  Thanks to all for the recipe.

Like others, I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  But, I also brushed a mixture of honey and melted butter on the top of the loaf after it had baked, which added a light sweetness that was delicious.

Since I didn't have two loaf pans, I just fashioned half the dough into a round loaf and baked it on a greased cookie sheet.  I think I still prefer the simplicity of store-bought bread for quick sandwiches, but this bread is so good that it was worth the work.

This is a winner!  I tinkered with the recipe a bit.  I added an egg and decreased the sugar by about 1/2, and it turned out perfect!  Just the right light "yeasty" taste without being overpowering.  Oooh, this stuff is good!

I, like other bakers, used 2 cups ww flour and 4 cups AP flour.  Instead of sugar, I used a little less than 2/3 cup honey.  I hadn't made homemade bread for a while, and my kids were excited to eat it.  Like others have said, it is nice and soft, not too dense.  We'll keep this recipe and try making rolls and cinnamon rolls with the dough too.

Okay, revised.  Still wow, wow, wow, this is one of the easiest and tastiest breads I've ever made.  I've cut the sugar per other reviewers.  I've also used 1/3 wheat flour and that made a really nice, light wheat loaf.  We've been going through a loaf a day!  One thing, though, I've used all purpose and bread flour, and the bread flour has been the thing to take it from really good bread to great!

I didn't think this had too much flavor, even for a plain white bread.  It was very easy to make though, and a great recipe for my first time making it.  I did not get any compliments on it at thanksgiving though, and that is NOT what I am used to!!

OMG...i didn't know what i was missing till i tried this bread. IT IS WONDERFUL...goodbye store bought bread (sorry Sara Lee, you been good to me, but ya know) and Hello homemade bread. I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and it turned out wonderfully! When my dough was in the loaf pans it didn't rise 1 inch past the pan after 30 min. So i waited 45 min and it still hadn't risen...so i just threw it in the oven and it turned out great.

Brilliant, Brilliant recipe.  Halved this to make just the one loaf. Put all the ingredients into the pan of my bread maker in the order you normally would, water and oil, followed by the flour and then the other dry ingredients and then used the setting for white bread 1 1/2 lb loaf.  Three hours later, a perfect loaf.  And it tastes just delicious.  Will definately be making this again!

Great Recipe!  This was the best white yeast bread I have ever made.  I did take another members suggestion and used 1/4-cup sugar.  The bread had a light sweet taste and was very moist with a thin crust.  Perfect for sandwiches or jelly toast (my girls love it fresh from the oven).  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

This is the best bread recipe I have ever used.  I did not change one thing about it, and the bread comes out perfect every time.  It is the most versitile bread recipe.  I have made cinnamon bread, sticky buns, Parker House rolls, and just plain bread with the recipe.  Thanks!!

Terrific recipe, Peg!  I mixed the bread dough in my bread machine and let it knead and rise and knead a second time.  I then divided it into two loaf pans and let it rise again.  My husband shared one loaf with his coworkers and they really enjoyed it.  I really like the bread toasted, but you'll enjoy it however you choose to eat it!

This was my first attempt at making a loaf of bread without my machine.  It was fabulous!  I've already made 4 loaves, one of which I gave as a hostess gift.  Delicious!  I did brush my second batch with melted butter upon coming out of the oven, and it gave a prettier appearance, as well as added that yummy butter taste.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!  The only thing I did differently is I added some extra flour.  Rises very well.  Makes a nice soft bread perfect for sandwiches, and did not find it too dense.  I brush my loaves with butter as soon as they leave the oven.  This recipe is a keeper, and I may not go back to store bought bread.

IM IN HEAVEN- I am eating my bread as I am typeing. I made this recipe and it came out perfect. What really sent it over the edge is that I toppped it with homemade butter (heavy whipping cream and salt) and also the homemade apple butter I made a few days ago. The whole deal makes me want to move to the country and give up pre made foods all together. I guess a girl can have her dream  YUMMM!!!

This bread is amazing. It is so easy to make and turns out wonderful every time. I use extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My family and friends love this bread. I recently made homemade strawberry jam and the two combined are a slice of heaven. If you've never made bread before try this recipe. You won't be disappointed. Happy baking!

It was tasty, but it didn't rise much at all.  Probably would make again with less sugar.  Not living in the states anymore, I'm not used to sandwich bread being this sweet, so I just dunked it in my coffee since it was so flat anyway.  But  it did taste nice so it gets 4/5.

YUM!  I have never made bread before, but have wanted to for a long time.  This recipe was easy, and turned out great!  I made one loaf and made the other into cinnamon rolls, which I had also never done.  I just rolled them out, melted butter, added brown sugar and cinnamon and spread it on.  They were great!  My husband also LOVED both the rolls and the bread.  I might try making the bread with only 1/2 c sugar sometime just to see, but I did like the sweetness.  THANKS for the great recipe!

Awsome bread!! I think I will reduce the sugar by a couple of tablespoons next time (even though I love the sweetness! - but just to make them a wee bit healthier).  I also added 1/2 cup bakers special milk (from King Arthur Flour), three Tablespoons soy granular lechithin (to help give it a longer shelf life - also available at King Arthur Flour Baker's Catalog) and reduced oil to 2 Tbsp (and added about 1/4 additional water. These loaves turned out very high, perfect texture and flavor - Will DEFINITELY make again!!  Thanks for the recipe!

FIVE STARS! Yes, this recipe is easy and comes out perfectly. I used half the dough for one loaf of bread and the other half to make cinnamon rolls, which turned out the best I have ever made. Follow the recipe exactly and you'll have perfect white bread.  I will never try another recipe for white bread again. I found the winner!

Wonderful! When I saw this recipe on the top 20 list, I knew I had to try it. It was so easy to make! I was a little worried at first because I had no bread flour, and I only had bread machine yeast. But, it worked out fine. It made the best bread I have ever made, and I have tried several recipes. Next time I am going to use a bread machine and see how that works. I did not think it was too sweet in the least. I used the recommended amount of sugar and thought it was perfect. A lot of the other reviews said to cut the sugar in half, I wouldn't. My bread did not raise one inch over the pan, but that is probably because I did not have bread flour. I also put my bread in a 170 degree oven to rise, this worked wonderfully. However, next time I will put a damp towel over it because the top got a little dry. All in all this is the best bread on earth!! Almost one whole loaf was gone before it had even cooled! I just ate two pieces with butter! I am going to have more for supper along side a big bowl of homemade soup! Yum Yum! Thank you so much for this recipe! I printed it, and I am going to make it again and again and again!

This is the recipe I use to make my bread about every 3 days.  I double the recipe so that it will make 4 loaves.  4 loaves fit accross the oven, so it just makes it easier to make more at a time.  Sweet and moist - hearty and delicious!!!  Great for everything, sandwiches, toast, or whatever you like.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This was my first time making a basic white bread and it turned out beautifully, I was so proud of myself! Based on other reviews I cut the sugar in half since I didn't want it too sweet. My husband ate almost half the loaf himself at dinner and said to definitely make it again. To get the dough to rise properly, I heated up the oven just a little and then put the dough in there to rise. This recipe really is fool-proof.

It's been a while since I've made white bread from scratch but I was having one of those "earth mother" days and breadmaking fulfills my need to nuture. We loved this recipe.  Dough was tender; I used only 5 cups, reserving 1 cup of flour for kneading so as not to add too much flour, toughening the dough.  I found I didn't need the entire amount.  Dough rose beautifully, and baked golden brown and soft.  Aroma filled the house with homemade goodness.  And I won't go into how heavenly it was...warm with melted butter.

This is by far the best homemade bread I have ever had.  I halved the ingredients and ran my bread machine on the dough cycle (after proofing the yeast).  Then I punched the dough down and put it into a loaf pan to rise again.  It always turns out wonderful.  Once it rose so high the top of the bread hit the oven top, the pan was on the middle oven rack!  I make this very often and everyone loves it!

Like others, I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup (you can also use honey--light and sweet).  I rolled pepperoni and cheese cubes in one loaf and cinnamon/sugar/melted butter (with a white icing on the top-after the bread had cooled) for the second loaf.  They were both awesome and the men at our football party wouldn't stop eating! I was so happy that my husband loved it-this was only my second time making bread and I looked like a professional--I'll definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is amazing! This is the second time I've ever made bread and it was so easy, not to mention really tasty. It's a little heavier than normal bread and very sweet, so we liked it best eaten on its own. This is my usually-unimpressed husband's favorite bread now.

This is a wonderfully easy sweet bread that I use as a base for countless variations.  I use it to make cinnamon rolls, or to make a jelly roll style loaf with raisins or cranberries.  Sometimes I substitute 1/2 cup of oat bran for 1/2 cup of flour.  For a nutty flavor I add a half cup of grape nuts to the dough.  

Just an excellent simple starting place for some of my favorite kitchen experiments!

This is a simple recipe for an excellent sandwich bread.  It has a soft and fluffy texture that makes an ordinary turkey sandwich feel like a trip to the deli.  Very similar to sourdough, but without the growth in the fridge.

I have been searching for a recipe for Amish bread ever since I had some while visiting family in Missouri.
Missouri has a large Amish Community, and we had the best bread in the world while we were there...
This bread is every bit as good in my opinion and is going into my "keepers" file right away!
It was easy to make, and delicious.

The 1st time I made it I made it on convection+microwave option. It turned out crisp like a toast. Tasting great.My daughter and I loved it. My husband refuesed to touch it though. The second time it turned out all burnt. Again it was conv+micro. The third time it came out fantastic.My husband said,"good show, woman." Everyone loved it. I think it is  great. I reduced the sugar and used the plain al purpose flour. Thanks.

Very easy to make. Makes the bread dense/heavy. I prefer light and fluffy breads, however, so I only give it 4 stars.

RITA - you might need new yeast.
I made this dough for the second time yesterday and used 1/4 cup of sugar and it really turned out perfect for my taste.  This is just a really great recipe.

This recipe is excellent.  Depending on the house conditions you need to adjust the yeast.  I also live near an Amish community and noticed that they use brown sugar instead of white, so I switched.  Either way this is an excellent bread recipe.

I love it.  My first time making bread and it came out perfect.  Cut the recipe in half and no problems.  

Have a feeling I will be making this a lot...

This is very good and easy to make.  I also use less sugar, about 1/3 cup.

Bread was very good.  Has a nice, almost sweet flavor.  Didn't use all the flour though...had to add some water to get it all to mix.  Probably about 1 cup of flour that wasn't used.  Bake in miniature pans for a great gift.

Soft and moist! I have reduced the amount of sugar but it is still a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar by half and add bit more salt, cos I like bit salty  bread for sandwiches. Thanks for this great recipe.

Good, but it definetly needs more than 30 minutes to cook, I'd say 35 minutes on the oven.  It is very yummy, my first white bread from scratch.

This was my first attempt at making homemade bread (without the machine). Although it was time-consuming, it was very easy to make.  The taste was slightly sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The texture was light and airy with a slightly crisp crust. My husband and I both liked it and we'll make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly in my bread machine (reduced to 18 servings).  The best bread I've made.  Fantastic crumb--a very nice sandwich loaf.

This makes such a wonderful loaf of bread! I don't buy bread any more-I make this instead. I do cut the sugar back to about 1/3 cup though (or less) because my family wasn't too sure about the sweetness. Other than that it makes a perfect loaf of bread!

This Bread Recipee is delicious!...It Is very moist and I will definately make it again..This bread is Very sweet...it is good with butter...but I suggest that you lower the sugar lever to 1/4 cup...it makes the bread not so sweet..so you can use it for sandwiches...The bread turnes out perfect!

This bread is FANTASTIC!!! I made one loaf (halved the recipe) just in case my family did not like it. Well, that was a mistake, it was a great hit. The bread was gone in no time flat. I made the whole recipe two days later. I am sure I will be making more by weeks end. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe was a lifesaver for me!  I have kids with food allergies so this no egg, no milk, no soy(I use canola oil)recipe is wonderful!  I make rolls out of it and even cinnamon rolls. I like to add a cup or two of wheat bread and it still tastes great.

I found this recipe too dense and too "yeasty" in my opinion. I followed the recipe to the letter. I didn't notice it being too sweet and I'm not a fan of sugar. I didn't use a mixer, but my own hands and added barely any flour to knead. 

I'm disappointed, especially when this recipe got so many good reviews. I'll probably try to make this once more.

I have made this twice now, the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was good. It was kind of dense though, so when i made it the second time, I let it raise for the first hour, punched it down, and let it raise again for about 20 minutes, then put it in bread pans, and let it raise for ANOTHER hour, it takes a lot longer, but the results were WELL worth it. I made two loaves last night, and they are both already gone!!
The other thing I like about this recipe is that it was SO MUCH EASIER than a lot of other bread recipes I have tried, I think because it uses water and oil, instead of milk and butter.
overall it's really good, and I will be making it to take to my Mother-In-Law for Thanksgiving.

This is a simple and easy recipe. I had given up making homemade bread because it took all day. Even the bread machine doesn't make a delicious bread as this. It is so easy, and with a little patience (waiting for the yeast to proof and the two risings) you will have a great looking, smelling and tasty loaf of bread. This recipe is going in my recipe box and I will hand it out to others.

We love this recipe. To make this in a bread machine (2lb loaf), just adjust the servings so that the flour comes out to 4 1/2 cups.

This was surprisingly easy and sweet. However, mine came out a little dry, but that could be because I added too much flour. My dough was too sticky, so I added more flour. I followed other's suggestions and made one loaf cinnamon swirl and it was really yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

VERY good. I made it into dinner rolls instead of loaves because we had a huge ham for dinner and we all love leftover ham sandwiches on fresh rolls.  I had to hide some of them because our guests were gobbling them up so quickly that I didn't think there would be any left.  Very moist bread with a great homemade freshness to it.  A definite keeper!

I have a white bread recipe that I've been very happy with but I've seen so many great reviews for this Amish bread that I wanted to give it a try. I added four tablespoons of buttermilk powder and left everything else the same. It turned out delicious!! We had it fresh from the oven last night. Made toast for breakfast this morning and Texas toast to go with our spaghetti tonight. This makes a simple bread that can be used so many way..and the taste and texture is fantastic. Thank you Peg, loved it!

This was my first ever attempt at bread making, and it was great bread....the kids especially loved it!! I did read through the reviews first and I cut down on the sugar by half as suggested, and it was a tasty, not-too-sweet bread...delicious with butter. I have added this recipe to my recipe box and I will make it again and again!! :)

I've tried many a bread recipe in my day, and this is one of my all time favorites.  The bread is a wee bit sweeter than I like my sandwich bread to be, but it is so light and fluffy that I'm too chicken to mess with the recipe! Excellent bread.  Works well substituting 1/3 of the clour for wheat and subbing sugar for honey.

Absolutely great bread recipe. The only problem I had occurred when I mixed the dough in the bread machine the first time I made it. I think this added the flour too fast, and this recipe really needs the flour to add in slow. It still rose but it took a long time! The second time I made it by hand, and it was just fine. The bread has a great, slightly sweet taste, and the texture is wonderful.

Very good! A touch too sweet for me but my guy just LOVED it!!  He's begging me to make it again!  I'll probably cut the sugar in 1/2, but I'll definatley be making it again this weekend!

I have been on a very tight budget lately and with 3 kids we miss store bought bread for PB&J sandwiches.  Well after many different recipes we've finally found the perfect recipe!  We haven't missed store bought bread in weeks!  I use half white, half whole wheat flour and it always turns out light and tasty.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!

This recipe really was easy just like everyone said!  I followed everyone's recommendation and only used about 1/3 cup of sugar.  It was so yummy!  We made cinnamon toast with this bread on Saturday morning and it was wonderful!  I fely pampered having homemade bread in the house!

This recipe is wonderful.  I'd kept the bread in the frig wrapped in foil and it doesn't dry out.   It's great for toast.  Haven't tried freezing yet.  It's moist, tasty and much better than our "store-bought" white bread here in the USA.  My ""picky"" husband that wouldn't eat his mother's bread loves this one.

Recently, I started baking again after a long absence. I thought I'd lost touch.  Tried some of the recipes with starters and felt something was wrong with me.  This recipe helped me realize it's just the recipe not the baker/cook.

Thank you for this recipe.

I don't know why I never made bread before.  This bread was very good and so easy.  The second loaf made a nice gift to my neighbor.  I will make this bread often.

Despite the fact that this was my first time effort, this bread turned out great! I used whole wheat flour (the supermarket was out of white) and it was really good brown bread. I cut the sugar to just over a 1/3 cup (it took a while for the yeast to proof) like others suggested and it was the right sweetness. My arms started to get tired, though, after so much kneading--I'm definitely sharing that task with somebody next time.

Easy-peasy... this bread is truly AWESOME! I've even made it into cinnamon swirl bread by just rolling out, brushing melted butter on it, sprinkling with cinnamon sugar, roll it up like a jelly roll, placing it in the loaf pan,then  baking as directed! Gotta try it! My kids love this bread! Most definitely a keeper!

I'm a "new-bie" baker and this turned out great! One secret I've found in baking which I'm sure goes for most all recipes is that you need to keep dough warm to get it to rise better.  I stick mine in the microwave while rising (do NOT turn microwave on) , because it's warmer in there than sitting on my counter. Thanks Peg!

Good bread recipe, although not the best I've ever tried.  The flavor was great, but I think my water was too hot (killed the yeast) because the dough hardly rose at all.  In any case, my little sister LOVED it, and there weren't any leftovers.

A very excellent sweet white bread.  Problem is it doesn't last long in my house.  Very yummy, expecially warm and lathered in butter.  Can't make it very often or I will have to go back on a diet.

This is the best white bread ever!!  It has a lovely crumb and is not too soft.  I make it into rolls and my family can't keep away.  They are my biggest request! The sweetness is perfect with savory and sweet fillings.  Makes two good sized loafs and 48 dinner rolls. A keeper!

This is good bread, though I cut the sugar down to  scant 1/2 cup, used the same amount of yeast but made one loaf at a time...I tried it the second time around with 1/2 cup old fashioned oats (and cut down on some of the flour), and this was good too.  This recipe is a keeper.

I have made this recipe quite a few times now and it has always been well received. I've made the standard white loaf and also raisin cinnamon bread as well as garlic pull-apart bread; the bread adapts beautifully to these flavors.

Awesome bread.  It's the best I've ever made.  It is the worth the time to make this recipe.   I have made it many times since I found it and everyone wants me to bake them a loaf.  I usually bake a double batch and give a loaf away.  Which is always appreciated.

This is probably the best bread that I have ever had.  But I did try a little switch in it.  I half the flour with wheat flour.  and made Amish Wheat Bread and it was great.  So try that next time you get a chance.

This is the best bread I have ever made. I made it yesterday, today and I am baking it again tomorrow. It is so easy and delicious. My 2 year old loved helping me stir it and knead it. This has definately become a family favorite.

Absolutely delicious.  Hurricane Florence just went through our area, Wilmington, NC.  Although power was restored, no stores were open, so I made this bread.  I haven’t toasted it yet, but this is a keeper.

After dividing the dough in half, I rolled it out flat and rectangular. Then I rolled it from the end rather tightly and let it rise the final time.  Add another 15 minutes to the rise and the tightly rolled loaf rises without huge air holes and won’t tear as easily when putting on spreads.   I also used only 1/4 cup sugar and it tastes great!

I love this Recipe! The Bread is Very moist and airy. the flavor of the bread has a nice sweet note to it which tastes amazing fresh out of the oven.  On top of that, unlike regular dense dry loafs, It has the right texture to even eat it plain with nothing on it. Also if that's not enough, it is Super Quick and easy to make, so even a non-experienced baker can accomplish a yummy final product. All in all I would highly recommend this recipe

I've made this with bread flour and with AP flour. Bread flour was by far the best. The AP flour turned out more dense like a cake, whereas the bread flour was lighter and less chewy.

I used the recipe exactly and the bread came out nice. I could’ve left in in the oven for a few more minutes maybe, but it was still good. Just under.

SO FLUFFY!!! I changed to make one loaf. I only added 1tbsp + 1tsp of sugar. Followed everything else exactly. Made in my kitchen aid mixer and let it knead for 5 mins alernating between low and medium speed. Let it rest the first time with the wet towel draped over in the oven with the light on.
My husband and I ate half the loaf in one sitting. Its so fluffy and light. This will be my go to bread, my only regret was I didnt make both loaves!!

Easy recipe.  Makes good bread.  I cut the sugar in half after the first time I made it; it was too sweet.  Makes great loaves and dinner rolls.

Wow! I can't believe it turned out that well.  I made cake and this at the same time. My entire family loves and says I'm going to make it again, so I'm definitely making it again.

I've made this several times and it always turns out beautifully. Sometimes I substitute a few cups of stone ground flour to make it a wheat loaf. Yum!!  Sometimes I roll cinnamon sugar and raisins up in it to make a raisin loaf. You can go a lot of different ways with this recipe. It's excellent

Loved this  recipe.  However I did use a mixer with a dough hook.  This bread makes a terrific sandwich.  This bread stays fresh several days.  Making more now!

This a great and simple bread recipe for the experienced bread maker or if it is your first time making your own bread. this makes two very nice sweet white loaves that do well with sandwiches and makes an awesome french toast.

For the first time breadmaker, just follow the recipe as it is. I use either Feishman's or red dot yeast. Make sure the package says quick , instant, or rapid acting.  Other yeasts will do the job but they take longer to rise and are more finicky about temperature.

I have adjusted the recipe a bit for my everyday use, I use 1/4 cup softened butter instead of the oil, I also use 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup water for the liquid. I think it improves the taste a bit . I like the buttery taste in my bread.

Love this bread.  It is devoured promptly after it is removed from the oven.  I usually make three or 4 loaves each week.  We like to give away fresh bread to friends.  Our friends constantly rave about this bread. We have tried other recipes but this is the best.  I cook mine for less time in our oven.  It is not unusual for cooking times to vary from oven to oven.

I liked it but this recipe is way too sweet for my taste unless it is to be toast for jam. It was easy to prepare and a nice texture. 

I made one loaf and 8 large buns from one batch. The buns baked 24 minutes to a golden doneness.  I tried to brush garlic salted butter on them to cut the sweetness for a more savoury dinner roll but it was just a sweet garlic bun. . Ha! My kids ate them and I haven't finished the bread yet but my gut tells me a loaf of this size at 350 degrees will take more like 45 minutes to bake. Will keep this easy recipe to tweak to my taste.

This is hands down the BEST bread recipe I have made. It is so easy and has just enough sweetness to it. I found that it is best to let the bread cool completely in the pan before cutting so it does not lose its shape. This one is going in my recipe books!

Love this bread and its a hit for the family. Its not dense when i make it. So watch your flour. Too much flour will make it like that. Make sure when you scoop the flour isnt packed. Ive made this mistake many times in my learning journey of baking. Since i learned this everything comesout great.

I made this bread and like some of the other reviews I cut the sugar to 2 teaspoons.  It is easy, easy, easy to make.  If I make it again I will cut the receipe in half.  It seemed to dry out after a day or two and with two loaves difficult for just me and my husband to use up.  By day three I had to toast it with butter because it was so dry.  It was the first time I have ever made homemade white bread and it was a breeze to make.  I did keep the loaves in plastic so they wouldn't dry out but it didn't help.  The first day it was fabulous.

I'm honestly amazed. I've been baking for years now even though I'm only 21. This is by far the best white bread recipe I've used! I did make a mistake and threw the oil into the dough, but that might be the reason my bread came out so soft. I also replaced 1 c. of the bread flour with all purpose. Those were the only two changes I made and I plan on keeping these changes whenever I make this bread. So soft and mildly sweet. Makes amazing sandwiches!

This bread was awesome.  It was only my second time making yeast bread and it was perfect.  It was soft and tasty.  The only change I made was using organic sugar instead of white sugar.  I am giving one loaf to my mother so I have to make two more, today, so that my husband and daughter won't cry.

I have been searching for the perfect bread recipe that was crazy soft, has the perfect flavor and didn't require a bread machine or kitchen aide. If you are also searching for it look no further! This bread is fabulous! It is so soft and contrary to my original concerns about such a large amount of sugar in this bread, it actually wasn't sweet at all yet had a very savory flavor. I'd say it was similar to a buttermilk bread but not quite as sour. The only things I really did to the recipe, was make sure to brush the whole loaf with melted butter after it was baked but still hot. This doesn't effect the flavor so much as just the texture of the crust, it makes it incredibly soft. I also didn't follow the secondary rising time. I let the dough rise in the bread pan to the desired shape and size I wanted the loaf. I will definitely be sticking to this recipe from here on out.

The only change I would make for future loaves to extend the baking time by 10-15 minutes.  My loaves were still slightly doughy in the center.  Otherwise an awesome tasting bread.

This is an excellent bread recipe. I tried it as written and it was a bit too sweet for me, so like many others I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. But, if you like your bread on the sweet side then keep the amount as written. It takes me significantly longer than written on both rises, usually 2 hours on the first rise & 1.5 hours on the second. I have made this bread numerous times and my family loves it. I now make it weekly and we easily eat both loves.

Everyone loves it ! This is the first time I have gotten bread to come out right! It is on the sweeter side but so delicious. I used a regular loaf pan and also a Pullman loaf pan without the lid. I did slice into it while still warm and it was so delicious no butter etc needed! I used the Pullman loaf the next day for sandwiches. Also I used whole wheat bread flour and all organic ingredients. Mmm Mmm thanks for the recipe!

I use all purpose flour.  Comes out perfect everytime. Proof yeast 10 minutes.  Knead 8 minutes , punching down is important. I rise for an hour sometimes.  Makes 2 large loaf on my parchment paper covered cookie sheet. Yummo !!!

My family absolutely loved it! I will never buy bread again! A few changes I made thanks to some reviews I read was to only use 1/3cup of sugar so it wouldn't be so sweet. Once it had risen I made half of the dough into the bread. And the other half I turned into sweet raisin bread. I mixed the white bread with raisins, after that I rolled out the dough and spread butter on it and sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon. Finally I rolled it all in and put it in the pan. It was great!

Great simple recipe, I let it rise a bit longer to ensure bread was not to dense. Followed the recipe this time but will for sure cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup as many suggested! This will be one to keep and make weekly!

Made correctly this bread is soft, fluffy, and delicious!!! I don't know if this will help anyone, but I too had problems with my bread coming out dense. I think I've pin pointed a few thing that might be contributing to this. The first few times I made this I paid extra attention to the yeast due to the reviews. Then I got into a hurry once and made a few errors. The result being dense and not so great bread. I put together a few tips since then to prevent this problem. 1. Having your water too hot  can kill your yeast, it really does only need to be warm! 2. Use a smaller bowl for your dough to set in. The dough uses the sides of the bowl to 'cling' to as it rises. Too large of a bowl can cause your dough to sink into itself. 3. Really watch your flour and salt! Salt will hinder the growth of the yeast, you'll notice a distinct decline in the  height of your dough if you use too much salt. The recommended amount in the recipe should be followed closely. Following these tips alone I've not had to start weighting my flour out. If you continue having issues after making these changes I would recommend doing that as well!

have made this several times when I want an easy bread to make.  I would def recommend cutting the sugar down, I usually cut it in half. A good trick for making sure your dough rises is before you start your recipe, heat your oven to 200 degrees F and once it's there, immediately shut it off. By the time you are ready to let the dough rise, it will be optimal temp. If you think it's too hot, open the door and cool it for a bit. Works every time.

This recipe did not turn out for me. The dough didn't mix well and turned into chunks of dough rather than one ball. It was also far too sweet for my taste. I make bread regularly but clearly this was not my best work and the flavor wasn't good enough to try again.

I made this, instead of 2 loafs i made one loaf of bread and flattened the other and turned it into pizza, it was 100% a favorite with my family. next i might use the dough to make cinnamon rolls, or flat bread! maybe even dinner rolls!

This recipe is fool proof. I have made it 4 times and we love it. I use a regular thermometer to measure the temp of the water. I also set the bowl of sugar/yeast water in the sink so it sits in warm water while it proofs too. I do let the doe rise longer on the second step, it just takes longer for it to rise 1in above my pans for some reason. Excellent taste, dense and sweet. And it's dairy free and no expensive bread maker/machine necessary.

I have to give this recipe a fiver. Directions and ingredients were spot on! If you proof your yeast, but it doesn't rise in the time amount specified, I recommend giving it atleast another 30min. My only complaint isn't even legitimate being that this is AMISH white bread, and since I'm new to this kind of bread I have to assume that it being slightly sweet is typical. This recipe seems like it would also make good Raisin Bread.

I really liked this bread.  It is denser than most breads I have made which I like.  And with all the sugar, it has a sweeter taste too, also the salt really lends a nice flavor.  It does taste like "Amish" white bread we get at the Amish bakery in Sugarcreek Ohio.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and while kneading had to add an extra cup of white flour to keep it elastic and not sticking.  Thanks for posting this recipe, it is my "go to" bread from now on.

Patience is key. Your bread may take a bit longer to rise.  Pay attention to the amount of rise not the amount of time.  But you'll be rewarded with a simple and sweet bread!

This bread is delicious and SO easy to make!!  My 8 year old daughter loved helping knead the dough too!  It IS a little sweet but it is very good!!  It's a great wintertime bread, very hearty with soup and chili!  GREAT warm with butter!  Yum!!!  My husband and kids LOVED it!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe!  I love the fact they have you proof the yeast first.  This is a step left out of many recipes.  I added about 1/2 tsp more of yeast.  I also have made this recipe with more sugar.  All versions have been delicious so far.  I make this recipe without a mixer or bread  machine.  It is SO easy to do by hand!

My family loved this bread! I found it quite dense, I will also adjust the cooking time next time I try it, it was still doughy in the middle. Will try it again before I decide if it's a keeper or not.

Made this bread today and it was very easy and turned out great! This was only my second time making bread from scratch because the first time was so labor intensive that I gave up. This went so well that I plan to make it again soon. Did not have bread flour and used all-purpose flour and it still turned out great.

This was my first time trying to make bread, and it turned out absolutely wonderful! So simple and easy. Followed the recipe exactly, a little shy on the sugar. It does remind me of the Kings Hawaiian bread.

Simple and delicious! Substitute a few cups of wheat flower for a healthier option. I refuse to buy from the supermarket after finding this recipe.

Very easy to make.  I divide my loaves into three instead of the two posted in the recipe, and use the full amount of sugar ( I have a huge sweet tooth) ...My neighbor gave me some yeast from Costco and it seems to stretch the dough for this recipe.  I also use a kitchen aid mixer and I only use about 5 1/2 cups of flour because my machine gets too wobbly.  If I find the dough too sticky when I take it out of the bowl when stirred I just add more flour when I kneed it before proofing it in the oiled bowl.  This recipe doesn't contain eggs so if you have people that have allergies to eggs this is a fantastic recipe.  I have stopped my search for the perfect bread recipe!Thank goodness for Amish and old school recipes from the past.....

My first time baking bread and I have to say, its the BEST bread I've ever eaten!!  I'm shocked that I actually made home made bread!  It is a little labor/time intensive, but WELL WORTH it!  Do it ONCE, you'll be hooked!!  I followed the first reviewers instructions as I made it with my kitchenaid and dough hook and it was easy. The most difficult thing about it was the water temperature. Really "warm" was what I would call it. NOT hot, not "Luke warm" either Best to use candy thermometer to be sure around 110*.  If time permits, I'm baking bread weekly, no more store bought!  Thanks for awesome reviews... so helpful!!  *I only used 1/3 c of sugar as I didn't want "sweet" bread, just nicely flavored sandwich bread.  Think I'll stick with that amount.

I love this recipe I make it all the time.
Make sure you don't have expired yeast and like the directions say put 1 cup of flour in at a time you may not  use all 6 cups of flour and only use enough flour I ntil the dough is no longer sticky, the dough is so easy to work with and the bread lasts longer then the bread that has eggs and milk in it ??

I make this 2-3 times a week.  Some notes:  1)This is a perfect first recipe for someone wanting to try making bread. 2) There is a lot of sugar in this bread, and it is sweet.  3)  The toast from this bread is incredible, probably due to the sugar (think "roasted marshmallow" for as sugar is heated).  4)  My rise times are very much slower than advertised, perhaps 6 hours or longer, due to a cold apt (70 degrees) or perhaps not kneading it enough?  But the "bread experts" tell me this is okay, and in fact, desirable.  5)  I put "some" molasses (1/3 cup?) into a batch once to rave reviews (reduced the amount of sugar a bit tho, perhaps to 1/3 cup).

Made this bread 5 times. Love it! I've used different amounts of sugar every time. 1/3C is the best. I also started my water at 48degrees. The bowl & waiting for the sugar will bring it down to 45degrees by time you add your yeast. Wait about 10 mins for yeast to proof. I use stand mixer. This bread is so easy. I've only needed 5 1/2 cups adding 1C at a time.

I was so pleased with the taste of this bread!  I cut back the sugar to 2 Tablespoons, and it was perfect.  When I need a sweeter bread, I'll add the extra sugar, as it will probably make great cinnamon rolls.  Recipe is easy to follow.

I used fast rising yeast because it was my third try to get the dough to rise. Also, my house is cold so i put the dough in the oven covered with damp cloth at 170 F for ten mins and turned it off and left the dough in there for an hour. It rose great and the bread was soft.

This rose perfectly and looked beautiful but the bread was too sweet. I wasn't expecting it to taste like a Hawaiian bread. If you looked past the sweetness, it was pretty good.

Very good.  I have made this several times and not been disappointed yet.  I agree with some of the other reviews- it is very sweet as written.  I usually cut the sugar by about half. This recipe is definitely my new go-to for white bread.

This is an easy, yummy bread.  I followed the recipe as written, used a kitchen aid mixer, and it came out perfectly fluffy.  Maybe next time I'll try a little less sugar, but it was wonderful as is.  A definite keeper.

I'be had a few bad experiences trying to bake bread in the past and was hesitant to try this recipe since it seemed so easy. It look me a few months to build up the courage to try it. I was very pleased and will use this as my go to recipe for bread.

I cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us. I substituted a half cup of whole wheat flour just because I was feeling adventurous, even though it's supposed to be white bread.

I used melted coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil and it was delicious. It makes it sweeter so it's more of a breakfast/ snack bread.

Great slicing bread. I reduced the sugar as well and allowed the bread machine to mix flour and knead and rise, then divided to the pans for rising. Great result! Great base to add to or eat as is.

Best bread I've ever made. Makes 25 lovely rolls in a large square pan too. I have requests for more already and I am glad it is easy to make without butter or any fancy ingredients or machines. I may decrease the sugar a bit next time but it was very popular as sweet rolls.

This is a delicious bread.  I did a few alterations after the first try. I found that 2 tbsp. of sugar was all that was needed.  I have been switching it up some and substituted 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and a 1/2 cup of ground flax.  Still rises beautifully and gives the bread a little more substance.

This has proven to be my go-to bread that my family loves.  We find that this bread unlike some recipes has a good shelf life and is not to quick to go stale.  Have also made variations of this using molasses instead of white sugar.

this bread is great I have made it a dozen or so times...for those who don't make bread be patient...let it fully rise and make sure you use a candy or meat thermometer because that 110 degrees f is critical 105-115.

Great recipe, since we're using it for Texas French Toast didn't mind the sweetness.  Will try a little less sugar when using it for sandwiches, but loved the results for 1st attempt.

Family loved it.  This cooks up a little larger than the breadmaker can handle so if you typically use the breadmaker you may want to consider prepping the dough in the maker and then transferring the tray to the oven.

Loved it!!!!  The easiest and most tasty recipe ever!!!  Ladies for those of you who had issues making this recipe, please ensure you are using fresh yeast or your bread will not rise. This recipe should call for patience. If you are in a rush this recipe is not for you!!!  I used this recipes to make cinnamon rolls and cheese stuffed dinner rolls. The best ever!!!!

I'd never made bread from scratch before.  Almost a fool proof recipe.  I used my ninja dough blade to mix the first batch, I didn't check the temp on my water before adding the yeast, and I ended up putting all the dough into my 13x4x4 USA bread pan (worth every penny guys).  The bread was great for the most part, but a little underdone in the center, rose out of the pan a bit, and it had a slight "yeasty" taste.  

The next batch I made, I actually made sure the water temp was around 110, and I put only 2/3 of the dough into my 13x4x4 bread pan...I put the remaining 1/3 of dough into a separate 9x5x2.75 pan.  I also kneaded the dough by hand this time (for only about 2 min). --- TURNED OUT PERFECT.  I mean it is ridiculous how painless this was to make.  I used it for sandwiches, toast, and dipping into an herbed olive oil...yumminess.

Had not made bread in years since the bread machine broke.  Wife bought me a KitchenAid mixer so figured I'd give this a shot.  1st time was a success and we love the taste/texture.  Making another batch today.  Literally just dump all the dry ingredients into the mixer, including the yeast, let it run for a minute, then add 112-degree water (I do measure the temp), let it run for a minute then add the oil.  To rise I put the bowl in the utility room where the furnace and water heater are.

Reliable recipe that never fails to turn out.  I have made exactly as written (except for halving it so I make one loaf at a time) at least 20 times.  It is very forgiving re rise time, room temperature (winter versus summer), yeast age, etc.  It is simply reliable, and the result is very good bread that holds together well in the toaster for a great breakfast (with a little butter).  Thanks for sharing.

Update:  I have reduced the sugar to generate a lighter bread.  I usually make one loaf at a time, so that would be 1/3 cup sugar using the recipe.  I use a little less than 1/4 cup, and it turns out great.  I use a stand mixer to knead, and add flour  until the dough cleans the bowl.  After the first rise, I use the mixer to knead the dough for a couple of minutes before it goes into the loaf pan.

I love this recipe. For those of you that said it turned out too dense and that it called for too much flour, how much flour a bread recipe calls for is more like a guideline. Altitudes, climate, and even seasons will change how much you put in. I myself have varied a whole cup amount in the same location, but the season was different. After you've added the first 3 cups you want to add just half a cup at a time so it doesn't end up too dense. The less flour you add, the lighter/fluffier it will be. If it is still sticky but can stay in one piece if you hold it up, that's about where you want it. I just made it yesterday again but did half brown wheat and half white and my husband and I both liked it better. I always get compliments when I make this and have had several people ask me if I added gluten because it doesn't crumble and is very moist. I have found that most bread recipes are great right out of the oven but are crumbly and dry the next day, but this one stays good for about a week and a half before it starts to get a little dry. Love, love it :)

Very easy recipe with solid results.  I did how ever lower the sugar to 1/4 cup, and increased the sales by a 1/2 teaspoon.  Also 15 minutes before I took my bread out I did an egg wash with a whole egg and a splash of water for color and a more firm crust.  Just my preference.  You could just as easily do a butter wash after it is done baking.

Best white bread recipe ever! I am still pretty novice at making bread and this recipe turned out perfect. Taste sweet but not overly. Great for an every day bread. Browned great, soft crust (I rise and bake with a cup of water in the over next to bread), didn't tear when spreading cold butter. I followed the recipe exactly except I made it in my KA mixer.

This was my first time baking bread and I'm no longer scared!! This bread has an amazing flavor!! I did do as suggested and decrease the sugar to 1/3 c. and I used olive oil and all purpose flour, as that was all I had! My picky little nephew even loved it!! I won't be looking any further for the perfect white bread recipe!! I don't know if I'll be able to eat store bought bread ever again!! I also used my Kitchen Aid Mixer...this bread was a snap to make!! No one in our family is complaining!! Thanks for a great and easy recipe!!

BEST WHITE BREAD EVER!  I made this bread last night, and the approval was unanimous.  It is easy and fast to make, and like someone else said "very forgiving". I used 1/4 cup of sugar and 3 tbsps. oil, and did not change anything else. It came out perfect. I got three 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 loaves. Thank you Peg for sharing this wonderful recipe.  -Elizabeth

This bread turned out great! Very soft and flavourful, with a nice crust on the outside (not too chewy). I did, however make a few simple modifications. First off, I read all the other reviews about how it was too sweet, so I used only 1/3c plus 2 tablespoons of sugar. Perfect sweetness! I also used potato water (water left after boiling potatoes) instead of regular water. I used regular all purpose flour which worked just fine (maybe better if you like a softer bread). And I turned them into large buns baking at 27 minutes. I also brushed them with egg wash (an egg beaten with a tablespoon of water). Couldn't be happier with it!!

Edit: I added an egg to the dough and made it into my own cinnamon rolls :) mmmm!

Edit number two: I also tried this recipe with half whole wheat and half AP flour and it was wonderful!

Oh my gosh...yes. I didn't quite use all 6 cups of flour- next time I will probably only use 5 cups so I don't waist the excess. But wow this was GOOD bread! Will make every week :) I wouldn't really say it's "Easy" as I spent a good amount of time kneading (which is ok because I LOVE kneading) but if you are looking for a recipe that does not involve a lot of kneading, this isn't the one. But worth every drop of sweat!!

This bread is simply the best bread I have ever eaten.  I used a kitchen aid mixer with a dough hook, slowly adding the flour.  Raised perfectly.  I reduced sugar, but would use full sugar if Making buns or raisin bread.  I used pampered chef stone pans which are amazing, and buttered top if crust immediately upon removing from oven.  Makes 2 huge loaves!

This is the first time I have ever baked bread by myself. This recipe was super easy and super yummy. After reading some of the comments I decided to cut the sugar down to only 1/4 cup. Also, I used regular 'ole all purpose flour instead of bread flour (I've never heard of such a thing). The bread came out light and fluffy. Super delish! I'll be making this bread from now on. ;-)

Very easy. Tastes great. Similar to a Hawaiian Roll but better texture. A+

Update: This works really, really well for cinnamon rolls. Way better than messing around with warm milk and all.

Easy and delicious! I am not a baker and this bread has turned out perfectly all 3 times : ) I use a little bit less sugar to suit my family's tastes. I usually make one loaf and turn the rest into buns. Thank you for the recipe!

First time making bread and this one sounded easy and tasty, so I gave it a try. It took a little longer for the second rise to happen, but the end result... SO GOOD! I'm very happy and proud of my bread, thank you!!

Tasty but the first time I made it I put in 6 cups of flour. The second time I only put 5 cups of flour and add a pinch here and there as I kneaded. That took away the floury taste. But, either way super tasty!!!

i have used a recipe like this for years..  evertime i try to cut the sugar, my family throws a fit... I have found that to cut down on how dense it can be, i add a little extra yeast and allow it to rise a little longer. This works perfectly.... 
It make excelent morning toast...

Yum yum yum!! I have tried so many bread recipes and this one is the best so far. I am definitely making this bread every week. My kids loved it!! I added all the sugar but next time I will add less. We love hawaiian bread and this bread tastes just like it!! I let it rise for an hour instead of 30 minutes the second time and i placed a pan in the bottom of the oven before I turned it on. Once it was preheated I added 5 ice cubes, the steam helps you get a brown crust.

I just don't like breads that contain too much sugar. It's too sweet to me. I'll stick with regular white breads. I believe adding excessive sugar doesn't make things delicious, rather opposite. This recipe is one of the proof of my belief.

I love this bread. Going to make it today. I make this with the baby. Fun and it was so simple and delicious that you can pop it in your mouth with nothing on it! On the sweeter side (not harsh) and goes with anything. If you do not really like that sweeter bread id reduce it just a bit.

I have made MANY bread recipes having worked in bakeries for many years. I'm a stay-at-home-mom now and was looking for a straightforward bread for my family to enjoy on a daily basis (mostly for sandwiches). I wanted no fuss, no muss, and no expensive ingredients. I found this recipe and it's a WINNER!!! Super easy to prepare with a stand mixer. Consistent results each time. And easily modified to lower the sugar content (I half the sugar, and cook a little less then stated). Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!! 
** P.S. If we have family coming over and I'm planning on making bread I HAVE to make at least a double batch because they all want a loaf to take home.

Absolutely perfect!  This is the first time I have made white bread and I found a winner! The recipe was fail proof for me - it rose perfectly and baked in the exact time of the recipe. I used rapid rise yeast because that is wheat I had in the house. I actually added the yeast to the sugar and then added the water.  I was afraid the water would cool down too much if I mixed the sugar and water first.  I ended up using not quite - 5-1/2 cups of flour to get to the correct consistency.  I have a hard time distinguishing what sounds like "hollow" to check for doneness, so, I just checked it with an instant read thermometer.  I took out about 190 (based on what I read on the King Arthur flour site) and it rose to about 198 degrees.  I will definitely be making this again! UPDATE:  7/17/17 Do yourself a favor and make this bread!  It is wonderful!  It reminds me of Hawaiin rolls, but, not quite as sweet.

I love this recipe, and after adjusting the sugar, have three variations I use: the original is great for sweet rolls, 1/3-1/2c is good for toast-and-jam uses, and 1/3c with 1c wheat flour replacing 1c bread flour is excellent sandwich bread.

I've made this several times. It has consistently turned out great. I love the fact that it makes 2 loaves so I can have one and give warm slices to my neighbors all around. I must say, they are very happy to see me walking up the drive with my tin foiled gift. Great and easy recipe. I recommend 100%

I just tried this recipe and followed "breadguy's" instructions. worked perfectly. putting the bread in the oven to rise works wonders. This is the fluffiest bread I have ever made. It is very sweet, which I like but I might try making it with less sugar next time as the sweetness doesn't work with all sandwiches. The person who posted saying it was dense probably didn't let it rise enough on the second rise or had a draft. I have been struggling with making bread for years and I finally  started doing a proper second rise and the dense bread is no more! Good luck

This is a good base bread recipe, but I change it for my purposes.  I prefer wheat for nutritional purposes, so I do 3/4th of the flour as whole wheat flour and 1/4th of it white just to give some levity to the bread.  I also only use 1/3 cup of flour, unless I intend to use the dough for something sweet, like cinnamon rolls, then I'll do closer to the amount the recipe calls for.  I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also add pure gluten to make up for the fact that I don't use bread flour (which has a higher gluten content, so I prefer just to keep regular flour and add gluten when needed).  I also add a little dough conditioner.  I made this without the gluten and dough conditioner, and it was still good, but those two things make it rise far more and make it more soft, airy and less likely to dry-out.  Definitely worth adding to it!!!   Makes for a delicious bread, which I make each Sunday to last us through the week.  :)

This was my first time making bread without using the bread machine. It was so easy to make and tastes really good too. It is a bit sweet for sandwich bread but makes a great piece of toast with honey butter. I will be making this again.

I love the simplicity of this recipe and the results are typically good.  The bread taste great and it's super easy to make.  With that said, I do sometimes have issues getting my yeast to proof.  Sometimes it will a little, sometimes not at all, sometimes like magic it proofs great and the dough rises really well.  Not sure why I get such inconsistencies.  I use good yeast and always make sure my temp is just right.  I know this is not the fault of the recipe, but just thought I would share my experience making this bread.  Good luck and enjoy.

Very easy, next time I am going to try reducing the sugar. Instead of white sugar I used turbinado sugar and olive oil instead of veggie oil. Turned out great!:)

I'm not one for writing reviews but I have been making bread for years. And apparently I've been making the wrong kind. This is an amazing recipe. I have tried them all but this one was a keeper. I proofed my yeast first as I usually do. I then rolled the dough and rolled it up as if I were making cinnamon bread. I actually made cinnamon bread out of one of the loaves. It didn't last until the next day. Try this one you won't be dissapointed.

My very first time making bread was an astonishing success! Because I was afraid of wasting ingredients - in case I messed this up - I scaled the recipe down to make only one loaf, which I would suggest if it's your first time, too. (**Notes for first timers: My first rise took quite a while because my house was so cold. It ended up taking half the day to rise until I finally decided to put it near something warm. That did the trick! So don't give up if yours doesn't rise - consider moving it somewhere warmer. Also, kneading the dough after that first rise, man, I was convinced I was going to get a brick! I kneaded it for a while, trying to make it "soft" because when I took it out of the bowl and kneaded it "a bit," it was a very heavy, small and non-stretchy ball of dough! I let it rise the second time for more than 30 minutes near a warm spot again, praying it would rise that 1" AND IT DID! And it was so delicious! So don't give up in case you have problems like me!**) After reading suggestions to cut the sugar down for a more "traditional" white bread taste,  I found it was still a tad sweeter than normal white bread, BUT I am way more excited to try it with the full sugar amount since now I know it'll probably taste exactly like Hawaiian bread!!! Since my oven runs hot, I only had to bake it 25 minutes. Excellent recipe, will not stray from it in case my bread making mojo gets squashed by another recipe!

Loved it! I replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat flour, cut the sugar down to slightly less than 1/2 a cup and let it rise for 1.5 hours first and an hour in the loaf pans. Slightly less sweet and much fluffier! Love this recipe!

I am a retired police officer - and although I am a female - I am NOT even close to the very worse baker in the world (I am so much more below that title :)  I came home to live and help my aging mother who loves homemade bread.  I was less-than-eager to attempt it.  Thank you Peg for this remarkably easy and YUMMY recipe!  I started it last week and have since made 6 loaves.  I'll be baking more over this cold snap of Northern Minnesota (at a whopping 50 below zero) - and the smell of your Amish White Bread makes our cabin fever a lot more bearable!

Easiest bread I've ever made! I don't own a bread maker and the texture was perfect. If you've never baked before you'll have success if you follow the recipe as is. One tip, if you're baking in the colder months, turn your oven on and place the dough on top or near it for the warmth. It helps the dough rise.

My first time making a somewhat successful bread. I was happy with it except for the fact that it was a little dense. I don't know if I needed to knead it more or what. Overall, I will try this recipe again.

I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose flour, perhaps thats why it came out a bit dense.  Its still very edible.  I reduced the sugar after reading reviewers saying how sweet it was.  I liked it and will try again with bread flour.

With so many 5 star ratings I have to think it's just me. I guess I like a more sturdy bread. If you like light and fluffy, this is tasty and easy. I did cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup.

This bread is wonderful! It's the perfect sandwich bread for our little family. I have even subbed a couple of cups of whole wheat flour and a 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten with great results!

Versatile is certainly the right word for this bread! I've made it with bread flour, white flour, and half whole wheat flour/half white flour. I let it cool in the pan for about 10 min. before turning the bread out onto a large plate and rubbing a thin coat of butter all over the crust. I like to make 1 loaf regular Amish Bread and the other loaf Raisin Amish Bread. To do so, follow step #1 as normal. For step #2, stir in the salt, oil, and 1c. flour. Divide between 2 bowls. To the 1st bowl (regular dough), add 2 1/2c. flour. For the 2nd bowl, add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. white sugar, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg, 1/3-1/2 c. raisins; stir, then mix in 2 1/2 c. flour. Knead each dough separately, and allow to rise in 2 well-oiled bowls. Follow remaining steps as original recipe.

Since I found this recipe two months ago, I make it once a week. I make dinner rolls not loaves.I also use the dough to make pizza and cinnamon rolls. One reviewer said it makes dense bread but mine is soft and fluffy. I use the rapid rise active yeast. This recipe was fail safe for me and its the best bread ever! (I cut sugar back to 1/3 cup instead of 2/3 cup unless Im making cinnamon rolls)..

I made this bread again today, the first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated but it was a little to sweet.  I changed up a few things  I cut back on the sugar to a 1/2 cup as per previous reviewers.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also used 2 cups of warm milk instead of water. This bread turned out wonderful it rose beautiful and tasted even better.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is almost exactly how my grandmother made it, with almost the same comments about the eggs, and powdered anything.  She always used lard, so I use Crisco but that seems the only difference.  Well, I think she used more yeast, but she called for cake yeast and it may need more for the umph factor.   Thanks for a slightly different version, I will have to try it.

Absolutely delicious!  Do be sure to cut the sugar in half or it will be too sweet for regular loaf bread.  Other than that, this is a definite 5-star recipe.  It would also be a good recipe for cinnamon buns, and in that case I would use the full amount of sugar recommended.

This bread turned out great! I don't like my bread sweet, but still wanted the flavor.... so I added a little less than half a cup of sugar. Perfect texture, wonderful taste! Just plain fabulous! Will have to try this again for cinnamon buns! Yum!

A really good, basic bread recipe. I made this and baked one loaf right away but stored the dough in the refrigerator and made the second loaf 3 days later. I will say that I liked the second loaf better because it wasn't as sweet. I guess the yeast ate up more of the sugar while the dough was sitting.
However, even the first loaf was very good. I'm just not a sweet tooth type of person and prefer the other way. So, I am making the recipe again today but will wait to bake it for a few days.

I have been making this one for years and used it in many different ways. One thing that has been bugging me about it, though, is that it's really crumbly and dries out quickly. It's dense and not flaky in a good way. I want something more fluffy that melts in my mouth. It uses minimal ingredients, which I like, but I'm left longing and on the hunt for another easy delicious recipe. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.

Best and easiest bread recipe I have found! My family ask me to make loaves of this bread at least two to three times a week. My first successful bread experience!

My family loved this bread. We had been looking for the perfect white bread for us and this is it. I can now say that I am officially done with buying bread from the store. The first time I made it it came out perfect, there was no air pockets and not to much crumb. I have made it both by exact recipe and with the lesser sugar and we like both.

I've been making this bread for years and have made over 200 loaves! Everyone loves it! Adjust sugar to taste. If you use suggested amount the taste is similar to Hawaiian bread. 

If you do not want to kill your yeast follow these helpful tips: make sure your water is between 105*-110* if it is 120* and above it will kill the yeast. Salt and yeast do not get along! Salt kills yeast. Do not add the salt until after you mix in 1 cup of flour. 

If using a Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook use stir setting until all flour is added then bump it up to 2 until dough is smooth. Do not go higher than 2!

This was amazing.  I used my stand mixer to knead the dough.  It turned out perfectly done after 30 mins, soft to the touch and professional!  Use PAM with flour for baking spray and the loaves fall out easily!

I love this recipe. The bread is light, fluffy and soft! I used 5 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of whole grain flour and instead of 3/4 cups of sugar, I used 1/4. Also, I used butter instead of oil. This bread tastes better than any store bought bread I have tried. Thank you for posting!

i made this bread, exactly as it was written and it was great.  i made a second time using a starter i keep for another bread recipe with dried porcini mushrooms, and some dried tomatoes and chives, i now  use this recipe in place of my other recipe  the sweetness of this bread really brought together the rest of ingredients. thank you for this wonderfully simple recipe that is so adaptable.

I only made one loaf of bread just in case it didn't turn out or it I didn't like it.  After reading the reviews I reduced the sugar by half and also allowed the dough to rise in the loaf pan for one hour. It turned out perfectly. My husband is very particular about his bread and he just loved this recipe. I will continue making this in the future.

I followed Breadguy's instructions for using a KA mixer and it turned out great!  Very easy, rose beautifully and tasted great- the whole family loved it.  In my opinion, the taste isn't quite as good as some other bread recipes I've tried, but it's still delicious and definitely one I'll make again. Our family is trying to eat less animal products, so I appreciate that this recipe doesn't call for milk or eggs.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Was the first time I made bread, still getting the hang of it but the taste was superb and I froze the second loaf to use for sandwiches as mentioned in some of the comments I had read. I will never need to buy bread again as this bred is perfect for sandwiches, breakfast and the like. Cut down the sugar somewhat to avoid having be too sweet, but my friend toasted himself a loaf and he gave it a two thumbs way up!

This was very good! I followed the instructions exactly, and while it wasn't exactly EASY, it went well for my first ever venture into homemade bread. And the finished product was tasty, however dense, and I probably will decrease the sugar a bit next time around. Overall a great outcome, and they made great Mother's Day gifts today!

Very easy bread recipe.  I make bread all the time for my six young children, and this is always my base recipe.  Usually I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup unless making a sweet bread (like cinnamon swirl).  This is truly awesome bread.  A tip to make it stay softer longer is to add 2 TSBP of dry potato flakes to the dough; and lightly butter the top of the bread when you pull it out of the oven for a silky crust.

This recipe has been a big hit every time I have made it. It is especially tasty coming straight out of the oven when it is warm and moist. I suggest leaving it in the oven for 35-40 minutes, not 30. This might just be personal preference, but I find that taking it out at 30 minutes, as suggested in the recipe, was not enough. 

HAVE GREAT YEAST... and if you don't, dissolve it in slightly warmer water, as well as let it rise longer and in a warm, dark place. 
 
This bread is very sweet, which works for my taste buds but not my waistline!

It is quite dense, but nonetheless: amazing.  It is great if you are on a budget as well, and can be done in using one bowl and a 9x5 inch pan. Yay for less dishes! I did not have to knead it on the surface, finding it easier (and a lot less messy) to knead in the bowl. 

It is extremely versatile: a great white bread base.

This might be the lightest, sweetest loaf bread I've ever made.  I followed the instructions except for the rising time.  It took 2 hours for the first rise, and that was by forced proofing.  After placing the dough in the loaf pans I force proofed the dough again for  80 minutes, until the dough was 1" over the top edge of the pan.  It baked in 20 minutes at 350°F.  (Forced proofing is done by placing the dough in it's bowl/pan in a hot (110-120°F) water bath.  The water should only be deep enough to submerge the bottom 1/2 of the bowl/pan).

Delicious bread!  Soft, but nice and substantial.  But I do agree with the majority of reviewers that it is a bit too sweet.  I reduced to 1/4 cup, but the bread tasted a bit too "yeasty".  Increasing to 1/2 cup made it too sweet, so I think I'll try 1/3 cup next time.  Makes lovely sandwiches, toast--anything you could think of making with ordinary white bread!  Thanks for the recipe!  If you're using the individual packets of yeast, use one packet per loaf, or two packets for the whole recipe.

Excellent! I cook/bake a lot, but for some reason, baking bread always seemed a bit intimidating.  I decided to try this recipe since it was reviewed so highly and seemed to give good, step by step instructions.  It was great! I've made it about five times now, and I've stopped buying bread at the store! The only thing I changed was to scale the sugar back to about 4 Tbs.

I made this last night... It came out so delicious! I halved the recipe cause i only have one bread pan. I used 1/4 cup of sugar and thought it could use a bit more. Also i used 1tbsp of salt. My house was cold so it took 2-3 hours to fully rise and then another hour to rise in the bread pan. It was a great midnight snack. My kids enjoyed it lightly toasted with cinnamon honey butter for breakfast this morning.

I have never made bread before because it seemed intimidating to me. I tried this recipe (cut it in half - only have one bread pan) and now I feel like a bread-making pro! I used regular AP flour and it turned out PERFECT. Seriously perfect. It made my apartment smell wonderful. What a great introduction recipe for aspiring bread bakers!

I can bake great cookies, but I have always been terrible at baking bread--even when I had a bread machine. It would always come out dense and doughy with a big air bubble at the top. In fact, I haven't even tried for years, but decided to try one more time and I am so thrilled to find a recipe even I can make! I made it exactly like the recipe except that I took other reviewers recommendations to cut back on the sugar. I used about a third of a cup and probably could have gone down to 1/4 cup. (It was still slightly sweet). 

It baked up light but with a good texture. It was great with just butter on it, but this morning I toasted a few slices and topped with butter and cinnamon. It was fantastic! I can't believe I actually made that loaf of bread.

Quite liked this recipe, but as other people have mentioned, it's VERY sweet. If I make it again I'll probably cut back on the sugar, because it's verging on cakelike sweetness. Too desserty to use in sandwiches, or with more savory spreads. Tasted good with butter, but not cheese.

I made them into rolls. Also made a regular loaf. Good recipe. I used organic raw sugar. Much better flavor. Also I found that if you proof it. Then punch it and proof again, it's not as dense.

My Wife hates me!!! I tried this recipe and it came out great but unfortunately, i did it without her help. the bread is soft and sweet and tastes really good on its own. i took pictures of the several stages and she reminded me how i never took pictures of her meals. after tasting my bread she changed her mind, she had it by itself and with a little honey and she absolutely loved it. I'm happy to say that she loves me again. great recipe

i have made this recipe every week for years. but today i made orange rolls out of it and it was amazing. i rolled it out, added butter, orange marmalade, a litle brown sugar, and fresh nutmeg. rolled and cut and they melted in your mouth.  of all the recipes out there, this one is the best!!!
if its too dense, you are adding too much flour. i use 4cups with a dash more when divide into 2 loaves.  it will look very sticky but will turn out very light.  if its too sweet use half the sugar.

I loooooooove this recipe.  The bread is fluffy and soft.  I reduce the sugar down to 1/4 cup, but I use the full 2/3cup of sugar when I make dinner rolls to make them more like Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. I love these!

I just started making bread last weekend and this was the 2nd recipe I tried.  I really liked the flavour of this bread and it reminds me a lot of the bread my grandma made.  I asked my family and friends to tell me which one of the two different recipes they preferred, and no one could really answer that.  However, a few did say they thought they preferred this one.  I ate it with butter, toasted, in a sandwich and used it for a grilled cheese and in the end I 'think' I prefer the other recipe (Traditional White Bread from this site).  The ONLY thing that tipped the scale, and only very slightly, was that it didn't seem to hold a sandwich together, grilled or otherwise; I found the sandwich fell apart, and no, I didn't slice the bread too thin.  I still gave it 5 stars as I don't think it would be fair to give it less until I make both recipes a couple more times, just to compare them a bit more.  Will definitely be keeping this one on hand.

This bread is super easy and always turns out! I always cut back on sugar by about 1/2, but that is my preference. Even with the normal amount of sugar, it is delicious!, I have made this into loaves, rolls, and bread bowls for salads(I have some on counter  right now that I am making into bread bowls for pasta) thanks for this amazing recipe!

Excellent recipe but heed Breadguy's advice if you use a Kitchen Aid mixer.  I learned that it isn't necessary to preheat your oven when making bread, whatever the recipe - honest!  That will be appreciated more in the summer.  This is my second try and I threw in an egg to keep it fresher longer.  This is a gorgeous loaf no matter what you use it for (husband is chomping on a turkey and havarti sandwich) and makes marvelous cinnamon rolls! (remember, tho, de gustibus non est disputandum  - there's no (point in) arguing about matters of taste.  An alternate but equally valid interpretation is 'if you don't agree with me, you have no taste.'(joke))

Really tasty bread.  I now started using 1/3 whole wheat and 2/3 cups white bread flour. I use just a bit less than 6 cups of flour...and I use my kitchenaid mixer to help knead.  Rises beautifully.  It always gets raided first thing out of the oven!!

I got a new Kitchenaid stand mixer for Christmas and was looking for a good, basic bread recipe to make in it.  This bread was PERFECT!  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, but followed the recipe exactly for everything else.  This bread was light and delicious!  A perfect sandwich loaf but just as good for tearing off a big hunk and dipping it in some yummy soup.  I made it two days ago and just used two slices to make the very best grilled cheese I have ever had!  I will make this over and over again!

I halved the sugar, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added 2 eggs, and 1/2 c. powdered milk when I have it. Oh, I used brown sugar instead of white.

Easy and delicious.  Four of us just devoured a loaf in minutes. Need I say more? (I let the loaves rise *very* high so it was super light and fluffy.  Cut back on the sugar a tiny bit too. Seems like it would make great French toast....l

This is my first time making bread from scratch. This recipe is great if you follow instructions to the t. My yeast was a 3 pack, i used 2. I thought I would  it up because I usualy do but it turned out soft with a flakey crust. Not too sweet at all. Made homemade butter with heavy whipping creme and a glass jar, spread it on. Yummy!

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour in this recipe and it is OUTSTANDING, if you like a dense bread, tastes like homemade bread should - I will make this again, maybe rolling up some cinnamon sugar for a cinnamon roll - so glad to have found this one, very easy to make and add on to

I'm from Amish country and this bread tastes exactly like the bread and buns we used to get from our small town bakery. Watch the baking time, my loaves were well done at 25 minutes. I plan to make this again for Christmas dinner.

So easy; this was probably the easiest bread I've ever made (and I've made a bit!). The second rise took almost three times as long, but I waited for it anyways; definitely worth it because the loaves didn't rise much in the oven. The loaves are sweet, but not overly-sweet, and it'll be perfect for breakfast and dinner.

I did do ONE THING differently but it had nothing to do with the mix; I put a cookie sheet on the bottom rack in the oven while it preheated and right when I put the dough in, I threw 4 ice cubes down real quick and closed the door. The added steam really hardened up the crust nicely, making this SUPER easy to slice. I recommend it if you like crusty breads!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!! Decreased the sugar just a smidge, down to about a half cup, and used AP flour as that's all I had on hand. Otherwise, i followed the recipe to a T. Turned out amazingly well! Light and fluffy and tender. Don't hesitate to try this simple and delicious recipe!

I really enjoyed this bread, it's the perfect sandwich loaf.  It was a breeze to make following the directions and the results are really good.  The only thing I did was to cut down the sugar to 2 1/2 Tablespoons as I don't like a lot of sugar in my bread, just enough for the yeast to eat.

This was my first EVER attempt at making home-made bread, and even with two little "helpers" (my three year old and eighteen month old) it still turned out beautifully!  The crust was a lovely golden color, only slightly crunchy, and the inside was nice, dense (but not overly so) and slightly sweet.  A delicious, easy to follow recipe, even for a novice bread baker.

Awesome recipe!  I didn't have any veritable oil so I used EVOO instead.  It took significantly longer than half an hour for the loaf to rise in the bread pan but it was well worth the wait.  I will definitely repeat this recipe.

Love this bread, made it twice. I used all purpose flour for bread the 2nd time I made it. It came out good. Easy to make you can't go wrong just follow the direction.

I have made this recipe a couple of times, and cannot figure out why I don't make it more often!  I made it tonight with some chicken noodle soup.  The recipe made 2 nice sized loaves.  I do let it rise until it looks right...longer than what the recipe says...but I just keep checking on it.  When it is the height I want, I pop it in the oven.  It was great, and both loaves were devoured by 7 people at dinner.  Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  I tried it today and varied it a bit to suit my style of baking.  

I prefer weights to volume measures for flour.  So, I used 2 pounds (32 ounces) of flour.

I prefer butter to oil, so I used 1/2 stick of butter of melted and cooled butter instead of the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.

It baked in 32 minutes and had a beautiful, thin, light brown crust and a delicate crumb.

I tried a slice spread with butter and a slice toasted with butter.  They were delicious, but a tad sweeter than I prefer.  Then next time I bake this bread (soon), I'll drop the sugar to 1/2 cup and I may reduce the sugar further depending on the taste.

Lawdy, Miss Claudy!  I have been making my own white bread for years--a recipe I found in a cookbook back in the 70s. I swore by that recipe which really is very good, but THIS simple, basic Amish white bread recipe is without a doubt the greatest I have ever tasted! So easy, so forgiving... and so perfect!  I've already committed it to memory and am making it at least once a week.  Thank you so much, Peg!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe for white bread! I don't think you could go wrong with it, bu here are some tips! 1. Weight your flour instead of using cup measurements. It is more accurate. 2.lower the sugar for a fluffier and less sweet bread. 3. Rub shortening on your hand before you knead the dough, prevents it from sticking to your hand. 4.Make sure you use GOOD AND NEW YEAST. Thr first time i made the bread i use some left over old yeast and i came off really bad. I switched to SAF yeast and my bread came out wonderful.Also be patient and wait until the yeast misture is foamy and creamy. Trust me, it is worth the wait. 5. When i am in a hurry, i mix the dough first.put it in a oiled bowl cover with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge. After about 6 hours the dough rises beautifully! I punch it down then knead it for a few more minutes 6. I tried using all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and it works just fine. You might need a little more flour and the texture is slightly different. 7. Don't put too much oil in your tins, the dough will absorb it and prevent it from rising. 8. They make great buns! Just divide and shape them then bake for around 20 minutes. (try adding a tiny sausage in the middle!)  9. Brush butter on the baked bread to give them a great look and better taste.

Have made this recipe twice and it seems fool proof!  I took the advise of several, weighed the flour (762 grams), used 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tbsp yeast and used bread flour.  The dough raised FAST and the loaves raised FAST and I had beautiful tall, loaves of bread.  There was no heaviness or coarseness.  This bread is light as air and perfect for sandwiches... or warm with butter.  10 stars!!!

I tried this but changed it up a bit and although it was good, I wasn't satisfied with the way it turned out. I used 1 1/2 cups warm water and 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 1/3 cup sugar as suggested by other reviewers, and everything else the same. I will try it again the way it is written and see how it turns out, or use just regular plain old milk instead of evaporated. It was very dense and crumbly in my version. Either that or make the whole sugar and cinnamon version one other reviewer made. I still gave it 5 stars because it's not the poster's fault I screwed it up.

I'm not sure what I did wrong (proofed the dough, let it rise 1 inch above the loaf pan, etc), but it turned out like French bread - dense.

Thanks Peg.  Family crisis this month due to daily bread production halt; the machine broke.  Don't need one anymore, though!  I use 3tbsp sugar; 375deg for 30 mins.  Mornings are cold here near the water and 2nd rise takes 40-50 min unless I put it in the warmed oven. Dough seems to repay heavy kneading with a smooth pretty crust.  Tuck the edges down hard after punching into the pan and the top balloons perfectly.

I baked this today and I can't explain how perfect this came out and how delicious this was.  Very EASY to make. I made it just like the recipe.  I have tried to make bread several times and always failed, but this one is a WINNER and a KEEPER!

OMG This bread came out wonderful... Nice and soft.. I'm eating while I'm typing this review.... I did take the suggestions from other reviewers about reducing the amt of sugar so I used 1/3 cup and I used all purpose flour because that's what I had and still great especially since it was my 1st try at bread making. I will substitute the oil with melted butter next time though.Give this recipe a try this recipe guys even if you're a bread making newbie you won't regret it

I had never baked a bread before and this is the first one I tried and I am glad I did! It is dense, got that nice crunch on top and softness inside. My aunt called me to ask if I can make her another loaf! I just made 2 loaves right now and I put 2 tsps ground cinnamon (my family loves cinnamon) and a cup of raisins to the recipe. Let's see how long they'll last =)

When I made this bread, it turned out more dense and the crust was hard.  I don't know what to do to make it less dense and to make the crust softer, but other than that, it was really tasty!!

WONDERFUL and easy to make bread.  Since this was my first time making this I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My bread turned out perfect.  Great dense sweet loaf.  The next time I make this I will reduce the sugar a tad and see how that turns out.

Sooo good! The whole family loves this bread. As per an earlier suggestion, I let the dough rise a little longer and cut off some excess to make rolls. Perfect idea. This is definately a staple bread.

Easiest, best bread I have made.  I love that you have hardly any kneading and yet it turns out great.  I did what other people suggested and halved the sugar and it was plent sweet enough for our tastes.

I just tried this recipe today and I absolutely loved it! I always read some lower reviews along with the higher reviews just to get an overall feeling of what I should expect, and I think that helps. So if you're reading this, you're already on the right track. My mom tried it and went "Oh, my goodness, this is SO good." AND IT IS! It's not too dense and not too fluffy. I'm giving it four stars because I decided to use 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 and even with half the amount of sugar, my mom and sister said it was "sweet somehow". Maybe the original Amish White Bread is supposed to be sweet, I don't know. I suppose it is a matter of preference. ANYWAY, I will definitely be making this again in the future. Maybe I might try it with 2/3 cup of sugar if I'm feeling it.

This bread was all it claimed to be.  I loved it.  The inside was a little soft this first time but I only baked it for 25 mins in my gas oven.  I will leave it in a bit longer next time.  
I did not proof the yeast just mixed it into the sugar water and continued with the recipe.  The bread was soft and fluffy and delicious.  Best bread I have made yet!

Tastes wonderful and was easy to make. However, it kept falling apart onto itself as I was cutting it so I ended up with maybe 4 really good slices. Maybe I need to bake it a little longer? It was really soft and moist so I will try it again and bake it longer next time.

Delicious and pretty easy to make.  Very light, sweet and the softest bread I've ever had.  Have a batch in the oven now with some added ingredients including garlic, onion powder, Parmesan cheese, etc).  Can't wait for it to be done!

Used original recipe with BreadGuy's advice for proofing with a KitchenAid mixer. Thank you! Easy bread recipe. Came out crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. Hearty consistency. If you're looking for a light bread from the grocery shelf, this is not for you. Have made this twice. I took out a 2-month old frozen loaf yesterday, thawed and reheated it. It was still good though crust was not as crusty, other than that, no complaints. Take the time to make this, it's worth the effort!

I enjoyed the bread, but my husband said it lacked sweetness that he likes in bread. I will just add a little brown sugar next time.

I made this bread mostly because of all the great reviews; the masses did not lie. I can honestly say I like this better than store bought bread. I may consider reducing the sugar a tinge, but overall I highly recommend it. Had it for dinner two nights in a row. Love how filling it is and the sweetness only gets better as the days go by. Enjoy!

As the 2742nd person to review, I am sure I am not adding anything new, but have to say this is excellent, simple and no-fail. I have been trying bread recipes left and right, and this one is perfect to make each week instead of store bought. Your kids, neighbors and coworkers will look forward to Mondays!

Amazing! So simple and taste wonderful! Only thing I changed was using butter instead of oil and cutting sugar to 1/3 cup. It was PERFECT! I will now make our bread using this recipe.. Would be great made into dinner rolls! Thank you so much!

This bread is delicious. My husband has asked that we no longer buy store-bought bread and only have this at all times. I braid mine after it rises, add a little cinnamon/sugar and follow the instructions for baking time, turns out beautiful and I can give some to the neighbors as a gift!

Amazing recipe! The bread is moist and luscious, while the crust isn't too thick. The only adjustment I made was to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup.

This makes a beautiful, fine grained loaf of bread.  I did cut back the sugar to 1/2 cups as others have suggested.  Since I have kefir, I have been replacing about half the water with it and it cuts the sweetness just a little.

turned out great this recipe is a keeper, one of the best breads ive made in a long time, I converted it over for my bread machine to do all the mixing and for that I have a few warnings that I experienced 

most bread machines only hold a 2 lb loaf so what I had to do so this recipe wouldn't blow the top off during the proofing cut the flour down to 4 cups which is the max for a 2 lb loaf if yours only holds 1 lb loafs your gonna have to cut that in half 

after the machine is done in the dough cycle "after proofing and kneading" for mine thats a hour and a half take the dough out on a lightly floured surface and work in the rest of the flour "knead it very well" and this recipe makes two perfect loafs of bread, I egg washed the top of the loafs before baking and they came out with a nice shiny crust 

I highly recommend you do not cut the 30 min sit in loaf pan out after kneading the remaining cups this builds gluten and will reward you with light fluffy loafs of bread with a uncommon consistency you can not get in store bought bread

thank you for a great bread recipe

Yeah!!!  This is my second attempt at making bread and the first that worked!!!  I love it!!!!  I did decrease the salt because I subbed in real sweet cream, salted, butter for oil and was afraid of over salting but it could have used a the full prescribed amount.  So great though!!!!  If you have failed at others give this a try.

This was the first bread recipe I ever made that came out "better than store bought".

Since I first stumbled upon it, I've made it a few times. Sometimes I add extra sugar, or use half wheat flour, or an extract. No matter what, it always seems to come out beautifully.

My time is limited and do not have time to make bread by hand.  I thought I would just try this simple recipe in my bread machine!  It was perfect!  No changes. The settings were 1.5 lb loaf, light crust, and no additions.  Major raves from the breadaholics in my family.

This is one of my favorite every day bread recipes.  I make this a couple of times a week.  It is great toasted for sandwiches, or with margarine and a little cinnamon sugar for breakfast.

I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, as 3/4 is a bit too sweet for my taste.

This is a winning recipe.

First bread I ever made and it turned out so wonderful! It was perfectly fluffy and I reduced amount of sugar like said and it turned out sooo delicious! I also made a cinnamon and brown sugar one and it was just as good!

I am a pretty exerienced bread maker-I've tried several recipes and this is one of my all time favorites. I took one suggestion for a very minor alteration, I decreased the sugar becuase I didn't want it very sweet. I used 1/3 cup of sugar. The rise on this bread was perfect and very easy!! I made two loaves for a small gathering at my house and it was gone!

This bread is easy and delicious! I reduced the sugar to 2 Tbsp based on something another reviewer did. That way it wasn't very sweet which was perfect!

Very good bread!  I made my own modifications to make it much better for you.  But still incredibly good!  I use honey in place of the sugar, coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil and white winter wheat flour (looks like white flour but it is wheat. Same nutritional value as wheat...so good.  Try it!)

I used the 2 cups of flour called for (recipe split in half for one loaf, and flour lessened to original before the change), plus just another 1/4 C to get it just un-sticky enough to handle, turn a few times and get into the oily bowl for rise.  (*just made another loaf of this bread and had to sub 1/4 C gluten flour, turned out not as white, but great) I did the oven trick for rise that someone shared.  (*this time for warmth I set the dough to proof on my running dryer in the laundry room).  Well, this turned out to be the most perfect loaf of sandwich bread- very soft, yet with this gluteny durability I've been after.  (*my 2nd loaf even better than first- was running out of flour, so BARELY made the recipe, and resulting dough was BARELY handlable.  But it was just workable, and didn't take much working prior to first proof, and not much at 2nd.  When I got it out of pan after cooking, I thought it was liquid inside it was so soft, but it was not!  It turned out my best cooked loaf- no raw spots and not too dense in the least.  Light and strong.  I did not use bread flour, but unbleached AP, again.   One thing>> I will use much less sugar next time....it is too sweet for what I want.(I used half the sugar called for this time, and it was much better for us, not tangibly sweet). I really appreciate finding this posted recipe for white bread- it's a great one. SIMPLE- you're likely to have the ingredients on hand. Also added egg wash and poppy seed this time. Yum.

This bread was pretty good.  I've made it a few times now and have had to wait for quite a while for it to rise.  It's extremely dense which my husband and kids didn't care for and after about 2 pieces I was done.  I wouldn't use it for sandwiches, but it did taste good with apple butter.  One piece of bread filled me up enough that it was basically a whole sandwich.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday.  We just love it....my husband says it reminds him of the rolls we used to get at one of our favorite restaurants that went out of business years ago.  I am so very happy to find this recipe and am now in the process of making a second batch of loaves today...hopefully it will freeze well because this is going to be my go to recipe for every loaf/roll I make in the near future.

This bread was so easy to make. Mine took a little bit longer to rise. I actually sat it on a wire shelf about a foot above a heater vent. I got 2 great looking loaves that tasted just as delicious. My 10 year old son asked me to stop buying bread at the store and just make this.

Ridiculous how good this bread came out!! Made it yesterday, and I can guarantee it will be gone after lunch today! The one I've been making is perfect for toast and such, but this one is absolutely perfect for sandwiches, buttered bread, etc...The only adjustment I made was cutting the sugar in 1/2 (to 1/3 of a cup), and it was plenty. Any more would have been too sweet for sandwich bread. And I used the K.A. to kneed it on setting 1 for 5 minutes. The bread came out awsome!

This bread is a bit sweet and super delicious! I love it! Easy too, if let the mixer (like kitchen aid) do the kneading, actual work time is like 15 minutes. The rest of the time is letting the yeast do the work and cook time too.

Wow!  This bread is amazing!  I made it exactly as written except I halved the recipe and used my Kitchenaid mixer.  Thanks for the mixer instructions submitted by other reviewers.  My second rise took a little over an hour.  30 minuted in the oven, and it came out perfect!  So moist and fluffy and light.  The sweetness complimented the savory bean stew I served it with.  Didn't even need butter, it is so good.  It's comes out sweet as written, but not cake sweet.  I will try other's suggestions and make it with less sugar to use as a sandwich bread.  Thanks for the recipe, Peg, it is a real winner.  And gave me some confidence to experiment further with bread making.  LOVE!

I have been making htis bread for years now, it is so easy and super yummy, I only use 1/3 cup sugar.  ANd I don't worry so much about "proofing" the yeast...I do use really warm water and then sugar stir and then add the yeast and stir...it always comes out fine!  Enjoy!  You can also use this for pizza crust, hot pockets, cinnamon bread, or roll flat and fill with lunch meat and cheese and roll up and bake for a finger food

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  I bake bread for my family at least twice a week.  My kids and husband love this recipe.  This is a keeper.  My only changes were the amount of sugar (3 tablespoons) and I use butter instead of oil.

Don't know that it's worthwhile writing another review, but I did want to add my voice to the general acclaim. I've made many a loaf of bread, from may many different recipes, but love this one for it's simplicity and almost foolproofness. Like some I find it a little sweet, and half the sugar. 

It hasn't failed me once. Soft, dense, and keeps it's flavor and texture even a day or two later.

This bread was good but lacking a little flavor. Would add more salt or sugar next time.

I had never baked bread from scratch before, so when I tried this recipe-it is perfect for those just starting out with breads.  So simple to work with and ends with great flavor!

I live at a high altitude so was skeptical, but the bread turned out wonderful!  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and may reduce it a little more with the next batch.  Other than that I made no changes. I also have a milk allergy, so it was nice to find a good bread recipe without dairy.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a very easy and great recipe.  My family loves fresh home made bread.  Just do not try to double this recipe if you do not have a big enough bowl for this to rise in.  It made a mess, but still turned out delicious.  Thanks

Making bread is something I don't often do because what I make can hardly be called bread. It usually looks more like a doorstop. Anyway, this recipe looked easy enough so I gave it a shot and what do you know-it turned out beautifully. This recipe is a keeper for sure. My family loves it when I use this bread to make French toast. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks and I suspect I will be taking requests for this bread for a long time. :)

This was the second loaf of bread I had ever made.  I ate 3 HUGE slices before I made myself stop.  No longer intimidated by flour and baking, this bread was a joy to make, light, fluffy and delicious.  I did reduce the amount of sugar and used turbinado suger instead of white, but this suited my tastes just fine.  So happy with my bread venture.

This is fantastic!  Easy to make, sweet and yeasty heavy bread.  It is great to serve with or before any meal.  After mixing the dough, for whatever reason- maybe too cool in my house, my dough did not want to rise but you can put it in the oven covered on warm or with the oven door cracked to help it rise.  At any rate it turned out to be a good heavy sweet yeasty bread great for sandwiches or a side to any meal.  It is easy and cheap enough to make that it's worth it to make once a week and not have to buy bread at the store!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

All I can say is "WOW"!!!! This was my first attempt at making bread and made it from scratch. No bread machine. I was so excited that it turned out perfect, I kept saying....I can't believe I actually made bread!!! I did use less sugar, 1/3 c and it was perfect. I made one loaf of bread and also buns. The buns when you bite into them, fluff right back up. Amazing. I will be making my own bread from now on. My DH wants me to make some more today!

The best and easiest bread recipe I ever used.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. I love the denseness and texture.  It  doesn't smuch when I cut it.

Using half the sugar called for in the recipe, this has quickly become my "go to" recipe for white bread.  I make it two or three times a week.  Love the crust, love the texture.  It slices well, toasts well, freezes well.  I no longer buy white bread in the store except for the occasional really, really good sale :-)

My absolute go-to bread recipe even in a recipe box overflowing with bread recipes! By simply following the steps you can't go wrong and this is quite possibly the most versatile and adaptable bread recipe on the entire site. 

I've made it just as written and gotten rave reviews and taken other's advice, dropped the sugar to around 1/4 cup, and had the same people raving again! The sugar content definitely makes all the difference in the world with more sugar equaling a denser bread. 

I've used this recipe to make everything from sweet breakfast breads to salty herb-filled Italian bread by tweaking the sugar and add-ins and just couldn't be happier with it either way.

Take the time to give this one a shot and you may just toss your other recipes - with this one, one is all you need!

I love this bread! I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but I cannot get that white fluffy store bought bread, but on the other hand, I really like this MUCH better. it's slightly sweet with a light chewiness, and fresh out of the oven I could eat a whole loaf! I've made this a few times, first following the recipe exactly and came out with a sweet-bread consistency, pretty dense and very buttery and sweet. I cut down the sugar to 1/2c for my second batch and had basically the same results, only having a slightly fluffier bread. Again I cut down the sugar (desperate for that "sandwich loaf") to 1/4c, and finally had a great loaf of bread. My husband and I ate an entire loaf within an hour out of the oven! It was still slightly sweet but definitely the best bread EVER.
KITCHENAID USERS: proof your yeast in the mixing bowl, then add your salt & oil. on speed 2, begin to add your flour 1/2-1c at a time. once you add about half and begin to get a ball on your hook, decrease to stir each time you add flour and only add 1/2c at a time (my mixer tossed flour everywhere at 1c on speed 2!) Once your happy with the consistency (i found this closer to 5c instead of the recipes 6c, mix on speed 2 for another 3-4 minutes, remove from your hook and HAND KNEAD for another minute or two. It gives the bread that hand kneaded love and helped me shape it out for a nice pretty loaf in the pan.
Hands down, this is a great loaf of bread! Definitely a keeper!

soooo good!  I have tried to make bread from scratch a few times but it always ends up too dense.  This was perfect!  I did have to let it rise in the pan for an extra 30 minutes, but it was well worth it.  Thank you Peg!

Excellent bread, I used all purpose flour, made the dough in my breadmaker then followed instructions as written. Thank you so much Peg! I'm going to try cinnamon raisin bread, and dinner rolls with this dough as well.

Fast becoming a favorite go-to recipe.  It's quick (for yeast bread) and delicious.  I also like that it makes more than one loaf.

I had to use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but it still turned out great. I added a little extra yeast. Soft and fluffy inside with crisp outside.

Easy recipe to make and change.  I halved the recipe just incase I ruined the bread.  I even risked it by making it wholesome by adding wheat flour and ground flaxseed.  I did increase the water by 1/2 cup to compensate for the flaxseed. I let it rise 1 1/2 hrs, then another 30 mins in the pan. Put it in a 425 oven for 5 mins then reduced temp to 350 and baked for 35 mins. It turned out delicous! Will definitely keep making this recipe. Next I will try  a cinnamon raisin version. YUM!

Fantastic Bread! When I found this recipe I had no idea how A) it would turn out B) How easy it would be to make & C) How much my family would enjoy it. This recipe is now the DeFacto recipe we turn to when my family asks me to make more. Thank you for providing this. In my oven, I cook it about 37 minutes and it is perfect. 30 minutes was underdone in my oven.

Delicious! I made it using my bread machine. I cut the recipe in half, used the 1lb setting and added the liquids, solids, and then the yeast to the container.

As long as you proof the yeast properly this bread is awesome.  I did reduce the sugar to 3 TBSP and increased the salt by a smidgen.

I LOVE THIS BREAD!  I have always been very intimidated by bread because my mother has made bread and buns my entire life and she always just "did it" without a recipe.  So I made the dough with my KitchenAid mixer and used the tip about cutting the sugar (I only used 3TB) and it came out perfectly...I could not be happier.  Might try it with whole wheat next time...it's too easy not to whip another batch!

Wow!  I'm new to this whole bread baking and after 5or 6 recipes that were all dissapointing to some degree, I Made A Perfect Dough with this recipe!  I actually halved the recipe (In case I messed up again) and made 8 nice size hamburger buns which turned out BEAUTIFUL!  I am now making a loaf bread with this recipe - thank you, thank you , thank you for posting this "Kelley-proof" recipe!

I've made this bread as per the recipe and once with my own additions.  When made as per the recipe, the bread is great!  I took half a loaf with me to work with the intention of sharing, but liked it so much that I decided not to share.

The next time I made it, I followed the recipe for the most part, but added a cup of dried cranberries (didn't have any raisins) after the third cup of flour.  Once mixed and risen, I punched it down, kneaded it for a few minutes, cut in half and flattened out each half.  I sprinkled each half with cinnamon and rolled them up before putting them in the pan.  It turned out wonderfully!  My family loves it!

We have been searching for the perfect sandwich bread recipe for about a month.  We have finally found it!!!  Absolutely perfect (although we did cut the sugar amount in half as suggested by some reviewers).  I can't say enough about this recipe, going to pass it along many times :)

Easy enough for the novice baker, or somewhat distracted parent (such as myself, with toddler in tow). I did use all purpose flour, and still got a really nice, chewy crust. The bread itself is elastic enough to stand up to being buttered, or even spread with peanut butter.

This is great bread! I am often asked to "pretty please, make that bread!"  I sometimes add organic coconut oil and pineapple to this recipe to make a dessert bread.

I made this bread following the directions...next time I will use the tips but this is FLAT out the best one I have tried. 

The tip about putting a pan of warm water in the oven to help with the rise doesn't just help in the colder north but can help in the South when it's winter. I ran a pan of the hottest water I could to put in the pan underneath it and did not open the oven door til the hour was up. It works wonderfully.

Very tasty! Easy to make. Made 3 loaves this morning and we're only down to one loaf left! Only issue I had (and this likely my fault and not the recipe's) was that 5 cups of flour seemed easier to work with than 6. I used 6 and had quite a bit left over. Going to try with 5 or maybe 5 1/2 next time.

Wow - this bread is great!  Much lighter in texture than other white bread recipes I have tried.  I only used 3 tsp of sugar in the bread and it came out perfect to my taste - perhaps the Amish like their bread sweeter than I do!

I love this bread! Have made this several times, now. However, I have made some changes due to personal preferences. Lowered the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup... may end up lowering it even more. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 4 cups of unbleached flour. This last time, (today 12/8/11) I used virgin coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil. Bread was very good! We like a more dense bread, so this recipe fits our family to a tee! Thank you for sharing!

Wow this is perfect! Decrease sugar to your preference if it's too sweet; I decreased to 1/2 cup after the first batch and that's what works for me. Used unbleached white flour and turned out great, but better with bread flour... not as heavy in my stomach. This has replaced storebought bread for my family. I keep it fresh in a breadbox. If you don't it only lasts about a day, day and a half, but w/ breadbox, it lasts about 4 days, which is great for my family as the kids gobble it up. Once it starts to dry out a little it's still good for toast, french toast, homemade garlic bread, croutons... very versatile, best recipe I have ever made. Thanks for posting this!!!

I didn't last long once my hubby and kids got a taste!  I did follow a lot of the recommendations and reduced the sugar to about 3 tbsp so that it was more like sandwich bread than a sweet bread!

WOW this bread is soooo good! This was my first attempt at making my own bread and now my husband wants to buy me a pound of yeast (vs the little envelopes) so I can keep baking it :)) I did cut sugar in half as suggested by other reviews. I compete with my Mom's recipe now. Thank you. No fail, I think I'll slice some more

Great recipe! Thanks.
I used all purpose flour it was good. I did not use all the flour though (at first i lost count, then i thought i used too much LOL). I used also less sugar too 1/3 cup.
Did one loaf in bread tin and one on a flat sheet. I also brushed egg white.

This recipie was so easy and tastes fantastic. I cut the sugar back a little and only put 1/3 cup.  For me that was perfect. I actually used this recipie to make ham and cheese pockets. They were amazing.

This recipe was very easy and delicious. My yeast didn't really proof which worried me but it turned out fine. So no worries if it doesn't proof all the way. I cooked it for about 20min instead of 30 and it came out perfect.

So I'm just your average 32yo non married guy.  For some reason I've wanted to start baking stuff.  I don't know it just seems better than buying pre-made junk from the store.

This was the very first loaf of bread I've ever made form scratch.  The directions are great and it came together well.

I don't think it tasted that great but I can sup it up a bit next time.

I did let it stale a bit and tried making french toast with it and WOW that  was great!  So if you don't like how it turns out try making something else.

I make this bread once or twice a week with great results every time!  It's never failed.  I add the water, sugar and yeast to the pan in my bread machine and let it sit for about 10 minutes (until foamy), then add the rest of the ingredients and choose the dough setting.  When complete, I divide the dough in half, and shape into loaf pans for the final rising, then bake as directed.  Perfect every time.  Love this recipe!

This was a great recipe, just as it's written. It is very easy to do, even for someone who doesn't bake a lot.  I split the dough and made one loaf and some rolls. The loaf was nearly perfect, and sliced easily and neatly. The rolls were excellent. I will make this again. When I was a kid, I used to "help" my grandmother bake bread, and this was as close as I've come to recreating her wonderful loaves.

Very good bread! I usually use my bread machine to mix and rise dough, but did it all by hand with this bread. Absolutely easy and rewarding. I just had major surgery and was able to make this with no issues that is how easy it is! Just a note, I only ended up adding 5 cups of bread flour instead of 6. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. It took a little longer to rise after putting into the loaf pans but so far it looks fabulous! Going to do a cream wash on top to make it shiny and pretty before I bake it. Also made enough to make a little pumpkin shaped loaf for my kiddos since Halloween is on Monday!

I attempted this recipe twoce over the past two days.  The first time was with AP flour and the second with Bread flour.  There clearly was a difference between the two.  If possible use the bread flour.  While the flavor was great either way but the bread flour made it alot lighter.

I give this bread 5 stars. I have also tried it with butter instead of oil and it came out very nice. My children loved it. I made 4 loaves and my son ate at least half of it just as soon as it came out of the oven. My neighbors heard about it  it and that afternoon all the bread was gone!

My family loves this bread & begs me to make it whenever I can. It really is easy & delish!!! Roll it out & it makes perfect cinnamon rolls, pizza crust for scillian pizza, & it would make great buns for gourmet sandwiches.

Very good bread.  Made this in my bread machine on the dough cycle.   Used 1/3 cup sugar and 1 tbsp bread machine yeast.  After it was mixed I split it into two loaves and let rise for about an hour.  I'm making another batch right now and will make one loaf of bread and maybe some hot dog buns or hamburger buns or something.

BEST and easiest bread to make. I was out of money and bread, and had all the ingredients on hand to make this. I do not have much experience with making bread... but it turned out perfect. I presifted my flour, and also let it rise alot more before baking. The result was a perfect crust, and a super fluffy inside. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfecto!
I will be ditching the store bought bread for good. This is way too easy and cheap to to pass up. And my house smells fantastic. Thank you for posting.

this reciepe was soo simple and easy i love it and the taste from it is awesome my friends and nieghbours love the bread as well and the ease of it is nice it is bred making at it's simplest . tho i would suggest depending on how warm your house is to let the bread rise for roughly three hours plus would seriously recommend cutting the sugar back to half a cup. This reciepe is good for people who would rather forgo dragging out that old bread machine. And get back to the basics of baking and cooking.

Made this in my bread maker. I forgot halve the recipe though, so I have a mess on my hands!  Most of the bread is cooked through and tastes great. We will be making this again!!

Turned out great, even though I dumped all the flour in at once. The loaves did not rise very much before I put them in the oven, but once they were baked they looked great. I cut the sugar by half and it was still a little sweet.

I absoutly LOVE this recipe!!! I've never made homeade bread before, and wanted to give it a try. I came across this recipe and thought I would  try it since it only made two loaves. It came out perfect the first try and I've made it twice in two days. With the second batch I made a single loaf and turned the other half into the famous West Virgina pepperoni rolls. Yummy, I'm not sure I will ever make a diffrent recipe for homemade bread.

I just made this for the first time a few days ago and I am already making more. This is the first time I have ever made bread and my baking experience usually tuns into a disaster but this went better than amazing! I just followed the directions with no changes and my housemates and I devoured my first loaf as soon as it came out.

I made bread for the first time using this recipe and it turned out delicious. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and kneaded for 8-10 min, and the bread has just the right amount of sweetness and consistency.

This was my first time using this  recipie and it tastes better then any bakery bread.   This is officially my go to bread recipie.  I may even make another batch tonight because we have already finished the first loaf and it hasn't even cooled.  Thank you for a great recipie!!!!

My boyfriend and I love this bread.  The first time I made it, it was very good.  The only mistake I made (since I had never made bread before) was not covering the bread after splitting it into the loaf pans, so it did not rise as high as it should have.  It is delicious.

This is the only bread recipe I use. It works EVERY time and is perfect. I love the sweetness - not too much, not too little. I realise it isn't for everyone, but it's cheap and it works. Especially toasted with real salted butter...yum. I've never had a problem with this recipe. I do sometimes add powdered milk with this, too. Makes great rolls also.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'll never buy white bread again! I've tried it with the entire 2/3 cup sugar and then with 1/3 cup and it came out absolutely perfect both times. It took mine a bit longer to rise but I just let it sit until it got there (about 3 hrs). I also brushed butter over the tops when they came out of the oven - keeps them nice and soft.  Less sugar yielded a less dense bread, very close to the texture of store-bought white but so much better. Makes the best toast and grilled cheese sandwiches ever. Love it!

I make this bread on a regular schedule. It's a very good recipe. I've been known to give several loaves away so that others can enjoy it too.
*** I continue to make this bread. I can't imagine anyone not loving it. I have even been asked to make some so that others can buy it from me!

This bread was so easy and delicious.  The second time I made it, I added crushed rosemary, dill, and grated Parmesan to the liquid ingredients before adding the flour.  It was so delicious!  I am going to use it next to make cinnamon rolls!

This was my first attempt at baking bread and this recipe worked out wonderfully!  I did adjust the amount of sugar as other reviewers suggested and made 1 loaf by adjusting the serving size to 12 and reducing the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  The bread was so easy to make (I'm a beginner in the kitchen) and it tasted better than I imagined.  My husband and I had it with maple butter (whipped butter with maple syrup whipped in) and it was to so delicious. 

Did have one quick question for the group...for wheat bread, would it be sufficient to just replace the bread flour (I ended up using regular flour based on other reviewer's note and it worked out well) for wheat flour without adjusting the levels of any of the other ingredients?

If I could give this ten stars, I would. This bread is amazing, just a hint of sweet, a perfect crust and crumb. It also makes some amazing garlic Texas toast! Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious!  Made the dough in the bread maker, then put it into 2 bread pans, let rise again for a hour, then cooked in the oven.  Very light, fluffy, and tasty!

I'm not a very good direction-follower, but the deviations I took gave the recipe a little extra character. I activated the yeast about 30 minutes ahead of time using about 1/4 cup of water and some honey. I also cut back on the sugar and used an egg wash with some rolled oats 'cause... well... it's pretty. :) I really enjoy the simplicity and flavor of this recipe.  I've made this recipe about 3 times now and it only seems to get better.

This was delicious!  My entire family (full of picky eaters) loved this.  It has become a staple at my house.  When I make this, I cut the recipe in half and mixed the ingredients in the bread machine on dough cycle, punch down, transferred to a loaf pan, allowed to rise then baked in the oven.  I only wish my bread machine was bigger so I could make more at once.

A good, soft, loaf. Great for sandwiches, toast, etc. My kids loved it. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup but kept everything else the same. Glad it made 2 loaves, because 1 would be gone too quickly!

I have never been good at making bread. This recipe was easy, and delicious! My only problem was it didnt get all the way done in the middle. I am finding that with most of the breads I try to make. What am I doing wrong?

LOVE!
I come from a mennonite family where we use one cookbook for literally everything we cook. I snuck this one in for a breakfast, and my mother and I ate the whole thing with butter and homemade jam. YUM! Its now a constant request to have in the house. :)

This recipe is my first real attempt at baking. Two batches in, and its getting lighter and fluffier with each batch. I sub one cup of half white/wheat flour, which I think adds to the flavor.

This recipe is simply delicious!! I really wanted to make a fresh loaf of soft, fluffy white bread today.  I halved the recipe and made 1 loaf, although I really should have made 2 because it is going on 3pm here and there's about a quarter of it left.  I did not have any oil left after a doughnut frying adventure.  So, I simply melted some butter and used that in its place.  I also decreased the sugar, as suggested by other reviews to 2 tbs.  I coated the loaf with butter twice before I baked it, and also twice after it came out of the oven!  FANTASTIC...the flavor and texture are bang on perfect!! Thanks for sharing the recipe, it is now my go to white bread recipe!!

This is by far my favorite bread recipe yet. I've made it at least a dozen times and my family loves it. I have not tried it with the full amount of sugar so far. I use 1/3 cup and it's a perfect amount for "dinner bread". If I were going to make breakfast rolls or something like that I might use the full amount.

This was the first yeast recipe I've ever tried and it gave me all the confidence I needed to tackle my yeast phobia. It's an easy straightforward recipe that's also very flexible. I also decrease the sugar somewhat, or I replace some of the sugar with honey for a slightly different taste. I've also switched 1.5 cups of bread flour for whole wheat flour. Like another reviewer mentioned, this recipe also makes delicious dough for cinnamon rolls. Just roll it out flat, generously slather melted butter, cinnamon, and sugar on it, roll it up and slice it.

This bread is so fantastic. Sweet and yummy. I halved the recipe. Other than that, the only thing I really did different is the proofing of the yeast. I proofed the yeast according to the package directions (adding in about 2 tsp of sugar to the yeast) and mixed the rest of the sugar in with the flour. It turned out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

Definitely delivers on its promise of a dense, sweet bread.  Kids loved it.  I used all purpose flour, without any problems.  Next time, I'll make it less sweet.

I don't own a bread machine, I make mine by hand.  THis is the only bread recipe I have ever tried and I am so glad I found it first because it tastes just like my mammaw's homemade bread.  I can never get 6 cups of bread flour in there without the bread being super heavy, so I just use 5.

Our favorite bread, in order to make it less dense I add gluten when I add the first cup of flour.

Took me a few tries to get it perfect, like others said, the most important step is to proof the yeast

Ok! So last night I made this bread and I didn't follow the direction one bit. What I did was mix everything all at once(everybody in the pool). I did let is rise twice though :) The bread still came out very good. Its a pretty dense bread with a little sweetness. What got me was the little sweetness it was. I didn't think it would be sweet at all. I will for sure be making this bread more often now. Who knows maybe next time I might actually follow the directions :)

Super easy! I only wanted one loaf of bread so I halved everything. I just used one packet of active dry yeast and the loaf was huge. Delicious soft bread and the crust is not tough!

It worked perfectly the very first time. I'm so impressed with how fluffy and moist it is.  i halved the recipe and used half the amount of sugar called for, and have one heavenly loaf on my hands. 

I have been making this bread weekly.  The only thing I've noticed is that it consistently takes longer than 30 minutes for the dough to rise the second time - it's more like an hour to hour and a half, making this recipe a 3 to 3.5 hour endeavor.

I've made this bread many times now. I add a twist, I substitute 1 cup of flour for ground flax, and maple syrup for the sugar. Adds a bit more moisture while maintaining the sweetness... definitely a hit!

Wow! Amazing! I followed exactly what the recipe said. and I got two loafs of beautiful bread! My husband and I normally don't eat after 8, but we couldn't wait for the bread to be done! We are on our second slice! Two tricks make sure the water is hot and hand kneading is the way to go! My bread took over an hour to rise for the second kneading! So worth the time! This will be a keeper in my house! AAAAA++++++

This was the easiest recipe ever! I am not very experienced with breadmaking and it turned out great. My husband raved and is looking forward to sandwiches tomorrow. It made two really nice loaves and yes, mine even look just like the picture. Definitely keeping this recipe and making this again and again. Thanks for the fabulous recipe! Even for a beginner bread maker.

Perfect basic bread recipe!  It freezes and thaws very well and it makes delicious toast.  I've made lots of different variations (switching up the sweetener and/or the flour types), and it always turns out great.  The original recipe is maybe a little too sweet, so I do reduce the sugar most of the time.

I did not find this bread dense at all!  It is actually flimsy in texture and falls apart when slicing.  For improved  nutrition, the second time I made it, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added 3/4 cup of non-fat dry milk along with the flour.  The texture was better.  Overall, it is still the easiest bread recipe I've used - except for Italian peasant bread - (yeast, olive oil, water, flour & salt.)

I halved the recipe for the 1.5lb setting on my bread machine (with light crust) and it turned wonderfully. I changed nothing at all about the recipe. The texture and taste was light, soft and delicious. I prefer sweeter breads but this was not over the top sweet. My boyfriend thought it would be perfect for hot dog/hamburger buns and I agree. This is the perfect bread and I will be making it for our everyday loaves. Thank you for such a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at bread making.  It was unbelievable how easy it was to make!  I used my KitchenAid with the hook attachment so I went by other's recommendations to knead for five minutes.  My husband thought the bread was EXCELLENT.  I also cut the sugar amount to 1/3c.  I will make this many times in the future!  It's a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

Have been making this recipe routinely for about 9 month.  Made changes based on past reviews and cut back the sugar to 1/3 Cup, yeast to 1 TBL and use olive oil.  90% of the time I use 3 cups bread flour and 3 cups wheat flour.  Everyone loves it including my daughter who generally doesn't like wheat bread!

I have made this bread several times, and I absolutely love it!  I have substituded olive oil for the vegetable oil, and the results were wonderful.  I usually make one loaf of white, and add raisins and cinnamon to the other loaf - so yummy!  I don't need to try any other white bread recipe - this is it!

OMG! I will NEVER buy store-bought bread again! This bread is SO good! I made it exactly as the recipe reads... not sure exactly how much flour I used- but it was around the 6 cups. I mixed in 5 cups at first and then kneaded more until the dough as the consistancy that I wanted. It was still a little sticky (because that is how I like it).  When I kneaded again after it rose the first time, I added a little more flour. It is seriously the best bread I have EVER tasted. :o) Good luck- and have fun making the most simple and best tasting bread that I have ever made!

Great bread! I think my yeast was dead, (or dying) because it took forever to rise, and didnt even reach the top of the bread tin, let alone go over it, but it came out dense enough to cut into very thin slices so I didnt mind ( with less sugar, it would be perfect for finger sandwiches) My dad loves it, both loaves are almost gone! I better get new yeast and make more! He wants me to make bread every week now lol. Thanks so much!

My husband bought a Kitchen Aid with Christmas $ gift.  He retired this year and one of his goals was to make bread like "my mom made"!  For one month he has read and tried every piece of info he could find...to no avail.  Although all good and certainly enjoyed...this is THE ONE!!!  Absolutely the best beyond all other recipes.  He followed it exactly and has reached his goal of "just like mom's"!  It is soft and delicious...a little sweet, perfect.  Now he wants to conquer cinnamon rolls!

Very nice loafs of white bread. Used only 1/4 cup sugar, and added 5 tbsp. gluten. Used only 5 cups of the flour to mix, and used some of the 6th cup in the kneading process. I think all 6 cups of flour would have been too much for the amount of water. The dough was wonderfully soft and a pleasure to work with, and the end product turned out just as soft and fluffy. Don't forget to put a shallow pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven while baking. 
My 3 guys pretty much devoured one of the loaves with dinner.

I made this because it would make two loaves at once and my bread machine would not accomodate the amount of flour.  I made one loaf and as other users suggested, made cinnamon rolls.  Very good indeed.  I used only 1/4 C of sugar as we don't like sweet bread and it was enough for us. I used my Kitchen Aid for kneading and it didn't take long for it to pull away from the sides.  Easy Peasy! do not understand why others were cautioning.  Following the directions given will give you the desired product.

I'd call this "death by sugar". Seriously, most cakes come with 1 to 1 1/2 cups of sugar and this one gets close.
I'd suggest decreasing the sugar to the amount of salt of a neutral, standard bread serving, if it is too salty then put 3 tablespoons of sugar but don't dump the whole jar in there :)

Excellent! This came out beautiful! I used my KA and only have one loaf pan so I had to refrigerate the other loaf before the second rise. They both came out beautiful and delicious. I may cut down the sugar to 2 tbsp next time as one of the reviews stated, but this is perfect as is and is a great "every day" bread recipe that I will be making again and again. Thank you!!

Easy to follow recipe for the novice bread maker.  It's a little on the sweet side.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup,otherwise this recipe has yeilded a fool proof loaf everytime I've made it.  Rises nicely even on the coldest of days, when our kitchen only reaches about 60 degrees.  Works great in the breadmaker as well.  Just cut the recipe in half.  Makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf.

My fiancée found this exact recipe off of an Amish website. there is something magic about it I have not found anyone who has not liked it literally, and it changes flavor slightly depending on who makes it. oh and don't use metal cooking utensils and use a glass or stone bread pan.

Excellent Bread Recipe! I cut the sugar down to a 1/4cup and made 2 loaves my first go with it. Looked just like the pic and the taste was phenominal. I used this bread for french toaste and sandwiches. Even though I cut the sugar down right away Im giving it 5 starts as it turned out perfect and was still really sweet with less sugar.

I am asolutely thrilled about this recipe!  I have baked bread for years, 30 years to be exact, and this is the first time it has risen as it should.  It is delicious and beautiful. Baking bread has always been therapudic for me but also left me a bit frustrated because I knew the product wasn't all it should be, well no more!!  Let the therapy begin---I will be baking alot more often now.

What i do is when i shape the bread into loaves instead of oil the pan.. I butter all round the shape loaves of bread. Turns out perfect and that nice golden brown. Doesn't stick or burn. Just flip it upside down as soon as it comes out the oven. PERFECT!!!

I also have to say is, that i made 3 loaves out of this bread and it was gone in one night. I took one to my aunt and my aunt, her husband and her son ate the whole thing in less then 5 minutes lol. This is really good bread and it is a DEF a keeper.

This bread didn't rise the way I wanted it to in the loaf pan, but I made a loaf on a baking sheet too.   Let me just say, both loaves came out so sweet, and beautiful... And they were not dense or heavy! This is my fave! We will make it again and again!

WOW this bread is awesome!!!  Followed other reviewers advice and went with 1/3 cup sugar.  Will try full amount next time.  Hubby and 4 yr. old ATE it UP!  LOL.  Looked in my grandma's old recipe box and found the exact same recipe.  Best bread ever!

This bread is the best white bread I've ever made. It is a little sweet so I will definately reduce the amount of sugar next time, probably to 2 Tbs. I also used 1 cup water and 1 cup milk for smoother texture. After shaping them I put them in the refridgerator for a 6 hour cold rise. Let it sit out for a little, or until room temp and puncture any bubbles that form before placing in the oven. It was not dense at all like others stated. It was so soft and fluffy, just a little too sweet.

Wow this is a perfect sweeter bread recipe!  It is a little sweeter than traditional bread but that's what makes it so good!  Very easy to do.  I have made this recipe by hand and by Kitchen Aid mixer about 10 times now and it always comes out perfect as long as the water amount is correct and the yeast is fresh.  I split the flour half whole wheat and half bread flour.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it turned out fantastically. It was very sweet, but good. I might try less sugar next time.  One word of advice. Make sure your water is still 110 degrees F/45 C when you add the yeast. I found that after dissolving the sugar in the water, the temp went down significantly.

Very good and easy.  I tried my first loaf with half the sugar and vegetable shortening instead of oil and it turned out great.  Just plain ATE the first loaf with butter and used the other for french toast.  Will make again and again! Thanks.

Excellent Recipe.....thank you for sharing.  I too cut down on the sugar when making "white bread" but used the recommended amount when I turned it into Cinnamon Swirl bread.  Both variations turned out great.

loved this bread; reduced the sugar as per someone's suggestion and it was excellent.  I have made bread for years, and this is better than what I used to make!  Doesn't seem as much work as my typical recipe and it turned out perfect.  I allowed it to raise a little longer than what was called for.  A very light (in weight and tase) bread.

If you like sweet, white bread, this is your winner. I made this with my 2 and 3 year olds and they adored the process and although our bread didn't turn out quite as "beautiful" as the loaves pictured (thanks to their unique approach to kneading, lol), it was still scrumptious.

GREAT Recipe, But Definitely TOO much sugar. I should have read the reviews better before making the bread. It is unbearably sweet, I actually put in just a little bit more than 2/3 cups sugar..Bad Idea lol Its not totally horrible and You can still tell this is Great Bread!!! My advice (like others) Tone down the sugar a bit and it IS WONDERFUL :)

Oh my goodness, this is the most delicious thing ever!!! I took some advice from previous posts and did one loaf regular and then just did another one the cinnamon swirl. They are both so amazing!!! I didn't decrease the sugar any, and just love how it turned out! It reminds me of the bread my great grandmother used to make. And my house smells wonderful to boot! Thank you so much!

Ok, so I've had my spurts of making bread and then not, using a bread machine and then not and I've had varying degrees of success. This was great though. It was super easy, I didn't need to run to the store before I could start. I'm making it again right now.

I love this recipe. I've made it quite a few times now exactly as it is written. It makes a very sweet dough. Everytime I have baked it, the dough in the center of my loaf is underdone, while the crust is perfect. This could be my oven or cheap pan..? However, this dough makes delicious, perfect Parker House rolls. After the first rising, form dough into 1" balls in greased muffin tins and allow to rise 30 minutes. Then bake until golden. I always keep a batch of them in the freezer.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  Made this over the weekend and had a lot of success.  From prior comments I went easy on the sugar.  It's definitely a sweet white bread even putting a little less sugar in than the recipe calls for, so sugar to taste!

easy, quick, just plain ol' good  white bread... & since the recipe makes 2 loaves, I made Cinnamon White Raisins Rolls & a plain one. I'd even experimented further by adding cheeses & rosemary on my loaves. Hv sent URLs to all my friends too!!! Can't recall when was the last time I bought store breads. 
Cheers & hv fun trying!!!  *smiles*

With 4 kids I have been trying to make bread instead of buying so much each week and this recipe turned out great. My picky daughter actually ate this one in her lunch the first day and said she liked it, unlike the other recipes I have tried. I did use 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour and 4 cups Unbleached All Purpose FLour (hard Wheat) instead of the 6 cups of regular bread flour. It was more by accident but it turned out just fine and I am getting the whole wheat in the kids' diet too.

I think this is a good recipe. original version is a little to sweet for me, but I decreced the amount of to 1/2 a cup and it tasted much better to my tastes. The sweet version was a real hit though with pb&j sandwiches

WONDERFUL!  I decided my daughter would take lunches to school this year.  Her sandwiches will include homemade bread.  This one passed the taste test with flying colors.  Hubby likes it too!  I know she will have fresh bread all the time!  This bread remained soft for three days!  That's is great for homebaked bread!

I have been looking for a bread recipe that I would make sweet breads/rolls with. I have found it!! I have made this 2 time with in a week. The fist time a made cinnamon rolls. 1/2 the batch with raisins and 1/2 the batch with pecans (2 doz total). The 2nd time a made 1 doz cinnamon rolls and 1 cinnamon, raisin bread. Next time I plan to make it plan to see how that turns out. Great recipe..My family and friends said it was a keeper.. They are very picky on what goes in to the keeper list!!!!

Making my second batch of this today.  This was a BIG hit with my family and easy to make.  It was great warm out of the oven, as toast and would also make good sandwiches.

A nice bread.  Cut the sugar to no more that 1/2 cup.  Also, there is no need to proof the yeast, the French don't.  Just mix the yeast sugar, salt and oil in the flour.  Stir with a spatula until a shaggy mass then put in mixer with dough hook.  Cuts prep time to 10 minutes.  Four stars because six cups of flour won't fill or make two regular sized loaves in 9x5 pans.

I love this bread and I make it every week.  I made six loaves for a bake sale at my daughter's school and they all sold within 15 minutes (I had samples out).  In fact, my sample loaf sold too!  It is sweeter than your average white bread, but we like that feature.  The BEST PB&J sandwich we have ever tasted is made with this bread after it has cooled for about an hour.

Amazing! I've tried so many bread recipes that have failed miserably. This was easy, quick, uncomplicated and produced two beautiful, tasty loaves of bread. Doesn't get better than this! Even a novice could make this work. Thanks, Peg for sharing this one!

I have never been very good at making bread.  Until now.  This is the most awesome and simple recipe I have ever found and my entire family loves it.  I have made it several times now, and lately I add a tablespoon of flax seeds to the dough for extra awesomeness.  It is wonderful for sandwiches, toast, with soup, anything.  :)

Easy to make . . . makes excellent toast and is sturdy enough for awesome sandwiches.  My family likes sweeter bread . . . and this was PERFECT!  My 18 year old has informed me that he will only be eating sandwiches off of this bread from now on.  I better get busy!

Spectacular!! I used this bread to try to replicate my MIL's recipe that made 7 loaves! So I used 1/4 cup brown sugar (no white) and 1/4 cup melted shortening (not oil). Also used 3 1/2 cups white and 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour.  I baked in two 8 x 4" bread pans and they turned out absolutely delicious, moist, and EXACTLY what I was looking for!

I love this bread! It is great made strictly by the recipe. It can be modified a lot without problems.  Sometimes  I use honey and butter in place of sugar and oil, and add raisins. I rarely use more than a fourth of a cup of sugar.

I made this bread since it had a small amount of ingredients, but it ended up being a BIG treat.  Instead of making a 2 loafs, I made 1 big loaf which took ~50 minutes to bake.  Great recipe!

Ever since I started making my own bread this recipe has been my all time favorite for white bread and a great starting point for my other concoctions.  I often make a strawberry oat bread by adding 1 cup of sliced strawberries (fresh or frozen,,,,juice and all) 2 cups of oats and reduce the flour to 4 cups.  MMMMMMMMMMMM Good!

It's tasted really good. My first attempt at bread, so I split the recipe and only made one loaf. I thought it tasted more like dinner rolls than bread but still tasty.

Fantastic bread recipe. This has become my definitive white bread recipe because it is easy to prepare and the taste and texture is just wonderful. I like the subtle sweetness and the soft texture of the bread. The bread is even soft the next day! The possibilites are endless with this recipe and I highly recommend this recipe!

I have been making this bread for about 4 years and have entered it in the county fair twice and walked away with a blue ribbon both times. With a Kitchen Aid mixer it is so easy, fast and delicious. Great for a get well gift......

I've been making this recipe for years and apologize for waiting to do a review. My husband could take a loaf of this, a stick of butter and make, as he says, "a meal out of it"! Of that, I have no doubts. It is tender, flavorful, easy, and the aroma of freshly baked bread is overwhelmingly downhome comfort!  This is a well-used, lovingly kept recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Very good! I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. Everything else I followed from the original recipe. It was my first time making bread by hand, and it turned out very moist and fluffy. Looking forwards to making it again!

We make this constantly.  At least once a week.  Great for rolls and a quick ham and cheese sandwich.  I'd feel ungrateful if I didn't give it a rating.  And it deserves each of those five stars.

I'm so excited!!!  I chose this recipe to be my first ever home-made bread.  I am so thrilled with the outcome!  I think at least one poster said that it was too sweet, but I think it's perfect.  Light, airy and fantastic - even though I'm pretty sure I kneaded it too much.  Thank you so much Peg for posting!

This bread was great!  My daughter and I liked the sweet taste.  You could also decrease the sugar in it.  I made one loaf of bread and made the other half of the dough into a dozen cinnamon rolls, which were great!  I formed the rolls at the same time I formed the loaf.  I then put the rolls into the refrigerator overnight, and in the morning I let them sit at room temperature for about 2 hours, then baked them.

I found this in my Allrecipes cookbook and have made it countless times.  It is the easiest and best bread recipe.  I have never had luck before with making bread, and this is so fun to make! And it makes the house smell wonderful all day!   Reading the reviews, I will reduce the sugar next time (there is bread rising as I type...LOL), and add some flax seed next time.  I almost always use half for bread and half for the best cinnamon rolls you will ever eat!  I don't measure, but use, sugar, brown sugar, melted butter and chopped walnuts...oh, my.  Soooo good!  Have fun with it.

This is amazing bread!  It is very easy to make.  I mixed all of the ingredients according to the directions and then I put it into my bread machine to kneed and rise and then took it back out and put the dough into the bread pans.  This bread came out so light and wonderful.  My son could not believe me when I told him I made it.  He said he was surprised because it was not heavy.  Makes wonderful grilled cheese sandwiches.

I love, love, love this bread! You can't really mess it up. I don't have a bread machine so I made it traditionally by hand. Perfect! My husband and sons devoured them. They told me not to buy bread anymore. Make sure you read one of the reviews below for making this by hand. When I first made this I used half of the dough for the loaf pan and the other half I made 8 cinnamon rolls. The tasted wonderful! I won't buy anymore cinnamon rolls at delis and bakeries. And oh... don't skimp on sprinkling cinnamon and brown sugar on the dough for the cinnamon rolls.

I have made this many times and it is the best recipe I have ever used.  I also am making it as whole wheat and my wife loves it.  It takes a little more water when you mix in the flour but always turns out great

I have tried a number of bread recipes with terrible results. I am a novice at bread making and a lot of things such as how much should the bread rise, how much should I knead to get smooth dough and how smooth is smooth really are not very intuitive to me. In spite of these shortcomings this recipe yielded two tasty, soft, fluffy loaves of bread. If I can get this recipe right, anyone can! Adjustments I made:  1) Cut sugar to 1/4 cup like almost everybody suggested.  2) I live at 5000ft and its very dry. So I could only add in 5.25 cups of flour.  I am never buying bread again!

After reading the reviews I too decreased the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. It was still a little sweet for our taste. My husband thought it was better day 2. It was fresh tasting even days later. I don't make bread often. This recipe is easy and foolproof. Thanks!

I made a loaf of bread and a batch of rolls with this recipe...the bread is still baking, but the rolls are DELICIOUS.  The only change I made was to decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I followed the suggestions from the first review on making it in a KA mixer, and it came out beautifully.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe, I feel so accomplished to have made such successful bread!

This is an amazing bread recipe! I have been making yeast breads and rolls for more than 25 years and have not found an easier, more delicious recipe that can actually be produced in less than 3 hrs. In the past two weeks, I've made this recipe at least 5 times, experimenting with additions such as herb de provence for rolls and currents, candied orange rind and lemon rind for hot cross buns. The results have been shared with family and neighbors with rave reviews. Thanks for sharing such and easy, outstanding recipe!

I had really high hopes, but it took almost a cup less flour and came out very dough-y.  It tasted a little raw.  I even left one loaf in to cook (the other was already cut) during our dinner and after 30 more minutes of cooking, it still was way too dense and their were raw spots.  I was really hoping to find bread that was so easy, but this was not it.

This is the most wonderful bread my family has ever tasted. We now make it instead of buying store bread. The greatest thing is that I can pronouce every ingredient. I like to make some in my circle glass dish so that you get long large slices for big sandwiches. My husband loves that. Thank you for a healthy bread recipe.

My husband think I'm the best thing since sliced bread. Literally. I came out great. Only thing I would do differently next time is use 1/2 stick of butter instead of the oil. I was out of vegetable oil and had to use canola which gave my loaf an oil stinch. Yuck, but it tasted gloriously.  Can't go wrong with butter though. The directions were easy and I didn't have to wait a day or two to finish it.

This bread is very easy to make and has a sweet taste that leaves you begging for more. I have found that the baking time varies greatly from day to day, and the recipe baking time is much too long. The less you overcook your bread, the sweeter it tastes. Once it is brown on the top and you can tap it with a finger and hear a hollow sound, its done. Pull that baby out and let it cool down for at least 10 minutes before devouring.

Mine didn't rise after I punched it down, but I think it takes "talent" to make bread - obviously I don't have it!  The dough tasted good, but I thought it could be sweeter.  I will try again (and again until I get it!)

This bread turned out absolutely perfect for me. I did let the bread rise a little more than 30 minutes the second time in the bread pans.   I want to make a note that the most important thing to do when making homeade bread is to let the yeast proof! It makes all the difference. It makes the bread so much lighter and fluffier.

This bread was fairly easy and it came out so beautiful.  It is kind of sweet though.  I did substitute a few items.  I used raw cane sugar instead of white and light olive oil instead of vegetable.  Thanks

Amazing bread!  This was my first attempt at making bread and I really think that it turned out perfectly.   The only problem I had was that I really don't know how to knead properly.  I would have liked more instructions on that part.  Otherwise, it tasted great!

This bread was very filling. It had a very thick consistency when it was done baking. Dense, hearty, and delicious - this is the bread to make if one sandwich is supposed to be your meal.

I chose this recipe to follow in my first attempt at making bread and it came out better than I ever expected.  Like others have said, follow the directions exactly and you'll have two excellent loaves of white bread.  I'm considering making this recipe a weekly activity, just to save some money on store-bought bread price increases.

I prefer my recipe that is similar to this.  I found this too sweet to be a good dinner bread and the use of water instead of milk had this one lacking the flavor I prefer.

I've never made bread before.  This was my first bread recipe.  It turned out FANTASTIC!  I made the dough and realized I didn't have normal bread pans! Idiot!  Luckily my Mom had four small bread pans that I could use.  I thought the whole thing was garbage because of pan size, but, to my suprise they turned out Perfect and Delicous.  I will be making this again in the future again for sure.

I made this today, with the "help" of my 2 yr old daughter.  We used my KitchenAid mixer with the dough  hook.  It was so simple and the bread came out beautifully!  I'm so excited-this was my first yeast bread and it's great.  My husband loves it-he says it's similar to Challah bread.  It is rich, so I may cut back on the sugar with my next batch.  Awesome-thanks for sharing this Peg!!

This is an  AWESOME, versatile recipe!  It's great fresh out of the oven, toasted, used for sandwich bread, etc.  I only used 1/2 the sugar but that is simply a matter of taste as another reviewer said.  This will officially become a staple in our house.  I LOVE making bread and make it often this time of year.  This is the easiest and most versatile and best recipe so far!

Absolutely foolproof!  You can even convert it to wheat bread by replacing half the bread flour with whole wheat and it's just as tasty too and healthier.

Wow. I made this when my parents came into town, and they couldn't get enough of it! They kept saying how I was such a good cook...boy how I fooled them.  I did put less sugar, as I like my bread lighter, but that is a matter of preference.

An easy, quick bread recipe. I have made in several times. It is rather sweet and dense. I substituted half of the sugar for Splenda, but it wasn't as good. Stays a very light color even after it is done.

Very nice loaf of bread, quite sweet but oh so tasty warm from the oven.  I did cut the recipe in half but I still needed to knead in about 3/4 cup extra flour (in order not to be sticky).  It rose nice and high.  I brushed with egg yolk before baking and put a pan of water into the bottom shelf of the oven to bake along with the bread.  The crust was perfect.

FANTASTIC bread. I believe my husband (who is extremly picky) called this "sublime" at dinner. It's sweet, crusty and just all around great. Thank you for sharing this!

As so many other reviewers have said, this is truly an easy, fool-proof bread recipe.    I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and make it totally in my KitchenAid.  I divide the dough into 4 small loaves and bake side by side on a bar pan or in small aluminum loaf pans - either way it turns out great.    Along with making the white bread, I use this as a base recipe and substitute other flours for some of the white;  such as whole wheat, rye, oatmeal, etc.  My favorite is 1/2 whole wheat with sesame seeds on top.  It has a wonderful nutty taste when toasted.  It also makes incredible cinnamon raisin bread (I bump up the sugar to 1/2 cup for this).  I bake this bread every week and can't seem to keep any on hand.  It gets eaten or given away as fast as I can make it.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it's wonderful. My kids devoured it and I'm having a hard time from eating it all up, too. LOL There is nothing like fresh bread baking in the oven and this will make even a novice, such as myself, feel like a pro!

I absolutely love this recipe! It's especially good for college students who don't have much time or money. Make sure you follow the recipe exactly, and it is wonderful.

I've been on a mission to find the easiest, quickest bread recipe as we have stopped buying bread at the store. This one is the best I've found so far! I don't however, put as much sugar (i've used Splenda too and it works great) for "everyday" bread. Thanks for sharing!

Simply divine!  With a KitchenAid, this bread is dead simple...but even without one, it's easy and makes a delicious loaf of bread.  I've adapted it to make wheat bread by switching out 2 cups of white flour for 2 cups of wheat, but it needs to rise for about twice as long.

I've been making this bread daily for almost a year now.  My kids love it.  Most days it is gone by lunch.  I like the light clean taste with the touch of sweet.  The bread is not a sweet bread though.  Its just balanced.  I also like the simple ingredients that I always have on hand.  The only ingredient that I might use different from other people is I always use high quality favorful salt.

Thank you! Have been looking for this kind of recipe. Worked well folded out into dinner rolls, I oiled the tops, covered with cloth, let set overnight, baked in early morning. My loaves were great, had to give some away!!!

Wow Wow Wow!  Great recipe and very easy to make.  I followed the tips for using a stand mixer, cut the sugar back to 2 Tbsp, and had spectacular results.  Thanks for sharing this, Peg.

I have been baking bread many years.  This is a fantastic bread recipe.  Very easy.  I used my Kitchen aid mixer and it is a breeze to mix and knead!!  I made small loaves of bread and also made into cinnamon bread.  My family LOVES this bread warm with BUTTER and my HOMEMADE JAM AND JELLY!!!

I've made this three times now; the first two times, I was pretty lazy and  used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour, no baking stone, glaze or steam, resulting in dense though entirely edible loaves (I kneaded the second batch for about 20 minutes, and that seemed to help). The third time I decided to go all out and used bread flour, as well as a baking stone and a pan of hot water for steam, and what a difference it made! Half of the batch was used for *terrific* sandwich rolls (my incredibly picky and, at that point, fairly suspicious boyfriend said they tasted store-bought), about a quarter for some spur-of-the-moment cinnamon rolls, and the last quarter is baking now into a glorious, crusty loaf with an egg yolk wash. This one's a keeper.

First time bread baker here! I followed the recipe and used the KitchenAid tips from another reviewer. Everything came out perfectly! I'm glad I didn't cut down on the amount of sugar because the bread tastes exactly the same as it does in Amish country!

This bread was really, really good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a little bit heavier than what I was looking for, and the texture wasn't quite as fine as I wanted.  I've made it three times now, and each time it seems to be better than the last, so maybe practice makes perfect.  I did try something new this time, though. Instead of punching down the dough, I gently pressed it out and rolled it into a loaf for the loaf pan. That seemed to help with the heaviness factor, though it made the texture less fine.

This bread is so easy to make and it is very good.  My children love this bread, if my children like it that means it is good.  (They are very picky eaters.)  I usually get two loaf and a small loaf that I make cinnamon swirl bread with.

I have made A LOT of bread and this is by far the best in texture!  I used only 1/3 C. sugar and 3 C. bread flour and 3 C. whole wheat and it turned out perfectly. Additionally, with all white bread flour, I tried adding cheddar cheese cubes and jalapenos and let them rise only 25-30 mins on the second rise to make more of a moist dinner roll.  They were fabulous!

Warning to kitchen aid mixers: this recipe stripped my mixer's gears when I tried to follow one of the reviewers advice about kneading it with the mixer!  It got halfway through the kneading when it stopped turning, and now needs repair!  The good news is the bread still turned out great - very tasty.  Will make again, but may knead by hand next time.

Great for beginners like me. I also made it with 4 cups whole wheat and 2 cups bread flour. It turned out great. Oven baking worked better for me than my bread machine (but that could just be the breadman machine that I used.)For my personal taste I will use only half the sugar next time.

I cannot say enough about how good and simple this bread is.  The first time I made it at home for my family and they loved it!! I read the reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and made half the bread into a loaf, half into rolls.  I personally did not eve notice the sugar.  The second time I made this bread with my preschool class. They had a great time mixing an kneading by hand!! This time I used the full 2/3 cup of sugar and we made the entire thing into rolls.  It turned out beautifully brown and soft.  But I think that was too much sugar as it was a little bit too much on the sweet side.  Next time I will play with it to see what is the perfect sugar amount for me.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!

We have stopped buying bread.  This is the one we love.  Easy to do and a wonderful flavor.  I have used this recipe to make a yummy cinnamon raisin bread.  I will, at time just mix in dried fruit when I knead the dough.  Simplly delightful.

Awesome Recipe!  I found this years go on this site and have been using it ever since.  It's a wonderful dense sweet white bread which tastes great on sandwiches or toast.  It is very easy to flavor this bread.  I've added fresh or dried herbs for herb bread, cinnamon and raisins for raisin bread, a banana for a yeast banana bread, and even half a can of pumpkin with apple pie spice for a yeast pumpkin bread.  Experiment with it have fun!

absolutely perfect and was the exact taste i was hoping for! this is the first bread recipe i've ever made with yeats and couldn't be simpler. I did read some reviews, but decided to stick with all called for ingredients. I LIKE the sweetness of the bread, it's great for all types of sandwiches or even by itself or as toast! I didn't know what to expect for yeast 'proofing', but do make sure the temperature is 110!! It'll get a nice caramel-colored foamy top and that's when you know it's "proofed." Also, don;t forget about your pan loaves rising like I did for an hour cause they'll grow to 6+" above the pan, whoops. They do 'deflate' so to speak if you touch them.  Overall, tonight is the second time i've made this recipe in a week. That's 4 loaves of bread between my boyfriend and I, so it really is delicious. THANK YOU!

I love this recipe. So easy to make. When my kids smell this bread when they come off the bus they run! It is sweet but not too sweet and is like heaven with butter and homemade strawberry jam. If you are debating on making this - just do it. You won't regret it. It is BLISS!

This is the first bread recipe I have ever tried and it came out great!  I did not make any changes because I really did not have a clue what I was doing.  This is also toddler and husband approved.

My four year old son said this is MANY, MANY REALLY, REALLY GOOD bread!  I did not reduce the sugar and the loaves taste really good.  I even forgot to add sugar early, so I added it after I mix the salt and oil.

i have made this recipe several times over, now. each time it turns out better & better. because we don't like sweet bread as much in my household, i decrease the sugar to 1-2 tablespoons, blip in however much olive oil looks right & add the flour 1-2 cups at a time, so as not to over-add it. it is an extraordinary recipe, thank you so much for sharing it with us!

The closest you will get to store bought white bread! I love this recipe, and was so happy to find it on this website as the majority of bread recipes require a bread machine, which I don't have. Plus there's a certain satisfaction that comes with doing all the hard work yourself instead of letting a machine do it. Anyway, this bread is wonderful! It makes two delicious loaves, one of which doesn't make it to the end of the day. It's a tad hard to cut, but if you let it sit overnight or pop it in the fridge to let it cool, it's easier to cut into slices. This is now my ONLY recipe for bread!

Super tasty.  I did everything per the recipe except I did use my mixer's dough hooks for the mixing.  Both loaves came out great.

Tried this bread tonight. First homemade bread I ever made without a bread machine and I think it came our pretty good. My husband liked the crust, nice and crispy. I like the sweetness of the bread. The bread has a medium density.Very delicious. I plan on surprising my Mom with some. Thanks for a keeper!

Wonderful and easy! The dough rose flawlessly for me, both times. My only issue was that it was a little sweeter than I was looking for, however I believe it's supposed to be sweet, next time I make white bread I will use this recipe again, but use only half the sugar and hope it works as well again. Great recipe!

Really delicious bread recipe. For something different, I like to use this dough for fried bread. Just make the dough as normal, but don't worry too much about letting it rise. then fry in a pan with butter to cook it. So sweet and tasty!

This is the best white bread I have tried and since then, had used this for home use and for events like private parties and church gatherings. THANK YOU! You inspired me that now I own two books of authentic AMISH COOKING AND BAKING BOOKS!  The bread comes out soft and tasty. And it is easy to do!

Fantastic Recipe.  I have not bought any bread since I found this recipe.  I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and I cover it after 15 min. of baking so it doesn't get too dark.  Now if only I could find a good french bread recipe   ;-)

oh yum! one of two loaves is almost gone. and will not live out the hour. This was my first time making bread by hand, I usually plop everything in my bread maker/machine.  I am completely inspired to make more breads by hand. To have them cook evenly- I placed the pans side by side on the rack.

I just got my first bread maker and have been going crazy making several different recipes!  This bread is my family's absolute FAVORITE!  The first time I made it, my 4 year old ate 3/4 of the whole loaf himself and named it, "my yummy bread."  I've made about 6 loaves of this bread over the past few days and it is always gone in minutes!  Thank you for the recipe!!

This bread is so good. My husband and I had the first loaf almost gone when it was still warm from the oven. I used about a half a stick of butter and less oil. I also split the top and brushed it with butter every ten minutes while baking and on the last 10 minutes I brushed it with egg white. So easy to make. Thanks for ruining my diet lol.

I did this in mini loaves at Christmas and they were delicious.  I did the recipe again, this time making them a little larger and while good it was not as sweet as the smaller loaves (thickness maybe?).  This is a great recipe and this is the one I will using for my white bread for now on.

Quite easy to make as the ingredients are basic. Took a while to knead the dough cos' it was quite sticky and couldn't get it to be smooth. I baked it using a convector oven so cut back by 5 mins of baking time. Also reduced sugar after reading reviews. The crust was initially hard but when it cooled down, the loaf was soft and moist.

This is a terrific recipe. I put all ing. in the bread machine on the dough cycle and followed the directions from #3 on. It did take twice the amount of time to rise, though. I will probably use a little less sugar next time, too.  Makes wonderful toast!

This recipe is very similar to our 150 year old family bread recipe with the exception of oil vs. lard. (I like the oil better!) As a variation, I made  coffee cakes by dividing the dough into two round balls, placed on cookie sheet. Brush 2 tablespoons of melted butter on the dough. Sprinkle over dough: mixture: 1 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of flour and some cinnamon.

Unbelievable!  I tried this because I was looking for the perfect white bread.  I did learn that if I use a 1 lb. bread pan I could use three pans, or I could make two loaves of bread and a half dozen sandwich rolls.  I followed other reviewers who wrote that they would reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup, and used my Kitchen Aid, also following the recommendation of other reviewers.  Oh, my goodness!  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S !

Love this bread, has good body and taste. It slices up perfectly, I think due to it being a little denser, it will not collapse and crush when putting the knife through it. The best homemade bread we have ever had!

We love this bread!  It was light and slightly sweet.  I could have ate the whole loaf!  I fixed it in bread machine on the dough cycle and then put it in a loaf pan and let it rise and then baked it in my regular oven.  This is a keeper!

This recipe was wonderful!  I had been looking for a bread recipe to use to make dinner rolls for Christmas, and thought I would try this one.  The first time I did it, I listened to some reviewers and used half the sugar.  It was wonderful and everyone loved it...as a breakfast bread.  To make the diner rolls I just used 1/4 the sugar and they came out perfect!  Will use this recipe again!!

I have done very few reviews, as few things have impressed me as much as this bread.  I followed the instructions pretty exactly, except for kneading with my KitchenAid for about 6 minutes as opposed to hand kneading.  (Also, I did not find the bread too sweet with the full amount of sugar.) I was afraid the 6 cups of flour would be too much, as the dough itself seemd a little stiff,  but it was perfect.  The loaves were beautiful.  I ate three slices hot out of the oven with butter for dinner.  I didn't even WANT anything else.  This is the best loaf bread recipe I have ever tried, and I'm not a novice bread baker.  Easy and wonderful. I'll be making again and again.

I like this recipe for a couple of reasons; it makes two loaves and it's very forgiving.  I set out to bake this while I did laundry and cleaned the house.  I got diverted during the second rise and finally got it into the oven to bake after rising for about 45-50 minutes.  Good thing, since it produced a beautiful tall loaf ideal for sandwiches.  I didn't find it overly sweet at all.  This has a great crust and is actually somewhat light in texture.  I'll definitely make this again. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Awesome recipe, great results.  I took everyone's advice and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, I also let the 2nd rise go longer.  Result was a nice fluffy amazingly good bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

BEAUTIFUL loaf of bread! Looks, smells and tastes like everything I want in a white bread.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup after reading other reviews, but it is going to be my new daily recipe!  THANK YOU for sharing it with us.

Absolutely 5 stars!  Incredibly easy recipe, comes out consistantly beautiful every single time.  I use a Kitchen Aid for kneading.  I love the recipe as is, but sometimes substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour and add a tablespoon of wheat germ for a little crunch.

ok so I love sweet bread and decide to make this to go with a spicy sausage minestrone soup. Awesome combo!! I'm no good at mesuring and generally guestimate since I don't even own a measuring cup...made two double recipes figuring since I have made bread a zillion times I could pretty much wing it...man was I wrong!!! First batch failed: not enough flour I royally botched it. Second batch amazing!! I don't use loaf pans so I braided it slapped on an egg yolk wash and baked like an hour since I used one recipe per loaf...looked amazing tasted even better!!! Thank you for the great recipe!

This bread is so good!  I made one loaf normally, and made the other cheesy.  I rolled it out, spread a little butter on it, sprinkled it with shredded cheddar cheese, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Then I rolled it up, put some butter on the top, sprinkled cheese, garlic and onion powder, and dillweed on top...it's delicious!  This bread is so versatile!  I will definitely make it again!

This recipe reminds me of the bread my grandma used to bake. I make it often and I usually use honey or maple syrup instead of the white sugar. Either way it's yummy. I let mine rise to about 2" above the bread pan before baking and it's always light and fluffy.

I haven't used this recipe yet, but I have a problem with my flour measurements for breads. I'd like to try the suggestion here in the comments, that I should measure by weight. Can someone tell me the equivalent of cups in weight? In other words, what does a standard cup of flour weigh?

I have been looking and trying to bake a simple loaf of bread from scratch for many years. It either was raw in the middle or didn't raise the birds really enjoyed it. Thank you very much. I did use all-purpose flour and followed breadguys suggesstions for lower sugar and Kitchen Aid mixer. Thanks again to both of you. I have mastered bread at least my family says so.

This bread was truly as simple to make as the reviews state! I made it by the recipe the first time, but next time will decrease the sugar as suggested. My loaves did not rise in 30 minutes as the recipe stated... it took probably double that. When they didn't rise much in thirty minutes, I sat them ontop of the oven and they rose much quicker. Baked up beautifully! Family devoured it! Will make again and again!

After not baking bread for 15 years, I decided to give this a try, because it seemed like a nice foolproof recipe for just plain 'ol whitebread.  And it is exactly that.  I've made it twice now, and will definitely keep making it.  A little sweet, so you might want to adjust the sugar.  The first loaf was gone before bedtime, and it is a hit with the entire family.  Good for French toast, good with butter & honey, good for sammiches, good for 'bout anything.  Boy, those Amish sure know how to bake!  Thanks, Peg- you rock!

like others have said...would give it more stars if i could...and of course i did my own tweaking.  i lessed the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup...then i put in some honey, about a tablespoon or so.  i love to use honey when i  bake bread.  i also put half water/half canned milk in.  i usually always use canned milk in any of my recipes.   i used this recipe to make bread bowls .  so i didn't make loaves, i made the bread bowls instead.  i had four nice-sized bowls from this recipe.  also, i added some italian seasoning to the dough...gave it a little extra flavoring...i had used the bread bowls for meatballs.  so i wanted them to have an italian flavor.  honestly, my husband couldn't say enough about this recipe.  he makes bread sometimes too.  so he was really impressed with this.  it's such an easy recipe....i believe it is probably fail-proof.  have fun making and sit back and wait for the ooh's and ahh's!!  :-)

There is a very good reason why so many reviewers have given this recipe 5 starts, because it's the best.

This is the first yeast bread recipe I've ever made, and right from the start it has come out perfect for me every time. After reading so many reveiwer say that they reduced the amount of sugar, I do most of the time, if I'm wanting sandwich style bread, If I'm making it more to just butter and eat plain, then I add the full amount of sugar.

This is a great recipe and easy to make, but for some reason it takes about twice as long in my oven. Am I doing something wrong?

This was my maiden voyage in bread making (sans a bread maker, no less!)  I was a little concerned at times that I had done something wrong (trying to interpret foamy yeast and giving it a little extra time during the initial rise) but in the end, it came out great.  I did have to help it rise the second time by sticking it a warm oven since it must've been a little too cool in my house for it to rise on it's own.  Because of the pans that I had, 1/2 was baked in a Pampered Chef bread pan, the other 1/2 in a Pyrex dish.  I do have to say that the 1/2 baked in the stone seemed to cook more evenly and was a bit better so it you have the choice...  Both were good though!

I made this bread for the first time today. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 after reading the reviews. The bread turned out perfect. I sifted my flour and rolled the dough out into a retangal the rolled it up and placed it the loaf pans. This bread is by far the best.

I made this as directed, except doubled it to make 4 loaves.  Nice dough to work with.
I had to bake it 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  The bread had a fine, tender texture.  the flavor is plenty sweet, my husband liked it that way.  I may cut back a little next time. This dough would also be great for caramel rolls or buns.

I followed this recipe as directed and it was awsome. I didnt think it was as sweet as some suggested. it was not as sweet as Kings Hawaiian but a litter sweeter than plain white bread. I feel there is no need to adjust this recipe. Its perfect as-is.

I planned to use this mostly for sandwiches, so I took the advice to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup. The bread is still plenty sweet.  I also used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and the bread turned out great!  The texture is very soft.

Loved it. Did it for 4-H and got a blue - it was slightly undercooked, but tasted really good.

I first made this recipe just to see how it tastes, boy did I get the best and easiest recipe.  I ate the first loaf in about an hour and had to use great restraint for the other loaf, Now it is a family favorite.  VERY, VERY, TASTY. An alternate variation that we did was to cut half a cup of sugar and add one cup of raisons.

Good recipe!  I have substituted 2 cups of whole wheat flour and cut back on the sugar as others have suggested.  I made 1/2 the dough into a loaf and the other half into rolls (baked for 15 minutes) and they were soft and yummy.  The loaf was a little too light with only 1/4 c sugar, but was better with 1/2 c.  Will make again!

Our family favorite!  I usually double the recipe.  It keeps well in a zip lock bag or wrapped in plastic.  Also, freezes well.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made this bread tonight and I love it!  I used about HALF the amount of sugar, and it turned out great.  It takes about 5-10 minutes for the yeast to proof with the sugar and water.  I made two cinnamon rolls and a french bread loaf out of it.  I like to brush the bread with a little bit of cream before I stick it in the oven so that the tops brown.  I will be making this recipe again!

Fabulous! The only change is that I decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup.  My husband, who rarely eats bread, loves this bread recipe.  I make this atleast once a week. I bake both loaves and freeze one - It freezes very well.  Since I found this recipe we don't buy bread at the grocery store anymore!

The bread came out very well, but its very sweet, more like a dessert bread than any white bread.  I give it 3 stars for being a white bread, but with the addition of apples or raisins, or other additions, it would be an absolutely fantastic sweet bread.

This bread is the best bread I have made to date.  It's full of flavor and incredibly easy to make.  If you can read directions, this is the recipe for you.  I sprinkled Cheddar Cheese on the top and it was great.  I recommend that if you want to make rolls out of this recipe, it's possible but make the dough balls small.  I made some and the rolls are like mini loaves of bread.

My husband is so happy I found this recipe! My breadmaker went to "breadmaker heaven" and we were both dying for some homemade bread. I followed the recipe, except for the sugar - I used 1/4 cup like many other posters did.  Easy as Pie! Perfectly sweet!

I can finally make bread thanks to this recipe!!  Made the dough using my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hooks. I made a couple of changes (but I'm sure it would have been just as delicious if I hadn't):  I used melted butter in the place of the oil, threw in about a cup of raisins when the dough began to pull together, and added about 1.5 tbsp of cinnamon.  This recipe gave me loaves; my husband finished one of them within two hours of coming out of the oven!  Thanks--

Wonderful. I made this for dinner last nite. My teenagers and hubby ate almost both loaves. They want me to keep making this and stop buying it from the store. The recipe didn't say how to mix it and I tried mixing with a spoon as my stand mixer broke and I never replaced it. A hand mixer is not powerful enough for the job and I had to do the best I could with a wooden spoon and my hands. It still came out nicely tho. My hubby went out and bought me a new kitchen aid stand mixer today because he loved this bread so much.

This is my favorite bread to make, I will not use any other recipe anymore, because this one is too simple.  I make it for my Feingold Family, and have it memorized.  Anyhow, There are 3 things I do different which are I add real butter instead of oil, I use about 1/3 of a cup of sugar, and after I put the dough together and kneed it, I punch it down after 10-15 minutes then let it raise again like the recipe calls for.  A tip a polish restaurant gave me about their homemade bread making.  Thanks and good luck.

Not that this needs another 5 star review... but this bread is sooo easy and sooo delicious. Made it the other day and its as good the second day (toasted, with a little butter..yummm!) as it is fresh out of the oven.

Best white bread recipe ever. Thanks so much. I've been using it for a year and a half now. It's a regular now. Sometimes I add half the sugar and brush the top with egg... small variations depending on my mood. Overall it is the perfect base recipe. Cheers!

This came out wonderful! I used my kitchen Aid instead of the bread machine and baked this in the oven. I also cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup. Remember this will make 2 loaves. Instead of using oil for the bowl I sprayed cooking spray in the bowl prior to me putting the dough in and then I sprayed the dough on top and covered with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. I will definitely use this again and again. My family loved this recipe!

I made 2 single batches of this recipe on my first try, and while I put in a little less sugar than in says (1/3rd of a cup in each bowl) it was fantastic. I wasnt able to put in all six cups of flour, but at about 5 1/4 cups, it had a great consistency and was incredibly tender and just...wicked! As soon as it came out of the oven, the kids wanted warm peanut butter sandwiches, and they were in heaven. Just a great recipe. Thanks so much!

I've been baking bread for over 40 yrs but never have baked a simple white bread. This is the best tasting white bread. Hands down, the easiest recipe to make. My husband nor I found this bread too sweet. The only thing that differed from the instructions was the 2nd rising. It took a little over an hour for the bread to rise 1" over the pan.  They baked beautifully but stuck to the pans which were well oiled. I believe it's because I baked them in Corning Ware loaf pans. I'll try (as others have suggested)several different ways to use this wonderful bread recipe: half honey wheat,dinner rolls,cinnamon raisin. Thanks Peg for a GREAT reicpe!!

This is a very forgiving recipe! Not only did it live up to what other reviewers have said, but I made some very silly mistakes. First, I forgot the sugar. So I just mixed it right into the dough I had made. Second, I didn't roll it out before letting it rise the first time. I followed all directions after that. It turned it out beautifully. I made this over the weekend. I did as some suggested and cut the sugar by 1/3. It was still very sweet! I also only made a half-batch because I had bought 3 loaves of bread not two days before I tried this recipe out...I just couldn't help it when I read all the raving reviews! So I divided the dough in half (1/4 the recipe at this point) and formed one piece into a loaf as is and the other I pinwheeled cinnamon. I baked both in the same 9x5 pan as directed. Both mini loaves were devine!

What a wonderful recipe! I cut down the sugar by half becuase I wanted a less sweet bread for sandwiches. It's amazing. The texture is fabulous and still has a nice very slight sweetness in the background. Thanks to all who recommended this one!!

This bread's texture is PERFECT.  I noticed others said they had trouble, but I really think in order to get good bread, you MUST have three things:  1. A good mixer; 2. Fresh yeast; and 3. BREAD FLOUR. My only suggestion is that the bread is pretty sweet.  Next time, I'll cut the sugar at LEAST in half.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper for sure!  Thank you so much for sharing it!!!

So good and very easy.  Dough is very sticky and took more than half an hour on the second rise, but we loved it.

The best bread and easiest too. It only takes one bowl and you knead it twice. Very easy quick and so delicious. Tastes like you took all day to make this bread. Great recipe.

Very soft, which I love.  I think next time I'll try a little less sugar, I prefer it a little less sweet.  However, kids and I devoured 1 loaf before it even cooled down.  I didn't get it to rise above the loaf pan to see if I could get it "store-bought bread shaped", where it forms over the edges of the pan, but taste is what matters.

Yup, the other thousand people who gave this five stars were right - it is awesome!  I half it in the bread maker and it always turns out amazing!  I have even added 1/2 c. bran (we need more fiber in this house) and it still tastes great!

Very good!  I made it in the bread machine (only 8 servings because it's small) on the light crust setting and it was great.  I didn't have regular sugar so I used brown sugar, but it still worked.  I cut the amount of sugar by about half and was just right for me.

This recipe is worth  a solid four stars, I would have given it a five but I think there is still room for improvement. My family loves this bread, I guess I am concerned about the amount of sugar that it requires.

Wow! Unfortunately I used this bread for stuffing. I did have a taste before continuing with the stuffing recipe and it was so good. I can't wait to make it again for sandwiches.

Okay. So, this was my first time making
a homemade white bread that wasn't a beer bread. You can imagine my combined excitement and anxiety. 

I can't take credit for my efforts entirely. Thank you to breadguy who posted his method of making this bread with the Kitchen Aid mixer. Totally saved my life, let me tell you. Using his advice, I was able to make this bread
with a little less freaking out about messing it up. 

I wish I'd read up more about cutting back on the sugar. It is a bit sweeter 
than I would have liked. Next time, I'll be sure to cut back on the sugar. Other than that, there were no other hitches. This bread worked out perfectly for me 
as a first time bread baking experiance.

I can make great rolls and sweet breads, but haven't had any luck with actual "loaves" of bread.  This recipe turned out spectacular- Didn't find it dense at all like some other reviews stated.  Light, slightly sweet and super yummy!  Husband and kids ate an entire loaf in a sitting!

The flavor is good. Sweet and I will definitely cut the sugar next time. Unfortunately, my bread didn't turn out correctly. It was super dense.I don't know much about making bread, this is my first time. But I think my water wasn't warm enough and same with the temp in my house. I am trying this again before the weekend is over.I really want to learn to make homemade bread!

Ok so this was the first time I baked bread. I've helped others but have never been in control. I actually used 1 cup of whole wheat flour for every 2 of unbleached white. Other than that I kept everything else as is and it turned out beautifully. My mother should be proud!

I like this recipe a lot. I use this dough for other things as well. My family finds it to be a really nice treat. It is funny when you make bread with or without a bread maker how impressed everyone is. This is such an easy recipe, if everyone knew how easy it was there would be more people making their own bread.

I make this bread all of the time.  It has become a family favorite.  Easy recipe for those who are not expert bread makers like myself.  I use my kitchenaide mixer with the bread attachment for the kneading portion, and it saves me alot of work.

This bread was extremely sweet.  I would have envisioned a much less sweeter bread to use for toast and jelly.  While it at first was appealing, the sweetness quickly became overpowering.  I probably will not make this again but it was well worth a shot.  I value all the bread-making experiences that I get.  I now know that I prefer less sweet breads.

A very sweet bread- amazing with pb&j. =)  
Also makes the perfect tasting sweet dinner rolls. 

Lessen the sugar to under a cup for a less sweet 'every day' type bread.

Very nice recipe.  I used this bread to make thick cut french toast and it was a major hit.  Plus there is no dairy so my son is able to eat this bread as well!

Since I couldn't find bread flour, I used all purpose flour and add 2 Tbsp of wheat gluten.  Best bread ever!!!  I have a lot of nigerian friends and they said that this bread reminds them of home.

This bread is great! Light and airy! Perfect the way it is.  I've made this bread quite often (I make 4 loaves at a time) and it's always gone within a few days.

This was my first attempt at making a yeast bread and it turned out very good! My family loved it.  I thought it was a little sweet- it will probably make good toast. I'll try it again but cut back the sugar a little.

I have been searching and testing for the perfect bread recipe. Wow I was blown away. This was a fantastic bread. I will definitely make again. I made them into rolls. I loved the sweetness. If I make it for others I might cut back a little on the sugar but it was the right amount of sweetness for me. My husband raved about this bread. He kept going back for more. This will defintely be made again in our house.

I scaled this down to 12 servings and made it in the bread machine, it didn't rise as much as I would have liked(which is more than likely my fault!), but it didn't hurt the flavor at all. Great toasted with lots of butter. Will use over and over!

My 12 year old son made this for school for extra credit in science, how yeast works etc... It was so easy and unbelievably  good, no great!!  He used less sugar like recommended, the texture, the flavor was as if we got it at a great old time bakery!! The whole class loved it, there was none left!! Today, he is going to make it for Sunday dinner at Pop-pop's.  He is going to make garlic & basil and garlic & parmesan cheese bread.  That's right were Italian-"American".

I love this bread recipe!  (I cut way back on the sugar though.)  I like to roll it out and add things to it, like onions, pepperoni, and cheese; then roll into a loaf and let it raise the second time.  You can add herbs to the flour as well, and make it into any flavor of dough you want, very versatile recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

I tried this recipe using the dough setting on my bread machine, and then letting it rise again in the pan and  cooking it in the oven for the recommended amount of time....it turned out wonderful. We had it with the Split Pea Soup (from this site) and there it was completely gone at the end of the meal. Using the bread machine made it that much easier. Thanks for a great recipe...you can't beat homemade bread!

I made this bread with 21 first graders and they all absolutely loved it.  It was very easy to make, I allowed them all to take turns in measuring, adding to the bowl and stirring.  They all kneaded their own loaf and I watched as they baked and took them out of the oven. 

I tripled the recipe and it made 25 mini loaves of bread.

Thanks,
Lisa Shumaker

I thought this bread was excellent.  I added just under the 2/3 cup sugar that was called for, and I didn't think it was too sweet.  I also added one cup of white whole wheat flour and it was good, but next time I will add at least 2 cups and see how it turns out.  Great recipe!

This was my first time making bread and the flavor was really good.  I liked the sweetness but it may not be for everyone.  With that being said, if you're trying to make traditional white bread, you'll definitely need to decrease the amount of sugar.

I've been making this bread for 7 years now.  I have received so many compliments on it.  I usually substitute 2 cups of wheat flour for some of the white flour.  I also use about 1/2 cup sugar instead of the whole 2/3 cup.

I love this recipe.  I have tried many recipes but this one is full proof for me. I adjust the amount of sugar when making a savory bread such as a garlic rosemary, or leave as is when making cinnamon rolls or brown sugar raisin bread.  This one does it all.  ITS GREAT.

Awesome!! I'm a novice baker. I followed this recipe down to a science.This bread is sweet and very filling. Maybe cut down on the sugar like everyone else next time. overall VERY NICE BREAD. I used 2 packages 8oz of normal not quickrise yeast, still turned out fine. Also for people who are new like me.. if your wondering when the yeast is "proofed" the foam it looks like poridge or rice pudding and step 3. I think is crucial because I didn't use quickrise yeast... I timed it 30 min. it wasn't even near risen.. I took a chance and decided to wait till 1 inch above the pan... finally approx 1h:45 min. later the results payed off!! ***** stars!

Love it!  It was looking for a nice, light, white bread recipe and this is it.  I used less sugar (1/4) and it's perfect.  We've made it a few times now and it's a staple around here.  Thanks!

Wonderful Bread.  Made with 1/4 cup sugar.  Yummy!  My husband raved about it and son (2) shoved it in.  Will try with full amount of sugar next time just to see what it is like.  Thank You!  I have again made this with the full amount of sugar and it is still so yummy.  For sandwiches I will use the 1/4 cup sugar.  But it is yummy no matter what.  To me this is a stupid-proof bread.  Yeah!

I've made this recipe about 8-10 times and it has comes out perfect every single time.  The only regular change I make is I use olive instead of vegetable oil because I don't usually have vegetable oil on hand.  Works just fine.  We use this as our regular sandwich bread for the week.  About half of the time I use half wheat flour and I always just use regular all purpose flour, never bread flour.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's a definite keeper.

LOVED IT!!! My family loved the fresh baked bread. I did however leave it in the oven for 5 more minutes because the first loaf was not as light and fluffy due to under baking... I will make this recipe again!

This is a great recipe. I have been looking for an easy great sandwich bread. I used less sugar. I use the bread machine, to do all the work. Then I bake it in the oven. Thanks for a great recipe.

This bread is so delicious! I've tried so many bread recipes and this one beats them all!!  Will definitely make again (probably every day). Thank you so much for the recipe. I have a Kitchen Aid mixer and I'd like to thank breadguy also for the great tips for using that with this bread. Per the other tips I cut down on the sugar, but that's the only thing I changed. I love it!

I've never made bread before. This was great. It wasn't difficult and it tasted really good. I did most of the kneading with my KitchenAid mixer. I did use less sugar, as some suggested, 1/4 cup. Next time, I will use the 1/2 cup.

Wowza! My first time making a "from scratch" yeast bread. I'm eating it as I write this, and all I can say is that it reminds me of the first time I ever ate homemade bread, that my now deceased grandama made. She was from Pennsylvania, which is Amish country and the reason I chose this recipe. Thanks for the recipe.....and BTW, I used half the sugar that was called for.

First loaf of bread I have ever made from scratch and it came out perfect.  I did halve the sugar and it was lightly sweet.  A friend of mine accused me of buying the bread somewhere.  A great bread recipe!

I am very happy with this recipe. In half an hour I can have this dough rising and then I'm off doing other things. This morning I was gone three and a half hours before I got back to the rising dough. Punched it down put it in bread pans and went on to another project. You can't do anything wrong with this recipe. It comes out great all the time.

It is the best and reliable bread recipe.
You can use it to make buns, cinnamon buns, or just perfect bread.

I use this recipe for dinner rolls and monkey bread, too. I halve the recipe and use the breadmaker for the dough if I want something other than a loaf, or leave it in and let it go...so good warm with butter! Very easy to do. Consistently turns out softer/lighter crust in my Dak breadmaker than in my Oster, but either one is still a winner!!!

Delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe said to and it was yummy and pretty easy.  I didn't think it was too sweet.  I like it that way for breakfast toast.  My kids gobbled this up.  I made it twice and froze the second loaf for later.

This bread was delicious!!  I let it rise for quite a while before punching it down (3 hrs.) and then again in the loaf pans and it came out perfect.  Not heavy or dense but still that wonderful taste of homemade bread.  It was very easy to make, too.  I used my dough hook on my kitchenaide mixer which took care of the kneading so no elbow grease was necessary.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is my favorite homemade loaf bread of all time. I printed it to make back in Nov. 2006 and have made it so many times. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. It is Easy, fast and O'so good. It not only is good to eat as is, but I use it for bread crumbs (great for fried foods to meatloafs). Also it makes the best French Toast I have ever eaten and that includes Restaurants famous for breakfast. Thank you Peg for a great recipe.

Very nice and the directions previuosly mentioned for a kitchen mixer worked out very well.  I have made it three times, one with all the suger, one with half sugar and one with 2 tblsp sugar.  I personally liked the half amount of sugar.  I prefer my bread a little sweeter and that amount was just right.  I honestly wouldn't attempt it without my kitchen mixer though, it saves a lot of elbow grease!!

This bread was fantastic, and super easy.  I'm pregnant and was craving homemade bread and this totally hit the spot!  Just a hint of sweetness, and moist as well.  I used Unbleached all Purpose Nutri Flour blend which is a mix of White flour and wheat bran.

My first loaf of bread! And it turned out awesome! For some reason I have always been fearful of making bread or baking in general. With regular cooking, if you mess up you can correct your mistake. With baking it's like once you put it in the oven, it's a done deal and if messes up there isn't much you can do. This recipe has taken away my fear of baking. This was a really easy recipe to follow and the results turned out so great. For those like me who are on the timid side when it comes to baking, have no fear with this recipe.

Very good white bread. Baked mine for about 25 minutes and that was perfect for me. I like a light crust. Will definitely make again. Next time want to try making it cinnamon swirl bread....

I let my breadmaker do all the work!  After the cycle had finished I put it into 2 loaf tins, let it rise, then cooked it.  It was delicous and so easy!  Will definately make again.

I hadn't made bread in years but tried out this recipe today. It was super easy, came out just perfect! I did scale it down so that it only made one loaf instead of two. Next time I make it I plan to turn it into cinnamon bread. Can't wait!!

This bread is good, but rises extremely slow, possibly due to the amount of sugar in the recipe, which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  You just need to account for that if you're planning to have it for dinner.  In addition to making great sandwiches, it makes wonderful french toast.

DELICIOUS! I had never made homemade bread before and this was my first recipe. My children loved and and want me to bake it everyday! It's easy for beginners. I have also started using a 50/50 mixture of sugar/splenda and 50/50 oil and applesauce. It tastes great and is a lot lower in calories.

Most of the time I try something that has a lot of great reviews, only to find that it didn't live up to the hype.  Throw all of that out the window when trying this recipe.  If there were 10 stars, I'd rate it that.  I've made this bread over and over and it's delicious every time.  I asked my husband to get bread at the grocery store and he brought me home yeast instead.  I asked him why.  He said that he would rather have the homemade bread and he's not eating the manufactured stuff.  HA!  I'm sold.  Great recipe...thank you so much for sharing.

This was a great recipe. The bread rose perfectly. The finished loaf was a bit too sweet. Next time i will reduce the sugar like many other people reccomended. To help your dough rise put the whole container in a oven (that is not on) and add boiling water to a container. This time i used three bowls. One underneath, and one on either side. You can also use one large dish underneath or pretty much any other varration.

Great recipe.  Recommend this for a really perfect loaf of white bread.  I make flavored butter (i.e. strawberry, raspberry, honey) to accompany this frequently.

I like this recipe! I changed the flour to wheat flour, and I used 1/4 of a cup of sugar. This was the second time I made this recipe, and this time we didn't have sugar, so I used brown sugar. The first time I made this recipe, I took the bread out right away, and it didn't come out in one piece, but I discovered that if I left it in the pan to cool, it would come out in one piece. I also used dark pans, so I reduced the temperature and the time of the bread in the oven. Over all, this is one of my favorite bread recipes.

very good bread! I changed a couple things though. I used 1/3 cup of splenda instead of sugar and used olive oil to make it healthier. I put all of the ingredients into my bread machine and set it on the dough setting. Once it was done, i shaped it into two loaves and placed it on a baking pan and baked it as directed. Saved much time and it was well recieved by everyone who tried it!

Absolutely scrumptious! During the 2nd rise, I had to leave the house, so I set the pans in the fridge and later took them out while the oven heated.  I rubbed butter on the top when they came out of the oven.  Thanks for the recipe, Peg!

Foolproof!

I was worried with all the sugar that it would be too sweet - but it turned out PERFECT.  This is my first successful bread recipe and I am always getting requests from my family for it.

It goes GREAT with the Smokin' Scovilles Turkey Chili!!

As far as white bread goes, it's right on the mark. Prior to this, I never made bread successfully... now I know why, I never used nearly the amount of sugar seen in this recipe. If white bread is what you're after, this is the recipe for you. However, truth be told, given the 'health' issues surrounding white bread, I probably won't make it again.

This was the best bread I've ever tasted.  I've not had much success making bread in the past, but this was simple and delicious.  I used self rising flour as it was all that I had on hand and it came out wonderful.  The family devoured one loaf right out of the oven!

I bake bread a lot, and this is one of my all-time favorites! It turns out perfectly every time. I double it and make it in my 6-qt. Kitchenaid mixer. It freezes beautifully.

This bread is perfection. Better than bakery bread, it's slightly chewy, a little sweet, and just dense enough to be used in a wide variety of recipes. I made half into a loaf of bread, and the other half into 8 medium sized rolls.
I used all-purpose flour with a mix of raw sugar (about 1/3 cup) and brown sugar (1/3 cup) with a tsp of honey, and suprisingly the sweetness is very subdued. It just tastes like an expertly made bread, which is amazing for a novice bread baker like myself.
The crust is perfectly browned, and my house still smells amazing many hours after the baking is done. A forgiving dough, which allows for minor alterations, while still producing excellent flavor and texture? I'm sold! This is now the standard white bread in my house. Thank you so much!

This is a very tasty recipe.  It was easy and looks good.  I found it didn't rise as much as I expected (I make bread all the time so I know).  I also found it dried out really quick if not covered right away.  Other than that, great bread :)

I've been making my Grandmother's bread for 25 years now and it always seems like something is missing..I figured out what it is...This Recipe! This bread is simple, perfect consistency, simple, slightly sweet, simple, DELICIOUS and, oh ya, did I say SIMPLE! I've finally found a toast that tastes great without butter! Oh my gosh....I didn't even have to use my KitchenAid mixer to stir it up. I will make this bread over, and over, and over, and over......  :)  Good stuff!!

I love this recipe!  It makes a very dense, slightly sweet loaf.  I use 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1.5 when I want a less dense loaf that's better for sandwiches.  It's also very good if you add a pinch of cinnamon or some orange peel.  It makes great cinnamon swirl bread, too.  Great recipe!

A few weeks ago I posted a 5 star rating for another white bread recipe on this site that I said was the absolute best.  Well, when I'm wrong, I'll admit I I'm wrong.  Intrigued by the hundreds of 5 star ratings for this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  Since it's just my son and I, I halved the recipe and threw everything into my bread machine and set it for basic white bread with a light crust.  A few minutes into the first knead, I checked and did have to add almost 1/3 cup of water.  I checked after the first rise and had the sinking feeling that this was going to be yet another failed bread recipe.  OHMIGOSH WAS I WRONG!  When the beeper on my machine went off, much to my surprise I was looking at the most perfect loaf of white bread you can imagine.  I was even more surprised when I tasted it and deemed it better than Sunbeam!  Needless to say, my son awoke this morning to a huge plate of french toast and claimed it was the best he ever had!  Try this recipe....it's a keeper.

Only one little, minor, eensy weeny problem that I believe was caused by the bread machine.  While the density of the loaf is wonderful, it was a bit "holey".  I wouldn't say the nooks and crannies were quite like an English muffin, but the next time I make this recipe I will use the custom setting on my bread machine and follow the knead and rise times given in the recipe more exactly.

I don't know how you could mess this recipe up. This is the easiest recipe for white bread that I have made. I added green food coloring for St.Patrick's Day and the kids loved it. For Easter I'm going to make yellow and pink bread. This recipe is now my number one white bread recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I have tried this recipe quite a few times, and each time the product has been wonderful.  If you like a less sweet bread, cut back to 1/2c on the sugar. I have tried it both ways, and the bread works well.  Makes great Toast!!

This has a great texture, but I like the flavor of my ol' standby bread recipe better. Perhaps I'll try it again with less sugar.

Besides the rising, this bread is easy and the end result is unbelieveable. My kids and husband have been eating it all morning. My new favorite bread recipe, thanks.

It was okay but not the best.  It tasted great warm and with butter.  It was pretty dense and one slice felt heavy and filling, so I thought it was too much for someone watching weight to be used for sandwiches and such.

I did only use 1/4 cup sugar and was glad of it!  The bread turned out beautiful and I agree with the user who said it tastes like a Hawaiian Sweet Bread.

I've made this several times now, and it has been delicious every time.  It is a little sweet, so I don't think it would be great for sandwiches or garlic bread.  However, it is perfect for slathering with butter and/or toasting.  This is one of the easiest and quickest yeast breads I've ever baked.

It was good, my husband (not a big white bread fan) said it was great for bread and butter but a little too sweet for sandwiches.  Will  definitely make again.
thank you

This is my first time in baking a bread and it came out fine. I don't know if we get bread flour here in India so I therefore followed 2 earlier reviews and used all purpose flour and wheat flour. It was quite easy and my husband really loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was incredible!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and didn't find it too sweet (not as sweet as portugese sweet bread, but sweeter than your standard white...)  Thank you so much - this will be a staple in our house from now on!

This is such a delish. recipe. This is the only bread recipe I have ever made and although I am willing to try other recipes, this one is my favorite. It always turns out great and perfect. It tastes a bit yeasty but after you put butter on it or toast it, it tastes great. A keeper recipe.

This bread is the best white bread I've ever baked. So soft and delicious. I will probably cut down on the sugar a bit next time but its great as it is. I highly recommend this bread to people who have never made homemade before. Its easy.

Very good basic bread recipe.  I was looking for something I could use for sandwhiches and this worked well.  It also seems to be a very forgiving recipe.  I thought I'd used too much flour (was still less than the 6 cups it calls for) and was preparing myself for dry bread as the end result.  But it came out beautifully!  I was very surprised.  I'll be making this again.

I first got this recipe way back when all recipes was split into several sites and it is sooooooo good.  I recently had a chance to visit the Ohio Amish country and the bread really did taste like this!

I got this recipe as a newlywed and my husband and I have been enjoying it (maybe a little too much) for 7 years now.

Yes, this bread was fantastic and easy.  I halved the sugar like everyone recommended but I think I'll use the full amount this next time.  I would have enjoyed a sweeter bread.  Great recipe!!

I just tried this recipe and it is wonderful.  I also substituted the maple syrup in place of the oil and only used 1/2 the sugar. The cooking time did take a bit longer than suggested, by 8 minutes more.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe, my family really enjoyed.

Not light enough for me, and also I wasn't a fan of the flavor (still a very strong taste from the yeast). But if that's what you are looking for then it should be rated 4.5 stars

Fantastic and easy bread recipe!  This is a great bread for mornings, nice and sweet, and PERFECT for french toast!

The second batch I made I added 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon to the mix and it was even BETTER for french toast!

I love this recipe.  It's quick and easy to make plus it's delicous.  I to cut the sugar down by over half.  The loaves were perfect, the texture is great, not grainy and coarse rather moist with a great crust.  I also used this to make whole wheat bread by simply replacing 3 cups white flour with whole wheat flour.  Both the white and the whole wheat freeze well without losing any taste or texture

This was the best white bread I have ever had.  I will use this recipe over and over.  I have been searching for awhile, and finally found it.  Thank you.

This is a wonderful white bread.  Slightly sweet, very soft and just a little chewy.  I found the texture a bit coarse with just one rise, so I cut the yeast back to 1 Tbsp., and let it rise twice before putting it into pans.  I find this bread rises much faster than the published time, but I make bread several times a week, so I have a lot of wild yeast in the air in my kitchen.  I also like this bread made with half White Whole Wheat King Arthur flour

This is one of the best white breads I have ever made. I have made it for 2 years now and it has become a staple in our home. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup but when I use honey I leave it at 2/3. This a dense sweet bread with a good crust. If you find it to be a little sweet you can cut the sugar back as far as 2 table spoons and the bread is still great just not so sweet. If you follow the directions you can't lose.

Thanks

This is a great, versitile bread recipe! I scaled the recipe in half to make just one loaf because there are only two of us in my family. I made my boyfriend the Awesome Egg Salad with a Kick recipe from this site and served it on this bread. It was a knockout! I did take other peoples advice and cut the sugar in half. The bread was still slightly sweet, just perfect. I was so proud of my loaf! This is only the third or so time I have ever made bread from scratch, and I find it very rewarding!

I make this recipe all the time.  It's my standard bread recipe.  I do decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup and use brown sugar instead of white.  I also use whole grain flour just to make it slightly better for you.

Excellent bread.  I just threw everything in my bread machine and it came out perfect with a touch of sweetness to it.  It went well with Baked Beef Stew from this site.  Thanks

This bread recipe was the first that I've ever made and it turned out perfect. I expected it to be more sweet and soft, but maybe I need to adjust the cooking time or something. It is sweet but a bit yeasty. Again maybe that was my fault as this was my first attempt ever. I was scared to bake home made bread after hearing horror stories from my friends and family, but this recipe was so easy. I give the credit to the recipe and not my baking skills. I'm not sure if it will be my favorite bread recipe as I haven't tried any others, but it is a very good recipe and I will be keeping it for future use. Thanks so much for sharing it.

This is the most sucessful bread recipes I have.  It always turns out, easily makes great sandwich rolls and is delicious! It is a sweeter bread but that is what makes it so great!  Tastes like what we brought home from Amish Country here in Ohio.

Absolute perfection! For those of us in high altitutes, I added a heaping 1/4 c. flour (I used self rising and got rid of the salt), and I upped the temp by about 15 degrees, using an egg yolk/water wash before baking. I let the yeast set for a really long time (say 38 minutes) and it was the first bread I've ever had turn out well way up here in the mountains. Thanks for posting it!

Way too sweet for me.  I was expecting sweet, but not that sweet.  The texture was ok if you like your bread a little more dense.  If I try it again I will use maybe 1/4 the sugar.

This bread would be good for dessert rolls and the like, but it did not keep more than a day and tasted a little too strongly of yeast.

I am a notorious bread making oaf.  This recipe was so easy!!!  I let the bread rise for almost two hours the first time then for a bit shy of an hour on the second rise.  They ended up perfect.  They never rose over the pan but I think that my loaf pan is a bit bigger than it should be.  The bread was a bit dense as well, next time I'll let it rise for longer.  I also felt that the vegetable oil addition added an odd taste, it can be considered good by some, but next time I'll melt butter and use that.  This is the first time my bread has come out edible and I am ecstatic.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! One thing though: My bread seems to rise A LOT in the oven...much higher than the picture. But it's an excellent bread...slightly sweet, very moist, and just the right density. I used it for Make Ahead French Toast submitted by Debbie Tate on this website. I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand, so I used extra virgin olive oil and the bread still tasted wonderful. I bet it would be great for toast, sandwiches, everything. Thanks for sharing this one!

By far the best bread recipe I've made! It smelled so delicious baking we ate it straight out of the oven and burned our tongues. :) Adding jam seemed to take away from the great bread taste. Very fluffy, soft, and delicious, even 3 days after we baked it! (didn't last much longer then that!) I brushed melted butter on the top of one and honey butter on the top of the second and the top crust burned just a little so I would recommend putting foil on at some point if you try that. I baked it in stoneware loaf pans and had to decrease about 5 minutes of the baking time. Definately going to make this again soon!

I cut the recipe in half to make only one loaf (12 servings).  Very easy homemade bread to make for a beginner baker like me.  Came out great!  I will try doing full recipe next time and do one cinnamon raisin.

I'm rating this recipe on simplicity and flavor. In my opinion it wasn't like a white bread that you would use for sandwiches.  It was more of a sweet bread that you would serve at meals with butter.  It was a heavier yeast bread, but soft and moist.  It might make good dinner rolls.

This was my third try at bread.  The first two recipes turned out lousy, and I thought I'd give it one more shot.

This bread turned out perfectly.  A fantastic, sweet, soft white bread.  Absolutely amazing.

I made one loaf as a 'cinnamon swirl', and the other was plain.  It's so good that you don't need to put anything on it!

I'm going to try to make one with less sugar, and toss some cheese into the center.

I enjoy trying new recipes, and this is certainly simple.  However, I substituted 3 cups of white flour, 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups oatmeal for the 6 cups of white flour.  I let it raise a little longer than recommended because of the denser flour.  The bread came out really moist and tasty.  We ate it warm from the oven with soup. I will certainly make it again.

Super!  The user who thought this would make good french toast was right on.  I had company and made up a batch of this by hand, using the instructions from a previous commentor, which worked great and was very easy.  One loaf I made normally, and the other loaf I turned into a cinnamon swirl bread.  I mixed cinnamon and brown sugar, and added oil until it was spreadable.  I rolled out a rectangle, spread a thin layer of the cinnamon mixture, rolled it up, and cooked it in loaf pan.  The next morning we used it for french toast.  HEAVEN!  It was the best french toast I've ever had!  And the regular loaf was great for dinner, and I didn't think it was too sweet.  I making it again as we speak, and I can't wait.

Excellent bread!  I've never had bread turn out so good as this loaf did.  I scaled it down to 12 servings (1 loaf) and it's really very good.  I did cut back on the sugar slightly as per other posters.  This will be GREAT for sandwiches!

This recipe makes a good specialty bread, but it is too sweet for basic white bread. I've tried cutting the sugar in half, but with just water and oil, there isn't much else going on in the way of flavor.

This recipe is fantastic! I had a lot of fun making this. The bread was nice and light with a very nice taste. It didn't taste yeasty like some other homemade breads. I baked my bread as the recipe directed (for exactly 30 minutes at 350 degrees) and was delighted to see that the bread had a light golden brown crust. It wasn't heavy and thick as the crust that you would get from an automatic breadmaker. The only thing that I did do differently was cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. I also brushed the top of the crust with margarine to soften and bring out the golden color of the crust. My house smells so wonderful from this bread.

One of the best bread recipes I have!  I love the sweetness of the dough and how high the dough raised.  I've made it twice so far.  It is especially good warm out of the oven. mmmmmm

This was the first time I have made bread (with yeast) from scratch, it came out perfect and delicious.  My family loved it, and they have requested for me to make it again!  It almost resembles the taste of portuguese sweet bread, but much more dense.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread is sweet and tasty, though it tends towards overbrowning.  I'd suggest using an oven thermometer to be sure your temperature is correct and adjust the temp down if necessary if the first loaves are too dark.  Reducing the baking time just gives half-baked bread.

This bread was so good, I finally had to stop making it since I was eating a loaf a day.  ;-)

Wow, awesome recipe. This recipe has an average rating of 5 stars for a reason. This is only the second time I have made bread. It's perfect. I used this recipe to make buns for my husbands lunches. The amount of sugar is just right (as we like a bit of a sweeter bread) I will definatly be making this for the rest of my family. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've been baking bread for over 30 years and this is the best white bread recipe that I have found.  Being a bit of a zealot about good nutrition, I substituted one cup whole wheat flour for the white and the results were superb!

WOW!!!!! I've been making homemade bread for the last 13 years...always looking for a better recipe. THIS is the best bread recipe I have EVER made. In fact I am eating it right now as I review this. It was very easy to make. I made it before bed and let it rise once, punched it down and put it in 2 greased loaf pans. Then I stuck it in the fridge and in the morning it had risen just perfectly. I stuck it right in the oven and out came the most beautiful, tender loaf of bread I have ever made...THANK YOU!!!

This recipe is so easy and it doesn't take all day to make. It is the only bread recipe I use anymore - for loaves, buns and pizza crust. I sometimes substitute 2 cups 12 grain flour for 2 cups bread flour. After experimentation, I have settled on 1/4 cup sugar which I dissolve in the water before adding the yeast. The bread never crumbles so even my kids can cut it. They love it for sandwiches and just as a snack.

This was my first attempt at making bread. I listened to most of the comments and cut the sugar to less than half, but the next time I make it I will put the 2/3 cup as I wanted a sweeter bread. I also will add a bit more salt. AND I've decided I want a bread maker to do the mixing (very tired arms)! Otherwise the bread came out wonderful! This is a DEFINATE keeper in my recipe box! THANKS Peg for sharing!

This is by far the easiest bread I have ever made.  It is also one of the tastiest.  When ever I make it, I give one loaf away and keep the other because it makes up so fast, I can always make more.  This one has become a permanent addition to my recipe book.

After the "thousands" of excellent ratings, I must mine! I recommend cutting down on the sugar. Another variation: form into french bread loaves on large tray that has been sprinkled with cornmeal. Spritz the oven with water before putting in the loaves, and again once or twice during baking. Gives a good chewy crust with the tender center.

I'd been itching to make some homemade bread lately, stumbled upon this recipe and tried it.

It was easy to make, and very easy to eat! I shared with my family and we all agreed it was some of the best bread we had eaten.

The more solid body of it and light sweetness makes it a real winner over any store bought brand.

I highly recommend it as others have.

I have never baked bread before - it seemed so daunting a task - this was quick, easy and tasty. My wife and I ate almsot an entire loaf - first with jam, butter.... NOTHING beats fresh bread. I will bake this again

This was the first rising bread that I've ever tried to make from scratch. I followed the recipe to the letter, and didn't even mind the sweetness that resulted from the sugar most reviews suggest decreasing.
The loaves did take longer to rise, but this could be due to the Denver altitude. This bread is awesome!

I was invited to a friends house for dinner so I thought I'd bring a nice loaf of bread. The process kept me up late (Istarted late at night)but it was totally worth it!  The first loaf was gone within minutes of dinner starting. (I was secretly mad at myself for bringing both loaves.)  So there I was, baking bread again the next day.  Made one loaf into raisin bread and it was "toast" (sorry about the pun) after breakfast.  The only change I made was cutting down on the sugar.  Nothing better than homemade bread that actually turns out!  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at making bread.  The bread was pretty easy to make but I should have taken the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar a bit.  I thought it tasted great with butter and honey on top but to eat alone it was a bit too sweet.

This was my first ever homemade bread and it was a huge success.  If I had more loaf pans, I'd double the recipe every time, it goes so fast at my house.  I like it just the way it is but I might try it with less sugar just to see.  It makes me feel good to know that I can make bread from scratch that's so yummy.

Really wonderful, I added cinnamon and raisins to the dough, then I rolled it out. I then added a mixture of cinnamon, butter and sugar rolled it back up, then baked it. Wow!!!! Made a great cinnamon swirl bread.

Don't use so much sugar.  It tasted sweet,and we aren't used to that sweet taste in bread, although when I put Marmalade on the toasted bread, it was great.

Took longer to rise than stated-May have been the weather here. Made wonderful crusty rolls, and I followed the suggestion of using the dough to wrap cocktail weiners with. GREAT. My 4 kids had them all gone in 10 minutes. Will use this recipe again and again. I also cut the amount of sugar used.

Easy & great.  Slightly sweet bread.  I used regular  flour instead of bread flour & makes a hearty loaf.  The first one is almost gone by the time the second one is cool!  Doesn't have that "yeasty" flavor that comes with a lot homemade bread.

This was an easy recipe.  My 4 year old likes to help me cook.  It was a joy to let her help me with this recipe.  Not a lot of ingreds.  I keep my house cool, so the rise time was almost double, but I was pleased with the outcome. Next time I might decrease the sugar for my diabetic father-in-law. I will use this recipe again for bread and can not wait to use it or sweet rolls.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a real good bread, although, I didnt bake it long enough, I had a bit in the center that didnt get done.  I Think my rack was too high.  I will have it lowered next time and will try to bake at 325.  I used a glass pan, is this OK?  My first loaf of bread!  I was impressed.  Im a Dad that needed something for my 2.5 yr old daughter to do, and this was pretty fun for us.  She liked eating the dough, and playing in the flour.

Excellent bread.  My kids would eat the whole loaf right out of the oven if I let them.  I use my dough cycle and then put it in the oven.  It tastes even better than when baked in the bread machine.  Like that could even be possible?!  YUM YUM!

Great recipe, just like others have noted. The bread came out looking like store-bought sandwich bread but tasting like homemade goodness. This one is a keeper in my recipe box. I liked that the instructions were right on and that it is such a basic/starter recipe that can be added to. Thanks!

The taste and texture is absolutely wonderful.  It is creamy, soft and so full of
flavor; I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe!

Being a beginner at baking bread, this was easy and made me realize anybody can make delicious bread from scratch.  And I thought I was a big dog making bread in a bread machine!  The bread machine hasn't seen the light of day in a long time.  I also haven't bought bread at the store in a long time.  Thanks for the recipe.

okay we made this last night, as is, for cinnamon rolls.  Mind you we have an old family favorite cinnamon roll recipe.  Well my 17 yr. old son claimed these were the best yet!  So this will definitely be the recipe for the dough from now on.  I'm anxious to make a regular loaf now!  This is a VERY easy recipe to make!

I'm so happy - I am a beginning bread baker and I just can't mess up this yummy bread recipe! I use my bread machine on the dough cycle, then take it out and divide it into two pans for the 30 minute rising time, continuing as the recipe instructs.  I've made it with varying amounts of the sugar called for with great results each time.  This bread is very sturdy and makes excellent garlic bread - spread with softened butter & minced garlic, topped with Parmesan and cooked under the broiler.

This is awesome!! Crunchy crust and light, soft, and fluffy in the inside.  Finally found the recipe that I will be using. Did it on my kitchenaide stand mixer and it works wonderful. The only change that I made to this recipe is that I only used 3 Tbsp. of sugar. I never seen a white bread recipe with that much sugar. Average recipe is 1 to 3 Tbsp. sugar.  Now my search for white bread is finally over.  Thanks, Peg!!!

Absolutely heavenly. The best bread I've ever had! I can't believe I made it myself. This was my first attempt at making bread and I had to halve the recipe because I only had 1 package of yeast but it still turned out fabulous (if I don't say so myself!). We ate the whole loaf in one night and guess where I'm going today? To buy more yeast and bread flour!! Make this and try not to eat the whole thing yourself!

This was my first time baking bread w/out a machine.  The bread turned out perfectly and was delicious.  It was sweet enough to eat with only butter.  Everyone is asking when I'm going to make more!

Very easy to make, avoids milk or other milk products (people actually put this stuff in bread?!) but much too sweet.

If you want your kids to have a tooth left in their heads, seriously cut down on the sugar.

Do it in your bread machine (but watch the machine's capacity!) - but be sure to add just the warm water, yeast and (reduced) sugar for the first 10-15 minutes. Then add the oil,  flour and salt and select your machine's rapid bake (or near 2-hour cycle)

This recipe replaced my dad's long used one! I like a sweeter white bread, so this recipe was perfect for me.It also makes wonderful Mormon scones! After the first rising roll out half of the dough 1/2 inch thick, cut into squares and fry in hot oil. Serve with honey butter or butter and jam. A family fave! Thanks!

I came across this recipe while looking for a yeast bread to be used in our restaurant.  While we decided not to use it for our main bread, we think we'll use it for holidays.  Instead of making 2 9x5 loafs, we made it into roughly 8, 5 oz rolls.  Don't let the 5oz fool ya, these are very large rolls!! :D  Very good, and very light (you may want to cut back on the sugar though), and very tasty.  Try it, you're sure to enjoy!

I made this bread and everyone loved it. Enjoying experiments, as I do, I decided I would try to add a little to it. Before it rose for the last half hour and after I had needed it, I melted 1/4 cup of butter and mixed together 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup white sugar. Mixing all of these ingredients together, I added a large, chopped apple. Stretching the bread out as far as I could, I spread this mixture over it and then rolled it up and let it rise for the last half hour. When we tasted it, we were overwhelmed with the luscious flavor and texture.

Great bread, and it couldn't get any easier than this! I've always just placed everything in the bread machine for the dough/rise cycle, and baked in the oven. The bread *is* sweet. If I'm planning on using the bread for a savoury meal, I just reduce the amount of sugar. Thanks for sharing, Peg!

We've moved from the Tri-State area, but we love Stroehman's Dutch Country Potato and we can't get it here on the West Coast.  My  7 year old daughter swore up and down this was the bread we used to have in NJ!

I lost my favourite bread recipe and last week decided to try your Amish bread recipe. I have a large family and I am making this recipe several times a week and still can't keep ahead of it! The kids and my husband just love it. One son said last night - "Yeah! Tomorrow I get to get up and have some more bread - YUM!" Another plus - it is so easy to experiment with - I like to exchange honey for the sugar and add wheat germ to it! Fantastic!! Thank you!!!!

This bread was extremely easy to make.  It's also very easy and fun to experiment with by adding different extras, like cinnamon swirled in or butter baked into the crust!  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is the best for toast and sandwiches.  I made it first by the recipe and thought it was too sweet.  
Reduced the sugar the 1/3 cup and it was the best ever and everyone that have tasted it said not to change a thing.  I'll be baking again in the morning.  T. D.

This is now my favorite white bread.  There are a couple things to look out for.  The first and most obvious is my house is cold in winter and I didn't take enough time to proof the yeast.  What this means is that once the yeast is mixed with the warm water (prior to adding the sugar) let it set up and foam a bit.  I let it proof maybe ten minutes and then off we go.  That may not have been long enough.
In any case, you make a roux, just like any bread and the first two cups of flour or so should be whisked in.
DO NOT mix all the flour indicated in the recipe...get to maybe four cups and then add a little at a time until the dough is just firm enough to knead without gooping up your fingers.   Knead it on a floured surface (note I did not say "lightly floured"...)  as it picks up flour, add a little at a time to avoid kneading on an un-floured surface.  You'll get the hang of it.  Knead it for a bit and then put it in the greased bowl (follow instructions).  Mom and I always heat the oven to about 100 degrees (no hotter because you don't want to kill the yeast) so it will help it rise.  DON'T FORGET to turn off the oven before putting the dough in!  The oven rack should not feel hot to the touch, just warm.
If it happens like mine, it was in a warm oven for an hour and barely rose.  This can happen.  So what I did was knead it on a lightly floured surface for a bit, split it and made two loaves.  If you haven't done that before, be sure to put the part where the dough is roll

After trying one recipe after the other (even from “expert” baking blogs”), this one nailed all the characteristics that makes an awesome bread. It’s dense, moist and foolproof. Thank you!

Followed directions - except I didn’t have self rising flour. It turned out perfect! I divided the dough in thirds so that the loaves weren’t giant. My kids and husband love!!!!

I use to make the potato flake Amish bread starter bread.  It was too much to keep up for only two people.  This recipe tastes just like that recipe without all of the "up keep".

I made the bread and we love it.  We cut the recipe in half so I make one loaf at a time, great for two people that do not eat bread at each meal or everyday.

1 cup          warm water
1/3 cup      white sugar
2 1/4  t.       active dry yeast
3/4 t.           salt
1/8 cup      oil
3  cups        flour

dont know yet now its in the oven rising i think , my dough came out very flaky but i was able to get it together  and  without much extra flour at all, so now i wait and see if it rises within the next hour, im really determined to do this bread, see it done so easily on all these videos and i want to make my own bread its so demoralizing  anyway im still optimistic about it i just pray will let you know how it turns out if not i give up altogether

I have made this a couple of times. Always tastes good. The only thing I see different is that they don't rise as much as I would like.

I have tried to make bread for many years. Tried every recipe known to man. I just never had any luck. It was always dense and very heavy. Then I came across this recipe. Oh my gosh!!!  From the first loaf it had always turned out great!!  I won’t use any other recipe and I’ve shared this one a number of times. I am going to try cutting down on the sugar next time and I’m confident it will still be wonderful!!!

I decreased the sugar as suggested by some and it was perfect. But if I want more of a Hawaiian style, I will make it again with the amount on the recipe.  Yummy.

I followed the recipe (metric conversions), although I used a stand mixer with a dough hook and, as is typical with bread, I added more flour as needed to get the dough to the right texture to come away from the sides of the bowl. The baked texture was fluffy and it came out looking just like the photos. 

I just have to take a star away for the amount of sugar in this recipe, though. In the future, I think I'll cut the sugar by at least 33%, maybe as much as 50%. It's just a bit too sweet for my preferences. I have plans to make some French toast with this initial batch, though!

This recipe is wonderful. I cannot drink milk so hardly ever have it in the house. This is so very easy to make. It keeps for a long time since there is no dairy in it. After it is a few days old, I use it for toast. It makes the best toast ever.

Finally!  A high rising white sandwich bread that holds together.  Easy to make.  It could use more flavor, so I’ll experiment with that, but this is now my everyday sandwich bread.

This is my go to white bread recipe. I sometimes use half white/half whole wheat flour. I have made this using AP flour when I didn’t have bread flour on hand. I use the dough for cinnamon rolls. It makes a sweeter loaf bread but our family likes that. Too sweet? Cut back on the sugar. Today I made it and added 3 egg yolks to proofed yeast before adding salt,oil and flour. I will report back as to how that worked out.

Great base recipe!  I use it all the time but add different spices and herbs!  1-2 tbsp mixed spices like oregano, garlic, basil, onion flakes, and chili peppers!  Mix them into the oil before you add it, Very fragrant and nice change.  I also make with whole wheat flour and don’t add the whole 6

This is the best recipe for homemade bread that I have found. Followed the recipe  but cut back on the sugar to 1/3 cup still turned out great without being to sweet. My Hubby loves it and I can't bake it fast enough for him as well as the whole family. It's definitely a keeper.

Just like nearly everyone else, I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS BREAD. It is a little on the sweeter side (imho the RIGHT side) and is a perfect sandwich or toast bread. I was wondering if anyone has tried making it with a sourdough starter. I have some and really want to experiment with it; if anyone has recommendations for how to convert this recipe to using natural yeast your comments would be very appreciated. Regardless, this is now my main bread and I’m excited to try using it as a base for cinnamon rolls.

I make this once a week.  Sometimes I only make 1/2 for a single loaf.  Always using a scale.  If I make 2 loaves, I use the extra 1/2 for cinnamon rolls or dinner rolls.  This is a wonderful base for cinnamon rolls.  I  roll it out, fill, cut and pop in a greased cake pan - then in the fridge.  The next morning I let rise 1-2 hours and bake.  I am then officially everyone's best friend :)

Foolproof! This recipe is so incredibly easy to make. One thing I did slightly different is instead of really kneading after the first prove I just punched the air out of it and shaped it into rolls then allowed to prove a second time for 30-45 min

My friend made the best cinnamon rolls and I asked for the recipe. She gave me this bread recipe and I am scratching my head. She told me she made the dough from this recipe and then rolls it out to the shape of a rectangle spread a liberal amount of butter onto the dough,  sprinkle  a generous amount of brown sugar, roll it up and cut with a string. Let the rolls rise again for another hour in the butter pan. Bake at 350 for 18-20mins. Best cinnamon rolls ever! Don’t forget to make the cream cheese frosting!

This is the bread I always make cause my family begs for more :) I e-commerce a little less flour to make it less dense. I find it doesn’t keep for long but can always be toasted with butter. I started Making double batches and freezing Loads so far so good :) love that’s a bit sweeter :)

Wonderful, quick, no fail bread recipe I make often. Over the years I've tried a lot of bread recipes but this is my favorite! A friend makes it into dinner rolls which are yum. You can't go wrong with this winner!

I have made this several times cutting the proportions in exact half to make 1 loaf.  Comes out perfect every time. I start it in my bread machine through the rise cycle, punch down and transfer to buttered loaf for 2nd proof and bake in the oven. I do find that I need to loosely cover the top in foil about half way so that the top doesn't get too brown. This bread is delicious. Makes out of this world grilled cheese sandwiches.

This is the best bread recipe ever. I always have a problem with other ones being way too dense and crusty but this was perfect. I can actually use it as sandwich bread. I had issues with rising as my oven did not want to hold heat, so it just took longer for both rises.

WOW!  First time bread maker.  Used everything as is and followed the steps as directed, except, I used butter instead of vegetable oil and used three packets of yeast.  Came out PERFECT.  Kids loved it and said they will not eat the store bought bread ever again.  I am pleasantly surprised.

Delicious and Easy.
I reduced the sugar as per other reviews , to 1/3 cup and was great. Next time I’ll use a bit less sugar.
Definitely a keeper.

Thank you!

This was the first time I ever cooked bread from scratch.   I couldn't be more pleased with this bread.  It makes a soft and delicious bread that puts store bought bread to shame.  After reading some of the reviews that recommended reducing the amount of sugar,  I decided to only use 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I also only used about four and half cups of flour.  The bread had a perfect consistency with the smaller amount of flour.  I will be making this again... I hope you have the same results that I have had.

I sometimes add part whole wheat bread flour...and sometimes throw in a small amount of whole wheat flour/spelt flour if I feel like it. The recipe holds up with these changes!  I  have made this recipe at least 15 times and it is phenomenal!

It’s easy and it’s perfect every time! I keep thinking it would make a great sandwich, but it never lasts that long- we gobble it right up! I bake it in a Pyrex loaf pan - the one time I didn’t was the ONLY time it didn’t work...not sure why.

Good recipe. Made it twice (so far). Tastes great. 
It reheats well in the microwave.
As an amateur bread maker, I would simply note that it's better to have it a little too moist than too dry, otherwise, the bread is rather crumbly.

It rose beautifully but did not cook in the center. I tried putting it back in the over for an additional 15 min.

This was my first attempt at bread and it was a complete success. It tastes wonderful with a soft tender crumb. My grandson loves it toasted and has asked to make 2 loaves to take home with him. It will be my start at teaching him to bake.

Absolutely love this recipe! I've seen my mother bake bread, but never in my life have I tried it. I watched the video (a few times) and decided to give my children the same memories of butter on freshly baked bread that I had as a child. What a hit!! I dont have bread pans so had to improvise, and make buns. Soft fluffy warm and sweet, these buns/bread will be made again and again. Just what i was looking for in a bread making recipe!! So happy with this recipe and proud of myself

Very easy bread and fast to make.  As others have noted it is extremely sweet -- my first thought when I tried a slice was that this would be good dough for cinnamon rolls.  But it also makes a good sandwich bread.  I used it for meatloaf sandwiches and between the savoriness of the meatloaf and the tanginess of the mustard the sweetness of the bread was perfectly balanced out.  Another bonus, this bread held together really well  for the sandwich, instead of crumbling apart as many white breads do.

Perfect! I made two loaves and then two small "French bread" brushed with garlic butter. Went perfect with the goulash I made for dinner while the bread was baking.

First time making bread. It is quite sweet. Very yummy. I didn’t poke it like the video so a nice smooth rounded top. I found it was a little dense, even a little doughy, inside not sure why could be something I did. But very proud of finished loaf and I will make it again

AMAZING!  I’ve been baking bread in my bread machine for years.  This is my first attempt at making it in the oven.  I was a bit nervous but wow- no need to worry.  This recipe was easy and quick to put together.  It turned out perfect!  As far as the sweetness goes, I think it’s really a matter of your own taste buds.  It definitely tasted like King’s Hawaiian bread to me. But others said they didn’t think it was sweet.  Guess it’s whatever you are used to.  It’s so delicious!  I will be making this recipe regularly from now on.

I made one change with  ingredients ...I used locally produced coconut oil instead of vegetable oil... I made a change in size of loaves by separating 1/4 of the dough to make 6 dinner rolls in a muffin pan. The remaining 3/4 of the dough is devided  into 2 equal sized parts for the two loaves; necessary for my smaller loaf pans. I prefer the slightly smaller loaves as I love bread and eat so much of it!  The smaller pieces are less calories ....so I tell myself! LOL!

I've made this twice now and my second batch I used 2 packs of yeast instead of one, with one packet the bread didn't rise much. Holy hecc did it rise. It made a great fluffy bread, I love it. Thanks for the kitchen aid tips, they worked great. Will be making this every week!

I made this recipe as directed, but one small change. I used my Kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook for the first kneading. It worked out well. The bread was so easy to make.  I will be continuing to make more.

This was my first time making this recipe. Although it did turn out to be delicious, it did not rise as much as I had hoped. I will make it again and hopefully next time it will rise as much as it did on the video.

This is why I'm rating it five stars:
The description was "easy, doesn't take long to make." It fits that description.  It wasn't the most amazing tasting bread I've ever baked - but it isn't supposed to be.  This was a good sandwich bread that my picky family ate when they make sandwiches.  My wonderful sourdough goes stale; my delicious challah doesn't get finished, but this went, two slices at a time, from right to left as they ate lunch. (And yes, as I snacked)

The crumb came out moist and light as air.  The crust was very soft, which they like.  The dough was easy to bring together and pleasant to knead.  I gave a loaf to a friend, and he and his gf loved it. 

And it didn't take all day to make.  I'll be making this one again - not to show off with at a potluck - but to show love to my fam.

I made one loaf into cinnamon raisin bread and one plain. I love this recipe. It always comes out good. Though if you use all purposes flour it is denser.

This is my new go-to bread recipe. I no longer buy bread at the store. The only change I make is that I only use 1/4 cup of sugar, and I usually only need about 5 cups of flour. I have tried this recipe with normal sugar as well as coconut sugar and it turns out great either way. I typically do one loaf of bread and do cinnamon rolls or dinner rolls with the other half. Delicious!

Awesome! I used bread machine yeast instead and skipped the proofing part. I used the same measurements for the quick rise yeast and it worked perfectly. Just mixed it right in with the flour and started kneeding. Very dense and rustic - would be awesome as French toast or just as it is with soup or stew. I'm actually going to use this recipe for making bagels. The dense chewy texture would be perfect! It seemed to be browning too quickly, so after 15 minutes, I turned the temperature down to 350. Next time I'll just bake it at 350 the whole time.

Amazing! We used half of the dough to make a bread loaf, a quarter to make rolls, and the last quarter to make cinnamon rolls. All were perfect!

Excellent recipe and so flavorful.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and it took on a butter like taste.  The two loaves are almost gone.  I made this yesterday.

I used only 1/4 cup of sugar. The rise time on the loaves in the pans is not 30 minutes, its around an hour to get it to be 1 inch above the pans. but with that being said the bread came out good.

Just a few months ago I decided to start baking , including homemade breads. This was the third recipe I tried and it turned out well, but a little dense. I recently went to make a batch but was low on bread flour so I instead used 3 cup bread and 3 cups all purpose and it turned out even better. Next time I think I'll try 2 cups bread and 4 cups all purpose.

I made it according to the directions. The kids seemed to like it fresh from the oven but not the next day. It came out very dense and heavy. Next time I will tweek it a bit and follow the advice in the other reviews. Not a bad tasting bread and easy to make. I think the second loaf will make some really good croutons.

I've never made bread before so I wanted to start with something simple, and this is the best bread I've ever tasted! I did use canola oil instead of vegetable oil, but it came out sweet and fluffy and was overall amazing

I am one that believes to rate a recipe you need to make it exactly the way the poster wrote it first. Then review it then make your changes and then post it as your own. It gets me so mad when I see a 5 star rating and people go on and on about all they changed. You are giving you and the recipe you created with your changes a 5 star rating. Not the original recipe. Okay. I'll get off my soap box.

As you can guess, I made it exactly as written. And it needs no changes. It is wonderful. Very, very flavorful. It taste amazing. My first piece was still warm from the oven and I just put butter on it. Delicious. My second piece I put strawberry preserves on it. Majorly delicious. Third piece I toasted it and put butter on it. It was a explosion of flavor. This was my first attempt at making bread. I am now hooked. My mom always made bread when I was a kid. Smelling this brought back so many memories. Then when I punched it down after the first proof, brought some more. That is one thing my sisters and I were allowed to do and would fight over it. I will be making a lot more bread. The next one that my mom made a lot was raisin bread. I am on the hunt for a recipe. I so wish I had hers.

Wonderful rich bread. I even used older yeast just to use it up,  made bread sticks to go with spaghetti,  brushed with a mixture of melted butter, olive oil,  garlic powder, Italian seasoning and parmesian cheese.  Wonderfully rich. Normally I only make potato bread but have found another one I'll use.

It didn't look like the picture. It was dense, not fluffy. I made 1/2 the recipe & cut the sugar like reviewers suggested. Initially, that was the only change made. Adding a cup of flour at a time, it only took 2c & it was feeling kinda dry. While flouring the surface to knead, it may have taken another 1/4 cup. My yeast was really frothy before I added the salt, then flour, so I dont think that was the problem.  I can't say it was "the best" but it was still good bread. I'll try again. Might double the yeast & might try adding milk as another reviewer suggested. I wonder if buttermilk would make this more delicious.

This is an awesome tasting and easy recipe, I make it just about every week and we use it for breakfast every morning and for most of our sandwiches.  I highly recommend you give it a shot.  My only criticism, if you can even call it that, is that it is a little on the sweet side.

Love this bread. It is my foundation bread recipe. Simple and fairly quick as bread recipient go. I usually brush the tops with butter for the last 5-10 minutes and then again right out of the oven. Great with butter. My wife says even better with honey butter.

I made a single loaf, and halved everything with the exception of the sugar. I didn’t want a sweet loaf, so I knocked it back to 1/4 cup. The loaf came out beautiful, and the texture was superior to any bread I’ve ever had. It was velvety soft, and stayed soft for several days. I have just one negative comment: I used 3/4 of a tsp of salt per the recipe, and the loaf really needed more salt. I wondered about it when I was putting the ingredients together. Three cups of flour is typically a 1.5 pound loaf, and the standard amount of salt for a loaf that size is one tsp. Once I buttered the bread with salted butter it was ok, but just cutting a slice and eating it you definitely noticed it lacked just a little something. I’ll absolutely make this beautiful bread again, with just an extra 1/4 tsp of salt.

So quick and easy to make and absolutely delicious. I've personally found the loaves rising time takes closer to 45 minutes.
 A Kitchen Aid Mixer with a dough hook really helps things along. However if you have a tilt head you may wanna half the recipe. if you have a lift bowl the recipe fits in fine. Either way, still add the flour cup by cup or else you get a dusty mess!
This recipe is delicious and works with any meal.

Amazing!!! I, however, do not like sweet bread. All I do, is use half the sugar and double the salt and it comes out perfectly

This is too good for it's own good.  I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfect.  Oncw out if the bread machine it did not last the day.  I can tell this will only be for special occasions because it will ot last.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I divided the dough and did a loaf of bread and cinnamon rolls with the other half. The cinnamon rolls turned out amazing!! Perfect base for cinnamon rolls - not too chewy but also not super doughy. However my bread ended up with a huge top and a HUGE air pockets in the middle. Not sure where I went wrong with these - I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, and I DID use all purpose flour, so that may have had an impact. I also may have let the bread rise too long for the second rising - more like an hour and a half than 30 min (and I didn’t punch it down again, maybe I should have). I’m going to try again for the bread since the cinnamon rolls turned out so well.

Great as a sweet base bread. I've adjusted the recipe to incorporate spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, as well as roll-type fillings such as coconut, etc. and it has turned out delicious every time. Good for novice bakers!

Amazing! I used all purpose flour and I used one less cup of flour and about half a tbs more yeast (used packets). I also didn't have any bread pans so I just shaped the loaves and baked them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. They came out as beautiful golden brown loaves with a nice crisp to the crust and a soft springy inside.

This bread is awesome! So easy to make, and so good. I read the reviews after I had already starting making the dough (whoops), so I was a little worried about the sugar, but it turned out well. It’s definitely on the sweeter side, but no sweeter than typical sandwich bread. My only comment is that it was tricky to tell when the bread was done, since I don’t have a ton of experience with yeast breads. 30 min seems about right, though.

I lost all my recipes, cookbooks, everything in the Camp fire of 11/08/2018 and have been wanting to make bread.  I chose this one and it came out very tender and light.  I used 1/2 the amount of sugar stated and it came out fine.  Really fine textured and delicious.  My husband liked it and said it was a keeper for sure!

It took a little longer for my dough to proof, probably because i didn't disolve my sugar well before adding the yeast. I made one big wide loaf, it's just like average white bread. I gave 5 stars because it was easy and turned out great!

Good recipe! Forgot how my mother taught me, so this helped immensely!
First round, I forgot the oil: bread came out a bit firm and hard, but that made it good for a soup.
Second time I applied some butter, added a nice soft crust.
Third I switched the white sugar to brown, again buttered. Gave it a tad more flavor.
All-in-all, good recipe that's nice and simple. Definitely will be using this again.

I've made this bread 3 times so far and everyone who had tried it has really liked it. Its very, very sweet (too sweet, imo) so I've cut down the sugar every time since the first. I highly recommend using bread flour instead of all purpose and only add 4 or 5 cups to start. The recipe calls for 6, but depending on your flour and humidity level and the position of the moon, sometimes you'll find you need a lot less. I usually end up using just over 5.  I also sprinkle a little salt on top of the shaped loaf before I bake it. 

If you're looking for a savoury bread, I'd skip this. Even with the reduced sugar, it's still a sweeter bread - kind if on par with those little Hawaiian rolls (in terms of sweetness, not flavour). Its absolutely delicious with butter as a snack but I probably wouldn't be using it for sandwiches or garlic toast.

This was my first try at making bread. The structure seemed to be good but I was really unhappy with how sweet it is. It’s almost as sweet and Hawaiian bread which is not at all what I was wanting from a white bread. I will use this recipe again but will cut back on the sugar.

I love it! My kids, my Mom, my neighbors, and co-workers loved it. Here are my notes. I have been making bread for about 25 years now. YOU MAY NOT NEED ALL THE FLOUR LISTED.  Measure the flour out into a separate bowl. You add the flour one cup at a time until the dough forms into a ball.  Use the flour that you measured out to flour the surface,  dump the dough onto your floured surface, sprinkle flour, from the bowl onto the dough and KNEAD! Add flour to the dough after it absorbs in and knead.  Keep doing that until the dough is elastic and not too sticky. I did not use all the flour that  I measured out. The bread is not dense at all, but it is a little sweet for my taste. I will drop the sugar to 1/2 cup the next time I make it, and I will report back.

I first mixed it in bread machine ( I have that thing going every single day ) I followed the recipe exact , even though I thought I had a bit too much sugar , I still like to try all recipes exact when first making . This bread rose beautifully,  it was a bit more chewy than I expected & I would prefer less sweetness ( my preference , not my husbands ) . We still both loved the bread , but I prefer the Portuguese sweet bread on this site a bit more ( if adding sugar ) I'm looking for a good dense enough sandwich bread for my son & husbands lunches & even though this bread is good , I feel it may get a bit soggy by lunch time if I use mayo etc ... but we will see tomorrow!

I'm glad I looked at the comments before I made it to add the correct amount of sugar. This bread tastes amazing and I will now have to have it around my house at all times

Love this recipe, but it always needs  40 minutes in the oven. And yeah, could be the temp of my oven, but other things I make are fine with recommended times. Just a little FYI.

This is my "go to" for bread. It always turns out for me - my family demands it at holidays or whenever they can get it.  I do reduce the sugar to about 1/2 cup - but that's it.  PERFECT!!!

Added this to my baking repertoire and have to say it's a breeze to make and more satisfying to eat. I checked reviews here and reduced the sugar by half and subbed butter for oil,  keeping everything else the same. Just delicious. Thanks for this!

Really good, but a bit too sweet. The second time I made it, I cut the sugar to 3 tablespoons. Much better. The third time, I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, and 4 cups AP flour. It was delicious! Light, airy and flavourful.

This is the perfect bread. I baked half fresh and froze the other, and while the second one was still really good, it was a tad less sweet, as the yeast had more time to nom the sugar. I'm going to just keep this bread on hand as our every day bread, because it's that good.

Absolutely perfect, both in a loaf pan, or on a cookie sheet. Adding some steam to the oven gives it a soft, shiny crust perfect for sandwiches or on its own. One of my favorite bread recipes.

This is my all time favorite white bread recipe!  I have been making it for years and when my kids were little, they learned how to make it as well. Only change, I use half the sugar called for. Less sweet and turns out perfect every time. I let the bread rise in a bowl on top of my warm oven.

I have several problems with this recipe. First, it doesn't state how long to let your yeast bloom. Not everyone is a yeast whisperer. Secondly, the recipe asks for you to put the salt directly in the yeast mixture. This is a mistake. Anyone familiar with working with yeast knows that salt can slow the chemical reaction in the yeast and stifle rise. It also doesn't state how long to knead the dough or if you should flour the work surface. It also doesn't mention if the loaves should be covered for their second rise.  I make bread all of the time, at least once a week, and the lack of these kinds of details are the main reason why bakes fail. I've got these loaves in the oven right now, after allowing an hour for the second rise, not the 30 mins in the recipe. They wouldn't rise well, and I discovered that this is likely because a skin formed on the top of the loaves from being exposed to the air. The skin inhibits the bread's rise and will result in a denser, smaller loaf. Not what I'm looking for when making sandwiches bread. I will not be making this again.

Wow! This bread is amazing!! I've been looking for a whole wheat bread recipe but haven't liked any of them. Thought I'd try a white bread recipe and sub in 1/2 whole wheat flour, we have a winner!! It's so tender and fluffy and tastes SO GOOD! My changes were I cut down the sugar as others have suggested and substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour. Absolutely fantastic! Will definitely be making again and again. Thanks so much for a great recipe. :)

Tastes great, cuts nicely (my serrated knife has seen better days, and it even cut well).  Had it as toast with butter and eggs this morning, very tasty!  I typically have challenges getting it right when working with yeast and kneading but this bread dough turned out perfectly.  I do think the trick is allowing the yeast to proof.  I mixed in a clear food processor so I was able to see the sugar and yeast working together, and resurfacing as foam.  I will use this recipe again and may try it as a dinner roll recipe when I need to.

I loved this bread, it was delicious with the soup I made and our family ate an entire loaf! I would however reduce the amount of sugar next time for a less sweet, fluffier loaf. Definitely a keeper!

The bread itself is delicious, but for some reason the bake time is WAY off for me. Every time I've made this loaf it takes more than an hour to bake. After 30-45 minutes I turn it out of the pans and set the loaf directly on the oven rack to brown on all sides. The last time I made it I went to turn it out and it collapsed completely! I love this bread but if you're looking for a quick bake this is not it!

A perfect white bread for making of all things tasty.  Good structure and still fluffy.  I've shown great discipline for not eating it right out of the oven.  Holds it's moisture.

Made this for my first attempt at homemade bread since I was in Girl Scouts. It is very easy BUT one thing to note if you make in winter- make sure your house is on the warm side. My bread simply refused to raise until I set it on top of the pre-heating oven.

I made it just as the recipe calls for. It turned out really well, but I am going to cut way back on the sugar next time. I thought it was a little too sweet, and my wife is type 2 diabetic so she has to be careful with the carbs and sugar. 
Other than that, I really do like this recipe. Very easy to make!

Absolutely delicious. Easy to make. If you want a tighter bread that more resembles an airy pound cake, just let it rise for half the time. 

All my kids loved it. That says it all.

My family loves this bread!  Two loaves lasts 2 days!  I throw everything into my bread maker on the dough setting.  Once it’s kneaded, I follow the directions from splitting and flattening, jelly-rolling, and letting it rise in loaf pans before baking in the oven.  When I do this, I use the instant yeast.  I’ve also tried this with Gold Medal AP flour, King Arthur’s AP flour, and good quality bread flour.  The bread flour was the lightest and fluffiest, but our preference was the King Arthur.  And I found that if I let it rise in the pans long enough, they were just as light and fluffy as the bread flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first loaf of bread I have made other than in a bread maker. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and it turned out perfectly. All four of my teenagers ate it up like it was candy! Thanks for the great bread. It will surely be on my weekly menu!

I make this bread at least once a week.  I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the oil to 1/2 cup. I get rave reviews from anyone who has received a loaf from me. I will never buy bread again.

Delicious! Truly perfect bread.  I used 1/2c sugar, and it made it perfectly sweet, yet I’d use the full 2/3c if I likened a sweeter bread. This recipe made ONE loaf, because I like tall bread, which it made the perfect sandwich size bread. A keeper recipe!

I have made this exactly as written. My house is a little on the cool side during the winter, so I heat up my oven to 350 F and let the bread dough rise on top of the stove (not in the stove, that would kill the yeast).  I cut the loaves in half and only keep out half at a time, as they get crumbly really quick, within a day or two. It does also make great bread crumbs when it gets a little stale. Nice recipe.

Everyone in my family really loved the bread. Iused my bread oven to mix and knead the dough.
I'm going half the recipe. So I can just make a single loaf

I halved the recipe and used the dough setting in my bread machine. I then gave it a light knead, formed it by rolling, put it in the sprayed loaf pan and let it rise another 40 minutes, then baked as instructed. OMG, this is the best white bread I have ever tasted! Will definitely be making again and again!

I have been making bread for many years and I am constantly on the lookout for good recipes to add to my "keeper" book. This bread  comes out of the oven beautiful every time. There is only one problem.....My wife just cannot wait for the loaf to cool before giving it her taste test of approval!

My go to recipe for bread. Recipe is great as it is, it is adaptable to your personal tastes. You want less sweet, drop sugar. My family likes the sweetness but prefers a pinch more salt. This has been my staple recipe for many years now. So many, I don’t even need the recipe anymore. I would suggest using large loaf pans so you get the fluffiest result.

This is the first time I ever made bread and on the second try, it was pretty good.  Off to more challenging recipes.  First attempt failed for lack of rise on the first proof.   Thank you for helping me make my first loaf of bread.

I have made many loaves of this bread.  It comes out perfectly every time. It's my husband's favorite. It makes awesome French toast also. I had never made homemade bread before I found this recipe because I remember my mother making bread, so I was a bit intimidated. This recipe is so easy, and foolproof.  It will be the only bread recipe I use.

I just made it exactly as written today. I was worried when my dough didn't rise as high while in the bread pans as the directions said, but they still came out tasting amazing (more sweet than store- bought bread) and were very beautiful. I've never made bread before and was a bit nervous about results. Thankfully, the directions were easy to follow. I also plan on gifting the bread as part of a gift basket with homemade jams and jellies from this site.

This recipe is a keeper! I read others reviews and I use 1/2 cup of sugar and still sweet, and soft.  I add an egg wash and that give more color, is a simple recipe but perfect.

The recipe stands on it's own, no changes needed.  Measurements matter!!! I've made this several times and it's great.  I change it up once in awhile and use olive oil for a different hint of flavor.

Tried it with all the sugar since I thought my yeast might be a little weak and it was delicious, but maybe too sweet for everyday bread. Made it again with half the sugar and that was good too. It's definitely an easy recipe.

I have been using this recipe for many years now.  It is the best bread ever. Also I have taken this recipe and substituted two cups  of whole wheat flour for two cups of bread flour and made whole wheat bread. I also use this recipe for my cinnamon rolls.

My wife has been using this recipe for a couple of years and it has been the best bread ever!!!  I've even made it myself with ease.  Our favorite thing to do is to cut a heel off right after it comes out of the pan, slather with butter and ENJOY!!!

I don't have much baking experience, but I do cook quite a bit. I had a taste for some homemade bread and saw this recipe and decided to try it. This is the best tasting bread I've had in a long time. Of course, homemade bread is always better anyway. The recipe is very easy to follow other than I weigh my flour whenever I use flour. (Bread flour = 4.83 oz. = 1 cup) Will definitely make this again  & again.

This recipe is FABULOUS!! I made this dough twice, once as dinner rolls. Cut the sugar down to 2 TBS-they were nice and fluffy and not too sweet. Second, I made this dough into cinnamon rolls with the suggested amount of sugar and they were PERFECT! This will be my go to recipe for cinnamon roll dough. Can’t wait to actually make loaves of bread. I will probably cut the sugar down when making the loaves of bread.

This bread is delicious and simple!  I used coconut nectar instead of sugar for the yeast, and used all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  I’m definitely keeping this recipe handy for the future.

Made this bread lots of times. Best bread to make for beginner bread makers and best tasting white bread. It's always a hit amongst friends and coworkers. Totally love it and easy to make. Just remember to knead the dough for about 10 mins to get the glutton activated or it'll be a little tough and won't rise as much. Took me a couple times to get it right. Love it.

Followed recipe and used my KitchenAid mixer.  Used White Lily flour, fresh Red Star Active Dry Yeast, and bacon fat drippings instead of oil.  (My southern side had to make it in there somehow.  LOL)   Bread came out great and was delicious.  I will try using less sugar as suggested in other reviews to see how it turns out.

I was a little leery about making this as some had commented it was way to sweet. Not the case at all. It does some have some sweetness, but nothing like Kings Hawaiian bread.

It rose great, but was a little denser than I was expecting..

I have tweaked this recipe a bit to mitigate the consequences of my fiancée's allergies. Using honey instead of sugar adds a bit of flavor. I've baked this recipe 5x in the past month, making rolls for breakfast and a side for lunch. They are light and don't have the weight of store bought bread.

Very simple recipe for a novice breadmaker like me.  A bit too sweet, though - if I make this again, I'll try it with about half the amount of sugar.

This is the first bread recipe I have ever tried so I was not sure what to expect. Everything went smoothly until it was time for the loaves to come out of the oven. They looked beautiful but were very raw inside. I continued to bake them until I essentially gave up. I won't give up the recipe though. I'll take into consideration what others posted in the comments and try again!

I sped up the rising by using my oven since I was pressed for time, but it came out just fine.  I still need to work out how to smooth my dough a bit, but the result was quite tasty.

Excellent recipe!  Instead of 2 loaves, I made 1 loaf and 1 pan of cinnamon rolls. Delicious!

very easy to  make!! Turned out excellent! chewy throughout. crunchy top. I stirred in the flour just enough to ball it. I think that is the trick; do not over work the flour in, and then knead. I will definitely keep this recipe!! Husband and I both loved.

I loved this recipe. I over kneaded it slightly so it was heavier than I expected, but that is my fault not the recipe’s. I am absolutely making this again.

First time I made this bread Many months ago it turned out first try and it was amazing. I have now tried 3x and it's not turning out! I'm so angry because it's some of the best bread I've ever had! It's not rising!

I changed vegetable oil to conola oil
Changed sugar added to 1/4 cup or 1/3 cup
Use only pillsbury bread flour 

The original is great but was to sweet for me and I decided to use a healthier oil

My family loves this bread. It is very sweet, as I would expect from the amount of sugar in it. I found it to be very similar to bread that I have been served at Amish restaurants, which is exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly before baking. However, once it was done baking, I spread a very small amount of butter and honey over the top to give it a glaze as soon as it came out of the oven. Then, I placed it on the table while still warm along with a little softened butter and Apple Butter.  My children (ages 7 & 9) loved it! Perfect addition to a home cooked meal. Thank you!

My first time making bread and this was delicious! I used all-purpose flour and it still turned out great. I took the advice from previous reviews and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. Will be making this a often in our house :)

Oh my gosh I cant stop eating this bread! At this rate I will have to make another 2 loaves because the first 2 will be gone in 24 hours! Do an egg white wash on the top of each loaf before you bake them :) it helps brown them and gives them a delightful crunch :)
*this is now the THIRD TIME I have made this bread in 24 hours! With our first 2 loaves disappearing and my making 2 loaves to share with the neighbors, my family is begging for more!!! I absolutely recommend this recipe now haha!

Nice gentle crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. It’s great out of the oven with butter, cold, or toasted with butter or peanut butter.

Love it.  I do reduce the sugar to a half cup and substitue a tablespoon each wheat germ, oat bran and vital high gluten flour for same quantity of bread flour.  Makes it a tad more healthy I'm told.

I had a hankering for some bread and wanted to use up some flour. I forgot the sugar but it still worked out just fine! Easy recipe and the loaves rose up nicely in the oven. Would definitely make again.

I love this bread. Both loaves were gone in less than 24 hours. My household won't let me go a day without making it now. It is perfect for daily baking. I have already passed this out to a bunch of friends to try. There is one thing I did differently. I used honey instead sugar. I used the same measurements with the honey as it called for with the sugar. It was perfect. Before I made it, I read the reviews on it. If you follow this recipe...every single step, as required, you won't have any problems with density. It does taste a lot like hawaiian bread, but it is not too sweet. It is perfect for sandwiches, with a meal, or just on it's own for breakfast. I have been making bread most of my life, and can say that by far...this is the best I have found in years.

My little brother & I made this bread, it turned out pretty good.   For a softer touch, I put in 2 cups of white flour and let it rise over night and then the next morning, I put in 2 cups of wheat flour. Also, I added 2 packs of yeast at different times.   It’s nice and fluffy.  Tastes good.   We’re Mennonite so we have had Amish style bread before and it is good.  Thanks for posting this ?? recipe!

Amish must have different measuring cups.  2c water (16oz) and 6c flour (25.5oz) results in a sloppy, wet, mess.  Probably added at least another cup of flour kneading.  I haven't even baked this yet and I hate it.

I add the salt in with the first cup of flour rather than with the oil.  I use EVOO and it gives the bread a great flavor.  Also, I increase the salt to 1 TBS. as I find it tastes better.  But the best tip I can give is that I mix it all in one bowl using a Kitchen Aid hand mixer with dough hooks.  I mix it for 5 minutes exactly and get an amazingly silky dough.  Also, use butter for the bread pans instead of oil and the loaves will pop right out.  For fun, I sometimes add ground flax seed, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds.  Very delicious plain or with a little 'fun' added.

Perfect bread for the beginner. Didn’t knead enough? No problem. Second knead to our into loaf pans will fix it and the dough is more pliable then. I have never had a bad batch. Our family has been using this recipe for years now. No one has had a bad loaf. The bread browns up perfectly as well (a problem with other recipes). I have also replace our Hawaiian dinner rolls with this bread by dividing into rolls instead of loaves. Thank you thank you for this wonderful recipe.

It definitely is not a bad bread; actually quite good, in fact. It is kind of dense, but homemade bread is always more dense (at least in my experience). If you want the bread to taste a bit more like white bread, just add a bit more salt. This bread is great as a breakfast toast of fresh! But it is definitely not a regular white bread if that's what you're wondering.

As far as breads go, this is a very simple recipe.  I cut the recipe in half because our freezer is full and we can't eat two loaves that quickly.  

Next time, I'll cut the amount of sugar a little bit, more for health reasons than anything else..  I thought the sugar gave the bread extra taste,  texture and added dimension.  I did have trouble with it rising.   Instead of the one hour the recipe calls for, I waited two hours.  I also lit my oven for a minute, shut it off, checked to make sure it wasn't too hot, and put the bread in for the first rise.  Also, on the second rise, I waited one hour,  not the 30 minutes that the recipe suggests.  For those that are having trouble with this recipe, give it more time to rise,  and definitely watch the amount of flour.  Mine did not take the full amount, more like  2.5 cups.

My husband has thryoid cancer and on low iodine diet. This recipe is perfect for him all l did was use honey for the sigar, and no salt.
He really likes it, and he does not eat much bread but he really likes this bread

Great bread recipe! I’m a total newbie at baking bread, but I got the urge to try my hand on my day off, and this was one of the recipes I chose. It’s a lovely, sweet bread with a dense, chewy texture. Perfectly moist, too! I didn’t have bread flour so I used all-purpose and just kneaded it a bit longer to develop as much gluten as I could, and I accidenally added too much yeast, but that didn’t seem to affect anything but the rise time.

I substituted half of the water for milk.  Used melted butter, not oil. I was able to use the dough setting on my bread maker for the mixing and kneading.  Then took it out of the bread maker to raise in a bowl.  Recipe makes fantastic bread.

Me and my 4 year old made this bread. We broke the "bread rule" , made half  the recipe and baked it in a cake pan for 20 minutes...it still came out very well. We love this bread. My 4 yr old says "it is soft and fluffy and I love it". Thank you very much, peg.

I've made this bread many, many times and have passed it down to my granddaughter.  Both our families love it and so do our friends.  I don't ever have "bread flour".  I use organic all purpose flour.  I knead by hand for about 5-6 minutes the first time and about 2 minutes after punching down. I also bake it for 40-45 minutes instead of 30.  I test with a thermometer. Internal temp needs to reach  200 degrees.  Be sure to use the right size pan as it can affect the outcome.  This is a fantastic recipe and sure beats paying over $5.00 a loaf for store bought organic bread.

Love love love this recipe. it's my go to recipe, and most of my modified recipes are based off of this one. I make it as is, with raisins, and sometimes sub in half whole wheat. I've never managed to mess up this recipe, so id say it would be a great place to start, for anyone new to break baking

The loaf had a good crumb, but was fairly soft, and might not hold up to using for sandwichs. It was a good looking loaf, and i'll make it again, but that was way too much sugar. I was concerned with the sugar before I made it, but always like to try the recipe as written, the first time. The next time, I'll use 3 talespoons of sugar instead of 2/3 cup.  All other measures were about right.

Yum! My family is enjoying it right now!  I’ll make it again. It’s on the sweet side, but we like that. I turned it into 5 mini loaves. Probably could have made 6 given how much it rises. Takes just as long to cook.

Soo good! I'm new to bread making, and have tried a couple of recipes that didn't turn out well at all - dense, heavy, etc. I just tried this recipe and it's perfect and fluffy and just how I wanted it. I made it as is, although it took a little longer to bake than the recipe said. It's a new (to me) oven so it probably isn't the right temp. In the future I may reduce the sugar as other reviewers suggested - not that it isn't delicious, just that I probably don't need that much sugar. I made one regular loaf, the other I rolled flat, sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar, and raisins, and rolled up to make a swirl loaf. Fantastic!

I enjoyed this bread a lot. Based on other reviews I was afraid this would be too sweet, but it isn't at all; the sweetness is there but it's not going to offend anyone. It has a good flavor overall and tasted amazing with some peanut butter for a snack--my husband and I destroyed over half a loaf in five minutes. 

My bread did come out a bit too far on the crumbly/soft side, but I didn't knead for long enough and even noticed when I was putting the loaves in the pan that the dough didn't look quite ready. When I make this next time I will knead for much longer.  I will be looking at how this bread keeps over time.

Ok, so we didn't have any sandwich bread so I decided to try and make some. I didn't have bread flour or even regular flour so I used self rising flour. I also don't own bread pans.. So, I used a square bread pan with parchment paper in between the loaves. It came out perfectly.

The bread gods have smiled upon me on this day! Absolutely delicious. I woke up this morning and randomly decided I wanted some fresh bread and used this recipe. Its sweet and the outside is just crusty enough. I can't believe I successfully made this on my first try. Note to anyone else, use the metric measurements for more consistency.

It was easy to make and quick.  Used about 1/2 cup less flour than called for.  Is sweeter than regular white bread.

First time around the top crust turned out crispier than I like (blasphemy when it comes to homemade bread, I know), but wrap some tin foil around the pans and bake the loaves for 35 minutes instead of 30, and it turns out perfect.

I made this bread, and it was so simple and delicious that today I'm making it again.  I followed it nearly exactly, except I do not have bread flour, so had to use all purpose flour and it still turned out great!  It tastes wonderful with butter, or as a base for sandwiches, or just plain. I live in China and miss fresh bread so much here, and now I'm thrilled I have the capacity to make my own when I want it.

This is amazing! I cut the recipe in half now because the first time I made it as written I had sooo much dough that I made a loaf of bread, cinnamon rolls, and dinner rolls. This is my kids favorite bread as of 2018

I have made this recipe over 100 times. I use it for 2 loaves, or about 36 rolls. I usually halve the sugar to 1/3 cup. Sometimes I will replace 2 cups of the bread flour with white whole wheat flour. It turns out lovely every time.

Made it with 2 TBS of sugar and it was a hit! We like the less sugar which makes a more fluffy bread.

I've made this bread a few times so far, and it will be added into the regular rotation! Instead of 2 loaves, I usually make 1 loaf for sandwich bread and use the other half to make cinnamon rolls. The sweet bread is perfect for both applications. As others have said, this bread dough is a sticky one, which is variable with the humidity o' the day, so don't be taken aback if your dough is as well. I've only had to add additional flour once. Using a scraper to help you get it together is recommended if you are doing everything by hand.  When kneading, I'd suggest you keep an eye on the timer and the other on the dough. When it's ready you should be able to pull a corner between your hands to "window pane" test it.  If you stop too soon, and the dough still breaks when you pull it in your hands, it hasn't gotten itself together enough for a good rise. You should be able to pull on it to get the dough thin enough to see through in a small spot like you are "looking through a window".  Best of luck, and happy baking!

This is so good I want to cry. Made it AS IS. Light, fluffy, wow! NOT too sweet as others have mentioned. I thought it had a hint of sweetness, but certainly was not over-sweet by any means. I LOVE how high this bread raises! It's truly a fun bread to make. The kids will not only love eating it, they will love watching it rise, and punching it down. I love another reader's tip to turn the oven to 350 for ONE minute, turn off, then put your dough in the oven to rise. It definitely rises much faster in this environment. (Just be careful that you only warm it for a single minute!). This recipe was soo good that I am making it again today to give to moms in the neighborhood this Mother's Day weekend.  P.S.  You'll never buy store bought white bread again.

I made it following the recipe. It only used 5.5 cups of flour. I had no bread flour, only regular flour. 

As I was reading the reviews, I realized that this is the bread I grew up with. It's actually made with a starter. Once you get it proofed, you can add things like nuts, honey, and dried fruit to it. It's a wonderful bread, meant to be sweet and dense. If you find it too sweet, you should look for a regular white bread recipe.

I made one large loaf, one small loaf, and 6 rolls with this. And used 2 1/4 tablespoons of yeast. Came out super yummy and light! I also mixed it with my hands only. Only machine used wasy oven. I proofed it for one hour, kneaded and divided, then proofed again for 30 minutes.

The best bread recipe with the most consistent results! I free-form the loaves and bake on cookie sheets, they end up cooking in less time and seem to prevent larger bubbles compared to when I bake in a loaf pan. Don’t over-handle the dough after the first proof- it will create a dense loaf if you do.

My children loved this bread.  Love it.  It's soft and keeps for longer than five minutes (unlike bread from my bread maker.)  We've been playing adding cinnamon to the dough, or rolling it out like a jelly roll, filling with cinnamon and brown sugar and rolling back up and baking.  It's very good!

For sandwich bread we have downed the sugar to 1/2 cup or less because it's too sweet otherwise.

We've made this four times already and will make more!!!!

I like this bread. HOWEVER: be aware that it comes out really sweet: I can almost taste the sugar while eating the bread with nothing on it and I followed the recipe to a T.
Now, I enjoyed it because I use it for toast with butter or jam and it works beautifully, and because I love the dense texture. But I wouldn't recommend it as is for savory sandwiches.

I always use this recipe however, I make mine in a bread machine. I add the wet ingredients first and use the 2 pound setting on the dough cycle. When it’s finished mixing, I divide the dough into two bread pans and bake as stated in the directions. I also brush the tops with an egg wash which makes the tops absolutely beautiful. Love this recipe!!

Really easy recipe. Makes a good bread. I prefer whole wheat bread over this recipe. But for a budding breadmaker, this is a great way to learn.

I made it adding milk instead of water and an egg. Also I did cut down on sugar after reading several reviews since I wanted this bread for sandwiches. 
It came out delicious and spongy but the crust is a bit hard, not like your typical store white bread but not rustic either.
Also used 5 cups of flour only and the dough got the right texture. Baked it for only 25 minutes as it was already light golden. After applying butter to the crust it turned a beautiful darker golden. Will make it tonight again for tomorrow's breakfast.

I have made this many times and love, love, love this recipe. I make it whole wheat too. This last time I used part whole wheat, 1 cup of mashed potatoes, 2 T coconut oil, 1 egg and 1/2 of sweetener was Stevia in the Raw. Excellent taste and texture.

Other than reducing  the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested by other reviewers, I followed the recipe exactly. I found it took a little longer to bake to 190° internal temperature, almost 40 minutes but of course this could just be my oven. The end result was just ok, with a mild and pleasant taste but a rather dense texture. Think I'll be trying  a different recipe next time.

I’ve cooked many times and it generally turns out great. I round up the yeast to 2T and rise time to 90 minutes and love how it turns out. I made with “All Purpose” flour once and it didn’t rise well and turned out too dense. However it turns out perfect with unbleached bread flour.

I've done everything with this bread. Loaves, dinner rolls, cinnamon rolls, rolled around a meat and cheese filling, you name it. It's never let me down. Change up the flour to whole wheat? No problem. Brown sugar instead of white? Great.  Follow a proper knead, rise, punch, rise protocol? Perfect. Throw everything in a bowl at the same time and ignore it? Still perfect. It's the most forgiving bread recipe I've ever tried. I've even had it rise chilled. Only caveat...make sure your yeast is fresh!

I gave this recipe a 4 star because it was a bit sweeter than I'm use to. when my grams and i use to make  it together she must of used less sugar. This recipe didnt turn out too bad considering it was the first time I made bread by myself. it turned out more dense then other home made Breads I've had, but I don't know if that was my error, the yeast I used, or just the way this recipe is due to the fact i have minimal  experience at bread baking.

This was my first time making bread and I followed the recipe exactly. The bread was easy to make and came out sweet and somewhat dense; like other reviewers have said something akin to a denser Hawaiian Sweet Roll. Overall a delicious (and vegan!) bread that is good toasted, buttered, plain, and makes as a great side or as an ultra-luxe sandwich bread. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I just made this and the flavor is amazing!  My only mistake was to not oil my pan well enough.  The bottom stuck to the pan and stayed in the bottom of the pan.   I guess we'll just have to eat it quickly, which won't be a problem!  I took someone's advice of freezing half of it before the second raising period.  I'll definitely change the rating to 5 stars if more oil to coat the pan (as the recipe says) fixes my mistake.

Good, simple recipe, I like to use it as a starter when I experiment :
adding small can of plain pumpkin, 
basting with pineapple juice before baking,

I make 3 loaves instead of 2, because 2 loaves do not  cook right in my oven.

My grandson calls this the worlds best bread.  Partially because he helps me make it when he comes to visit.  Like a lot of the other people reviewing the recipe I have made some minor changes, depending on what I am baking and for whom.  I have reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and substituted 1 and 1/2 cup of wheat flour for the bread flour and was still very good.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count. It has been loved in our home for years-requested for every special meal we have and by many friends. I have made loaves, mini loaves, and (most often) rolls. People often think you have to have a “roll recipe” to make rolls-no, no, no-a recipe for loaf bread usually makes about 1 dozen rolls/loaf. For mini loaves I use the Pampered Chef mini loaves stone. I get 4 mini loaves for 1 regular loaf. The tricks to this recipe: **follow directions**, use the exact ingredients, exact temperature for the water, use the yeast the recipe calls for. Don’t add all of the flour it calls for in the beginning. You can add flour, you can’t take any out ;-). Once you know how to make bread and how it should feel, THEN you can play with different ingredients (different flours, different oils. I’ve used bread flour, the cheapest all purpose, unbleached, wheat. Oils I’ve used: olive oil, coconut oil. I’ve maybe used others, these I’m sure I’ve used), or using different yeasts (google what’ll need to change. For ex: I use instant yeast when I’m in a hurry. But, I use less yeast 25-30% less, and I mix it differently-all the dry ingredients except salt (flour, sugar, yeast) add salt later, it can mess up your yeast, then I add all of the wet, making sure they are the right temp. I mix my oil in the water to warm it. Add salt after kneading a few minutes. 1 rise is a 10 minute “rest”. 2nd rise is for 30-45 min depends on the warmth of the room.

Delicious. It wasn't the prettiest bread but that was my fault. It's a keeper, I did drop the sugar down to 1/3 of a cup.

I have made this bread dozens of times over the last several years. I make it exactly as stated in the recipe and never fail to yield two delicious loaves of bread each time. Also works well with wheat flour. We love it.... many thanks to you Peg!

It was delicious! So fluffy, light, sweet, and soft, yet the crust was nice and crispy. I waited for 10 minutes after adding the yeast for it to activate. I also  reduced the sugar down to 1/4 cup and added a splash of water when kneading it the first time because it was a little too dry, but afterwards it came out perfect!

This is a great recipe. Yes, it is a bit dense and sometimes crumbly, but it's versatile. I made donuts once with this dough- let it rise the first time, punch, then roll it out. Cut out the donuts, let rise on a lightly floured surface until they're a little poofy, then drop them into hot oil and flip them over as they brown. It goes fast but they're delicious!

I did it for 12 servings and added the wet ingredients (WITH YEAST) in bread machine and added the dry with salt on the top in a little well ,set it for medium color on basic. My machine took 3 hours and 40 minuets. It’s the best bread I have ever made!!!!! Thank you for your AWESOME recipe!!!!!

Keep your yeast in the freezer, it will keep forever. The yeast that I use expired 18 years ago and it works as well as the day I got it. Got it at Sam's many years ago, paid as I remember $3.50 for two pounds. I never bother with proofing the yeast because I know it is good.

The first time I made this I didn't have enough sugar but it still tasted good enough for my husband to request it as a birthday treat. This time I used the full amount and it was even more delicious.  It is a bit dense as some have mentioned but I like it that way.  It's all about personal preference :)

I love this recipe turned out delicious  and looked just perfect. Advice: make sure you don’t skimp on rise time. Do allow both rises.  It works great to let the kitchen-aid bread hook do the kneading.   Then grease a bowl and scrape the dough into the bowl.  Then make sure your cloth that you lay on top is damp.  Next, put the bowl in the oven on a top rack(not on or hot) with a pan of boiling water (3 or 4 cups) on the bottom of the oven to give off steam and heat to help the dough raise quicker.  The oven is still warm enough for the second rise that I don’t have to warm the water again.  Allow to cool before storing in an airtight container or condensation may make damp spots.  I substituted all purpose flour and it still was perfect.  Also, it slices up easier when cooled but you can’t beat the taste of it fresh out of the oven.

I did not make any changes to the recipe  and it turned out wonderful...   I did adjust cooking time since I have a gas convection oven.  I used the same temperature and reduced the cooking time by 25%  so instead of 30 minutes I was more like 23 minutes.  Wonderful, with just a hint of sweet.

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half because I only had one packet of yeast, and it still came out great.  This was my first attempt at making bread from scratch and it wasn't nearly as complicated as I thought.  It took longer to rise each time than the recipe said, but it's chilly in my house too, so I put it on the stove over  the hot oven and that helped.  Thanks!

First bread maker here. Reading all of the comments made this a success on my first go round. I made mine with my KitchenAid & followed the suggestions of the BreadGuy. Important to proof the yeast for 10 minutes until bubbly. I added an egg & cut the sugar to 1/4 cup as a couple of reviews suggested.  My husband is excited to have fresh bread sandwiches this week.

Very tasty, easy to make, and be sure to cut off a slice while it is warm, and smear with butter.  This is now my  first choice for white bread.

I love this bread! The only issue I have is I wish bread recipes would also list how many packages of yeast along with the exact measurements. It took lots of searching to find out that this one takes 2 packages.

This bread is delicious.  My loaves came out so pretty.  The instructions are easy to follow and nearly foolproof.  I split the tops of my loaves and poured melted butter in the slices before baking.  All I can say is YUM!!!!!

I haven't baked bread in years so I was a little worried about messing something up. However, this bread was easy and came out amazing! There were things I could have done better, but that is no fault of the recipe

Delicious! Tastes much like Hawaiian bread. Mine did not turn out light and fluffy, not sure if it’s the recipe or just me but it was still delicious.

This turned out awesome!  I did make a few minor changes. I don’t care for sweet bread so I reduced the sugar to two tablespoons. I did have to add more flower but I think because of where I live. It baked perfect.

The thing that made the most difference for me when making this bread was to add the flour one cup at a time mixing with a wooden spoon up to 5 cups. After that I begin to knead the dough, adding flour a little at a time. For my conditions, the 6 cups of flour is too much. I end up at around 5 3/4 cups. The dough should be slightly sticky when there is enough flour, and smooth after kneading.  I also reduce the sugar, but that is just personal taste.

Delish, sweet bread. I also made it using 3 cups of white flour and 3 cups of whole wheat flour. The bread was slightly sweet with a nutty flavor. I recommend doing 1/2 whole wheat and half white if you live the light texture of white bread and the flavor and nutrition on whole wheat.

Easy enough, and it turns out really nice. I didn't let the yeast proof long enough, so I think that's why I ended up with a little sweeter bread than normal, but still really good.

I was looking for a simple recipe to try out my new loaf pans. This fit the bill. Delicious. I used all-purpose flour and light olive oil instead. Perhaps because of the all purpose flour, my loaves were a little short, so maybe better to use the smaller loaf pan size. Peculiarities: Ever the airhead, I forgot to add the salt and oil until I had mixed in 3 cups of flour so I did it then. Also, I used a handheld beater to break down the clumps of yeast that I dumped in all at once into the sugar water mix. I'd say this is a nice bulletproof recipe :). Next time, I will try slitting the loaves on top before baking to see what kind of difference it might make in the texture.

This is an easy recipe to remember for bread on the go. I substitute honey for the white sugar, in the same amount, and egg wash the top.

Very tasty with good texture and easy to make. This was my first time and it was nearly perfect except I only cooked it 35 min instead of 40 and it was a little doughy. 

***NOTE: it has two different baking times, for my loaves it was 40 min.

This bread was nice! I substituted honey for the white sugar based on personal preferences.  Additionally, it took substantially longer than 30 minutes to bake my loaves, but it could have been my oven?  It turned out well with the extra time!

It seems a little too sweet and salty. The flavors just bounce off eat other. Very crispy bread though. I used a glass pan instead and reduced the heat by 25 degrees and kept it in there for another 15 minutes. Looks good for sandwiches.

I've made this several times and my whole family loves it. I use 1/4 cup sugar plus 2 Tbsps honey. I always feel it's missing something when I forget to add the honey. The crust is nice; the bread itself very soft . It's a forgiving recipe. The dough is slightly sticky, so be careful with adding too much flour. What I do to help with kneading is only add one tablespoon of oil to the mix and keep adding little by little drops of oil to the dough ball rather than adding more flour.

I love this recipe. If you like warm and dense white bread, this is your recipe.  I've made it many times  it comes out great every time.  Only thing I do differently is add a bit more flower and water.... Only to get bigger loaves... Love those thick farmhouse Turkey sandwiches.

This is the easiest bread I’ve ever made and it turned out great. I did decrease the sugar to just under 1/4 cup. It still had a slightly sweeter taste to it, but it wasn’t too sweet.

Great recipe and easy to make.
Please note, if you complain cause the bread is to heavy and dense, use less sugar, that simple. Enjoy. I love this recipe and have passed it to my children and they enjoy making and eating it just as much.
Thank you. Ps: I even use a grade of olive oil for baking instead of the vegetable oil it calls for.
Thanks again

I'm new at making homemade bread. So when I saw this recipe I thought I might be able to do this. It turned out perfect! The recipe was easy and the bread was delicious. I say "was" because a loaf of it was gone in two days. I couldn't keep my husband out it! There's just the two of us. He asked me tonight when I was going to make more, so I guess I know what I'm doing tomorrow.

I added one egg to yeast and sugar mixture, and mixed one teaspoon of baking powder to the floor before adding that to the wet ingredients. Bread turn out huge and soft and very tasty. Also, finished with and egg wash on top, yummmmmmm!!!! 5 star loaf if I do say so myself lol!!!! ****** Also I reduced the any of sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup, made it not over sweet as the original recipe tends to be*********

The recipe was great when I hand kneaded it.  Then I got a stand mixer, the dough is so wet that half of the dough was at the bottom not forming a ball.  I’m afraid if I put less water or more flour, the bread will become too dry.  What did I do wrong?

I keep having the same problem with this recipe. No one else seems to have it but I need advice.  This dough always turns out super sticky for me. Most of my bread recipes will start to form a ball in the standing mixer but this one doesn’t.  Then I poured it onto a floured countertop to try to hand knead it into shape and it just sticks to the counter no matter how much flour is added (a whole other cup- I tried adding a bit at a time). What is going on? I have some great bread recipes but was really hoping to have a good go to sandwich/toast bread recipe.

I'm only giving this Four Stars at the moment because it turned out heavier and a little more crumbly than I expected. This could be due to my own mistake, I may have unintentionally added too much flour. I'm going to try it again soon. If it turns out better, I"ll up this review to four stars, but if it turns out the same, then I'm going to bump it down to three. Taste-wise it was wonderful and a hit with the family

Perfect as is! Just took a little longer to rise. I took the advice of putting it in a pre warmed oven. First time baking bread  and now I'm the Dad baker. Only question I received was when are you making it again?

Amazing bread recipe! If you don't need two loaves you can cut the recipe in half with success. You can also make a batch for two loaves but use half the dough for cinnamon rolls. Delicious!

I killed the yeast (water was too hot) the first time I tried this.   BUT after that, it became the end to my hunt for a good basic bread recipe.  I make this once a week because the fam wouldn't have it any other way.  No more store bread for us!

I followed one persons tip and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I added 2 tsp of salt and a couple handfuls of sesame / sunflower and poppy seeds. This made perfect large chewy soft sandwich bread loaves ! I make bread every week, this is my new favourite go to recipe!

It was too sweet for my taste. I feel like this bread lends itself more to sweet preparations (like the French toast I'll be making with it tomorrow) over using for sandwiches and other savory applications. I'd make it again, but cut the sugar by at least half.

I was planning on making a different bread but found out I didn't have all the ingredients. I saw this one and decided to try it. Worked out very well even though I used the recipe amount of sugar and regular bleached flour. I read reviews after mixing so it was too late to cut back the sugar. However, I enjoyed it with the full amount. I'd like to try making rolls with kosher salt sprinkled on top of them the next time with just half the sugar. It definitely had the taste and texture of store bought bread. Not sure if that's good or bad for most people. I'll definitely make these again and try some variations.

This is a really good, easy bread.  Haven't had a problem with it from the get-go. It's a little sweet but that's ok.  It freezes well and comes out soft and tasty once defrosted. Yummy all around

I read other reviews about significantly cutting back the sugar and or oil.  I made several batches of this trying each.  The batch that tasted best was the one made almost exactly like the recipe - I just cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup and mine used about 1/2 cup less flour in order for he dough to be soft and pliable, not too hard which, in my trials, led to a flatter, heavier bread.  The sweetness was just right.  This bread is the best I have ever made and taste and texture is just like store-bought white bread.  The recipe is so easy.  On the second kneading just do it for about 30 seconds to get big bubbles out, no need to knead longer.  It made fantastic dinner rolls but it would, in my opinion, need more sweetness to make cinnamon rolls, but otherwise would be an excellent bread for sweet rolls.  Great EASY recipe

The bread didn’t come out as I expected. It kinda collapsed after I pulled it out the oven. The texture is too dense for my liking, and it didn’t brown evenly like the pictures others posted. Not sure what I did wrong cos I followed all the instructions and changed nothing apart from replacing the active dry yeast with Fermipan instant yeast. The bread also has this strange smell, almost like alcohol/fermentation.

This is an awesome, delicious,  everybody will love recipe. We live on a boat and have a very small oven. So I made one loaf that rose enough to hit the broiler element, that area didn't get brown. Then I made six rolls, and had enough dough to make some fry bread.  All turned out incredibly delicious.

Great beginners revipe. My first attempt at making bread was an unmitigated DISASTER!! So needless to say I was more than a little nervous about taking on another yeast bread.. This recipe however, it was easy and the video (although not very detailed) was extremely helpful and made the experience less daunting. I changed nothing, made it as is. It turned out delicious. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I used instant yeast (1 1/2 tablespoons) and followed the rest as written and it came out great. I only baked one loaf, the rest of the dough was used for pretzel buns which also turned out very good. Just give the buns a baking soda bath after the second rest and bake as you normally would.

This bread is pretty sweet, too sweet for my liking. I cut the sugar to 1/4c. and it's some of the best bread except it gets crumbly so I cut the flour down a little too and it's perfect!

This recipe is fantastic! I first made it a long time ago and it was great then too. This time I halved the amount of sugar and rolled it into  dinner rolls. These were not sense at all. Light and fluffy with melted butter. Best of all since my oven quit i can still make this in my toaster oven.

As-written, this bread is amazing, but a tiny bit too sweet for my husband's tastes. He likes it best when I reduce the sugar to about 1/2 cup. I love the flavor and texture either way. The crust is soft and thin as well, which we prefer.

This recipe is so forgiving and easy to play with. For example, we like to make a multigrain version that substitutes 2 cups of alternate flours like quinoa, oat, teff, rye, amaranth, etc. and 1-2 Tbsp gluten in place of some of the white flour.  The texture remains soft and fluffy. My toddler gobbles up this bread like nothing else.

I have made this many times. It is so so good everyone loves it and lasts 2 days max. I myself can eat a loaf in one day just munching on it. It is very sweat I myself love love the sweetness. I have used substitute sugar for a couple people in my family. Just follow the conversion chart you'll be just fine. I do want to try with less sugar to see if it makes more like sandwich bread. This recipe is more for toast in my opinion. It's really easy to make I had success my first try. Will continue to keep using this I haven't found anything else this easy or yummy.

This recipe is super easy to make. The original recipe calles for too much surgar and the loaf came out to be too sweet for a sanwich bread. So we cut down sugar which makes it a bit dried. Next time i will add more oil to make it more moist.

I found this bread too sweet and dense.  I've never had Amish bread so I can't say if that's how it's supposed to be or not.  One thing I struggled with was the moisture content.  I would like to see weights for the flour rather than cups.  I think it would make it much easier.

Mine is cooking as we speak.  But, looks n'smells good.  Have made bread 45 yrs.  off n' on.  Will be fun to compare, as my hubby comes from Amish country.    Having lived in Germany, we love the sweeter breads  :0)
Bon Appetite y'all, via NC  !!
The recipe directions should say to remove loaves from pans gently ASAP  when  taken from the oven ~  for the new bread bakers.

I am a catastrophic cook.  My 7 year old nephew was in shock that I made this bread and that it not only turned out, but turned out really good and no one was injured or evacuated.  The yeast did not do that thingie, I just ignored that fact, I didn't realize it said BREAD flour (probably wouldn't have bought it anyway), and totally forgot that people kneed bread and stuff.  I did not deserve the  shining carb unicorn that came out of the oven!!!!! I strutted that shiz all over FB and just casually walked into family dinner with it just like Miss Thang. Imma going to have to make this 50 thousand more times, because for about $2 I can hit the contribution to whatever party or dinner, and that, my friends is an extra $20 for take-out!!

Absolutely delicious! Definitely making this again. The only change I made was 5 cups of flour instead of 6 because the texture was perfect at 5.

I made this recipe twice in 3 days.  This is the recipe I have been looking for!  Simple and pretty fool-proof. I did take the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup.

Finally!!!! Oh my goodness, thank you so much for this recipe. I love how easy this recipe was to follow and the bread comes out absolutely amazing!!!! I made rolls and my son ate two of them immediately out of the oven because the smell was so delicious in our house. They were completely gone the next day, but that's okay because I can't wait to make more. I did use the recommended directions from one other review for using my kitchen aid mixer. I also ran out of oil so I hade to use what was on hand which was butter. I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes as far as texture or taste, but what I do know is it was amazeballs!!!!!!

Made the recipe as is and it turned out great. I have made it a total of three times so far and use the bread for sandwiches for my kids for the week. It's a simple recipe that any busy mom can do.

I'm a novice when it comes to bread. I just made this and it came out so very delicious.  I did twerk it a little bit however.
I substituted 6 tablespoons of honey instead of sugar, used 1/4th cup less water and baked at 325 for 20 min. I seriously just ate one loaf by myself.
I didn't give it a chance to cool down when I started cutting into it. but as it cooled it was very light and fluffy.

My twelve year old son loves this bread. He no longer wants me to buy bread from the store. He just wants me to make this bread from now on. I did halve the recipe, because it makes too much for just two people as it is. I also use olive oil instead of veg oil; it gives a nice hint of flavor. It is delicious, though.

Loved it! This was my first time making bread! The instructions were simple and easy to follow. It smelled amazing. My kids were begging for a slice of it before it even came out of the oven!  It hasn't even been out of the oven for 20 minutes and half of the first loaf is already gone. I have a feeling I am going to be making this one over and over again.

Simply yummy, just can't believe how darn good this bread is. I reduced the sugar by half and increased the rise times which resulted in a lighter and higher loaf. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my first time leaving a review. I love the idea of being a bread maker but quite frankly was always somewhat intimidated by the yeast process. I was so excited to share my experience with this recipe with you all. I followed the recipe exactly, it came out so perfect! My grandmother used to make a similar bread, and this recipe brings me right back to that smell of freshly baked bread and that unmistakable flavor.

Sweet, check. Dense, check. Oh but how we loved it. Making it for sandwiches? I'd definitely cut some of the sugar. Otherwise, it's wonderful for snacking or on the side of a meal.

This is my go to recipe for white bread! My family loves it! Depending on how I am feeling, I may reduce the amount of sugar.  My family members who typically have trouble making bread, find this recipe easy enough to make! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and rich in flavor! I did not have two bread pans so i simply put down aluminum foil on a cookie sheet and put the entire thing on it, shaped like a mound. The inside was rather gooey but the out side was browning.

This is an amazing bread.  Soft, sweet, and slightly dense.  It makes an amazing french toast, but isn't so sweet that it can't be used for sandwiches (though better with chicken or pork because of the sweetness).  I do like cutting down on the amount of sugar, but the recipe is wonderful as is.

This bread was fantastic! Especially spread with homemade jam...yum! I did feel maybe it was a little heavy. Next time, I want to try adding 1/2 cup less of flour.

Very good. I just had instant yeast, but followed the yeast instructions to modify the recipe. Always weigh my ingredients, made the entire batch into hamburger buns and brushed with butter when they got out. My five year old ate four right out of the oven.  Very sweet and light. Quick too!

I’ve been using this recipe for years. I’ve recently added a cup of flaxseed and I use olive oil or melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I use a kitchen aid with dough hook attachment for 6-8 minutes.  One batch lasts the week for my family of five in a plastic bag in the fridge.  Soooo good.

Delicious! I halved the recipe to make just one loaf and mixed it all in my bread machine, which worked great! When the dough cycle was done, I removed it from the pan and proceeded with the recipe...VERY easy! The bread came out so light and tender...I will def be making this one again and again~YUM!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was very good. I made it exactly to recipe. I don't think it's fair or accurate to change a recipe and then rate it, as what you're rating was not the original recipe. I coated my glass loaf pans with Baking Pam instead of oil. It worked out great. The bread released as soon as I turned them over.  The amount of yeast given is exactly 2 packs of yeast. We ate one loaf and I am freezing the other. A quick and very simple recipe  that would make a good place to start for any new bread maker.

I loved it! Came out perfectly golden brown and everyone loved it! Make sure you let it rise long enough before you bake it. Great flavor and I will definitely be making it again.

Turned out great. Decided to use honey instead of sugar, which meant I needed some more flour (honey is wet and sugar is dry, of course).

I made this in my bread machine. I halved the recipe using 1 Tbs bread machine yeast. I set it for a 2 lb loaf and medium crust. Delicious.

Love this recipe. It is somewhat sweet, but very good. I cut the recipe in half to make 1 loaf. Note: for every 2 minutes you knead in a KitchenAid counts for 10-12 minutes kneading by hand.

Best white bread I've eaten-ever. We plowed through the two loaves and my kids are asking for more.  I do recommend doing the 1/4 cup of sugar - it was perfect.

My go to bread recipe. I've made it a dozen or more times. The bread comes out soft, moist and flavoful. The only time I've ever had a problem with it has been due to poor yeast. My family can go through both loaves in a day!

This is the second time I've made this bread. My whole family loves it. I took breadguy's advice and lessened the amount of sugar to 2 tbsp. I have found both times that I don't need the full 6 cups of flour and ended up using approximately 5 cups of (bread) flour. I hope this is helpful for others.

I've tried many different recipes for making bread and this was the easiest and best tasting so far.  Made it for the first time last night and it was excellent so I'm whipping up another two loaves tonight.  My family loves it toasted or hot out of the oven with butter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it will be my go to from now on.

AMAZING!  First time bread baker here, and I followed the recipe exactly.  It was perfection, and my entire family, including picky toddler, gobbled the first loaf up in under an hour.  I am going to play around with add-ins, such as cinnamon raisin, cranberry orange, etc.. as I think this will be a very versatile base.

I've made this recipe many times, and it's always turned out delicious. It is pretty sweet, though. Cutting back on the sugar, shouldn't be a problem. To get lighter & fluffier bread, I add two Tablespoons of dry (powdered) milk per loaf in with the flour. It makes the bread rise much higher.

I'm sorry I'm one of the people that changed this recipe to suit my tastes. But I'm sure it is 100% fool proof and that's why i was able to do so. Substituted 1c water and 1c milk for the 2c water and used 1/4 cup sugar total instead of the 2/3c because I didn't want a sweet bread. The crumb was so delicate, soft and tender. Not dense at all. Bread rose beautifully. I made one loaf of bread and 9 dinner rolls (next time I'd make 12 because they were a little bigger than I'd like). Brushed everything with butter before baking. Rolls baked up in about 25 minutes and the bread was finished at 30 minutes. Crust was pretty golden brown color; nice and crunchy too (until I smeared more butter over the hot bread, then it turned soft). Everyone raved over this recipe and asked me to share! we're on day two and all the rolls and half the loaf of bread are gone. Makes delicious sandwiches. New favorite bread loaf recipe.

This recipe was very easy to bake. This was the first loaf of bread I ever baked. I wanted to bake just one loaf so used all ingredients as half and just let the dough rise a little longer before putting it in the oven for baking.  Thank you it was perfect and now It's been 3 months I have never had to buy  bread from the supermarket again.

This bread is SO DELICIOUS!! I highly recommend it! Super easy to make. I made one loaf in a metal pan and another in a glass pan. I used a utility knife and cut an inch sliver down the middle of the dough right before it went into the oven and it made it rise beautifully! I got a prettier loaf in the non stick metal pan than in the glass pan but the glass pan wasn't as brown and it also needed more time to bake.

I have made this bread several times and it always comes out perfect or almost so, I have changed the recipe slightly I only use a third of a cup of sugar, and the bread comes out very good.

Rose well! Left the yeast/water mix for about 15 minutes prior to adding the salt and oil. Cut the sugar in half.

I make this recipe every few days. Sometimes I'll do half bread flour and half all purpose flour and it's much softer. Very good recipe to make as dinner rolls, too.

I halved the recipe for ease.  It is a wonderful bread.  Simple, but very tasty, and the texture is excellent.  I've baked bread for years, this is my new white bread recipe.  Thanks to Peg for sharing.

I made it as shown in the recipe, except I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I've tried dozens of bread recipes before - but this one is the best.  Next I'm going to try it using Splenda, as I have 2 members of my family who are diabetic.

I've made this many many times. I find 5 cups of flour to be enough. However when kneading I do use about 1/2 flour and work it into the dough. My family loves this bread. It's very easy.

Very easy. It's just time consuming. You need to be around for it, but actual hands-on time is probably only 15 minutes, max. Makes a delicious soft white bread.

It turns out so light and fluffy each time I make this bread. Which is every two or three days now. I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup but otherwise everything the same.

I used 375 by mistake and forgot 2 teaspoon sugar  - tastes awesome though and I will make it again. I would not put that remaining 2 teaspoons with these results. First bread recipe that didn't fail.

The bread turned out really well. It had a really great texture. However, even after reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup it is still too sweet for me. I will try again but with even less sugar.

Great bread. I have made it twice. Once with the full amount of sugar and once with 2 - 3 tbs. Both good depending on what results you want. I used my kitchen aid and used the following suggested method from another reviewer: Proof your yeast in the mixing bowl then add the oil/salt, the add the flour approx. 1 cup at a time with the dough hook on low speed. Once all the dry ingredients are in come up to medium speed for 5 minutes. Then take the dough out, fold it over on itself to redistribute the yeast, make a ball, and place it back in the same bowl after you drizzle a tablespoon of oil (veggie or olive) and turn the dough to coat evenly. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then a kitchen towel.

I loved this recipe.  I thought it was easy and reminded me of the Hart's bread that we got hot from the bakery when I was a child.  It is a little on the sweet side, but oh so delicious.

Followed the directions exactly. I felt the bread came out, a little drier, and very crumbly, and denser than I had expected.

I made this bread for the first time tonight and it is absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was that I added 1/3 cup  +1/6 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup of sugar. It's so easy to make in the KitchenAid mixer!  I made one loaf in a glass pan and one in a metal pan and there is no comparison. The glass is way better and made the bottom and sides more crisp. I also did an egg wash on the top and the crust is so chewy and sweet. This is going to be a new family favorite !

Watch the top of the bread. I took it out 5-6 minutes early because I was afraid it would burn. The inside was cooked okay.  May try to place foil on the tops the last 5 minutes next time.

This recipe made a dense, sweet loaf (half recipe). I did make a procedural change. I added one cup of flour before I added the salt. I've been told this buffers any effect the salt may have on the yeast.
My second bout with the half recipe found me cutting the sugar back to 1/4 cup. This got a better reaction from my family.
I haven't had any failure in this recipe. I have had failure of yeast, in envelopes that were outdated, although they had been bought recently at the store. Open jars of yeast go bad fast. Freeze between uses.
Always check dates when buying anything. Some stores don't remove, or are slow about removing expired foods.

I did not make any changes to the recipe, and have made it twice now!  The first two loaves went so fast!  The second batch I made a doubled recipe (I only recommend if you have a professional quality mixer).  Perfect both times!

Changes: 
1 cup wheat & 5 cups AP (didn't have bf)
Used an 8x8 cake pan (didn't have pans called for )
It was still delicious. I ate two slices and my daughters finished off the loaf! I overheard my seven-year-old tell my four-year-old "this is what bread should taste like."

Made it for the first time today so that I could make buns. It worked perfectly got 8 large buns and 1 loaf. I like to butter before cooking and sprinkle with sea salt then bake. Went perfect with the sloppyjoes I made for dinner..

First time making a bread dough in a while and it went on smoothly. tastes nice and sweet, delicious by itself. I did cut the portions by  half because it felt too big to be consumed in such a short time. 

Scrolling down the comments, I see a lot complaining about it being dense. The trick to not making your bread too dense is to use less flour as possible. If the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, don't dump everything in at once. Save half of it and add more as needed as you work on your dough. In my case, i have a mixer with a hook attachment so i only had to use 2 cups and 2 tbsp of flour to achieve the perfect consistency, so my bread was very soft abd fluffy.

We  have made this bread for years now and have not changed a thing.  Peg knows her stuff.  We did however learn to place a light bulb, 150 watt metal work light in the oven bottom and with the door open about 3", held open by a rolled up dish rag, keeps the oven at 90 degrees F while rising the dough.  It made rising easy.  As a result we have all but stopped buying store bagged bread.

This was my first time baking homemade bread -- and kneading. It turned out perfectly!! I used 2 tablespoons of sugar and next time I might use 3ish. Overall it was very dense but soft, good with honey butter or a jelly. It will FILL YOU UP. I might make it again in smaller loaves for family night as an appetizer style bread for the table with cinnamon butter. I'll also slice the top to make it look prettier. I forgot I could do that until I'd already pulled it from the oven.

I've made this quite a lot this past year (every week or two). It is true that it makes a denser bread that is quite sweet. But that's why I love it. Sometimes I halve the sugar to make it less sweet. Overall, it has a lovely moist texture. Be sure to knead it a full 10 or more minutes if by hand. The more the better.

I've made this twice.  Both times it came out great.  Second time I decided to try using half bread flour and half whole wheat.  I may not buy bread again!

I  make this bread often, adjusting the sugar from as is sweet to less sweet and sometimes I substitute half the flour with whole wheat flour. Don't skimp on the kneading or the bread rising. Both mistakes I've made early. Your bread will be fluffier and less crumbly.

A little too sweet and dense. I was expecting something a little more airy and savoury. I had to add quite a bit of flour during the kneading process to make it less sticky. Not bad but I'll be changing the recipe next time.

Great recipe, I've even tried substituting whole grain flour into the mix with great results. Like others, I have also reduced the sugar content, still with great success.

Very good. Try adding roasted garlic, 1 cup of cheddar and a diced jalapeño to the mix. Also added shredded cheese and diced jalapeño to the top.

I thoroughly enjoyed it I turned it into individual rolls and dropped the uncooked dough into the 6oz compartment of my divided lunch container and chucked a weeks worth of meals in the fridge. The bread cooks nicely in the microwave as my soup reheats.

ThIs bread is so forgiving!  I omitted the salt and oil and added at the end, it still turned out wonderful!   Tastes delicious.  Will definitely make it again and again.   Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was so easy.  I only used a scant quarter cup of sugar because I didn't want a sweet bread.    I also had to substitute some of the bread flour with ap flour, since I didn't have enough bread flour for the recipe.  I mixed the flour and water with a spoon, then used my hands  to  knead the dough  just until combined.  Honestly this was the least fussy bread recipe ever.   I think as long as the bread is allowed to rise fully, then there really shouldn't be a problem achieving  lovely and fluffy loaves of bread.

Came out perfectly.  It is a very dense bread as someone pointed out.  The sweetness can be controlled by cutting the sugar back a tad.  It was a hit with my extended family and I made two loaves so everyone could enjoy it.

Must have done something wrong.  I halved the recipe since I only wanted one loaf.  It rose up like crazy while in the oven  (probably due to the sugar) and stuck to the bread pan.  It broke and crumbled while removing it.  Couldn't even get one intact slice.   It tasted good, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I ended up drying out the slices in the oven and grinding up in my food processor for bread crumbs.

I am an experienced bread maker but won't be making this recipe again.

My eight year old daughter and I made this bread recipe together and it turned out wonderfully.  The only advice I have is that it's a bit heavy on the flour.  We only used 5 cups once and 5 1/2 cups the second time and the second time it was too heavy and got dry fast.  Overall, a reliable recipe, with the exception of the amount of flour to use.  Thank you!

I made this recipe and the bread came out perfect. For something fun, you can cut dough into small pieces before the 2nd proofing and put them in muffin tins.
Also, it helps if you knead the dough using a dough hook on a kitchen aid on medium high for about 5-7 minutes. When proofing, put the dough into your oven that is warmed. I start the oven then cut it off when it reaches about 100 degrees. I also throw in a cup of water for extra moisture.
Don't forget to eggwash your dough before baking!

I grew up on homemade bread and I have been making bread in a bread machine for years but never seem to get a perfect loaf. This was the first bread I have made actually worth freezing. I got a new Kitchen Aid mixer for Christmas and this was my first attempt at bread and found out they are like a 2 year old, can't turn your back on them.........hehehe (not sure where my common sense went). I was headed for the fridge while mixing on medium speed and within a couple seconds the mixer, dough and my pride all crashed to the floor, vibrated right off the counter. Determined not to give up I picked it all up, put the dough back in the bowl and finished mixing. Not sure how but this was my best bread to date and will be my go to recipe.

Wow. Perfect recipe. Made in kitchenaid but kneaded the dough for about 3 minutes outside the mixer. Followed recipe perfectly except one loaf I made cinnamon swirl. I rolled the dough the length of the stoneware pan I was using and then I used about 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 1 tbl of cinnamon on top of softened butter.
Because I used stoneware pans, next time I will bake for 34 minutes and see if it works out a tiny bit better.

It is a  simple and pleasant recipe. I cut the sugar in half as the first time I made it was too sweet. Proofing the yeast i think is essential. I have made about 10 more loafs and is a real family pleaser.

I really do like this recipe.  I have made it as directed but it is a little sweet(or would have been 5 star).  For our liking, we decrease the sugar to about 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  I do add flour cup by cup and sometimes don't use all the flour.  As expected. 
Great recipe that you can adjust to your liking and still works out! I have even used all purpose flour and it still worked out.
Sometimes I increase the recipe by 1/2 to fill 2 full sized loaf pans better--makes nice tall loaves that way.  Just depends on your loaf pan size.
BUT!!! the VIDEO for this recipe is a FAIL!!  You don't make bread that way--putting all the flour in at once!! And not how you make loaves!!  Wow!!  The 2nd loaf she put in the oven was falling!  Punk bread!!  This recipe deserves a much better video!!

I did not change a thing except I used Olive oil Through out and also to grease the pans.  As Home made breads go,  this one turned out lighter and airier than most. Makes two big loaves is quick and easy Loved it.  If this don't turn out you suck.

OK.   First off, I was trying to find a place to ask questions about this recipe and could not find one so here it goes.  I am trying to find if you could use rice flour instead of regular flour.  Has anyone tried this.  I am going to give it a try,  I will let you know how it worked out.

I made this bread twice in a week. I am an experienced baker and been making breads for a very longtime but this recipe is simply amazing. 

I made the following change:  used only 1/4 cup of sugar based on another reader's recommendation. 

The first time the bread was a little crumbly inside. So the second time I made I allowed for a longer but slow rise and also baked it 5 minutes longer for a total of 35 min. 

Perfect is all aspects. This one is a keeper.

This bread was very simple and fairly quick and it had a nice golden brown look and it smelled awesome. The taste was very nice, however it did not come out like classic white bread, much too sweet and extremely dense in the middle, almost uncooked. It had a more loaf of bread such as an artisan bread, but too sweet.

I halved the recipe to make one loaf.  Came out perfectly!!! Made a special trip to grocery store mid recipe to get bread flour (King Arthur organic)- and I think it was worth it!  
Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! I'll be making again and again and sharing with my family!

This recipe makes great bread, but it's too sweet for me.  I cut the sugar from 2/3cup to 4 tbs.  It still rose the same, and it's much better for sandwiches because it's less sweet.

I got a new bosch mixer and was looking for a good bread recipe.  I came across this one and am so glad I did because it's delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made 4 large 1 1/2lb. loaves.  I decided to share it with friends and family so I wouldn't gain 50 lbs. from eating it all myself.  I'm actually making a second batch to share tomorrow.
UPDATE 3/12/17
I've made this bread so many times now I can make it in my sleep.  I usually double it and give 3 of the 4 loaves away.  Sometimes I make 2 loaves and use the remaining doubled recipe and make cinnamon rolls.  They come out fantastic.  I figured out the cost of ingredients and it is about 89 cents a loaf.  You can't buy bread this good for that price.  Everyone I've shared it with has raved and raved about it.

This is a great white bread recipe. It is very simple, especially if you have a stand mixer with a bread hook.
I recommend cutting the sugar to 1/3 cup or 1/4 cup. With 2/3 cup it was too sweet.

for a first time bread maker, following the timed instructions for length of rise and especially kneeding (and yes that 8 minutes seemed like a long time) this bread turned out beautifully.

There is a lot to like about this bread. It's high, fluffy , and has nice texture and golden crust. My only complaint is that it was just WAY too sweet for me (and even my kids). I will make it again, but cut the sugar in half.

Easy bread recipe, and about the best I've ever managed to make.  I think the simplicity really lends itself to optimal results.  I baked a loaf, brought it into work to share and everybody went friggin' bananas for it!

BEST WHITE BREAD EVER!
I followed the recipe to the letter, except for decreasing the sugar to 1/4 cup, as I was looking for a versatile white bread, and not a sweet bread. Sooooo easy and fluffy! I only baked it for 23 minutes, as I had let it rise a bit too long and it cooked quickly. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE!!!!!

Second time making it..both times excellent! But rather use than going exactly by rising time stated for 2nd rising, I just waited until it was an inch or so above pan, which took about an hour..it's  more important that it achieves this height, rather than how long it takes to get it there..So use that as a sign that they're ready to bake rather than time. Family LOVED it just as it is..but for myself I'd like it a little less sweet..so don't expect a buttermilk or potato bread flavor..more like a kids soft white bread, great for sandwiches!

Simple recipe and tastes great! I substituted about a third of the sugar in favor of raw honey, because that's how I roll.  That worked out very well. Easy recipe with great results means it's a go-to and  I'll definitely be making this quite a bit in the future. Thank you for sharing.

This bread is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! I make it all the time and we love it. It's perfect bread for sandwiches, toast anything. I did cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and the oil down to 2 T. as one reader suggested and it's still great. My kitchen aid does all the work and I reap the benefits. Hubby doesn't want me to buy store bought bread anymore..this is great!! Takes little time to prepare and the longest part is the raising period.

I used only 1/3 cup of sugar as other reviewers have done.  No other changes.   This bread just came out of the oven and I have never seen such an awesome loaf of bread in my life!  Beautifully tall and rich brown top.  Marion Cunningham - a cookbook editor and teacher of cooking- suggests that kneading breads be done by hand.  I kneaded this bread by hand and when my hand got tired I used my rolling pin.  I believe kneading this bread by hand is the reason it came out so well.

The only changes I made were using regular flour (didn't have bread flour) and reducing the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup (based on the numerous reviews suggesting the original recipe was too sweet). It was still a bit sweet so I might reduce it to 1/4 cup sugar next time I make it to see which amount of sugar I prefer (although my family thought it was perfect). The bread was light, fluffy and the top browned nicely.  Delicious!

My 16 year old daughter used this recipe to make her very first loaf of bread without a bread machine.   It turned out perfectly.
My family loved it, although it was a tad sweet for my taste.

I have made this almost every day for a few years now, but never thought to rate it. This bread is great when you have three kids that eat bread faster than you can buy it. But what makes this bread so special is that the small list of ingredients makes it very easy to change to your liking. Say you want it more soft and moist, then you can add an egg and use milk instead of water. You can also use whatever fat you want in order to make it your own. It is also very easy to change this into wheat bread. Just substitute up to half the flour with wheat flour and use slightly more liquid. The only bad thing about this recipe is that, in my opinion, it calls for way too much sugar. I use about 1/3 of what it calls for most of the time.

I make it all the time and my family LOVES it. Soemtimes I have to hide it so they don't eat it all. :) I recommend this for those who love to bake and have a sweet finish. It is a little more dense then other breads though.

Really easy recipe. Do be sure you have 'fresh' yeast. I prefer to make rolls as opposed to a loaf due to the light texture that I have found the recipe produces. They are loved by all!

This was an easy recipe and my bread turned out lovely. I did find it tasting sweet so when I make this again I'll try cutting back on the sugar.

This read is the best read I have EVER made!!! The only thing I did differently was to reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. I'm not a fan of sweet bread and it was absolutely perfect! I read where people were saying it was dense and mine was the lightest fluffiest bread I have ever made ...the closest to store bought bread that you can get in texture!! If I could give this 10 stars I would!!! A must try recipe!!

This is a great simple bread recipe, fun for the kids to help and as long as your yeast is alive it's really hard to get it wrong!! I've started to play with adding or changing a few things , I substituted honey for sugar which was fantasic! I have also added herbs which turned out amazing. such a fun recipe to make and experiment with!

Update: 12/24/16 (Happy Holidays) - My variation calls for:  1 cup almond flour (Bob's Mill), 2 cups whole wheat flour, 3 cups unbleached flour, 2 heaping tablespoons of gluten, 2-3 heaping tablespoons of flax seed.  You get a delicious, buttery-type dense bread without the butter :) and the goodness of flax.

Used 2/3 cup sugar  it wasn't too sweet.

I love this bread recipe! Its great just as it is. My family and neighbors just loves it too. You can also make wonderful cinnamon raisin bread with this dough. Just roll it out and sprinkle with cinnamon,sugar and rasins. Brush the dough lightly with a little butter first. Then just roll it up and pinch the ends put it in a loaf pan and let it rise till doubled in bulk and bake the same way you bake this bread all the time. Its a treat!

Like others have written this isn't really a sandwich bread if that's what you're looking for. This is a sweet dense bread that's perfection with spreads or simply just butter. Family loves it.






UPDATE: Last time I made this bread (a few nights ago) it was not dense at all. It was super soft, squishy and fluffy. Having good yeast and the proper environment for it to rise is key. Not only to this, but to anything yeast leavened really. I'm not really sure how mine came out so dense at first, but I've just made lots yeast leavened things so I picked up some tricks that always gives a really nice rise to anything I make. Firstly, the temp of the water is crucial. I can feel by hand I don't use a thermometer and while the water shouldn't be too hot it should be more on the hot side than the cold side. My yeast foams at the mouth this way. DO NOT add in salt with the yeast. Recipes never tell you this, it's annoying. Salt prohibits yeast growth. Do it after adding in the first or second cup of flour, or just at a point where your yeast is incorporated into the flour. I also boil water and put it in the oven with my bread while it's rising to create the perfect humid environment for the yeast to thrive. I do this on both rises. Hopefully these help you.

This is my go to bread recipe.  I don't know how many times I've made it. I made 2 batches of it just yesterday. I usually make it into rolls instead of loaves. A great addition to the recipe is to roast two garlic bulbs(more or less, depending on taste) then squeeze them into the mixing bowl when you add the flour. The roasted garlic incorporates into the dough and gives it a great garlic taste.

I made this along with homemade butter with my 5 year old granddaughter.  Such a fun and tasty learning experience!  The bread is absolutely delicious.  We took half of the dough after letting it rise, rolled it into a rectangle, spread butter on it and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top (just eyeballed it), then rolled it up and sliced into cinnamon rolls.  After they baked and cooled, we topped with a little icing.  YUM!

We liked it very much, but it was a little too sweet for us.  We will lower the sugar to 1/4 cup next time. ..And yes, there will be a next time.  :)

P.S. this is almost the exact recipe on the back of Bob's Red Mill Artisan Bread Flour. They call it "Amish Country Loaf". The only difference is Bob's Red Mill only calls for 1/4 cup of sugar, the rest in exact.
I've made it many times and it always comes out excellent! We slice it, toast it, and eat with butter and honey until it's gone (which is pretty quickly). We also cut down on the sugar.

This is a awesome Amish bread reciepe ! Reminds me of the bread a long time ago you use to keep on counter & add something every couple days? If you baked back in late 70's or 80's you know? Only thing I changed was I used virgin oil ! Great Bread turned out great ! This is a must try even if your first time using yeast ? I always had a problem with making any yeast dough with this it all worked great ( I know it's the water temp. but must of got it right on this) Thank you for posting!

First time making bread, turned out great! Made one loaf in a pan and (following the advice of another user) rolled out the other half, sprinkled with brown sugar and rolled up. My whole family said it was the best they'd ever had, both loaves were gone in an hour!

Wonderful recipe. I use my kitchen aid to make this and it's so easy. Doubled the recipe and just before putting in loaf pans I added fresh chopped garlic cloves to 2 of the loaves and leave 2 plain. Yummy. This one is requested often at our house. The picture is of the garlic loaves.

This is a good recipe, but I find it funny that "Peg" says that it doesn't take long! lol  It takes at least 2 and a half hours. Like most breads.....

Self Notes/Changes: 
- I use 1/2 c sugar instead.  
- Brush it with a wash: 
egg yoke and tbsp of water. It gives it a glossy, golden crust. 
- If baking the bread on parchment paper instead of using pans, slit the tops for aesthetics and for the cooking process.  
- Using the French method of hot water in a pan beneath the baking bread with make the crust crunchy and more European bread texture.

I made it by the recipe and it came out great! Soft and fresh bread and I made cinnamon rolls out of the other half. Yeah, I make the best cinnamon rolls in the world, but I won't give out that recipe until I'm in the stage of passing away.

This is my absolute favorite bread recipe. It makes the BEST grilled cheese sandwiches - they just melt-in-your-mouth!  I make mine in a bread machine using half-recipe with bread flour. I also make a wheat version of it by swapping a cup of bread flour with wheat and adding an extra 1/4 cup of water.

Followed recipe and proofed the years in kitchenaid mixer instead of measuring cup. Added one cup flour at a time and used dough hook to mix on low. When all added used med speed for a few minutes. Turned onto floured surface and kneaded few more times. Added to 10c banneton proofing bowl (heavily floured with flour), drizzled 1T oil over it and made sure dough was covered with oil and then covered with towel to rise.

Came out wonderful! Followed the directions exactly.  My house was really cold so I had to pre heat my oven to 170 degrees, (the lowest setting on my oven)and then I turned it off and let my bread rise in the oven. This is an awesome recipe and also the easiest bread recipe I've tried. It's going to be my go to bread.

I love this bread.  I actually make it in my bread machine and it works great.  I just change the serving size down to 12 and it fits perfectly in my bread machine.  I have noticed only recipes with  under 4 cups of flour work well in the bread machine.  Anything more and it overflows.

I find this bread perfect as written.  When I want a change I 
 make this bread with 1/3 cup of sugar, or honey.   Often add a cup of whole wheat flour.    I let my Kitchenaide do the kneading for 15 minutes.

I made this bread yesterday. I used about 1/3 cup of sugar instead of a half, and used coconut oil instead of canola oil. The crumb is tender and it slices beautifully and tastes lovely. This recipe is a keeper and I will use it when I am short on time. I think I will use it to make cinnamon rolls too!

This is my first loaf bread. I have never made any bread before nor baked anything from scratch. I was surprised how mine turned out well. I used my kitchen aid to knead the dough. This is a very easy recipe for beginners like me. Thank you for sharing this.

Fantastic! I let my 14 year old try this recipe first, and she is a novice baker, so when the bread came out delicious, I knew we would be keeping this recipe. With a family of 8, we have been baking two loaves about 3 times a week and each time it's delicious! As others mentioned, we have experimented with reducing the sugar and it was good but we all prefer it sweet. I find swapping a couple tablespoons of the sugar out with the same amount of honey keeps the same level of sweetness but gives it a unique flavor and a slightly moister texture. I've also used just a third of the dough each in the two loaf pans (to make more "normal" sized bread that actually fits in the toaster) and then rolled the other third out, spread it with butter and sprinkled it with sugar and cinnamon,  rolled it up and sliced it into 8 cinnamon rolls.  I baked those in greased muffin tins for twenty minutes, the kids loved them!

The only change I made was the sugar. I only used a 1/2 cup. This was my first attempt (EVER) at making bread. I am extremely pleased with the look and taste of the bread.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I tried a bunch before I found this one.  I made it as is, it was a little sweet for my taste.  The second time I lowered the sugar to 1/4 c.  It is now my go to recipe for bread. I accidently used all purpose flour the second time and it came out just as good.  Thank you Peg, for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Wonderful bread recipe that anyone can make! I've made it several times and my family raves about it! The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of oil ( I was out). I use this recipe for my raisin bread and cinnamon buns...I never have any left to take to work! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Tasty and easy to make. Each time I make it, it becomes easier! My little elderly neighbor loves it. He took a bite and said, " Now isn't THAT delicious!?"

This recipe really doesn't need another review, but.... I just started making bread and tried this one out today. Oh my word! It's so, so easy and just as good as everyone says. I halved the recipe and did the kneading in my Kitchenaid Mixer. I formed 3 loaves for my small loaf pans and I could hardly stand it they were so "cute"! :-) It took about 23 minutes and they were done. Only change, based on reviews and our taste, was I used less sugar. I agree this would be excellent sandwich bread. I can't stop eating it with butter though! Thanks!

First time I have ever made bread. This is almost foolproof. I say almost because I made a mistake on my first batch. I failed to read the last part of the instructions and did not let the bread rise a second time before baking  it.  Even though I made a fatal error the bread was still good. It was a little  under cooked but still tasted delicious. My second batch was perfect. I made sandwiches and also used one loaf for garlic bread this recipe is fantastic and the bread smells and tastes amazing. I look forward to adding some different spices and flavors to compliment some dishes I plan to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

First time I made this bread exact as the recipe, it comes out like a sweet bread, which is a bit much for sandwiches.  The changes I made next go around: I used butter for the oil and added a 1/4 cup of honey instead of the sugar. Perfect everyday bread for sandwiches, breakfast, dinner if need be. Thanks for the recipe.

First and most used bread recipe used in my house. [And I need  to mention that half the neighbors ask constantly when I'm making it again.]  
As written, it makes 2 loaves, so everyone knows one will be given away!
Great for 1st time bread makers, and accommodates  kneading and mixing with a Kitchenaid just fine too!  Thanks for posting!

This was my first time working with yeast. All other times failed except this recipe. I used instant yeast by fleishmanns. I followed directions, proofing the yeast means adding it to the sugar water to make sure it foams. If it doesn't produce a thick foam, the temperature isn't right or the yeast is bad. Test out the water temp on your wrist. It should be warm but not hot and not cold. Adjust the water to warmer if you add it to a cold bowl before putting yeast in. I just used a 4 cup glass measuring cup.

Glorious! Tip: Make sure there aren't any air bubbles left once you're done kneading the dough. It makes holes in the slices and causes them to fall apart :S  It tastes amazing though. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup and that was just right.

I really love this bread. It cooks up for me very well every time. I do make one little change to the recipe. I cut the sugar down to 1/3c, since I didnt like it so sweet.

I used four cups of bread flour, and substituted the remaining two cups with one cup of oatmeal, and one cup of whole wheat. Wonderful taste and texture, I think this will be my go to bread recipe from now on.

i love this recipe. super easy. taste great. slightly on the sweet side. didn't change a thing in the recipe. i used a food processor to mix the dough. i put in the liquid portion first then added the flour cup by cup as suggested. dough was ready in 5 minutes. i did not pre heat the oven to allow the dough to rise a little bit more.

I love this simple bread recipe.  Only thing I did differently was to use only as much flour as I needed to make the dough to my liking.  I used a little less than 5 cups flour.  This is my first successful attempt at making bread from scratch.  Now I make it almost every week.  Delicious!

I liked this recipe. I actually made a mistake and made it with regular bleached white flour; even with all the interesting reviews; it turned out well. It was dense and seems to make a good sandwich bread. Many people used less sugar, I would agree with this assessment. Wondering if anyone tried honey? I like to use it as an alternative if I can.

This loaf doesn't hold together as well as other white breads I've made.  It is an easy recipe with a decent flavor, but a bit too softly textured.  I tried to make grilled cheese sandwiches with it and the bread just fell apart.

This bread is really good and easy.  I've had trouble with bread in the past, the best advice I got (from an Allrecipe reviewer) is that you do not have to incorporate all of the flour in the recipe.  My dough used to be very dry and when I cut back on the flour the dough was much better.  The other thing I have found helpful is that because my stove/oven has an electronic igniter and no pilot light I have just put the bowl of dough into the oven with the light on and a heating pad placed on the bottom rack on high.  I have also used a hotel shower cap to cover my bowl.  Works great!

I really enjoy the dense moist bread this makes although in future bakes I'm going to lessen the amount of sugar as it was a bit too sweet for my likes.

Excellent recipe and very safe for substitutions.  Was out of granulated sugar, so I used confectioner's sugar and added my standard 4 tsp of wheat gluten to the proofing liquid .  Then--I was really trying to go for an Italian herb kind of thing, so I added basil, garlic powder, marjoram and rosemary before the first rise.  Rose beautifully both times, and made12 good sized rolls plus a braided loaf.  Will definitely be making this a staple base recipe!

My mother in-law said it tastes better than the bread at our local highly esteemed bread bakery. She can't wait until I make more! The only changes I made were adding only 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2/3 cup, I lightly oiled my hands to knead the dough, let it rise in the pan 2 or 3 inches over the edge rather than just one, and I buttered the ENTIRE outside crust as soon as it came out of the oven. It was absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing!

This is a great bread. I mixed it in bread machine then baked it in regular oven. Worked great. Has a wonderful flavor.  Will definitely be making it regularly.

It was super easy to make. It was a tad dry and sweet but otherwise not a ton of flavor. Next time I'll ad just a bit more salt. Overall a very good white bread.

This bread is great, I make it into dinner rolls. I use olive oil instead of vegetable.  My family is always requesting these for get togethers.

This bread was awesome!   Easy and quick.   I didn't have bread flour so I used regular white and cut the sugar in half because I was using the bread for sandwiches.  It was not heavy or dense at all like some of the reviews said.   I will make again!

I have been looking for the perfect white bread for my husbands grilled cheese sandwiches. He claims the other breads I make are too dense for his taste.  I can't say I really changed ingredients or omitted any. I did however add a bit more oil, more like a third cup, and used a bit less sugar. This recipe, by far is the lightest and fluffiest bread I've made to date. Great crump, and crust! Excellent flavor! A must do again. Thank you

Clearly, I did something wrong.  I tried this twice, neither time did my yeast get frothy and bubbly.  It sort of looked creamy, even after about 20 minutes.  Used candy thermometer to get water to 110 degrees.

I added minced garlic to the the yeast mixture once it became foamy and slowly added the flour.  When it was time to transfer it into bread pans I brushed each loaf with some ghee and sprinkled the top with garlic granules.  This bread is especially delicious when toasted.  Will make again and again'!

It turned out very well.  I had to let it rise longer than the recipe called for but other than that, it was perfect.  A little sweet but good for something different.

This bread is fantastic. But I did alter it a mite and added more flour to make the dough more elastic and less gooey. The bread turned out perfectly.
I added 1-1/2 extra cups of flour at the end of the dough cycle  if the mix seems too gooey. Mix with your
Mixer and dough hook. If the dough doesn't all pull away from the sides easily it is too wet. Add more flour. I used King Arthur 100% organic bread flour. 
Then all the timing becomes perfect.
I've made this recipe about 6 times now. Everyone raves about it. I use avocado oil, and Celtic salt, with Italian yeast.

I have made this bread several times and it always turns out well. one note- if you are finding your bread isn't rising like it should, add your flour, oil, and then salt. The salt can kill the yeast if added directly to the water/sugar/yeast mixture.

I added just a pinch of sugar instead of following the recipe as I didnt want it to be too sweet and it turned out delicious !! I found I needed to add a bit more warm water while kneading it as it was sortof dry and not coming together. Will definitely make again!!

This is the best bread I've ever made! 
And that says alot!  
The only change I made was changing veggie oil to olive oil. That's a personal preference though.

I have made this bread several times and I have loved it every single time!! It is my favorite bread recipe!! It is super easy, ad cleanup is pretty simple as well!

My one piece of advice is to let the yeast sit about 7 minutes. Make sure it is really foamy. Do not rush this step! 

:) Enjoy!

I absolutely love this recipe! This was my first time making it, and it turned out great! I used a small baking sheet (the width of the loaf pan), floured it and rolled the dough out it in. I simply had to roll the dough (to form the bread loaf) and place it in the loaf pan. It made clean up a breeze.  Typically when I make bread, I get flour everywhere. I hope that everyone enjoys this recipe as much as I do.

It tasted really yummy and was super moist and fluffy.  However I gave it 4 stars because it is sweeter than I like.  An easy loaf that could be made in to buns too.

This is a wonderful recipe! I did not want a sweet bread so I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons as suggested. The first loaf was gone as soon as it came out of the oven!

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I used melted butter in place of the vegetable oil and used a multi grain flour. It is light and a little sweet with a slight chew to the bread. It slices easy and lasted for a week without molding in a ziplock bag. Also I used a dough hook for the kneading on my stand mixer.

This bread is our new go to bread recipe! We love homemade bread and I try to make it about once a week. I cut the sugar as others. suggested to a little over 1/3 a cup and it's still plenty sweet. This recipe is super simple with a kitchen aid mixer! Thanks for this delicious bread recipe!

Yum , Yum , Yummy !   Followed directions exact since this was my first attempt at this bread . Since it was rainy , it was a perfect day for baking .   I may try to lower the sugar ratio next batch , but agree with some  of the previous comments  comparing this to Hawaiian Sweet Bread

This is the same recipe I've been making for quite a while. I usually end up making it with APF, but it does rise better and is less dense when bread flour is used. Either way, it's delicious! It has just the right amount of sweetness to be used for sandwiches, toast, french toast, etc. I've even used this bread recipe to make herb & butter dinner rolls. Fantastic! This is my go-to recipe for bread.

I decreased sugar to 1/4 cup and used egg white wash.
It came out fluffy and lovely.  First time I have made bread that has turned out!  I will make this again.

This bread is amazing and incredibly easy to make. The first time I made it, I even screwed up and added 1.5 teaspoons instead of 1.5 tablespoons of yeast but it was still so much better than anything you could buy at a store. I never used to eat bread, just not my thing, but this recipe is so phenomenal that a plain slice of it feels like a treat.

This was my first ever bread attempt and it was FANTASTIC! One thing- after punching down the dough it took about an hour and a half to rise over the rim of the bread pans. Well worth the wait, the bread is soft and perfect on the inside and lightly crusty on the outside. This just became a family staple!

I used only about 1/3 cup of sugar, and it was perfect.  I used the dough setting of my bread machine, and had to help it along after I realized nothing was getting mixed.  After a little stirring, it ran the mixing cycle, and I put it in a sprayed plastic bowl to rise.  During the second rising, I checked it after 30 and 45 minutes, and it was not  high enough.  So I forgot to set the timer the last time.  I believe it was around an hour, because it was pretty tall.  Turned out perfect!  Loved the soft texture, even on 2nd day.

This bread is delicious, and relatively easy to make. I've baked it a few times now, once halving the recipe for a single loaf - which worked just fine. It makes a great sandwich slice, its density and texture hold together even in thinner cuts.

Need to practice kneading all the flour in. I don't have a dough mixer so I get about 5.25 cups in and then use the rest for dusting the counter as I knead. Bread tastes great!  Mine didn't rise 1" above my bread pans before baking but still came out tender and yummy. Already made my second batch!

I made this with ingredients as written, however, I used my kitchen aide with dough hook. Made it simple! This is very good "sweet" bread. Easy, came out perfectly. I love the texture and sweetness but my daughter thought, like others, the bread was too sweet. I made smaller loaves and used remaining dough for cinnamon rolls. Just fabulous!

this recipe is easy to follow and using my kitchenaid mixer made it even easier.  The second rise took longer than the first every time I made it...about 50 times so far.  Bread goes stale in 2 days, so eat it soon to appreciate the great flavor.

This was my first attempt at homemade bread and I am happy with it.   I used my Kitchenaid dough hook, and it probably needed more kneading the second time.  It was also a very cold day, and it took putting the pans on top of a preheated oven to rise.  In the end, very tasty, and I will use this recipe again.

The only change i made from the original recipe was use 5 cups of King Arthur's white flour, and 1 cup of King Arthur's Whole Wheat flour. 

Excellent!!!

This bread turned out just like the picture! ...It made 2 large loaves, although I could have done three...but the bread itself is very sweet. It is not the  recipe that you would use to dip in herbed oils or such. But for eating  with jelly or butter...YUM...It was easy to work, but I had to add extra water to get it to pull together...that may have been the flour I was using. But this is a keeper.

I found this to be a great recipe I just basted with and egg before cooking and buttered the top as soon as it came out of the oven to soften the crust.

Fantastic and easy to make.  I've tried making a few other breads but they never turned out too well.  Glad to know it was the recipes and not me.  Everyone that ate it loved it.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 2 tablespoons as I'm not a fan of sweeter breads.  I will be making this bread a lot.

This bread is wonderful.  I did do as many suggested and reduced the sugar to 1/4 c.  It was nice and light and had a great crust. I also used my standing mixer with the paddle attachment (not the hook), which helps with the consistency of the bread dough. I would agree this is foolproof if you just follow the simple instructions.

This white bread recipe is AWESOME!  I like it because it makes terrific bread without oil or butter or milk or eggs!

Who (among those who didn't know..) would have thought that possible?!  I highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this bread dozens of times and it has been amazing each time.  I've followed the recipe exactly, being careful to make sure the dough isn't too wet or too dry.  Great flavor, great all purpose bread - makes great sandwiches, great toasted, wonderful french toast, etc!

This is the first time I have ever made homemade bread, and it turned out great. Easy to prep too. I used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 because I didn't think I would be a fan if it had a sweeter taste to it.

This bread is so easy, and so delicious!  As other reviews suggest - I cut the sugar to 1/4c, but I also add another 1/2 tsp of salt.

I bake this bread at least once a week, and no matter how bad a cook I am, I just can't mess up the recipe. I've used less flour by a half cup, and it turned out perfect. Ive used less yeast and it turned out great. I've even over cooked it by 10 minutes and it was just fine.

I mix the ingredient using my kitchenaid too. It makes it so easy, and leaves little to nothing to clean up.

I have a friend from Kenya that says this bread reminds her of a bread they used to make in Kenya called "you've been away from home a long time bread". She said the only difference is their loaves are much larger.

I love this recipe. It has become my go to for bread. The recipe is extremely forgiving and versatile. My favorite is to make it with 50% white bread flour and 50% whole wheat flour. I have even made 100% whole wheat and it still comes out light and fluffy! Because I think wheat flour can have a bitter taste, I tend to use the whole amount of sugar when using it. If you are a first time bread maker, I would highly recommend this recipe and follow it exactly a couple of times before getting adventurous. Kneading can be intimidating for first timers and this recipe isn't very specific about that, so here are my thoughts ... For the first knead, don't be afraid of over-kneading as that is virtually impossible. What you want to get to is a dough that is kind of elastic in feel. A good test is to pinch a bit of dough between each thumb and forefinger and pull in opposite directions (as if you're opening a bag of chips). If the dough doesn't tear and sort of springs back to where it started, you're good to go. For the second knead, you don't need to get so aggressive with it (and this is where you may run into trouble if you knead too much - you may kill the yeast and the dough won't rise again very well). All you want to do the second time is punch down the dough to release some air and knead just enough to get it back into a dough that resembles what it looked like before you let it rise. This second knead only needs to be done for a minute or two. Hope someone can find this of s

Easy to make and came out wonderful, and believe me, I've had a lot of bread failures in the past.  I used 1/4 c sugar and all purpose flour.  Tip for rising bread:  Heat up some water in the microwave to boiling.  Take out the water and put in your covered bread dough.  The warm damp interior of the microwave is great for rising dough.  (Just don't turn it on while the bread is in there).

This is a rather sweet bread. The second time I made this I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar, and that turned out well. This is a great, easy, and tasty bread recipe.

I made a big meal for new years day dinner and this bread was the star of the table. It was light, airy and delicious. The few slices left over made great toast for breakfast this morning. Thanks for sharing. This will be my go to white bread recipe from now on.

I've made this twice in the last two days - it's soft, tender white bread that's just as great toasted as it is plain.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar - I only used 1/4 cup - everything else remained the same.  Definitely a keeper.

I just started making bread and found this recipe fairly quick. The bread was very good I used 1/4 c of sugar but still came out very very sweet. The bread was almost biscuit like stiff and crumbly. Mabwysiwyg it was something that I did wrong but I will have to try again when these loaves are gone.

Love this recipe!!! We usually buy Hawaiian Bread to make our sandwiches and to eat with dinner so this recipe is perfect.  I like the sweetness and it's super easy to make. The one modification we have made is half white sugar and half light brown sugar.

I made this today, substituting 5 1/2 cups AP flour and 1/2 cup self rising. it was absolutely wonderful! I took another reviewers tip and froze half the dough for later baking in the week. I think this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Update : The recipe wasn't quite creating two full loaves so I increased the recipe by 1/2 and then followed the same steps, separating into two loaves, freezing one loaf before the second rise and baking the other loaf. It definitely made a better sized loaf! My husband absolutely loves this bread and enjoys the soft texture and perfect sweetness.  He was eating toast and butter the other day and said it was the best toast he ever had!

Turned out great! I used half the amount of sugar, because A. Sugar isn't great for you and B. Bread doesn't need to be too sweet anyways :) I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to add healthier fats. It rose very well!

Followed the advice of others and cut the sugar down 1/4 cup mainly because I swirled the bread with a mixture of cranberry sauce, pistachios and white chocolate. The flavors came out very good but the bread was a little chewier than I like, probably b/c I over worked it rolling it out.  Such an easy recipe!

I halved this recipe and it didn't turn out like it was supposed to. But I love the taste! And it made my kitchen smell wonderful! I don't think I let it rise long enough because it is denser than the picture but It still tastes wonderful. Will make again.

This recipe is ok, but it does not make white bread. This is a sour dough bread. The bread tastes good, but not what I was expecting.

12/15/15 I made this exactly as written. It makes a soft, fluffy bread, but lacks salt and is a little too sweet for a white loaf bread (I've never had Amish bread before, so maybe it's supposed to be that way).  Next time, I'll cut the sugar a bit and add an extra teaspoon of salt. Otherwise, the water to flour ratio, seemed about right. I used about 28 ounces of flour.

6/24/16 Made this again because I forgot I reviewed it already. My original review stands, too sweet, not enough salt.

I was out of sandwich bread and decided to search for a recipe with a high rating, I landed on this recipe. I cut the recipe in half as I only needed one loaf, but I followed it exactly and it turned out a beautiful loaf of bread. Wishing I had made the full two loaves so I could share one, however I can see myself making this again VERY soon!

Slightly more sweet than I like but my picky one-year-old likes it ...and it was easy to make without a mixer and came out great. I had about 10 minutes of the cooking time because I like the crust to be more browned

Very simple, quick and easy recipe.  I have made this a few times and the only change I've ever made is to use all purpose flour if I'm our of bread flour.  Bread is a little denser that way but just as delicious.

A little dense and sweet for my taste as a 
loaf bread, however it's turned into my "go to" recipe for a sticky bun base. I would give it 5 stars for that use.

I love this recipe:  quick and easy and it came out beautifully as well.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still quite sweet, but perfect for turkey sandwiches.   I'll try 1/3 cup next time.

Family and friends loved it. I've even used this recipe for rolls. . It's good bread. So dense that it made me make bread and rolls. No "air bread" if you like dense bread,  then this recipe is good for you.

Great recipe.  Made it this morning in the kitchen aid mixer.  Might decrease the sugar a bit next time.   Going to try it again as the recipe is for cinnamon buns!

The bread is light and fluffy.  The best bread I have ever made. I used 1 Tbsp instant yeast to replace the 1.5 Tbsp active dry yeast. Sugar and salt is dissolved in warm water first. Then oil is mixed in. Then,  flour and yeast are added in. I knead it in my stand mixer till sides of bowl are cleaned. I followed reviews to use half of the sugar and it turns out just like a regular white bread. Remember after baking, immediately remove from pan to prevent sogginess. Also, cool before slicing.

This is my only bread recipe. I let the mixer do all the work and as long as my yeast is fresh, it is foolproof. I love that it is made with oil, and no eggs for allergic people. It also tastes better after freezing a couple of days. I usually make 3 loaves per batch so it fits better in the toaster, and also the calorie count is about 80 cal per slice.

This is not my first attempt at bread but my first attempt with this recipe. I've learned butter/oil makes the bread produce less crumbs and firms it up enough for heavy sandwich materials. But I love to make more nutritious bread. I substituted in three cups of whole wheat flour, added a half cup of Bob's Red Mill Whole Ground Flaxseed Meal, and I left the sugar at 2/3 cup. This is the first recipe my four year old will actually eat since it is not overly yeasty in flavor. But that has to do with rising temps in addition to recipe ingredients. I will be using this recipe from now on. 

If you are using a stand mixer like I did, make sure you do all of the mixing in the mixer on low. Once everything is well combined move to a medium speed until it is no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl. If it's been more than ten minutes and it's still sticking, add flour by the handful. 

The first rise in the bowl did take over an hour until it was ready. The second rise took an hour until it was an inch above the pan. (My yeast was closing in on expiration date, which may have factored into this timetable). I cooked it on 350°F for 25 minutes, not 30 minutes as the recipe suggested.

Best and easiest white bread I've ever made. I also tried it with coconut oil and honey for a healthier twist and it was equally delicious. I'm also going to try with half the sugar for a healthier and less sweet option.

I made this and it's delicious.  I made it according the modifcations and tips provided by "breadguy" and it's great!  Very easy to make.  I had hoped it would be slightly sturdier/denser, but it's delicious nonetheless.  Great with soup,  or spread with butter (or apple butter) or whatever you have, but  not a great sandwich bread IMO.

Didn't change a thing. Used a kitchen aid and used the suggestions from a previous reviewer for that part. This bread was wonderful and we (my 2 kids & I) finished one loaf while it was still warm.

The bread was  very dense and heavy. My husband did not care for it. I'm new to making homemade bread, so it may have been my fault. I did like how simple it was to make.

Wonderful! 

I followed the recipe exactly and made two loaves. The second one I rolled out and brushed melted butter and then sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon onto it. I rolled it tightly and baked in a loaf tin! My husband is a very happy man tonight!

I've made this a few times now and my children and husband love it. It turns out so fluffy and soft. Last time I made it I quadrupled the recipe and within a week it was all gone with my family of six and giving away a loaf. My husband loved that I made some into hamburger buns and he said they were the best. This is the only homemade bread I have made that the family will make into sandwiches as well. I'm about to make it again.

Great bread recipe! I cut the sugar in half and use only 1/3 cup. I use 5  1/3 cups of flour instead of 6 and it is the perfect consistency for me. Delicious for sandwiches or just as is!

The first time I made this it came out doughy in the middle. Make sure that you are following the ingredients list and using bread flour.

Perfect for Amish bread! Will try with reduced sugar for plain white bread next time. My loaves took longer than 30 minutes to raise to over the top of the pan, an extra 15.

I only made one loaf (had planned on two) but when I got to the kitchen I realized I didn't have 6 c. of flour so I half-assedly cut the recipe in half.  Half  recipe would call for 1/3 c. sugar, but as other reviewers suggested I reduced the sugar a bit and used a scant 1/4 c. Bread was slightly sweet and had an amazing crumb.  I really enjoy a slice warmed slightly- not toasted - and it doesn't even need butter.  It's just nice, soft, and tasty.

SUPERB!  Produces stunning lofty loaves. I use olive oil & all the sugar specified -  but I'd consider cutting the sugar.  And, oops, I used half - whole wheat flour!  The dough was silky, yet resilient. With less sugar & a splash of beer I might make it into pizza dough.  I've made this several times & it is always spectacular!

I make this bread often and it has never failed. Delicious, fluffy loaves. Also makes great buns if you take the time to divide the dough, roll, and place side by side in a 9x13 pan

I made this recipe many times. It is a tasty bread. I would recommend decreasing the amount of sugar to make it less sweet and allowing the bread to rise in the a little longer to have a fluffier bread.

This is really yummy bread.  The only thing that we didn't like was the hardness of the crust (I may put aluminum foil over it next time) and it was a little bit too sweet.  I'll be dropping the amount of sugar in it next time to see if that helps.

I made this recipe twice now; both turned out really good!  I will definitely make it again. The second batch of the two was probably my favorite. I only changed one thing: I used just a tiny bit less yeast. The bread was just a little bit denser, which I prefer. Basically, I made half as much bread as the recipe called for this second time. Because I was using yeast in 1/2 tablespoon sized packets, I had to decide between using 1/2 tablespoon of yeast or 1 tablespoon of yeast for this half sized recipe (instead of true half which would equate to 3/4 tablespoon).

Love this recipe! for anyone like me, not that great of a baker, but likes to dabble....1 and 1/2 tbs of yeast is equal to 2  packages, and I use my kitchen aid mixer. I add all ingredients except for 1 cup of flour, I kneed that last cup in on the cutting board by hand.

Made per recipe instructions. Came out with two delicious loaves. Very chewy and sweet. Unfortunately, I was looking for a recipe that comes out a little more like regular sandwich bread. The hunt continues.

I made this bread with 1/4 cup sugar and substituted bread flour with all purpose flour. Instead of oil, used homemade ghee (a little more than the recipe suggested) and it came out amazing! The bread was very fluffy and moist, you can easily chow down a huge chunk at once. I will try again using olive oil or sesame oil to play with different tastes.

I have made this bread a lot over the years, I have never had a failure.  I cut sugar down to 1/4 C for bread.  You can use the same recipe for cinnamon rolls.  They are great.

I made this exactly as posted.  It turned out perfectly.  It was very light and fluffy, very soft, easy to cut, and sweet.  

Keep in mind, this is not your traditional white bread.  This tastes very much like the Hawaiin rolls you can buy at the store.  It is sweet; however, it tastes good as is.  For our family it is not a bread we would use for, let's say, ham sandwiches.  It was, rather, a sweet treat.  Certainly you can use it for savory sandwiches, depending on what you like.  It is the kind of bread you can just eat as is, nothing added.  It is a wonderful recipe.

TIP:  I'm sure many of you already know this, but for those who don't, a great place to let your dough rise is in the microwave.  (Obviously, the microwave is not in use at this time).  It keeps the dough safe from drafts, and speeds up the rising time.

This bread was delicious, I added a touch more salt to counter balance the sugar. It was great toasted, used for grilled cheese, croutons and bread crumbs. Very versatile I'm making more right now. I'll keep this recipe and pass it on.

Best white bread recipe yet.  I think you could make 3 loaves out of this if you wanted.  But very good.  Even better, split the middle just before it goes in the oven to cook and poor some honey do the center for a sweet treat.

This is the #1 bread recipe in our home. We make it all the time.  It is great for sandwiches. I love to eat it fried with an egg in the middle. It is not too soft or too hard . Perfect to dip in a sauce like spaghetti. We just love it.

I cannot make bread and this still turned out really well! I followed the directions exactly, no changes. It was a huge hit, both loaves gone in one meal. I'll start using this weekly :)

Easy and quick. This is my go to bread recipe! It is no fail! I adjust the sugar when I'm looking for a little less sweet. It works either way!

A flavorful but rather dry bread. We put it in a paper bag; next time a ziploc would be better and hold in more moisture.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again! :)

This  bread is super delicious! Someone in another review compared it to King's Hawaiian but I say it blows King's Hawaiian out of the water! Will make this again and again! Yes, I reduced the amount of sugar and it is still sweet and yummy!  I used instant yeast and still let it rise as the recipe says and it turned out great!

Perfect!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for reducing the sugar to 1/3 C (I was making meatball sandwiches with it, so I didn't want it overwhelmingly sweet). Really, if you're not super in love with sugar, 1/2 C would be the most you might add. Oh, and it took about half an hour to proof, for you non-bakers like me who were waiting around watching the whole time lol. Anyway, this bread was absolutely delicious!

I've been making this bread every weekend for nearly 2 months now. I started by making it exactly to recipe and have tweaked it each week . I use a kitchen aid mixer with dough hook instead of kneading by hand.  I still mostly follow this recipe but I use 1/4c organic sugar with a few tablespoons honey, 2 packets yeast, 1/2 c milled flax seed, 1.5c whole wheat flour, and then add bread flour until the dough balls and isn't sticky. It's amazing and never goes to waste! I freeze one loaf and the two loaves last our family of four a week, between sandwiches and toast.

One of the easiest and best tasting breads I've tried. I've been looking for a no egg, no milk bread and this one's a keeper. The first time I've made this, I followed the instructions to a T. It was great, easy to slice, firm, and soft. It's nice and soft but a little crumbly when toasted. The second time I baked this, I ran out of bread flour so I used half/half cake and bread flour.  This time it's came out softer, but still great especially with butter. I couldn't stop myself from having a bite straight from the oven.

First, thanks breadguy for the kitchenaid directions...perfect. 
I made this exactly as written but as others suggested I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. This bread is excellent, soft and very tasty. I think I will try making 3 loaves next time because the loaves were very large. 
If you are just beginning to make bread this is an excellent recipe to get the feel for it. 
I highly recommend trying.

This is an easy recipe to follow. I use 1/4 c. sugar otherwise hubby thinks it's too sweet. If you like Hawaiian rolls then you may want to put all the sugar called for.  If you plan on making sandwiches cut the sugar.

Great bread, my husband loves it. I substitute honey for sugar and coconut oil for  vegetable oil.  I also add about  1/2 cup of flax to make the bread a little healthier.  Sometimes I make 1 loaf of white and 1 loaf of raisin cinnamon or rolls.

I've made this twice now. When I read that it called for 1 1/2 tablespoons of yeast I thought it was a misprint. I make challah bread and it calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons. So that's what I used. Next time I make it I will use the tablespoon and see how it turns out. Regardless, my family loved it. For sandwiches it was on the sweet side so I will also be adjusting the sugar.

I made is last night and the texture and density is perfect, but it's a little too sweet for my taste. This would be perfect as a dessert bread with Nutella and peanut butter etc... I wouldn't like this as a sandwich bread. However, it's still  a delicious easy to make with a handful of ingredients.  I will enjoy this with my PBJ :) thank you for your recipe.

I loved this bread I am writing a review! I had never made bread before of any kind. It always looked too hard. The most I ever did was cupcakes and cookies...... but then I decided to go a little wild in life and this is the recipe I chose. I can't believe of all the recipes I could have chosen, I got the best tasting bread I have ever had. I don't even like bread! My husband does. I only like brioche. But this was so incredible I love it! And I got it perfect my first try. That gave me the confidence to bake it for other people. Every person so far (31 people got a loaf) begged for the recipe. Please follow the directions exactly and you will get heavenly bread. Truly amazing! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!!

love this bread.. living at an elevation of almost 3000 feet,  I added a little less flour (around 5.5 cups) ,  substituted 1.5 cups of flour for whole wheat flour,  changed the oil to coconut oil,  and the sugar to honey.. turned out fantastic! kept placing a wet warm towel over rising dough and would microwave the towel got a minute when it hot cold every 20 minutes to get the awesome rise in the dough.

Just wanted say that we made this bread twice and loved it. Per other's suggestions, we cut the sugar down from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup and it suits our taste just great. I have not tried the original recipe so cannot comment on its sweetness.

For beginner breadmakers like me, I would like to stress how important it is to knead the dough well before the first rise. I kneaded it for at least 10min to develop the gluten. I'm sure the longer the better. Try the poke test and the windowpane test to know when it's ready. The first time we made the bread it was very crumbly and difficult to use as sandwich bread without toasting or grilling it first.

Good consistency, but too much sugar for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar by at least 2/3 of the described amount. In addition you can also use ordinary yeast too and if you follow the recipe it will be 17grams of yeast instead of 1 1/2 tablespoon.

If you want a upper crust, put a bowl of water into the owen and also reduce the temperature with 20 C if you are using a convection oven.

On top of it, it was easy to make!

I did put the loafs in one loaf pan and the other in a round high cake pan. The later turned out really great!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Not too sweet at all, but I like sweeter bread. The only thing I would do different next time is to flour the glass pan a bit, I had some trouble getting the loaf to come out.

This is hands down the best and easiest bread recipe EVER! I've tried all kinds of bread recipes and I was very skeptical with how easy and basic this is but it's amazing! I made 1 batch and both loaves were gone in 1 day! I made another batch and that lasted almost a day and a half, my kids will just sit and eat slice after slice. It is wonderfully sweet and doesn't crumble or fall apart like some white breads do when you try to spread butter or peanut butter on it. I will never need another bread recipe! I made it as is and the only change I made was that I only had to cook it for 20 minutes before it was done, but other than follow this recipe exactly and you'll fall in love!

Always turns out great, one time I let the yeast proof for too long (over night) so the bread was very yeasty and not sweet at all. Best not to over-proof.

What a great bread recipe!  I did as someone else suggested and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup only.  I also added some vital wheat gluten (3 tsp).  I will be making this as my standard sandwich bread for sure! Of note, this bread also seems to stay fresh quite a bit longer than other breads I've made, which is a big plus since there are only two of us. My husband loves it, and he is a major bread eater!

This bread is amazing ! Easy, delicious, and stays fresh. We make it every Sunday for the week. No preservatives, no chemicals. It stays well until Friday. We use a bread machine, makes it even easier. So simple. My husband makes it.

The bread turned out sooooo good. Crusty outside, soft inside, the right amount of sweetness. And I have two to look forward to thanks to the recipe being big enough. Making again!

This is my favorite to go to bread recrecipe ever! My family loves it!It is a bit dense, sweet, and goes well with everything. I've also formed the dough into rolls, to include clover, and a bread ring. It's made even easier with my kitchen aid mixer. If it seems a bit sweet to some, then just add half the sugar. We like it just the way it is. Good food, good eats!

I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and doubled the salt. I let the dough rise for about two hours, as it needs to rise until it achieves a marshmallow-like texture (when you poke it, you can make air bubbles). I didn't punch it down when I took it out of the bowl - instead I just shaped the loaves.

To shape the loaves, cut the dough in exactly half. For each half, pat it down to form an oval. Fold the top third of the oval down towards you (like the top of a business letter) and then gently but firmly press the whole folded bit down with the floured palm of your hand to seal. Turn your dough around so you can do the exact same to the opposite side. When you're done, just fold the dough in half along the "seam" you created (like shutting a book). Press the folded dough together. You should end up with a nicely shaped log loaf. 

Drop it in the oiled pan and press it down firmly with your palm. It should spread to fill the whole loaf pan and look even on top. Then cover it with oiled plastic wrap and let it rise for 30 mins, but NOT OVER 1" over the bread pan or it will deflate as soon as it hits the oven. If it over-rises, take it out and reshape again, then let it rise 30 mins again in the loaf pan.

Make sure you press firmly when shaping so you don't leave air bubbles in the folds, as this will make holes in your bread while baking! Your oven MUST be preheated to 350 before the bread goes in. You can test if the bread's done by thumping the bottom to see if it sounds hollow.

This was my first attempt at homemade bread, and it came out very good following the recipe as written!  It was a bit on the sweet side, so I will try to decrease the sugar next time per some of the other reviews.

Awesome recipe!!! I didn't have bread flour on hand, so I added four heaping teaspoons of wheat gluten to three cups of AP flour.  I then added the remaining ingredients, which formed a sponge. I allowed the sponge to sit for about an hour.  Afterwards I added the remaining flour, which formed a nice, soft dough and continued with the recipe as written.  The bread was absolutely perfect with just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks for sharing.

When I saw how much sugar this recipe called for I thought of rolls immediately. I used all purpose flour because its all I had and only mixed in enough that the dough pulled away from the sides of the bowl while still remaining very soft (about 5 cups). I kneaded my dough for about 10 mins and after rising and forming my rolls I baked at 350 for 20 mins. They turned out perfect! Will make again!

I've made this recipe several times and it comes out perfect every time (considering I use good yeast). The only modification I've made is swapping out half of the white flour with wheat flour. It's nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside-not too dense. Best bread I've ever made!

So, so soft!
I used only 4 tablespoons of sugar and it's not sweet at all. 
I used Saf-instant yeast. 
Preheated oven to 200 deg then turned off then placed dough in to rise. Took 25 mins. 
I baked it at 375 by mistake but it came out okay. Bake time was 20 mins. 
First time making any type of bread and it came out. 
 Definitely going make this often.

I've been using this recipe for over a year now.  Everyone I've ever served it to loves it!  I make several variations of it, i add 2 cups of cheese to it to make a cheesy white bread, i've also made a cinnamon sugar mix with brown sugar and cinnamon to make cinnamon buns(delicious)!  If i'm making the standard white bread version or cheese bread, i only use 1/3 of a cup of sugar, otherwise i think it's a little on the sweet side.  Overall this recipe is fantastic!

This made two beautiful loaves.  Very dense, though.   Makes great toast but not light enough for a sandwich.

I've made this recipe and some personal variations of it multiple times, and it's always turned out great. It's dense but soft, good for breakfast or snack because of the extra sweetness, but not quite as well suited for sandwiches or dinner breads. It does take quite a bit of kneading to get it super soft, but for me it's worth it. Now I make it with honey instead of white sugar -- I replace the sugar with 1/2 cup of honey and reduce the water by 1/8th of a cup, but it works great either way.

Great recipe! Very yummy, got it right the first time. To get the flour right, I pour a bunch in a big bowl and whisk it for a bit. It is quicker and less messy than sifting it, and just as effective in my experience. I am making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a mother-daughter tea party, so I wanted pink bread. I added red food coloring and a half teaspoon of raspberry extract, just for fun. Turned out awesome! I added the photo if you wanted to see it.

Just tried the first slice, had to have a second one too!  It is still slightly warm ( I know I should wait until it has cooled but just couldn't stand the temptation) This is by far the prettiest, soft and fluffiest, tallest, bread I have ever made.  The aroma in our home is so wonderful too! Mine rose more than double in less than an hour and the second rise was a good 2 1/2 inches above the top of the loaf pan when I checked on it in 30 minutes.   I was afraid it would fall in baking due to 'oven spring' but happily the loaves held their beautiful risen shape and turned a lovely golden color while baking ..... Very pleased with the outcome of this recipe. Made it strictly as written and used the breadguy's Kitchenaid directions for mixing and kneading.  I will be using this wonderful recipe often. Thanks for sharing. I shared a photo of the bread before baking and how high it rose in the 30 min. time.

I didn't have any milk but wanted to bake bread, and found this recipe. I made 2 adaptations since I've never tried bread flour used all-purpose. Used 5 cups instead of 6 cups of flour.
Delicious, light and fluffy. I like the result better than my regular recipe!

We love this as a loaf of bread and as dinner rolls. If you make rolls, brush the tops with melted butter right after they come out of the oven to keep the tops soft. The loaves/rolls also freeze very well.

Wonderful Recipe, I cur back on the sugar to half the amount after my first batch. Delicious bread- fool proof. Rolls and loaf came out very tasty. Now I'm gonna try cinnamon rolls with it.

This bread turned out beautifully.  Nice and fluffy and very easy to make.  I found it way to sweet for us.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup as per a suggestion under the reviews and still found it too sugary.  Not to our tastes but a very easy and attractive bread if you like sweet bread!  Oh, I also reduced to 3 Tablespoons sugar the third round, which I would suggest to anyone if they'd like to give it a whirl, turned out lovely.

Made it twice now, it always turned out perfect...even better, fluffier, the 2nd time when I kneaded the dough by hand. I also reduced the sugar quantity to a third. Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Only thing I changed was I used a little under 6 cups of all purpose flour. This was my first time making a loaf of bread and I was not disappointed.

I just made this bread today. I had to wait to eat it as I was going out. It was so worth the wait! My husband and daughter both loved the taste and texture. My husband said " make sure to save the recipe". The only thing I did differently was to use rapid rise yeast. Try it you will love it!

Omgoodness! This bread is just wonferul! I was a little worried at first because it didn't seem to be rising as well as the bread I made yesterday but since I'm extremely new at this i figured to bake and see what happens. It came out beautifully! I followed recipe but used a stand mixer . half the dough was to make dinner rolls and the other half for a loaf of bread. I don't think its too sweet at all, I love it and so does my children! Thank you for sharing!

This bread was great! I would suggest using less sugar because it was sweeter than I thought it would be. The bread was soft and dense on the inside and the crust was just right. I let my bread rise for much longer than I was supposed to though- overnight! (Was super busy and forgot about it!) It still turned out amazing though!

My go-to bread recipe. Now that fall has arrived I try to make at least 2 loaves a week. Takes a bit of time commitment, but is such a big hit with the family. I should make 6 loaves a week to keep them happy!

WONDERFUL! I am TERRIBLE with yeast breads, but this was easy and actually turned out! I live at high altitude (6,300 ft) and it turned out amazing... soft, delicious, easy. Now, it did take longer for it to rise, instead of 1 hour on initial rising, I left mine overnight. YUM

I just made this recipe.  I got one small loaf of bread, 7 dinner buns and 7 cinnamon rolls.  I did not find the dinner buns and bread too sweet like others mentioned.  I will be using this recipe again, it's great.  Previous to this recipe I have been having trouble and my breads haven't been turning out but this one did!

This is a great, simple sweet bread to make. So easy! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out great. It matched the stew I made (Beef Stew VI) very well. I did read some of the reviews and will try this again with a little less sugar for a different taste next time, but will definitely keep making it this way as well. Thanks!

This is a great easy bread recipe that makes two delicious homemade loaves.  I haven't made bread in a long time but this turned out way better than even a bread maker I had used in the past. The bread is dense and moist. The crust browned perfectly. I use the second highest rack setting in my oven when baking.  I did let the dough rise longer than the 30 minutes suggested in order for it to rise above the loaf pan.  It took about an hour and 15 minutes.  Well worth it.

The only thing I changed was the sugar,  I put a little less (about 1/3) :) I also put the dough straight into a non-stick loaf tin after kneading it in a bowl slightly oiled with olive oil. Love the outcome. My first loaf ever!! Thanks a lot ;)

I am not a baker -- my friends beg me not to bake! -- but wanted to try my hand at bread, so used this recipe. Oh, my...I think I've become a baker!! It was SCRUMPTIOUS. Everyone that's eaten it, including me, has loved it. Thank you, Peg. The only thing I changed was using 1 cup of ten-grain flour in the recipe. Very, very happy.

I love this recipe. It is the first bread recipe that I used when I was starting to make bread earlier this summer. I have also used it for pretzels, dipping them in a baking soda and water mixture. Sometimes I do half white flour and half whole wheat as well. Works great every time! I really like this recipe because the bread is dense and holds together well. Great for sandwhiches! I tend to use a little bit less yeast the the recipe calls for, between 3/4 tbsp to 1 tbsp and it works great still.

Good basic white bread  recipe. . For those who have  problems with yeast.....YOUR temperature  is approximately 97 so you want the water or liquid in the yeast to be only a Bit  warmer . If you think it is just barely warm- it is good. If you think it is the same as your temp ( ie no difference ),  it is ok, just takes a little longer for the yeast to get moving .  My oven will keep at 100 degrees which is still air and warm . The yeast need food ( sugar and flour) moisture,  and moderate temps to perform- just like us.

This is a very soft, very good bread. I have made it countless times. It is a sweet bread, so a lot of time I halve the sugar called for in the recipe. Delicious!

I loved this recipe I made rolls out of it to. I let the yeast rise on my counter before I punched it down. Once it was in the bread loaf pan and the rolls were in the pan i put it in the oven to rise withought any hear . It rose so much faster. Than when it was almost done rising i preheated my oven and let them bake for 40 minutes in the oven. my oven took about 10 minutes to preheat. When I was kneading it I added honey as I went until the honey was just oozing  out of it when you squeezed it in any direction. Then I added flower and kneaded until it felt like kneaded bread dough. Before I baked i finely diced a 1 centimeter thick slice of butter and put it on my rolls and bread.

This is an excellent, foolproof recipe for traditional white bread.  I followed some reviewers suggestions, and I only use 2 tbs of sugar.  I've been making my family's bread for the past 3 months and this is the recipe I use.  I no longer buy bread from the grocery store, my family loves this recipe too much!  I love that there are only a few ingredients, and no HFCS.  I can feed this to my family and feel good about doing so.  I use my Kitchen Aid mixer to make the dough and knead it, couldn't be easier!  I even do the first rise in the KA.  I just spray the inside of the bowl, turn the dough once so it's coated with cooking spray, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and allow to rise.  Perfect, perfect bread recipe!

Turned out wonderful, but a bit too sweet for me.  I will try it with less sugar next time.  I used whole wheat bread flour.  Lightly and fluffy with a nice thin kid friendly crust.  Thank you.

We have been using this for a while now! So simple, only a few ingredients and you can't go wrong. Make sure to let the yeast get real bubbly. It makes a big difference. The wait it worth it. :)

Worked very well. Wasn't dense at all. This might be because I left it to rise for two hours and for 45 minutes in the tin. I also used 5 cups of flour instead of 6. Very light and fluffy.

This recipe is perfect every single time. My boyfriend loves this stuff so much, he mentions it to almost everyone he comes in contact with. I'm serious.
The only change I ever make is to sometimes use olive oil in place of vegetable (or canola ) oil and sometimes half olive and half vegetable. 
As someone said, a very forgiving recipe. Delicious with good butter and excellent to sop up dinner sauces.
It's best eaten within a few days and definitely by a week. We usually give away the second loaf unless boyfriend is unusually greedy that week.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! Great tasting bread and so so easy! HOWEVER, if freezing 1/2 the dough do so before you let it rise. Then when you want to use it put it in the fridge to thaw the night before and then let it rise. Just a tip I learned the hard way :)

This was my first time ever making any type of bread.  I have been looking for an easy recipe to use without a bread maker.  All I can say is WOW!  I absolutely love it!  The hubby and I barely touched our meal because we just kept eating bread.  I will be making this again!

My husband is from Trinidad and grew up on homemade bread.  I've tried SO many recipes some with success, others not so much!  BUT this recipe is AWESOME!!   SOOO easy and it's fluffiest, yummy bread ever!   I did read other reviews and decided to reduce the sugar as well… other than that I followed the recipe to  T.   GREAT RECIPE!

Great recipe, although my dough was really gooey and sticky and hard to knead. Not sure what I did wrong? The end result was good, though.

Wow! Best bread I have ever had and not too difficult to make. I ran out of bread flower at 2.5 cups and just used whole wheat flower and it still tastes spectacular (a bit more dense but I like it that way). Great Recipe!

As per other recommendations, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also used all-purp. flour and it came out beautiful and delicious.  Melted butter and a sprinkling of salt on the top of the finished product was an added bonus.  2 words: fool proof.  Printing this one out.  :)

Yum! 
Side note: took about 2 hours for my dough to rise an inch above the pan, rather than a half hour-- it could've been the quality of the yeast I used. I just wanted to share in case someone else ran into this issue.

I was looking for a new recipe for white bread when my DIL found this one.  I've been making bread for 30+ years and this is the easiest one I've found.  Not only is it delicious but it cuts the rising time in half.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing it Peg.

I've never made bread before and wanted to give it a try. I used this recipe and followed it exactly. This is so easy for first timers. My bread came out beautifully. Smelled wonderful and tasted great.

This recipe didn't live up to the hype. I followed the recipe as is, and I didn't find it very sweet at all. It just seemed like plain Jane sandwhich bread -- not a lot of flavor.

This is a great white bread. I only used 1/3 cup sugar and am glad I did! This was sweet enough with that much and it would have been way too overpoweringly sweet with the full amount. This is my first bread, and it turned out great.

Easy recipe, dense and chewy! Yum! I will cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (or maybe 1/3 cup) next time. I did, however, turn one of the loaves into a cinnamon sugar swirl loaf, so I'm sure the sweetness will be perfect when I try that loaf!

I made this as written except I didn't bother with dissolving the yeast first as this does not need tobe done with instant yeast. Everyone raved about this bread. It is sweet and also seems more dense almost like it has eggs in it.  Giveit plenty of timeto rise. Excellent. Thank you for the recipe

I just finished making this bread and it is wonderful.  This is my first time baking a non sweet bread as well, great instructions for newbies.  I did use a little less sugar b/c I wanted a good taste for sandwiches and such.  As suggested by others I made my second loaf into a cinnamon loaf using the filling from clone of a cinnabun.  Came out soooo yummy!  This will now be my go to bread recipe (much better than breadmaker bread).

I don't understand the negative reviews for this recipe. Yes, it is sweet - the recipe says that it will be.  It is not for making sandwiches, but it makes an incredible French Toast!  If you reduce the sugar by half, it can be used for sandwiches. Excellent recipe just how it is!

Loaves turned out wonderful! Fluffy and tasteful! The ONLY thing I 'changed' was I backed off on the bread flour after adding the first 4 cups. I just played it by ear from that point, kneading in what I thought I needed. Excellent recipe! Thanks so much for posting! Can't wait to get creative with it next time around :)

Love LOVED this bread. I made half a batch (a single loaf) and it came out perfectly. Fluffy yet substantial with just the slightest sweetness. Only adjustment: I baked for 26 minutes. Will bake again and again!

Great recipe! As you can see I did some different things with it. Instead of two cups water I used 1 cp water 1cp almond milk. I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cp and only used 4 1/2 cups all purpose flour. Came out PERFECT! Dinner rolls, cinnamon bread, and regular bread. Will always make it this way from now on :)

This is the first time every making bread. It was easy & turned out great. Even though the recipe said it makes 2 loaves, I made 1 loaf & 12 rolls. My kids ate all the rolls the same night I made them & asked me to make more!! Will definitely make this bread again.

It's a little too sweet, I made two loaves and used the rest for cinnamon rolls. The rolls were great, but the loaves had a dense texture, I think maybe because it calls for oil rather than shortening? However, it is quick, easy and pretty foolproof so if you are in a hurry to make some, use this recipe. Because of the denseness, it slices well. Would be great for Thanksgiving as the texture and sweetness lends itself to being dipped in candied yam juice :)

I used 6 cups of flour, but not bread flour and only 3 tablespoons of sugar. We thought the original recipe had too much sugar in it. It didn't get done enough on the inside for me, either. It was too doughy.I will not make this bread again.

Excellent choice for successful breadmaking, but ridiculously sweet. I tried dropping the sugar to ¼ cup, but it was still too sweet. Next time I'll try 1 Tbsp. Very good with modifications :-)

Awesome!  NO other words for it.  I have been looking for a good white bread recipe to replace store bought bread.  Now I don't have to go to the grocery store just so i can make french toast!  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

Yummy, light. Followed recipe except cut sugar to 1/4 cup as I don't like my bread too sweet. Found dough much more rubbery than others I make and had to knead until my arms felt as though they were falling up. Worth it!

I have made this several times and love it. It is dense enough to slice nicely and makes excellent toast. I have topped it before baking with rosemary or sunflower seeds.

Thank you for the best bread recipe we have tried and believe me there have been so many. We had all but given up on finding a sandwich bread recipe that was soft enough for hubby to put in his cooler for lunch. It is Wonderful bread. The texture and taste are terrific. After it came out of the oven I brushed the top and sides with milk for a softer crust. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Perfect!

I have made this recipe many times and it is a hit with family and friends. As written it is a wonderful sweet bread that is amazing with butter or honey. To make a bread that's closer to a sandwich bread taste I reduce the sugar to ? cup.

I use this recipe to make all my bread.  If you want it less dense and less sweet, just let it rise more.  The yeast will eat more of the sugar and produce more gas for a lighter loaf.  I think the people complaining about it being too sweet or too dense have not proofed their yeast properly or have old yeast.  The first time I made this bread I went to the store while it raised the first time and forgot it for over three hours.  It was ginormous!  It still came out OK, but slightly dense because the yeast had trouble rising the second time.

Made this bread yesterday and it was PERFECT, I wish i could eat it but sadly i can't because I'm having problem with gluten stuff so i can't have wheat or anything that contains gluten anymore. My Hubby and my son loves the bread. Thank you for the recipe, I will make this again.

I reduced the amount of sugar. Based it upon other's remarks, and did it at only 1/4 sugar. Just right. And, this has to be the best bread I've ever made. Probably because it turned out for me! I followed the directions of a previous reviewer who told me how to do via the Kitchen Aid Mixer route (THANK YOU!).

I love this bread. I have made it several times. I do add one thing to it though, and that's herbs. A tablespoon of whatever herbs you want added before the flour makes this just that much better.

I made this once, and thought it seemed very heavy and thought I did something wrong. After reading the reviews however, I realize this is just how it comes out. This bread has a very good flavor though, and in fact, I have some more going as I type this. A side note though, if you are mixing my hand like I am, be ready for a work out. this dough is no joke to knead.

This turned out really well. I halved the recipe. I made this with baker's sugar, kosher salt, and olive oil. It smells heavenly as it cooks, and the resulting loaf was fluffy and delicious.

My first attempt at a plain white bread and it was fantastic.   This recipe is sweet, but not too much.   I could possible see reducing the sugar by about 1/2, but it is definitely just an option left up to personal tastes.   I made this using my KA stand mixer and that went well.   I added flour slowly as directed and ended up using the full amount as stated in the recipe, plus a little for dusting the counter for final hand kneading.

this bread was perfect. I followed the instructions to a T but I left the bread rise for 3 hrs before baking. Soft, light and fluffy.. this recipe is definitely a keeper. :-)

I used this for Bierocks. It was too sweet and I even reduced the amount of sugar. I will make it again as a loaf of bread but I will still decrease the sugar.

A very easy to follow recipe but mine did not seem quite done at 30 minutes, it was pretty dense also. Perhaps I kneaded it a bit too much.
I'll probably make it again and check for doneness first.

I'm a first timer too and this recipe turned out great! I did test the yeast and it was fine and then it took almost ten hours for the bread to rise. Seriously. And it still could have gone longer, but I couldn't wait. I had to go to sleep. I don't know if our house is too cold or what, but I'm glad other reviewers mentioned that it won't hurt the bread to just let it rise as long as needed. I'm looking forward to summer when, perhaps, the process won't take a whole day! Oh and also, I made rolls too, froze them, and they baked up pretty well.

This is the best bread recipe I have found that even comes close to the homemade yeast rolls my daddy used to make.  Not hard to make and does not take all day.  I sprinkle a little oatmeal on the bottom of the pan and then press some on the top.  It is awesome

Amazing!! I cut the recipe in 1/2, but followed it to a T, and it was so ridiculously amazing!! My son, who happens to the pickiest eater ever, ate 3 very thick slices fresh out of the oven. He's already asked if I'm gonna make more. Thanks for the recipe!!

The 2nd time I made this recipe, it turned out great.  I live at a high altitude, so baking is always a challenge.  The flavor of the bread with butter was amazing.  Not so much with sandwich bread.  It just lacked flavor.  I'll use this recipe when I need a sweet bread.

If I could give this recipe more stars, I certainly would!! I was intimidated to make bread, but this one is so easy to work with and actually quite fun :)As other posts stated, it did time extra time to rise. After reading the comments on this recipe, I did lower the sugar, I also only put in 1/4 cup, I will go even lower next time. This bread is AWESOME!! I also used olive oil, and I greased my bread pans with butter. I will NOT change anything else about this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Made this today.  My daughter came in from school and said it smelled delicious!  I used Bob's Red Mill unbleached white, organic everything else and brushed the top with an egg white.  The bread came out perfectly.  I amy add a bit less sugar next time.

This is the first time I tried to make this bread, it turned out great. I have however reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and next time I will increase the salt to 2 tsp as I find it a little bland.I also did not proof my yeast first but added everything to my bread four and used my faithful kitchen-aid mixer to blend it.made 2 gorgeous and tasty bread!!

My family loves this bread so much that I have been making it almost every week for the past 8 months. It's simply delicious and so easy! I use 2 tablespoons of sugar (sometimes honey) and substitute about 1/4 of the bread flour with wheat flour, just to give it a little more flavor. I follow all other directions. One problem I've been trying to overcome is that the bread comes out a little dense at the bottom of the loaf. Not sure if this is normal for home-made breads, but I've tried increasing the rise times to see if it helps, but it made no difference. The dough rises as the recipe indicates, but it always comes out with that 1/2 inch dense bottom. Any suggestions?

This recipe deserves all of the 5 star ratings it has received! I've been searching for the perfect soft sandwich bread recipe for my anti-crusty, anti-chewy, anti-all things that I love in a loaf of bread husband. This recipe fit all of his needs and even I loved it! I used my bread machine to make the dough so cut the recipe in half to make one loaf. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 only because this will primarily be used for sandwiches so less sweet is better (for eating straight the recipe as is is wonderful!). Also my bread took significantly longer to rise because the dough is SO dense, so I just waited until it was an inch above the pan as the recipe stated. Overall if you love really soft breads this recipe is a keeper!

THIS IS SO GOOD!  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, but left everything else the same.  It's amazing and dangerous- you'll want to eat the whole loaf in one sitting!  I made one loaf according to the recipe and made one with cheese.  To do the cheese loaf, I flattened out half the dough to a rough square about as wide as my loaf pan.  I sprinkled it with cheddar cheese, rolled it up, and put in the loaf pan with the seam down.  After it rose in the pan, I brushed it with an egg wash (an egg and water) and sprinkled the top with garlic powder and seasoned salt.  Delicious!

Fluffy awesomeness! I added salt and oregano on top right before baking. Great for olive oil dipping.

Oh sooo good and sooo easy! Once dough is finished rising, roll it out flat and add butter, raisins, and some brown sugar and cinnamon! Check middle for doneness though. Looooveee It!

Absolutely perfect first time out, and I even halved the recipe in case I screwed up. Bread rose perfectly, came out with a perfect soft/chewy texture. This is my new sandwich bread!

This is great bread! I have made bread before and it never came out right. I was getting discouraged. Then I found this recipe. I took another reviewers advice and only used 1/4 c of sugar which I think was enough. I also didnt use the full 6 c of flour, maybe more like 5 c. I love this with butter and strawberry jam :)

The only rating I can give at this point is a 4 stars, since it's rising now. It is easy to make the dough. I will re-rate once I've eaten it.

Can anyone advise whether you've made this recipe and frozen it prior to baking? And whether or not you let it rise prior to freezing? Many doughs can be shaped, frozen then thawed and allowed to rise and then bake.

I have made this for the last three Sundays, and find this to be very tasty and easy!  The first time I did not have bread flour, and it was good.  The second and third times I added some wheat gluten to AP flour and it was great. A tip for rising, heat a cup or two of water for two minutes on the microwave and leave the cup and water there with the bread dough to rise - it works perfectly. I also use my stand mixer with the dough hook, and this mixes up in minutes. Very quick and easy!

A very simple but satisfying recipe, I bake a lot of bread and this recipe is now my staple for white bread. If your dough is taking a long time to rise, here is a tip that will cut the time approximately by half: before you begin mixing your dough, turn your oven on the lowest setting possible, let it preheat for five minutes and turn it off. Put some water on to boil, I use a teapot. Before you put the dough in to rise for the first time, pour about an inch of boiling water in a pie plate and place on the oven rack below your bowl of dough. You will not need to cover your bowl with a damp towel if you use this method. Make sure that you turn your oven off after a few minutes of preheating and use an oven safe bowl. This method not only cut the rising time for this recipe, but I got a lighter, less-dense loaf than some people on here have described.

The taste was good. But too "heavy" for me and my family. It crumbled when I cut it so it made for messy sandwiches. Might have been good for french toast but again crumbly. It did make good toast but my family doesn't eat toast every day. So I used it for bread crumbs and that works out great.

I only make one loaf at a time so I began by cutting the amounts of ingredients in half. This recipe came out wonderful. It's a fairly standard bread recipe so no extraordinary steps need to be taken to come out with excellent results. I will definitely be making this bread again.

Everyone loves this recipe as is :)  It's a big like a big Hawaiian roll in a way, which gets no arguments in my household.  I did make one batch mildly sweet by rolling it out before the second rising, and adding in sugar and cinnamon, and rolling it back up into mini loafs.  Just enough extra sweet to make it a dessert, but not a sweetness overload :)

Love this recipe - I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup because my family doesn't like anything too sweet, and replaced dry active yeast with 1 tsp instant yeast because my batch seemed to have expired. Turned out perfect anyway! You know how successful it is when the entire loaf was wolfed down in one sitting!

So I tried this recipe because it seemed easy enough for someone who doesn't bake bread (not my forte).  I changed out the flour for all purpose, the yeast was changed to bread machine yeast and the hydro. oil was change to olive oil.  These changes were all based on pantry availability.  Turned out really great.  Would only change the fact that it was pretty sweet.  Don't really know if that was because of my substitutions or because the original recipe itself was too sweet.  Either way, great bread turnout for someone who does not make bread ever :)

Easy bread. Quick to make. I tried it in my Kitchen Aid Classic. While the KA can handle it, it doesn't do great. I'll stick to my professional KA in the future. That said if the smaller KA is what you have it can be done. 
I usually make one of the loaves with cinnamon and dates or raisins, or a hard cheese: asiago, parmesan, etc. But I've tried it with mozzarella and it was delicious. Roll out one of the loaves, sprinkle with garlic salt, oregano and cheese. Roll it up and let it rise with the plain loaf. They bake the same. I cut the loaves, then freeze half of each and use the frozen bread for toast or grilled sandwiches.

This is my second time using yeast in bread, still not sure if I'm doing it right. Bread never rose over pan before I put it oven, waited an hour. Bread tastes good but very dense.

Maybe I didn't punch this enough, but mine turned out super dense---more like thick hunks of banana bread than sandwich bread slices.  Could have used less sugar, too.

I got the most gorgeous loaf of bread imaginable (seriously, with some homemade jam, this is other-worldly!) but I took half of the dough and make cinnamon rolls instead of a 2nd loaf of bread. They rise BEAUTIFULLY! I used all purpose flour (King Arthur organic un bleached) and used my dough hook on speed 2 for the entire recipe, adding flour and letting it knead slowly and patiently until all the flour was incorporated into a beautiful dough ball. I used less sugar- 1/2 a cup, and I used turbinado (sugar in the raw) instead of white sugar. I also used less flour- 5.5 cups, and used melted butter in place of the oil. I let mine rise 1 hour the first time, then the bread reached 1inch over the top of my loaf pan in a 30 minute second rise. I heated my oven with a Pyrex bowl of water to 200 degrees, then turned it off and let the oven cool 10 minutes, and let the bread dough and cinnamon rolls (smeared with a mixture of softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, etc and rolled up, cut into rolls) rise in the warmed oven together both times.They came out remarkable. I will never have a Cinnabon craving that rolls made with this bread recipe would not absolutely 100% satisfy! Amazing sandwich bread, dense but soft. My go-to recipe now!! Cant screw it up!!

This is a pretty nice tasting bread, but far too sweet for my tastes. I also just find the texture to be more dense and crumbly - reminds me of Ukrainian easter bread, "paska" - and less stretchy yeast bread. I still make this occasionally without adding the full amount of sugar, but that's just when my brain isn't working well enough to try to remember my own recipe. It's definitely a fine bread. Still would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for an easy recipe starting out making bread. A good tip for this recipe is to be careful when adding the last of the flour and make sure you don't accidentally dry out the dough. A bit at a time worked in at the end is the safest way for to avoid this, but you can always add in a few drops of water if you find you've got something a bit stiff. This recipe also makes pretty good dinner rolls.

I've been using this recipe for a while now. I use 1/2 for a family tradition we call hoodoos (a fried dough) and the other 1/2 for a loaf of bread for the next day. The loaf makes the best French toast ever. My wife and kids love it.

Wow!!  My kids claim this is the best bread I've ever made.  Didn't change a thing...followed recipe as is, including the suggestion in a review to proof yeast in my Kitchenaid bowl.  I didn't use full 6 c bread flour as weather in Vegas sometimes calls for less flour.  Not too sweet.  Bread is fluffy and light.  Cuts beautifully.  Great with jam or butter or solo. Wonderful recipe and I think I may be making it every week!

Easy, basic recipe.  Based on other reviews, I halved the amount of sugar as I didn't want a sweet loaf. Also, I think less sugar makes for better tasting bread generally speaking.

I used the conversion to metric function and halved the amounts to make only a single loaf.  Finally, I did the rise in a basket and turned out the bread onto a hot pizza stone in the oven, and had the temperature at 200C instead of the recommended 170C.

It turned out very well, was super easy to make and the pizza stone gave it a very nice crust.

I've made this bread twice now and both times it turned out great.  I think in future I'll keep the sugar and add some dried fruit to make a raisin bread.  I think it would work a treat.

Delicious and easy to follow, yields two good sized loaves (more if you let it rise in a very warm environment. I accidentally doubled the yeast and brushed the tops with egg yolk and got the best rolls i've ever had!

This is a nice white bread. I use the recipe to make rolls for southern pulled-pork sandwhiches. With the flour that I use, I find that 6 cups is too much. I use 5 cups and then knead a half cup more into the dough. I actually make all bread like that to keep an eye on the density/dryness of the dough. Normally, I make white bread with much less sugar but this is an interesting change.

I love this recipe! As a novice bread maker I had no trouble with this one. The only things I did different was I made 3 1.4lb loafs instead of two large ones and I cut the sugar to 2tbls as suggested. I use a mixer (bad hands) and this was fast and really easy. My friend and family are very impressed with the taste and look. Thank-you!

I cut this entire recipe in half, to make one loaf, and i only used 1 T of turbinado. However, I was only interested in making white bread, not Amish white bread. Thank you for sharing. This is a fantastic,fool-proof recipe!

Awesome! Worked perfectly. Since it is chilly in the house right now, after I let it rise for the first time and put it in the loaf pan, I set the oven to "warm" (around 100 degrees F) and let it rise the rest of the way in the warm oven with the door slightly cracked. Then, once it had risen, baked per instructions. Yum yum.

I really like this bread. Used about 1/4c sugar instead of 1/3c(half recipe) as some suggested maybe using less. Rolled it up with cinnamon in it and it was super yummy. Going to try some french toast with it in the morning. But definitely a keeper!

So good & I cannot believe how easy it is to make. My kids & husband love it. I half the sugar & use all purpose flour, I do have to allow the dough double time to raise an inch above the loaf pan.

Incredible.  Pretty sweet, but that suits me fine.  Makes beautiful, bread-shaped slices.  I've made a few great sandwiches with it, but I usually use it for toast or just to eat straight.

Not only is this by far and away the best bread I've ever made, it's the best bread I've ever HAD. Holy moly.

This bread is perfect. Fluffy, soft, perfectly sweet and EASY. Very, very easy. I mixed it up by hand, not in a mixer like I usually do, and it was a breeze. I used softened butter instead of oil and half brown sugar/half organic cane sugar, but those were the only alterations I made to the recipe. This is the bread I've been hoping for the millions of times I've baked it in the past. So happy!

Thanks so very much for the wonderful recipe!

Quite possibly the best and most forgiving recipe. I would definitely recommend this for beginners to boost their confidence.

I thought for sure that my bread would be flat and hard as my yeast didn't proof the best. My dough did NOT rise in the first hour, so I kneaded it and put it in the bread pans as instructed. I set them in my cold oven and filled a large bowl with hot water and set it under the pans and closed the door. I let them rise AGAIN for another hour - it worked! So, it took an additional 30 minutes than expected but sooo worth it. The bread is moist, fluffy and so delicious! The only adjustment I made was the sugar. I only used 1/4 cup. I will be making this again for sure (with better yeast!) - thanks for sharing! :)

This simple recipe has convinced me to make our family's bread fresh every morning. The extra loaf makes a lovely gift.

Bread tastes GREAT !!!First time baking bread, and it came out perfect :)Crispy on the outside, soft and airy on the inside. I did let it rise for an hour (the 2nd time, while in loaf pans and turned on the house heat up for that particular room the dough was rising in). It is a very rich bread. OMG ! Definitely a keeper !

The thing I love about this recipe is the simplicity of it. I am living somewhere remote where supplies are hard to come by, so the less ingredients the better. But despite the lack of ingredients, the bread ended up really great - not too light or dense, not too sweet or salty, just right in every way. Perfect for toast or eating fresh (the freshness kept for about 3-4 days before getting a bit stale).

This bread was good, but it's really dense and a little sweet to be your "everyday" bread.  I ended up using it to grill paninis and make french toast.  There wasn't anything wonderfully over-the-top delicious about it.  But if you're looking for a thick, specialty loaf this is good. Solid B rating.

The bread is delicious, and the recipe is so easy to remember! However, I can never get the loaves dense enough to be sandwich worthy, like in the picture. It's always falling apart as soon as I cut it. But it's still delicious to eat alone, with butter, honey, or jam!
...I also have a very old gas range oven, which probably doesn't cook them very well. That could be why.

Love it with a few adjustments as others suggested only 2 tbsp sugar, less flour I add 1 cup at a time until it comes off the side of the bowl then mix on high 5 min and then by hand kneeling in another half cup flour for a total of 5.5 cups.  I let rise in a large Tupperware bowl with lid that sits in a sink filled with hot water the key being its Not metal you can use any bowl in our cold house the dough still doubles in 30 min.

Using fresh King Arthur bread flour, fresh Fleischman Active Dry yeast, and a Kitchen Aid mixer, I followed the recipe exactly. I have made lots of bread, and this is a great recipe. Moist, soft, white bread. Excellent.

I use this recipe as the base for many different breads and I've never been disappointed.  I roll it out, cover with cinnamon and raisins, roll it up and bake it as a cinnamon swirl bread.  I add spices to it and don't let it rise as much the second time for a dense bread.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

I like the recipe. I wonder if allowing the loaf to cool down would make it easier to cut? I put one loaf in the freezer for a minute to cool down and it cut a little better, but I didn't leave it in there long. When I cut the fresh loaf it was a little soft and sometimes it broke up a little. I'll make it again, but next time I'll use bread pans instead of making baguettes. I don't have any baking pans, so I do as best as I can with some tin-foil and the racks.

I am glad the recipe made two loaves because I cannot stop eating it!  Very easy to make and came out just right.  A good, basic white bread great warm with garlic butter smeared on top!  the only change i made was the cut the sugar by half and that was just the right amount of sweetness for us.

I have been using this recipe for a year now and would like to send a heartfelt thanks out to Peg.  Not only is it easy to make but I am also able to stretch the recipe to make cinnamon buns.  My family is always soooo happy when I make bread!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe

Amazing. Incredibly forgiving for a first time bread maker. I did cut the sugar in half per some of the comments here. It turned out amazing, even just using all purpose flour. Thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have been using it for years. It is simple - just a few ingredients. I don't use it for bread, I use it for anything that calls for sweet dough or crescent dough. If I am making cinnamon rolls or something sweet, I include all the sugar. If I am making dinner rolls or something savory, I only use half the sugar. Either way it is an easy, delicious recipe.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! The first batch I made I used a bit less flour than the recipe called for and it turned out this melt in your mouth bread that was so addicting! Let's just say it didnt last long! The next batch imade I used almost all of the flour and it still turned out great. Noy as melt in your mouth but it made some very good ssandwiches and oh so delicious French Toast. : )

So good! I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and the bread came out great...toast it with a bit of honey, yummy! 

It also makes a light soft pizza dough. When making pizza I increased sugar to 1/2 cup.

I made this the other night.   It came out looking beautiful,  BUT, it tasted too sweet. Not like bread should.   I'm not sure if cutting back on the 2/3  c sugar would prevent the yeast from rising, though.

This recipe is amazing!  I cut the sugar in half and just used 1/3 cup.  Made it just a bit sweet.  I also brushed melted butter on top.  The crust was nice and crisp while the inside was soft.  It was very easy to make.  Only a bit time consuming letting the dough rise both times.

This is such an easy bread that is so good! I never made bread before, it has always intimidated me but this seemed simple enough and gave it a shot. One great tip I found on line to help your bread rise is place the pan on a heating pad. I tried this and it worked great. Who needs to buy bread or a bread maker... this is to good to pass up! The only slight change I made was I added some wheat germ.

It was fantastic!!! My twist is that I didn't have a bread pan so I used a bundt pan (same temp and time). It came out so soft and almost tastes like wonder bread to me. I will have to get a bread pan though because I want to use this for sandwich bread.  Also, I halved the recipe. Worked just fine.

This is a great recipe...I followed the suggestion below for using a mixer...I only used 2tbsp of sugar and only added enough flour approx 5 1/2 cups to make the dough come off the bowl...I kneaded the dough down three times and let the dough rise for an hour...the last kneading I kneaded by hand with a little flour on the board and let rise the the pan for approx 45 min...everyone loved it...nice crispy crust with nice light bread inside

Absolutely love this recipe!  It's so easy and the bread comes out perfect every time.  I use my Kitchen Aid to mix the ingredients and knead the dough so it's very easy to clean up too!  The bread has just the right amount of sweetness and makes great french toast.

I made two small changes.  I substituted the 2/3 cup sugar for 2/3 cup raw honey.  I also substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil. My only complaint is that the bread turned out a bit on the sweet side, so it wasn't quite a "white" bread. It was more like a sweet bread.  I will make it once more, with half the honey, and hope its more of a white bread.  Although my whole family thinks this turned out great, I don't think it would be that great for a deli sandwich.  I also made this, by hand, no bread machine.  I think I needed to knead the dough a tad bit more, as it was a little on the spongy side, and the overall texture wasn't what I thought it would be.  This is also my first time making bread.

Delicious and easy bread to make. My husband and kids eat this up before it has even had a chance to cool down. They love it with butter or to dip into beef stew. Absolutely delicious!

my bread was soft and fluffy, you really have to let the yeast proof in the warm water and sugar for at least 10 minutes before you add the other ingredients, it was a tad bit on the sweet side so next time I will use a bit less sugar, I made half of the dough into rolls with garlic butter and herbs and cracked pepper and coarse salt this also cut the sweetness

I am a tried and true non-bread-baker - until I found this recipe. It is literally the only bread I bake now, and the only one to not turn out like rocks :). The crust is lovely (due to the sugar), and if you monitor the flour (I use a little less, usually), it's a bouncy, light, perfectly non-hockey-puck creation. Thank you for this recipe!!

Fantastic recipe! It's incredible easy to make and delicious. I scaled down the recipe to about 10 servings to make a small loaf. I also reduced the sugar substantially down to 1 tablespoon and used olive oil in the dough and non stick spray to coat. Came out incredibly delicious and very healthy too. I don't think all the sugar is necessary unless you just like your bread sweeter. Next time I will try to make it with whole wheat flour. 5 stars for this one!

This is a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe, for any baking experience level. I am definitely no expert baker. I made this recipe with my 9 year old son. He did most of the measuring, mixing, kneading and punching! (I did the dividing and baking.) Not knowing whether or not he got all the measurements precise, I took a chance. It turned out fantastic! It is a bit dense, so if light and fluffy is what you are after, this many not be the bread for you. I couldn't find my big loaf pans, so we used mini's and ended up with 4 HUGE loaves. I recommend letting the loaves sit and cool a bit before cutting. Awesome! Thank you all for the tips and hints!

Best bread recipe I've ever tried. Make two loaves, or one loaf and rolls or buns, every week. I haven't made sandwiches with store bought bread for months and don't plan to. This bread makes every sandwich I make special and delicious. On weekend morning I put some pats of butter on a slice and bake it for 10 mins., then spread some grape jelly on it and eat it with my coffee. Will be no more settling for me.

This a delicious bread and I found it easy to make.  I used this fast rise yeast and it worked fine.  I also lessened the sugar and kept my rising bowl warm.  Think I could have let it rise a little longer than the recipe and it took 40 minutes on the second rise.

Most commercial breads and flours have a chemical called Bromide in them (usually packaged as dough enhancers, labeling not required except for in CA) - which has been outlawed in the EU and Canada for it's health risks (cancers, thyroid issues, goiters), but not here.  You can buy flour without Bromide - King Arthur brands is Bromide Free and most organic flours are as well.

I love this one. It was very moist, a little dense and sweet.  Not as sweet as Hawaiian bread.  It tastes almost exactly like the bread at one of my fave restaurants in a small town in Central PA. It's like a slice of home. The one thing I did differently is substitute half the bread flour for all purpose flour.

This is the best recipe if you don't have a bread machine. I let rise twice and then covered with a damp cloth and wrap overnight before final rise, as well as used a little more flower for Denver's altitude( about 1/4 cup more). Amazing! Also boiled some butter and honey, which I brushed on twenty minutes before the bread was finished. High altitude needs about ten more minutes to bake. Love Love Love.

This bread was very easy to make. I halved the recipe to make one loaf of bread instead of 2. I also added less sugar (to try make a more traditional sandwich bread) and I used a white whole wheat flour. The bread is super dense. We cut into it hot and had some with butter. It was ok but not amazing. If I make this again I won't change anything to see how it is as written.

This is a really good, basic bread recipe.  It works great for sandwiches, toast, or just to pass at the table with meals.  I agree with other reviewers that it calls for too much sugar.  I reduced the amount to 1/4 cup.  Other than that I followed the recipe.

My family loves this bread! It tastes a lot like Hawaiian Bread. Not only is it great with just butter, it makes amazing bread pudding and stuffing! It's very important that you don't use exact times when letting the yeast proof and the dough rise. I usually take the entire morning to make this bread and let it rise for a couple hours, both in bowl and as a loaf.

I was rather disappointed with the way this bread turned out! It was far to heavy, and quite sweet. I found I needed to bake it for much longer then recommended (around 50 minutes). It DID however make fantastic french toast. That, sadly, was about all it was good for!

My first time making it, turned out great, was easy to make. I used less sugar and made half of the original serving size so just one loaf. Simple and easy to make.

The recipe was okay. I followed the recipe to a T even though I knew halfway through that there was too much flour. Next time I try this recipe I am using less flour. The ending product was a bit heavy.

Being slightly new to making homemade everything, I'd say this recipe is hard to mess up and makes a great tasting bread. It's encouraging to keep practicing.

I have made this recipe twice now in a week. We love this recipe and plan to continue to make it. My lady loves the dense texture and slight sweetness. It is great right out of the oven; warm with butter. We have substituted it for biscuits with gravy and it fills the bill. We highly recommend this recipe.

I LOVE this recipe! I have made it both exactly as the recipe states for a sweet "Hawaiian style" bread and have reduced the sugar to 2 Tbsps and used it as traditional sandwich bread. I honestly don't have a preference; they are both great!
I have recently moved from a fairly dry area of the state where I never had any problems with this recipe forming up on my KitchenAide dough hook. Now that I am in a very humid area of the Gulf Coast, I have to add an extra 1/4 C or so of flour. Still my favorite go-to bread recipe with no milk or eggs required!

love this recipe, came out exactly the way it looked in the picture, it smells and taste great too. YUM YUM. 30 minutes to raise in the pans is too short a period of time I waited until it doubles in size, which took about an hour.

Fantastic!  I am now the "House Husband" (Combat Disabled Military Officer), my wife is a college professor... and I am the "chief cook and bottle washer".  My wife bought me something with a hook for making bread (yes, it had to be pink...) but, making bread is now my big thrill.  This bread was fantastic... after using store bought mixes, this is easier, better and lots cheaper.  Our 11-year-old loves it, and now the dog follows me constantly for his piece.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it, it was *DIVINE*. Some people said it was too dense, so I let it rise for 2 hours, and it was nice and fluffy. Plus it made 3 nice loaves. The second time, I cut the sugar in half, like many people suggested. I wouldn't recommend doing this. This bread needs to be a sweet bread - when you cut out the sugar, it just doesn't taste quite right. Next time, I'll probably make it with just a little under the 2/3 cup.

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it countless times. I love the slight sweetness however my loafs, or rolls aren't dense as many other reviews have mentioned. I get a wonderfully soft, fluffy loaf every time! This bread was the first from scratch bread recipe that I attempted and it has been a success every time. Please give it a try but if you desire a less sweet bread (it isn't sweet to me) reduce the amount of sugar and enjoy!

I was so intimidated to try this, but it didn't come out too bad for my first time.  :)

I did brush the tops with melted butter and used cooking spray on the pans.  I also let the yeast proof in the Kitchen Aid mixing bowl as suggested. After I punched it down and put it aside to rise the second time, the loaves still didn't rise an inch over the top of the pans.  They crumbled and didn't look quite like in the picture.  Still...it was darn tasty though.  I'm going to try again this weekend and use the niece and nephews as my guinea pigs.

Easy recipe and can be easily altered for flavored breads, rolls, etc. I am not a beginner bread maker, and I followed everything to the letter. Went to put my loaves in the oven and they fell. I'm a little disappointed, but I'll be making this as many times as necessary to get the perfect rise.

This is the first time ever that I'm baking a bread and it turned out great. It was delicious and looked great. Couldn't have asked for a better recipe.

I love this bread.  I have friends who request this bread instead of a gift for holidays!  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup when planning to use it just for sandwiches.  The sweeter dough is great for cinnamon bread. This is definitely my "go to" bread recipe!

This was a huge success even though I messed it up! I over-kneaded it so it was on the gummy side and didn't rise well. The taste made up for it, though!

This bread is wonderful, husband will no longer eat bought bread!  Have made 3 times and it was perfect every time.  Great texture.  Did decrease salt to 1/4 teaspoon, but this is because we are on a low salt diet.  Makes fantastic sandwiches, French toast and regular toast.  Cannot go wrong with this wonderful recipe - Thanks for posting.

This is an incredibly simple bread to make. It is a dense bread and maybe next time I will try to reduce the sugar that others recommended.  It is certainly a keeper!!!

I loved this cake. Sweet so no need for jam or margarine or butter to eat it with but it was ready in half the oven time recommended (it took 15min)I used half the mix to make donuts fried at very low heat to get cooked all the way. Amazing

For my first time ever making bread I thought this was a great recipe. I took into consideration some of the comments about reducing the sugar just a bit and it turned out great. Where I am living right now in China it is very difficult to find a good plain bread so I will be making this over and over again! The rec end result recipe was simple and the end result tasted great :) Very happy to have real bread again :)

I'm new at making bread and trying out a few different recipes.  This bread was sweet and delicious.  The second rise was a little slower then 30 minutes but so worth the wait. I used melted butter instead of oil as another reviewer suggested.  Yum Yum  Thanks for great recipe I will definitely be making again.

I was looking for a simple, delicious bread and I have found it in this recipe. The only criticism that I have with the recipe as posted is that I found that I have to allow the loaves more than a half hour to rise, else the loaves look sloppy when baked--still very tasty, though. Take your time and allow the loaves as much time as they need to rise fully and you'll have an irresistible, versatile bread in no time.

I made a half batch of this recipe and it was good...It may have been too cool in my kitchen for the dough to rise properly and I was feeling too anxious to wait! After reading the other reviews I cut the amount of sugar in half and it was still pretty sweet...I'd cut it down a bit more next time. Also, it took longer than one hour to bake and it was a bit doughy as I took it out too soon. Otherwise it was good and I look forward to making a few changes and trying again!

Easy, simple and yummy. I have made is several times and love how it comes out with one loaf and two. Is a sweet bread so if you dont like sweet bread i would decrease the sugar. I did use for bread pudding and used the right amount of sugar and it worked great. Was the best  bread pudding i have ever made from what my fiance and his friend told me. Is wonderful with butter and honey.

I've always loved this recipe - making it by hand, mixing raisins and nuts into it to make it a snack bread. 

Today I made it with the bread machine (Sunbeam BM2500) for the first time. I halved the recipe and cut down the yeast to 2tsp from 2 1/4. Method is pretty simple. Water, sugar, yeast - let it foam. Add salt, oil, flour - level it and chuck the bread bin into the machine. Use Basic or White bread setting. Add raisins and nuts when the machine prompts for it.

It turns out perfect, just like if it were done by hand. Fluffy and soft!

The whole family loved this bread and it is one of the easiest recipes for yeast bread.  It has a slight sweet flavor.  I added a little more than 1/4 cup flax seed flour to the recipe to make it a little healthier and to add fiber.  Will definitely make it again!

It was very easy to make, and smelled awesome, and came out perfect!  We loved it!  It is very dense and sweet, a good bread for snacking on with butter or some other spread - I dont know that it would make a good sandwich bread, but as a snacking bread it's great.

This bread was excellent!  I of course made my own modifications (used it as a base to make garlic bread) and used less sugar than called for but I loved the taste, texture, and density and will definitely make it again!  Probably today actually:).

I have made this recipe at least once a week for nearly a year. It turns out every time, and is always a winner. We don't buy store bought bread. This is a thick, dense bread, so it creates a thick, hearty bread for sandwiches, SOS, and it makes a fantastic bread pudding. If you are expecting home made bread to be like commercial bread, then you will be disappointed. I will sometimes use less sugar than listed, or substitute the sugar for pure honey from my husbands Uncle's bees.

I forgot to add that if you add an egg wash to this bread, it takes it from really good to amazing. I mix up an egg really well and then brush it over both loaves before putting them in the oven, making sure to get every bit of exposed dough. It makes the crust nice and crispy and gives it a wonderful rich flavor.

This bread is everything that I look for in a bread.  It's good with just about anything or even by itself.  The recipe was easy to follow, though I would call the water hot, not warm.  I will definitely make this recipe again and recommend it to everyone!

Excellent recipe, easy to make.  Not an expert, but I've made a lot of bread over the years, so not a newbie, either. I used bread flour and followed the recipe exactly except for the sugar.  I reduced it to 1/3 c. as recommended by several reviewers.  Bread rose beautifully, has a lighter texture than most breads I have made.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it does not have as strong a flavor as most breads I've made.  Possibly the trade off is due to how light a texture it is? because of the reduced sugar? not sure.  Anyway, a very worthwhile recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup as suggested. Let it rise for about 40 min for the second rise and it turned out fluffy and light. It hasn't even been out of the oven for a half hour and already half a loaf is gone! Even my little ones love it.

I want to add that this recipe is perfect for cinnamon buns as well. Do everything the same just in the end instead of forming into loaves, roll it out and spread a mixture of butter, cinnamon and brown sugar. Roll and cut into slices.

This recipe was simple and easy to make.  The bread turned out a little sweet too (which I liked).  I didn't have bread flour so I added 2 tablespoons of gluten flour to the all-purpose flour which helped it rise even more.

Read many reviews before I made this.  I cut the recipe in half to make only 1 loaf.  Following others advice, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and I feel that it was still too sweet.  I also had to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour as the dough was way too sticky to work with.  I used my kitchenaid dough hook to "knead" the dough for five minutes prior to letting it rise.  The texture was fluffy and not at all dense as described by many reviewers.  I will definitely make this again, without any sugar.

I made the half recipe since I only have one loaf pan, and it came out PERFECT the first time!  Living above 7000 ft, I expected some adjustments to be needed, but none were!  It also works well in muffin tins as rolls (but at a lower temperature).

I love making bread. I found this was very easy to make and it smelled so incredible that my husband & I sliced a piece as soon as it came out of the oven! Put the second loaf in the freezer until we needed it. It's definitely one of our favorites! Glad to have came upon this Wonderful recipe!

This is my go to bread recipe for whenever I have company coming or want a good homemade bread to go with a meal. I love this recipe, it is a very simple bread recipe and has helped me when I started using different bread recipe's especially when I take a bread machine recipe and turn it into a regular recipe. I would love to thank who put this recipe on here it has been an inspiration in my life and lead to many more creative recipes. Plus given me the confidence to try more :).

We love this recipe. We make it all the time. It usually takes mine a lot longer than 30 minutes to rise the second time around so I usually make this in the morning to use for supper at night.

Its been my first time with this Amish white bread and I must say I am disappointed in both myself and this recipe. I can not think what could have gone wrong besides the yeast to activating or it being to dry. I downsized the yield by one half and even after 30 minutes,its still ugly and raw. My dough did not rise in the bowl,in the pan, or in the over. Its been 35 minutes now and it looks dry and hard. I hope you have better luck. Make sure you use the exact products. No AP flour or corn oil.
-ok I cut it in half and tried it,it tastes really bad.It was unbearable.I wish it could have worked.
Good luck though.

This bread was DELICIOUS! It was easy to slice for sandwiches (once it was cooled and spent five minutes in the freezer). Best bread I've made so far.

Mmmmmm... very good. I changed the servings to 12- so it only made one loaf. Did well, took longer to raise, and longer to cook, but very tasty!

I chose this recipe because of the amount of positive reviews it received. I have never made bread from scratch before - yup I am newbie. The instructions and video was very easy to follow. I made the bread and it came out great. My husband and daughter loved it and the three of us ate almost all of one of the loaves in an hour. One thing I did do differently because of the reviews I read --  reduced the sugar I used 1/2 cup instead.

1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour perfect!!!
I did with 3 cups of wheat and 3 cups of white. I have even used different sugar. It was perfect! I have done many times this recipe and every time no problem. Thanks to share this recipe.

Simply fantastic, fool-proof recipe.  Make sure your yeast is fresh, or you'll get bread that is too dense, and my have a funny taste.  Fantastic for sandwiches, toasting, or french toast.

I love this recipe.  I personally like dense breads.  Easy to make and added a touch of my own take on it, by warming a little bit of honey and making a glaze on top.  Went over well with my friend too.  Delicious!

I, too, thought this recipe was fantastic. Density was perfect. I could cut thin or thick slices easily. I used half the sugar called for which was perfect for us. I would like to try it as cinnamon rolls using all the sugar called for. Good recipe. Will use it often.

Amazing bread, according to my husband and kid. I took the second loaf, rolled it out and put a paste of cinnamon, butter and sugar on it and rolled it up to make cinnamon swirl bread.
Mine took several hours to rise properly (maybe my yeast??) and its not good for much more than toast or french toast by the second day.
Totally worth the effort of breadmaking. 
By the way, I just all-purpose flour and worked just fine!

Making this for the second time today. By far the best white bread recipe so far. Not nearly as dry as others and lasted a good 4 days. Nice texture. I like fairly dense bread. This was a high, soft and slightly dense bread. I do like sweet bread but I cut back to just under a half a cup of sugar.

Yum! My first time baking bread, and it turned out wonderful! I decreased the sugar by half like many reviewers suggested. If you're looking for a sweeter bread, I might leave it in, but if you're looking for a typical white bread, reducing the sugar is a good idea.

Thank you so much for this recipe!! I've always used my bread maker, which resulted in dense, dry bread. This was my first attempt at making bread with my kitchenaid mixer instead. I took the advice from others and cut the sugar in half and followed Breadguy's advice on how to make it in my mixer. I couldn't have asked for a better recipe. It is light, chewy and delicious! I will be making this again and again!

This was my first attempt at this recipe and it turned out PERFECTLY. I punched it down twice, and I let it raise most of the afternoon. That's the only thing I did differently than written, and only because I had the extra time while doing chores! This is a beautiful, delicious and EASY bread and I'd recommend it to ANYONE.

We love this bread!  We quit buying bread at the grocery store after I made this the first time.  It's so easy and delicious.  It doesn't necessarily need the full amount of sugar, it turns out fine if you cut it in half.  So so so good!!!

Can't believe I just made bread without a bread machine and it turned out FANTASTIC! Followed the recipe exactly as written. Two loaves barely lasted a week. Even my picky teen loved it. Such a healthier choice than store bought bread. I'll be making this weekly now. THANKS for sharing Peg. :)

great recipe, I have used it 3 times. twice using 2 single loaf pans and once with my new 16 x 4 x 4 Pullman pan I put the whole dough recipe in the Pullman and baked for 30 min @350 and it came out PERFECT! It is very sweet and soft with a super thin, soft crust perfect for sandwich bread, if you want it a little less sweet you can cut back the sugar and it still comes out perfect.

This recipe is so easy to make and comes out perfectly every time! I can't seem to keep it in the house for long. The family loves it! I follow the recipe exactly.

This ended up being too sweet, I wouldn't make this again. I love chewy, crusty, salty breads.

Easy and delicious.  Make this OFTEN.  Using an electric knife really helps to get evenly spaced slices that are straight. I also roll it out, add fillings (cinnamon raisin, cheddar jalepeno, apples, etc.), roll it back up and bake.  My favorite was cranberry orange pecan.  Zest some orange, a good helping of craisins, pecans, roll it up like a jelly roll and it's a delicious loaf!

I made this for dinner tonight, but I did not use all the sugar, and added some milk, and my family said it was the best bread I have ever made, and they said, please make it again, so I will keep this receipe for future baking. Thank you for the receipe, just have to do extra things for it and it is absolutely out of this world. Lisa

So easy and it turned out perfectly.  I did cut the sugar in almost half because I wanted a fluffier bread and it was just right.  I actually made colored bread by mixing all the liquids according to the directions, dividing it into thirds, adding food coloring to each, then adding the 1/3 of the flour to each bowl and following the directions for each batch.  At the dividing in half step after the first rise kneaded each batch a little, rolled into a rope, braided the 3 ropes, and then cut it in half and divided into 2 pans.  Next time I would cover the bread lightly with foil about halfway through to prevent some browning so the colors would show through better.

This special bread will be used for communion and it's hard to find a recipe that's not too crumbly, but this one works just right.

Very good bread! My daughter loves it! I will add that I only used 5 cups of flour though. 6 would have been too much.

This was wonderful bread!! Had to hide a loaf of the second batch in as many days so I could get some! Used clarified butter in the place of the oil. Don't know if it made any difference but it sure was good. Will try the vegetable oil next time. Also took another reviewers suggestion and made cinnamon rolls out of half the first batch and they fought over the leftovers!! Made it in the KA followed regular bread dough instructions and it worked perfect. Only bread from now on. Loved the slightly sweet taste.

This bread is absolutely delicious!  The entire family is eating it right now.  I did not alter the recipe at all.  Even my 94 y/o mother (who has been a wonderful baker all her life) just said, "this bread is great!"  Very easy.  Shoo-fly pie is in the oven now.

Took two tries to nail it down but thanks to the comments, I was able to have some delicious sandwich bread on the second batch.  Made a great sandwich for myself and took a nap.

I love this recipe and will definitely make it again! It is very easy, even for a novice (like me) and tastes delicious. My family enjoyed it with just a little butter while still warm from the oven. The only thing I did different was I skipped the loaf pan and did 2 hand formed loaves. Even my picky husband absolutely loved this bread!

This is so simple to make and comes out great. This is my "Go to" bread now. I added a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten and the bread came out even softer, lighter and higher than before.
Too simple to NOT make several times a week. No more store bought bread for us!

Very good white bread recipe!  I just made one loaf and used my bread machine to make the dough (just put the ingredients in the order suggested for my machine and set it on the dough cycle), then shaped it, let it rise in the pan, and baked it.  I will say that it is too sweet to use as regular sandwich bread, when I made a second loaf I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  Overall, a great recipe!

Very good bread recipe. It's always a good idea to crank up the room temperature (about 75 F or higher) when making bread to help the yeast work well, so it was my fault that it did not end up as good as it could have, but the taste is great.

I tried this recipe last night after having a craving for fresh baked bread. I read a bunch of reviews and cut down the sugar to just over 1/4 cup. 

Made exactly two loaves! Thanks for the recipe.

This bread reminds me of Hawaiian bread because it is sweet.  It is very soft and indulgent.  If you want a crusty bread, keep looking, but if you want something sweet and dense YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!!!

This is the easiest bread recipe.  It also took me three tries to get the yeast right.  I think my kitchen is too cool, though, because the dough did not rise well in the loaf pans.

Just made this up for my family and they instintly fell in love with it. Thankfully I read some of the reviews and saw how folks felt it was to sweet. To avoid that I just used enough sugar to get the yeast going. Seeing as how I only have 1 bread pan I did the second loaf on my cast-iron griddle just rolled and shaped out like a loaf and it did very well like that. This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I will recommend this recipe to others as well as continue using it myself.

I make this recipe ALL the time.  My family has sworn off store bought bread.  It has a soft texture and is perfect for sandwiches.  One of the few recipes I've had to make NO changes too!

A really great and easy recipe.  I bake this at least once a week, my hubby likes it so much that one of the loaves is usually gone before it cools!

This bread was fantastic! The only thing that I do different is to rub butter on top of the bread right out of the oven. This way the top stays soft!

Decent recipe, but way too sweet. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, and it turned out fairly well but still a little sweet. I may try this again with 1/3 cup or even less sugar. Unlike some, I did not find it to be too dense.

The bread turned out very good, however I only used about 4-1/2 cups of flour and 1/3 cup of sugar.  I used my kitchen aid mixer and it was so easy!  The bread was very light and had a fabulous flavor.  I will definitely make again.

My first attempt in making a bread. Very easy to make but the bread tasted yeasty. I left the bread in the pan for about 15 mins before cooling down on the wire rack and the base was a bit soggy. As the recipe didn't mention whether to turn out the bread immediately or wait for it to cool down. Will try again and see if it turns out better.

I used unbleached all purpose flour, about 2 tbsp of olive oil + 1tbsp for rising bowl, about 2 cups of distilled water, 1 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/2 cup of organic sugar. Used less than 6 cups of unbleached all purpose flour.
made the dough just like I would make a pizza dough with a 3 hour rise time (1 hour each). rolled the dough out with 
rolling pin and rolled it back up like a cinnamon roll. Cut three slits in loaf and let it rise in bread pan covered with towel for a hour and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. side note, it may come out better if bread flour is used.

Made as directed with the exception of brushing with honey butter the last 5 minutes of baking. Worked wonderfully for rolls! This is a dense bread recipe so make sure you (at least) let it double in size or it will turn out too heavy. Delicious!

This is a great recipe. It is very easy and delicious. I am a novice bread maker and it worked out very well. I did cut the sugar  in half. I have made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  I have also used 4 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of all purpose whole wheat flour and it worked out fine. Using 6 cups of  bread flour the loaves have a lot of loft and raise really quite high. When you use part whole wheat flour they don't raise quite as high, which I thought was a bit better. I find that the recipe quantity is also good for making one loaf and one pan of cinnamon buns. My husband loved this bread and so did my kids. From now on I will try to bake bread instead of buying store-bought. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Thank you for making my first baking of loaf bread an excellent one. This recipe was perfect and my kids and husband love the bread. I will probably try less sugar next time so it comes out fluffier, but on the whole excellent bread. I will never run out again.

This bread is super easy to make. The more you knead this dough, the denser it will be. If your dough is tough, you've kneaded too much! I make two loaves every other month for homemade french toast- I wrap up the slices individually and freeze them for easy breakfasts. I do go lighter on the sugar than what this recipe calls for, as it is a pretty sweet bread.

This bread has turned me into a bread baker. It's an excellent recipe to cut your bread baking teeth on. Since trying it years ago I've made many other recipes but always come back to this one as it is both easy and delicious.

My family loved this bread. It was similar to Hawaiian bread and I cut back on the sugar a bit.

I am making this for the 2nd time. One loaf will be plain and other loaf will be cinnamon raisin. (I did reduce white sugar to 1/3 cup.) I'm going to divide dough in half, sprinkle one half with cinnamon, raisins and a little brown sugar and then knead. The first time I sprinkled with cinnamon & raisins *after* kneading and rolled it up as one reviewer said she did. But this resulted in only a small area of cinnamon raisin in the middle of the loaf and I'd prefer it spread out throughout each slice. Thanks for this delicious and versatile recipe!

Very good, delicate (fairly sweet) white bread. Would probably taste better made with butter, as it lacks flavor. Enjoyed it and will make again! Thanks for recipe.

It was very good, but I thought a bit too sweet and heavy. Next time I'll cut down on the sugar and brush it with some egg too to make it shine.

I made this bread with my class when learning about pioneers. We only put 2 tbsp of sugar in each batch based on previous reviews, and rather than using loaf pans, we shaped them into thick loaves. The bread turned out great - nice crispy crust with a super soft inside and not too dense at all. The kiddos loved it - especially with the freshly made butter that they shook up while waiting for the bread to bake!

This is the best bread I have ever made! It isn't dense and tastes a lot like store bought bread, but better! Will make again everytime we run out of it!

I love making my own bread, and this recipe is a keeper! I have tried TONS of other ecipes, and none of the others have risen, puffed, and tasted like this bread! Definately a keep! I made a loaf of breaf and then the other half was used to make rolls. Both turned out equally well! For a soft crust on your bread, when it comes out of the oven: rub a stick of butter on the top. Yum!

Love this recipe! My dough took a little longer to rise, but I waited it out  and  had perfect results. I used  a quarter cup of sugar as someone else suggested. I now make my own bread instead of buying!

This is my go-to bread recipe.  It turns out perfect every time, it's easy, and it tastes great.  It is a sweet white bread, so if you're looking for a plainer taste, just cut the sugar by half, but I personally prefer the sweetness.

Recipe was perfect as is. I prefer my bread slightly sweet and made no changes. Brushed risen dough with melted butter prior to baking. Couldn't have turned out better. Also, it calls for a well oiled pan, and it really isn't kidding. Make sure you don't skimp on the oil, or it will stick in the corners.

Meh.  Not sure if I should be blaming how the recipe was posted or how allrecipes corrected the ingredients per serving size requested, but I attempted to do 12 servings instead of 24.  When following the recipe the way it was suggested it was way too wet to the point that the consistency was comparable to pancake batter.  I added probably 1-2 more cups of flour to get the dough going and I think that may not have even been enough.

I let the bread rise for 2 hours the first round and 1 hour once in the bread pan.  Once in the oven it didn't rise very well, I'd say the height was probably 1/2 as high as a normal loaf of bread.  It was pretty yeasty and very sweet.  30 minutes was also not enough baking time - there were pockets throughout the loaf that were not fully cooked.  

I've baked quite a few loaves of bread so I'm not sure it was my fault how it turned out.  My husband said he liked it, and I'm certainly going to eat it, but I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Simple and easy to make white bread.  Don't let it rise too long like I did the first time I made it or it will get too porous.

Me and my little 8 year old cousin tried this
 to tonight. I thought it would be a fun project for us to do together to go along with soup on a cold rainy fall day. It turned out so good. We had fun making it and even more fun eating it.

This is a great and easy bread recipe.  I have recommended it to people that are baking bread from scratch for the first time due to its simplicity and ease. Mind you, I've only been making bread from scratch for about 18 months.

 A word of caution though, watch your measures and proof your yeast as suggested. I might have been a little 'happy' with the sugar the first few times that I made made this myself as it was sweeter than I expected. Otherwise it is a great all around sandwich/white loaf!

Just like the bread I remember making with my grandmother as a child. Absolutely delicious and super easy to make! I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I dumped in a whole package of instant rise yeast instead of measuring (was only making one loaf and didn't want a little left over) and I added the flour a half cup at a time until the consistency was right as I kneaded it, I think I only used 2.5 cups. Amazing recipe and will definitely be making again!

What an awesome recipe! I wasn't sure if I was doing it right because there was a lot of loose flour when I was mixing it, and it was quite dry. so I added a cup of buttermilk. It took much longer than 20 minutes to prepare. I waited much more than 10 minutes (about 30) for the yeast to "proof" --- which I didn't know what that meant. Read the back of the yeast package. It didn't foam as much as I thought it was supposed to. Maybe someone can help me understand what "proof" means and what it looks like. 

Anyway, I decided to start kneading it and did so for 10 minutes. The consistency was fine. Then it didn't rise as much as other recipes have. It was supposed rise one inch above the pan, it barely cleared after I let it sit for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, I put it in the oven for 30 minutes. When it was ready, I pulled out of the oven, the most beautiful loaves of bread!!!  After it cooled, I sliced it to sandwich sized pieces and made a PB & J with milk. I have to say it was heavenly. I think adding buttermilk reduced the sweetness and added to the awesomeness. 

I'll be making this recipe every week. Thank you for sharing it!!!

My family absolutely LOVES this bread... We don't have a whole lot of money, so I decided to start making bread to save us from having to go buy it. I cut the recipe in half and made a loaf, but my loaf pan was too small and it came out pretty weird looking. >.> On my second try I cut the recipe in half, then cut the dough in half. I got two beautiful small loaves, one of which I kept for me and my boyfriend. The other I gave to his sister, and now I've been recruited to make all the bread for Thanksgiving. O.O Our 4-year old niece doesn't like bread, but with this recipe she'll sneak over and steal more when she thinks no one is looking. It's delightfully sweet without being overwhelming and goes great with so many other foods - we've had it with soup, chili, even used a few slices in place of hamburger buns! I recommend it for anybody who likes tasty, thick, delicious bread.

This is easily my second favorite bread recipe. It never dissapoints me and although some people find it too sweet, I really like the sweetness it has, but if I am making it for sandwich bread I just omit most of the sugar and it turns out just as great.

As a reluctant baker (and a very bad one), this recipe was the first yeast bread I've ever sucessfully made. I had no clue there was a special flour for bread...I followed the recipe almost religiously (I did lessen the amount of sugar a touch) and it came out beautiful and perfect. thanks for a great recipe...The only suggestion I have would would be to give novice bakers like myself a little more information on how long to knead the dough. I used my recently acquired KitchenAid mixer and it told me to use the dough hook on it for 5-6 minutes.

I was looking for a simple homemade bread recipe for my first foray into bread making and this recipe fit the bill perfectly. The directions were easy to follow and I the outcome was great (I may never buy store bought bread again). 

Like suggested by others, I used less than the recommended amount of sugar and the bread came out wonderfully.  But I think I'll make it with the recommended sugar next time, just to gauge the difference.

This is the first bread that I ever made from scratch. The directions were easy to follow and the bread turned out perfectly! This bread is so good that it's delicious to eat all by itself. Wonderful!

I make this often :)  I mix up the dough in the bread machine then rise/bake in the oven.  Most recently, I rolled in some sugar and cinnamon to make cinnamon bread...today I will add some Chopped apples, as we just got back from the orchard.  This is my 'go-to' bread for my girls' lunch!  Do be aware that the dough is SUPER sticky! If you knead by hand, use enough flour.  I've even used 1C of cake flour for a more delicate dessert bread....Use this one again and again!

fYi: Amish bread is on the sweet-side...it's more of a "friendship" or breakfast bread. 6 cups of sifted (always sift) is way too much even with kneeding. I used a generous  4.5 cups total...and made sure to use bread flour, not all purpose. I also used a whole packet of yeast. We liked it. 6 yr old went crazy for it toasted w/ strawberry preserves.

Well, this is just wonderful bread!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly.  I did have to lower the temperature of my oven and allow the bread to bake for an additional 5 minutes, as it was still a bit doughy in the middle after the 30 minute bake time.  Tonight I just served it sliced and buttered, still hot from the oven and it was sooo yummy.  I am sure it is going to make great sandwich bread too.  I got a tip from a friend here on AR (thank you Keri!) to let it rise a third time before baking, and I will try that the next time I make it...which will be soon!  Thanks for a great recipe Peg :)

I was looking for a go-to bread for my customers. I have a tiny home kitchen business supplying neighbors with breads and cakes. I used it yesterday to make two fruit and nut breads and two cinnamon swirl breads. I halved this recipe, but to get two loaves of each the original amounts should be used as seen here.

for those of you who are having trouble watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbU7hEw7wNU&list=FLw2yp_CgP9yJpiPnt42PUTw&index=2&feature=plpp_video   

she is making the same bread but with less sugar. this help me out a lot (and i just made it for the first time today)..also a good tip i was told was to heat a cup of water in the microwave for two minutes, push to back or side..just to make room for dough in bowl or loaf pan. leave the door close for 30 minutes and your dough would rise perfectly.. ( by the way this tip is good for people who has cold kitchens like me)

Easy to make and even easier to eat!  IF there are leftovers it makes great bread for pb&j sandwiches for kids lunches since it is dense and holds up well.

Made it exactly by the recipe and it is Wonderful!! So much better than anything that has come out of my bread machine. And yes, it is somewhat sweet, but my family loves it just like it is. It is not too dense, just right for great sandwich bread and slices nicely too with good crust. All the reviews are right, this is definitely a keeper.

Years ago, I bought a bread machine and swore off of hand-making bread.  This recipe has converted me back!  It is so easy to put together and is perfect for everything from simple buttered bread, to sandwiches to french toast.  I no longer purchase bread at the grocery store.  Great recipe, Peg!

*Update - I was having trouble with sandwich slices falling apart.  After some research indicating that more kneading leads to a denser bread, I now knead this bread for an extra 8 minutes after the first rise.  I had only been kneading for a couple minutes and the extra kneading time yielded a loaf that was still deliciously tender, but with slices that held together for sandwiches.  No more store-bought bread for this family!

Excellent recipe and very simple to make. We use slightly less sugar, and have added seeds/spices, etc. to one or both loaves after the first rise. 
Perfect staple recipe, and is enjoyed by everyone in our family.
Thanks for posting!

Excellent Bread, loved it! Thank you for this awesome recipe. I made it as is and then another batch, I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, for the diabetics in family.  It did lend to be fluffier and not near as sweet or dense as the original recipe. We so enjoyed both ways. I did find that keeping the Temp of room @65* did make a difference. Make sure NO Cool breezes, or windows open near your cooking area, andbe sure not to have the area raising bread above 115* the yeast will die for certain! On second batch I turned oven on for about 3 minutes, turned it off opened door for 2 minutes, placed a pan of very warm water on bottom shelf then placed bread on middle rack to rise. Rose very quickly but evenly and such a smooth even top of loaf was my result. Like this method of rising also. I did find that it makes a big difference when making sure the dough is well oiled when readying to rise first time. Be sure to roll adequately in dish so well oiled all around.

AMAZING!  I learned to bake bread using this recipe, and even though I've tried many other recipes, I always come back to this one.  Whether for a slightly heavy free form loaf to pull apart for fondu, shape into roles, make into monkey bread or cinnamon rolls, or for the loaf pan, when cut after completely cooled this is our sandwich bread.  I usually switch out half of the flour with whole wheat, and my kids love it, and they usually frown at store bought wheat bread.

Sooo Good, I used 2 cups of hard white wheat that I ground and 4 cups of Unbleached flour. Everything else was the same.  I used my stand mixer with dough hook set 2 for 3 minutes then let rest for about 5 minutes then let the mixer go for 5-6 more minutes. The loaves turned out amazing. Yum!

This makes beautiful, soft, fluffy loaves. I tiny bit sweet for my taste, so I may cut some of the sugar next time. I also brushed the top with some melted butter to help with browning. Other than that, I highly recommend.

I love this recipe. When i make bread with it, I am going to try sifting it to see if it lightenes. other then that.. I use this for biscuits, pizza dough, cinnimon rolls... which is amazing! I only use half the amount of sugar though and it tastes great. Have this written down in my family recipe book :D

I use this recipe for all of my bread.  Bread making takes a little practice, and the amount of flour may vary!  My husband followed the ingredients precisely, and ended up with bricks.  If you're ending up with a dense bread, you're probably overworking it, or working in too much flour, by adding the full 6 cups.  It's important to follow step 2, and add in one cup at a time, until the dough isn't sticky, but is still stretchy.  Usually, I end up with 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 cups of flour actually IN the dough, and the rest just to flour the surface.  Makes for a much fluffier loaf, when you don't add quite so much flour.

This is my standard "go-to" bread recipe for years. It is simple to make and delicious. My kids ask me to make this into cloverleaf rolls just to snack on or to put in their lunches because they love it so much.

I'm very pleased with this recipe - I've been using it to make slider rolls and they're a big hit.   After reading the reviews I made two changes.  I DECREASED the sugar to half a cup, and INCREASED  the salt by a teaspoon.  Perfect!

This recipe is simple and DELICIOUS, how cool is that??  Just follow the recipe. I've been baking breads for years and this is my "go-to" when I want bread pretty quick. Folks will be begging for a loaf once they try it, so watch out! The only difference I do to this recipe is to add a little less sugar. But either way this recipe is GREAT!!  Thank you ever so much!!

Excellent recipe, I had made bread frequently years ago, but, not for about a decade. The 1st time I made I followed the recipe to a T, it was very good, but a little sweet, on my second attempt I only used 1/4 cup of sugar which I preferred, keeps very well double-bagged in freezer bags, mine lasted a week with no issues.

This recipe is spot on! Since I first found this recipe a month ago, I now make it on Mondays and Thursday for my household. We no longer buy bread from the store. I use just a tad less sugar than the recipe calls for and its perfect for us. For hamburger, hot dog and dinner I make it AS IS. This is a no fail recipe. Turns out EVERY time. Do not overknead or your bread will be dense and will not rise very high.

This recipe is so easy and cheap!  Very few ingredients!  I love that it uses oil instead of butter because I always have oil.  It's a great soft bread.  I always use all purpose flour and it's great!  The bread is ever so slightly chewy, but nice and soft.  Good sandwich bread... or anything bread, really.  I always let mine cool enough to handle, then put it in a sealed plastic container to keep the crust moist as it cools, then I store it in same container or a ziplock bag or an washed bread bag with a twist tie.  So, I don't know how the crust is naturally.  I also have to bake mine on the bottom rack.  The middle makes the top too brown.  Today I used this recipe to make cinnamon swirl bread.  I just rolled out the dough after the first rise to put on butter, cinnamon and sugar, then rolled it back up into a loaf and did the second rise. Really easy modification. Made two loaves and gave one to the three college students living above us. They were so excited! It’s delicious!

This is a good recipe for sweet white bread.  I made one change to it, however.  Instead of 2 cups of water, I used 1 cup of water and 1 cup of milk because I prefer to make my breads with milk.  I think the milk makes a better bread.

Made per recipe, turned out just perfect! Really easy to make. I did not use a mixer. Quick rise time.
Only baked it for 23 minutes. Must be my oven. If it smells wonderful, check to see if it is done. Sounds solid when tapped. Really quick, easy recipe.

I have made this bread about 5 times now, and it turns out consistently great each time. Measurements are dead on.  I also add a cup of white whole wheat for a bit of fiber. If you use more than a cup of ww flour, then be sure to use more yeast or vital yeast so it still rises nicely.  Good white bread, a touch of sweetness, but not overpowering or cloying.  Slices well and is great moist sandwich bread, that is, if you have any left after your family eats it fresh & warm from the oven, of course!

The recipe is very basic and somewhat forgiving. My first attempt yielded loaves that were a tad too dense. When I tried again, instead of scooping flour with the one-cup measure, I weighed the amount instead. Scooping tends to pack the flour and usually you get 10-15% more than intended. Some baking web sights list all purpose flour as 4.5 ounces per cup. The recipe calls for 6 cups, so I weighted out 1 pound, 11 oz. The bread came out PERFECT. I've tried using shortening instead of oil, not much difference, I also like to use an egg wash of 1 egg and 2 tablespoons of milk - it gives a nice dark crust.  When baking I try to confirm if its done by using a temp probe or long meat thermometer. I usually try for 195-200 deg F about mid-loaf. It seems just a tad moist but if I let it rest for an hour and cool completely it turns out fine.

Fabulous recipe and most delicious white bread yet. Just getting back into baking breads after a 20 year haitus. Thank you Mr. Breadguy for your Kitchenaid directions except that I started with 4 cups of flour and then gradually added the rest 1/2 cup at a time.  Followed suggestions from others to cut back the sugar and used just 2 Tbsp. Light, moist, and wonderfully palate satisfying. Came out just perfect! This recipe will permanently replace my other white bread recipes. I intend to try some of the other very helpful variations posted! Thank you all!

I made this bread today and my family ate an entire loaf during dinner!  They loved it.  I didn't read any reviews before making it and made the recipe as directed and it turned out perfect just the way it is.  Light and fluffy and sweet.  We ate it plain and with butter and honey.  YUM!  Thanks for a great bread recipe.

Just made up a batch and YUM.  I did 'modify' the recipe by using 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 3 cups of bread flour.  I'm sure my texture was impacted, but it's still great bread!

I am sure this recipe is great, but this is the second time I made this using the bread machine and it did not turn out like everyone said. I am sure I did something wrong but not sure what though. I cut down the recipe in half, cut down on sugar like others suggested, but the loaf came out really hard outside and not soft but tough on the inside, not sure what I did wrong, please help.

Well, it is good bread, but mine cracked on the sides and the bottom didn't brown.  I will give it another try.  I don't usually make white bread but this was good and will definitely keep trying it until I get it right.  I feel like the dough was too dry and that is why it cracked.  It taste moist and fluffy, and not too sweet for use at all.

I did this recipe in my bread machine and it turned out wonderful! Everyone raves about it and my children flock around the bread machine until it is done. Needless to say it doesnt last and if I don't make 2 loaves back to back then it is gone by the next day. I also cut the recipe down to 12 servings and put my machine on a 1.5 loaf setting. Throwing it in my bread machine cuts down on all of the time and work and with 3 kids I definitely need an short cut I can find. LOVE this recipe and will continue to make it over all others.

This bread is absolutely delicious!  The only problem I have - which is not a big one - is that it tastes like a type of sweet bread.  So, if you are wanting regular white bread, cut the sugar down to 1/3 c. It's and excellent sweet bread, though!  I've also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and about a cup of cranraisins to this recipe & my family loved it!

Easy easy bread!  I make this every weekend because our son has food allergies and cannot have store bought bread.  I tweak the sugar back to 1/2 cup but we all loved it with the 2/3 cup.  This bread has a really soft crust!

I have been baking for many years and baking all kins of breads and today I bake this bread and  my boys said it is the best bread they ever had!
I had few changes,
I used All-purpose  flour because I did not have bread flour 
used 1/2 cup of oil, I think next time I will use butter instead  of oil because I think will give a better buttery flavor .
Great recipe thank you for posting

I have made this bread five or six times now, and it is perfect every time. I do decrease the amount of sugar to about two teaspoons, just enough to proof the yeast well, but that is a matter of preference-we don't like the sweet bread as much. I don't know how well this keeps because it is usually gone within a day!

I,m not much of a bread baker but I thought I would give this a go. I thought it turned out great, my husband thought it should have risen more. I think I could get 3 loafs from this and let them rise more. I did add only 1/3 cup sugar and its perfect.
I will definitely be using this recipe from now on. I want to try adding some different spices to it

This recipe will always be in my repertoire!  I made one loaf for dinner to try it out since I just started making bread.  The whole loaf disappeared!  The next  night, I made 2 loaves and the same thing happened.  Now we don't have to take the long drive to Dutch Country for delicious homemade bread.  Thank you so much!

A bit too sweet. I cut down the sugar to 1/3 and it was perfect. I mixed the dough in my breadmaker and divided into 2 loaf pans. Turned out very good!

This was quick to make. I took it to a dinner party and got good reviews. My husband and I didn't think it had much flavor though. Makes a good piece of toast. Rated this a 4 because of what people thought at the dinner party.

Unbelievably great texture!  Followed previous advice for making with my KitchenAid.  The only thing I changed was cutting the sugar down to 1/3 c. and upping the salt to 2t.  Tomorrow I plan to make cinnamon raisin bread and will use the full 2/3 c. sugar.  This is a must try recipe!

This was the first bread I ever made and it was AMAZING! I had no complaints! I even messed up (I missed the part about letting it rise once you put it in the pans 1 inch) and it still came out awesome. I am a new cook and wife, and my hubby was so pleased. He said the smell of the house was just like a bakery and the bread was so good he brought the second loaf to work to impress his co workers! Thanks!

AMAZING ! I will never make bread in a Bread machine again !  This was the easiest Bread recipe ever !! Made it for the first time today.  I cut the sugar in half as others had done based on their reviews and it was so fluffy and light and a great taste.  The only thing i did differently was let it rise for 2 hours instead of an hour.

Great recipe, easy to make, the texture is wonderful.  The family woke up this morning to the smell of fresh-baked bread.  This will definitely be my go recipe for bread in the future.

This recipe helped me to make the best bread ive ever made up to date. it is so so so very soft and yummy! NOt a brick like the past occasional recipes for loafs ive made. I used "W-R" Presifted Bread Flour. Im sure any bread flour would do, you can use the normal kind im sure but i think the bread flour makes the loaf softer because it is presifted a bunch

I love this bread recipe! The only change I made is substituting 1/2 cup of honey instead of the 2/3 cup of sugar. 
It butters perfectly - I hate breaking my bread apart when I try to butter it... thank you for sharing this recipe!

This makes nice loaves - but they are way too sweet for my taste.  I will try cutting the sugar in half as some have suggested.  The bread does make nice breakfast toast.

My Father and uncles all owned bakeries and this recipe is spot on. The dough felt a little tough coming off the dough hook but Presto it baked 2 beautiful loaves.

made twice so far. 1st time followed recipe and it was a little more dense than I liked, but tasted great. 2nd time took the advice of another reviewer and reduced the sugar. came out perfect, soft delish bread. I would suggest reducing the sugar if you want something lighter. also cheated and used the bread machine for the kneeding and rising then stuck in the oven for 30 min. and it was perfect.

I had a little hiccup with my yeast so my expectations were lowered... however I was surprised to see a perfect loaf come out of the oven. It tastes divine with a little bit of raspberry jelly on it... toasted, untoasted... I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also went ahead and made a few cinnamon buns instead of the two loaves. My husband quickly demolished three of them. I don't necessarily prefer them over my normal cinnamon bun recipe, but they were a nice option as I knew there was no way the two of us would finish off two loaves of bread in a few days. Will definitely be making this recipe again, hopefully with a little better luck with the yeast!

It was my first attempt making bread and it turn out so great. I have a white bread and a cinamon bread and they are both AWESOME !

I was so scared of making bread, but this was really easy.

I used 1/3 c. sugar, olive oil, and AP flour.

YUM! I halved the recipe. Our oven's on the fritz so I baked this on our grill. It took just under 20 mins with the two outside burners on med & the 2 inside burners off. The bread came out fluffy, moist and golden on top. I live at a high altitude and was surprised at how well this recipe turned out. I usually bake bread every week and this has turned out the best, so far (other than sourdough using my grandma's starter- which cannot be beaten or duplicated ;)  )

This is the recipe for white bread I have been looking for. The crust is not too think, and is even better than the side with no crust, and the inside is incredibly soft. Even my 15 year old loves it!!!!

This is the first time I've made a successful loaf of bread!! And trust me, I've been trying for about 8 years. I used about half a cup less flour than it called for, but everything else I followed word for word. Perfect!!!

Great quick recipe! I have baked bread several times in the past and this one is by far the easiest to do. One quick variation that I did on a second batch was to sub the vegetable oil for coconut oil and it is fabulous! Great thing about this recipe is you can experiment so easily!

I tried this recipe while cooking meals for some men that were helping my husband re-roof our house.  They loved it!  My family loved it too, so I've made it several times, and they keep asking for it.

I have made this bread multiple times since discovering it on allrecipes, and everybody loves it.  I haven't found it too sweet at all, personally.  For those who state it is dense/not fluffy, I suspect the issue is not letting the bread rise enough.  I check it after the given time, but find I need to let it rise longer to double in size (initial rising) and to later rise to 1" above the pan.  I find the loaves need to rise 45 minutes prior to being put in the oven.  But, I go by how it looks not a set time.  I put a damp cloth over the bowl and loaf pans and set it/them in a small room that has a heating fan, so the room will be warm enough for adequate rising.  I liked the suggestion of brushing the top with butter before putting it in the oven, and have been doing that.  It's a great recipe, in my opinion.  Reminds me of bread I had as a child in Europe (grew up in the Air Force).

I thought this bread was very yummy.  Did not find it to be too sweet at all...although I love sweet things.  Made it just as directed except I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to do all the kneading.

I made six loaves of this bread today, it is super easy and comes out with a great light flavorful texture. On one loaf I brushed softened butter on the top prior to baking. That loaf didn't even have time to cool before my family devoured it. I also added 2T of cinnamon to one batch as a added flavor. It also came out great.

This was my first time baking bread.  I just got a new Kitchen Aid stand mixer and wanted to try it out.  First time I've cooked bread in 20 years.  This was SOOOOO good!  Hubby, kids, everyone loved it.  I follwed the recipe to a "T".  Used the amount of sugar it called for despite reviews calling for less.  It was perfect for us. This has made me want to bake bread regularly, it was so easy and good!

The family liked this bread a lot, but it was a little dense and dry for my liking. I guess I was looking for a fluffier bread. It did toast up nicely and with jam it was delicious. A nice tasting bread.

I've always failed at making bread- this is the first time I succeeded and I'm SO greatfull! I used 1/4 c sugar, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. We served it thickly sliced with peanut butter and pumpkin butter for a healthy fall snack - absolutely delicious!! We will be making this recipe for life and passing it down for the generations to come! Thank you so, so much Peg!

I've made this several times now, and I'm still perfecting my bread technique, but it still comes out great! I only give it 4 stars, though, because I highly recommend reducing the sugar at least by half. The first time, the taste and texture were NOTHING like Amish bread I've ever tasted! But with the sugar reduced, this is the perfect white bread. Just wait until you smell it! Mmmmm...

This is the best bread recipes ever. I have been using it and baking it for my family more than 100 times!!!It has become our staple. It's so much cheaper to bake at home! I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.

I made this bread last night and it was excellent!  I cut back on the sugar as was suggested by another reviewer, I used 1/4 cup.  The bread came out perfect, It tastes exactly like plain white bread and it slices up very nicely for sandwiches.

I love this recipe and use it over and over again.  I make bread for my neighbor, I use it for sandwiches, bread & butter/jam, pizza dough, rolls, etc.  It is super easy and all my friends love it.  I do use a little less sugar though.

This is a good bread recipe but it's WAY too sweet. The next time I make it I'm cutting the sugar in half. Other than that it came out great. It was very soft and moist, just like I like it :)

This is my first review.   I found this recipe about a week ago and have made it 4 times.  The bread is easy to make in the kitchen aid.  My family would rather have this then store bought bread.  I will definitely make again.

FANTASTIC!  Easiest, best bread I have ever made!  I only used half the sugar as others have suggested and got a great, traditional white loaf.  Making again already, the next day, because my family is begging for it!

I would definitely advise using less sugar, around 1/3 cups. Otherwise it tastes too sweet. All in all a very simple and delicious recipe.

My family loves this bread!  Including my 2-year-old, who doesn't like much of anything these days.  I only use 1/2 c sugar and between 5 and 5-1/2 c all purpose flour.  It comes out great, and a little less flour gives a softer bread with a moister crumb. This dough also makes great scones and rolls!

This is now the recipe I will always make for bread! I did add a little less sugar (1/3 cup) and I found 5 cups to be enough flour...fantstic taste and it did rise VERY well...we ate almost a whole loaf between my husband and I with dinner HAHA!

Turned out great!  I had too much flour so I ended up mixing in about 1 tsp extra of water.  I also took the recommendations and cut the sugar down to 1/4 c of sugar.  The middle turned out a smidge doughy but that could be from my oven or it didn't rise properly, house was pretty cold and I couldn't keep it warmer than 47 degrees.  Looking forward to eating both loaves!

Very good bread, but slightly sweet.  For my second batch, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it came out well balanced.  My dough ball doubled in 20 minutes 
(warm kitchen), speeding things up and coming out just fine.  I am going to stick with my lower sugar modification for future batches.

Made using kitchenaid.  Proofed yeast in warm bowl with water and sugar before adding the rest of ingrediants.  Kneaded on speed 2 for about 5 minutes and let rise half an hour first.  The second rise I did one hour.  Turned out perfect.  I also decreased the recipe to bake in 8x5 pans because my 9x5 were being borrowed.

This bread is quick, easy and delicious. I agree with other posters that reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup is a great way to make this bread fluffier and more like regular bread. I also find the recipe very easy to customize with herbs, cinnamon and apple, etc

This got a four because I did decrease the sugar.  I feel like it was perfect with about 3 teaspoons per loaf.  It came out of the oven about an hour ago and my husband and I have pretty much devoured it!!  I have never made any bread beside banana or zucchini.  I was nervous but it is SOOO yummy!  I never want to buy bread again!  Now I just need one of those bread containers for the countertop!! :)

I cut the recipe in half to make 1 loaf instead of two.  I didn't care for it too much - i felt it was too dense and too sweet.  Even if I cut down on the amount of sugar I'm not sure that would improve its taste - but then again there are so many variables in this recipe that I could have gotten wrong so I can't really blame the recipe for it.  Maybe I didn't proof the yeast long enough, maybe i didn't let the dough rise long enough etc etc - but either way, i don't think i will try this recipe again.  The bread was not bad, but i expected a softer, fluffier bread than the one I was left with.

I have made this recipe once and currently making it again. I followed the directions to a tee the first time and it turned out beautifully. My Homemade Bread anxiety is GONE. This recipe is perfect. I have substituted some of the Bread Flour for Wheat Flour. I am betting it will be delicious as well. I also decreased the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and it is just right.

wow, if I could give more stars, I would!  I mixed the full recipe in my bread maker, then split it in 2 - baked one in the bread maker, and the other in a bread pan.  both turned out perfectly and the texture is so beautiful - light and dense at the same time.  I do agree that it is a little sweet, so next time I'll use only half the amount.  thanks for the delicious recipe!

I made this for the first time last night. It turned out awesome! I didn't know there was a difference with bread flour and regular flour. But it didn't seem to make a difference that I used regular flour. I will make this again!

I think this is a wonderful and easy recipe. We will never have to buy bread again!  The only change we made to it was cutting the sugar in half. It tasted to sweet the first time. Also we let it rise for about and hour and 1/2 and that really helped. It really tastes great!

I love this recipe. The bread was nice and soft. I made a bunch of little mini loafs to make my 7 year old some mini peanut butter jelly sandwiches. She loved it! I ate a whole mini loaf myself. Yummm. I will be making more. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a super simple bread recipe! I have a sweet tooth, so I did add a wee bit more sugar. This was even a hit with my very picky boyfriend. The bread was all gone the same day I made it. I will definitely be baking this one again.

It was very very good.  I thought that it was not good with meat sandwiches because it was too sweet.  It tasted like Hawaiian bread.  I cut the sugar in half and it was PERFECT!!!  Thank you for submitting!

I made this bread, the first one I made in over 35 yrs, the last was with my Grandmother! I gave a loaf to my father and he said it tasted just like his mother's bread.  Let me tell you, that's a compliment! The bread is easy and tastes great!

This recipe is amazing! Just like Grandma used to make, and that is a HUGE compliment! I actually have some dough rising right now. It's the third time in two weeks that I have made this recipe. :o) I've given out a couple of loaves to my co-workers and my in-laws. The consensus is universal. Simple. Delicious. Perfect. I already have the recipe memorized! Can't get much easier then that. Thanks so much for sharing!

I have made this recipe time and time again, and it is always perfect! Thanks!  I have even substituted whole wheat flour for 60% of the flour and it still turned out.  I only need about 5 to 5 1/2 cups of flour most times.

I've tried different white bread recipes through the years and this recipe is by far the best. The texture and sweetness make this bread addictive. The loaves disappear before they have a chance to dry out, I'm actually waiting for that to happen so I can make bread pudding! Thank you for sharing Peg!

I thought most white bread recipes were pretty much the same (I'm a wheat bread lover) but this one proved me wrong.  Wow!  Tender crust, soft and moist inside.  This sweet bread is so good, it borders on being a dessert.  Doubling the recipe gave me four big, high loaves.

I have got to say that I have never been more impressed with a loaf of bread. I could hardly wait for it to cool down enough to slice a couple of pieces for my eagerly awaiting 6 year old. This was about 10 minutes ago. All but the heel's are gone now.  I did like some other reviewers and only put in 1/4 c sugar and when it came out of the oven I rubbed a little bit of butter on the top to make it shine.  Delicious. Thank you.

By far the BEST bread recipe ever!  The loaves were gone in a matter of minutes.  After reading other reviews, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup.  This was the perfect amount.  It had a hint of sweet, but wasn't overbearing.  LOVE IT!

Exceptionally Good!  I was wondering about this bread because it is so simple to make.  I was also a little worried about the amount of sugar in it BUT all my worries came to an end when we tasted the final product.  This bread is velvety inside and it is a little sweet (which I was surprised taking in consideration the amount of sugar the recipe calls for).  Amazing with butter and I think next time I am going to use a little bit less sugar (1/2 cup or less) and use it as sandwich bread.  Thank you for this recipe PEG!

I have literally made this bread hundreds of time and am never disappointed. It makes a great gift. With my family, the loaves never stay around long. I'd say it is best to eat it within 24 hours of making it!  I've varied the amount of sugar on several occasions with success. We live at a high altitude, but I'm never disappointed with how it rises and turns out. Yes, it's dense. Yes, it's sweet - but it's unbeatable for a tasty homemade treat.

The recipe is great...so much easier than others I have tried in the past and with a superior result. As is, the recipe will give you a dense, sweet bread. For a fluffer, less sweet version, I cut the sugar in half.

Made this last night and was very happy with how it turned out. The bread was not too dense or too sweet. In my opinion it tastes a lot like Hawiian Sweet Bread (one of my faves). My kids are all nuts over this recipe! Will make again!

If you have struggled to make a good looking and good tasting loaf of bread.  Then this bread is for you!  I made it just like the recipe except - I didn't have bread flour so I used regular flour and 1 Tablespoon of wheat gluten.  Also, I make it in the Kitchenaid, but I take it out at the very end and knead it by hand for 30 seconds.  I like to feel it to make sure it is the right consistency.  Enjoy

This recipe is beyond amazing!  It far surpasses 5 stars!!!!  This is the first time I have made bread and it turned out PERFECT!  I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't think it was too sweet.  I also used regular all purpose flour.  The bread rose sky high and when it came out, I rubbed butter over the top.  Beautiful and delicous!  This recipe is a definite KEEPER!!!  Okay, so I waited a day and made another batch, but this time I made cinnamon rolls out of it.  TO DIE FOR!!! They were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had!  They were so light and fluffy and melted in my mouth.  Everyone should use this recipe to make cinnamon rolls!!!!!  I want to shout to the rooftops how wonderful this bread recipe is!

Following the recipe closely gave a soft and dense bread that I will definitely make again. Great and simple recipe for white bread. It's better than the regular white bread that I get from stores.

Great recipe. I followed the suggestions of others and reduced the amount of sugar. I used 1/4 cup sugar. I also used 2t of salt instead of the 1.5 the recipe calls for. I let it rise more than double for the first rise. I had a very fluffy plain white bread that wasn't sweet at all. It is perfect for sandwhiches. Love it!

EXCELLENT, EASY RECIPE! Very tasty & fluffy. My family loved it. Every time I make this bread, one loaf is gone within the same day. Also great recipe for dinner rolls. Instead of making a loaf, simply shape & pinch into small size rolls. Egg wash makes the top of the loaf shiny & beautiful!

This recipe was overly sweet, but the loaves turned out well. I defiantly recommend reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup (Personally I think 1/3 would be plenty)

I used 1/2 cup of sugar and it had just the right sweetness for an all-purpose bread. It's great by itself with butter or for a sandwich.

I think this bread is good, maybe a little less sugar but still good. We also added Jalapeno and cheese to it.

Good basic bread recipe.  Kind of sweet.  I just used regular white flour and it worked fine - no bread flour here.  Tasty stuff! Easy and good!

This tasted very good, but was very time consuming.  I was also expecting it to be more like sandwich bread, but it wasn't.  It was a great bread to have with dinner, but would not have been good for a sandwich.

This bread really was amazing. It is a bit on the sweet side, but one of my favorite ways to eat traditional amish bread is with homemade jam, so it's pretty perfect. I can see it making excellent french toast as well. If I want bread specifically for sandwich making, I may cut the sugar a bit, but for a basic white bread recipe, this is wonderful!

It is good bread, but despite the rave reviews... My family is not gonna ask for it again. Its too dense not fluffy at all. A smidgen too sweet and doesn't have enough yeast in it. My family prefers fluffy breads, doesnt every one?

This bread is amazing. I had to cook it about 10 minutes more than it says, but the taste and texture of the bread is sweet and simple, fluffy, with a crunchy crust. Will definitely bake often!

This bread turned out amazing! I used my bread machine to do the mixing and first rise. Then I took it out formed it and then let it rise again. Then baked it the recommended time and it turned out great. My Family loved it. May try with less sugar next time as it is a little sweet.

This is my go-to recipe. I use it for rolls, and for bread. On occasion I add wheat flour (usually half wheat and half white). It is a wonderful bread and so easy to make. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent bread!  The first time I made it, it was gone in less than 12 hours (and there are only four of us).  It's delicious and sturdy, so it's great for sandwiches or just a snack. It works best if you make the suggested amount.  We tried doubling it and it was difficult to knead so the bread turned out kind of dry.

I like my bread to be a lot denser than this. While the taste was good, the texture came out a lot like hamburger buns (which I'll admit could be because I used partly bread flour and partly all-purpose). But if you're looking for a fluffy white bread, this is the recipe for you. Also, I would cut down a bit on the sugar.

Thanks for the great recipe, Peg! I failed the 1st time cos of the bad yeast but after reading on kneading, rising and with a new batch of instant yeast, I was successful the 2nd time! Made 1 loaf and 9 buns. Hubby said that they were very professional. =) A keeper definitely! =)

I started this bread at 6 a.m. and had hot steamy fresh bread two hours later!  My 5 year old eats it plain, my husband eats it with butter and makes sandwiches and I can't get enough of the aroma that lasts the entire day.  THIS BREAD WAS WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT CALLED FOR VERY FEW INGREDIENTS, MAKES WONDERFUL SANDWICH BREAD AND SMELLS DIVINE!!!  WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT FOR YEARS TO COME :)

I had amish bread a few years ago when touring thru Pennsylvania's Dutch Country. This recipe tastes the exact same. Its soft and fluffy, and delicious! Like other reviewers I used half the amount of sugar and it turned out fantastic. I had no issues with yeast or the dough raising.

This was the first bread recipe I ever tried, and I haven't moved on to making anything else-it's THAT good.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 of a cup which I think is plenty, and usually make a loaf with half of the dough and buns with the other.

Pretty simple, taste great  I did only use 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup. It was still slightly sweet, very yummy. Kids loved it. Will make again. Thank you for sharing

Came out awesome...like many others had suggested, I reduced the sugar by half and it was perfect... I used self rising flour. Most critical is letting the yeast do its work...some other reviews have the instructions, follow it, it's worth it!

First time bread baker. Loved the constancy of the bread (i even used all purpose flour) but i did not read the reviews before baking, and yes, using the recipes as is yields a much too sweet bread. Will make again, but with half the sugar. Awesome recipe though!

I decided to try it verbatim the first time, and I really enjoyed the way it turned out.  The sugar certainly was detectable in the finished product - to the point where next time I will cut it back as other reviewers have.  I did do one thing different though, I used a baking stone without bread pans.  I just shaped the dough after the rise into 2 loaves and baked them on stone that had preheated in the oven with a pan of water for moisture.  It was excellent!  The stone gave the bread a nice flat bottom while the lack of pan restriction gave the bread room to further rise while baking.  Sliced it made for delicious cinnamon toast.  I would certainly recommend this recipe to anyone.

I make this bread for my family all the time. They love it. It's a race to get the first warm slice when I take it out of the oven. I don't mess with the recipe AT ALL. It's perfect as is. Thanks for publishing !!

Thank you for the recipe, Peg. The bread loaves turned out wonderful and the taste was amazing. I did not mind how dense the bread was. Was the best white bread I have EVER tasted. Will be making more!

I love to cook/bake but I'm not very good at it at all. I found this recipe and thought it looked simple enough that maybe I wouldn't mess it up. My bread turned out perfect! It is just oh so good! I made half as much because I didn't want to waste too much of it if it didn't turn out very well but I will definitely be making this again with the full amount. My husband told me that it was much better than the loaf bread we get from the market.

I made this for the first time today, and it was absolutely scrumtious! I took everyone's advice, and only put in 1/3 cup sugar and it was perfect. My 2 kids and I just ate most of a loaf for dinner!

This is the easiest bread recipe I have ever made.  It is a bit dense, but great on a cold winter day with homemade soup. I did find the baking time of 30 minutes not long enough to bake the middle of the loaf completely.  I leave the bread in at least 55-60 minutes and never have an unbaked center.

Excellent recipe! Pretty easy too. I did it with sifted all purpose flour instead of bread flour and it turned out fine. However I didn't use all of the flour (prob. ended up being more like 5 1/2 cups). I also topped it with butter while it was oven.

NEVER in all my days trying to bake bread have I done any better than bake bricks.  Today I tried this recipe and was delighted at just how easy the whole process was.  My yeast proofed perfectly.  The flour was easy to mix, although I was able only to add 5 1/2 cups, and the kneading was a breeze!  The dough doubled in size in about 30 minutes and, for the first time EVER, the dough in the loaf pans actually looked like loaves.  I took everyones advice and used 1/4 cup of sugar and the end result was deeeelicious!!!  I've been wanting to stop buying bread at the bakery for years, and now I can.  This recipie is easy and delicious.  I can't believe I did this!  You've got to try it.

This is the first bread I've ever baked, and I must admit that it turned out a LOT better than I could have hoped for!  The softness of the texture was just perfect for me, and the crust was nice and tender as well.  Thank you so much!

Thanks so much for this recipe. I have made it a few times now; it is consistently delicious. It is so easy, and went perfectly with a bowl of piping hot chili. I included it in my recipe blog. Thanks for making me look like a real baker!

Absolutely delicious! But, I had to cut and eat it in squares, sort of like rolls, when I tried to slice it fell apart. But as long as I cut it in big chunks it stayed together and was great. I also had to bake for about 45 minutes on 350, not nearly done after 30 minutes. This bread is a little sweet which I prefer, but if you don't like sweet bread then you may want to cut back on sugar. Thanks for sharing Peg!

This bread is fantastic!  I love it plain but I also like to experiment.  My favorite is to divide the dough in half, and knead in a bag of dried cranberries, blueberries, and cherries.  Then add as many pecans as your family can afford (I love nuts).  Once everything is distributed well form into one loaf and use the other half of the dough for plain white bread.

I've been looking for a nice bread recipe for ages........and this one fit the bill!  Most bread recipes have ingredients that I never have on hand.....but not this one!  Excellent taste, texture and easy to follow directions.  Fun to make and smells like a dream while baking.  Husband ate an entire loaf by himself on my first attempt!  Now I keep several portions frozen for when I need them.  Great recipe!

Very good recipe. Easy. Bread is dense & slightly sweet. Never was able to use more than 5-1/2 cups flour. Takes longer to raise than indicated in recipe. Not a sandwich bread but a delicious dinner bread.

This is the best and tastiest bread I've made!  My husband LOVED it...and he is very picky about his bread!  The only changes I made were 1. I used half extra virgin olive oil and half canola oil in place of the vegetable oil and 2. I had some sour dough starter, so I replaced about 1/2 cup of the flour with 1 cup sour dough starter.  It was amazing.  My husband said I have found THE bread recipe and to keep doing it just like this!

This was a lot easier to make than I ever expected homemade bread to be.  I actually forgot an ingredient (salt) and it still turned out quite nicely.  I will be making this again.  :)

I don't know why I've never made bread before.  I think many years ago I tried and the yeast never worked and I just gave up because it seemed like a pain in the neck.  But this was so easy and turned out so delicious that now I am psyched about trying other breads.  Wow, was this good warm with some butter and strawberry jam!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fluffy and just mildly sweet, with a tender, crisp crust.

This recipe is wonderful & easy.  I reduce the sugar to 1/3 C. for the most part, but occasionally make a few loaves with a cinnamon swirl and leave the recipe as is - my two young children go absolutely bonkers over it!  I make it in an antique bread maker with a handcrank hook... cleanup is a breeze.  I've yet to have a batch fail.

Extremely easy and delicious. I tried using just 1/4 c of sugar the first time and it wasn't sweet enough so I stick to the 2/3c and it's very yummy and not too sweet at all in my opinion. Be patient with the yeast as some types take longer to proof than others. I put an egg wash on the loaves and they come out looking beautiful. This recipe is a keeper and the loaves make great gifts.

This was the EASIEST recipe for homemade bread ever!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated (even used my digital meat thermometer to make sure the water was 110 degrees). I have screwed bread up so many times by either underheating or overheating the water.  Yeast cells are very sensitive little boogers.  They do their fermentation job perfectly at 110 degrees.  I measured out 2 Tbsp of yeast which turned out to be almost 1 strip of the 3 linked yeast packets.

I love this recipe!! I took the advice of some other reviews and cut the sugar down to 1/3 and it's perfect for sandwich bread. I also like the original recipe with 2/3 sugar for when I want a sweeter bread. My whole family loves this bread so much, they beg me not to buy "store" bread anymore, lol. Since this recipe is so easy in the Kitchen Aid, their wishes might just come true!! Thanks Peg for this wonderful recipe!!

Only made one loaf using the bread machine to mix and rise the dough.  Kneaded and rolled out, added brown sugar, cinnamon, and plump raisins.  Rolled and let rise, baked for 28 minutes, but center wasn't done, put it back in for another 10 mins. covered with foil.  Delicious!  Next time more cinnamon and add frosting

My first time making regular white bread and I didn't ruin it! My bread was a little too dense for regular sandwiches (for my personal taste anyway), but it was great with butter and jam, and I also made delicious garlic bread out of it. I didn't get a chance to this time, but I suspect this would make a great bread for French Toast also.

my only change is to use 1/4c. sugar, and I also substitute 1 1/2 c. ww flour. I've stopped buying bread since discovering this recipe. I slice each loaf and freeze it so that it lasts longer.

Yesterday I attempted to make a non-quickbread style bread for the first time - and it turned out AMAZING!!!  The hardest part is proofing the yeast, but once you get past that it's super easy and soooooooooooo yummy!  My housemates loved it.  Last night I made the most scrumptious grilled cheese with the bread and this morning I had it with just a little strawberry jam and was in carbohydrate heaven!

OMG! This is some GOOD bread! My grandmother couldn't make a better tasting bread! I didn't change the amount of sugar and it tasted PERFECTLY! I will never buy store bought bread again! One problem is that there really wasn't enough dough for 2 loaves of bread. I just made one big loaf and it worked out perfectly. Kneading was quite important, as bits and pieces began falling off the already baked bread. I would be careful next time to keep the bread together in one piece.

This bread is excellent. I make lots of bread and this recipe will go to the top of my list due to ease in preparation and outstanding flavor!! I used my bread machine on "dough" setting. I put the water, oil, salt, and sugar in first. Added the flour, sprinkled on the yeast. I shaped into one 9x5 pan and three 5x3 pans. They turned out great!!

I tried out this recipe this afternoon and I must say it was delicious! The recipe was easy to follow and turned out great. One of the best bread recipes I have tried and will be my new go-to! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the amount of sugar - I only used 1/4 cup and it was the perfect amount.

I love this recipe.  I am a bread 'virgin'.  I had heard that bread was hard to make, but this recipe is awesome.  My yeast proofed well, my dough rose and ran over the edge of my ganny's wood bread bowl, and I was able to make a loaf and rolls.  It was light fluffy and sweet.  I substituted sugar for 1/4 cup of honey   it may be that the gods that be where nice to me, or the weather was right and wind was plowing from the right direction today, but first try was a hit.  Will deffinitly use this again

This bread surprised me. I cut the recipe in half, making one loaf, and cut back the sugar just a tad (used just under 1/4 cup rather than 1/3 cup). I use my bread machine to bake bread in, but make the dough by hand. The dough didn't rise very much on the second rise, but as soon as it started baking it completely filled my 2 lb loaf pan. I overcooked it a little, the crust is a little too thick, but that's my fault - I'm still getting used to the bake only function and timing it right. The bread tastes wonderful. It's great and it's milk free!

My first attempt at making bread...and success!  This recipe was easy to make (my 4 year old even helped), and it turned out beautifully!  My hubby has never seen me so excited "Look! the bread actually rose!). I wasn't sure about putting the yeast into the full amount of water and sugar as the packaging instructed to proof it in only 1/4 cup of water with 1 tsp sugar, but it worked.  I kept the dough in the oven with a hot bowl of water on the bottom rack to help make it rise faster.  I'll be making this bread again, maybe getting adding some rosemary, cinnamon or other herbs and spices to change things up a bit.

I used a bit less sugar only because I didn't want a sweet bread.  Great recipe!  I got two beautiful and tasty loaves.

A terrific basic white bread.  I was looking for something made without milk, and this was the perfect recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make! I did add a little bit less sugar as some reviewers suggested. I'm not a pro at baking bread and I didn't have any trouble making this recipie! It came out very nice.

Makes great bread by reducing the sugar to around 1/4 cup.  This recipe as is makes excellent dinner rolls!  Divide up the dough into about 20 - 24 pieces, and put in a 11 x 9 cake pan.

This is a great bread recipe. It is wonderful straight out of the oven. It was very easy to make anyone wanting to attempt to make bread this would be a good recipe to start with. The 4 star rating is because the bread is not so great the day after you make it. Like other reviewers if you are making this for guest make it the day of.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe the full 5 stars is because it isn't at its best the day after baking. This bread is phenomenal right out of the oven and for the rest of the day, but if you're making it for guests or something, plan to bake it the same day you'll be serving it. And if you have any leftovers the next day, they make marvelous french toast!  This bread is also exquisite made into cinnamon rolls!

I have never attempted baking any type of bread product from scratch in my life, now I wonder why.  This was very east and turned out very well.  I felt it was a little heavy compared to something you would buy in a bakery but heck for a virgin baker it was great.

I make this bread 2 or 3 times a week.  It's my family's favorite bread.  The recipe is super easy and I always get great results.  I've been making this consistently for about 9 months now and we are still just excited when a hot loaf comes out of the oven!

Amazing!  I am a very beginner cook and thought for sure I would screw this up.  My husband is also a very picky eater and he ate a lot.  I did change it up a little though.  I used whole wheat flour because it's all I had.  I also used mini loaf pans again, because it's all I had.  My family is already asking me to make it again.

Not only is it good bread but it makes a EXCELLENT cinnamon roll.  Used the Cinnabon recipe for the topping and filling and I have vowed to not make them again unless im giving all away and only saving one for myself.  The first time I made them I ate 4!

I am 100% positive that I could eat a whole loaf, with butter of course.  This is so good.  I have never had bread like this.  Wow, I can't even tell you how much we enjoyed it.  I used regular flour because that's all I had.

This was GREAT!  It's my first time making bread and it turned out wonderful.  I will never buy store-bought white bread again!  Like many others, I didn't want a sweet bread so I added 1 tablespoon of sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey.  I wasn't sure if I could do all honey...  Next time I'm going to try adding some whole wheat, maybe half, and all honey.  And I plan to make a loaf with cinnamon & raisins and that one I will make sweet!  : )  The only thing I would add to the recipe is a note that yeast can take 10-15 minutes to foam.  I read that from other reviewers beforehand, but if someone doesn't know...  Other than that it really is fool-proof!

Amazing! I have only made bread in my bread machine because I have always been too afraid of making bread. I decided to brave it...I am SO glad I did. Easy recipe and tastes so very good! I think next time I will try a little less sugar like others suggested. I would only do that to make it a little healthier, not because of the taste. GREAT RECIPE!

This is awesome bread!!  I only added 2 T. of sugar as I did not want a sweet bread as some other reviewers had stated.  The texture was great, the bread was dense, and it makes 2 beautiful loaves.  I wouldn't have a problem putting this bread on my holiday table as it is THAT good!!  It actually reminds me of the bread my grandmother used to make when I was little.  Try it....it is definitely worth the time it takes to make.  I used the instructions from another reviewer and made in in my kitchenaid.  Thanks so much for this new addition to my recipe box!!

A very good bread.  I had old yeast and a cool kitchen so I had to let it rise a looong time.  I did cut the sugar (I think in half) and I think it would have been to sweet for sandwich bread otherwise. Tasty with a good crumb and it made beautiful loaves.

My roommates devoured this bread and were begging me for the recipe.  It was a little bit sweet for my tastes so I will lower the sugar content next time I make it, but I will certainly make this again.

Very easy and tasty!  With half the dough, I made rolls and they turned out well after 30 minutes in the oven.  After 30 minutes, the loaf was still a bit doughy in the middle.  But still a fairly easy dough to make, since I'm used to using a breadmaker.

Great! First bread I have ever made and it was awesome. Someone commented after eating a warm slice fresh out of the oven, "This is probably the best bread I have ever had." Made a killer toasted cheese sandwich with chili!

I loved this bread. I was looking for a cheap and healthier option to store bought and found it.  This was only my second time ever making and everything turned out perfect.  The first time was 20 yrs ago.  It really helped to read this site @ proofing.  This reciep is fool proof -I put my salt in while proofing and my house was cool and bread still turn out delicious-it just took a little extra time to rise once I figured out it was too cool in the house.  My kids loved the taste and texture.  I didn't think it was too sweet or dense. We will be making this again.  Thanks Peg

I would reduce the sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  Otherwise, an excellent white bread.

I was inspired to try to bake my own bread by some advertisements I saw recently for a bread machine.  I was very surprised that I did so well with my first try on a yeast bread.  I kneaded the dough in my stand mixer according to the KitchenAid instructions in the manual.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I brushed the tops of the loaf with butter and baked in the oven with a cookie sheet filled with water.  The bread is a little sweet, but was delicious right out of the oven with a little butter.  Next time, I will decrease the sugar to three tablespoons.  I'll update my review with any changes.  I say cut the recipe in half and try it as is and then make any necessary adjustments thereafter.  UPDATE 4/6/11:  Made as is, except subed a stick of margarine for the oil.  Left first loaf as is.  For second loaf, rolled out then with rolling pin, added cheese and italian seasoning blend and rolled back up.  Added more cheese and seasoning on top.  Drizzled both with an extra tablespoon of olive oil and baked as directed.  OH MY GOODNESS..made the best bread I have ever tasted.  The plain loaf was not too sweet at all, had a beautiful golden brown crust and amazing texture.  The cheesy bread was the absolute best, golden brown crust as well with a swirl of cheese in the middle...will make great turkey, ham or roast beef sandwiches.  Highly recommended, definitely deserves more than 5 stars!!

Made for the first time today.  My husband gave it an 11 out of 10!!!  Amazingly wonderful!  I made it as written but am anxious to try it with whole wheat flour.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Delicious! I love this bread because you generally have all of the ingredients on hand.  I also substitute 2 cups of white flour for whole wheat flour.  I also add 4 tsp of wheat gluten which makes the loaves perfect!

A little too sweet for me, but still absolutely delicious! I used whole wheat flour and ground flax seed instead and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent bread recipe.  Followed the recipe to the letter when I made wheat bread and found that the loaf was tough with the 6 cups of flour.  I did not realize it until it was too late.  Made another batch of white bread and used only 5 1/2 cups of flour and it came out beautiful.  Great recipe though.

I have been trying to make the perfect bread for 10 yrs. My cupboard was bare and I was broke and needed something to do on a rainy day with limited ingredients, and I stumbled onto this.  Its just my husband and me so I halved the recipe. It came out better than ANYTHING that I had ever bought, been given. Now I am making it everyday, cause I will not by store bread ever again if I can help it. I don't know if its because of the new way I knead it, stretching instead of just rolling. but its the best. the Amish know their stuff

I was looking for a good, easy bread recipe to make with my 6 year-old.  Not only was it a perfect recipe for that, but this is one of the best white breads I've ever made.  Absolutley 5 stars as written--no adjustments needed.  My family loved it.  We'll be making this a lot.

I was up at 3am with nothing to do.  So i decided to bake the family some bread for breakfast.  This was so easy.  My loaf came out a little short, but the taste was wonderful.  I used the second part to make cinnamon buns.  I rolled it out.   Put pats of butter, nuts, brown sugar and cinnamon in it.  Rolled it up like a jelly roll then cut them.  I placed them in a 9x9 pan that had cinnamon and brown sugar and butter on the bottom.  I baked it for 30 min.  They came out wonderful.

I have found my bread recipe!!!  I live in a small town in Africa and it is impossible to find sliced white bread here.  I am so excited to find this recipe and the loaves turned out absolutely beautiful!  It slices nicely and you can get thicker slices than store-bought.

This was a great recipe. Based on others' comments, I used only 1/3 cup of sugar when proofing the yeast, and it came out pleasantly sweet, but not overpoweringly so. I also used AP flour & came out with a slightly denser bread, but had no problems - it just didn't rise as much pre- baked, but the loaves really puffed up when in the oven. I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner bread; it's much better as a breakfast bread with some butter or jam.

Very sweet, very easy.  I had no loaf pans and so made 2 dozen rolls, baked @ 350F for 20 minutes.

This bread is easy to make, the sugar doesn't add that much sweetness to the bread.  Overall everything just balance out.  Great bread recipe, will turn them into dinner rolls next time.

I don't buy light bread at the store anymore.  At first I thought this recipe was to simple to be really good, boy was I wrong.  Cut off a slice as soon as it comes out of the oven, slap on some butter and enjoy.

An excellent recipe, I used the half cup of sugar since most folks did use less. It made excellent toast as well. I am a very experienced bread baker (home) and this one is a keeper. I was really impressed with the number of people that actually are interested in making bread. From the reviews, I gather there are a lot.

This was a great bread but way to sweet.  Great for breakfast but not for any type of meat sandwich.  Next time I will cut down on the amount of sugar.

Very good recipe, my hubby loves it. i wish it was a tad less dense but i know why it is, i skip the last session of rising because i bake my bread on a pizza stone and not in a pan and it is less time that it is in the oven. come cold weather i might be less lazy.

I give it 4 because I would have liked some extra instructions that would be helpful to the first time bread baker, me! Other than that I think it was great! I couldn't wait to try it so I sliced off an end and put butter on it! VERY GOOD! I am eager to try again, maybe try the cinnamon bread. This is a keeper!

This is a great and simple recipe. I used half the sugar as other comments mention and it turned out as wonderful white bread, a tastier and healthier alternative to the store-bought Wonder bread.

LOVE this recipe!  I used the original as a breakfast breadfor french toast.  I made a second batch and only used 3 tbsp. of sugar and we are set for lunch bread for the week!  It is very easy to follow and is fantastically moist.  You'll never buy grocery store glue bread again!

Great recipes, I made a loaf of bread out of one, and a pan of cinn. rolls out of the other.  Going to make two pans of cinn rolls today for friends.  I too reduced the sugar per all the comments, but have decided for rolls it would be best for all the sugar.

This is a great recipe!  I adjusted the sugar by using 1/4 cup less as used by another reviewer.  Bread came out perfect!  This was the first loaf of bread I have made in a very long time.  I have been using a bread machine for over a year.  I thought I would do a rather simple bread and do it the traditional way since I have a lot of bread flour.

I made this bread for dinner...it was great! and very easy. I did use all purpose flour instead of bread flour, and added almost an whole cup extra. Other than that, I followed the  recipe and it worked exactly like they said it would..It took about an hour to rise and then a half hour in the loaf pans..I'll make it again!

I love making everything I can from scratch and went on a baking craze today. I took a previous reviewers suggestion and made one loaf and used the rest of the dough to make cinnamon rolls for breakfast tomorrow! I also used 1/2 cup of sugar because I was scared off by everyone saying the bread was too sweet and I'd say I'll try to full 2/3 cup next time, since I really didn't find it too sweet. AND on a side note, I've made many a white bread recipe and this one is by far the LEAST dense (we'll see how it holds up to sandwiches) but you definitely don't feel weighed down by eating a few slices! 
EDIT: I just through together a loaf of this, and although my house is cold and it didn't rise perfectly it still turned out delicious, on my third slice now.

This bread was ok. It was kind of bland. I suggest lowering the temperature and lowering the baking time. Mine was burnt on the top at just 20 min and most of it was cooked all the way, but the bottom was not. I will sub half the water for milk and up the sugar to about 1 and a half cups next time.

This was the first bread recipe I have attempted. It turned out beautifully! I found the directions easy to follow and helpful. I got rave reviews from my family and all the friends who enjoyed my Facebook status and photo updates of it! Thanks to the success I'm brave enough to venture into other bread recipes.

The quantities in this recipe worksperfectly with my dough hooks in my Phillips mixer, which is a bit less powerful than the basic Kitchenaid mixer.  I keep forgetting to reduce the amount of sugar because that much isn't needed but it always comes out great.  We let the dough go to the first rising and then use it for "dough slingers" or "toutons" as they are called in Newfoundland.  Tear strips of bread off the size of a golf ball and flatten them a bit.  Fry them in oil like a pancake. Slice the touton down the middle, butter and coat with molasses, jam or just plain sugar.  Not healthy, but makes a hearty breakfast, and a good accompaniment to bacon and eggs!

This is the best bread I have ever had.  I made this last week and both loaves were gone within 24 hours.  The bread is sweet, but I love it.  My whole family has been begging me to make it again!

I followed this exactly as written.  I made it to watch the season finale of the next Food Network Star.  It is wonderful.  I had one piece with homemade blackberry jam and another piece with a bit of cheese and it was suberb!

This is my go-to bread recipe.  I use half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  Sometimes I throw in a handful of oats, too.

This bread was really good, kind of sweet but still really good. I just need to figure out how to shape a loaf, other than that, perfect.

I made it as directed the first time, but now I sub in 2/3 c. oats for some of the flour, trade the sugar for honey (1/4 c.), and use butter instead of oil. It's pretty sweet as written, but I like my bread sweet.

This was my first time making bread without the bread machine. I've always been intimidated by bread because of all of the rising and kneading. But I have to say that this was very easy! And the bread is SO GOOD!!! Will definitely make again!

The bread was heavy and sweet, nothing like my mother's/aunt's/grandmother's homemade bread. It did taste good, but it's not something I'll try making again.

This is wonderful bread!  I did not change a thing.  I first made it for my husband and son and they just gobbled it up.  I then made it for a friend who loved it so much, she had me make it and put it in gift baskets that she was giving away.  She got nothing but rave reviews back!

DELICIOUS!  My husband is a Mennonite so his family always has fantastic baked goods, but he said this ranked right up there with them.  I follow the recipe just as written and haven't ever found it too sweet.  I've made it twice in 1 week -- it goes fast.  YUM!

This a great recipe!. I made it last Sunday and it was excelent. Delicious taste. Like Trisha I used olive oil and  I decresed the amont of sugar. It was not sweet enough but it was still great. I made it into rolls. One of my co-worker gave me 7 out 5. I will try next time adding more sugar and 1/4 of maple syrop or malt, then in the last minute of baking, I will butter the top of it to brown it, then add sugar on it. Simple DIVINE!

Pretty simple to make for a first-timer like me. I used olive oil instead of veggie oil since that's what I had on hand & it still tastes good. I'd use less sugar next time.

It was my first time making white bread. It looked pretty good and i was so excited.  I might have let it rise a little too long? maybe? I tasted yeast a little too much tho.  But still absolutely easy.  will try again.

I have only made bread a few times in my life, and most of them with a bread machine.  I wanted to try a simple white bread, and settled on this recipe.  I made it last night, kneading the dough by hand...I am blown away by how good this bread came out!  It has a slightly sweet flavor....as soon as it was cool enough to slice, I devoured a couple of pieces with butter.  This morning I made a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich with it.  This is great stuff.

The first time I tried to make bread, I used a recipe from a popular cookbook.  This recipe is much better.  The bread is a little sweet so next time I'd probably take a little sugar out.  I also let it rise for 50 minutes inside the bread pans instead of 30.  But it came out great!  I will make this again - it was good enough to stop us from buying bread at the store!

I've been looking for a bread recipe that would be easy to make, inexpensive, and something my family would enjoy.  This recipe is it.  It was gone in a matter of days, we do not normally eat a lot of bread.  It is delicious and very, very easy to cut the recipe in half.  No more buying bread!!

i make this bread several times a week and it is great!  in saying that, it also is unpredictable.  one time i will make it and the dough seems too dry, next time it is sticky and tacky!  the time it takes to rise (the first time) is usually for me between and hour and an hour and a half and the second time (after punching down and transferring to pans) no less than an hour.  i keep my home fairly cool in the summer.  regardless of the dryness or how sticky or tacky the dough is, when baked, it comes out perfectly.  do NOT be discouraged if your dough doesn't seem exactly right.  this dough is nearly fool proof.  : )

This a very good bread. It has a nice soft texture and a rather plain flavor which makes it good to use for sandwiches. However, I found that 350 made my bread very well done on the outside after about 18 minutes and the inside wasn't all the way done. I think a lower temp for a longer time would be better. Good recipe though and I'll certainly try it again because the parts that were cooked were delightful.

I join the ranks of all those who've rated this with 5+ stars! My very first attempt making bread dough. It's been raining pretty much non-stop where I live for last 5+ weeks, so good way to spend another rainy Sunday. Couldn't believe how perfectly they came out - was so proud of myself! I made sure to read many posts first, so I cut the sugar amount in half. Altho I like sweet breads, any more would've been too much. I also made mine in 8.5" x 4.5" pans so they did rise a bit too high. Next time I'll use 1 cup less flour, even if using 9x5 pan - nightmare trying to stir that last cup in & doesn't seem necessary. This is an amazing bread; my husband crazy about it & both loaves were gone in 3 days, w/just the 2 of us!  It's easy AND delicious, & like so many others wrote, I will never buy store bread again!!

This is a great bread!  It's slightly sweet and has a nice density to it. Another plus it that it doesn't take all day to make.

This bread is simple and delicious with just the right amount of "sweet"! It's best when served warm. I let it cool on a rack for about 20 minutes before serving. All this needs is a little butter, and yum...I could eat the whole loaf by myself! This was also a huge hit with my 2 year old daughter.

This bread is so delicious! My first batch came out perfect, and my husband and I gobbled it up in two days! I made more while my husband's family was up and they at it all, grabbing it a slice at a time until both loaves were gone. My 3 year old nephew keeps asking if he can have some more bread! I made one batch with reduced sugar to make hamburger buns, but they came out a bit heavy.

This was GREAT, so good in fact that I registered after years of using this site just so I could review it! So simple and straight forward.  Nice to find a recipe that wasn't written for a bread machine.  A little on the sweet side, that's the only reason this wasn't a 5 star bread for me.  I halved the recipe because I have only one loaf pan - will be making another tonight!

Very yummy...I have made it now several times. I can't decide if it is too sweet or not...great toast bread, a little too dense for sandwiches.  I have lightened up on the sugar which actually makes the bread a little fluffier and better for sandwiches so I guess it just depends on what you want it for.

I made this bread for the first time last August and since then have probably made it an additional 40 times. My family LOVES this bread and will no longer eat the store bought - they are completely SPOILED! It's really very simple to make,  my 10 year old and I have started braiding the dough (like a challah) for the final rise. It comes out SOOO beautiful, and fluffy - makes a great gift.

This was just okay...I followed the recipe as is and it came out very heavy and too sweet.  I'll try making it again as this was my first attempt with bread.  I'll probably cut back on the amount of sugar as suggested by other reviews.

I've tried to make bread to many times to count and failed until this bread. Everyone in our home gave it a thumbs up. I finally did it!!! I just followed the directions, so simple. Next time I will put less sugar. Fantastic bread!

Bread is light and airy. OK, if you want a simple white bread. It's best eaten immediately because the bread dries out quickly.

if you are looking for a moist, slightly sweet loaf of bread, then this is the recipe for you. it is a very easy to make. my 9 year old daugter made this with no problem. i served i to my family and they loved it. 5 people ate one loaf of bread in about three minutes. i recommend eating this with butter and honey. after it comes out of the oven, wait for it to cool before cutting it or it will crumble. use the suggestions from "breadguy" review. overall, this is my favorite bread ever.

This was quite good.  My husband LOVED it... One loaf never even made it to the fridge :-)  I used Splenda instead of sugar to cut down on the calories and it worked very well.  This is a delicious recipe and is definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe is awesome. And addictive. I cut the recipe in half since there's just two of us. Based on some of the reviews, I also cut the sugar back to 3 tablespoons. I made the dough in the bread machine and then baked it in the oven. The texture is perfect, rises beautifully, and smells amazing. This is my new favorite bread.

This is the first bread I have ever made. My only alteration was to cut down on the sugar due to my personal preference. AMAZING! It came out perfect, and I was the rock star at my family's Easter meal for bringing this bread to the table. I made it with my Kitchen-Aid stand mixer and oven instead of a bread machine, and it was sooooo easy. I no longer feel intimidated by bread recipes! I know I'll be making this bread for the rest of my life! Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good. Still trying to figure out the yeast and rising - several times the yeast fails to proof (despite being new from store and not expired). Tried hotter water (115F) - seemed to work better.

My husband thought this was great, but personally I thought it was a bit dense, and the dough was tough to work with. This might be down to my kneading skills tho! It was tasty though.

This is the first time I have ever attempted to make bread form scratch and I am very pleased with the results. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and would still decrease it more as it is plenty sweet. I used the advice of others and used my mix-master with the dough hook and slowly added the flour and didn't increase the speed to more than 2. I also made a small 4cm diameter round pan of mini cinnamon buns. The whole recipe turned out great. Will make again. Thanx for sharing. Update: I tryed this again but decreased the sugar to 1/8 cup and also used 4 cups white flour and two cups whole wheat..turned out great. I don't recommend using the dough that way for cinnamon buns as it was tougher to roll out and when I cooked them the middle of each bun popped up. Looked pretty but not what I wanted

I didn't cook this long enough and only the top was properly cooked. I used the egg wash and they looked pretty, but next time I would bake for longer but that's just in my oven.

this recipe is awesome I have used it several times and it has came out great every time. My suggestion is to use a little less sugar and possibly and egg for texture.

Absolutely perfect!  I halved the dough and made a loaf with one part and made hamburger buns with the other.  My family insisted on more of this bread!

I am not a big fan of white bread, but my husband loves it so I made this recipe for him.  Turned out to be one of the best recipes I have ever used.  The loaf was so soft and sweet.  PERFECT!  I made the second loaf into cinnamon swirl bread that I ate as toast with my breakfast.  YUMMY!

This is the best and easiest bread recipe I have ever made.  My family loves the sweetness of the bread.  I always make a loaf for my granddaughter's birthday as she would rather eat the bread than cake!

Very good bread recipe...bread flour is the key to great bread.  I found the flavor of this bread a bit flat.  I would definitely increase the salt to 2 tsp.  I had decreased the sugar to a 1/2 cup and my family thought it was a bit too sweet.

This is the first of many times I will make this recipe, it's so easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe except to cut sugar to 1/4 cup.  I did an egg white wash on the tops before putting in the oven.  I think I'll be making this on weekends to have enough bread for the week.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I devoured this yummy bread! We only had all-purpose flour, but the bread turned out just fine. Perhaps next time I might use slightly less sugar, but it is guranteed I will be making this bread often.

This bread is awesome!!! The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it was really hard to knead. I started with my KA but it was just too tough for the mixer, so I had to finish it by hand. It's a really tough dough. But, it turned out amazingly well! We ate a loaf and a half last night! I can't wait to make this bread again and again!!!

Loved this recipe. The first loaf didnt last 30 min. out of the oven. I have to make bread at least twice a week because it gets eatin so fast. Thank you for the recipe. I do have to cook this bread about an extra 5 - 10 min.

I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup like others and it was perfection!  My first time making bread and it was a total success.  I used half the dough to make clone of cinnabon recipe and those were great as well!

Okay, I just made this bread and it is amazing!  I am very new to bread making and this recipe is fool-proof!!  I put everything in my bread maker on dough mode and then did the rest as the recipe states.  I did not decrease my sugar because I wanted a sweeter bread. Next time, I will decrease the sugar as others have suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!!  Good luck--happy bread making!

I have made this recipe 3 times since I found it last week and everyone loves it.  I've made it exactly according to the recipe, and I've also made it substituting white whole wheat flour for half of the amount of flour called for.  I've also baked it in loaf pans as called for in the recipe, but also on a baking sheet in a rustic oval.  Again, perfect bread everytime.

My first time making bread and I loved this recipe. It was easy and fun! I used a bit less sugar (about 1/3) like most people suggested. I made one regular loaf and one cinnamon swirl. Both were delicious!!

This was my first attempt at making bread. It is GREAT. I am making more right now! It only took 5 cups of flour though. It probably has something to do with the extreme dryness where I live. I didn't find this bread the least bit dense.

I prepared this today with no variations from the recipe except to make one of the loaves free-form on a pizza pan. The bread turned out as a pleasantly sweet loaf which was quite soft and moist with a moderately dense texture and a thin crust. So far, I am finding it is very easy to tuck away with just a bit of margerine and seems like a good breakfast bread. Great recipe!

This is a good white bread and I'm speaking from a constant bread eating family. But I've baked a few with different recipes but still tasted the same.  Most chinese bakeries have better tasting bread.

This bread was awesome. We loved the taste. I have never made loaf bread before and I have tried this recipe once. It came out a little dense-but I attribute that to the fact that it was my first time. I plan to keep trying till the texture is as perfect as the taste. I did do as other reviewers mentioned and used only 1/3 cup sugar. Came out perfectly sweet. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm so excited this worked!  My first try at homemade bread, and I had a few glitches:  my yeast was a little old, according to the pkg. date, I didn't have bread flour and then I ran out of all purpose flour!  I wound up mixing whole wheat with all-purpose with a little cake flour, and it STILL worked!  It never did rise an inch over the rims of the baking pans, but I have high hopes for the next time when I'll have all the right stuff...

I enjoyed the process of making this bread. It came out amazingly good. I don't have a bread machine and glad that it is still do-able by hand. I couldn't find bread flour from my local grocery store, so I used all-purpose flour. All-purpose flour makes my bread less chewy and more alike a "biscuit bread". But it is still very good. I think proofing the yeast is the key to this recipe. I don't have anything to measure the temperature of my water so here's what I did - 1. Put cold water into microweave on high for 1 min. - 1 min. and 20 sec. 2. Put sugar (I used 1/4 cup) into the warm water, if it dissolve easily with a few stir, the water is good. Make sure the water is warm, not hot. 3. Put the yeast into the sugar water, stir a few times to make sure the yeast is sub-merge into the water. And WAIT for about 10-13 minutes. You should then see a layer of bubbles. In my case, the layer of bubble was thin, and the yeast reacted to the water slowly. Check the expiration date of your yeast BEFORE use. If your yeast is too old, it will not work. This recipe is simple, but it requires patience. So wait a bit longer for your dough to rise. All in all, this is a keeper. I just had a nice thick slice of the bread for breakfast this morning. I toast the slice and spread my favorite raspberry preserve all over.....oh heaven!

Fabulous!  I did it in my kitchen aid and it turned out perfect.  Very sweet though - it would be great dough for cinnamon buns.  I did it 50% whole wheat just because all my flour is always premixed.

Nice and dense like bread from the store. Works great for sandwiches. Coat the top with milk for a softer crust.

So easy, and wonderful!!! First time bread maker and it turned out perfectly.  I read most of the reviews, and knew that this would be a dense sweet bread like Hawaiian bread - and loved it.  Makes such great toast!  Hard to keep around longer than a day!

perfect as bread or dinner rolls!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely perfect! Stands up to adding a tablespoon of butter or so into the mix. (I mix the dough in the bread machine, rise it a second time and bake in the oven)

Very good bread for sandwiches or toast.  Would have given it 5 stars but I personally think it is a bit too sweet.  The second time I made this I cut the sugar down to a rounded 1/3 cup.  Much more to my taste!  Thanks for sharing this recipe

I LOVE this recipe!! Couoldn't be easier! I've been making this recipe for several months now after not having made bread since helping grandma when I was 8. I was looking for something to do w/ all the flour I had sitting in my cupboard from cleaning out my father-in-law's place, wanted to make bread but didn't have any eggs. And I'm lazy :) One thing I did though is actually double the yeast and increase the sugar to about a full cup. I don't find it too sweet at all and everyone who's tried it so far loves it. And by increasing the yeast, I get a good rise both times and can get 3 loaves out of the same amount of flour. I would really like to try hand kneading it but my counter space doesn't allow for it. The electric mixer my Dad got me for Christmas after trying my first attempt works wonders!!

My kids love this bread. I don't add as much sugar as called, it's just not needed and tastes just as fabulous! Thanks for a great recipe. I have been making three loaves a week for the last couple months! Great for sandwiches too!

I had never made bread before but after trying this recipe, I make bread all the time! Great recipe, easy even for a beginner like me. I sometimes only use 1/3 cup sugar if I don't want the bread as sweet as normal, although it is delicious either way.

Excellent excellent bread recipe.  Finally, a recipe that didn't become a lump of lead in the oven.  Even when I wasn't careful and baked it on a higher rack, this bread was very forgiving. I removed it from the pans, put it back in the oven on a lower rack for 5-7 minutes, and the bottom browned beautifully.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!!!

My first try at making bread. I didn't care for it too much. I took the advice of some of the commentors here and reduced the sugar a little, and I think that was a mistake b/c the bread was too sour. It still tasted ok, but would've been better w/ the full amount of sugar.

This bread is amazing. I do find that the original recipe's sugar measurement is a little too sweet for our everyday use, so I cut the sugar down to 1/8c, and I use wheat flour instead of white.  My fussy 4-year-old just LOVES this bread!!!

At last, a recipe that truly works.  My bread rised, it's the texture I've been wanting.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Like what the other reviewers suggested, I set aside the other half of the dough and made cinnamon dessert.  I can't wait for the kids to come home and taste it.  I mixed brown sugar, cinnamon, butter & cream cheese as filling and topper.

This bread was very good.  I cut back on the sugar as other reviewers had suggested but next time will use the suggested amount.  My bread didn't rise as much as it should have once in the bread pans (even waited far longer than time suggested) and was a bit dense for my liking but still tasty.

The BEST bread I have ever had! I had never made bread before and TRIED to use my Joy cookbook, but after three tries gave up and came here. I later found out that the recipe in Joy is wrong and a correction was later put out.... not sure it matters though. This will be the only white bread I ever make! It was so simple and came out picture perfect and delicious!! Thank you so much!

Excellent recipe!!  Thanks for sharing!  I actually used a bread machine to make the dough and it worked beautifully. I just followed basic bread machine order (liquid, flavoring agents, and fat on bottom, flour on top w/ yeast in the center of the flour "volcano") and it came out great, before baking i brushed with a little melted honey butter (I know everyone says its a bit sweet, but I am making it for breakfast). This is definitely a keeper because you don't need to run to the store for a bunch of ingredients!

We love this recipe.  I have a son with food allergies, so we make this often.  He loves it!  We have even made it into buns using a 9x13 pan and rolling the dough into small balls.

i just made this bread tonight and it was so good, and so easy! i followed the suggestions of some others and cut the sugar down. i also kneaded it in the kitchen aid and it made it so fast. i have never ever made bread before and so i was hesitant, but it came out great. i am planning to try it again and cut back further on the sugar and add some honey as well as some wheat flour. i would love to know if anyone has tried any other flours for this as well.

This was my first attempt at "real" bread making -- followed recipe exactly and this was the best bread ever!  My family ate it all before it had a chance to get cold.  Good-bye bread machine!

I loved how SOFT this bread is.  I have tired of the bread machine bread so I started experimenting on some that requires more effort.  This was a wonderful find!  I didn't change a thing, unlike some of the other reviewers.  I'm going to end up gaining back all the weight I just lost if I make this too often!

First-time baking bread and it turned out great! Like others, I used only 1/4 cup sugar. Just a note of caution to new bread bakers like me: I was scared when it first came out of the oven because it smelled and tasted too yeasty. I though I ruined it. Baking it at night, I let it cool, wrapped it, and then went to it the next morning, hoping for better results. Everything was fine. The yeasty smell and taste were gone. Thanks so much for this great recipe. I'll be sure to bake a lot more of it in the future, God willing.

Really great flavor and texture. I used my Bosch mixer instead of mixing & kneading by hand. I also substituted a 1/2 cup honey for the sugar because of a sugar allergy. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I love this bread. In this economy I make 2 loaves every weekend and slice it up for lunches for the family. Wonderful. It takes me less than 10 minutes to put it together. After letting it rise and punching it down for a second rise I get it in the oven and it is amazing. The only substitution I have done is to use bread flour instead of all purpose. The bread stays moist and tender for the whole week.

This was the best and easiest bread I have ever made.  I did cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup with about 2-3 tbsp of honey, my son loves it.  I also used unbleach AP flour instead of bread flour.  I have only made a few loaves of bread and am really just getting started, but this will be the one we stick with.  It was easy and delicious.

I made this bread in my machine I had to readust measurements to make a smaller loaf other than that the bread was great.  My family and I enjoyed the bread very much.  There is nothing better than the smell of fresh bread baking.  I will be making another loaf today.

Happy eating

Next time, I'll follow the other reviewer's advice and drastically cut the sugar-this was WAY too sweet to be just white bread.  Also, it turned out kind of heavy-but that could have been my error-I'm just not the best at making bread----yet!

This recipe has earned a permanent place in my cookbook!

Wow! This is a winner in my house, I made exactly how stated (my husband has a sweet tooth)and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe and with another caramel sauce from this site it made the sweetest carmel rolls. One bread loaf was gone before it even had a chance to cool off. I of course split them because making four smaller loafs and 12 large rolls 3 of the smaller loaves I kneeded real well they rose in the oven real nice and were lighter than the other loaf I didn't kneed as much, it turned out more heavy. Don't know if that makes a huge difference (I'm not a baker)but it seemed to. Thank you for this recipe, from my five kids and myself we will be using this one from here on out!

This recipe is awesome. I only use one packet of yeast (2 1/2 teaspoons) and it rises nice and high. I cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup for personal preference. I have also made half white, half wheat and it turns out great. Makes yummy cinnamon swirl bread too!

Really tasty! Really easy! Before finding this recipe I had never made bread without a bread machine, I was always a bit intimidated by it but this recipe had great reviews and sounded easy enough so I gave it a whirl and like another member said, this recipe is foolproof, it turned out wonderfully! I actually prefer to make rolls with the dough,because I'm not a fan of to loaf bread being so sweet, if I do make loaves, I cut the sugar in half. ENJOY!!!

I had never made homemade bread before, saw this recipe and thought I'd try it.  I thought it didn't rise enough after punching down but I put it in the oven and it rose beautifully and it was delicious.  I don't think you can mess this up.  Thanks for all the helpful hints from the reveiws at making homemade bread, I'll be using this recipe forever!

This was an amazingly forgiving and successful surprise.  I NEVER rate a recipe, but this is TOO GOOD to not comment.  It was a crazy day and I decided to try a new bread recipe (this one).  It was very easy to pull together, kneaded like a dream, and did the first rise like clockwork.  That's when the day went crazy.  I had a dishwasher installer show up an hour early and stay for 3 1/2 hours just at the moment I was going to punch down the dough, knead a second time and form my loaves.  So, by the time I actually got to this, I was a full 2 1/2 hours late.  I did it anyway.  I let it rise in the pans for about 45 minutes - didn't rise that high, but I thought Ok, lets bake them off and I can use them for Thanks Giving stuffing.  THEY CAME OUT PERFECTLY RISEN, LIGHT AND FLUFFY, PICTURE PERFECT CRUST, AND DELICIOUS.  I can't wait to make them again..

This bread is delicious! Like another user, I used my KitchenAid and dough hook. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. I was sure to use BREAD flour as another user mentioned too.  DELICIOUS, and easy, only had to handle it after the first rise.

Like many others have said, it's simple and good.  I cut the sugar to a half cup and liked the results very much.  It's a keeper!

The recipe amount of sugar turns out more like a Hawaiian Bread. Reduce to 1/4 cup for a more traditional white bread. Stays soft and fresh well.

This makes 16 rolls for me.

Best bread ever! did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I've made this about 6 times in the last couple weeks, it great for cinnamon rolls, cinnamon raisen bread, monkey bread, regular white bread and i threw three dough balls each into a cupcake pan and they made great dinner  rolls.

I thought this was okay -- but I guess I think my bread machine often ends up with relatively dry bread -- I'm not sure if it is overbaking it by just a few minutes or what the issue is.

My husband is a big Wonder bread kind on man, never seemed to care too much for homemade, too dense for him. He likes this very much though, says its the best I've ever made. Cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup though, as 2/3 is just way too much. Rose very high and is nice and fluffy!

Wow!! This recipe is fantastic!!! I may never buy white bread again! I hosted a tea party and wanted to make pink bread for some of my cucumber tea sandwiches. I just tinted the water a deep pink and then microwaved the water (shhh, don't tell the Amish!) to get it back up to temperature before adding the the yeast at *just* the right time. It was so easy to make and the end result was impressive. I have made it again and again(without dye) and it is our favorite!!

This is a wonderful bread.  I made it with my Kitchen Aid mixer and it turned out much better then anything that you make in the bread machine.  I find that a bread machine mixes for far to long and makes the dough tough resulting in a heavy bread.  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet.  If you let this bread rise the second time for the full amount of time stated, you may find the bread overflowing from the pan BUT the result is a very fluffy white bread.  Perfect :)

Amazingly easy bread to make.  I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and bread had the perfect hint of sweetness.  We made open faced turkey sandwiches and the bread held the gravy without getting soggy.

This was excellent!  I reduced the sugar to  1/4 cup as others have done.  It came out perfect.  It was very flavorful and had a nice hearty texture.  I'll be using this recipe often.

A little too sweet the first time around but I reduced the sugar and it was much more to our liking. Otherwise it would be a five star recipe.

This was my first try at making bread and i was more than a little nervous. I am happy to report that it turned out great! I followed the recipe to a T and it smelled so good while baking and tasted even better. I also made anadama bread from this site and both were great. Can't really pick one that i enjoy more as they are completely different. I plan on making a lot more bread in the future and will definately make this one again

A really great recipe. I used instant yeast since it was all I had so I skipped the proofing stage and mixed all the dry ingredients together and then added the warm water and oil. Had no loaf pans so made dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls which came out really terrific.  It's to simple not to repeat often. This website is making cooking more a hobby than a chore.  Thanks allrecipes.

My first time making a white bread, and it was AMAZING.  Such an awsome recipe!  Just follow the directions, and you'll end up with a soft, sweet white bread.  The one thing is that like others have said, I think that you could put a little less sugar.  But it was still great!  I made it into four mini loaves, and they were delicious, even with just a little butter.

I gave this 4 stars because it tasted pretty good but was not the yummiest bread I've ever had - but for the confidence boost as my 3 year old downed four slices in a row - 10 stars! I reduced the sugar to a 1/3, otherwise, followed the recipe. Thanks!

Super easy to make.  I kneeded it in a large stir clad bowl instead of on a floured surface.  Came out doughy purposely.  Reminds me of Hawaiian sweet/ pineapple bread.

First time to try this recipe.  Just like most everyone else, I think it turned out wonderful.  I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup as recomended by other raters.  I will be cooking for 12 men for a week in Mexico soon.  I plan on cooking this bread daily.  Thank you for adding to the menu for the trip.

I'm new to making bread so the easier the recipe the better for me. This was very easy to fallow but for me, I've tried three times, I can't get it to rise over the pan in 30 minutes. So other than that, this makes some great bread that I can't keep in the house more then a day.

By far, the best bread we have ever made. I've made bread for years and never could find a recipe that worked the way I wanted it to. It's wonderful as is. We also made it with some added caraway seed and that was fantastic too. I don't feel it's to sweet at all, and will continue to use the suggested amount of sugar... Five stars from our family, we love it. Thanks for sharing.

Incredibly good and not overwhelming to make.  With only two loaves the kneading and mixing is no problem at all.  My kids loved it for school lunches.

This is an easy homemade recipe for bread. All our friends and family love this bread and always wants me to make lots of it so they can have a loaf. Works great for sandwhiches or to serve with a meal. I use this recipe at least twice a week and make about six loaves each time. Annie

AWESOME bread! This was so easy. I've had so much trouble with making bread in the past (and most of my cooking endeavors lately!) I was a little nervous to make this. But it turned out great! I will be making this quite often. I reduced the sugar down to about 1/4 of a cup and I think that was about right. I made one loaf of bread and with the left over dough I made cinnamon rolls which were to die for. This bread recipe is incredible!!!

This is the absolute BEST bread recipe!!! I have baked bread for a long time and could never get it to come out like my grandmas (whom makes the worlds best bread;) and this recipe was right on the money. Its soooo incredibly easy too, I have gone to baking bread a couple times a year to a couple times a week!!! I only use 1/3 cup of sugar for loaves of bread but when I use this to make cinnamon rolls and other sweet rolls I use 2/3 cup of sugar. The recipe is very easy to follow and mistakes are easily fixed. It is a recipe anybody can make and fall in love with:)

For some reason I had to cook this A LOT longer and it was still a little doughy in the center.  It's probably just my oven or something.  The bread that I salvaged, which was most of it, was delicious!  Slightly sweet and Very moist.  Great recipe!

I am so excited that I finally made bread that turned out!!  I mixed it in my kitchenaid mixer using the instructions from breadguy.  I too reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used all purpose flour. I didn't use the full 6 cups (probably 5 to 5 1/2).  Awesome bread!!!!

Excellent bread - soft, great taste, easy to make. I plan on making this again and again.

I prefer a less sweet bread, so I added only a half cup of sugar, and it was perfect.

I made this bread last night and it is wonderful. I only used 1/3 cup of sugar and the "second" raise took about an hour. I am going to add raisins and cinnamon next time I make it!!

Very good, but very sticky.  I made the dough in the bread maker, then took it out (with difficultly) to bake in the oven.  It also didn't come out of the pan, despite being well oiled.  But I will make it again.

WOW!  What a fantastic recipe!  We read the reviews first and opted for only half the sugar and it came out FANTASTIC!  The smell of fresh baked bread brought Grandma back to her childhood.  We are actually going to use it to make sandwiches for our lunches.  For first timers, it came out like a pro did it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, we will definitely make it again!

Easy and DELICIOUS!

I've never made bread before and this turned out perfect. Very lightly sweet, not too sweet at all. Soft and fluffy in the middle, crispy on the outside.

I'll double the recipe next time!

Love this bread recipe! I made one loaf, and cinnamon rolls. YUMM!!! This bread reminds me alot of Bob Evan's rolls. I may try this into dinner rolls next time. I took a previous reviewer's advice and reduced the amount of sugar to a heaping 1/3 cup. I think they came out PERFECT!! Thanks for my new favorite bread recipe!

Fantastic bread. The type where just one slice or bite wouldn't be enough. Reduced the sugar by half and substituted for brown sugar since I didn't have white sugar on hand. The result turned out to be a lovely fragrant loaf of white bread with just a mild sweet taste characteristic of some kinds of white bread. Overall, a very nice tasty recipe for white bread :)

My twelve-year-old daughter made this recipe (with a little help from Mom) and it turned out beautifully! It was delicious and had such a lovely flavor. If you are looking for a simple fool-proof bread recipe, you found it.

I was impressed at how easy this recipe was to make. To warn other people first trying this recipe the dough will be very sticky. I was almost worried that I had forgotten a cup of flour.

This bread was a little too sweet for me. I may try if again and half the sugar or I may move on to find another kind of bread.

This is the best bread I have ever had! As I was looking for sandwich bread, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested by other reviewers. The result was two beautiful loaves of bread so delicious that I have gotten up in the middle of the night specifically to sneak a piece (or three!) I've been baking bread for a few years and this is by far the most delicious (and easy!) yeast bread I have come across.

Other than Foccacia bread, this is the first bread I have ever made.  I did it by hand and thought that it was not going to turn out because I thought it was very sticky. I kept with it though and baked it. Glad I did. The first loaf didn't last an hour after my husband and step-son came home. That is how I know it was good. I didn't think I could make bread, this makes me think that I can make anything.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I know I will be making this again.

Excellent bread.  Nice and soft and very sweet.  I substituted honey for the white sugar and will probably use only 1/3 cup next time.

This bread is so simple and absolutely fabulous! I had never made any bread before this and it came out perfect! I didn't change a thing, but did take someone eles's advice by putting an egg white splash over the top just purely for the look! My boyfriend loves this bread, its great when toasted too because it stays crunchy and doesn't get soggy!

This recipe has made my shopping budget so much better! I can whip up two loaves of bread in no time rather than paying $6 in the store. Using a dough hook, whether on a kitchen aid mixer or a hand-held, has made all the difference for me. My husband says, "MMM! Wow!" any time he takes the first bite of bread, whether as a sandwich or fresh out of the oven. We love it! :)

This was a great recipe.  Even for me who this is the very first time I've baked bread.  I followed the directions to the "t" and opted not to reduce the sugar as many other did.
I came out with a very sweet, bread, something that is perfect for breakfast or for making rolls.  It was very simple to make and delicious to eat. 
Thanks!

GREAT! After it cools it slices so beautiful. I use this as a daily bread in our home for sandwiches or warn with butter for dinners! I let it rise 2 times and punched down, then seperated into loaves and let it rise for baking. add a touch of honey for a little extra flavor although this recipe needs no help! Use an unbleached flour to keep it natural, unbleached is far better than bleached anyway!

This bread was incredibly easy and satisfying to make. As soon as I was done I brought some over to my best friend's house. I gave him a warm loaf of bread, now who doesn't love that and we ate it. I was so satisfied with the way this turned out that I am considering always baking my bread from now on!

This recipe is so simple that my 13 y/o daughter made it tonight without one hitch. My husband devoured a fourth of one loaf (before I could catch him) and she asked for another slice before bed! So yes, the recipe is quick and simple, although I will be cutting back on the sugar the next time we make it.

My daughters and I made this recipe yesterday. This was our first ever attempt at making bread. I must say, the recipe and user comments were SO helpful! I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and we were all amazed by how beautiful the bread turned out. It could have been a picture in a magazine! As of french toast this morning, both loaves are gone. Thank you guys for making this a great experience for my family!!

So good, I made this bread twice in the last 24 hours!  The first time, I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour.  My first time baking bread from scratch.  I worried about everything - did I let the yeast proof long enough, did I knead it long enough, did I let it rise enough....but it came out very good.  Today, I made it with regular white bread flour.  One of my loaf pans is slightly bigger than the other, and I wanted some big slices for sandwiches, so I split the dough about 2/3 and 1/3.  But, there was no need to - both loaves rose much better with the white flour.  Much tastier, too! Reduced sugar to 1/3 cup for both batches.

This was the first bread recipe I ever made, and it came out perfect. It's a good thing it makes two loaves; the first one is eaten right out of the oven! And the second one is gone the next day. It is sweet and tender and we all love it!

i made this recipe for the first time and it came out perfect. 
i made sure the yeast and sugar were kept at least 105 degrees warm, and while letting it sit kept it on the oven stove (with the oven on occasionally, and oven door open) so that it would stay warm and rise accordingly. 
thanks for sharing!!

Followed the Bread Mans advice and the 1st loaf was gone in one sitting as my young children begged for more.  I kept the sugar at 2/3 C.

I am always on the lookout for good breads that don't require a bread machine as I don't have one. This is an easy and delicious bread. My husband and I have big sweettooths so we left in the full amount of sugar. Yummy!

Really yummy. I'd take the advice to reduce the sugar so it's more like regular bread. I gently divided the loaf into rolls before the second rise, and put the rolls in a round cake pan so people could tear off pieces. Next time, i'll incorporate other ingredients like cheese and ham and herbs.

Delicious bread, cuts exceptionally well with a regular kitchen knife. This one's definitely a keeper. I had to let it rise a lot longer than the directions said.

I have never successfully made bread and this was my first try at this recipe and it was HUGELY successful.  The bread is beautiful, my house smells lovely, and the bread tastes Fabulous!!  I only used 3 TBS sugar and think it is perfect-o.

Really good white bread recipe. Flavor and texture are really satisfying. I used only 1/3 cup sugar and it is an outstanding bread for sandwiches, toast or just snacking.

This is a good recipe that is very easy to folow I would decrease the sugar quite a bit or just add a little honey instead.

Though my yeast didn't proof the way it should have (my fault-- the water wasn't quite hot enough!), this bread still came out wonderful!  My new favourite bread recipe! I didn't use quite the ammount of sugar called for, but didn't skimp out too much because I wanted it to be sweeter than my bread normally is (cooking hawaiian tonight, too).  Mine came out light and fluffy-- not overly dense.  Will be using this recipe a LOT (though I'll probably use less sugar in other batches, but tonight wanted the extra sweetness).

This is my new favorite white bread recipe.  I halved the recipe and used a little less than half the sugar and got super results.  Next time I make cinnamon rolls I'll use all the sugar it calls for.  Thanks so much for this!

I make two loaves every Saturday. I use the whole amount of sugar and at other times I cut it by half and it still is great. I use my kitchen Aide mixer to make this bread. The bread freezes very well. I give away the extra loaf often and everyone loves it.

Even though I took the advice of others and reduced the sugar (to 1/4 cup), the bread still turned out too sweet. Tastes like Kings Hawaiian bread even with a lot less sugar than originally called for.  Can't imagine what it would taste like w/ 2/3 cup...cake?

Excellent.  I halved the recipe and made the dough in the bread machine, then let it rise in the loaf pan for 30 minutes as directed and baked.  Also, since I was looking for a sandwich bread, I halved the sugar based on other reviews.

I made this recipe for the first time today and it came out perfectly.  I did cut the amount of sugar in half as I prefer my bread less sweet.  I'm going to try adding fresh herbs and cheese and other flavorings in the future.  This is a keeper!!!

This was the first time I really made bread, and it turned out so perfect and it was so easy. The only thing I did differently was I cut the sugar down to 1/4 a cup. And I used my kitchenaid mixer. I will definately be making this often!

I am new to bread baking and found this recipe easy and versatile. It makes a great cinnamon and raisin bread loaf too.
After dividing the dough, I shape one into a loaf for plain white bread and the other I roll out and put golden raisins w/cinnamon and brown sugar on it. Then I roll it up, seal the edges and bake the same as the white loaf. Great Recipe.

Great bread recipe, use it all the time.  I reduce the sugar though.  I usually double the recipe and use 3/4 to 1 cup sugar instead (when I DOUBLE the recipe).  makes great sandwich bread.

I found this recipe to be one of the BEST recipes for bread that I have tried in a long time.  I did not have bread flour on hand but regular flour worked great.  I did add a gluten enhancer and it was excellent.

I'm a total bread novice, but I made this bread today with minimal effort.  I followed the recipe as is with the exception of the flour, I used a half white/half wheat flour.  I made the adaptations for mixing in my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook and over all it was fairly simple once I researched exactly what letting the yeast perk was.  The bread came out very good and tasty and my entire family thinks it tastes like the bread they bring to the table at Longhorns Steak House.  We love it.  For sandwiches I do think that next time I will cut the sugar in half.  It's not bad as is, just sweeter than I typically like my sandwich bread.

We'll definitely make it again.

This was easy-I made them into cinnamon rolls, but next time I think I will half the dough before rolling it out. But the end result was wonderful! I used syrup, heated in the microwave, added some vanilla, brown sugar & southern comfort and put that in the bottom of a glass baking dish & set aside. As for filling, I used brown & white sugar, nutmeg, grd cloves and melted butter. I had to let it rise for about 40min. and baked it at 350 for about 1hr. (it stayed raw in the middle-due to the excessive dough in an inadiquite dish) then i turned it out on a foil lined cookie sheet and spooned the "goo" on the upside. It reheated very well the next morn!!! next time when i make this, I am going to make two seperate dished for the rolls. Love it,Love it!!

This bread was ok and probably would have been great if I knew how to work with yeast more.  I thought the yeast was ready because of it's foamy appearance and I didn't think my water was too hot, but I let the dough rise for 1.45 hours and it didn't double.  I put it all into one bread tin and let it rise for another 1/2 hour and this made a huge loaf.  I only used 1/4 cup sugar like other reviewers suggested but I think I will add more next time.  I'll make it again and hopefully give it a better rating next time.

The first time we made this is came out a little on the heavy side (like a sweet bread).  It was wonderful, but not the taste I was looking for....

The next time we cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons and did it in my Kitchenaid with the dough hook (like the breadman review stated) and it came out wonderful!...Definitely the one we love the most!

I brushed butter on the tops (with a pastry brush) after they came out of the oven.

YUM! YUM!
Try it...You won't be disappointed!

This is such an easy recipe and it is so tasty! I will never be buying bread again. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 C sugar in stead of the full amount if calls for. I will definantly make this again!

I wish I could give it more stars.  So easy,especially for some who is yeast challenged.   I mixed it in my Kitchen-Aid.  Perfect for toast or PB&J.  I may stop buying bread at the store.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My first successful attempt at bread!  Followed other reviewers and lowered the sugar to a few tablespoons.  Really lovely - also made rolls from it.  Even sliced it the next day and toasted for sandwiches.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used this dough to make pepperoni rolls (ok those from WV may not know what they are but it's just pepperoni wrapped in bread dough and baked) and they turned out GREAT!! I had a little round piece of dough left so I put it in a greased round bowl and baked. The perfect size for a night of spaghetti and meatballs.

I made this bread in my KitchenAid mixer- it doesn't get easier than that. After baking 30 minutes, I removed the bread from the pan right away onto a cooling rack, then buttered the tops and covered with a towel. {It helps to soften the top} I also reduced the sugar to 2T. for more of a traditional white bread. Great!

I have made breads before, but this was by far the best I ever made!  It was so easy, just follow the directions and you have the perfect bread!  I will make this bread again and again.  Thanks!

This is the first time I have successfully baked bread and the first time my family has smelled the delicious aroma of homemade bread wafting through the house! The end product after I halved the recipe, for fear of failing and therefore wasting more ingredients, and further reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup was light, fluffy and not too sweet. I also used unbleached, enriched, all purpose flour instead of bread flour. Since an ineptness for cooking/baking is inherent in our entire family and thus we never bake anything besides premade/presliced cookies, we don't own a loaf pan, so instead I sliced the dough in half after the first rise and punch down, molded each piece into a baguette-like shape and placed them onto a greased cookie tray before the 2nd rise. This recipe is fantastic and easy enough for a beginner like me to make!

AMAZING!  I cut it down to 1/4 C sugar...any less and I think it would have been too bland.

Very Easy and Tasty!  I made a loaf of bread 12 rolls and a bread braid with this recipe.  The dough rose very well--I put the oven on warm and then put the dough in and turned the oven off and it worked perfectly.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe anyone can do it.

I love this bread!  I add 1 TBSP Gluton and 1 TBSP Dough Enhancer while mixing.  I also brush with butter when it comes out of the oven. (To keep the dough soft.)

I love this bread.  I followed the recipe as written.  However, I sprayed the tops of the loaves with Pam spray.  Also, I let them rise in a warm oven, uncovered as other reviewers suggested.  I kneaded the dough by hand for about ten minutes and did not have a problem getting it to rise.

Absolutely delicious. Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and there wasn't enough. It went faster than any thing else. Took a while to rise(almost 2 hours) but well worth the wait!!! My husband is begging me to make more. I'm planning on it very soon!!!!

This is an excellent bread.  A bit on the heavy side.  Next time I make it I will do as another reviewer suggested and cut down on the sugar and hopefully it will come out a bit lighter.

Five stars all the way!!!  I made some pepperoni bread with this recipe, so I cut back on the sugar a little bit.  I halved it if I remember correctly.  The bread turned out fantastic!!  Soft yet firm.  Not too sweet and not too dry.  I love this recipe, and I will be using it over and over.  What a great find!!!  Thanx.

I made this bread for a PWOC meeting and us ladies finished off a loaf of bread in no time flat.  Several people asked for the recipe, so I would say this recipe is a keeper.  I did take the advice of several of the reviewers and only put in 1/4cup of sugar and it was fantastic.  I also made mine in stoneware loaf pans and so bumped up the oven temperature to about 375 degrees.  I will definitely be making this bread again.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe is great, and scales down nicely to one loaf, but I can't give it a score of 5 mainly for reasons that have been stated in other reviews here, and that's the amount of sugar used. A little less sugar makes the bread lighter and less overly sweet. Still, this is a great recipe and I recommend it.

I really enjoy baking bread, especially around the hoildays.  This is the best recipe I've ever tried.  I've made it many, many times and will continue to do so.  My family loves the smell of bread baking and they really give me a lot of compliments when I make this one.  I would rate this a 10 if I could!

Okay, I made this recipe over a year ago and have made it about every other week since then.  My roommates and I can't get enough of it and it has great density to it.  Easy to make.  Really good with sandwiches especially if mustard is used.

Wow!  I messed up and it still came out really good! 

I accidentally only put in 4 cups of bread flour and let it rest for an hour.  I noticed it was still very "doughy" so i added 2 more cups (after the hour rest) and let it rest again.  

After it finishes baking, it looked and tasted great!  Amazing =)

Oh my gosh, we loved this recipe.  i think a big secret is letting it rise long enough. I did everything on the dough cycle in my bread maker until the rising in the bowl.  It came out perfect, my family finished it off the same night. I did cut the recipe in half and it worked out great. It was soooo good, no need to butter afterward, definitely a keeper!!!

It's very good.  Just a little bit too sweet and chewy for me.  In my opinion, this dough is much better for rolls than loaves.

I halved the recipe, used my breadmaker and made cinnamon buns with the dough. The dough was nice and sweet, but not quite soft enough (for my taste) for cinnamon buns.  I may try this recipe again with half the sugar for  a plain loaf of bread.

I discovered this recipe a few month ago and have baked it once a week ever since.
I prefer dense bread and this one is perfect.I will not even try other recipes. Let my Kitchen Aid do all the work.

I found this recipe several months ago, and I definitely should have rated it then.  I have made this bread at least once a month ever since.  (We now have several neighborhood children who wait around for it to be done as soon as they see me making it.)

Very good, great texture. We ate it plain, toasted, and for peanut butter and honey sandwiches. My dog even stole a loaf it was so good. =( I will make this again, and lock Clifford in the garage while it cools. 
I followed the recipe (doubling it thank goodness) and we loved it. Next time I'll try substituting one cup of whole wheat flour. Thank you!

I MADE BREAD!!!!!  This recipe has plenty of reviews, but I just had to add mine to say I MADE BREAD out of INGREDIENTS (not, like, frozen dough...)  and it tasted GREAT!!!!!  YAY!!! Thank you so much for this super-kick-butt-awesome recipe.  (If anyone who knows me knew that I made bread they might also look up and see pigs overhead.)
Did I mention that I MADE BREAD!!???

I am a 6th grade teacher and I have made this bread every Friday for my students for the last 6 years.  It is absolutely their favorite.  I have to have three bread machines going to feed all the hungry faces that appear at my door.

This recipe is excellent. My husband & kids love the bread. I use only 1/4C sugar as other comment & with the help of a KitchenAid, it saves me lot of time & work. UPDATE: 1. I use fast(instant) rising yeast instead of traditional yeast. Use same amount as recipe stated. Just add directly to the bread flour, no proof needed (save you the step for proofing yeast). 2. Then follow the recipe: make sure sugar solved in the warm water (about 110F) & blend oil in (as wet ingredient). Add wet ingredient to dry ingredient. 3. I use Kitchen Aid to knead the dough. Knead about 15 mins or more, until SMOOTH (very important). 4. I add extra 2 - 4 Tbsp water to the dough when kneading since the air here is dry (diff flour/temp/humid will affect how much water needed). 5. Microwave is a good place to proof the dough. I heat up a cup of water in the microwave then put the dough in the microwave (the heated water will provide warmth & humid to proof the dough, don't forget to close the door). 6. Since I only have 8 x 4 loaf pans, so I only use 2/3 recipe to make 2 perfect loafs.

This bread was easy to make and turned out great. I halved the sugar per our taste, and used all purpose flour (I don't know what the difference is). Not too dense, light yet full. Thank you for a great recipe.

I've had trouble trying to get it just right, I live in a higher altitude so somehow I have to adjust it! But even when it doesnt rise perfectly, it's soooo good. Our family loves it with butter and honey on it, YUM. I make this ever couple of weeks, and will continue to :)

Awesome!  It reminds me of my mother's homemade bread! I have made it several times. So good. I think it is the perfect bread recipe to use for cinnamon rolls. I have made it with half ap flour and half white wheat flour...it was wonderful.  I will never use any another bread recipe!  I make bread atleast once a week now. It is just that good!

I never made bread before, let me tell you, I give this recipe ten stars, I cut back on the sugar a bit and brushed them with melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven. The whole house smelled like a bakery. Great memories from my childhood, my mom baked bread all the time, along with her homemade strawberry jelly. I will never buy store bought again, I'm going to try a whole wheat version next.

A great loaf of bread.  I used the recommended amount of sugar and although it was a bit sweet the bread came out wonderful.    One of the best white bread recipes I have ever tried.  Next time I will try to reduce the sugar as others suggested but still a great loaf of bread as is.

This is the best white bread I have ever made! It is great for sandwiches as well as just snacking on it. I took the advice of others and reduced the sugar. I think I am going to try one batch with the full sugar, I think it would probably make a great dessert bread.

Trying this recipe was my first time making bread ever, it was very easy to make and delicious!  Very simple recipe, easy clean-up, and scrumptious.  I have made this 3 times already and now my mother is asking for the recipe.  A must try for sure.

This is pretty good for a white bread.  I'll probably make it again sometime.  I make half the dough into a loaf of bread and made the other half into Monkey Bread.

Amazing! I was so proud of myself when I took this out of the oven - it came out perfectly and looked as though I had bought it directly from the store! I must agree it was very heavy bread but nonetheless - delicious! I wouldn't change/alter a thing with this. Wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

Great bread. It was definitely sweet, but in a way that I would still eat with a sandwhich or meal.  I used a little bit less sugar, but not a measured amount less, I just didn't fill the measuring cup quite all the way up. 

I used all purpose flour because I didn't have any bread flour.

It was definitely pretty easy to make. I made bread one other time before this, but this bread came out really well. Kneading took less time than I expected and all in all it was easy to do this whole process after work, eating dinner while the dough rose and then baking after I had finished eating. 

I made the bread a second time, and this time I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, then added in chopped kalamata olives and rosemary when I was kneading. I made 2 rolls and a loaf (from a halved recipe), and it was very very good.

Great bread.  I used butter instead of vegetable oil and even with this small modification, the bread came out sweet and dense and yummy.

YUMMY and SWEET!  This is my second time baking this bread.  I had originally only used 1/4 cup sugar and found the bread just O.K.  This time round, I followed the recipe to a tee and found it DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  WIll definitely make this again.

I came across this while looking for a dairy-free, non-bread machine bread to make at for my little girl who has food allergies.
 Holy WOW! I was suprised at how good this is. It reminds me of home because I am from Pennsylvania and I could easily get Amish baked goods. 
I followed BreadMan's tips and also substituted King Arthur's Whole Wheat White for ALL the white flour it called for and it was still wonerful! I am planning on making some cinnamon raisin bread out of this for my 2 year old daughter!

this doesn't really need another review but here goes...I was making the bread and didn't have enough white flour so I added two cups of wheat flour...I needed about 7.5 cups of flour to make the dough workable...this could have been because I used wheat flour but who knows...I used my kitchen aid mixer to knead the dough and it turned out wonderfully...the end product was sweet, dense and really filling...my whole family enjoyed it and has already asked for it again.

My husband LOVES hawaiian sweet bread so when I saw that this bread tasted like it I had to try it.  It's a winner for sure!  
We are going to try it as a cinnamon swirl bread as well because we love that in the morning!  
Great recipe and thanks for all the tips!

This bread is super easy and super yummy!  I made one loaf and used the rest to make a few cinnamon rolls.  Neither lasted more than a day.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe! My husband and I don't need to buy bread anymore. We're sticking with homemade now! We substituted the white sugar with brown sugar though (we didn't have any white sugar) and ended up liking it that way. The second time we made this bread, when it was nearly done, my husband cut a little bit into the center of the loaf and poured some butter over the top and let some soak into the center. It came out very flavorful.

I made this with half white/half wheat, and half the sugar.  If I had to make over again, I would use the full amount of sugar.  We thought the bread made excellent toast, but weren't really crazy about it plain or with butter. Might still play around with the recipe though.

very simple and great tasting bread. A little hint of sweet. Will be making this on a regular basis.  
I used a glass pan for one of the loaves and it didn't get as brown as it should have, so make sure to use a metal loaf pan.

I had a very dear Grandmother who made bread for a living. It was always a treat to get a loaf for ourselves because they were always sold to others. She has since passed away. This bread reminds my so much of her bread. It is moist and sweet and a great dense texture. I used half milk and half water. I also made the dough in my bread machine and transfered to my bread pan after the final knead. It was so easy and tasty that I hope to make this a family favorite just like my Grandma's bread.

i am not one to bake much with yeast, however, i made this last nite .  firstly, it was very simple, secondly, OMG it was delicious.  Thirdly, i misted the bottom of the oven and gave the loaves a wonderful texture and moisteness.  This was great and very good for a beginner baker with yeast .  thanks again.  M

I have tried many bread recipes over the years, and they rarely turn out. I am happy to say that this recipe turned out perfectly, (although I used a 1/2 cup sugar);it was still nice and sweet.This smells like heaven when it is baking....mmmm

Excellent!  I am happy to say that this recipe is full-proof as long as you follow the directions and have a VERY warm room to let the dough rise in.  I used the laundry room while drying a load of towels.  Works Great! I used breadmans' review for the kitchen-aid mixer.

This recipe was pretty good, although I would agree with the prevalent opinion that the amount of sugar it called for was way too high. It also produced an extremely dense loaf and, although I ended up adding almost double the quantity of yeast, did not obtain that "fluffy" quality in the end. This is not a bad recipe persay, but it is not anything special either.

May as well add one more review to this amazing recipe.  I made it just as the recipe indicated and did not have any trouble except staying out of it once it was done.  This bread is wonderful! Quite easy to make too.

2-18-2007 This is the first time I've made bread and I had a lot of issues with the rising of the dough. I am thinking my house was too cold. Once I put it in the oven on low it worked I'm thinking perhaps it was denser because of this. I will try again. Also halved the recipe and it may have affected the outcome.

Update 4-12-2007 Ok so I made sure the house was much warmer and I ended up with a slightly different result. However I also added a bit of water to aid with the flour mixing. What a difference! There should be a little more in the recipe. If not the flour sits on the dough and you get a dusty mess. When I finished adding the flour this time (adding water using my cupped hand while kneading) I had a beautiful round smooth ball of dough. I thought the flavor was nicer this time as well. Perhaps use butter or butter flavor or something other than canola spray to coat the pan...the flavor is still there and reminds me of the taste of something fried. Excellent when first warm (we ate half the loaf). Trying toast tonight :)

I have passed this recipe along to so many people... I use 1/2 cup sugar, which is to our taste and usually make at least four loaves at a time. It goes fast here!  Easy to freeze and use later, too.

FABULOUS!!!  This bread WAS dense, sweet, and moist.....and I love it that way!  I did have to bake mine 40mins. The crust was "crusty"...yum.  This is the type of bread I envisioned being served in a basket on the table of a nice restraunt.

Yummy bread! It wasn't too sweet as I was kind of expecting from the reviews. It only had a hint of sweetness, but maybe it's just me. I thought it was great for toast and sandwiches. :] It was dense, and I will make it a second time, as something didn't go quite right with the rising the first time, but it still came out fine. Thanks!

Excellent recipe!  I 1/2'd it to try it in the bread machine - and ended up making it 2x that day.  I'm not usually a bread eater, but a bread maker for sandwiches and this is the 1st one I am eating and enjoying. Next I'm going to try some of the recommendations for substitutions and additions.  I did 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 bread flour - this time I'll do 2/3 whole wheat and 1/3 white to see how it comes out.

This was so delicious!!  I made it with half whole wheat pastry flour and half white flour and it came out perfectly.  Took a bit longer to rise than stated, but I find most bread usually does.  I did not find it overly sweet at all - it was just right!

We will definitely keep making this!

Having never made bread before, i was scared it wouldn't rise.  It did! I was so excited!  It tastes great and it's so easy.  I think i will take some advice from others next time and cut the sugar in half.  It's not horribly sweet, but it would taste more like the bread i'm used to if it had less sugar.

Loved this recipe.  My first success.  I followed another suggestion of 1/4 cup of sugar and had the yeast, water and suger sit for 10 min before mixing in the bread machine.  Also cut recipe ingredients in half for bread machine use.

There is no other bread.......this one is the BEST hands down. Perfect taste, texture, my kids and hubby love it. I make it often as a request for a gift. Last year I was asked to make 300 mini loaves of this bread to give out at our church Live Nativity scene. This bread is perfection, especially hot from the oven with real butter. As for the comments about the sugar......this recipe makes TWO loaves so 1/3 cup sugar PER loaf is about right.

I used all-purpose flour since I didn't have bread flour.  Overall, it was a good bread; however, way too sweet, even after I halved it.  Still, the dough would work well for cinnamon rolls or a dessert bread.

I can't say enough how much I LOVE this bread!  I have just started baking bread and I have tried several recipes and I have to say that this one is the best so far!  I don't think I will keep looking.  I will just keep making this one.  So easy and very delicious.  I wish there were more than 5 stars for this recipe!

This came out really good, however, I was worried in the beginning.  I'm not a regular bread maker, so the directions had me confused.  I wasn't sure how long to let the yeast sit in the water?  Luckily, everything came out good with my judgements.  I served it with cheese and chicken broccoli soup from this site!

AWSEOME BREAD!!!  This was my first time with homemade bread.  I tried this plus a different bread recipe at the same time.  They both were awesome, but this bread can be used for everything, incl. sandwiches!  The other better accompanies a meal.  A KEEPER FOR SURE!!!  Thanks for this recipe!!  ALSO:  I made this recipe AS IS w/o halving the sugar, as some suggested.  IT was great!!  I also put a pan of boiling water in oven under the bread during the rising stage, for 30 
minutes.

Great bread. Nice texture. Sweeter than I expected. It made great toast and sandwiches, but wasn't good to have on the side of dinner.

Excellent bread! I'm fairly new to baking bread but I must say that this one was easy, pretty much fool proof and Very Good. I had seven folks over for dinner and both loafs went right away.

Thanks for this one!

Brilliant recipe! A nice dense bread, just like I've been looking for (airy just isn't my thing). I reduced the sugar some, as suggested by other people, but it still left a nice hint of sweetness and a lovely texture. Due to circumstances, I didn't have the bowl and oil to coat the bread in for rising, so I just floured it thoroughly and it worked just peachily. I think I'll try making cinnamon buns with this recipe, and maybe a braided Christmas bread. Huzzah!

This was very good bread, a little dense but very good. Next time I will reduce the sugar though cause my daughter complained that it was too sweet, but I liked it just fine.

This was the best bread I've ever had.  I lessened the amount of sugar as suggested and also let it rise the second time for a little over an hour.  The second loaf is the freezer and I will def make this again.

This is a great recipe. I usually don't make white bread, but when I do, I'm using this recipe exclusively. Tastes great with homemade jams or jellies. It makes beautiful loaves and they make great gifts. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is very easy & quick to make & bake.  I liked the bread very much.  The texture of the bread is a less fine or smooth when you slice it, BUT that adds to the breads character, flavor, & difference.  The ease, quickness, flavor, texture, & softness makes this recipe 1 that I will be baking repeatedly!!

I just love the texture of this bread. It comes out so soft.. It makes great sandwiches, french toast, and just plain bread & butter or toasted. I like to put home made applebutter on it.
Thanks for sharing Peg.

i cannot rave enough! this bread was easy - and i'm qualified to say so, since i have to mix by hand. it's sweet, but has such a great "bread" taste too. it's light and fluffy and went perfect with our summer-fruit themed dinner. i might have to make this every few days!

Lovely bread!  Nice texture and crust!  I used raw sugar (less sweet than refined) and it was perfect.  I brushed the top of the loaves with egg white prior to putting in the oven and it came out with a beautiful glossy golden color.  This is a great everyday bread!
Thanks!
Edited to add:  I substituted 2 cups whole wheat flour for the all purpose and it STILL came out great!  A little more hearty, still sweet, and I don't feel so guilty!

For my first time ever making bread, this was a very easy recipe and makes a moist and delicious bread!

It is actually sweeter and heavier than regular bread so not very good for sandwhiches but excellent just ith some butter or toasted with jelly.

This bread was fantastic.  I made it on a Sunday afternoon, and kept it in a ziploc bag during the week while I slowly ate it up.  It was still good on Friday night.  I gave one of the loaves to a friend who has demanded that I make him some more.  I think this will become my regular white bread recipe.

Abosolutely best white bread I've ever made.  I've been baking bread for years.  This is the easiest and best I've ever tried.  I did change it slightly after baking it the first time.  I used 5 cups of flour instead of 6.  I also decreased sugar to 1/3 cup plus not quite another 1/3 cup.  It raises perfectly and rolls out smoothly as well.  This is my all time favorite white breaad recipe now. Thanks.

This bread is awesome!  It is also very easy to make, as well as being yummy to eat!  I have made it several ways, from rolling out for cinnamon rolls, to making loaves, and also plain rolls.

Wonderful!!!  I've made this over and over again- it is so moist and light and slightly sweet.  It is a perfect sandwich bread...I used it as the base for my Thanksgiving stuffing, and it makes wonderful toast.

First time that I have made bread using a pan and it rose and baked perfect. It is very soft even the next day. I used all purpose since I was out of bread flour. It was easy to do in my kitchenaid pro mixer--about 5 minutes to mix.I will probably use the other loaf to make french toast. Would make a great cinnamon bread as the dough is kinda sweet.. Hubby said it was "ok" but I liked it. I would not bake it as an everyday bread but once in a while when I feel for something different.  Give it a try.

Beyond Perfection!  I made this exactly as the recipe stated and have no complaints whatsoever.  My past attempts at home made bread have always resulted in a dense, sometimes bland loaf.  Not this loaf, it's fluffy and so flavorful.  I can't be happier.  This is THE bread recipe from now on!  This was also extremely easy to prepare.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer and it took about 15 mins to make the dough including the 10 mins it took to let the yeast foam up.  I can see that this will be something to make almost daily!

Very delicious bread, easy to make.  I don't use a bread machine, so I was looking for a simpler way to make white bread.  This is it.

When I added all the sugar like the recipe asked for, the bread came out really dense.  I didn't care for it but my hubby ate it all within 2 days.

I've made this recipe soo many times, I figured it was time to put in my own review!  Everytime I make this bread it is gobbled up quickly!  I made it once at a Spaghetti Feed party I had and everyone was so impressed!  This was even more delicious when dipped in my spaghetti sauce!  Nice comfort food.

I probably have nothing new to add after so many reviews...  
This bread was really easy to make.  I didn't have bread flour, but all-purpose flour worked just fine for me.  I used the amount of sugar in the recipe and it's sweet, but I don't think it's too sweet.     Excellent recipe!

I have made this several times.  It does require a little elbow grease but well worth the effort, especially if making cinnamon rolls with the dough.  Kneeding the dough is a good stress reliever.  :)

I just made this recipe today.  I made it for my family and everyone really loved it.  I did reduce the amount of sugar like some other people had posted on here.  The next time I make it I will use less sugar, still a little sweet, but very good.  It's a nice & easy recipe...

I love to make homemade bread so i was very excited to try this based on all of the wonderful reviews. I found it to be way to dense and still very sweet even though i only used 1/3 cup sugar.

Yummy bread!  I only used 1/3 (heaping) cup of sugar and I think it worked out well.  These loaves rose very well, and the cooking time was right on.  I made one into cheese bread and it is delicious.  I still think I should have kneaded the dough more so that the bread turns out fluffier.  I'm still new at this, but I would definately make this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at white bread and we love this recipe. We always butter the top of the bread when we take it out. I serve it with the Awsome Slow Cooker Potroast recipe on this site and just had potatoes and carrots and we have a full meal.

I made this recipe this afternoon, and it turned out wonderfully!  I haven't made bread in years, and this recipe was SO easy!  My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again -- probably tomorrow, and many days to come!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, Peg!

I finally know why my fellow Australian mates that have visited the US think that their bread is horrible. It is so incredibly sweet with the consistancy of a tea cake without the frosting and dried fruit mix - possibly a nice serving suggestion???

I always thought that bread was meant to be savoury. 

This is something I would try again but only as a sweet bread alternative.

This is a tasty and sweet white bread. It's a little dense for my taste but I think next time I'll let it rise a bit longer.

This recipe of bread is the finest I have EVER tasted. It was so soft and smelled so good. My husband and I made it at 2:30am and it was so welll worth it. It is slightly sweet,soft and FRESH! We ate so much. I made them into rolls and then a loaf right on a baking pan, (didnt have bread pan yet)and it tasted better then Mrs. SHUBERTS yeast rolls..it was BETTER then hers!! THANK YOU for this recipe..WOOWW!!!!!!!!!

This is a great bread recipe.  I did a couple of things differently.  I used 2 cups of wheat flour instead of bread flour, I also used platic warp to cover instead of a damp cloth.  I didn't have 9 by 5 inch bread pans, so I decided to make one very large loaf in a 11 by 5 inch pan, and the bread turned out wonderful, and the baking time remained the same.  This bread is not too sweet at all.  Maybe I have a sweet tooth and can't taste all the sugar.  It makes for wonderful sandwiches.  The bread cuts easily.  I'm very pleased with the way my bread turned out, and how wonderful it tastes.

The easiest and best tasting bread I have ever made! To actually get 2 nice size loaves, I used 3 cups of water and the same amounts of everything else and still turned out great!

This bread is fantastic!! Great flavor, not too yeasty.  I did lower the amount of sugar to 1/3c and it was just right.  This was my 3rd try at homemade bread and the other 2 were flops.  Thanx for sharing this recipe!

Excellent!  This bread was simply wonderful in flavor, ease of preperation and texture.  I am quite new at breadmaking, but this turned out tall and lovely.  My husband could not wait for dinner and consumed half of one loaf while testing for quality control.  Will make again, thank you Peg.

Great recipe! I found it a bit too sweet the first time I made it, so next time I cut the sugar down to 1 Tbsp, and used half whole-wheat flower. Turned out great, everybody loves it!

This is one of the easiest hand made bread recipes I have used.  The taste is delicious.  The texture is smooth and moist.  Quite the treat!  I will definately make this bread again.

The reviews on this bread aren't wrong, it is fantastic. Yesterday I put in less sugar and added some dill and viola dilly bread. You can make it so many different ways, this recipe can't be beat.

My family devoured a whole loaf in one meal. I used my bread machine dough cycle to do the work for me and it worked out great. I put the wet ingredients including the yeast first and then the dry. I had a picture perfect loaf of homemade bread with very little effort.

Oh my goodness, this bread is so good!  I didn't understand how such a simple recipe for plain white bread could get so many good reviews.  I halved the recipe and made hamburger buns with an egg wash and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The delicious aroma wafting out of the oven was the first sign of success!  They were the lightest, fluffiest homemade buns I've ever made.  I still don't understand how they can be so tasty but they are!

Wonderful!  Very flavorful, soft and moist :)  I rolled the dough up into small balls and placed three of them into buttered cupcake pans, dabbed a small amount of butter on top, and baked for about 20 minutes.  Made the best rolls ever.  I well certainly keep this recipe.

Makes a huge loaf!  Great texture and tastes really good.  I would probably make this again but reduce the sugar because it was really sweet.  I happen to like sweet white bread, but this isn't the best everyday white bread recipe.

Allrecipes is the best cooking site on the internet.  I am always looking for good recipes and this is where I usually find them.  This recipe is one of the BEST I have found.  Just took my first two loaves out of the oven and couldn't wait to try to see if the 400+ reviews were right.  My husband was my guinea pig, and he fell in love with this bread with the first bite.  When I find a recipe that works, it absolutely stays in my recipe file for the duration.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I add my 5-star review to all the others.  Also, I made the dough in my breadmaker.  It worked just great.  I put the oil, water, salt and sugar in first, then added the flour and yeast.  Set the machine on "dough" setting and hit the start button.  After dough is made, divide in 2 equal parts, place in 9x5 greased pans, let rise and bake in normal manner.  TOTALLY WONDERFUL!!

This bread is easy to make, looks good, and tastes great.  What more could you want?  We had it warm from the oven with soup last night, and toasted this morning.  Both ways were excellent.  I did cut back on the sugar as suggested by other reviewers and may cut back a little more the next time.  Otherwise, no changes needed or recommended.

This is such an easy and delicious bread to make. I've made it several times, and each time it comes out perfect. Occasionally I'll add oatmeal or whole wheat flour to the bread to give it some texture, and I always like to bake my bread on a sheet so I can get round loaves. 30 minutes in the oven makes the bread come out just right.

This recipes is insanely easy and very tasty. I did not alter any of the ingredients because, quite frankly, there is no good reason to! My family LOVES THIS BREAD! So what if it isn't multi-grain, or super nutritious. It is what it is. AMAZING.

This is a very good recipe. I braided mine and brushed with egg yolk. I also sprinkled sesame seeds. I don't usually use a recipe for bread ( I do it out of my head) If I should need a recipe this is a great one to use.

This bread is easy to make and very tasty.    I did follow the advice of other and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup -- and even then I though it was a little too sweet, but my family loved it. When I cut the sugar down even more, to 2T, the bread was inedible.  The dough is also excellent for making mini-pizzas, which I top with a chopped tomato-onion-ham mixture or a mushroom-onion-sour cream mixture and then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Yummy!

I used an electric mixer with a bread hook attachment.  The dough has a nice texture and is easy to work with.  I will use this recipe for a change from my normal white bread recipe.  The flavor is very kid friendly and I like the sweet taste. This would make great french toast.  Thank you.

This is a very easy to make bread. It's fairly sweet -- makes a good PBJ or morning toast but otherwise I wouldn't use it for sandwiches. Not rich enough for my tastes though.

It has a slight sweet taste that makes it different, and is very easy to make. It would have come out better if I'd followed high altitude tips, but it still came out very good regardless.

For a healthy vairation this works well for those who are watching diet for their heart. I replaced the 1/3 cup oil with 3/4 cup flax meal.

I have been looking for a recipe that was similar to the one that I was taught how to make bread. This recipe was it the perfect recipe it came out perfect a perfect 5 star bread. ** I mixed/made the whole recipe by hand this helps a lot with  old recipes I found because they are not over kneaded****

I tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago and it was wonderful!  It was quick, easy and it tasted great!  Like another reviewer I used half white and half wheat flour; it made a lighter wheat bread.  The consistency wasn't heavy and the taste was excellent.  I plan to make a couple of loaves to give to a couple of friends.  Thanks for a great recipe!

EUREKA! After years of searching I have finally found an easy, light, and tasty bread! I have made over 12 loaves with this recipe and each one has been great!  I took the advice of reducing the sugar to 1/2 c., but it was good with 2/3 c. too.  If you are going to use sweet toppings less sugar is better.  Also, I "proofed" the yeast until it formed a 1-2" head(15-30mins), sifted the flour, did both risings in the oven set on "warm", covered the loaves with foil the last 10 mins to prevent overbrowning, and brushed the with melted butter after baking.  I have used both all-purpose and bread flour didn't make any difference. Awesome! Thank You!

This was my first attempt EVER at homemade bread.  I wasn't sure why the yeast wouldn't "melt" and ended up throwing away two packages of it.  I figured out that it wouldn't "melt" in the sugar, so I melted it first in the water, then added the sugar.  I wasn't sure what a "creamy foam" was supposed to look like, so I just waited for about 5 minutes before continuing and I made the most beautiful loaves!!

WOW!! This recipe is definately worthy of 5 stars!  I wasnt sure how long to knead the dough, but I kneaded it about 5-7 minutes both times and both loaves turned out perfect! Moist and soft on the inside and the tops and bottoms, browned soo nicely! I had my doubts at first since there werent alot of ingredients but I am so glad I gave it a shot! Thanks for sharing this recipe! I will definately recommend this one to my friends!!

By far, the best bread recipe I have run across.  My friend made homemade apple butter and I was in charge of the bread.  I doubled it and actually got 5 loaves out of it.  I got lots of praise (hey, they think I can actually cook and bake now).  I have already given this recipe out three times.  Thanks!

Gosh..this bread recipe is awesome. I've never made bread before, and this recipe was not only delicious, but it was easy too. It came out perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. In fact, my mom told me not to. The only thing I think I might do differently next time is adding dried cranberries or raisins to the dough. You gotta try this recipe. Its awesome.

This bread was pretty good, but it seemed to dry out quicker than other breads I have made.  I DO live in AZ, which has very little humidity, but this bread dried out in the trip from the counter to the table!  Flavor was good, liked the sweetness of it.

Great, easy bread!  Perfect to start in the afternoon on a cold day and have it warm from the oven for dinner.  It is a bit dense and sweet, but that's what makes it so good!

This was a very simple recipe.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut the sugar some.  The only thing I didnt really like about it is that the bread seemed 'heavy'.  But it cut perfectly and wasnt crumby at all.

This was my first time making home made bread & it came out fantastic!!  I followed the recipe closely & I must admit, I impressed myself.  I made french toast for my mom with it & she raved about it.  I will definitely make this again.

This is wonderful.  It is my favorite white bread recipe; it is somewhat dense and sweet, and it is hard to keep my family from eating both loaves all at once as soon as they come out of the oven.

First loaf of bread I've ever made, and it actually came out pretty well.  It's nice to have real bread instead of that stuff that Walmart calls "sandwich bread"!

We love this bread.  I was concerned because a lot of the reviews said the bread was too crumbly for sandwiches but it came out perfect.  Not crumbly at all and not too sweet either.

This was a good bread.  The kids just loved it.  I found it to be to sweet. I cut down on the sugar, it was much better. I also subsituted 2 cups of white flour for brown.

This is the second time I've baked this bread and, frankly, I don't know what all the fuss is about.  Yes, it's a tasty bread (I agree that the original recipe is too sweet), but it isn't the best I've ever made.  Considering the amount of yeast required I was surprised thatI had to double the "rise times" and I have a toasty kitchen.  I thought that perhaps I had made a mistake the first time but the second attempt yielded the same results. This time I made the second loaf into cinnamon bread and it is very good.

This bread was so good, and so easy to make.  This was my first attempt at making bread and I had no problems.  I cut the recipe in half but next time will probably double it!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

IT'S A KEEPER, FOLKS!

Yes, this recipe IS as easy and delicious as the previous reviews state. I tried it yesterday for the first time and it turned out beautifully!

The colour of the finished loaves is beautiful, the insides soft and sweet... perhaps I may try cutting back on the sugar next time as well, but I like it nonetheless... and it slices up like a dream!

Definately going into my "my favourite recipes" recipe collection!  :o)

This is the best and easiest bread to make. I was thinking of getting a bread machine but, after making this bread, have reconsidered. It didn't take long and the results were phenominal. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I felt this bread was very easy to make; slightly sweeter than normal 'white bread',
yet still wonderful for toast, etc, and very good to give as a gift, it's a welcome surprise.

Let me tell you all...My 14 yr old son begged me to make him a loaf to take it with him to his dad's house...To have a child let alone a boy say "Mommy will you please make me one to take to my dads with me?"...That is saying alot...

Great, simple recipe, very easy to follow although a wee bit too sweet for myself. Bread turned out soft, but, after a day it began to crumble a little. Perhaps that is something I did wrong.

I love this recipe! It's become somewhat of a staple at my house since I first tried it a year ago! I always substitute honey for the white sugar now. Just personal preference. It makes WONDERFUL split rolls (in muffin tins) and tastes excellent with 1/2 wheat flour. This is a nice, basic dough that can be modified to just about any taste, if you know what you are doing. 
Reminder: ALWAYS proof your yeast.

I am not a seasoned breadmaker, but I had a hard time with this bread.  One of my loaves was doughy and weird in the center.  The other was edible and my family did enjoy the sweetness in the bread.

Amazing bread! I made this to go along with dinner the other night and it was 
delicious! I kept snacking on the bread all evening - it was more tempting than 
the fresh pie I made for dessert.

I have tried several recipe for bread but never was satisfied as with this recipe, it has flavor and moist. Also fluffy and yet with no large air holes. Sliced nicely and above all, this recipe can be the basis of other experimental addition. Thank you for sharing!!!

I love this recipe! It was so easy. I used my kitchenaid for all the mixing and kneading so it was a breeze.  I took the advice of a previous review and reduced the sugar to 3 Tbsp.  It tasted delicious. I am never going to buy bread from the store again, this was way too easy and too yummy!!

i loved it. It looked like store brand bread. My kids loved it for sandwiches and just plain with butter. My husband liked it because it didn't fall apart like other homemade breads I have made in the past. I don't have a bread machine so I do it by hand except for mixing it in the kitchenaide mixer.

This bread was very easy to make and I really like how it turns out.  I made one loaf and formed the rest into rolls which I placed close together in a pan.  They were very good.  Good recipe - I'll be using this one again!

Wow! This is excellent. I was looking for a good white bread recipe and this is definitely it. The recipe is also easy to reduce by half, which is a plus. The loaf comes out beautiful and plump. I used the full amount of sugar and didn't think it was too sweet.

This recipe was so easy to make.  We made five loaves last night. After the first loaf, we just had to have more.  I believe we found the only bread recipe we will ever use.  It is just fantastic.

This was the first loaf of bread I ever baked.  It worked perfectly!  The only problem was that I did need to let it 'rest' for closer to an hour and half than half an hour to get it to rise properly...

This bread is great.  It goes very well with chicken salad or about anything else you would want to use on it. We went through both loaves in a day and a half.

This bread is by far the best recipe we've tried.
My husband stopped buying store bought bread, and
started stocking up on flour.  :)  Even without
salt and oil (OOPS) it was still quite edible.
Thank you so much for posting this.

I have been making bread for 10 years now, and this is a really easy recipe. I hate scalding milk for other recipes, and this one only uses water! I spread jam out on a flattened piece of dough, and made a bread jelly roll! It WAS really good!

I made this bread today. I realized I used the wrong flour and it turned out anyway. Just took a long time to rise. But it was worth the wait :) I like the sweetness, I just eat it with butter!

I was very disappointed, remembering the home made white bread my mother used to make.  The crust was missing that home made appeal, to much like boughten bread.  The bread itself was bland and not very hearty.  My kids said it was ok.

excellant bread recipe.  Great toasted or french toast.  Made a fresh chicken breast sandwich, with chicken, lettuce, salt and pepper.  Excellant.  Bread has just enough sweetness to set it apart from "regular" white bread.

This produced two fine grained somewhat sweet loaves that made even slices and wonderfull toast.  They were gone in no time so I can't comment on how well they kept.

This was my first ever home-made loaf of bread.  My kids helped and we all loved it.  My wife loved it too. Half of one loaf was gone and it had not completely cooled yet.  It has a very nice sweetness.  I may reduce the sugar next time to see how it does.

I am not new to baking bread but this recipe did not turn out anything like the reviews I have read.  It did not rise well, there was absolutely no "oven spring" and the resulting bread came out heavy and dense and chewy.  The birds however loved it.  I will try this recipe one more time only because of the many, many positive reviews.

Very easy recipe!  I am not usually able to make bread very well, for some reason my bread won't rise.  This recipe, however, worked great for me!!  I just pulled the loaves out of the oven, put a little butter on the top and now I can't wait to eat some!  My first homemade loaves of bread!!

Finally!! A white bread recipe that I can slice for sandwiches and it doesn't crumble, buckle, squish or fall apart! This is a *wonderful* loaf of bread: chewy, strong, good crumb, beautiful crust. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 for sandwich bread, left it alone for sweet dinner rolls. I am so pleased to finally have a bread that holds it shape. Thanks!!

I used 1/2 whole wheat bread flour and 1/2 unbleached bread flour, instead of bleached flour. This bread came out light and airy (but not full of air bubbles like some breads). Slightly sweet, very flavorful and very similar to the bread available at the Amish farmers market stands. This recipe is a keeper!

This is an easy and tasty bread. We had some fresh from the oven, warm and flavorful -- delicioous! Makes me wonder why people go out and buy less appealing and more expensive bread at the supermarket. I plan on freezing a loaf for use during the busy workweek, so I can keep enjoying homemade bread, even when there's no time to bake it.

I've never made bread from scratch before until I tried this recipe.  I was so proud of it I took a picture of it!!  Glad I did, my son helped himself to a big chunk right out of the top after I got my picture.  Was really good bread!!!

This might be called "Dan 'n' Linda's 10-pound thumpy biscuits."

We are evidently in need of remedial bread dough training.  Perhaps the instructions would benefit from specifying the amount of time to knead the dough.

We couldn't get the dough smooth even after about half an hour of kneading (hmm... did we learn something?).
Perhaps we don't know the right definition of smooth.  It never rose the inch above the pan that it was supposed to.  The bread came out dense with a craters of the moon surface and layers of air and undercooked dough.  An interesting culinary experience indeed.

Any advice would be appreciated.

PS.  The yeast was quite fresh, and all ingredients (except, perhaps, kneading time) were measured carefully.

This is a very easy to make wonderfully sweet bread!  And for homemade bread, it was very quick to make as well.  I only have one loaf pan so I made rolls out of the other 1/2 of the recipe and got wonderful compliments on it as well.  Great sandwich bread!!

Nothing could be easier or give better results.  To the person whose bread ended up too heavy maybe try fresher yeast.

This is a delicious white bread that I have eaten as sandwich bread, as a dinner bread, and have made into cinnimon raisin bread!  I have had varying results based on the type of yeast and bread flour I use, but it usually turns out fantastic.

I have never been able to make homemade yeast bread that isn't tough or doughy...until now.  
This is easy and a hit at my house.  I will never
need another white yeast bread recipe.
Thanks..

The only change I have made is to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I make this recipe at least once a week and all in my family enjoy it(teenagers included).

My husband loves this bread. He loves it as toast with eggs in the morning.  If I don't have any on hand he is always asking me to make more.  The best part is that it is so easy to make that I just cannot say no.

WOW! I have only made bread once or twice before, and this is the easiest recipe, fast and really good! Its a moist bread, not dry, which is awesome! Just the right touch of sweetness in it too. Thanks for the recipe :)

I add 1 egg per loave and 1/3 stick of butter per two loaves. I like a touch more sugar. This is a great recipe to tweek on. Cover the bread with foil and cook for 45 minutes. Rise in 85-95 degree room, like bathroom with a little heater.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  Thank you so much, even though it is not super fast, it is definitely worth all the patience!  My boyfriend and his family devour this bread when I make it, and I have to make it every 2 days!  I am a beginner as well, and the yeast rising was awesome!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Turned out great, i halved the recipie and used regular flour - great results, very soft and sweet. Whenever i made bread in the past it was very hard and tough - i have finally found a recipie that turned out super! Wonderful results.

I tried this recipe for the first time at the WORST time...when we're trying to cut back on our carbohydrate intake. This bread is so good we could eat it with every meal. Slightly sweet taste with a great texture. Froze well. Made great French Toast, too! thanks for a super recipe.

Really good and simple bread recipe.  Much 
easier than the other one I have that requires a 
starter.  Came out perfect on the first try and
everyone love it.  Even my toddlers!

This is a superb recipe.  I had been making a bread using a sour dough starter.  What a pain.  I was looking for a bread that took less time and didn't make my house smell like a brewery. This bread was it.  It is so delicious that we don't buy store bought anymore.. It's easy to make and I get such a sense of pride sending my husband to work with homemade bread for his sandwhiches.

I love this recipe.  I make extra and freeze the loaves.  My husband and son can't get enough of this bread.  I've substituted wheat flour for white and now we don't even buy store bought bread anymore!

This bread tastes so good,  no wonder so many people love it.  Although it took me a good few hours to make it but it worth it.

Super easy.  Rivals the bread made with starter (potato flakes, etc.) that I love so much but is MUCH less work.

This bread has great flavor.  However, the texture was a little to crumbly.

A soft and sweet homemade bread. I don't have a bread machine and my breads are therefore heavier than the store bought variety. This turned out to be better than the rest.

This makes really great white bread.  It can easily be made into wheat bread or even a cinnamon roll.  It has become a family favorite.  When it gets a little stale, try it as french toast.  Yummy!

HELP!  I was so excited to make this bread after reading all the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, and then to my dismay, my loaves came out very dense, kind of "heavy".  I used brand new yeast.  Can someone tell me what I may have done wrong, so I can try again?  Thanks!

This is the first bread recipe I got to work right!  The bread is wonderful...a bit sweet but very soft.  It stays soft for days too- if you can get it to last that long!  I threw out all my other bread recipes and now only use this one.

This was the first bread I ever made & it was very easy.  This is a just simply a rich, delicious bread. Delicious toasted, with a sandwich or just plain.  The only downfall I found with this bread is that I ate a whole loaf myself.

I doubled this and used my Magic Mill DLX mixer. It is like a Bosch mixer. It was so easy to make my 12year old daughter helped out. Turned out great!

This is my first time making any type of bread.
It was easy and my boys love it.
Even my wife enjoys it but I reduced the sugar
for her. It is great with cinnamon and sugar.
This has become a regular treat at our house
for the whole family. It's just like grandma 
used to make.
