This is really good, although I did not use five cloves of garlic. I used one. Albeit, this is not a pesto (nothing gets “pestato”) it is a true dish you’d find in most Italian homes. Fresh ingredients cooked healthily served with pasta. This Italian household loved it and will definitely make it again.
