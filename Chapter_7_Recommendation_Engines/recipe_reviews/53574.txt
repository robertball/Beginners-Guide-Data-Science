This meatloaf was the best!  Not dry, mildly seasoned. Adding the salsa to the meat/pork mixture was genius.  And it went together in 5 minutes.  Perfect!

I HAVE TO ADMIT, WHEN I SAY THE WATER ADDITION, I WAS SKEPTICAL, BUT I GUESS I AM ALWAYS ON THE HUNT FOR A NEW TWIST ON THE MAN FAVORITE MEATLOAF. WELL, THIS IS IT! ABSOLUTELY SUPER DELICIOUS! MOIST, TENDER, & FLAVORFULL WITHOUT BEING OVERLY MEXICAN FLAVORED. I AS USUAL, DID NOT CHANGE A THING ON THE FIRST TRY. AND TO BE HONEST, I WILL NOT CHANGE A THING IN THE FUTURE....PERFECT COMBINATION. I DID USE A WOODEN SPATULA TO LIFT THE MEATLOAF OUT SINCE THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GREASE [I USUALLY MICROWAVE MY MEATLOAF, DRAIN THE GREASE, SLICE, & RETURN TO MICROWAVE WITH GRAVY ADDED] BUT ONCE YOU LIFT THE LOAF UP, THE GREASE IS LEFT BEHIND. WILL PROBABLY BECOME OUR NEW FAVORITE MEATLOAF! THANKS SAMSNANA!

I made this meatloaf for Wednesday night dinner at church.  I received a lot of compliments on the meatloaf, but I wasn't that impressed with it.  It was a little on the bland side to me.  It needed more salt and more pep.  It was not dry and that is a plus.

I didn't really like this. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it, just wasn't for me. It seemed mushy like.

Both my husband and I LOVED IT!!! Based on some other reviews we did add some seasonings such as black pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, and cayenne to the meat mixture to give it a little extra flavor. We also substituted navy beans for the bread crumbs in order to make it a little more diet friendly. I, too, was hesitant about the amount of water but it made for a very moist and delicious meatloaf. There's no way we could have fit it into a meatloaf pan so we free-formed it on an aluminum lined baking sheet but we probably could have divided it into two meatloaf pans and they still would have been good-sized. I've never made another meatloaf other than my mom's because I love hers so much, but this will definitely be going into our regular rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as written except that I used two pounds ground beef and no pork and I mixed the nacho cheese soup in with the meatloaf.  It had a lot of flavor and the 3/4 cup warm water definitely helps, as odd as it sounds.

I did make a change and added crushed tortilla chips instead of bread crumbs. I didn't use the nacho soap but  put queso cheese dip on top twenty minutes before it was done.
