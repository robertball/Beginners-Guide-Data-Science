Wow, this was probably the best meatloaf I've ever made! The changes I made were to omit the evaporated milk (I was making this with 8oz meat, and didn't want to open a whole can for for a couple of tsps), add a heaped tbsp of French Onion soup mix, and I put a thick slice of cheese on top at the end so it would melt down nicely. We both really enjoyed this. Thanks so much!

My family really liked this. I added more mushrooms and as I didn't have any cornflakes I used breadcrumbs instead. I think when I make this again I might save some mushrooms to go on top as well. Hubby said can you make this again soon. Many Thanks.

This tastes just like my favorite burger!  I made this with ground turkey and used over 8 ounces of mushrooms.  I left everyting else the same.  It turned out wonderful!  The whole family loved it.  Even my newly picky 3 year old ate a whole slice.  The prep did take a bit longer than my normal meatloaf, but no reason not to make this again!  Thanks ~TNT~ for the recommendation and NICOLETTE for the recipe!

This is my family's favorite meatloaf!  I've made this so many times, I almost know it by heart.  I've done it with cheddar cheese instead of swiss for variation and I've used regular milk instead of evaporated.  It always turns out wonderful.

I doubled the recipe to make sure there would be leftovers.  Boy, I was wrong.  My family gobbled up everything.  It is delicious.  I love the smell in the house when cooking this meatloaf.

This wonderful meatloaf was a BIG hit in my house.  My boys don't care for meatloaf, but my husband does, so I am always looking for a new way to make meatloaf. For the first time I can remember there were no leftovers.  The interesting variety of textures and flavors made this dish a keeper in my book!

I agree that it was a lot of work for a meatloaf. I also added worchestershire sauce to the mix. It was pretty good, but the cheese was lost inside, so I think I would just stir in cubed cheese if I made it again.

I thought this was pretty good for meatloaf. My favorite burger is the bacon, mushroom, swiss so I thought this was a natural for meatloaf. Unfortunately my family caught on that there were mushrooms in it and even though they ate it, said they didn't like it! The meatloaf they liked best was the That's A Meatloaf from this site. I didn't think it took a lot of time to prepare - no more than any other dinner that you have to do some prep for. It was done right at the time it said. If I were to make it again (just for myself!) I'd put more mushrooms in!

This meatloaf is great. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1/4c to 1/2c of mushroom soup. I also had to replace the cereal with bread crumbs. I added another can of soup to the part can leftover mushroom soup and used it as a gravy when it was served. It was a big success. 2nd time making it I added a package of Liptons garlic onion soup mix and it was fantastic,I will never have plain old anymore. Thanks

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS.. WE LOW EAT LOW-CARB AND THIS RECIPE MINUS THE CORNFLAKES IS AWESOME.. I AM A TWEAKER.. SO FOR ALL OF THOSE TRADITIONALIST I PRE-APOLOGIZE.. 2# OF CHUCK.. 12 OZ. QUALITY BACON DICED SMALL..8 OZ MUSHROOMS CHOPPED..1 VERY SMALL YELLOW ONION CHOPPED FINE.. 6 OZ. CABOT MILD CHEDDAR IN CHUNKS.. GARLIC SALT.. 2 EGGS.. SQUIRT OF LOW-CARB KETCHUP.....  I RENDERED BACON AND REMOVED FROM PAN.. ADDED ONION AND MUSHROOM TILL SOFT.. DRAINED WITH BACON.. COOLED A LITTLE BIT.. ADDED ALL TO MEATLOAF AND AT FIRST I HAD MY DOUBTS.. BUT... IT WAS MAGNIFICENT!! DID NOT ADD ADDITIONAL ANYTHING TO TOP.. I HAD READ OTHER REVIEWS THAT SAID CHEESE WAS LOST IN MEATLOAF SHREDDED SO I HAD CHUNKS.. ADN SOME WERE OOZING OUT THE TOP AND OUT THE SIDE..  TOTALLY AWESOME.. MY HUSBAND MADE SURE I WROTE THIS ONE DOWN 'COZ I NEVER MAKE MEATLOAF THE SAME WAY TWICE... THA MUSHROOMS GAVE AN EXTRA MEATY TASTE, CHOPPED FINE IT WAS HARD TO TELL THEY WERE THERE.. THEN YOU WOULD BITE INTO A CHUNK OF GOOD MELTED CHEDDAR.. WE ATE WITH "SMOTHERED GREEN BEANS" .......

So good.  A little more work than the average meatloaf, but worth it in the end.  I just added a little salt and pepper and about a tsp of worcestershire and used seasoned bread crumbs since I didn't have cornflakes and it turned out great. I sprinkled some fresh mushrooms on the top with the bacon and cheese, and I served it with a brown gravy from a packet, substituting half the water for evaporated milk.  Delish.

This was an amazing meatloaf recipe.... my husband has hated just about every meatloaf I've ever made, and he loved this!  I actually didn't even put in the swiss, and it was still amazing.

LOVE THIS!!! Had to use less mushrooms and onions than I would have liked (my sis doesn't like them), but it still turned out great!!! CHANGES: Added a tbs or so of onion soup mix, used bread crumbs and crushed ritz, added fresh pepper to the onion and mushroom mix while cooking in bacon grease.  AMAZING!!!

Great, but lacking the good topping that I love on meatloaf. I'll make in again, but add an acid based topping to cut some of the richness of the meatloaf itself.

Fantastic - Moist and delicious. Split into two smaller loaf pans and cooked for less time. Good enough to serve at 'fancy' meals... even though its meatloaf!

This was amazing - I even brought some left over to work and people were asking for the recipe. I did make a few alterations, according to some other reviews - but even as a rerun it was still moist and so yummy as the first time. Will totally make again.

I have been looking at this recipe for nearly a month and wanted to try it, but I could not convince my fiance as he is not a big fan of onions or mushrooms. Well he finally gave in and I made it tonight for the first time. It wasn't the over the top bam in my mouth that I expected but it was yummy to me. He wasn't overly thrilled with it but he did say it wasn't as bad as he expected. I only made a few minor changes and those were to use fewer and finely chopped mushrooms, only 1/2 of a small onion, added a bit of worchestire sauce and a little garlic powder.  I added sliced cheese to the top instead of shredded but that was due to looks more than anything. Good recipe, will try again and will play with it more as well.

I tried this recipe awhile ago so I don't remember all the changes I made, but I guess this is an example of why people don't like reviews after changes were made to the recipe! I think I took too much of other people's suggestions/review changes. It seems that the recipe itself would probably not turn out the way mine did. I added some salt and pepper, garlic powder, garlic, and did the cubed cheese thing. All of which ended up making my meatloaf WAYYY too salty. My friends said it was okay, and I normally like some salt in my food, but it was even too salty for me. I gave it 4 stars bc I'm sure it would have turned out fine had I not added so much other stuff! I think the pepper and some minced garlic is good but no more salt! The bacon is already salty enough! What was I thinking?! And I think the shredded cheese would have been fine too. Sorry for screwing w/ the recipe! :P

I DO NOT LIKE PEOPLE WHO CHANGE THE WHOLE RECIPE.  WRITE YOUR OWN AND SUBMIT IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT MANY CHANGES. This was great. My favorite burger is mushroom swiss, which I only order out as I can not grill where I live.  The only change I made was more mushrooms and a dash of worcestershire, and bread crumbs vs corn flakes. I took leftovers to work today and you are a hero, Nicolette.. everybody loved it.

This recipe was a hit! There was nothing left of this meat loaf when we were done eating. I did have to change a few things. I left out mushrooms and onions (hubby doesn't like either). And he said it was awesome. I also used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes, and just used regular milk. It took longer than listed to prepare, probably because I have all-clad aluminum pots to cook the bacon in, and it just takes a bit longer for the bacon to finish cooking. It was worth the wait. We all love bacon and cheese, especially the kiddo, and so we all enjoyed it. Will be making this one again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I agree with what many before me have said--too blah.  Definitely needs more kick.  I may try it again using some of the suggestions of garlic powder, salt & pepper, worcestershire sauce, etc.  I may even try powdered ranch dressing mix.

This was a good meatloaf, but for the end result (taste, work, and calories) it isn't worth to make again. the bacon and cheese get lost in the meat so really you only notice the stuff on top and thats the only flavor this meatloaf had even after I added salt, pepper, and minced garlic. Husband only had one serving and thats unusual for him. But he did take the leftovers for work without complaints.

I loved this recipe! I have had a tough time finding a good meatloaf recipe, and this one was great with a few changes. 

I cooked 5 pieces of thin sliced bacon and added it to the recipe. I layed 4-5 raw pieces on the loaf when I baked it, and poured off the grease as it cooked.  I used sour cream instead of the milk, and used about a half cup. I have always done that because the loaf stays more moist. I used some good Italian bread instead of the cracker crumbs, and I chunked up the swiss cheese as others had suggested. I didn't use any spices except pepper. I know it sounds like I made a lot of changes, but really I didn't. As with all recipes, there is usually room for changes according to your tastes.

We loved this, and I will be making this again! I shared the recipe with a co-worker today too!

This meatloaf was delicious hot/cold, in and out of sandwiches.  Reading the reviews I,too,opted to cube the Swiss cheese so it wouldn't get lost.  Added 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.  I used my slow cooker to cook this, placing the meatloaf on a trivet to allow the fat to drip to the bottom.  My slow cooker runs on the hot side and the meatloaf was done in 5 1/2 hours on Low.

Oh my!  This meatloaf is outrageously good.  I don't like "traditional" meatloaf so I'm always looking for something different to do since my husband LOVES meatloaf.  I made it last night and he finished up the leftovers for lunch today.

This was very good :)but, I made a few changes, which I don't believe alter the original recipe. First off, I used 2 lbs of ground beef. So I used a few extra mushrooms, swiss cheese, and bacon. I wasn't too sure about the cornflakes, so I didn't add them. I used a cup of bread crumbs instead. I added Worcestershire sauce to the onions and mushrooms when they were almost done cooking. I used 2 eggs since I was using more ground beef. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, dash of salt and pepper, and a few shakes of paprika. My meatloaf turned out great! I actually had 2 small meatloafs, which I baked side by side in one large casserole dish. I covered with foil for the 1st 30 min, per other reviews, and then continued baking 30 more min uncovered. Topped with more cheese and bacon and put back in the oven for 5 min. I cooked this for my dad and he loved it. But I can imagine that without the extra spicies, it might've turned out just a little bland. But I really enjoyed this one. Thanks!

It was okay.  I didn't use evaporated milk... like other said, I didn't want to open it for just a 1/4 cup.  I used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes... somehow I don't think the frosted kind would taste all that great. ;)  It was a decent base recipe... my husband loved it.  I thought it was lacking flavor.  Might try other things next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I doubled the recipe and froze one meatloaf for later.  It made a quick and easy dinner.  I added a lot more mushrooms than were called for in the recipes.  My family really like it but I think I prefer my old recipe.  But this is a great change of pace and I will make it again.

My husband's favorite dinner is meatloaf, and he said that this might be the best ever.  I used turkey and precooked bacon to cut down on fat, it was excellent.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This was very tasty. My boyfriend (who doesn't like meatloaf) even made sandwiches with it the next day. I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke to make it a little bit more like a hamburger. I would recommend lots of extra mushrooms. I doubled the ammount and it still did not seem like enough.

I have 2 boys, aged 9 and 7.  The 9yo is the picky eater, the 7yo not so much. Both told me how much they HATED mushrooms and Swiss cheese. They both LOVED this meatloaf.  I doubled the recipe but still hardly have any leftovers to take to work.  I served it with homemade garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Awesome meal!

I served this Saturday night for company.  With my mashed potatoes, this was a big hit (for some persnickety people).  I suggest making just as directed with maybe a little extra mushrooms.  This will be my go to meatloaf. Sometimes you just need meatloaf and good mashed taters.

This was my first time making meatloaf, and thrilled with the results...  It was super moist, and very flavorful!!  Changes I made were no mushrooms only because I didnt have any, almond milk instead of evap milk, breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes, and I didn't top it with cheese and bacon, I just mixed all of it inside of the loaf. But that left it with a crispy crust that was super tasty.  I also let the loaf rest for about 10 minutes after baking, so that it would be easier to cut.  Kiddo and I both went for seconds and theres still plenty enough leftovers for later...excellent recipe!

This meat loaf was different than the usual. We liked it. At first my husband thought it needed something to give it " some kick " because he likes pepper and spicy food, then he changed his mind...he liked it.

Good meatloaf. Next time I'll add some salt for my liking as I found it lacked it.

I added garlic salt, pepper, & worchestershire sauce & it was still bland.    If I make it again, I will add a box of herb stuffing mix instead of cornflakes to give it some flavor.  Also, instead of frying up bacon, I may add precooked bacon bits.

Off the chain Meatloaf!!  I LOVE how the Bacon flavored the Meatloaf.  I made with Cheddar Cheese because Melted Swiss is a little overwhelming in flavor for me.  I used a Lipton Onion Soup Packet because my daughter won't eat Onions (but she can't see the Lipton Onions) and it was YUMMY!!!

we loved this! I did season to our taste with garlic salt, pepper, garlic and herb seasoning and lea & perrins. instead of corn flakes used panko. used fresh sliced mushrooms and diced red onions sautéed in bacon grease. added diced swiss cheese cubes to mixture and additional swiss slices during the last 10 minutes of cooking. YUMMY

This was a really good meatloaf! I almost doubled the recipe but forgot to get the right amount of bacon. I also forgot to saute the mushrooms and onions first. Its had still amazing flavor.

We really loved this recipe, but I did make some changes. I honestly couldn't see using 3/4 of a pound of bacon no matter how much I love the stuff, so instead I reduced it to 5oz of premium applewood and used 2 lbs of ground beef. For seasoning I added minced garlic to the mushroom and onion and a tsp of worchestershire sauce. Didn't have any corn flakes so used my normal crushed saltines. Everyone loved it and truthfully there was more than enough bacon flavor without so much fat.

I followed most of the recipe except for the mushrooms (didn't have any). However, I did have a bumper crop of homegrown jalepenos, so I seeded and diced about 5 small ones and sauteed them with the onions in the bacon grease. Think that was the best substitution ever. The meatloaf already had some great flavors going on, but the jalepenos knocked it out of the ballpark. Will make this one again!

Instead of making one big loaf I made patties & put extra mushrooms on top with the cheese & bacon. They baked quicker & tasted wonderful!  Great recipe - Thank you!

Despite high expectations (Mr. LTH's go to burger is a Mushroom Swiss burger w/onions), this just didn't work for us.  I followed the recipe, though I did bake in a muffin tin to reduce bake time (and  escape the dreaded loaf of meat look).   I also subbed baby bellas for button, per personal preference.  I ate first and wasn't a big fan, but help off on writing a review until Mr. LTH came home and ate.  He said, "These need some spice".  This is ironic because Mr. LTH runs into Mr. Sissypants when it comes to spice/heat.  The leftovers went in the trash, as opposed to the frig.  This one just wasn't for us.  THANKS for the recipe, though!

My husband and I love this meatloaf!  Yes, it does take a bit of prep work but so worth it.  I did make just a few changes.  My husband hates onion chunks so I use onion powder and a bit of minced garlic.  I also add onion powder, garlic, salt, and pepper to the burger.  I always use regular milk and breadcrumbs.  Instead of shredded Swiss I use sliced Swiss cut into chunks, then you find this wonderful melted cheese in the middle.  It also makes a great sandwich the next day...if there are any leftovers!

This absolutely delicious -- and I don't even like mushrooms. ;) Instead of milk, put in 1/8 c of french onion dip and 1/8 cup water, also used Italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. Added a dash of worchestershire, also salt and pepper. Topped with a mix of BBQ sauce and A1 underneath a slice of swiss for the melting stage.

This meatloaf was very tasty.  The changes I made because of what I had on hand was:  I used a container of mushrooms (fresh), I used milk, breadcrumbs and 3 cheese crumbles for the cheese.  I also added garlic powder and a little Worcestershire sauce.  I also served Chubby's Mild BBQ sauce on the side.  My husband loves bacon cheeseburgers so this was a treat for him.

First let me say I love meatloaf! Hot, cold, morning, noon or night. But this recipe just did'nt do it for me. Not that it was bad, it just was not something that appealed to me. Don't believe I will try this one again. But it was worth a shot.

Wow - ten stars. My family devoured this meatloaf, saying repeatedly that I'd outdone myself. My father exclaimed that it was the best dinner I've ever made (hubby and I cook for them almost every weekend!). I added half a packet of onion soup mix and a shake or two of garlic powder. I also made a vegetarian version for myself, using meatless "crumbles" and "bacon".  Although a bit time consuming, making my family so happy was well worth the effort. Thank you for such a great idea!

Really liked this  - I grew up on my mom's meatloaf and thought it was the ONLY one - hmmmm - I think I have changed my mind now. Actually I fixed it when a brother and sister were here to visit - they also loved it.  I did not put the cereal in - didn't have any - I used bread crumbs.

For whatever reason, my bacon didn't produce the usual amount of drippings, so once the bacon was cooked halfway, I added my onion and mushrooms to the pan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe almost exactly (used lean instead of extra lean) and it turned out great. Good on buns the next day with extra swiss and sliced tomatoes too.

This was a yummy meatloaf.  The meat tasted a bit bland though.  I would add 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce and either some minced garlic or garlic powder next time though.  Yummy- just needs some more kick.

My first meatloaf that turned out perfect.  It was tasty and full of flavor, but not overpowering.  It is a bit time consuming to make, but worth it.  It also makes a mean meatloaf sandwich the next day!

I added a touch of A1 and a dash of Chulula to the mix--Awesome!  I HATED meatloaf as a kid (the sweet syrupy ketchup topping kind...bleh!).    I have never loved meatloaf more after this recipe.  It was delicious!

i am giving 5 stars b/c i basically took this recipe, did my own thing and it turned out amazing! the best meatloaf i have ever had/made! i followed it for the most part except made it into a bacon cheddar meatloaf. im sure the mush/swiss is great and will make it that way in the future, but those i was cooking it for preferred i left the mushrooms out. so i saw that i had sharp cheddar on hand and just used that (kinda like a bacon cheddar cheeseburger!). served it w/ the cauliflower w/ dijon sauce recipe from here (omitting the mayo) and drizzled the dijon sauce over it all. yummmy!

Thumbs up from my husband and teen-age boys. The best meatloaf I've tried (so far). Will definitely make it again and have no hesitation to recommend it.

We loved this recipe!!!!  I saved plenty of bacon,mushrooms, and cheese for the top and added them right before taking out.  the store was out of shredded swiss so I bought the slices and tore them up by hand and it worked out wonderful!!!!  The leftovers are just as good (we doubled the recipe).  We added them into beef flavored ramen noodles and made wraps with them.  If you do the wraps add a slice (layer) of cheese to the tortilla before adding the meat.  this is also wonderful with jalapenos if you like spicy!!  We can't wait to make this again!!!  Thank you.  I finally have a meat loaf recipe to compete with his mom's :)

I think I had my hopes too high for this recipe. It wasn't as good as I expected. I love mushroom swiss burgers. This wasn't it at all. The kids didn't like it. My mom just said it was ok. I did like it warmed up the next day on bread. 
This is probably personal preference. All in all it's a good recipe. Just not for us.

This was spectacular!
You have no idea what kinds of horrible meatloaf recipes I grew up with from my Dad's cooking ( think crushed Fruit Loops instead of breadcrumbs and raisins!) so it really took a leap of faith for me to make this! It sounded so good, I had to try.
I used 1/2 beef, 1/2 ground turkey. I used bread crumbs and extra mushrooms. It smelled so good while it was cooking!
It was reviewed as a winner by my family, and my DH said to make sure to make him a car package for his lunch tomorrow!
I will make this again!

This was a very good-tasting meatloaf, though I didn't find it noticeably different than any other good meatloaves I've had.  I approximated ingredients, but otherwise the changes I made, based on what I had on hand, were: part turkey bacon and part regular, half ground beef and half ground turkey, red onion instead of white, canned mushrooms instead of fresh, cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  So...nothing completely omitted, per se, just subtle substitutions which I don't think likely changed the flavor all that much.  I was a bit distracted while eating it when I thought of how unhealthy this dish was.  I don't know if I'll make this particular meatloaf again unless I'm looking for a way to use up a bunch of bacon before it goes bad.  Like I said, not necessarily better than any others.

This is definately a keeper! I miss my Hardee's Mushroom Burgers, and as soon as I saw this recipe, I printed it out and went straight to the kitchen lol.

Brilliant flavour, and it deserves a higher rating than 5 stars. Thank you for sharing Nicolette!

This was a very nice twist on an old favorite dish that helped spice the meal up a bit. Went very well with a baked potato and steamed brocolli.

I used bacon bits after discovering we had no bacon, and left out the mushrooms. Doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. Good thing I did...everyone loved it! We will be keeping this one, and making it again!

Oh my goodness. This is perfect. Made it exactly as written as I always do before I rate it, (because otherwise it would be a new recipe right? lol, pet peeve of mine) And it didn't need a single BIT of tweaking. Boring meatloaf is now a thing of the past! So moist, and just bursting with favor. My favorite burger, turned into my favorite meatloaf. Thanks for sharing!

All you men out there....go for this recipe! Outstanding! I have eclipsed my wife's old recipe. She was astounded.
I realize the calorie count is a little high but with some easy and simple changes you can still have them eating out of your hand. 
1. used 2% milk
2. three strips of bacon.
3. 80% Asiago cheese and 20% Swiss for a total of 4 ounces
4. one pound of 7% grass fed beef and 8 ounces of 7% ground pork

I did not have all the ingredients so that is why the substitutions but, no matter, still the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. It's in the bacon guys!

Best meatloaf ever, I have a very picky 21 year old son and when he ate this meatloaf he had an almost orgasmic response. I have never heard him rave about any dish like he did over this meatloaf. I got phone calls and requests from his friends and friends moms for this recipe. Thanks Nicolette for a fantastic recipe!

This is definitely different from the standard "ketchup" meatloaf. I used mozzarella, chopped cherry tomatoes, and three diced jalapenos in the recipe. It turned out quite well and I will definitely make this again!

This is an excellent meat loaf recipe.And as a bonus,it's gluten free because of the corn flake crumbs instead of breadcrumbs,so my DIL was able to have it.She loved it too.I'm thinking of trying bleau cheese next time.Love to experiment!

I made this for Father's Day, as my husband requested a 'different meatloaf'.  I'm not a fan of meatloaf in general, but this was really good.  You can definitely taste the bacon and swiss.  We used sliced swiss, and just tore it, and I think that worked really well.  The leftovers heat up well, so if there are any, those are good too.

Obviously, you wrap it in bacon, substitute milk for sour cream, and caramelize the mushrooms and onion before you add them. You're also going to want to add salt, herbs, spices, and some pepper or chilies for flavor and color, unless you're some kind of barbarian. Standard meatloaf operation.

This was really good!!! My family loved it, even my picky 15 yr old daughter. She even asked me to make it often. The only thing I did different was I used 2% milk instead of evaporated, but just because I didn't have any. Definitely a winner with us!!

I fixed this dish last night and my husband and I both say it's the best meatloaf we have ever eaten.  The only thing different is maybe a light sauce over the top but, goodness, it is melt in your mouth and you don't want to stop eating it, which doesn't happen with meatloaf normally. Thumbs up!

We love this, I don't like meatloaf so I found this & make it a lot. Sometime I just use the ready bacon if I'm in a hurry.

Although I did a few things differntly, I feel this is a very good recipe to try. My son is allergic to red meat so I changed it to ground turkey. When cookinging the onions and mushrooms I added in 6 crushed cloves of garlic and a dash of salt and pepper to taste. On the meat part I left the egg out as my son is also allergic to eggs but I kept the milk. I added 2 tsp of ground onion powder, 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper and 1 tbs of garlic salt for flavor to the meat. The rest I kept the same and it was delicous. Thank you very much for the basic idea of what you created. It was yummy!

overall this was a yummy loaf. i used 8 oz of shrooms and cheese. only used 10 oz of bacon which i would reduce by a little more next time. i also added garlic and parsley to the onion mushroom mixture. i would use breadcrumbs next time though. i skipped the evap milk.

This was great. I made changes to suit my low-carb lifestyle. I left out the evaporated milk and replaced cornflake crumbs with low-carb pita bread crumbs. I did not use bacon simply because we didn't have any, and I topped the meatloaf with mushrooms instead of mixing them in. I know that makes it not quite the same recipe, but you get the idea. My three year old and husband enjoyed it very much.

AMAZING....I will never make traditional meatloaf again. I used 2 eggs instead of 1, and it was perfect I also used the Hormel Real Bacon Pieces that come in a  bottle, so much easier

This turned out excellent.  I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground pork because my grocer had it already pre-weighed for meatloaf.  I used some extra cheese and portabello mushrooms instead of white and extra of those as well.  I used the food processor to combine the onion, bacon, and mushrooms raw and then fried the contents in a frying pan before adding to the meat mixture.  I also used the food processor on the swiss cheese, which gave nice chunks instead of shredded cheese that can get lost in a dish like this.  I used slices of swiss on the top as well as a few pieces of whole bacon on top of that.  I broiled the last few minutes of cooking time to crisp the bacon and it turned out perfect.  Extra ingredients equaled extra flavor and the presentation couldn't be beat.  Huge hit!  Will make again :)

I would give this five stars if it wasn't for the high fat content. I made this tonight when I just wanted something a little different. It was very good. It is more time consuming then regular meatloaf though. This recipe is definately a keeper.

Very good! I made it just like the recipe called for but I used breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes because I had it on hand. My boyfriend rated it the second best thing I've made, second only to the Chicken Kiev from this site.

My husband really like this.  My son & I thought it was pretty good.  Make sure you serve as soon as it comes out of the oven, otherwise the cheese cool pretty quick and changes the taste.

FANTASTIC!!  I would've never thought of it myself as a meatloaf.  I had guests over and they all raved over it.  For extra nutritional value, I used a whole grain (like oats or other rolled grain) in place of the crumbs and it turned out fabulous!  The topping was necessary - making it perfect!

My wife is not a huge fan of meatloaf, but she absolutely loves this recipe.  She even loves it reheated and placed on a hamburger bun.

This was just okay. The meatloaf was really bland, and there was so much liquid left in the pan after it had finished cooking. I wont be making this again.

I'm truly surprised about all of the rave reviews on this one. I was strictly disappointed. After taking so much time to put this meatloaf together, it was just mediocre in my opinion. The bacon & swiss flavors weren't noticeable, and it simply wasn't tasty. I wish that I would have used my ingredients to make actual burgers. If u do decide to make this, though, BE SURE TO SEASON the heck out of your HAMBURGER MEAT.

I had the kids I babysit and their mom come over for dinner the night I tried this recipe. The kids are SUPER picky and I wasn't expecting much...yeah, the little boy begged to take the last small piece home! We had no leftovers (which I hate having leftover) and it tasted amazingly good. I am not an onion fan so I chopped it up really fine and I am so glad I didn't leave them out because the flavor was perfect. Instead of swiss cheese I used monterey jack for the inside and had brick cheese slices for the top. My husband told me this is the only way I am "allowed" to make meatloaf now! I didn't mind the prep time at all. The work was well worth it!

bland.  Make sure to add some spices to flavor.  Onion soup mix would help.

Even our youngest daughter devoured this (and she claims to not like mushrooms!)  I did make a few substitutes though.  I used bread crumbs, canned mushrooms and a Lipton's recipe secrets onion packet.  It came out great!

This was good - I think because the meat is so lean it took mine a lot longer to cook.  Due to this it became pretty dry.  I love all the ingredients, and the concept of it.  I may try again but with a 90-10 blend that yields a little more grease for cooking faster (in a good way!).  :-)

This recipe is extremely flavorful.  We served it at our retirement home and the residents loved it!  Would love suggestions on how to reduce the fat & sodium content without diminishing flavor.

I love ordering bacon mushroom swiss burgers when we go out to eat, but man they are soooo bad for you.  With this recipe, I used very lean ground beef, Heidi Ann baby swiss cheese, and turkey bacon...now I can enjoy a healthy version of one my favorite guilty pleasures.

Love this recipe. Have made it several times, and it has become my meat loaf recipe.  It is not the usual, I think that is what I love about it.  I also make mine in a 9x11 baking dish, so I can shape it round.  Just like a huge burger!  Yummm!

I made a variation of this using cheddar instead of swiss. Didn't have corn flakes so used bread crumbs. It did taste like a bacon cheeseburger and we really enjoyed it. Thanks!

I must have done something wrong, even though I am sure I followed recipe exactly...This was terrible, and my family likes all the ingredients that were in this meatloaf....my children would not eat it, and my husband did, only so not to upset me...he asked that I not make this ever again...think i will stick to my usual meatloaf...after all, how much can you really dress-up meatloaf?

Good meatloaf, but certainly nothing extraordinary like I was expecting. With the exception of the outside, we could not taste any difference from any other I've made. To me, it wasn't worth the effort in frying the bacon, mushrooms etc. Thanks anyway because it was enjoyed.

This was a very good recipe and hubby approved, too. I really wouldn't call it meatloaf, per say, but it was very tasty! Definately a nice change from regular meatloaf. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything. It's good the way it is. Anyone who likes bacon mushroom swiss burgers should like this recipe. Reheated well as leftovers, too.

There was a little prep time for this recipe, but my husband and myself believe that this is the best meatloaf we have ever had.  I think next time I will add more mushrooms and double the recipe, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I'm not a meatloaf person, but I liked it and my husband and very picky 4 year old LOVED it.  I make two at once and then freeze one since there is a bit of prep time.  I served one to my sister and her family and they are still raving about it!!

This was just what I was looking for in a meatloaf recipe! I added 8oz of mushrooms and grated Monterey jack cheese. This will be my go-to recipe anytime I make meatloaf again. I also used pork and beef.

Was I the only one who gravely struggled with chopping raw bacon? I spent maybe 2 hours trying to chop all of it 2 or 3 slices at a time because I don't have really sharp knives and of course genius me only looked up a better way after the fact, put them in the freezer for a few minutes and chop them frozen, they don't slide around then. I also had a really hard time getting them hot enough to crisp up on medium, I spent like 30 minutes waiting and finally covered them and got the result I wanted. I'm still giving this 5 stars despite my struggles because the recipe is fantastic, I absolutely loved this meatloaf, I just struggled with the prep of it. I think I will also try it with breadcrumbs, the corn flakes gives it a wonderful flavor but it has a meatier texture that I'm not as much a fan of so I will play around with that. Regardless a really great recipe as is and would gladly eat it any day!

I had to make a couple changes out if necessity. I didn’t have corn flakes so I crushed Ritz crackers and I didn’t have evorated milk so I used some sour cream mixed with milk to make the 1/4 cup. This meatloaf was a bit of effort but really worth it. It has good flavour. It didn’t hold together but that didn’t affect the taste at all. I will make this again.

I substituted 1/4 cup of 2% milk, added Blue Cheese crumbles to the top and used about 3/4 cup of crushed corn flakes and I kept the Swiss cheese in cubes about 1/2" x 1/2" so that it wouldn't get lost inside.  My wife? said that my take should be on a menu somewhere!!!

What's not to like? Didn't bother to save bacon and cheese for topping as not too concerned with appearance. Bumped all added ingredients a touch cause... why not?
Little bit more work than usual but paid off all week long.

I've been making this meatloaf recipe for years now and it is by far my favorite. My copy was so beat up I had to print another one.  There were a couple of things I changed due to lack of ingredients kept on hand.  Instead of the evaporated milk I use low fat half & half and I don't normally have corn flakes so I use panko bread crumbs.  I also put French's Crispy Fried Onions on top of the meatloaf at the end, when adding the remaining cheese & bacon, it adds a really nice crunch and flavor.

I'm not a fan of traditional meatloaf.  This was really good.  Missing something though..........haven't figured out what that thing is but once I do this has the potential for 5 stars.

I used full fat ground beef and after I guiltily poured a ton of grease off the meatloaf I thought I had made a mess of the recipe.  Low and behold it was delicious  and a big hit with my 92 year old Dad.  Will definitely make again.

I thought it was ok, because it had a lot of bacon taste.  Felt like it should have a sauce - like golden mushroom one.

I've been trying out new meatloaf recipes lately, and this is my favorite by far!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly - didn't have cornflakes, used panko, not crazy about mushrooms so I didn't include them, added just a bit of basic seasonings like garlic salt, etc - but other than those few things ..... this is an easy recipe, very moist and tasty, and it will be added to my list of "go-to" meals!

Excellent...even my 9 and 11 year old kiddos enjoyed it.  I left out the mushrooms this second time around and kids went back for seconds.  Great in leftover meat loaf sandwiches, too!

I was really  looking forward to this, but have to say I was pretty disappointed.  As I was mixing everything, I was concerned about the lack of seasoning (the recipe doesn't even include salt & pepper) so I added some black pepper and worcestershire sauce.  I didn't want to overpower the bacon, onion and cheese flavoring, but in the end, this meatloaf really needs something more, in my opinion.  Also, the cheese totally disappeared in the finished product, so perhaps cheese cubes (as someone else suggested) would do the trick.   I like the idea of this meatloaf, but will make lots of changes next time.

Very moist.  Sub. motzarella instead of swiss, used 2 TBS of whole milk instead of evap.  Was a huge hit and I don't generally like meatloaf, hubby doesn't like it with any red sauce.

This was really good, a great change from old fashioned meat loaf.  I didn't want to open a can of evaporated milk for 1/4 cup, so used regular milk.  I also substituted turkey bacon and it was great, plus saved some calories and fat.  I only had sliced Swiss cheese and cut it up, but not sure you could even tell it was in there, maybe chunks would be better as some reviewers have suggested.  I will make again.

Followed the directions and my husband loved it.  If your family doesn't like mushrooms, they'll never know they're in it.  Will make it again, grandkids will love it because of the bacon!

Very tasty, the gf and her kids loved it.  I also doubled a later batch and experimented by using porridge oats (rolled oats, oat bran, flax and wheat bran) with a tin of low salt  beef broth with an extra egg for the binder.  It cuts down on some of the garbage fillers people use  and it's still full of flavor and nutrition.

Very delish. I never used evaporated milk. I always used either regular milk or 1/2 n 1/2. But everything else was great. I can't see how some thought this was a lot of work for meatloaf...just cooking the bacon and sauteing the onion and mushrooms?

Very good. My husband and I really loved this recipe. I used mozzarella cheese instead of the swiss cheese and a small can of chopped mushrooms intead of using fresh ones. Will definitely make again

Hubby and I loved it, kids, not so much, but my kids are impossible to feed any way. I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes, but other than that, made it true to recipe. This is a keeper!

I have to tell you I have always said "I don't like meatloaf.  It just sounds funny, Meat Loaf.  But this recipe has totally changed my mind.  WOW.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I just added french onion soup mix and this was so awsome I ate a whole bunch and so did my grandson who is 2.  Hours after dinner he was still grubbin on mine.  My daughter and her boyfriend loved it.  I now like meat loaf, well this one anyway.

I have had better recipes for meatloaf and worse.  So I rated this one mediocre.  I don't think I will cook it as long next time because mine was a bit over done.  I love meatloaf with a bit of Italian sausage in it and I may try that as well.  It wasn't a bad taste, not just my favorite...personal opinion.

Great combo for a meatloaf.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  It makes great day after sandwiches too.  A little greasy, but you have to pour it off a couple of times and put the finished meatloaf on a serving platter so it doesn't lie in the grease.

It needed more cheese. The next time I make this I will divide the meat and layer full thin slices of swiss cheese on it.My family liked it but agreed it needed more cheese. Very easy to put together.

I'll say 4 stars reluctantly.  I thought it was average at best but the wife thought it was great.  The kids ate it but didn't have an opinion one way or the other.  I'd make it again in a pinch as I usually have the ingredients on hand.

I made this dish for my wife after she came home from a hard day at work. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes; we loved it although it could have used more cheese, and seasoning. (I doubled the ingredients and failed to add enough to the meat) All, all it was very good.

One of the FEW times I've truly followed an ALLRECIPE recipe..... and it was very good - not "the Best" deserving 5 stars but very good. The next time .... I will increase the cheese, double the mushrooms, and perhaps a couple of diced jalapenos ..... just like I like my cheeseburgers. My wife suggested the bacon wasn't needed, but I think it was a nice touch. The cooking instructions were perfect and it came out juicy and moist without any greasy taste. You should try this one on a Sunday afternoon!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written; however, it was extremely bland and my 8yo would not eat it; however, my 6yo ate it as long as she had ketchup to dip it in.  I will not make this again.

Good, good enough that my husband actually went back for seconds.  We both felt that the meat lacked a little bit of flavor.  Will probably make again, but add some spices for more flavor.

My husband said he liked this, after stating he usually doesnt like meatloaf.  It is very tasty and not your usual meatloaf.  I used ground pork because it was cheaper than the ground beef.  Its quite a greasy, heavy dish and I tried to pair it with lots of vegetables to balance it out.  Good for meatlovers, like my hubby.  I will definitely make this again.  One correction that should be made, however, is that prep time is listed as 20 minutes.  This is very misleading.  It actually took me closer to an hour to do all the chopping and browning the bacon.

Worked like a charm on my meatloaf protestors. I followed the directions for the meatloaf, but topped it with sliced bacon, sliced portabella mushrooms, and a mixture of mustard and kechup with cracked pepper and chives. Then topped that off with sliced swiss. It was so good. I doubled the recipe and made and extra meatloaf for the freezer.

An OK meatloaf, maybe.  It sounded better than it really is.  Mushroom Swiss burgers are tastey for sure, but this combination just doesn't work. There are about a million meatloaf recipes out there, don't waste your time with this one.

Interesting recipe. This took darn near an hour and a half to cook through. I had to drain all the fat off when it was close to being done because it was swimming in grease. I did a layer of Swiss in the middle, as well as a sprinkling on top. That was the only thing different I did, aside from increasing the mushrooms. It was tasty. My youngest kid LOVED it, and he's not much for meat. So, that impressed me. The rest of us liked it, but I'm not sure we liked it enough to make it again. Don't let that deter you if you are thinking of making this yourself.

This was awesome! I changed a few small things: I used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb mild Italian sausage, subbed mushroom gravy for the evaporated milk, subbed bread crumbs for the corn flakes and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the onion & mushroom saute...Oh, and I left off the cheese and bacon on top...It was delicious! Best loaf I have ever made! Prep time really is pretty long though, next time I will do double and freeze half.

Try it, you'll like it :)

My family loved this.  I ran out of swiss cheese so did my second pan with chedder.  It was good and a great way to make meatloaf (since I don't like meatloaf).  This was a great change but the prep time was a little more than I wanted.

added extra mushrooms, and extra bacon, it was an awesome flavor, but i think the cooking time was too much, Next time I will cook it not as long as suggested. Still, I hate meatloaf and I thought this was VERY good!

This recipe gave meatloaf a different taste, although not particularly what I expected.  For the amount of bacon in the recipie, there is virtually no taste of bacon in the meatloaf...possibly the swiss cheese overpowered the bacon.  Next time I would probably try cheddar cheese.  I added extra mushrooms as other reviewers suggested.  For the time involved, I am not sure it was worth it but will keep the recipe for occasions when I am in the mood for something different.

Best meatloaf I have ever made!  Added some minced garlic to the onion.  Also used ground turkey instead of beef.

I thought this was delicious--it tasted like a bacon cheeseburger.  Three of my kids and my husband loved it; my son doesn't like mushrooms so I might try it without them next time for the sake of pleasing everyone.
