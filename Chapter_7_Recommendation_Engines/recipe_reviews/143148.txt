Having never tasted a traditional Bolognese sauce before, I have nothing to compare this recipe with. Having said that, I really liked the way this turned out. I did add two bouillon cubes instead of one, because I like more flavor. Next time I would also add more seasonings, like garlic. I simmered this much longer than the five minutes specified in the end of the recipe. It really does get better the longer it simmers!

This is such a healthy way to make a pasta sauce.  I made a few mods:  added garlic to flavor the lentils while they were cooking, and I used prepared tomato sauce.  It's important to cook the lentils until they are really soft, so I added more water at the end until I liked the consistency.  Yum!

I really enjoyed this. It came together quickly and tasted great! I took the advice of others and added a whole veg bullion cube (1/2 a cube was one serving so I doubled it) and added 2 cloves minced garlic w the lentils. I also added a bay leaf w the tomatoes and some dried basil near the end. I'm vegan and this is a quick recipe I'm adding in regular rotation. My boyfriend (not a vegan) added Italian sausage cooked separately to his. Delish!

Maybe I'm just not a big fan of lentils but I found this recipe kind of bland and not comparable to a good bolognese sauce. Perhaps it should be called Lentil and Tomato Sauce? My baby loved it though!

I made it wrong, I put in enough water to boil noodles instead of 1 3/4 c like the recipe called for.  Consequently the sauce was very runny, even tho when I realized my mistake I measured the water out.  That said, I was disappointed.  I used flavored tomatoes and the sauce was still bland.  I did like the use of the lentils.  I'd give it one star, but I have to give it a little credit for my mistake.  May try it again correctly, but not sure if it is worth it.

A good base, but definitely needed a little more in the way of flavor. I personally ended up adding some mushrooms, spinach, dried basil, and fennel seeds.

bland. I tried to season it up w/ garlic, a bay leaf, and some italian seasoning. It didn't help. The lentils needed to simmer for a very long time to get flavor in them. Not similar to a bolognese sause at all.

This was pretty good--at first I thought it was a little bland but I added some red pepper flakes and it grew on me.  I added extra garlic, basil, parsley and oregano and used jarred pasta sauce instead of canned tomatoes.  I used WAY more water than it called for because the lentils just kept absorbing and they took about 40 min to get soft.  I don't care for the firm lentils.  We have vegetarian twice a week so I'm always looking for something different.

The basics of the recipe are fine but I'm glad I read the comments first. I left out the veg bouillon cube added 1 T each of oregano and basil, 1 tsp of granulated garlic. And because we like our sauce with a little heat, 2 tsp of red pepper flakes. 

I also pulsed a package of baby bella mushrooms in the food processor until they were chopped very fine and added them into the mix.  This made the sauce a little thicker and "meatier" so that even my carnivore husband LOVED it. 

Finally - a small can of tomato paste. End result: a much thicker more voluminous sauce.

Yum! Having read reviews before I made this I went ahead and made some changes. I cooked the lentils with garlic and used one can of diced tomatoes and one part tomato sauce. I also added spinach, mushrooms, basil, and red pepper flake. I also ate it over tomato spaghetti which  it was great with. I'll definitely make it again but will probably use a tomato paste instead of sauce because it was really too runny when it was finished so you missed a lot of the tomato flavor. But it's definitely a good base to dress up with other veggies and would be great with some veggie Italian sauce mixed in.

So this recipe was a delight and definitely something I will make again. My tweaks were simple- I cooked the lentils first. In another pan I saut√©ed some onions until see through and then added some chopped garlic. Then I threw in the diced tomatoes and added some red wine (wine always makes pasta better - among other things :)!) and the veg bouillon cube and cooked the wine down a few minutes. By then the lentils were cooked so I added them to my sauce and cooked a few minutes longer to meld the flavors. I mixed the lentil sauce with wheat pasta and of course threw some cheese on top for good measure. The flavors were wonderful and the lentils gave the dish a heartiness but also a creaminess. Next time I'll add mushrooms for more meatiness and spinach for extra nutrition. So many variations can be had here. Truly a keeper of a dish.

I changed the order of cooking the food items.
Sauteed the onions first, then added the rest of the ingredients, brought to boil, and turned down the heat and covered to simmer for half an hour. 
Not bad.  Not spectacular... but a good meal.
