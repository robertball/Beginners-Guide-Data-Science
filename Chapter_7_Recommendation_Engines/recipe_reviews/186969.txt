Here is the deal - either cut the Ranch mix in half or double the sour cream....you could add mayonnaise to it too.  A whole package of Ranch is a lot for 1 Cup of Sour Cream - that said - we are Ranch lovers and this was great.  Thanks Fireguy553!

Pretty good. I used the dry ranch seasoning mix from this site, with dill and minus the salt, and real bacon bits. I also used a sharp white cheddar I bought on sale at Grocery Outlet early last week. I served it with Stacy's Pita Chips. We all liked it. I think next time I might add some chopped green onion.

I was so excited to make this, and was so disappointed. This was so salty.

I thought this would be amazing because I love each and every one of the ingredients but it was a let down. Not nearly as good as I hoped. I wouldn't make it again.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make another version: 1 c. ranch dressing, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper. The salt is then eliminated! I used this to dip my Southwest egg rolls in.

I have served this recipe at a couple of parties with Kettle Chips- any brand will do but i love the Salt/Vinegar flavor and so do my guests. Since the salt level in the dip itself is pretty heavy,  when making, I cut back on the bacon bits by 1/4 of what the recipe calls for and added 1/4 more sour cream than what the recipe calls for and that leveled it out enough. At my parties, the reviews were great as the dip is always gone QUICKLY. This is so easy and with the kettle chips its simply... an indulging intake of salt but with cocktails... it works! The key is balancing with other appetizers!

This was too thick to use as a dip   We added a little milk to thin it out and still too thick. Very disappointing
