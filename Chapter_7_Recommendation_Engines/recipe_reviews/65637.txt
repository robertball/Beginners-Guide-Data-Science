ATTENTION: If you want your "fish" patties to turn out with more of a meat texture, purchase firm or extra firm tofu and freeze it before using.  Then, thaw it in a colander and squeeze ALL the liquid out of it before you slice it. If you do not squeeze out the liquid, you will end up with a patty that is mushy and the breading WILL NOT STICK. If you are using the traditional block of tofu, slicing it into 5 or 6 slices also helps.  Kelp powder is made from ocean kelp and adds lots of nutrients plus gives it more of a "fish" flavor.  If you don't use it, its still good, but don't expect too much of a "fish" flavor.  Excellent recipe if you use these tips!  Thanks for a great recipe for vegetarians!!!

I pan fried this in a little olive oil.  I topped it with red onion, pickles and mayo.  My wife really liked it (and she did NOT like the idea of tofu-anything).  She agreed that we'll have this one or two times a month!

Great recipe. I added a little extra garlic powder and paprika to the bread crumb mixture.  Pan fried the 'filets' in olive oil instead of baking and used store bought mayonnaiserelish spread.  My husband likes warm condiments and cheese so I put the sandwhich in the toaster oven with a slice of cheddar cheese.  We are both big fans of tofu, really enjoyed this recipe and will definitely make again, Thanks!

I think this recipe has potential, but there is just one thing that really turned me off about it. The tofu slices were just way too thick for my tastes. I did three slices as directed, but sliced the fourth one in half. Those thinner ones came out super crispy and much more appetizing. I didn't have kelp powder, but I added some Old Bay to give it a little seafood flavor. The tartar sauce was yummy. Thanks for sharing :)

I'm rating this 5 stars, but only with a 1 major change in the recipe... fry fry fry it!!    I used lemon pepper old bay seasoning rather than the hard-to-find kelp powder, and i also used seasoned bread crumbs.  it came out a tad bit too salty, but crispy, fishy and yummy!  one more suggestion: open the tofu a few hours before cooking, and use paper towels and a weight to dry it out.

This was my choice as my birthday dinner this year (really fancy, I know), and it was so simple that even my boyfriend could make it!  I did advise him to fry it, however, which really made the tofu firm up a little and crisped the breading.  I think this would satisfy any vegan/vegetarian or fish-eater!  Loved it!

This was okay - followed recipe exactly, except on preparing tofu. I found the crumb mixture a little too salty. Next time will not add any salt and not pat as much bread mixture onto the slices. Also, not much "fish" flavor, however, I still ate the whole thing as I love tofu. As others may have mentioned prepare tofu by freezing it - I always throw my plastic tubs of tofu into the freezer when I buy them as I like my tofu to have a meaty texture when cooked. Then thaw in the fridge. When it's thawed cut into slices and press between absorbent paper (you can really put a lot of pressure to extract the water without tofu crumbling when it's been in the freezer). You can then cook it however you want to -I won't prepare tofu any other way no matter what recipe I use. I also buy the extra firm tofu. No problems ever with the plastic tub bursting open in the freezer either. Bottom line, I give this recipe 3 stars as it wasn't anything I thought was super delicious.

Fantastic! Instead of a 1 cup break crumbs I added 3/4 Cup Bread Crumbs and 1/4 cup Nutritional Yeast.

Minding everyone else's suggestions in regards to crispiness, I decided to cut the block into 12 pieces, after pressing and straining the tofu.  I also added 3 Tablespoons of Nutritional Yeast Flakes for some added protein and fiber.  There seemed to be too much breading mixture (or it just wasn't sticking) with the amount of oil that I used (about 2-3 Tbsp), so I re-oiled them and re-coated them to use up all of the breading.

Last, I baked them for an extra 5 minutes at 450, for additional crispiness.

I wouldn't change any of the steps the I altered.  They came out delicious.  I ate them as nuggets, with a side of spinach, rather than in a sandwich.

I gave this recipe a 5 star rating after I made one change. I couldn't find kelp powder only kelp granules which I now use as a very good salt alternative. The first batch with the kelp granules was ok but didn't taste much like fish to me (likely because of the granules vs. the powder) although the texture was good and the taste was ok. For my second batch I crumpled up, almost to powder form, 2 sheets of nori (seaweed sheets used for making sushi) and they were much, much better. I put the crumpled/powdered nori sheets in the same bowl with the olive oil. After swirling it around in the oil and nori mixture, I then put it through the breadcrumb mixture. I baked mine to save some fat and calories and they came out just great! A couple of my coworkers tried some of what I brought for lunch and they loved it. After the addition of the nori for more "fish" flavor, this recipe is definitely a keeper and has become a part of my regular menu! Extra firm tofu works best and you must be sure to drain the tofu before handling. I followed the advice of a tofu chef I saw online who recommended to place the brick of tofu on a plate lined with paper towels and place a cutting board with two canned goods on top of the tofu to press out the extra water. I did this for 15 minutes and the tofu was perfect. But you can only do this with firm or extra firm tofu, otherwise you'll squish it flat! ENJOY!!

This was okay..my kids loved it, but I thought it was just "o.k" It was pretty bland, I wish I would have added more seasoning to it. I cut them in bite size pieces and pan fried them in a bit of olive oil. I may make them again for the kids.

This was my first attempt cooking tofu, and it was a huge success! I used "roasted garlic and savory spices" breadcrumbs, and I think that really added to it! I also baked it for 10 minutes longer than suggested because I wanted it firmer. It was great though, and I definetly plan on making this again!

I did as other reviewers suggested and froze the tofu first, then sliced into strips.  I breaded it with a "seafood breading" mixture that I picked up at the grocery store--much cheaper and easier to find than kale powder.  Then I pan fried it rather than baking--still, very good and highly recommended!  I made the tartar sauce in the recipe and liked it very much!

Although I've been a vegetarian for awhile, I've never been a fan of tofu. This recipe is only my second attempt at using tofu, and it turned out a hundred times better than the first. I thought that it baked and tasted really well and was very easy to make

This recipe was quick and very simple.  I froze and thawed the tofu first to give it a denser texture.

This is a fantastic recipe....I did freeze the tofu and did get the "meatier" texture...the only thing I would change is adding more kelp powder probably 2 tsp instead of 1 and that's it...this is "added" to our menu permanently :) !!!

Though I prefer Jennifer McCann's Tofu Fish Sticks, this recipe is good. I just wanted to say...anytime I make     tartar sauce I add about 1/4 of an onion to mine. The taste is way better. This one is just really bland. Also if you know you are going to be eating fish the day before make it that night so the flavors combine really way.

I made these for myself and my vegetarian sister, along with two meat-eaters, and every one of us was impressed with how good they were, especially taking into account the simplicity of the recipe. My only advice is to slice the tofu a little thinner than recommended (about six slices per package of tofu), or they get a little bland.  I only gave four stars because the tartar sauce was inedible. Sorry!

This really does taste just like fish! I used triple kelp powder and added flour to the dry ingredients. I also froze the tofu then defrosted in the microwave and squeezed out all of the water (as suggested by another reviewer)You must do this it makes it like a true fish fillet. I fried it in a small amount of veggie oil till brown. Then put them on a bun with tarter sauce, tomato and lettuce. I tell ya you cannot tell it isn't fish. Thanks for the recipe everyone loved it. I will be making it again soon!

I did not have kelp powder so I did my best to crush up nori-sheets along with the breadcrumbs in a blender.  These were easy to make once the tofu was prepped; I froze mine, thawed, then squeezed out most of the water before using in this recipe.  I also made a vegan slaw to put on top of the sandwich (didn't use the dressing recipe) and it was so good!  Thanks for a great idea!

This was alright. It probably would have been better if I had fried the tofu, but a lot loss healthy. I didn't find it had much of a "fish" taste, so maybe next time I will increase the kelp? All in all I found it to be a bit bland. It was still edible and I liked it, but I would probably look for another recipe next time I make something similar.

My husband and my meat-eating husband both loved this recipe. Definately drain, freeze, thaw, and then pat dry before cookings. I also put the breading along with a little flour in a gallon ziplock bag and gently rolled the fillets to coat.  Oh, and I used garlic salt and ommitted the extra salt. I ended up cooking them for 25 minutes on one side and then flipping them and cooking them for an additional twenty minutes on the other side to get them nice and crispy.

I was really unimpressed by this.  The tofu just doesn't "crisp" up at all.  The breadcrumb mixture didn't stick well to the tofu after baking (fell off in places).  In the end, all I tasted was breadcrumbs and the tartar sauce (with the tofu giving a very odd, squishy texture to it all).   
I'm sure this would be decent if you enjoy tofu, but this is just cementing the idea that tofu is NOT for me...

This is actually pretty good!  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I wish the tofu were a little "crispier" (without deep frying it).  After 30 min in the over I upped the temp to 400 to see if it would crisp up...but it didn't.  But it is still pretty good (the tarter sauce makes it good)...I would def make it again.  

Alterations:  I did add a slice of Kraft cheese and used pre-bought tarter sauce.

Like every other rater on AR - I do make changes to suit my tastes. For the breading I used 1 part flour, 1 part cornmeal, and 1 part panko breadcrumbs. I fried the tofu in grapeseed oil and made my own vegan tartar.
Will definitely be in my rotation.

Giving 5 stars because my husband (who is allergic to fish) raved about it like crazy.  We eat tofu all the time and this is a nice new way to do it.  I only set out 1/2 cup of bread crumbs which was more than enough.  I also couldn't find kelp powder, so used some dried seaweed strip that I ground up myself.  It was a nice dinner, I would like to try with the kelp powder if I can find it in my market next time.  Also, I used lite firm tofu, and I always freeze it, then thaw in the fridge because I like the texture better that way.

Very good mock fish fillet, but I cut my tofu into strips to make sticks.  I added more seasoning then called for & since I didn't have bread crumbs on hand and didn't want to take the time to toast bread, used ritz crackers, but forgot to omit the salt so they were a tad bit salty.  I'll definately make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loved this, even my 3 year old ate a whole sandwich and asked for another patty. Be sure to drain the tofu thoroughly and the breading will stick well. I didn't have any fall off. I baked them and sprayed non-stick spray on the tray and on the tops of the patties (flip half way through cooking, but most of the crispiness comes when you toast the buns. I cut the tofu in 7 slices. I used prepared tartar sauce. These even reheated well in the microwave! Great recipe and really easy!

I tried this as I had bought Tofu to make a pasta salad and had some left over.  Maybe it is because I didn't make the sauce but it was bland and didn't get crunchy - it just seemed soggy to me.

Didn't cook good! The bread crumbs fell off while cooking. I ended up mashing it all togeather (like eggs) then putting it on bread. My hubby liked it like that!

I liked this recipe baked rather than fried. I've never has a fish filet before so I don't know if it's similar but I liked finding a different way to prepare tofu!

My husband liked this, but I thought it was only OK.  There's nothing wrong with it, it just wasn't exciting.
