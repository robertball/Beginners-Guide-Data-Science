Easy Recipe to follow and make.  I thought I could cheat and not let it chill for as long as the directions said...WRONG!!!!  The flavor wasn't as intense as when it had chilled the 8 hours!!!!  Delicious pie~

Also excellent as mini-truffle tarts! I made a cookie crust using 80 crushed vanilla wafers and 12TB melted butter and pressed that by spoonfuls into mini-muffin tins, baked it for 12 minutes, then filled with pie filling when crust had cooled. Delicious appetizer for parties!

This was crazy easy and just as good!  I don't understand some reviews that criticize the intense chocolate flavor.  Did they read the ingredients?  I accidently used 1/3 cup of sugar rather than the 1/4 called for and I could have handled the lesser sugar (I'll be more careful next time).  My store was out of chocolate cookie crusts, so I used a pre-made shortbread crust and I loved the contrast.  I topped the whole pie with Easy Devonshire Cream from this site and shaved chocolate.  My only problem is that I at the last piece last night and I don't have enough cream to make another right now ;).  Thank you for my new "Go-To" chocolate fix!

Wowsers!  What a hit these were!  I made as mini truffle pies (used the vanilla wafer crust in a mini muffin tin...bake at about 350 for 5-8 minutes...don't burn them!  1 box of wafers made 30 tarts)  I used wilton icing tip 1M to fill these little babies.  They were decadent and gorgeous!  I will be making again and again!

Delicious!   I've made this twice now, to rave reviews. I made the following adaptations: I used a cheesecake pan and made an orange milano cookie crust.   I made one layer with dark chocolate, let it chill for an hour and added another layer using milk chocolate.  (used full recipe for each layer, only didn't add sugar to the milk chocolate layer). Chilled overnight and topped with whipped cream. Amazing.  Tastes like a truffle! I will be making this again and again.

if you like a semi-sweet chocolate chip then you will love this. I personally prefer my chocolate a little sweeter. I made the mistake of using plain whipping cream (not heavy) and thought it was going to be like soup, but once chilled it was very puddingy. I put it in a shortbread pre-made crust and topped it with whip cream to cut the chocolate a bit. I also added about 1-2 tablespoons more sugar. It was great! I think I may try it next time with milk chocolate chips. Thanks!

I made this at Thanksgiving, and it stayed around longer than the other two pies I made.  It was good, but not great.  It tasted exactly like what it is, melted chocolate chips in whipped cream.  There is no depth of flavor.  Would be fine as a single layer in a layered chocolate pie, but doesn't stand alone well.

This was so good, for sure I'll make it again.  
One tip, do not add more sugar.  While mixing I added more sugar (it tasted bitter) to make it sweeter and WOW. It was sweet. Just follow the recipe.

Made this twice now. SO GOOD. The 2nd time I made it I had a little more luck, thanks to a mishap. I nuked the cream and chips as directed, then I started whipping the 2nd half of the cream. Doing 50 things at once, I added the vanilla and the sugar to the cream in the mixer, thus making it a little stiffer. As I added the glops of chocolate, and mixed, it got super fluffy and awesome. You really have to make sure the cream/chocolate stuff is room temp before you mix it into the cream or it'll deflate. This is sitting in the fridge now, mocking me, waiting for tomorrow (thanksgiving!) I'll top it w/ whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Pics to come! (I hope)

This was good, perfect texture for a truffle pie, but needed to be a little sweeter.  It had a real semi-sweet chocolate taste.  If I make it again, I'd have to use the milk chocolate chips instead.  This might be perfect using the mint chocolate chips.....the possibilities are endless.

The pie set beautifully but it was very sweet and rich.  Served for a large group I can see every last morsel being gone but not for us.

Wow!  Incredibly rich but yet light (not meaning calories!) The only change I made was increasing the sugar to a scant 1/3 C since some said it wasn't sweet enough.  Adding a dollup of Cool Whip adds some extra sweetness too.  Don't sway from the cookie crust, it is a must!  I cut into mine after 5 hours and it held up perfectly.

Clearly, something didn't work out.  It was closer to fudge than a mousse.  My chocoholic wife enjoyed it, but she's happy with  dark chocolate chocolate chips.  I think if I had folded the whipped cream in with the chocolate mixture, it probably wouldn't have killed the fluff.  Still just tastes like melted semi-sweet chocolate to me. ROUND 2 RE-REVIEW: I can admit when I made a mistake.  Make sure the chocolate mixture is completel cool.  When you think it's been long enough, wait a little longer.  If the chocolate mixture is warm at all, it will turn the whipped cream into liquid, and you will get fudge. If you are a hard core chocoholic, make this with bittersweet chocolate chips. Not for the faint of heart, but you will be a hero to those that can't find deserts chocolate-y enough for them.

I have been making this pie for years and add a teaspoon of almond extract or a quarter cup of Kahlua. It adds the little bit of zip that takes it to another level.

VERY chocolaty. If you like rich, dark chocolate, you will love this. If not, you should probably pass. Rich, rich, rich.

Sorry...but, this turned out like pudding...not fluffy at all.  I was skeptical when the directions said to beat the chocolate mixture on high into the whipped cream.  First of all, exactly what I thought would happen, happened.  It deflated the whipped cream.  Secondly, I don't think 3/4 cup cream is enough for the whipped cream portion of this recipe.  Maybe I can whip some more cream and then try to scrape the chocolate out of the pie crust...and, fold it together.  Sigh...  I was planning on serving this for Thanksgiving tomorrow, and I'm so disappointed.  I'm not going to waste anymore of my gourmet chocolate chips to try this again.  I may need to make some whipped cream and pile that high on top of the pudding filling.  Sorry...

OMGosh!!! This is now my "go to" chocolate pie!!! I used 1/3 of the given amount of semi-sweet chips, and 2/3 of the amount in bittersweet chips, and stayed true to the rest of the recipe. My whole family loved it! Super easy to make and super yummy to eat!

I only got one slice!my 4 yr old "helped" me make it, and it was nice being able to let her lick the leftover filling.  I am not sure what I did wrong but it was a bit too hard to cut, it fell apart but still tasted delicious.

Very good and VERY chocolatey!!! The first time I made this recipe I used a ready made graham cracker crust. It was delicious but too decadent for 1 serving. This time I used individual shortbread tartlet shells and phyllo dough cups, much better!!! Topped them each with a raspberry. I preferred the shortbread the best. The taste of fresh fruit and shortbread balanced the taste of the chocolate perfectly.

Hate to say it, but this recipe is a disaster. I agree 110% with another reviewer who said "It tasted exactly like what it is, melted chocolate chips in whipped cream. There is no depth of flavor." It is sickeningly sweet and tastes like you're eating a slice of melted chocolate chips. In a bad way. An entire bag of chocolate chips goes into this one pie.....I realized things weren't going well when I tasted the finished filling, so I added the rest of the carton of heavy cream and a little salt and lime juice to counteract the sweetness, but it was still just way way WAY too much sugar and chocolate. And this is coming from someone with a major sweet tooth, I assure you. If you want to impress someone with a chocolate pie, stick to a tried-and-true chocolate silk-style pie, because I can PROMISE you, if you bring this pie to a function, it will not appeal to everyone.

The title of the recipe is 'RICH Chocolate Truffle Pie.' Please stop complaining about it's richness - it says so in the name, so you should've expected it! That said, I didn't find this too rich for my taste. However, I can see why some might like a smaller portion - my mother couldn't finish an entire slice after Christmas dinner. I will be making these again in a mini muffin pan; I think that will be the perfect 'bite' after a meal or at an event.

I am a HUGE chocolate lover so that is why this gets a 3-star rating.  Definitely very rich.  My problem with it is the consistency.  I did not find it fluffy, but rather quite dense.  It almost reminded me of fudge that did not quite set properly.  I think it needs a little work to become a 5-star recipe.  It did disappear quickly, though.

VERY easy to make and cheap to make too.  Taste really good but very rich.  I only had milk chocolate chips so I will get semi sweet next time and I bet it will taste even better.  I didn't put it in the fridge for a full 8 hours I only did about 3 but I was switching it from the fridge to the freezer back and forth and it seemed to work just fine.

Wow - this is one rich chocolate pie! After a huge meal, my guests could only finish half of their slice since its so heavy.  The recipe is easy, delicious and a crowd pleaser.  Will definitely make it again.

When using whipped cream in a recipe you fold the whipped cream into the mixture in order to leave the finished product light and fluffy.
Sweetness or too much sugar is just a persons preference, I would have tasted the whipped cream while beating to see if it really need 1/4th cup.  Also that is WAY TOO MUCH Vanilla.  Most recipes like an entire cake usually call for 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Never seen a recipe to one tablespoon for 1 pie............  type error?????    Suggestion when whipping the cream the cut the amount of sugar back to 1/4th cup.  Do not beat the whipped cream into the recipe, gently fold it in the mixture. Also make sure you add only 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture

Gorgeous! Easy! Rich! --  I ate most of the batter before it made it in the crust. I used Milk Chocolate Chips instead of Semi-sweet, just a personal preference. I thought this was fairly obvious - BUT - If you're not a chocolate fan, don't make this. Don't knock the rating cuz you didn't read the ingredients. CHOCOLATE. CHOCOLATE. CHOCOLATE.  Wonderfully, simple and very decadent. Super tacky with my tin foil store-bought Oreo Crust. Will make that from scratch next time. Thanks for this recipe!

Made this for a potluck. It set perfectly and I topped it with whip cream! I didn't even get to try a piece because it was all gone by the time it was my turn for dessert! It must have been good though, judging by the compliments :)

Oh my, this is super rich and so yummy! I loved it. My mother-in-law is somewhat of a chocolate moose expert and she gave this one a two thumbs up! I'm definitely making it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Heavenly, rich chocolate.  I made my own oreo cookie crumb crust instead of using store bought.  VERY quick to make.

A true chocolate lover's dream! I made this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it!  Be warned though, for the "normal" person this is quite rich but still delicious.

I loved this and so did my 17 yr old babysitter that had Thanksgiving dinner with us. Everyone liked it but it was "too rich" for some. I say bah humbug it was perfect. If you don't like rich chocolate then don't make this or eat it. Maybe it would be better for some to take smaller slices if they think it was "too much"

Very Rich! I used milk chocolate chips, instead of semi-sweet - personal preference.  Because I used milk chocolate, I didn't add any extra sugar at all.  Also, I don't own a microwave, so I just heated the cream just to boiling, then poured it over the chocolate chips and let it set.  Then stirred the chocolate chips until smooth. The pie is creamy and wonderful.  My family loves it.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this recipe using a pate brisee crust, instead of the cookie crumb crust. The saltiness of the pate brisee complemented the chocolate so well. The texture of the chocolate after chilling the pie is luxurious and decadent, and the genius of this recipe is in its simplicity.

I made this for a family gathering and I'm glad I licked the beater, spatula and spoon because that's the only taste I got. (A very yummy taste, I have to say.) I cut it into 12 pieces and even with the other desserts available, it was gone in no time. Easy to make and there's not a morsel left? Five stars! I'm looking forward to making it again--and taking my own piece first!

The taste was a bit too sweet (but not too chocolatey!) for my liking, so I'd probably make the pie sans the chocolate next time. Also, I let my pie sit for 24+ hours in the fridge, but it still wasn't whipped enough, and it began melting almost as soon as I took it out. Any suggestions on how to avoid this issue? Other than that, the pie was delicious and easy to make!

Wow, was this good! Next time I might even add 1 1/2 bags of chocolate chips to the 3/4 cup of whipping cream, then add 3/4 cup of the whipped cream- This was so good and fast! This is now going to be my 'go to' chocolate pie!

Easy, yes! Tasted good but I thought it was too sweet. I will try again without the sugar or with darker chocolate, maybe I will just scoop it into dishes.

I'm not sure mine turned out right, it wasn't fluffy.  But I was pretty impatient after I tasted the chocolate/cream mixture.  So, pretty positive that the chocolate just wasn't cooled down enough to be added to the whipped cream...lol...but it's still AMAZING!!! :)

Yummy! Well this is all that the title promises. I'm a definite chocolate lover so this was perfect for me. Tasted like the inside of a truffle. Sooo good. Didn't last very long around here though and I only got a small piece. Thanks for the recipe.

YUM!  My favorite pie when I was growin up was French Silk.  I try not to eat it too often now but this pie was a close second!  I think next time I make it I will use a regular pie crust instead of chocolate.  My kids helped me make this and had so much fun licking the bowl clean!

Everyone adored this recipe. I am a huge fan of milk chocolate, so I even tried this recipe out with Milk Choc Chips instead, and it was very creamy and smoothe, delicious! I had friends and family taste test which was better, and they recieved 50-50 reviews.

This was a big hit on Thanksgiving. I melted the chocolate chips on the stove because I always scorch it in the microwave. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it came out wonderfully! This is a keeper!

Great! For those who say the filling didn't set right - you MUST wait for the cream and chocolate mixture to reach room temp before incorporating into the whipped cream or it will collapse the filling. I placed mine in the fridge after microwaving to melt to get it to cool faster. The finished product was perfect: a slightly heavier chocolate mouse: super creamy but still light texture that went wonderfully with the fresh raspberries I served over top. 

I even 'recycled' a flubbed chocolate cookie batch from the day before by using overcooked (too crispy!) chocolate roll out cookies to make the crust - they worked great! I loved not having to waste them!

Oh my goodness.  A half-slice of this pie will 100% satisfy the most intense chocolate craving.  I froze this pie in individual slices so I would be less likely to over indulge.  No need to defrost, it's a great consistency straight out of the freezer.  I plan to experiment with alternate crusts as the cookie one I purchased did not hold up to the amazing filling.  A small dollop of slightly sweetened whipped cream and a strawberry or two would compliment the richness of the pie.

Made this for Christmas dessert. I realized late xmas eve I was out of vanilla so I had to omit it, then I added a couple of tablespoons of brewed espresso. I also added a bit more sugar. We loved the consistancy, very chocolate mousse like. Everyone raved. This is soooo easy and good, a keeper. 
Next time I will add the vanilla but I will also add the espresso again, I think it adds a nice touch. Make sure the chocolate is cool and don't be afraid to beat it on high when adding the chocolate to the whipped cream. It turned out great.

This pie is scrumptious, but you cannot eat too much of it...I would say it is more than 8 servings...other than that I would not change anything.  I did use very good chocolate in the recipe and it was loved by everyone that tried it.  Easy easy easy and delicious...what more can one ask for??

This is a very good dessert.  However, I didn't use chocolate chips,  I used good quality bittersweet chocolate and folded the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.  My experience tells me beating it in would deflate the filling.  Folding is more time consuming but worth it.  Also, instead of vanilla, I used a coffee liqueur.  Actually, any liqueur or rum would work very well as a flavouring.  My family loved it!

This is a good pie.  I added a tub of cool whip because it needed a little something extra for me and well that was it.  It went fast with the family!

We really liked this pie a lot. It tastes like a good chocolate mousse. How good depends on the quality of your chocolate. I omitted the sugar (and would do that again). In the future I would make my own crust (that's always the best!) and for a variation I would add a brick of cream cheese for a depth of flavor and to help it keep shape at room temperature. This makes a great freezer pie, too. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was omitting the sugar because I thought the semi-sweet chocolate chips were enough sweetness.

I had trouble with it at first, because I was unfamiliar with whipping cream.  Once I got the hang of that, though, it has been a breeze every time I make this recipe.  It is so great people have a hard time believing it's homemade and not from the local restaurant!

Easy and delicious. It is VERY rich, but so worth it. I used a full two cups of whipping cream, since I didn't want to have to bother with the remaining 1/4 cup in the pint. I was a little worried that I had ruined it as I was beating the last of my chocolate into the cream. It was a little bit liquid-y for a pie, but it set up nicely in the refrigerator, and was a favorite at Thanksgiving!

I love chocolate, especially when it's rich, but this was too much. I made this for my inlaws and was not proud when I took a bite. Nobody said they loved it and neither did I. Maybe it was the chocolate I used.....I don't know....I used Nestle, but usually prefer Ghiradelli's. Followed the exact recipe.

Incredibly rich and decadent. I used non-dairy whipping cream and made a crust from vanilla tea biscuits which was a nice foil to all that chocolate. I wish it had been a bit more fluffy. Next time I'll be sure to cool the chocolate mixture completely, mine was a bit warm and perhaps that was the problem. But this is definitely a winner!

This was amazing! I just did a test run of this pie ( I will be taking it to the Bf's parents house for thanksgiving) and it was great. VERY rich but we loved it. My second pie I am going to try milk chocolate chip. Adding a little extra cream to the whipped cream was great too, added more fluff to the filling. Will be making this for christmas too.

Excellent recipe. Now for myself I prefer a darker chocolate. And you can get special dark choco chips now. So I made a quick little ganash 1 to 1 choc to cream, and spread it on the bottom of the shell. Then fill the remaining space with the original recipe. . . Smaller slices are a good thing ^_^.

Much too sweet to be eaten in large pieces. But very good. My husband suggested cutting the pie into small pieces about 1X1 in.

Rich is exactly the right word to describe this dessert! This pie was unbelievable, and soooo easy to make. I think next time I make it I may use less sugar. I used ghiradelli 60% cocoa chips which gave it a very rich flavor.

Absolutely Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used half milk and half semi-sweet chocolate. The texture was excellent and the taste was right on. It is definitely rich, as other reviewers mentioned, but that's what makes the pie so great.

Very good, like others had said very rich. I topped with fresh raspberries and fresh whipped cream which really helped cut the rich taste. I also used milk chocolate chips and a shortbread pie crust which I will use again. I liked the combination. Next time I will add an extra 1/2 cup of whipping cream to make it a little more fluffy.

really easy & good. I'd whip 1/4 C. more cream next time.  Tips: make sure the chocolate mixture is really cooled or it will melt the whipped cream and you'll get pudding. Also, gotta use heavy whipping cream (not just whipping cream) for this kind of pie as the fat content is high enough to keep pie fluffy.

I thought the recipe would be sweet enough without the powdered sugar and I was right. There's enough sugar in the chocolate chips.  All in all, a very good and easy recipe.

Delicious!  Also great as S'more Pie - Stir in a whole bag of mini marshmallows (10.5 oz) before filling two graham cracker crusts.  (My kids love that there are marshmallows; I love that it extends the recipe so you can share!)

delicious!! like other reviewers said, it is very rich -- way more than 8 servings. i also might try using darker chips next time, as it was a tad bit sweet for me. everyone who has tried it has loved it though!

Chocolate and cream - what's not to love.  Served it with a dollop of whipped cream on top.

Just perfect!  Excellent recipe & no worries about undercooked eggs.  I usually make my own crust but decided to try a premade crust.  The crust was just as good, cheaper & quicker.

Get out!! This was divine... easy to make and a big hit. Hubby asked for a chocolate pie for his birthday - but didn’t want the silk kind. He approved of this recipe!  Will make again.

Made the chocolate filling just as called for, but didn't have the chocolate crumb crust on hand.  I made a crust using 3 tablespoons melted butter mixed with 20 smashed Oreo cookies and lined the bottom of an 8 X 8 baking dish.  Poured in the filling and after refrigerating overnight, it was sinfully rich and delicious.

I found this too sweet for me.  But the maker did warn that it was going to be rich, so I feel like it deserves 5 stars anyway.  Really, aside from it being too sweet, it was amazing: easy and turned out beautifully.

I added a bit of cinnamon, which I think went really well.

This lives up to the "truffle" name. This was actually too rich for my blood (I'm embarrassed to say!) But SO delicious! I put this into a baked pie crust (rather than the chocolate crust) and it was just wonderful.

Made this yesterday for Canadian Thanksgiving. It was, by far, one of  the best pies I've ever had. A one inch slice was plenty for most as it's fantastically rich. Ten stars for this recipe. 

I made this exactly as directed, including taking notes from the reviews, such as ensuring the chocolate has cooled before adding to the whipped cream so it doesn't deflate, and only adding one third of the chocolate at a time, etc. While making it I was worried I had done something wrong as recipe says "spoon into crust" and mine could be poured. As well it didn't look as fluffy as the featured photo by "Tricia Winterle Jaeger" (I've added a photo of mine). Just now I viewed the "watch how to make it" video by Allrecipes and they pour the chocolate into the crust rather than spooning it, so do keep this in mind if you, too, are able to pour yours!

I had a beautiful whipped cream, and the second I added the chocolate mixture - just a small amount - it deflated and became soup. Very disappointed.

Kids thought this was great!  Light and fluffy but a bit sweet for me.  Will try with dark chocolate chips next time.  Best to make a full day ahead of serving so the pie fully sets.

Delicious and very easy to make.  Used a crust made of crushed Oreos and melted butter. Topped with Cool Whip.  My family (chocoholics) loved it.

Made this several times. Great, quick easy recipes with good results. Some tips that may help... If too rich, try using either a nicer chocolate than chips like ghiradeli or other gourmet chocolate. Cheaper option is half choc chips and half milk choc chips.  If the melted chocolate mix is too hot, it will deflate the whipped cream. Easier yet, mix it all and chill in a bowl. Once it starts to cool, mix it with your beaters. It will make it light and fluffy. You know it has cooled enough when the mix turns into a lighter color when whipped

This is an awesome pie. Simple and fluffy. The others that said it isn't fluffy just didn't do it correctly. I whipped my cream a little stiffer and waited until the chocolate mixture was cool enough, mixed on low and wa la, perfect pie.  It does need to be served as a small slice (no matter how they look at you), (they think you are being stingy) but, they understand as they eat it -RICH !!!!!!!!! One pie goes a looonnngggg way. I also used a crust made with chopped pecans, butter and almond flour....very good for a crowd.

This is amazing! I have made it several times and my only precaution is to follow the recipes exactly -- especially when it comes to cooling and chilling. I pair mine with the Graham Cracker Crust I and a whipped cream "frosting" and there is never a piece left.

This was so rich and so delicious.  My three daughters (twin 8 yr olds and a 7 yr old) and I made it for my dad for his b-day.  I did do a little extra to help cut the richness a little and that was to top it with fresh raspberries and homemade whip-cream.  I think that was the perfect finishing touch to this amazing recipe.

I mistakenly thought I had semi sweet morsels at home and then I ruined my first batch of bittersweet chocolate. So, my chocolate mixture ended up being 8 oz of bittersweet chocolate bricks with a big scoop of Nutella. I used a regular pie crust and I'm glad I did because this pie was rich! I'm not sure if that's just the description of this pie or the fault of my concoction. Anyway, with some homemade whipped cream on top, this was great. Texture is great, very smooth.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy enough to make without a microwave or mixer -- I just did it the old fashioned way with a stove and a whisk. Still almost no effort to make, and tastes like something from an expensive restaurant!

I've made this pie several times now, every time by hand, and it's always gone within two days. It's very rich, but I've found a layer of whipped cream on top helps a lot. Whipping that much cream by hand makes your arm fall off, but it's so worth it.

For variation, I made a half Chocolate, half Peanut Butter chip pie. My family thought it was much better than the normal chocolate, though I prefer the plain chocolate. I think I made the peanut butter layer too thick for me. I just made one with a layer of chocolate and a layer of mint to take to my grandmother's, and I think that one is going to turn out just as well.

Brought this to a party and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! This will satisfy even the purest choco-holic :) I used milk chocolate in place of some of the semisweet (half and half I think). Yum! Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make. I only had 1 1/2 hours to chill so I put the homemade oreo crust in the freezer while I prepared the filling. I put the melted filling that I had microwaved in a glass bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice  and kept stiring it every few minutes to cool the chocolate down as quickly as possible. After I filled the pie, I put it in the freezer for about an hour. It was PERFECT! Not frozen and just the right consistantcy. I did add orange extract instead of vanilla and my dinner guest really enjoyed it.

This was SOOO good! I ate the extra filling with a spoon from the bowl and its so rich! I made home made pie dough and kneaded in chocolate chips instead of doing a prepared cookie crust. Yum!

In a word, scrumptious! For the best results, use the best chips you can afford. I used the Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chips and this was so rich, delicious and decadent that it was gone within the hour (I made it as one of several pies for a baby shower). While I am a huge chocoholic, I did use a vanilla wafer crust in place of the chocolate. I felt it needed that contrast for a more complex flavor contrast with the rich filling and it really was quite delicious.

This is a fantastic pie!  It was very easy to put together.  Followed the receipe exactly.  It's really rich, so topping with whipped cream is a good idea!  You do want to keep it chilled.  If you leave it sitting out in the summer it will "melt".

Flavor was just what I wanted and this couldn't be easier.  Mix the cream well.  Mine wasn't fluffy enough and was more fudge-like which was totally my fault.

AMAZING! I was looking for a RICH chocolate pie, and this turned out PERFECTLY. The texture is so thick, but rich. Very easy to make too (except for the part where you have to wait 8 hours.. haha..) Only thing I would say is that it CAN be too sweet (it makes me feel guilty), but that's not a problem if you're a sweet tooth. Anyway, I normally don't do reviews but this was too good! Will DEFINITELY be making it again.

A fabulously easy and foolproof recipe. A crowd-pleaser. I omitted the sugar entirely and it was sweet enough! I also served it with chocolate-dipped fresh strawberries and some fresh whipped cream. It is essential to serve this at room temperature, makes all the difference!

I made this once following the recipe exactly (well, I put in a rounded 1/4 c. powdered sugar) and it was so good.  Unfortunately, I'm lactose intolerant, so I had to just have a bite.  I tried making it tonight with whole milk (lactose free) and it didn't work at all.  It didn't "rise" or make the soft peaks because the fat content wasn't there.  So, I put it in the freezer and we'll see how it turns out!

Very easy pie! I love dark chocolate but I wasn't in love with the pie. If I do make it again I would add a lil bit of sugar like a few of the other reviewers did or maybe use semi-sweet instead of bittersweet chocolate. But, it was pretty good just not orgasmic.

Solidifies nicely with less cooling time than listed.  Dense and chocolaty, but there's nothing really remarkable about it.

Wow, this is super rich.  I followed directions as is and I think it would have been better if I mixed the semisweet chocolate with some milk chocolate.  You only need a tiny sliver to satisfy even a chocoholic.  I would also recommend adding some whipped cream and fruit to break up the intense chocolate flavor.

SOOOO RICH and SOOOO GOOD! Not for those that don't like rich sweets though. Reminded me of pie from the cheesecake factory. I put a little of cool whip on top when I served it and I think that it took away from the pie. It was smooth and creamy. I followed recipe exactly. The whole family loved it! I will make again and again.

So easy and really really rich!  I folded in the whipped cream instead of beating it and it worked beautifully!  Will try with 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 milk chocolate next time.  Thanks!

This pie is delicious, but very rich!  You will definitely want to have a small piece.  The reason I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is because I felt the taste of the powdered sugar was a little too strong.  I will definitely use about 1/2 the sugar next time.

This was so rich it felt like heaven in your mouth! It was so smooth and  light it was as if I was eating a chocolate cloud. I did do some things differently.... I did not add the chocolate mixture 1/3 at a time, that was an accident but it still turned out great just less high then what the picture shows.  I also used a graham cracker crust because I could not find an oreo one which turned out to be a change I would keep. Because it is soo rich the graham cracker crust balances it and stops just short of the "TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE" line. It was great with a cup of dark coffee!

Brought this into work today for our thanksgiving luncheon, and it was a hit!  Simple to make.  I added sliced strawberries as a garnesh and it helped cut the sweetness from the chocolate.  It stayed firm, even though our conference room was extremely warm.  Will definitely make this again!

SO EASY AND SOOO GOOD! EVERYONE LOVES THIS!!!  I didn’t want to turn on the beater so with the recipe (kid asleep) so I actually mixed in about half a tub of cool whip vs the whipping cream for step 2 and it tasted about the same and makes it a little less calories (: But use whipping cream at least for first step).  And I used dark chocolate chips but regular are just as good! Also I have made in mini cheesecake pan with oreos as the crust and those are great too!  Top with whipping cream and chocolate sprinkles!

This pie was way too sweet and rich. This was even too much chocolate for me - who knew?

I made this last night for a Mother's Day dinner, and it was a HUGE hit!   The only changes I made were, instead of using a prepared pie crust, I used a home-made chocolate graham cracker pie crust, and then I added more confectioner's sugar (2 teaspoons) to sweeten it up a little bit, since my mom isn't the biggest fan of semi-sweet chocolate. The result was absolutely delicious, and not a single piece of pie survived the night. Thanks for sharing!!

so good I'm speechless!! I bought a pint of heavy whip and didn't have a use for the extra half cup, so I just added to the 3/4 cup which was whipped separately but I didn't change anything else.  I can't believe how EASY and AMAZINGLY GOOD this pie is. I can't wait to make this for our next big family gathering.

So delicious that it borders on life changing.
This recipe is that rare combination of easy preparation, divine taste, and potential for gorgeous presentation -- 5 stars all the way.  Thank you Marbalet!  I topped it with devonshire cream and sliced strawberries, and savored every bite even though I normally do not enjoy chocolate desserts.

This definitly suited my chocolate tooth for the night... Just a little too rich and not enough balance in chocolate and sweetness, just thought it needed something else. A small piece will do you fine, added a dolop of fresh whip to it and still it didnt sweeten it up. Perhaps a mix of semi sweet and milk chocolate?...

This is the second time that I have made this pie, and I can't believe how good it is! I followed the directions exactly as they were written and both times it came out perfectly.  This is definitely one of the best chocolate pies ever!

this pie is just delicious!  I would definatley be ok with having this in my fridge at all times, for that chocolate fix!  I made it for thanksgiving and now making 2 for chritmas parties!  I think this recipe is great just how it is I might try to add a layer of peanut butter frosting between the crust and pie, you can dress it up in any way!!

This was totally not what I expected! I wish I could have read hollymamma's review before we attempted it! I agree with her that it turned out like pudding and I was able to pour it in to the pie crust. I too questioned the directions of beating at high speed when adding chocolate mixture rather folding it in as I have always done. What a shame... my son had found this recipe online and we were making it for Thanksgiving tomorrow also.

Super easy and quick to make.  I doubled the recipe and made two pies.  Next time I will add more whipping cream.  It is a very rich pie.  Might be a little too rich for some folks.  I will make again.

This was good. I think I did something wrong, because mine didn't turn out as fluffy as the picture shown [Tricia Jaegers]. My husband thought I made pudding, he had two pieces. I had one very rich. I'll try again when it's not so hot outside, yea I'll blame the weather, not me. :)

This pie is devine.  All my family loves it.  My son-in-law requested that I "Keep it in the rotation.", and he is a real chocoholic.  It's simple and fool proof.

I used an almost identical recipe from Taste of Home's "Best of Country Pies." I didn't sift the sugar, since my recipe didn't call for that step. It called for three hours of refrigeration, but my pie got four.  It turned out great. It had a very intense chocolate flavor.

This wasn't what I thought or hoped it would be. I followed the recipe exactly, garnished with fresh whipped cream and chocolate shavings, but it just wasn't "chocolate-y" enough for me. It was super-super light instead of the rich flavor I was hoping for. Could very well be something I did but I think I'll search for a different chocolate pie recipe. Thanks for posting it, though!

I did not have success with this.  It came out like a pudding consistency.  Maybe I didn't whip the cream long enough but this was a big disappointment.

Made two of these for Mother's Day dinner.  On one I used chips and on the other I used semi-sweet baking chocolate.  For some reason the baking chocolate pie came out much smoother.  Both were very intense chocolate so our chocolate lovers were in heaven!  Would make again.

Who wants to wait 8 hrs for chocolate pie????  Once the choc. mix is melted put pan in big bowl of ice for 20 min. Then add to the whipped cream mix for about 1-2 min. Also- put in freezer for 2 hrs instead of fridge for 8. Just an awesome pie. Now do I have some patience when it comes to chocolate??? NOOOOO! enjoy

This was wonderful! Rich and silky, delicious. I'm not a fan of semi-sweet chocolate so I used milk chocolate. I was also worried with a chocolate crust it would be overkill so I used a regular pie crust topped it with cool whip and chocolate shavings and it was just perfect for me. I loved it and so did everyone at my party.

Very easy to make, easy to garnish. Really rich, but if you're like me that's not a problem. I thought it was perfect as is, but some people might want something sweeter as it's not particularly sweet. My family loved it. Thanks Holly!

Omg rich, chocolatey, and so so smooth. The chocolate crumb crust is a must in my opinion. And do let it set for the full 8hrs!! If I’m having it with dinner I make it in the late morning and it’s perfect

I have made this twice. I don’t add the confectioners sugar and it has gotten rave reviews from everyone both times. This is an insanely easy desert that can be done a day or two before a dinner party. This is on the top of my go to list of dessert recipes!

This was incredibly rich and very popular! I used a regular crust and also tipped it with fresh whipped cream

Fuffy?? No Problem! Cold whipping cream and room temperature chocolate mixture are the key.  Make your whipped cream in a cold bowl with cold beaters and cold cream for a great fluffy base to beat in the chocolate mix into. My family likes it made with milk chocolate chips.

This was very easy to make and turned out well.  I made it for some co-workers, who devoured the whole thing.   The richness of the chocolate was fabulous.  I chose to fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture instead of using a mixer to maintain the fluffiness and it worked perfectly.  I used a pre-made cookie crust because it was so much easier and less time-consuming than trying to make one.  I also recommend using a good quality semi-sweet chocolate for the best flavor.

Made this tonight and my family absolutely loves it! Did everything just like the recipe except I made my own type of crust. Very chocolatey and fluffy. I did make some home made whipped cream though to help balance out the sweetness of the chocolate. I will definitely make this again!

My husband said this was one of the best deserts I've ever made for him! The only thing I changed was I used dark chocolate chips. It definitely makes it super rich, however a generous dollop of  whipped cream on top balances it out nicely. Love how easy this is! Thanks for sharing! :)

We liked it but I used half & half instead of cream then used creamy cool whip instead of the heavy cream. Also used a graham cracker crust. Still delicious & not as fattening as the original recipe. I will definitely make this again.

The flavor was great!  It was thicker and almost drier than I expected, so I think I will try increasing the amount of heavy whipping cream a little bit next time.  Still it came very close to one I purchase at a local chocolate shop and I made this one for about a third of the cost.

Unlike most reviews, I thought it wasn't sweet enough.  I thought it was far too chocolatey to pick up the sweetness.  Needed to use Redi-Whip to sweeten it and cut back on chocolate flavor. If I made it again, I would probably use milk chocolate chips and add more heavy whipping cream.  Husband liked it but said it needed the additional whipped topping.

I made this pie for a party this week.  I used an Oreo cookie crust and substituted Frango mints (mint chocolate candies) for the semisweet chips.  It turned out amazing, and there wasn't anything left over!  Definitely a repeat.

I made the mouse part.  I thought it way  to dense and way to rich! If I where to do it again I would use 1/2 the chocolate mixture or even a 1/4 of it.  Maybe even milk chocolate.

What a great pie! I love truffles, and when I bit into a piece of this,my senses were overwhelmed by the silky melt-in-your-authentic truffle texture and flavor! My goodness--delightful! 
The ease of making it added even more to my joy! I used an Oreo cookie pre-made crust and it was together in minutes. My family ate it up! Thanks for a really wonderful recipe!!!

Very easy and delicious! Tastes exactly like a truffle, dense & intense. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup of Godiva chocolate liqueur during the microwaving of cream and chocolate chips. I let it it cool for about 45 minutes before adding vanilla and sugar and folding it into the cream. I also made the Easy Devonshire Cream from this site to go on top as another reviewer suggested. I do think it needs some kind of creamy topping/garnish to balance it out. Even my husband enjoyed it, and he is not a big chocolate person!

I started out following the recipe but ended up back at the store to buy more heavy cream.  I used a total of four cups.  There just wasn't enough volume to make it an attractive pie until I whipped up the rest of the cream and folded it into the chocolate mixture.  I've never looked at the additional photo submissions until tonight...it's obvious that other members had the same problem I did, because not a single one looked like the main photo!   Also, after reading the comment, "It was good, but not great. It tasted exactly like what it is, melted chocolate chips in whipped cream," I decided to scatter fresh blackberries over the crust to add another flavor dimension.  I garnished with blackberries and mint leaves from my garden.

I made this for the first time last weekend. I wish I had read more reviews before I did. Mine turned out like pudding as well. There seems to be something off with the recipe. There isn't nearly enough whipped cream to fold into the chocolate. The flavor is too intense for what I was looking for. Sadly, I don't think this was for me.

I've made this many times and it's awesome!  It's so easy to prepare - it just takes a few minutes. You don't expect something this easy to be so good!  I don't care for chocolate crust, so I use a baked packaged crust.   There's never a crumb left!

I made an Oreo crust by mixing 2/3 pkg crushed Oreo's and 6 Tbls melted butter.  I added 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips to the Ghirardelli  semi-sweet chips and cream.  After cooled, I added 1/3 c. Powdered sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla.  I reserved 1/2 cup of Ganache then added the rest to the whipped cream.  I then poured  the Ganache into the bottom of the homemade chocolate crust , sprinkled crushed oreos, then the whip cream/chocolate mixture.  Cooled completely. ..delicious.

This was pretty good. I wanted to make it in a springform pan, so I made my own chocolate wafer crust, which was really good and so much better than store bought, which is made with shortening rather than butter. I used the crust recipe from death by chocolate mousse and the main comment my boyfriend made was that the crust was good. For the filling I used bar chocolate, instead of chocolate chips, which is meant for melting. Bar chocolate has a higher percentage of cocoa butter, making it melt easier than chips, which have additives to help them hold their shape ( melting at a much higher temperature- which destroys the volatile flavonoids in chocolate) why they are good for cookies. I also did not beat the chocolate mixture into the whipping cream, but rather folded the whipping cream gently into chocolate, one third at a time. I  wanted the pie to be a bit higher and have a lighter layer on top (it is very rich), so I made a second, smaller layer with milk chocolate and a higher percentage of whipping cream. Not only did this add to the pie greatly, it was very pretty when cut, making two different colored layers (see my pic). I would definitely make it this way again.

I have made this pie several times, and it has always been a hit!  I do tweak one ingredient.  Instead of vanilla extract, I use orange.  It really brings out the chocolate flavor, and the tartness makes the pie seem a little less rich.

I first made this pie a few years ago and loved it. It can turn out really rich, just add less chocolate. It's my go-to dessert. I threw some semi melted  peanut butter in for my grandfather-in-laws birthday one year and it is what he requests now instead of cake. Good pie

Good as is but I did make a few changes later. I now use 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. Also, I upped the whipped cream to 1 1/4 cup. Thanks for a tasty, easy & quick recipe.

I made this recipe substituting dairy free whip topping for the real whipping cream, as my (teenage) daughter is allergic to dairy.  It was to die for!  Because it's extremely rich, next time I'll top it with cream (dairy free) to balance it out.  Superb and simple to make!

This was good, but had too much vanilla extract in it.  I believe 1 tsp. would have sufficed.  Will make again with that revision.

Tasted great, but it was extremely runny. I followed all the directions, letting the chocolate cool for several hours and adding it 1/3 at a time to the whipped cream. I let the pie chill for 12 hours. When we cut into it, the remaining filling just oozed into the empty space with the chocolate level receding like a drying lake bed. The pie disappeared quickly due to the flavor (2 stars), but did not act like a pie.

I am not a fan of chocolate cream pies, I don't really like pudding or chocolate mouse or anything like that very much, so I wanted to find something different. This looked perfect and I'm so glad I tried it. After reading most of the other reviewers, I took advice about making sure to wait for my chocolate mixture to cool completely to room temp and even give it a little longer after I thought it was ready. I noticed that many people liked the pie made with all semi-sweet chocolate chips while others preferred the milk chocolate, so I figured I should do half and half. Then I cut back on the sugar slightly and the vanilla just a tad. I also made sure to add the chocolate mixture to the heavy cream 1/3 at a time as directed. It came out heavenly. It was delicious alone but I whipped up some whipped cream for people to add if they wanted. I also put chocolate chips in top. Served it to the family at thanksgiving, everyone loved it! Even my brother who isn't the biggest chocolate fan. Perfect recipe, thanks for sharing!

Very rich, very chocolate. Adding a top layer of whipped cream or better some kind of Devonshire cream provides enough contrast to the intense chocolate flavor.

Made this for Christmas dinner dessert, oh my goodness...served with canned whip cream. Everyone raved and this wasn't the only dessert.  Was so smooth and creamy, chocolatey and decadent. I am keeping this recipe to impress. Agree, make night before, to set the flavor.

I made this for Christmas dessert and it is absolutely wonderful. I did make a few additions to the pie by adding about 1/3 cup caramel topping to the bottom of the crust and sprinkled about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans on top of that then a few grinds of sea salt over the caramel before filling the crust with the chocolate filling. It helped cut the extreme richness of the pie.

I have made this pie a few times now, and last night had to be the most challenging. My toddler wanted to "help" me and was a constant distraction AFTER I made the decision to double the recipe to make two pies. The cream:chocolate ratio was thrown off for one or both pies. One turned out very dark and more silky, the other lighter in color and fluffier... AND THEY WERE BOTH PERFECT. I took them to work for a holiday potluck and everyone thought "I meant to do that!" I have also made it with milk chocolate chips, and it's wonderful. I love this recipe.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe except added a Tbsp. of strong coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor.  I added fresh cream to the top as a garnish and it was loved by everyone at Thanksgiving.

Loved this pie!  I was very happy when there was one piece left so I could hoard it all for myself ;)
I followed some reviewer's suggestions and used half milk chocolate chips and half semi-sweet. I also waited a long time for the chocolate mixture to cool before adding in the whipped ingredients.  I did use a pre-made chocoalte cookie pie crust and the filling was the perfect amount to make it a super high pie.
After making this pie for the first time a week ago (Thansgiving) I will not be changing anything that I did.  It turned out PERFECT.

This was a very dense, awfully, rich dessert that needed to be lightened up alot. It was ganache in a pie. Won't make it again until I can figure out how to make it a little lighter.

The photo -- which I usually rely on -- didn't match the result, and I followed the recipe.  It was dense, not fluffy.  Super sweet.  Didn't love it.

4 stars for original recipe. Slightly modified by increasing amount of cream whipped to 1 cup to cut down a bit on the sweetness. Really easy to make and delicious! Drizzled some remaining melted chocolate mixture on top to decorate.

Just made this for my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it and it was the only pie that didn't make it into the leftover containers for everyone to take home.....it was already gone!  I followed the directions exactly and although it did not turn out as light and fluffy as the featured picture, it was absolutely delicious.

Amazing! Instead of heavy whipping cream, I use 2x as much cool whip, pre-prepared in the freezer isle. I find that makes it softer and less intense. Also, I put it in an oreo crust, and it is heavenly. I made this last year for thanksgiving and christmas, and I found it again to make again.

Great easy pie (less than 10 minutes). The family loved it. Made with ingredients that I usually keep around other than the crust. I may start keeping those around now!

SO yummy and So easy. Not too sweet!
I hate the microwave, so I melted the chocolate in a pot. 
I used chocolate animal crackers for the crust, and it tasted really good.
This was gone by round one of Thanksgiving dessert!

made this last night for thanksgiving dinner today... i intended to only change the semisweet chips to milk chocolate... i used ghirdelli milk chocolate chips and added 1 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips... however while i was preparing it i was not focused and was doing a bunch of things at once and realized that something went wrong when the consistency was like soup... i know it was something i did wrong... did not whip the cream enough probably... so to fix it i added a box of chocolate pudding... added it to my premade cookie crust and hoped for the best... we had a small family dinner... just four of us... three adults and a child... my father didn't eat much and didn't want any desert... but between myself, my husband and my son we finished off half of this pie already... it was amazing... i can't say if it would have been better or worse without my mishap and need to add the pudding mix to thicken it up... but regardless... it was pie heaven!

Made this today.  Was very rich.  Used chocolate chips that were 60% carob and accidently used 1/2 cup to much whipping cream.  Still it tasted wonderful.

This pie is outstanding and so easy to make. Everyone in the family loved it and that doesn't happen often. We made it as part of the 24 Days of Thanksgiving pies. Can't wait to see what pie is for tomorrow!

Wow! So easy and SO good! Made this for our Thanksgiving gathering with family and friends, and now they are requesting it for Christmas too.  I love rich foods, and even I could only eat a small piece.  Sometime I'll try it with milk chocolate, as dh prefers that to semi-sweet. He wasn't a big fan of the very dark chocolatey taste.  No problem- more for me!  ;-)

Really easy recipe that I followed almost to the t. I decided that a graham cracker crust would be better, I was afraid chocolate on chocolate would be a bit too much. I loved the rich flavor, and i think it was the perfect amount of sweet. I was happily surprised to find it was firm enough to eat after 6 hours. Everybody loved it so I will definitely be making this again!!!

I made this for a friend since she was such a huge chocolate lover. She loved it along with her family! This recipe was so easy to follow I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. Next time I will make this for my sister with the use of white chocolate chips! Awesome recipe for a chocolate craving!

OMG!  My family loved this!  But is it rich.  I put some chocolate shavings on the top for added decadence.  A huge glass of milk is the only way to chase! (HA!)  Very easy to make and well worth the wait for after a meal!

First let me inform everyone I have not baked or made any kind of dessert for maybe 12 years now. I am not big on sweets but wanted to try something different for Thanksgiving. The recipe was so easy I didn't think the pie would taste good. But it did and I am so happy.  Rich, fluffy and chocolate mmmm 5 stars in my book.

I made this pie last Thanksgiving.  At first, when I pulled it out of the fridge, it was sooooo firm that it was like biting into fudge.  The taste was rich, but odd.  As the pie sat out for a bit, and got closer to room temperature, it was absolutely AMAZING!  So, maybe let it sit out for about an hour or so before serving.  It was delicious!  Enjoy!

YUMMY! I made the cookie crumb crust from scratch and used a mini-cheesecake pan to form 12 personal servings. I pipped whipped cream on top and added a raspberry to each. It made a beautiful presentation and tasted fabulous!

For my family, this deserves the 5 star. It is easy, kid friendly, good texture and flavor. This is only for those who enjoy rich chocolate.   A sliver is enough so it can serve a lot of people.

I made this pie as individual (6) 4oz. pies.  The texture was good but didn't anyone else think that a Tablespoon of vanilla extract was way TOOO much? I will try this again but with much less vanilla. I didn't find it to be overly chocolatey.

This is SO rich.  The perfect dessert to make when you need to stretch your servings - no one can really eat more than one small piece.  It's very good and quite simple.

Delicious!  This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I used a shortbread crust which I too thought (thanks to another reviewer suggestion) would be a nice contrast. Excellent pie and incredibly simple. Thank you!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I thought the texture was great.  It does need to be kept refrigerated or it will become runny.  Will be making again for Christmas.

If you like eating semi-sweet chocolate chips straight from the bag you will like this recipe.  I am not sure what the recipe needs but my wife and I didn't care too much for this recipe and we are both chocoholics.

I'm late in posting this...  I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  It turned out perfectly... in fact, it was even better the next day (yes, I had to stash a piece in the fridge for later!).  For those of you who ended up with a pudding-like consistency, I think you should try again but be sure to allow your chocolate to cool to room temperature before mixing it into the whipped cream.

Totally delicious and a vast improvement over the pudding-style chocolate pies I've made in the past. It was the first dessert gone at Thanksgiving! Not too sweet and totally rich, just like I like it! Thanks for the big hit at dinner!

This was PHENOMENAL! So easy to make and it turned out just great! My family loved it. I will keep this pie in regular circulation throughout the year. Makes a good birthday or christmas present too!

We weren't a huge fan of this pie. I test run of it before Thanksgiving, it didn't make the cut. Maybe I would like it better with Milk chocolate chips.

This was delicious and so easy to make.  The key to making not so rich is to use regular or graham pie crust, not chocolate-based.  Also I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  This was a big hit with my family at Thanksgiving and now I have a great stand-by to bring to parties & potlucks.  Thanks so much for a delicious recipe!

What in the WORLD!!! I have made several chocolate and french silk pies from this site and this is by far the best!!  This cleared the pan faster than any of the other 10 great desserts at our Thanksgiving this year, which makes it a winner!  Thanks!!
PS. I made this again for Christmas and mixed in about 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup of frozen unsweetened raspberries (thawed and chopped).  It cut the richness and sweetness a bit and added wonderful flavor!

Complete success. I made this or Thanksgiving 09, made it the night before and it only took about 20 minutes.  I topped it with a Baily's Irish Cream whipped Cream. Add Baily's when whipping heavy whipping cream. I also added a little powered sugar to the mix.   Definitly rich and sweet, a little goes a long way.  YUMMY!!!! It was a hit and everyone went home with the recipe!

I am so excited about this.  Have made a similar pie before but with lots of butter, not heavy cream.  Will rate after Thanksgiving.  Hope it keeps well, refridgerated of course!

No one liked it except me!  I'm very disappointed and will go back to my French Silk pie I've made in the past :(

I made this last night and it was a hit! Granted, I did tweak it slightly, using unsweetened cocoa powder and a table spoon of instant coffee. But wow!

This was very easy to make!!! Five stars for that..I'll update on how it tastes after the Thanksgving feast!!!! [[Accidently used whipping cream rather than hwc.]] UPDATE:: I was not in love with this pie. Maybe it's just personal preferance, but I don't think I'll make again. Others were saying it's good but VERY rich. Absolutely. Thanks!! =)

Very good and very rich... it tasted like you were literally eating semisweet chocolate chips.  I think thats why i gave it only 4 stars instead of 5.

Not for the casual chocolate lover! Pie is very rich and needs a nice dollop of whip cream when serving. Everyone loved it (especially the kids!) Because it's so rich, I think making mini tarts as someone else suggested is a great idea.  I'll try it that way next time. This recipe is a keeper!

OOOOHHHH MYYYY!  How deliciously chocolatey..Tonight for my third helping I def will be making some homemade whipped cream(1/2 cup heavy cream with a few tbsp conf sugar-whipped up nice) to add on top.  It is great on its own but I do think it needs a little cream or vanilla ice cream on top.  SOOO GOOD and decadent.  For a true chocolate lover.  Oh..I spent extra and used ghirardelli chocolate for mine which made it so much more fabulous.

Excellent!! Easy to make, very rich.  Everytime I make it, it is raved about.  Cut small slices because of the richness.
