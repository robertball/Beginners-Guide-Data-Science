This is a family favorite, and when put on the table as an appetizer, it's always the first thing to go!  Highly recommend.

Loved it!!!! Simple ingredients, easy peasy! I could totally add an additional can of small red beans to this. My only question was to myself, do I add the gravy that the canned roast beef was packed in or not??? I added it. Because it didn't say not to. And We loved it very very much. TY

I was looking for a way to use left-over roast beef. This worked perfectly. It was together in a snap and we enjoyed it while watching a movie.

Not bad. I think it really depends on your chili.
