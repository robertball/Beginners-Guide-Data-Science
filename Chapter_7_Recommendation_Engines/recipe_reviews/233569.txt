Like another user, I also skipped the additional egg yolk. I also doubled the amount of lemon extract because I didn't think the lemon was strong enough, and added more poppyseeds and sprinkle more of sugar. But this recipe was a great starting point for me because I had never made them before :)

Muffins with a very nice texture. I didn't have the lemon extract, used lemon juice instead. To add a bit more lemon taste I brushed the top with lemon juice combined with powder sugar and that did the trick for me. Will definitely bake these again!

These muffins were good, but they tasted a little "eggy" to us.  They had a nice lemon flavor, just enough poppy seeds, and were moist and tender, all very good things.  One thing I wasn't crazy about was the size (personal preference thing) and the fact that the tops of the muffins didn't brown very nicely.  If I make again, I'll fill the muffins cups up a little more and eliminate the single egg yolk, going with just one egg.  Might even trying adding a little glaze to the top.

Absolutely loved these!!! I just made 2 modifications: I baked them for 20 minutes and used 3/4 teaspoons of lemon extract to enhance the flavor. All in all these are a great breakfast treat with a descent calorie count :)

Loved these muffins!!! We used a whole lemon for the lemon zest, and we used 1/2 teaspoon real lemon juice. The perfect amount of lemonyness!

I think my wife is addicted to these.  I make them at least once a week. This works great with orange, as well as lemon.
At first I used the recipe as written.
Now I make it twenty five percent larger, so that it makes an even dozen muffins.
I use the fresh zest of an entire orange or lemon, and the juice of said lemon or orange.
I use four teaspoon of lemon or orange extract
They are popular with everyone I have tried them on, especially the orange version.

I used Chia seeds instead of Poppy seeds and yogurt instead of sour cream. They're so delicious!

These are delicious! I went with others advice and only used the one whole egg, but went by the recipe other than that. Great flavor!

Fantastic recipe! Perfect texture, so moist. I made the mistake of reducing the sugar and the taste came out bland so I'll make sure not to do that next time

It was a good recipe, fairly simple, but next time I make it I would definitely add more lemon, the flavor did not quite come across.

These came out much more dense than I was looking for and I like more lemon flavor, these were bland. I won't make this recipe again.
