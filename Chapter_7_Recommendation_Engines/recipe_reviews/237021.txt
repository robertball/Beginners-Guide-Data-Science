This was reminiscent of rice pudding for me because of the creaminess.  I used palm sugar because I don't cook with white sugar(personal preference). 1 tsp was enough. Shredded coconut added a welcomed texture. I'll make this again. Thanks Melucy.

We LOVED this! I only used the teaspoon of sugar called for b/c I didn't want it too sweet, and that was perfect, so if you want it SWEET def add more sugar. I liked the addition of the coconut sprinkled on top, which also gave some sweetness to the rice, so keep that in mind as well if you plan on using it. I added some salt, but that was per my own preference. Oh, and I used Jasmine rice, which was wonderful in this. I would def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Amazing!  My boyfriend made this last night with caramelized baked chicken (another wonderful recipe on here). It went perfect with it! I loved the sweetness of this rice. It is the right amount of sweet. Delicious!

Fabulous! Just like in the restaurants. I used a rice cooker instead of stovetop and it turned out perfect.

I make this recipe almost weekly and our family loves it. 

I've found that in my rice cookers (one a simple 3 cup cooker which only has on/off settings and one a 5.5 c Tiger brand cooker with multiple settings) I get a better result with 2 c uncooked rice, keeping all the other ingredients the same. It's a little less mushy and the grains have a better texture.

Okay, but not a strong coconut taste.  Made this in my rice cooker. I used the stated amount of sugar. I found that if I added some sugar on my rice at the table it bought out the coconut taste more.  Not a bad recipe by any means, but I would want to play with it some more to suite our tastes.  My teen didn't like it at all.  A lot leftover.

EXCELLENT recipe - only thing I added was salt. I like sweet rice, so I used two tsp of sugar. Added the coconut just before serving and it was terrific. We served it as a side dish with BBQ brisket, steamed broccoli and a green salad. Will make it with chicken curry next time. Two thumbs up!

Delicious! I added a pinch of salt but otherwise didn't change a thing. The coconut flakes added some nice texture. I served it with fajitas that were pretty spicy and this rice added a nice cooling effect. Family loved it. Would definitely make it again!

I made my Coconut Rice last night using my rice cooker. In order to keep the same consistency as I make my regular rice, I used the measuring cup that came with the rice cooker.  My measurement is 3 cups of rice, 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup of water. Left it on low for 10 minutes after boil and it came out perfect and not mushy. Will definitely make it again.

I had coconut rice for the first time last week in a Thai restaurant. This is a perfect match. Delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe. I used brown jasmine rice in mine.

I made it but made a few changes and it was delish! Definite keeper! I doubled the recipe and instead of using two cans of coconut milk, I did one can of coconut milk and one can of coconut cream for a little more sweetness! I also added flakes while cooking and then again on top as a garnish. It came out creamy and smooth and just yummy! Itâ€™s a definite keeper! (I also made this to pair with coconut chicken, because I am a Huuuge coconut lover and it was an amazing dinner!).

I read reviews suggesting using half coconut milk and half water, so I decided to use one can of sweetened coconut milk, and one 16.9 fluid oz of coconut water with pulp.  I used two cups of short grain white rice.  It came out delicious but may be a bit sweet for some people.  It did total to 54 g of sugar for the whole pot of rice.

Not bad. I used long grain rice but I think I should try basmati next time. I also used a tablespoon of organic sugar instead and it's not bad at all.

It made a creamy tasting rice, but I prefer the coconut lime rice recipe.

It didn't have enough of a coconut flavor for my family.
