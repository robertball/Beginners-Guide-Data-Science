This was great! The only comment I would make is that, if you know you aren't going to eat all of it at once, then keep the greens separate from the chicken and the bean mixture until you are ready to eat it. Then you only have to heat up the chicken and beans. It will keep the lettuce from getting too soggy.

This recipe is very good with an excellent blend of flavors. I used romaine lettuce instead of the mixed greens and a can of regular corn. This was very quick and easy to make and enjoyed by the whole family.

Loved the addition of the cilantro to the salad greens!  I have made this several times now and we enjoy it everytime.  I top individual bowls of salad with the hot chicken & salsa mix so no leftovers go to waste.

Even my vegtable hating husband liked this salad.  We both liked that it had some flavor and spice to it, not hot spicy, but flavor spicy.

Wonderful flavors (love the cilantro and the lime!), but maybe I had the chicken mixture too hot - the greens I used (Spring Mix) wilted quickly.  I served it when we were entertaining friends, and they all said it was good, but I myself didn't like the greens so soft and wilty.  I may try it again and not heat up the chicken mixture so much - maybe just serve it on top of the greens instead of mixing it all together.  I served it with cornbread on the side - yum!

This was really good and easy to make - said 4 servings but they were huge and we had a lot left over.

Fantastic.  I use spinach leaves and cut the chicken in small pieces.  Any warm salad is expected to wilt, and it's perfect with spinach (not to mention healthy).  Big WARNING:  do not add the "remaining" fajita mix to the bean mixture, it's WAY too salty and totally overpowers the dish.  Just sprinkle the bean mixture lightly and save the rest of the seasoning packet for the next time.  You'll get great flavor this way, I promise.  My husband and I love this, my kids eat it.  I make this again and again and always enjoy the leftovers for lunch the next day (all mixed together and wilty!)  Very easy.

I loved this recipe!  I used regular corn,omitted the cilantro,and used lemon juice instead of lime.  I also used just plain spinach.  It was wonderful.  I will make it again and again.

I thought it was great; my husband...not so much.  He said it was okay for something different but he would rather have a more traditional chicken salad.

This was excellent.  I ladled the bean mixture over the greens and put the chicken on top for a very pretty presentation.

I like this a lot! I don't like cilantro at all, but I replaced it with parsley, and it was super good.

Good recipe!  I didn't mind the wilted greens, but not everyone agreed.  However, we did eat it all and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.

So yummy!  I couldn't find the mexican corn so we skipped that and didn't miss it at all!  It had so much flavor.  I added an extra skirt of lime which my husband thought was too much, but I wouldn't change a thing! I will definitely make this again!!!

I made this for Easter and got lots of compliments. I had made it a few hours earlier so it wasn't served warm, but it still tasted great. Very simple. Would definitely make this again.
