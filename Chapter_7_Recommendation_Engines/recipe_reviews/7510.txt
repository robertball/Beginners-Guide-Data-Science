I had one muffin recipe tank tonight--I was a little cautious with this one. I was worried in particular about the amount of flour/oats in relation to the amount of liquids. I omitted the oats all together and only used one cup of flour. I didn't want them to be overkill sweet either so I cut both the white and brown sugars back to 1/4 cup. I made no other changes. Even cutting back the flour and omitting the oats the batter was quite thick. I got eight muffins from one recipe and they were really small. They baked up okay but were on the dry side. I guess I'm 0/2 at this point. Darn it. I really wanted this one to work out. Guess I should have read the reviews before making this one.

A very delicious muffin. A chocoholics dream! I made it with chocolate chips though and only with 1/2 cup brown sugar (I did not add the 1/2 cup white sugar). I also added 1/2 cup white unsweetened yogurt as the batter seemed so thick that I was afraid it would stay dry. The muffins were very moist and chocolatey! Will be making them again!

WAHH WAHH! I love peanut butter and chocolate, so I thought this might be a keeper in spite of some poor reviews. I was wrong. There are many things that I think need adjusting here. First of all, the amount of leavening ie. baking soda or powder is woefully inadequate. This resulted in a small and slightly hard textured "muffin". I should have been clued into the fact that the muffin batter was the texture of a cookie dough. Too dry. Flavor was decent, but the texture needs some work.

These are the best muffins I have made yet! As a young new baker I have been making weekly muffins and I know I will be making these again! I cannot wait to share them with my family when they come into town!

These were average to below average. I followed recipe exactly. I had a group of college kids visiting for the weekend and I could barely get them to finish these muffins off. Sorry.

They are very easy to make and do taste moist. Great tasting peanut butter and chocolate taste.

This was easy and we liked them. I wouldn't say we absolutely LOVED them. I'm not sure if we'll make them again but they will get eaten!

I like these muffins a lot. I did not have quick-cooking oats and I think this might have been a mistake - the oatmeal seems harder than it should be. But the muffins are still delicious and I love the chocolate-peanut butter combo.

These had a great taste and were very moist. The only problem was that they did not rise at all!
