This was so easy and came out amazing! So moist and tender with great flavor! Thank you!  I will warn that when I first started roasting my entire kitchen smelled like soy sauce and I was apprehensive that this chicken was going to taste like soy. As the roast went on, it smelled delicious. There's a good balance to all the flavors.

Hubs fired up the smoker over the weekend and I decided to give this one a try with 6 pounds of chicken leg quarters I had in the freezer. I've learned that the smoker drys chicken out pretty quick so I like to brine. The legs turned out super moist and tender. It was a little on the sweet side so next time I'd reduce the amount of brown sugar. Easy fix. Overall good brine and one I'd make again.

I used this recipe as stated. Did not change anything. Had a 8 plus pound turkey and smoked it without any wood chips. Sooooo moist ! This is a keeper.

Great marinade. Grilled on a gas grill. Juiciest chicken I've  ever grilled. Not over flavoured  and not to salty. 
Will be a regular meal during  grilling season.

This brine combined with a bourbon brown sugar seasoning/ bbq sauce that I smoked then grilled produced the best boneless chicken thighs Iâ€™ve ever had.

It had a very distinct flavor, it made the chicken very tender and juicy. I actually put the birds on the grill!!!

Followed the directions as written using bone-in chicken breasts and they were great and very moist.  My husband absolutely loved them.
