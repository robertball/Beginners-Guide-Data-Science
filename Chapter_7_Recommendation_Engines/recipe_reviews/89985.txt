Okay, I am not one for giving bad reviews, but after I made this, I went back and re-read the whole recipe, and I didn't leave anything out.  Just a bad combination of good ingredients.  AND, when I cooked it on low for 4 hours as directed, the potatoes were not done and the barley was still crunchy.  NOT a keeper.

After reading reviews, I altered this recipe and rated it according to my alterations: I upped the liquid, barley and added some more seasonings and boullion. 1 lb extra lean ground beef (seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic & onion while cooking) 3 medium potatoes, peeled & cubed 2 cups barley 1 8 oz can tomato sauce 6 cups water 4 beef boullion cubes 1 vegetable boullion cube (or 2 more beef cubes) 2 cups sliced, frozen carrots 1 cup diced onion 2 tsp to 1 tbsp black pepper 4 bay leaves 1 tsp garlic powder cook on low 5-6 hours. stir to loosen barley and keep from sticking to sides/bottom. add 1 can cream corn 2 cans green beans taste test for salt level check potatoes, carrots, barley for tenderness. If still not fork tender, increase temp to high for 30-45 minutes. Should not need more than 7 hours. makes 6 quarts!  My 4 kids loved this, even asking for a third round! I am on Weight Watchers and not only is this filling, but very low in points!

I am making this for tonight's supper.  I started it before 7, but by noon, the potatoes still weren't done.  I also added sliced carrots, which were also not done after 4 hours.  I wasn't worried about it, though, since I didn't plan to serve it until dinner.  I didn't brown the meat first and did add some beef base for additional flavor along with the salt and pepper and a bit of Adobo seasoning and paprika.  I sampled it at lunch (minus the uncooked carrots and potatoes) and it really was good.  Oh, and I didn't have barley, so I substituted rice in the same quantity, and I used diced white onions instead of green onions.  Next time I might use pasta.  It's totally worth trying and using as a canvas for other ideas!

This is pretty good and really hearty. I did make a couple changes.  First, I used 4-6 oz sirloin steaks, cut up,
instead of ground beef. I used 3 large potatoes and I added a 6 oz. can of V8 and a bay leaf. I think it could have used a couple more of the steaks but my crock pot wouldn't hold that much.

I had to tweak this recipe A LOT! Here is what I did: 1. I used ground chuck instead of ground beef 2. I used about 1 cup of frozen whole kernel corn instead of cream corn 3. I added rice instead of barley 4. I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes, drained 5. I used 1 yellow onion, chopped 6. I used about 1 Tbsp. of dried chives 7. I added about 1 Tbsp. celery salt, 1 Tbsp. sea salt, and 2 Tbsp. seasoned salt. It still did not really taste spicy enough so I added some more pepper and seasoned salt to my bowl. All in all, it is a good recipe. Just needed a little tweaking. Thanks!

Along with the other reviewers my potatoes were not done after 5 hours of cooking.  I added some more water and cooked it on high for an hour so the potatoes would be done.  This is a good base but needs more spice and more veggies.  It was a little bland for my taste.

I was trying to throw something together with what I had around.  (Probably didn't quite use what the instructions say either...)  The result surprised me.  My mom was really excited about it, the rest of us not quite as much but it was good.

Really not very good.  Needs some extra seasonings of some kind.

This is filling but a little bland.  I will make it again but will try adding some hot pepper or horseradish.

I would not cook it again. I chose it because it was simple and sounded good.  I cut the potatoes back to 3 because it was going to be too many potatoes. In my Crock Pot, I cooked it for 4 hours on high because there was no way the potatoes would have been done. We put it on the stove for 30 minutes to finish cooking because the potatoes were still hard.  It was bland and felt like it was all one flavor. You could not distinguish individual flavors at all. It was OK, but not worth making again.
