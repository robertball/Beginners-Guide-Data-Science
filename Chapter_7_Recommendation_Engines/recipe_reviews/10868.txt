The reviews on this recipe certainly went from one extreme to the other, so I decided to try them for myself.  They're definitely not fudgy.  More like a brownie.  I followed the recipe as written, but I added a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips.  Was looking for something to sandwich homemade ice cream in between.  They worked great for that.  They are a little dry on their own.  You do need to flatten them because they do not flatten on their own.

These are the most amazing cookies ever!   They are incredibly tender and have a wonderful chocolate flavor.  I am a true chocoholic and didn't really believe a chocolate cookie without chocolate chips could be so good but boy was I wrong!  I used a small cookie scoop, covered the cookie sheet with the cookie balls and then went back and lightly flattened each one with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.  I also took some of them to work and my coworkers thought they were awesome, too!  TRY THEM NOW!!!!!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Very nice chocolate flavor, not exactly fudgy, but certainly chewy and yummy.  Make sure you watch these, though: I baked them 6 minutes and a couple of them still burned.

These cookies didn't taste like fudge, but BOY ARE THEY GOOD!  I made them for a big group because they made about 50 cookies, and they were gone that same day.  Really chocolatey, and they have that crunchy-soft feel.  I dipped them in sugar before baking...they didn't spread all that much so they're kind of small.

Not bad! These cookies turned out soft and puffy. I thought they were a little plain so next time I'll add some chocolate chips.

Incredibly easy to make. Fantasitic recipe. Substituted the bar chocolate with melted dark chocolate chips then cut the white sugar down to 3/4 cup. My nephew and his friends couldn't get enough.

Everyone in my family loves these cookies!  They became one of my favorites the first time I made them and I've made them many times since then.  They really do have the taste of old fashioned fudge.

I loved these cookies! I made a few changes though, because I like stuff really sweet! Instead of using 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate, I used 2 squares of semi-sweet chocolate.(Baker's) Also, I added 1/2 a bag of milk chocolate chips. I omitted the sugar on top because that would have been waaayyyy too sweet - even for me!

Tender-crisp texture. Be sure to watch the baking time, I took mine out after 8mins. Definitely not chocolaty in my opinion.. maybe replace some flour with cocoa powder instead?

I rolled the cookie dough into 1" balls and then rolled the balls in granulated sugar.  After baking them, I gently flattened each cookie by placing a candy kiss on top.  The combination of the chocolate kiss and the chocolate cookie was yummy!  These looked nice on my cookie tray along with the traditional Peanut Blossom cookies.  I can't wait to try this with the new mint-flavored chocolate kisses!

These are very good! I was looking a recipe to mimic some storebought cookies I tried and loved, and this is it! They were gooey right out of the oven, but then dried out pretty fast. If you want them softer, just pop them in the microwave!

These have a strong chocolate flavor but not sweet enough for us. They also seemed dry and needed something more so I glazed them. It helped but I won't make them again.

i thought that these cookies were really great, they disappeared pretty quick. i didn't have enough flour, so i substituted the last 1/2 cup with cocoa powder, and, contrary to a lot of other reviews, i didn't find them dry at all.

I was actually really disappointed with this recipe...sorry!  I followed it very carefully, but I knew as soon as I tasted the dough that these were not going to be very good.  I even rolled them in sugar before flattening to see if the taste would improve, but when they came out of the oven, the cookies were extremely dry and the texture was even a bit sandy....maybe from the rolled sugar?  Maybe using semi-sweetened chocolate would help, but I won't be trying these again.  I'll use up my chocolate calories elsewhere...

These cookies weren't that fudgy or chocolately when I first made them. so I added an extra tsp. of vanilla, and 1 tsp. of instant coffee. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and  added 1/2  c of brown sugar. I also adde an extra ounce of chocolate and a few chunks of white chocolate and nuts at the end. This became a 4 1/2 to  5 star cookie.

I was looking for a fudgy cookie that I could use with the last of the chocolate kisses. This was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly until I got to the melted chocolate, I added a 1/4 tsp mint extract. I then rolled the dough in powder sugar mixed with cocoa and baked for 7 minutes. I pressed a kiss into each one when it came out of the oven. They taste great and are a change from the peanut butter version.

I didn't have unsweetened chocolate and didn't want to run to the store, so I just used semi-sweet and it turned out REALLY good :) It was just sweet enough and and actually tasted a little "fudgier" lol

These cookies were absolutely disgusting. I made them twice. Followed the recipe exactly. They turned out realy dry and they just straight up tasted terrible.
