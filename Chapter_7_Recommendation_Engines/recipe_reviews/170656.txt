Really good and really easy! The chicken was sooooo tender. However, if you plan to cook your chicken in a slow cooker, you're going to need to shorten your cooking time if you brine.  Otherwise, the chicken will just fall apart.  I was worried that the soy sauce would overpower it but not at all. Everyone loved it and said it was their favorite so far. I cook a chicken about once a week and am always trying different recipes.  This is definitely a keeper!

I've brined a few chickens and turkeys, and before you cook it, YOU NEED TO RINSE IT. Then your bird won't be too salty.

The basis for this is good, but in my opinion whole chickens should be brined for 1-2 hours in cold water.  Longer than that and you'll take up too much salt.    Also when cooking, consider stuffing the body cavity with onions, apples, and other high moisture things and the chicken will come out super moist.

I always do my brine differently and decided to review this one and it was no where near as good as the one I already use. I always add whole peppercorns, herbs, salt, garlic, sugar, etc and no oil to a stock pot filled with water and then I bring it to a boil, let it cool in an ice bath until very cold, then add the chicken to it and leave in fridge for 24 hours, I flip the chicken after 12 hours. I always rinse my chicken before roasting, but I also add a pinch of salt, pepper, and lemon juice or chicken broth poured over the chicken in pan. I always preheat oven to 400 degrees and lower temp to 350 after putting in the chicken, and add 10-15min cooking time to make sure skin is crispy because using a brine softens the skin.

If using table salt or canning salt use half of what is called for if kosher is listed in recipe. I have unintentionally brined a whole chicken for over 24 hrs (when dinner plans changed) and it was not over salted or mushy. I also do not rinse my birds after brining and have not noticed any effects.  To make sure the salt and sugar disolve I fill a half gallon container about half full with the warmest water I can get out of the tap. Add salt and sugar, stir until disolved. Add ice to container, stir to cool water down. Strain ice if desired and fill container to bring to 1gal then add soy and other ingredients.

This is a great foundation kind of recipe. You can add your own touch. I agree with Nox,COLD is the way to go. I used brown sugar,garlic and onion powder. A few shakes of crushed red pepper, added a little kick.I will never roast another chicken, turkey etc. without brining it first.

Really good brine. Made my grilled chicken really moist and juicy without being overwhelming. NOTE: You cannot use table salt or it will be too salty. Thank you!

I have always wanted to try a recipe for "chicken brine" and this one looked easy and I had all the ingredients (or so I thought).  I placed the one gallon of warm water in a big pot and added "regular" table salt (but only half of the 3/4 cup--I only did this because of what the other reviewers stated about using regular table salt).  I thought I had kosher salt and since I did not, I had to substitute at the last second.  I added the sugar, soy sauce and olive oil and proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I allowed the whole chicken to sit in the brine for 4 hours and then I drained it, rinsed off the chicken and just placed it in a pot with a lid in the refrigerator overnight until dinner time the next evening.  The chicken stayed nice and moist even in the pot overnight.  I roasted the chicken in my rotisserie the next evening and just for an experiment I did not add anything else to the skin of the bird.  When the chicken was finished cooking, I took it out of the rotisserie and let it "sit" for 5 minutes....when I went to take off the twine that was holding the bird together in the rotisserie, the wings fell completely off and the the drumstick bones fell out with "no meat" attached...it was so completely moist and tender!!  My husband and kids were so impressed and I was so excited to say it was a brine recipe from "allrecipes".  You have to try this recipe!  I will never cook a chicken again without first "brining" it!

Nice basic brine that you can add too.  But, one step I always use was omitted... after you take it out of the brine... RINSE UNDER COLD WATER!  Gets rid of that brining salt inside and out of the bird.  Then pat dry, season, and then I put mine in a rack in the fridge to air dry for an hour.  The air dry makes for nice crispy skin.

Delicious! I would have given it five stars but it was a little too salty for our taste.  Will make again but cut back to half the salt next time.

This brine is great. Added a few addt'l seasonings for pref like cayenne, italian seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder, etc and instead of all soy sauce I did 1/2 soy and 1/2 worceshire sauce...I let the 4 lb bird marinate for 18 hrs, rubbed well with my cajun seasonings and marinate addt'l 2 hrs then roasted at 250 for 3 1/2 hrs. Skin was nice and crisp and meat was juicy & flavorful (even the white meat, smh). This may seem like a lot of steps but it is super easy and sooooo worth it. I dare you to plan a day ahead to prepare your chicken this way. If you don't like it you can always go back to the super easy, flavorless way. But if you like good tasting chicken with every bite, you won't regret this minimal effort.

I also had complaints that it was too salty.  I don't know if cutting back on the salt would help or not since soy sauce has such a high sodium content.  Sorry, not a keeper for me.

I added a onion(cut in half), crushed garlic and one bottle of beer to the recipe.  I brought the whole mixture to a boil and then let it cool in the frig. before I added the chicken.  
I cut the back bone out of the chicken, rubbed the shin with olive oil and grilled it on indirect heat until done.    The meat was tender and juicy and the shin was so crispy.  It was athe hit of the party.

I had never brined a chicken before but I'd heard people say it was a great way to cook bird. The first time I used this recipe I was hooked. I did think it was a little salty so the second time I reduced the salt to 2/3. I will never make chicken on the grill again w/o forst using this brine. It's amazing!

Perfect!!! ...this is the only way to bake or grill a whole chicken. The brine solution was so simple to mix up...I did sub garlic oil for the olive oil. And dont worry the soy sauce doesnt give it in any way an asian style taste ...I let the chicken set in the brine solution for about 5 hours and after the 5 hours I drive off the bird well and stuffed cavity with onions apple and celery ...placed in baking dish brushed skin with more garlic oil and sprinkled the skin with pepper and poultry seasoning and baked at 375 for 2 hrs .....and it was the best chicken of any kind the my and I have ever tasted....hurray for brining :-)

I added this recipe to my box on july 13th of this year and I have used it at least 10 times!  It's hard to fix chicken now without brining it with this recipe.  Love it!

I used on a 5 pound whole chicken. It really made for a tender bird, almost too tender. Next time I will leave in brine for about 4 hours instead of the 8.

I put the salt in the water first, tasting it to make sure the brine will not be too salty. Then I put in soy sauce, brown sugar, olive oil and some herbs. I then brined the chicken for 20 hours. The next day when I got home from work, I rinsed the chicken before grilling it together with some veggies to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, turning the chicken upside down mid baking. It turns out juicy and tender. Great simple recipe and technique.

You can vary the amount of salt to suit the time you have to brine the bird.  If  you want to brine it overnight, reduce the salt and soy sauce to allow for a longer brining time.  The less salty the brine, the longer the bird can stay submerged without losing texture or quality. I have brined poultry in as little as two tablespoons of kosher salt dissolved into the amount of water that it takes to cover the parts or whole bird in a zip-top gallon storage bag in the frig.  But, I do brine for several hours when the brine is less potent.

Placed a whole chicken in the brine overnight and roasted it in the oven the next day with just a little bit of pepper sprinkled on and it came out tasting great.

We scale the recipe down to "1 serving" most of the time.  It works great on chicken breasts to keep them tender before putting them on the grill.  We usually pound the chicken breasts first to make them thinner, which also helps with even cooking.  Great, simple, brine recipe, thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. The chicken was very moist and had a good flavor. I did use cold water instead of warm which diddn't seem to make a difference. Also I took it out an hour before I wanted to cook it and rinsed it off, lined it on a baking sheet, and placed it uncovered for one hour in the refrigerator. To help the skin get crispier when it baked. I also took the advice of some of the reviews and added brown suger, onion powder, garlic powder, and warchestier sauce.

I was always told to rinse chicken thoroughly after brineing or it will taste too salty.  This is a nice simple brine but I use cold tap water when mixing. No point in adding herbs and spices to brine as I will be rinsing them away before cooking.

Very good and a good brine for all kinds of meats, use it for my smoker also. One thing that very important, NEVER USE ALUMINUM TO BRINE IN or aluminum utensils.

Awesome brine! Use before I cook all my chickens in my rotisserie. I use 1/2 gallon of hottest water from tap, dissolve salt & sugar. Add ice cubes & fill to whole gallon. Add soy & olive oil & refrigerate. Rinse before I season to my taste before cooking.

Tasty and simple.  I would rinse it as suggested before. I have also used Bragg's amino acids instead of soy sauce. (It is soy based, less sodium)  It really does help keep the chicken moist when BBQ'ing!

Amazing! Afterwards I seperated the skin from the chicken with my fingers and added some garlic butter under the skin and on top. Baked at 450 for 1 hr 20 mins and pure wonder!

Awesome brine! As a very inexperienced cook, I was lookin for an easy recipe that would taste great. This one fit the bill. On my first try, I followed the directions and it resulted in a delicious, juicy chicken that had everyone going out of their way to compliment the flavor. I took a pointer from a friend to stuff the chicken with Rosemary & Garlic.

The Brine sounds awesome but as a word of caution. You should chill the brine before adding the chicken.  The temp of the chicken will rise above 42 when added to the room temp brine and it will begin to grow bacteria.  If the brine and chicken doesn't drop back below 42 degrees after an hour in the brine it has the potential to make you sick.

This is a great brine. I used it on chicken cutlets and it gave a favor that was great and juicy. Meat was also very tender. I read some of the other reviews for helpful hints. I watched my time for the meat in the brine and also rinsed the meat off and pat dry. Not salty at ALL. Good recipe and very simple

My go to recipe for a whole chicken!  I am Gluten Free- like others I sub for Braggs Aminos instead of soy sauce.  Let the brine cool in the fridge overnight & then let my chicken "soak" in it for 7 hrs. Rinse well and omg sooo yummy :) For those that say it is too salty- try only 8hrs and RINSE well ;)

Cheap!  Easy!  Delicious!  I substituted Bragg's liquid aminios for the soy sauce and then I added the juice and rind from 1 lemon.  Brined a 5 lb chicken for 2 hours and then stuffed the cavity with onions and baked it.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and super tender!  I think this recipe is a great base recipe and I'm excited about trying other variations....adding herbs, roasted or raw garlic, other citrus, etc.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Great flavor. Tried this out for my first attempt to use my new smoker. Chicken was moist, very flavorful. I kept the bird in the brine longer than directed but I was really pleased with the finished product and so did my friends and family.

Wow! It was super juicy! I brined it for 24 hours and used half the recipe for 8 chicken pieces. I added 2 smashed cloves garlic and 1/2 chopped onion to the mix then I grilled it with bbq sauce. I rinsed it several times in cold water then patted it dry before cooking and it wasn't salty.

Very juicy and tasty chicken, and not salty (and I don't rinse the chicken either).  My husband was skeptical of "that thing in the bucket in the fridge" but liked the results.  I then switched out the 3/4 c soy sauce for 1/2 c each lemon juice and apple cider vinegar and switched the oil with 1 c homemade BBQ sauce (recipe made with ACV, molasses, butter, garlic, onion and lots of spices for a kick).  Even better BBQ'd!

What a nice, simple recipe. I cut the ingredients in half, except for the salt, which I reduced a bit more. 
I marinated the skin on,bone in split breasts 2 hours. One BIG difference over prior marinading was poking my small paring knife into each breast10-12 places to help the marinade...425 on roast 35 minutes, then cooled a bit, then covered and placed in cooling oven...45 minutes ...and STILL they were tender!

This worked really well, will use it again! Once the chicken was in the oven I used the liquid to cook some soba noodles and veggies (which I then stir fried) - the soy sauce base is great for stuff like that as long as you turn the heat high enough to kill all bacteria, and then rinse with water to lessen the salt amount.  Next time I will infuse with herbs, maybe some basil.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is the best Chicken I have ever cooked!  I've heard of 'brining' but never tried it until now.  This is going to be my way of cooking poultry now.  The only changes I made were, I added some chopped garlic and tyme to the brine. Everything else the same.  Not salty at all.

I use this brine a lot for 5 lb whole chickens.  When roasting in the oven, I cook at 450 for 15 min, then at 350 for 1.5 hours.  I baste it with paprika, butter and salt mixture every 30 minutes.  Comes out so tasty and moist!  The only thing I change about the brine is lower the olive oil to about one tablespoon.  I've also used this brine for beer can chicken which is just as good.

This makes for a flavorful chicken without much effort, but it's too soy sauce-y for my taste. Next time I'll try apple cider vinegar in place of the soy sauce.

I used this with skinless drumsticks and then fried as I normally would.  My husband said it was the best I've made so far and that while it still wasn't like what his mother used to make (ARRRGGHH), he would like to have it again.  I thought it was great!

I always always use. This simple brine. I never rinse it off,have often brined for longer than 24 hours when plans changed and I use Lizzie's roasted chicken recipe (google it) on food and wine.com everyone loves all the favors. I save all the juices and pick it clean at least whats left and freeze for soup.

I brined four pounds of chicken thighs and drumsticks for an hour and half. I gave it a quick rinse,air dried the meat for a few minutes then rubbed a paste of equal parts garlic and onion powder,1/8 tsp of ground chili peppers and about 1/8 tsp nutmeg moistened with 2 tablespoons canola oil. Browned on all sides then baked in a 350 F oven for one hour,it proved very tender and flavorful,but I thought it a tad too salty. Maybe I'll rinse it more next time or else reduce the brining time for pieces to 45 mins.

Loved this brine! The soy sauce is the key. It gives the chicken a subtle flavor that you can't identify, but definitely notice. This will be my go-to brine for poultry! Thank you for posting this!

Wonderful base, leaves it open to add your own flare. Being I am a diabetic, I did however substitute the sugar for 2/3 cup of xylitol and added crushed garlic. I baked a whole chicken without anything further to see how it would turn out, I must say it was one of the juiciest tenderest chickens I had ever made. Definately a keeper. Next time I'll try it when I spark up the grill ;0)

This is a great basic brine.  I put a whole chicken in the brine before bed and let it brine over night and all the next morning.  Total brine time was about 15 hours.  I put the chicken on the smoker just after college football kicked off and a couple of hours later everybody was eating the best chicken they had ever had.  This made a very juicy and tender chicken.

By far the best brine recipe I have ever used.  I followed the directions as written and had fabulous results!  I had 5 large bone-in chicken breasts and made the brine at lunch time, and put on the grill for dinner.  Leave middle burner off and cook low and slow for one hour.  You will be very happy with the results!

Yum, Yum, Yummy!!  My kids absolutely loved this and keep asking me to make it again!  I did not have kosher salt, but used table salt but only 1/2 of what the recipe calls for and it was perfect.  Will definitely be making again!

This is so good.  I usually loosen the skin all around on a whole chicken before brining it, and then roast it rotisserie style.  The skin comes out crisp, and the chicken fall off the bone tender.

This is a really good brine. I used it on a 6 pound chicken and it made the chicken really good. I used a gallon of cold water and added some minced onions and soaked it for 4 hours. Definitely a keeper.

Good for a simple brine. Instead of having to wait until it cools down. Use less water at the start with the same ingredients. Dilute and cool at the end with ice.

Made it as the recipe said and it works fine. Only thing I changed is I left out the oil the second time I made it.
Real olive oil just coagulates and floats on the top of the brine,  a waste of  EVOO. I prefer to put the oil on the bird after I rinse off the brine and right before it goes in the oven.
I use canola oil in my marinade when it calls for olive oil, for the same reason, it doesn't harden as it gets colder.

This is so easy to do and will improve your chicken in just about any recipe.  I make the brine and let it cool while I butcher a couple large packs of chicken breasts.  Drop them in for a couple hours and then I can use what I want and freeze the rest.  Such a small step has greatly improved all my grilled and baked chicken recipes immensely.

This brine makes ALL the difference in the world to roast chicken. Even the breast meat comes out juicy and tender. I use a 2 gallon resealable bag to hold the chicken and the brine, then place it all in a large plastic bowl (in case the bag leaks) and refrigerate for 1-2 days. YUM!

I cooked a 6 lb chicken following this recipe almost exactly, and It was a huge success!  The meat was juicy and fell right off the bone, I think I might try a variation of this on a turkey for Thanksgiving using a little Worcestershire sauce as well as the soy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and made my little game hens turn out super moist and delicious. I cut the game hens in half and only left them in the brine about 3 hours, then rinsed them when they came out. They weren't too salty (and I think most things are too salty) and they grilled up perfectly.

I have used this recipe many times to marinate chicken wings and it's excellent.  I found that you can omit soy sauce and use apple juice to give chicken a little different flavor.  Good with or without BBQ sauce too.

great brine!  I have to say I have never brined before.  I have always wanted to, but always forgot.  I was making a rotisserie chicken and wanted to brine and see what a difference it made.  It sure did!  The breast meat was very juicy!  I used just enough water to cover my whole chicken in a plastic container.  I didnt get to brine the full 4 hours, only 2 1/2.  But like I said, it still made a great difference in the meat!  Thanks for your recipe!  I will use again and again!

I doubled the recipe and used it on a 12lb turkey for Christmas dinner.  My meat thermometer was off and I ended up cooking the bird for 6+ hours at 325 thinking it wasn't done yet.  This brine saved the day.  The turkey remained so moist!  Disaster averted!

Chicken came out nice. I'm mainly reviewing to mention I found the use of olive oil questionable. It made the brine slimy and gross, and I didn't notice any difference vs brines without oil. I don't think it's necessary and will leave it out in the future. But the soy sauce was a nice touch.

I added an onion, garlic and peppercorns. I also substituted liquid aminos in place of the soy sauce. Very yummy

So only thing I did do differently is use stevia instead of sugar but other than that followed recipe and it made my roasted chicken super juicy.  Definitely  a keeper  :)

Sugar is only for flavor and not a necessary part of the brining/osmosis process. If like me, you don't like using sugar, honey or other sweeteners, you can omit it from the recipe. The salt is most important, but soy sauce and other spices of choice make this a great way to prepare chicken and turkey. I've used brine for pork, as well..

I only use about 1/2 of the recipe for a whole cut up chicken.  Used dark brown sugar instead of white, added rosemary, orange peel, minced garlic, and black peppercorns.

Excellent and very easy brine!  Have made this twice now for whole chicken. Once roasted in the oven, and once cooked "beer can" style on the grill. Both were moist and delish! Added my own seasoning rub to the outside after rinsing and patting dry, and both times received many compliments. I will continue to use this brine recipe.

Great brine recipe! I used hot tap water so the salt and sugar would dissolve easier, then let it cool down & did 2 chickens overnight.  I used a 
rub for brined chicken, let sit 4 hrs and put directly on bbq, & it was moist, tender & delectable! Definitely a keeper!

I used this recipe exactly as indicated (except for doubling it.) It was perfect.  I did not wipe the chicken down as other reviewers suggested -simply because I became rushed- and it was still perfect --not too salty.  My crowd RAVED over the chicken which I had put on the grill and barbequed and finished with a homemade sauce.  I will use this brine for chicken from here on out.

I used this on both bone in chicken and boneless chicken that I was frying. Made everything nice and moist and had a wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe to a T and did rinse my meat after draining and we didn't find anything to be overly salty at all.

Excellent and easy to make and use! Followed others advice and after mixing in salt and sugar in the warm water and it was dissolved, added the chicken and lots of icecubes to keep it safe from bacteria temperatures. My chicken wasn't salty at all and I let it brine in the fridge overnight.  Also, it baked just right, not soggy  or falling apart.  Was just right! I put the 5 # chicken (covered in foil with a small opening to let out steam) in a 275*oven for 2 hours while we were at church, then when I got home turned oven to 350* and removed the foil and it was picture perfect in about 1 to 1/2 hours or so.  I reduced the amount of salt my roast chicken recipe called for since this brined all night in salt water.  FABULOUS! By the way, I used the Simply Lemon Baked Chicken from this website.  Impressive and yummy!

Great Stuff, Very tender Juicy Chicken.  I did add Ice cubes to cool the brine down quicker, just something Id seen on the Food network channel that a Chef Did.
Thank you.

Awesome recipe! Followed all ingredients, but ran out of soy sauce...so I had to add some Tamari Soy and Worcestershire to make up the difference. Tossed 4 bay leaves into the mix too. Brined for five hours. The meat was so juicy, it came out delicious! Thanks Jay :)

So incredibly simple, and the chicken was fantastically juicy. After brining, I breaded the breasts with a flax seed mixture and baked. A week later, my husband is still talking about how juicy that chicken was. Brining 2 breasts now for another recipe tonight.

Made my grilled chicken very juicy and tastey. I do agree with the others that it may have been a little too salty. Will make again but next time will cut the soy sauce by half.

I used less sugar. I added orange rind and peppercorns. I rinsed before cooking. A very significant improvement on roasting without this step. I used Mark Bittman roasting method.

Chicken was wonderfully moist and tasty.  I seasoned with garlic and herbs while cooking.
My big question is how to dispose of the brine solution - the addition of olive oil is great for the chicken but bad for my drain.  Right now I have a gallon just sitting while I figure this out.

I will never cook a whole chicken any other way from now on! I made a concoction of oil, fresh rosemary, fresh garlic, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Was afraid it was going to be too salty since I didn’t wash it after the brining, but it was perfect. Fall off the bone moist and the aroma coming out of my oven.  Could even smell a hint of the soy sauce. Mmmmm

1st time using any type of brine. This brine was quick and easy and great for a first time briner to cut my teeth on. Can’t wait to see what kind of difference it makes. I was told once you brine you will always brine.  We shall see. Thanks for the recipe. Really helpful.

I followed the measurements exactly as listed but I added some whole peppercorns and about 1tsp of herbs de Provence. I bribed my chicken for about 5 hours. I did not rinse my chicken after. I cooked my chicken rotisserie (set it and forget it) and crammed a half yellow onion (quartered) and a small apple (quartered) inside. It was delicious!! The meat throughout was flavorful and perfect.

This brine made some tender, juicy chicken breasts!  It gave the chicken a nice color and even carmelized a bit on the grill.  I’m trying it with pork chops tonight.

EZ & delicious. 
I often grapple with the "gamey" taste of chicken & brining tends to help this issue.
This simple brine made plain skinless, boneless chicken breasts flavorful & moist.  
I marinated them for 2 hours, then sauteed in grass-fed butter & avocado oil ... quick & tasty!

I made this recipe with no changes.  I had never tried brining before.  Will definitely use again.  I am always a little skeptical...would it taste the same if I used more or less of a specific ingredient?  I probably will never know the answer since my wife and I enjoyed it so much I wouldn't change a thing.  Cooked a 7 pound chicken and it was extremely moist and tender.

I prepared the chicken exactly as the recipe called, I had the chicken in the brine for 7 hours. Once cooked it was extremely moist and delicious. Everyone commented that it was the best and juiciest chicken they’ve had! I will make it again next week!!!

This is my go-to brine for chicken, especially good for keeping boneless skinless chicken breasts juicy and flavorful! 

I typically only make 1/2 to 1/3 of this recipe and I only brine the chicken for 1 hour (but i'm also using 3-4 lbs of boneless breasts or thighs rather than a whole 6-lb chicken).

Really easy and really delicious! Keeps the chicken moist. Good for anything going on the grill. My entire family using this now before grilling. I do rinse the chicken after I take it out of the brine to keep from being salty. I also brine longer without any salty effects.

Used this recipe for a party, I was making a large batch of boneless skinless Chicken Breasts.  We brined them about 2-2.5 hours.  It made the chicken much more moist!  Followed the recipe exactly, except used room temp water to start with.

Even after very thorough rinsing the saltiness of this is extreme. Literally like eating a mouthful of salt. Do not recommend this brine.

We’ve done other brines before but this one is just right. It has the correct balance of flavor that doesn’t take away from the exterior seasoning. Brining guarantees tender, juicy and flavor-full chicken on the inside.

I thought I had soy sauce but I was wrong, so I used a teriyaki marinade instead.  I spatchcocked the bird, buttered and seasoned it and roasted on convection, it was fantastic.

Great brine recipe, thank-you. I religiously brine chicken, turkey and pork but I usually just make a brine that is 1 cup iodized cooking salt to 3.785 litres of water (1 gallon for you Americans, remember that the cup I refer is a metric cup measurement, not imperial). Its always worked a charm for me  - but I thought I'd try this brine today instead and I like the different flavours it imparts on the chicken breasts that I cooked. Very nice brine - although if you want something without sugar or just something super simple, my way of 1 cup salt (not kosher, guys, normal iodized table or cooking salt) to 1 gallon water will still moisten the meat and ensure its juicy.

I used this brine for some bone in, skin on, chicken thighs. I halved the recipe, combined all ingredients in a pot, stirred until dissolved, and waited thirty minutes for the warm water to come to room temp. Put the eight chicken thighs in the brine, then into the fridge for four hours.  Then, took them out of the brine, and let drain in a strainer, and patted them dry. Husband grilled them, and added swipe or two of BBQ sauce right before he took them off the grill. Best chicken ever! Tender, and not too salty. Had the leftovers at another meal a few days later, still couldn't believe how yummy they were! This brine recipe is going to be my go to from now on!

Made this exactly as written and soaked a 5 pound chicken for 3 hours. I did use low sodium soy sauce because that is what I had on hand. Would have been good brining a little longer, not too salty. Rubbed with butter and sprinkled with garlic powder and poultry seasoning before roasting. Did not rinse before roasting at 450 for 15 minutes and then 350 for an hour. Perfect. Will make again.

I used this brine on whole chickens that my husband smoked. I was only able to brine the chicken for about 4 hours. My husband smoked the chicken for about 3 hours. This was hands down, the best chicken I've ever eaten in my life! The flavor was amazing and the chicken was incredibly juicy. I will forever use this brine recipe and will pass it on to my friends and family!

I used this recipe to brine a 13.5 lb. turkey.  It wasn't for a special occasion, it was just for myself for a good, lean protein source.  I'm not normally a huge fan of turkey, but I cooked it on a Sunday afternoon, and by the time I finished dinner Wednesday night, all that was left was one leg.  It was the tastiest, juiciest turkey I have ever eaten- sorry grandma!

I really like this recipe. It was simple enough that I had all the stuff in my cabinet. I did add some black pepper corns and garlic to the brine. The chicken was juicy and had a good taste once cooked.

After putting chicken in the brine, we put them on the grill. They turned out moist and juicy!  They were the best! I know I will use this recipe every time we grill breasts!

Used this recipe for 3kg wings and it was great.4 - 4.5 hr soak, combined with a seasoned dredge and fried .. the finished wings were great without any additional sauces!

I made the brine with only a few additional spices, it seemed to call for handful of peppercorns and couple of star anise and some crushed garlic.  It smelled lovely but unles you are going to brine 2 chickens or a turkey there was way to much. I now have  couple of pint bottles in the freezer, if I just want brine small amount of whatever meat. The first chicken I skinned out of habit, as you get lovely stock if you cook your whole skinned chicken in the pressure cooker.  So in it went and in the fridge. For 24 hours. Then to roast, had to cover because of course no skin. Came out lovely and juicy. And since I am of the waste not want not variety, I had some chicken pieces that I stuffed into that pot and put in the fridge. Once cooked, these also came out very tasty. With the pieces I only trimmed of the excess fat and left the skin on. The brine is still good and currently brining away another batch. Also It's a good way to stop your chicken  from going off, if you get caught up with other things and don't have time to cook it next day. It will be good for another 2-3 days .
And the flavour can be changed up  by rubbing  seasoning rub of choice on before popping  in the roasting pan.  
So overall success. Only now that I am more sure of the quantity  I will do half of it in the future. US measures are a little scary.

Recipe works well.  FYI: There is no such thing as "kosher salt."  All salt is kosher.  There is however "koshering salt" for drawing the blood out of animals being prepared in the kosher manner, but it's the same as regular salt.

Agree with most posts about to much salt, cut it down to half cup, I brined for full 24 hours with a chicken from my farm ( no fat) but was still very very juicy and moist. A little left over flavour from the soy but almost non existent. Only put butter and pepper to season.

The only thing I did differently was leave it in the brine an extra day and only because I didn't have time to cook.
My husband asked me to make it again.

I thought 6 hrs on a 4lb chicken wouldn't be long enough in the brine but the meat was perfect. I put my chicken on the rotisserie for 2 hrs and could see the juices boiling under the skin. However the skin was not crispy should have left on longer .

This recipe works like a champ!!!  Do not change anything....there is no reason too.  Now after brining  ....you decide to cook in a crock-pot.......get ready for a treat.  Most tender and juicy chicken you may ever eat in your life!

Wow-I had low expectation but this was great!
Now at the last minute I decided to throw in garlic powder and some black pepper into the brine but otherwise I followed the ingredients/amounts. Also, 
I heated a small amount of the water to dissolve the sugar/salt, added the pepper and garlic powder, and then added the cold water (I didn't want to put the raw chicken in warm water...)
I only brined for 5 hrs, did not rinse, roasted @ 350 F til 180 degrees.
Perfectly seasoned-not too salty IMO
THANKS-this is definitely a keeper and so so easy to make, with ingredients everyone would have on-hand.

Yum! I added oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder to the brine and then let the chicken sit for 36 hours. We like our food well seasoned and the extra hours made a difference. After taking it out of the fridge, I rinsed the chicken and patted it dry. then I placed it back in the fridge to let it air dry. This made the skin nice and crispy. Before putting it in the oven, I rubbed the chicken with oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. I stuffed it with onions. I baked for about 90 minutes at 400. It came out delicious! My husband loved it. If I do it again, the only thing I'd change is cooking it for longer at a lower temperature. I didn't experience the meat falling off the bone as others did.

I've made this a few times, actually. I really was surprised that with kosher salt, my chicken doesn't taste salty. It doesn't.  If I brine a whole chicken, I put it in my tabletop rotisserie.  Yummmm. I usually sprinkle it inside and out with lemon pepper before cooking. You won't be disappointed,  in my opinion. My sis says, and she's right, that this is a good base to add to. She suggested fruit or fruit juice. But cautioned against leaving it in the brine too long with those. Thanks for this recipe, Jay!

Great brine. I use it all the time now. Flavorful but not overpowering. Make sure you don't use table salt. Use canning or kosher salt. I use cold water though. Everything still dissolves fine. I just don't want to warm up poultry before putting it in my cooler.

This was my first time using a brine, my chicken turned out great!  Nice and juicy!  I used lite soy sauce. I was a little worried about the soy sauce making it salty, but it wasn't salty at all. After roasting the skin was nice and crispy and I didn't let it sit in the fridge for 1 hour like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I will definitely use this again.

I have only recently started making a brine for turkey and chicken. This recipe was simple but it turned out great (better than the complicated turkey brine I made). I used table salt (did not see the other reviews before making the brine and I adjusted the recipe for a serving for four) and added fresh ground pepper. I let the chicken sit in the brine for four hours, rinsed it (as I was afraid it would be too salty - thank you for the review stating to do this!), and then barbecued it. It was delicious and juicy. I also added  ice to cool the brine before immersing the chicken. I will definitely use this as a base for any brine in the future.

I have used this recipe as a base several times now and am not sure why so many think it is overly salty. I have never rinsed my chicken after brining for 2-5 hours before grilling and it does not overwhelm me with salt sat all. I do often use a mixture of ponzu and soy b/c I like the citrus flavor but that does not really reduce the salt amounts. Maybe the salt is more pronounced when the meat is roasted as opposed to grilled?

I have used this recipe for a couple of years...and I add crushed garlic and a bit of hot Serrano peppers.  I buy organic free range chickens and this brine makes them juicy and tender.
