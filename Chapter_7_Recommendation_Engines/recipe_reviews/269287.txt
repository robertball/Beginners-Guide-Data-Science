Love the use of kale instead of the usual romaine. This is very tangy/lemony, but I enjoyed it. When I first tried the dressing on its own, I didn't love it, however once mixed into the kale it's quite tasty!  It could probably use a few more anchovies (you really don't taste them at all) and a bit more salt.  I also massaged the kale with a sprinkle of salt before pouring the dressing on - this helps the kale soften up a bit and not be so tough to chew. Looking forward to making it again!
