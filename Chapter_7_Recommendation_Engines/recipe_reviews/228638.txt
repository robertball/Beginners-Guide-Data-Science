The interesting thing about this soup was that the taste kept changing so significantly across every step.  Was very very pleasantly surprised with the flavor after adding the cream.  And, indeed, add the bacon because it makes the soup!!

I'm usually a disaster in the kitchen but this was a no brainer & it came out perfect & delicious. I used philamom's advice to use a hand-held blender, great tip!  I also went to Whole Foods & got two 20oz.each packages of peeled & cubed butternut squash, it makes 10 servings in this recipe.  I used crystallized gourmet honey (I used "Miele d'Fleur", a product of Spain) & didn't puree completely...the flavor & texture were incredible! Now, it's a bit heavy so next time I'd go a little easier on the cream but all in all, such a fantastic recipe!

Two things kept me from giving this recipe 5 stars: It was too salty, and the chicken stock should have been added in two parts. 1) I'm the salt queen. I put extra salt on everything! So when I say "too salty," believe it! Next time I make this, I'll put 1 TEASPOON to start, then let others add what they want at serving time. 2) Adding 32 ounces of chicken stock before blending made for a dangerous situation. Even trying to hold down the top of the blender as instructed, the top shot off and hot soup flew everywhere (including on my hand)! If you have a handheld blender, use that to blend right in the pot. That worked really well for me. If you don't have a handheld, I would add about two cups of stock when cooking the squash/onion mixture, put that mixture into the blender when cooked, and add the rest of the chicken stock after you pour it back into the pot. Then simmer for a few more minutes before adding the cream. Keeping these two problems in mind, I will make this again! It really was delicious.

This was very yummy soup! I bought a package of peeled butternut squash cut into large chunks from Trader Joes. I highly recommend it, to save time. However, I realized it was only 1lb 2oz, so I made 1/3 of the recipe. I added about 3-4 minutes onto the simmering time once I added the broth as they were big pieces. I then put it all in Vitamix blender and blended it on high about 3-4 additional minutes. Only change was I didn't have heavy cream so, I used 2% milk and 1 Tblsp of butter. It worked fine for last minute. This is very much like the butternut squash from the nice restaurants, except I liked that it was not loaded with cream and butter, and I know what went into it. I got 3 servings with 1/3 of the recipe, which was fine for dinner tonight. TY!

Super smooth and satisfying.  I added 2 cloves roasted garlic just after cooking the onion.  With or without the garlic this is a beautiful, luxurious winter soup!

This was so easy and sooo good! I used Agave (2Tbls) instead of honey and I think that was the secret ingredient. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken...and skipped the cream. Truly was rich and creamy without it!
This is going to be a Fall/Winter staple.

I've been on a soup-making kick all winter and this is tops! I made it exactly per the recipe except for substituting vegetable broth, as I'm a vegetarian. It has just a delicious combination of sweet and savory taste--nice complex flavors.   It's not easy to make, what with all the squash chopping, but I'm afraid there's no getting out of making this again.

Absolutely delicious. I've made it several times -- the first time, I followed the recipe exactly and my family thought it was a bit too salty and had too much of a kick, so I reduced the white pepper to 3/4t and salt to 2t and now it's perfect for us. I use evaporated whole milk instead of cream (saves $$ and calories). I don't garnish with bacon or croutons, but I do sprinkle it with freshly grated nutmeg just before serving. This was the hit of our Thanksgiving table!

Delicious! Bought precut squash at Trader Joe's which made this very easy.Also used low sodium chicken broth to alleviate the to salty comments. Used less salt then a tablespoon.Added a pinch of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.Tasted as good as any restaurant preparation.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  Wow!  Unbelievably delicious!  I followed the recipe except that I added a pinch of cinnamon -- just a pinch.  While I love white pepper, I was surprised to see it in the ingredient list for this soup because it's got such a unique flavor, one that definitely does not belong in this recipe. I opted for freshly cracked black pepper.  I shared some of this soup with some coworkers and everyone asked for the recipe.  10 stars!!

Very yummy! I tried roasting the squash in the oven for 30 minutes, then mashing it and adding it to the caramelized onions and proceeding from there. A bit salty for us, so I'd half the salt and add more to taste. Otherwise, very good!

This is probably my favorite butternut squash recipe so far. I frequently skip browning the squash in the pot and instead cut the squash in half, butter it and cook it on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes to make it easier to peel. My favorite variation to try is adding chopped pears. Using two bartletts add a great sweetness and depth. I haven't noticed the saltiness problem other people have mentioned, but I always use unsalted chicken stock in my cooking. Also, since I hate measuring honey, I usually give my bear around 20 quick squeezes. That seems to do the trick.

YUM!  i vegan-ized this (meaning NO animal ingredients at all) by using vegetable stock & soy creamer, instead of real cream.  holy yum, it's rich, peppery, slightly sweet...i'm not even hungry but can't get enough "samples," ahem...trying to save the rest for the week as i intended to do :)

Although it got rave reviews at my party, I'm my own worst critic.  I think I may have added an extra tablespoon of oil because it seemed it needed it to brown the squash.  I would definitely not do that again as I felt it had a tad bit of oiliness to the consistency.  Adding the half & half (what I used) made the world of difference.  I usually prefer savory to sweet with squash recipes so wanted to add thyme but it was too late in the process.  I'll try that next time.  Buying already cut squash (at Trader Joe's) is a huge lifesaver.  I would never buy another whole squash again and attempt this.  I used pre-chopped onions too but felt they really affected the flavor profile.  Although very convenient (and mascara-saving), there's no substitute for a freshly diced onion.  Enjoy!

Great. I actually used pumpkin as well as the butternut squash and roasted it in the oven.  I froze it to take to the mountains this weekend and will have it in front of a roaring fire. It was very thick so I added more broth than it called for but the flavor was yummy!!!

This was pretty tasty. Getting pre-cubed butternut squash will make this a really easy recipe. It's already pretty simple. Suggestions for improvement: use an immersion blender instead of a regular one. I like to leave some chunks in there for texture. Add a bit of cinnamon and a bit of cayenne red pepper (it gives it depth not heat). This would definitely be better with some bacon chunks on top or blended in. Overall, great basic recipe!

This is one of our favorite winter soups.  It is wonderful as is.  I use an immersion blender instead of transferring the soup to a blender but, otherwise, I've made this according to the recipe & have been very pleased with the results.  If you are looking for a delicious recipe that is very easy to make-this is it!

This has become my favorite fall soup!! I make it exactly as written. Delicious served with crumbled bacon and roasted pumpkin seeds. Here’s a tip for cutting the squash: prick with a fork in several places and microwave for around 3-4 minutes. Let cool. It will be MUCH easier to peel and cut.

It's pretty good. I added a bit less squash and it is "soupier" and not as thick. I think next time I'll use a full 4 pound butternut squash because after it is cut up you only have about 3 pounds. I also opted for regular black pepper corns because white pepper gives too much kick. I also gassed an extra tablespoon of butter for a note "nutty" flavor. All in all not bad.

Loved the soup so creamy and tasty. The only change I made was to cut the honey in half as I find butternut squash soups can be a little to sweet. Very simple to make. Bought the squash pre cut. Will definitely make again.

I liked this soup much more than variations which call for roasting the squash.  I cut down the fat by omitting the butter and using light instead of heavy cream.  I used an immersion blender which is quickly becoming my favorite kitchen tool!

Very good, though I didn't use the cream, too many calories; I pealed and chopped 3 small potatoes and let them cook with the squash, once blended it has a very creamy texture. Used garlic black pepper as no white in house.

My daughter made this for us one evening when we were over for dinner.  She followed the recipe exactly except for using Trader Joe’s flower pepper instead of the white.  It was seriously one of the most delicious soups I’ve ever had!  What amazing flavor!  The caramelization of the squash and onion adds such a depth of flavor, both savory and sweet.  We couldn’t stop eating it!  I have several butternut squash plants in the garden right now and come fall this recipe is going to be happening every week at our house!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Don't love onions? Try this teensy edit! 

This is the most amazing recipe, and my go-to for making soups! Made it for my husband's family for Christmas and they loved it! I pretty much eyeball everything in the kitchen, so I don't know if I edited the quantities of the recipe a bit.. usually just do it to taste. As far as stock goes, I use 3 cups of broth and a stock pot and if I need more broth, pour it in to taste.

Only changes: I HATE onions unless I can't taste them (don't mind the flavour of the caramelised onions, but still can't eat them plain, so when I make this, I always do the onions separately with a little brown sugar, some olive oil and balsamic vinegar (or raspberry wine or some other sweetish vinegar) until they are pretty mushy. After it's cooked, I put the onion in the food processor so I can't distinguish any onion texture. Taking this extra step to pan-caramelise and puree makes a huge difference and I think adds a fantastic touch for those who find onions too strong. 

Then I cook the squash, which I find take more than 5 minutes every time (maybe I have my cubes too big?) and add the onions in when the squash is done. 

I think I used the amount of cream the recipe called for, but as I said, I eyeball and do to taste. 
Didn't have any white pepper on hand, just used regular, so I can't say anything on that front.

SO, SO GOOD!

Loved this - the hardest part was peeling the butternut squash. The rest was a total breeze and it came out absolutely perfect. A little sweet and a little savory. I definitely recommend this - even if you aren't an onion fan.

I had never used white pepper before, but-oh my goodness-that is a powerfully unique flavor (not in a good way, to my tastes). My soup had to be completely altered to try to compensate and I only used 1/2 tsp of the white pepper to start. I had to add lemon, cinnamon, cumin, red pepper flakes (everything but the kitchen sink). It ended up great but I would definitely not follow this recipe again.  Also agree with previous reviews--start with only 2 cups of stock.

Loved it! Watching calories so skipped the butter and sour cream but did add the honey.  Also added 4 carrots which took a little longer to soften enough to run it through food processor.  Added cinnamon as well.  Delicious!

This was a great change from the normal sweet soups using butternut squash. Followed it as written, but did use half and half I had on hand. The soup had a deep flavor from the caramelized process. Topped with some bacon.

Great recipe!  The only changes I recommend are to use half the amount of white pepper listed (a little spicy for my taste) and add a few chopped sage leaves, a teaspoon minced garlic, and a teaspoon freshly grated ginger while the squash is cooking.  *Use an immersion (stick) blender-they are inexpensive and used right in the pot to lessen the time.  A great one-pot soup that can be done easily in a large cast iron ceramic pot and makes a generous portion. *Also save time by purchasing the pre-cut and peeled squash from  the supermarket. Easily made in about 2 hours or less.

I followed the recipe and added 1/2 lb chopped carrots with the squash in the pot and then 1 chopped Serrano pepper including seeds with the onion into the pot. What can I say, I love spicy. An immersion blender would be helpful but I don’t have one. Instead I poured the mixture by parts into the blender and repeated this process until it was to a smooth but not quite silky consistency. I prefer this type of soup to be thicker but it would be easy to thin it by adding more stock.

BUY THE READY CUT SQUASH! Never again for the whole vegetable for me! I am 72 and wrists don’t work as well for heavy cutting tasks. I used much less salt than this calls for and adjusted from there. I used vegetable broth (I no longer use any chicken broth and I am not a vegetarian) and some half and half instead of heavy cream. This is a really delicious soup. Butternut and acorn squashes make a nice combo! However, I am sure any squash will work well in this dish!

I've tested about 5 butternut squash soup recipes and this is the winner! It's so rich and doesn't have sweet potatoes and carrots to ruin the butternut squash flavor. This is the only recipe I use now.

Really yummy! I didn't add the honey because I thought it was sweet enough without it.  I also blended in 8 oz cream cheese to make it thicker and creamier.

I was trying to make a smaller amount so I needed to probably use less onion than I did and use more nutmeg. Maybe add a touch of cinnamon

Oh, my gosh.  I made this for Christmas dinner, and added 3 strips of bacon.  It was the most amazing dish I have almost ever served.  My family went nuts!  I should have at least doubled it, or even tripled it.  I followed the directions exactly with the addition of bacon, and had to add more broth at the end.  While it was cooking my family was raving over the aroma from the kitchen!  In preparation, I used a stick blender instead of transferring it to a blender, and I think that is safer and keeps it warm better.  I will be making this regularly.

Made as is, but reduced to 8 servings.  To make it thickness in pix, I would decrease the stock amount.  Also make sure the onions are really soft - otherwise they will be in the soup in pieces -- otherwise... hmmm

Wonderful flavor, color and aroma. I substituted brown sugar for honey. I also used half and half and would suggest to taste before adding to much to avoid making to rich for your taste.

Easy to make and delicious!!  The second time I made this, I cooked the squash on the oven for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees to make peeling it easier.  My husband and I both really enjoy this soup.

This was my first attempt at butternut squash soup.  I had just made some beef bone broth so I used that and did it ever turn out great, it passed my mother in law's test!  I added some fresh thyme, but kept the recipe as written.

I made this for the first time tonight. In cooking over the years, I have learned the hard way that "it's easier to add more spice later than to take some out if it's too much," so I tend to tweak spices as I go. I think this approach saved my soup with dinner guests coming tonight. As I was preparing it, I made several on the fly revisions that I think put this soup over the top for us: 1) 1 TBSP of salt sounds like a lot (most recipes call for 1 tsp or less), so I cut it down to 1 1/2 tsp, planning to add more at the end if needed. I'm so glad I did! Any more than that, and it would have been too salty. 2) We do not do super spicy in our family (my husband has a bit of a sensitivity to pepper), so I knew 1 whole tsp  of pepper would be too much for us. I cut it to 1/2 tsp, and again, am so glad I did. That was almost too much. I think I may try dropping that even more to 1/4 tsp next time, and allow people to add more at the table to individual taste. 3) I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and upped the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp as well. This was perfect. 4) It was not quite sweet enough for me on first taste test, so I added about 1 TBSP more of honey. That was also perfect. 5) We had a vegetarian coming to dinner, so I subbed the chicken broth for vegetable broth. I think either type of broth would produce equal delicious results, so use vegetable broth if you wish. Made this way, and following the recipe exactly otherwise, got rave reviews from my dinner guests and my husband (who did not

So delicious! The best I've ever had outside of a restaurant and better than most I've had in  restaurants. I even had it for breakfast a couple of mornings. It will definitely become a standard in the house. The only change I made was that I added the bacon fat to the soup,  something I never do but I guess I was channeling my mother!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  If you are not use to peeling or working with butternut squash, be patient.  I find it easier to cut in half, next cut in wide strips then peel the strips before dicing.  I like it better than buying pre-cut squash, especially if you grow it.  This soup tastes better than Panera's and they are pretty hard to beat.  Makes  a lot so plan another meal around left overs.

As other reviewers suggested, cream was not needed.   An immersion blender was effective and much safer than trying to pour hot liquid in a blender.  Delicious, even the next day.

I took out the cream and added an apple for healthy choice alternative. Cream will change the texture of this soup and add flavor. Overall good choice.

If I had had more squash, would have followed receipe exactly. Since I only had a bit more that 1 lb, I cut the receipe.  Used chicken stock. Garnished with crumbled bacon that was cooked in the broiler ( like the Seasons 52 gave us) Yummy.

Way too salty! For most of my cooking, I use Better Than Boullion rather than broth, and this time was no exception. Next time I'll keep the amount of water the same and reduce the amount of BTB that I use; I'll also eliminate the 1 tablespoon of salt called for in the recipe.

Otherwise, I think caramelizing the squash and onions adds a depth to the flavor that other recipes lack. Honestly, though, it was really hard to tell anything about the flavor past the saltiness.

I have made this soup many times and everyone that has tried it has loved it.  I always cook and chop up some bacon and put croutons  on the side for anyone that wants to add them to the soup.  I always add both to my bowl as I really like the little extra flavor and texture it provides.  

Side note is make sure that your ratio of squash to broth is right.  To little squash and too much broth makes it too soupy but too much squash and not enough broth makes it too thick.

I also added 3 tbsp of cream cheese, and I've got to say, it's the creamiest soup I've had ever had! And it stays true to the squash flavor!

I loooove this soup. I make it a few times every fall. I use slightly less honey because I find it a bit too sweet. Add toasted coconut flakes on top of each bowl to add woody notes!

An absolutely delicious, flavorful soup.  I used fat free half and half but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Using an immersion blender right in the pot made the blending process  easy.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Way too salty. Used vegetable broth because of allergies, and used one less cup of broth to keep it from being too thin.

Tasted it without the cream and it wasn't too bad. But if you want that decadent rich soup then I would add it. The cream also gives it that little bit of sweet richness. I ended up adding almost a full cup. Also added more nutmeg as well as cinnamon. Ate it with some fresh artisan bread.....YUM!

Delicious!  As other reviewers commented, no cream required, although I'm sure a little cream couldn't hurt!  I added 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, because I like a bit of heat, but it was delicious without it also. Thank you for posting. This is now officially my favorite butternut  soup recipe,

I really liked this soup!  I cooked the butternut squash overnight in the crock pot, so it was soft when I started.   I went ahead and sauteed it in the oil, then followed the rest of the recipe (except I think I used 5 cups of stock in stead of 4 because I wasn't paying attention!).  Next time, I think I will saute the onions alone until they are very soft and sweet, and then added the cooked squash and other ingredients.  Very good flavor and will make again!  Oh...and I only used 1 teaspoon of salt....I knew 1 T would be toooooo much!

I make this soup all the time in the cooler months! It is my absolute favorite. When I put the soup into the food processor I don't totally puree it because my husband likes the consistency to be a little chunky.

I love this recipe! Its always a hit and easy to make. I carmelize the onions before adding the squash and I add a bit of cinnamon when I add the squash. Be careful not to add too much, if you do the soup will taste like a desert.

This was so delicious--best squash soup I've ever tasted. My only changes were cutting way down on the salt and replacing the stock with water and a bit of vegetarian soup base powder.

Very creamy on its own, but the whipping cream adds a degree of richness. I also would recommend adding a small amount of lemon juice for some zest.  I used vegetable stock instead and it turned out great.

This is great! I made the mistake of making it in a cast-iron dutch oven though, and the soup turned a light brown color- not attractive!  Added silken tofu instead of cream to add protein.  I usually like apple in my butternut soup as well, and it would've been a nice addition- next time I will add some.

I loved this recipe, and it was a hit with my fussy teenage daughter! As someone else mentioned cutting up the butternut squash was the hardest part, otherwise very easy to make. I also reduced the amount of cream used and anyone making it should be aware, the white pepper has quite a kick! If your not into spicy food reduce the pepper somewhat but otherwise a fantastic recipe

I cut down the cream cheese and added 1 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2. Instead of sautéing the onions, I cut into quarters, cut the butternut into a little bit bigger sized pieces, drizzled both with olive oil and spices, and roast in 425 oven for 40 mins. After which, I cooled, puréed and added to soup pan.  I also added 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to the soup while cooking.  Perfect!

This was FANTASTIC. I made it for my parents as a Sunday lunch, paired with a baked pork tenderloin. The only part that took any time was peeling and cubing the butternut squash, which I had never worked with before this recipe. I didn't add more white pepper than the 1 tsp, because it can get a little overpowering. Definitely a new family favorite- and SO inexpensive! It makes a LOT and is very filling.

Loved loved loved it! Bought the squash pre-cut from the grocery store which made life so much easier! It took longer than 10 minutes to brown the squash, just a heads up. Next time I will reduce the honey and switch out the heavy cream for milk.  We topped it with some crispy bacon and it was perfect.

This was the best butternut squash recipe I have ever made.  It didn't even need the cream at the end!  A Keeper!

This was delicious!! I didn't have white pepper or heavy whipping cream. I used black pepper and thickened some milk instead. Husband is not a huge soup fan, but he loved it!!!!!!!!!!!

Really good! We cut serving size to 4, but only had enough for two people...so make the full batch. :) a bit salty for our taste--I'd add less next time.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this soup.  It was delicious and relatively easy to prepare.  I will definitely be making this again, as even my 3 year olds enjoyed it.
