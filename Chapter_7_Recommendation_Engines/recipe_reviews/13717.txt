I am not too big on veggies, but I CRAVE this dish!!!  First, FRESH, steamed grean beans are key!  I reduce the sour cream to 3/4c as others have suggested, reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp, add black pepper, and 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder with the salt & sugar. I use a large can of french fried onions and mix 1/4-1/2 can into beans, the rest I crush with the cracker topping and extra melted butter.  I add extra cheese (like most cheesy recipes I use), and mix some into the beans.    This can be mixed together ahead of time then thrown in the oven 30 minutes before serving.

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I made it as printed.  The onions were crunchy and raw, it was salty, and the flour made it too thick.  I tried it again, incorporating suggestions from previous reviewers.  I sauteed the onion in the butter until tender and translucent, and I reduced the salt and the flour by half, and added half of the cheese into the beans mixture.  It was much better the 2nd time!

I LOVED this and so did my entire family. Just perfect, thank you!

To a previous reviewer (Rose): Shame on you for leaving such a low rating after changing almost the entire recipe. Raters like you drive me crazy.

Absolutely Amazing!  I made this for Christmas exactly as the recipe is written, as I always try to do first, and then I made this again today, as a request by my husband for his regional meeting luncheon.  The first time was really great with simple go to ingredients, but the second time with a little extra energy and personal preferences added....was to die for.  The serving dish at the luncheon was all but licked clean.  My husband even found one of his crew scraping the serving spoon to ensure all that was to be had was had!  Too funny.  The second time I made some minor changes.  I used approximately 2 lbs fresh green beans which I steamed just shy of perfect since they were going in the oven as well, I used two 8oz blocks of Cabot (absolute hands down best cheese ever) seriously sharp cheddar (whatever reviewer said there was too much cheese would not be able to survive living at my house!) mixing about 4 oz into the beans, I minced my onion so there would be no large bites in my finished casserole, I added several turns of course ground black pepper, added about 1/2-1 t of garlic powder and finally used the French's Onions at my husband's request.  The casserole was loved by all and I was finally not the one taking food home from a covered dish!  Thank you so much Amy this is my new go to favorite for holidays AND covered dishes!

This was good, but I think my green bean casserole taste better.  They are very close, but you need to saute onions in butter until soft add flour, salt sugar and dash of pepper. Remove from heat add sour cream.  Spread over green beans and top with swiss cheese. Bake until cheese melts.

Had such HIGH HOPES for this recipe based on the sheer amount of reviews, but my family seriously disliked this dish..... Have to give it 1 star as I tended to agree with them after two preparations.

The recipe would be fine as is, but it's superb if you saute onions in butter first. When I make this recipe, I use fresh green beans from my farmer's market. I steam them first, using chicken broth instead of plain water. While they are steaming, I cook the onions in butter until transluscent, then add the flour, sugar, salt & pepper, cook 1 minute, then turn off heat. Then add sour cream and 1/2 the cheese in the saute pan. Pour this mixture over the beans in the casserole dish, add the other 1/2 cheese, then the crackers & butter. I could eat the whole thing myself, it's so delicious.

My family and I liked this recipe much better than the ones with cream of mushroom soup.  The only suggestion I have is to mix the cheese in with the green beans, otherwise it makes a crust on top that is hard to cut.

Excellent! Four stars because there is so much cheese.  We love cheese as much as much as the next person; however, this is way to much. If you are a moderate cheesse person and concerned with fat, use 1 cup, the taste will still be there. If you are a cheese lover, use 1 1/2 cups, that should be more than enough.

This recipe is a great alternative to the classic green been casserole with the fried onions.  I first made this last year for a family dinner and it got rave reviews.  I knew it was REALLY good when over the past year it was requested frequently.  I wouldn't change a thing, just be sure you use the CANNED FRENCH STYLE green beans.

I keep forgetting to make these and oh yes...this is by far the best green bean casserole ever. My husband said it's way better than using cream of mushroom. I  read other reviews before hand and this is what I gathered: sauteed the onions (I always use red onions) with the butter first until translucent, cut back on the salt by half, 1.5 T. of flour, half cup of cheese mixed with the green bean, spread 3/4-1 cup cheese then sprinkled a tad bit of the crushed cracker and finished off with French's fried onions (add some during baking and add more after).

This is a great recipe!!  I added more onions, cheese and some garlic and onion powder into the mixture.  Then I added more cheese on top.

FANTASTIC! I believe a good or creative cook never needs to use cream-of-anything soup to make a great dish! I am so happy this does not use cream of mushroom soup (or yucky canned onions - OOF)! I made three minor changes: I used seasoned bread crumbs on top instead of crackers, I put just enough cheese on top to cover the casserole, and I lightly cooked the onions before adding to the dish (just lightly because we like onions and the crunch they give!). I also doubled the recipe. It's great!!! I used canned green beans (would be wonderful with fresh also) and they were just fine even for a holiday dinner. This is a great recipe as is, but I do prefer the seasoned bread crumbs to crackers. Please don't alter any other ingredients! Try it first with ALL of the sour cream and sugar! If you love this type of casserole, then you won't be disappointed! If you normally like cream-of-whatever soups OR dislike green bean casseroles.....this probably WON'T be for you! We just love it - thank you!!!

This was planned for a Christmas party of 11 so I was shocked when I realized that this recipie made just enough to fill a 9 inch square glass dish.  I ran back to the store for more stuff and the next dish I added cream of mushroom soup instead.  Both turned out well, but the fisrt batch with sour cream was ALL GONE on the first pass.  No leftovers.  I could tell a difference in the flavor between the two.  What's interesting is that my family has made GB casserole for years with cream of mush and they loved the sour cream mix better.  Cooked on 325 for an hour.  Nice crust on top.

For us, the flavor lacked something.  It was just okay.  Great consistency and looked good, but the overpowering flavor was sour cream.  I will keep looking for a different green bean casserole for us.

I quadupled this recipie for an office potluck. I was hoping to bring some home, and I was close to not getting my wish. Everyone loved it. I added french onions into the mix and put some on top as well for texture. Make SURE that you get french cut beans and not whole cut. There is a huge difference in how the casserole holds up by using the wrong bean.

In high school my friend who enjoyed cooking use to drone on about various casseroles and I had to ask him exactly what a "casserole" was.  My Japanese mom just didn't make them.  Five years ago at Thanksgiving time, my then BF's 11 yo. nephew went on and on ad inifinitum about "Green bean casserole."  I told him I didn't know what it was so he insisted I try it at Turkey Day dinner.  I didn't like it much.  Later, my current BF mentioned how he wanted it so I found this recipe, and behold--This was great! I halved the flour and salt.  Sauteed the onions before adding, and stirred in half the cheese and sprinkiled the remaining on top.  I now like green bean casserole.

Made scaled down versions of this and 2 other green bean casserole recipes looking for an alternative to the one that uses cream of mushroom soup.  My family (5 of us) all taste tested all 3 and this one won.  The only things I did different was that I used frozen green beans (cooked and drained first), stirred some of the cheese into the beans, and stirred in some bacon bits I had cooked up for one of the other casseroles.  I did get the request to add more bacon to it next time so that is definitely a good addition.  The only other thing that I would do different is cut the salt a bit.  Cheese is very salty plus I added the bacon which is also salty so mine was overly so.   I like the thought from some of the other reviews of sauteing the onions first and adding a bit of pepper and garlic, too, so I may try that when I make it for Thanksgiving.  Overall a good recipe though.  Very flexible for altering to tastes.

I always make the green bean casserole from the back of the fried onion box and wanted to do something different.  This was better by far, but next time I'll saute the onions first (they were kinda crunchy) and I did 2 cans french and 1 can cut green beans to change up the texture.

First off let me state that I am not a casserole maker.Secondly I would not want to be critical of anyone's grandma but, with this recipe it wasn't even considered.This dish has it all,moistness,crunchiness and flavor too.I made this the first time for half the family who were home and they all had seconds and said this one is a keeper.I made it the following week for everyone and made a few changes.Instead of canned green beans I steamed fresh green beans beforehand.The original substitutes the old standby of canned mushroom soup for a sour cream based sauce and I left that alone.Also the french fried onions were substituted for crackers. I had french fried onions on hand and used them as the topping for taste and presentation.I reduced the amount of cheese by half and it still was good.To keep the mushroom flavor I sauteed some fresh sliced button mushrooms in garlic butter. I used the drippings from this pan to lightly brush the crackers then sprinkled with fresh herbs diced small and added one tablespoon of Mrs Dash seasoning. This gave the dish a wonderful mushroom flavor and the crunchy seasoned crackers on the bottom kept the dish from being too wet.This is a great side dish whether you stick with the recipe or tweak it just a bit.

I've made this recipe twice and both times it was excellent. The two times that I've made it, I left out the flour, used less salt, added pepper and the first time I used garlic, like some other's have suggested. The first time I thought I had done something wrong because the sour cream seemed to curdle, but I realized the second time around, that I think the flour serves a purpose: to prevent the curdle effect and to hold the ingredients together.  I used Jack cheese and topped with the crunchy French's onions like others have suggested, I think really no matter how you make it or what you add or change, it's still basically green beans and sourcream and it's so so good! Thank you to Amy Barry for the great recipe.

This is a great recipe.  (Just don't use frozen green beans).  My husband loved these and asked when I could make these again. (Thank goodness my brother in law found this recipe and suggested it.) Will make many more times.  Thanks for the post.

My husband loved this!  I could only give it 4 stars because I did modify. I read a ton of reviews before making it.  I did cook the onions in the butter.  I tried the casserole in 4 seperate crocks...2 with swiss cheese and 2 with cheddar, than one of each of those with the french fried onions and the other with the buttered crackers.  My husband LOVED the ones with the onions mixes.  So on Thanksgiving, the winning casserole will have cheddar and swiss cheeses and french fried onions! Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a super easy green bean recipie that was easy to prepare and a big hit with everyone! I sauteed some small sliced portobellos and added them and minced garlic to the mix as well. Excellent addition!

Awesooommmmeeee!!! Doubled the recipe... I sauteed the onions in the butter before adding anything, added 1 cup of cheese, 1/2 cup of fried onions and bacon to the green bean mixture. I also topped with  fried onions and bacon over the cheese.  I didnt use the cracker crumbs.  I only got one serving... can't wait to make again.

I LOVED this recipe.  I usually don't like green bean casserole, but I chose this to make for a food day at work.  Everyone loved it.  I took some suggestions of some other reviewers.  I sauted the onion and a clove  of garlic in the butter before adding the flour.  I also added the cheddar cheese in with the green bean mixture instead of putting it on top.  The cheddar cheese would get hard if you're not eating it right away.  It turned out great!  I think I will probably add another can of green beans next time though.  If you add the cheddar cheese with the rest of the mixture, it could use some more green beans.

This was so good! I was trying out a couple of different versions of green bean casserole to decide which I wanted to fix for Thanksgiving. This will be the one! I didn't think it had too much of a sour cream flavor at all, I thought it was just right, a great compliment to the beans. The only thing I might change will be instead of crackers using buttered bread crumbs on top. I thought the crackers just tasted like..well, crackers. But in all it was great and the kids love it! Thanks!

Sorry, this was just a thigh enhancer. This went through three meals and most of it remains in the pan. Everyone said, hey I like this, but then no one ate it nor did anyone re-warm some for the snack plates, a total bust. For me, a waste of cheese.

This was awesome! I changed a few things though because everyone loves the french's onions at my house I did add them to the top. I also mixed the crackers into the dish and added bacon crumbles to it. The consistency came out like a quiche. My mom hates green bean casserole but loved this one!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and I have given the recipe to at least 12 people.  I did saute the onions in a little bit of butter to soften the, and added about 1/2 tsp each of onion and garlic powder.  Used the french fried onions instead of crackers.   For sure a keeper!!

3 and a half stars. This was just alright.. I liked the flavor the onions gave it, but i felt it was a bit dry. Otherwise the flavor was good, but i like things a little... saucey. I think it would be good if i combined components from this and the campbells recipe! :D

I did this for a work potluck today following the recipe exactly as written except that I used a 2 qt dish instead of 2 1/2.  It got rave reviews.  Thanks ... I loved it and it's certainly a break from the old cream of mushroom and fried onion recipe.

I had to make a few changes to make this gluten free, and it came out fabulous.  It is so much better than the dreaded cream o' mushroom soup goo version.  I sauteed the onions first, and then eight chopped mushrooms, then added them to the sauce.  I used two tablespoons of potato starch in place of the all purpose flour.  I followed the directions, but used crumbled gluten free potato chips in place of the cracker crumbs.  This is definitely a gluten free keeper.

I use the same amount of green beans, but I use fresh and steam them thoroughly thru, until a brilliant green and can be stabbed with a fork, then add them to the dish. Also, I carmelize my sweet onion (which I slice into strips rather than a chop), before adding them to the dish.

All the GK's at my house for weekend and all 3 begging for Gmas baked chuck roast, "smashed" potatoes and any green veggie.  I found this recipe and not being able to tolerate the standard greenbean casserole under any conditions, decided to give this a whirl.  One of the GK's asked if they could mop out the bowl with a dinner roll.  All I can say is, next time, I WILL double the ingredients.  This recipe said 10 servings, there were 5 of us and everyone went back for seconds.  A perfect side dish I look forward to doing many times over!  TY!

This casserole was awesome! The only modifications that I made were to lighten it up. My husband and I are on weight watchers so I needed to bring something to Thanksgiving dinner that wasn't going to completely kill our diets. This is what I changed: I used light butter, splenda, FF sour cream, fresh green beans,reduced fat round crackers, and the best part: light velveeta for the topping instead of the shredded cheddar cheese. (light or fat free shredded cheese will harden and not give a good cheesy topping) Everyone enjoyed this recipe-even the non dieters!

I made several modifications to this recipe so I can't really say my rating applies, but it was excellent! We definitely liked it better than using canned cream of chicken/mushroom soup. I made the following changes: used 1lb blanched fresh green beans (could have used 1.5-2lb with the amount of sauce there was) added 1c chicken broth to the roux before adding the sour cream, used 2t onion powder instead of diced onion (I was in a hurry), and used the traditional French Fried Onions instead of Ritz crackers, mixing some in and using some for topping. Love the addition of the cheese!

Served this yesterday & my family, who do not like traditional green bean casseroles, finished the whole batch!  Even my daughter who hates sour cream went back for seconds, which is surprising since it does have an almost overwhelming sour cream flavor to it.  Next time I make it I will cup back on the sour cream a bit.  I followed the directions given with the exception of sauteeing the onions.  Will definitely be making this again.

One word: YUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM!!!! This was such a GREAT recipe and sooo easy too. The cheese on top with the crakers was perfect and the flavor of the onions and sour cream and green beans just melts in your mouth. I was doing a "trial run" on a few recipes that I plan to make for Thanksgiving and I will be making this one for sure!!! Thanks Grandma and Amy!!!

It was excellent, but next time I would probably mix half the cheese into the beans and sprinkle the remaining half on the top as directed.  I also doubled the crackers that are sprinkled over the cheese.

This recipe was THE best green bean casserole ever.  Instead of using the crackers they suggested I used French's fried onions on top.  It was fabulous.  I also a small amount of bacon bits (for flavor) and cut up mushrooms to cook with the rest of the filling.

The onions were a little crunchy, so next time I will saute the onions prior to adding the rest of the ingredients (I don't mind them being a little toothy, but my dad did not care for the crunch).

It was the biggest hit of Christmas dinner this past year. :)

I actually made this dish twice…pre Turkey Day test. Family said it needed something.  So second time around I used 2 bags of frozen French style green beans, additional seasoning - garlic salt and mixed 1 can of Durkee Fried onions with the cheddar cheese.  Made the day before so it was ready to pop in the oven. Served 10 and was delish. Will definitely make this again.

This will turn anyone who hates green bean casserole into a lover. The trick is to use fresh steamed green beans instead of canned. If you use canned it is really salty, too mushy and the sour cream is way too strong. But if you use fresh green beans everything is perfect. I also mixed the Ritz with the classic French fried onions because I like a really crispy top.

I too was worried that I would miss the traditional mushroom soup and french fried onion version of green bean casserole (and was especially worried that those who were at the pitch-in I attended would miss it), but I have not one complaint!  This was fabulous.  I used minced onions instead of fresh, put half of the cheese in the casserole and half on top, and also made this in the morning and refrigerated it all day before adding the crackers and baking (used at least a cup of crushed crackers).  Next time I will try adding canned mushrooms....  Yummy!

I used light sour cream and light cheese, and it turned out delicious. Also substituted canned french style beans with frozen.......worked great, and the beans didn't get too soggy.

Loved it. I didn't want a canned soup version and I am CDN so we are not been casserole people for whatever reason. I wanted to try it though since I had eaten it once and loved it. I just wanted to cut out soe of the processed stuff. So this was perfect. I used light sour cream, light sharp cheddar...bread crumbs in place of buttery crackers. I did add bacon because you need your protein! haha. I also sauteed the onions first as others mentioned and added garlic because those 2 go hand in hand always....it was amazing. Yes I tweaked it but the base is there and it's the first time I ever made it. Definitely going to introduce this to the Thanksgiving line-up.

If you are looking to mask the flavor of Vegetables this is your recipe! Not for those who enjoy vegetables.

Never doing the soup version again! This one blows it away. I didn't change a thing, either.

I was looking for a Green Bean Casserole recipe that didn't use cream of mushroom soup, since my husband hates that.  Found this, and it is wonderful!  I add bacon for a little something extra, but it's great as it is!!

Sorry...tried this recipe twice now.  Once I followed directions to a T and second time tried reviewers suggestions...both times none of us in my family cared for it.  Dissappointed, as we are looking for an alternative to the soup recipe.

The only thing I didn't like about it was the cheese being layered on top of the casserole instead of mixed in with the casserole; some bites were pure chesse because of it. Next time I'll mix it in, then top with crackers... I loved the grilled onions like most reviews said and added chopped ham. I didn't lower the amount of flour or salt but only cause I added another can of green beans. I'll be making it again.

After giving this recipe a bad rating, I decided to try it again with freshly steamed green beans and I ended up with a great vegetable side-dish!  I cook the onions, add minced garlic, light sour cream and omit the butter in the topping.

this was the hit of turkey day. i made it for 28 people and came home with less than 1 cup.  i sauteed the onions in butter though, and used a cup of milk, because it was a little dry . but if you ever need a dish to take this is a sure fire winner.

I'm a Navy Wife living in Japan and teach American style cooking to three Japanese ladies and they loved this recipe.  It was fast and easy. A nice change from the mushroom soup type casseroles.  Thanks!

I detest mushrooms so i was excited to try this out. So, like others suggested, I took out half the flour and salt, kept sugar. Subbed salt for seasoning salt. Added black pepper and garlic powder. Just took the onions out (this time, next time I'll put them in 'cause I love me some onion). I steamed fresh green beans in my pressure cooker before mixing everything. Added all the sour cream because I added a bit of extra beans (no such thing as too much sour cream for some of us). Then  added a little more than a cup of cheese to the mixture and therefore added a Lil less then half cheese on top (to equal the 2 cups). Finished it off with a homemade french onion recipe (just milk n flour basically) and wala! Delish! I'll give it a four because of all the editing.

I made a few changes based on others reviews and it was fantastic! I sautéed the onions in a tbs of butter until softened, used a little less sour cream, added garlic powder and pepper, and mixed in half the cheese with the green beans and the rest on top. Made it the day before without the topping, then when I was ready to bake topped it off then in the oven it went!

This was soo good. I used fresh french green beans instead of canned. It was hard to get correct measurements for fresh green beans. I ended up buying too many (two bags of 32 oz, thinking I'd use one and half, but one and half was too many for the small amount of sour cream mixture it made). Next time I will double the mixture. I also added the dried crunchy onions to the top mixture.

Okay, I have a confession. I've been making this casserole for at least 4 years and I still haven't left a review.  So, as I am compiling my grocery list to make this for TWO potlucks this week, I felt like it was time.  This is my FAVORITE green bean casserole. I have never been a fan of cream of mushroom soup so this was always on the bottom of the list to make or eat during the holidays.  Now, I make it ALL the time!  

After 4 years, I've tweaked the recipe just a bit to my liking but the base recipe is still delicious!  

I saute the onion for 3-5 minutes and toss in some fresh minced garlic for the last 30 seconds or so before I make the roux.  I mix about 2/3 of the cheese in with the green beans mixture.  After topping with the rest of the cheese and the cracker mixture, I add some crispy fried shallots.  There are NEVER leftovers!

My family loved this!  The sour cream taste is a bit much, may scale it down a bit next time.  I had left over bacon and added it to the top of mine and it gave it an interesting taste.  Hubby loved that part!  Definitely a recipe I will be making again.

Loved this recipe! Made this for our holiday dinner and everyone loved it. I did take the advice of the other reviewers and used fresh green beans, cooked the onions a bit to soften them, mixed half of the cheese in with the green beans and used french fried onions. Great flavor!

I cooked fresh green beans for this recipe and substituted chopped scallions for the onion since that is what I had on hand.  My whole family liked the dish, but we were split 50-50 on whether we preferred this recipe or the traditional green bean casserole.  The verdict: will keep and use both recipes!

I thought this was excellent.  I didn't have an onion (or I would've sauteed it first to make sure it wasn't crunchy) but I did add a little onion powder, and also mixed in some crushed up french fried onions with the crumbled crackers.  Everyone thought it was delicious!  Even my husband, who doesn't like too many vegetables, or "casserole" type dishes, liked it.  I will definitely make this again, thank you!  Oh, I also mixed the cheese in with the beans as suggested by others.  Very good!

I pretty much followed the recipe but used frozen green beans instead of canned.  This was good and a popular choice at my dinner, but I felt it was a little bland and will have to think of something to perk it up before I serve it again.

I love this recipe!  When I make it, I omit the sugar and the crackers.  I fry up three or four pieces of bacon and saute the onion in about a TBS of the bacon fat, a teaspoon of butter and the flour.  I then add the green beans (I think fresh are better), the onions, sour cream, the crumbled up bacon, a cup of the cheese, and some of the French's fried onions that are usually traditional with this dish.   Season to taste.  This all goes into a casserole dish, and it is topped with the remainder of the cheese and sprinkled with some more French's fried onions.  Even my husband, who HATES sour cream, loves this dish!  A definite keeper!

I followed the directions exactly, and it was quite good. I'd probably use a little less crackers on top next time, but that's just my personal taste.

This was yummmy. Like others I did half sour cream, half cream of mushroom. I also thought cumbled bacon would be a nice touch. All I had was turkey bacon though, which was still very good. I think some cracked pepper would be a good addition to this recipe as well. My boyfriend and his friends loved it.

Followed this recipe except for substituting a shake of onion powder for the onion (don't like onion pieces in casseroles).  This was pretty tasty! I had been wanting to try this for a while since my husband loves green beans but hates mushrooms so won't eat the traditional GBC.  He liked this as well but thought it was a little too 'zesty' which could be because I used extra sharp white cheddar (all we had on hand).  I also took the reviewers suggestion of mixing the cheese with the green bean sour cream mixture and am glad I did.  I will probably make this again but next time will use a very mild cheddar, a little less sour cream, maybe 2/3 cup, and the traditional french fried onion topping.  The cracker topping was great but I missed those crunchy onions :) Thanks for a great recipe for those who don't eat mushrooms!

This recipe is wonderful and very rich.  I mixed half the cheese in with the beans like some of the others and that seemed to work good.  I also brown my onion in the butter at the beginning, since I'm not much of an onion person.  Will definitely try again.

this was wonderful!  i did a dry run before thanksgiving and used the recipe scaler to downsize to use about one can of beans.... i followed what others had said and put half the cheese in the bean mixture and the rest on top. i was in a hurry and so i put my fresh onions that i had diced in just a very little amount of margarine/butter and put in the microwave for a couple minutes so they would not be crunchy... then i put the whole casserole minus the crumb mixture in the microwave for about 4 minutes to get it hot and bubbly and then popped it on the oven until the crumbs were browned.. this was great.. much better than the usual green bean casserole.... thanks to the creator...;-)

Am testing recipes to be used for Thanksgiving.   First, I made this the day before (minus the topping), the next day added the topping, one side french fried onions, the other side crushed crackers mixed with melted butter.  It was great made the day before (always important for Thanksgiving).  My family liked the crushed cracker topping better, which surprised me.  Crushed crackers it is!!!  I did use frozen french cut green beans, and as reviewers suggested, I did saute the onion in the butter in the first step.  I also added sliced button mushrooms and would continue to do that in the future.  As with any recipe, you have to adjust to your families preferences.  I serve 30 for Thanksgiving and this recipe will be on the table this year.

GOOD EATS!!!
No more Cream of Mushroom soup!!
After reading previous reviewers comments, I too sautéed the onions in the butter (actually Country Crock). Added the flour till smooth, the sour cream and 1tsp.salt, pepper and the sugar. Tasted for seasoning..a bit "one note" so added one tsp. garlic powder, several dashes of paprika..and yes a few dashes of soy sauce. Re-tasted..much more savory with more depth of flavor. Added the steamed green beans (Birds Eye "steamers"..2 bags microwaved in bag for 6 minutes first). Mixed all together with about 1/2 cup of cheddar, along with french's fried onions. Baked 15 minutes then topped with fried onions mixed with 1/2 cup of cheddar and finished the last 15 minutes of baking, I had noticed in the pictures that many of the tops looked a bit too brown, adding the topping the last 15 minutes of baking made a golden brown crunchy topping. Yum..perfecto

This is a great recipe! I am not a mushroom fan so I was trying to find the perfect green bean cassarole dish. Definitely saute the onions in the butter and mix the cheese in the casserole so it doesnt form a hard crust as it bakes. I am asked to bring this every Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this tonight in taste testing for my TG dinner.  Didn't want my guests to be guinea pigs.  It's pretty good.  I didn't have the round buttery crackers, but I had the rectangular ones. I'll be making this on Thanksgiving with a few modifications.  I will add the canned fried onions in and on top of the casserole. I will add a little garlic and also saute the onions first along with some mushrooms.  Great flavor just needed a little tweaking for the casserole I was trying to achieve. Thanks for sharing.

My sister-in-law was hosting Christmas dinner and I was told that I was to bring the green bean casserole. I know these are often a holiday tradition for many families but I had never even tasted one before! Ack! What to do? Ran to allrecipes.com, pulled up green bean casseroles, and sorted by rating. Never has failed me yet!

 I made the recipe with only one small alteration, using french fried onions instead of crackers at the suggestion of another reviewer and the result was delicious. So much so that my sister-in-law's family called me prior to Christmas each year to ask me for the recipe for "the green bean casserole that is better than my mom's." Allrecipes.com to the rescue again.

This was not for us. I wanted something different than the plain old traditional green bean casserole so I made this for Christmas dinner. I made it exactly as posted. Out of 10 of us only one person said it was just ok, the rest didnt like the flavor. But give it a try, you may love it since so many others do. Never know what ya like until you try new things.

We used frozen green beans and this didn't turn out well. I think either frozen won't work or you have to let it thaw out first.

I made this for Thanksgiving as I didn't have the condensed soups to make the "typical" green bean casserole. I must say I am glad I tried this recipe. It was delicious and everyone loved it over the original recipe. This will now be our green bean casserole for Thanksgiving.

This is a delicious alternative to the mushroom soup/fried onion version. After reading several reviews I sauteed the onions in butter until they were soft before adding the flour. I also think the salt can be reduced by half. I mixed half of the cheese into the bean mixture as well and used the other half for the topping. If you are not afraid of calories, add some crumbled bacon to the topping for an extra treat :)

I think this is definitely better than the typical "mushroom soup" green bean casserole. However, I felt like something was missing but I am not sure what. 
I followed the directions and would definitely reduce on the salt, especially if you plan on substituting crackers with fried onions (as they are pretty salty in my opinion).

This green bean casserole was great! I have always loved green bean casserole, but not the cream of mushroom soup, so this was perfect. The only thing I changed up was I still used the french's onions in it and on top of it, I'm not too crazy about cracker toppings.

My husband tasted this before we even set the table and said “OMG...this is the best green bean casserole I’ve ever had!”  It’s not fancy but it’s good!  Made the recipe just as it is written.

My family & I loved this recipe.  What a nice change from the green bean casserole w/cream of mushroom soup.  I made a few minor changes with a little less salt & sour cream & the addition of a little blk pepper & a can of french fried onions.  The fam said it was amazing!  I will use this recipe from now on!

We liked this change from the traditional green bean casseroles made with cream of mushroom soup (although I am pretty fond of them!). I used blanched fresh green beans (about 1.5 lbs) and topped with french fried onions. It turned out pretty tasty! It's a little heavy on the sour cream taste, but we didn't mind that too much. Thanks for the new recipe! :)

I added diced mushroom to the sour cream and cooked it; like condensed mushroom soup without the additives! Used fresh green beans and the usual fried onions instead of crackers. Husband liked it.

I was sure that I was going to try this when I saw how many good reviews it received. I made it exactly as described - just cut the cheese in half because I felt that it was way too much cheese (and we enjoy cheese). This dish was mediocre at best, and that's me being kind. I love green beans (however, not a big fan of canned green beans and that may have been the main cause to why I thought it was not good), but this came out much worse than I was expecting because of all the rave reviews. I will NOT be making this again. Disappointed.

The only change I would make is that the cheese on the top is really unnecessary - the sauce is so amazing without extra cheese!

If you like this dish but always thought the basic recipe (cream of mushroom, canned beans, onion stuff) could be improved than you were right!  I recommend following this recipe but cutting out some of the heavier ingredients (maybe use light sour cream and 3/4's of the cheese called for).  You could also add some fresh mushrooms.

Perfect as the recipe is written!  I made this for Easter last year and our 3 nephews (ages 19-22) ate it up so fast that I didn't get more than a spoonful to try myself!  I am surprised that the dish wasn't licked clean!  Not a very healthy recipe, but worked great for me.

The sour cream is so much better than the bland and watery cream of mushroom soup!  It's zesty, but I think 3/4 cup is perfect- I can see how other reviewers suggested 1 cup was too much.  3/4 cup seemed just right.  I also added French's Fried Onions, it's just not green bean casserole without.

I didn't particulary care for this recipe.  It was just okay and not what I think of when I heard green bean casserole.  There was way too much sour cream and it became overpowering.  I won't make this again.  I'd go back to plain cream of mushroom soup before this.

This is my 2nd review - I couldn't figure out how to edit the first.  Using fresh green beans, I cooked them for 8-10 minutes.  Guests thought they were good but commented (and I agreed) that they could have been a little more saucy. Consider using 1.5C sour cream, even mixed with a tiny bit of chicken broth.

I was so tired of the same old boring green bean casserole with mushy beans and was so excited when I came across this recipe. I have made this recipe so many times and my family loves it! I find it tastes better to use frozen whole cut green beans and I use French's french fried onions instead of crumbled crackers. mmmm and use extra cheese!

This was really good.  I love green bean casserole, but usually I am the only one who eats much of it.  This year I used this recipe and there were no leftovers.  I did put some fried onions on it as it just doesn't seem right without it.  I also used the cracker crumbs. Thanks for sharing!

My Mother HATES green beans and she loves this recipe.  I also add half a can of Frenches Fried Onions to the mixture and the other half on top of the cheese instead of the crumbled crackers.  We will never make a green bean casserole with the canned soup again.  Awesome casserole year round, THANKS GRANDMA!

This is by far my favorite green bean casserole recipe. I found it in a magazine probably about 10 years ago.. it was a hit, and my grandma even considered her casserole retired after that. The only reason she continued to make it was because my sister didn't like this one.

The recipe I have has a very slight adjustment to this one; it calls for corn flakes as the topping instead of crackers. I love the crunchy bite of corn flakes mixed in with the great taste of the rest of the casserole. Also, I often sprinkle a little bit of cheese throughout the rest of the casserole.

One problem I've always had with this recipe is that there's a lot of liquid still in it. I don't know if that's just the nature of this recipe or not, because I often let the beans drain for an hour or so... if anyone has a hint on this for me, that would be great!

I took the advice of fellow reviewers and sauteed the onions until they were translucent and also decreased the flour and salt by half.  I added half of the cheese to the green bean mixture and then put the remaining cheese on top.  The next time I make this I am also going to add more crackers to the top.. I love the crunch of it.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I made this for Thanksgiving for the first time, and it was DEMANDED that I also make it for Christmas! Even family members who don't usually like green bean casserole were going for seconds and thirds! I followed other reviewers' suggestions by: using frozen french-cut green beans (not canned), adding bacon and doing 1/2 a cup of sour cream and half a can of Cream of Mushroom soup (well, I like it a bit more creamy, so I probably used about 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 can of the soup). I also added 1 1/2 cans of French Fried onions to the green bean mixture, and 1 1/2 cans to the topping (increased the butter to 2 tbsps to the topping because of this). Yum yum yum, this has become a traditional dish at our holiday gatherings.

Simply THE best green bean casserole, ever. I didn't measure any of the toppings, just topped the sour cream-green bean mixture with enough of a shredded Mexican cheese combo to cover it generously, subsituted bread crumbs for the crushed crackers and also covered generously, then tossed as many onions as would fit on top. Watch closely in the oven! Within 15 minutes, mine was browned on top, so I covered loosely with foil and let it warm up in the oven for the remaining 15.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was awful.  All we could taste was sour cream.  Never again will I make this. No one ate it, I scraped it off every plate.

Entire extended family love this dish. We've made this several times for our holiday meals and now it's one that is a special request. I've always used steamed fresh beans and not canned. Enjoy!

You could really taste the sour cream, which made it too tangy.  I am going to stick with the Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I am sorry that I tried this variation for our Thanksgiving Dinner with friends and family.

This is so simple but so yummy. I used frozen baby green beans instead of tinned. Also used breadcrumbs instead of cracker. Next time I will leave out the flour as the sour cream was thick enough. I have never tasted the Mushroom Soup casserole other reviewers are talking about and never want to - this is so good!

Wow, this was a hit at Thanksgiving!  I made the following alterations: rather than canned beans I used 1.25 pounds of fresh green beans, cut into thirds and steamed.  I also mixed in half of the cheddar with the beans/sour cream mixture and used fried onions instead of the crackers.  It was absolutely delicious and very easy.  I made it ahead of time and just popped it in the oven 40 mins before dinner (extra time since it was chilled.)  Yummy!

Yuck! I made this for an early Thanksgiving party this past weekend and out of the 20 people there, no one liked this! This was the first time that I ever made a green bean casserole because I don't like cream of mushroom soup. But, I will never make it again!

This is a very bland recipe.  Mine did not have much flavor other than tasting a bit sour.  I won't be making it again.

This recipe was pretty easy to make. Half liked it, the other half didn't. It depends on how much you like sour cream, as you can really taste it. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was delicious!  I made it for Christmas dinner and the
 whole family loved it.  Like many others did, I mixed some of the cheese 
into the grean bean mixture, and put the remaining cheese on top.

This was delish.  my whole family loved it at christmas dinner.  I will make again and again.  I added a little more sour cream, used fresh, steamed green beans and used french fried onions instead of fresh.  I mixed the cheese in with the bean mixture and added 1 cup of french fried onions.  I also mixed an additional cup of french fried onions with the buttery crackers and sprinkled on top!

I totally agree, this recipe is REALLY good!  I added extra onions, and I loved it, but my husband, who is less of an onion fan, suggested I lighten up on them.  But despite that, he really liked it.  And believe everyone else, you should absolutely mix the cheese in and then sprinkle extra on top. This dish is rich, tasty, and will be a big hit!

I made this last Sunday. It was a big hit with everyone. Instead of putting all the cheese on top, I mixed half in with the casserole and put the rest on top. It is the best green bean casserole I have found. Thanks, Amy,for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe was fantastic.  I brought it to our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner received at my in laws and everyone was so impressed including my discriminating father in law.  The only thing I did differently was added a few more onions and at the request of another person, mixed the cheese to the beans instead of putting it on top. I made it for 12 servings instead of the original 8.  It was a huge success!  I will be making it for Christmas as well.  Thank you!
Also note: I wanted this recipe to be low carbohydrate as well...so I eliminated the flour and crackers and it still turned out great!!

My better half loves Green Bean Casserole. I used this recipe and gave it a little variation of my own, and he flipped over it.
Instead of using chopped onion, I thinly sliced the onion and baked it in the oven until crispy. I then topped the casserole with them.
I also used the buttery round crackers and just loved them!

My family has been making this green bean casserole for 40 years and LOVE it. It is our favorite holiday dish.  I made that other soup green bean thing and noone ate any of it. Only thing I gave up doing is the crunchy crackers- we liked it just as well without.

The people that ate this, absolutely loved it!  I followed the recipe, except for instead of using the crackers I did use French's Onions and added some mushrooms.  This was only so it wouldn't look different to the kids eating it.  I made this hours before and was able to bake at our family's house.  Was so easy.  I thought about steaming the green beans, but used the can and it tasted wonderful.  This will become a staple for me during the holidays.  I highly recommend!

I've made this twice now: 4 stars for the recipe as written and 5 stars with the recommendations of others. Saute the onions in the butter first before adding the flour and seasonings. I included garlic and black pepper in the seasonings. Also, many recommend cutting back on the sour cream but instead, I used an extra can of the French green beans. I incorporated about 1/4 of the cheese in the mixture and also used french fried onions (with a little melted butter to coat) as a topping instead of the crackers to give it that classic crunchy topping. Perfect!

Let me start off by saying, I do not like green bean casserole at all! However, this recipe had me coming back for more! I have been making this recipe for 5 years now, and anyone who tries it asks me for the recipe. It is always gone quickly and I always get requests to bring it. It is a winner! A real must try!!

Usually I don't do reviews for recipes but this one definitely deserves it! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I made an extra one just because I ate most of the first one by myself.  I used the fried onion strings instead of the crackers and it was way too salty so I would advise against that and this recipe doesn't make make much (hence the second one) so I would recommend doubling! Soooooo good!

I was very excited to add a "new" green bean casserole to my repertoire, we were all pretty much over the old standby.  I took the advice of Kimar and halved the flour and salt, sautéed the onion first (I would have done anyway) and mixed most of the cheese into the sour cream.  All of those things worked well.  I couldn't leave well enough alone, though.  I decided to add about 2 cups of mixed, slice mushrooms to the onion sauté (this required a bit more butter/olive oil, about another 2 tablespoons) and let that cook for a pretty long time, probably around 10 minutes, they were very well caramelized.  I then proceeded with the rest of the compilation but caved and added about a 1/2 c. of Trader Joe's fried onion bits to the sauce, as well as about a 1/2 cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  I also layered the green bean mixture with some of the cheese, that worked well, incorporating it nicely into the casserole.  I added the remaining cheese on the top, under the cracker crust (I added some of the french fried onions to the crackers, as well).  When I make this again, I'll eliminate the top layer of cheese and incorporate it into the sauce, it just was to "hard" with the cracker crust.  All in all, the comments basically ran like this; "Who made the green bean casserole, it's awesome!"

This was awesome last year. This year I revised it just to be different.
In stead of fresh onions, I used 6oz of French's Fried Onions, reserving1/2c for casserole topping.
Added 4oz cream cheese.
Added 1c shredded cheddar cheese.
Added 1 can each of cream of chicken condensed soup and cream of celery condensed soup.
Added 3c chicken broth (I use coffee water with bullion cubes or paste).
I mixed all ingredients except the 1/2c fried onions, which I put on top of the casserole before baking.
My clan loved it!

I have made this before and my family loves this. They have requested it for this Thanksgiving.  I love the crunchy butter flavor of the crackers so I add just a little more.

Update 2: 11/16/15 
I just received a request to make them for this Thanksgiving as well.  This recipe is a winner.

This is a new favorite at Thanksgiving! It still has the great flavor of green bean casserole, but slightly more sophisticated.

This recipe has actually been around since at least the 70's. A lady from church brought it to every potluck dinner and my mom has been making it for the holidays for as long as I can remember. It is my go-to side dish when I want to impress. You can easily make it a day in advance and then add the cracker crumb topping just before baking.

I love this. I love this recipe so much! I have made it multiple times and know I will continue to make it. I have switched over to using fresh green beans instead of canned which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The fresh green beans add a nice fresh taste and texture to this dish. Thank you for sharing this with us!

This is my all time favorite Green Bean Casserole. It is so simple to make and delicious. I've made this recipe for years. I add a little garlic and saute with the onions and its scrumptious. My family always request this for the holidays!

Great recipe.. I added 1 more can of green beans and cut the sour cream to 3/4c per suggestions.. Everyone LOVED it! Was asked to make for every Thanksgiving from now on, replacing my SIL's (needless to say she was a little upset) :)

Everyone loved it! I just used fresh beans and steamed them for 12 minutes instead of canned beans. and added fried onions in the bean mixture, and on top before putting it to bake. Its not green bean casserole without fried onions! :) YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!

I made this today for Thanksgiving.  I'm bad for trying new recipes for a crowd rather than trying them at home in private first. I trusted the reviews and gave it a try.  This was really, really good, and I got many compliments.  I doubled the recipe, and there was very little left over.  My only complaint is that it was too salty...still delicious, but definitely too salty. I doubt eliminating a tsp of salt will make a difference, so it must be the cheese.  I'm not sure if reducing that will make a difference, but I will give it a try next time...and there will be a next time!

This is a Holiday tradition, with a few minor changes. Always use fresh vericort beans, steamed and sautee the onions a bit! We also substitute French's fried onions for the cracker topping. Much better then canned beans with mushroom soup.

The absolute tastiest green bean casserole we've ever had!  I have been making this for our large, extended family's Thanksgiving meal for 3 years.  It's always a must-have dish.  My family doesn't like the mushroom-style casserole but absolutely loves this one!! The only tweak that I make is to add a handful of crushed french fried onions to the cracker mixture.  It adds just a little extra flavor!  So yummy!

Excellent alternative to the cream of mushroom version. I threw in an extra can of beans, sautéed the onions in butter before adding them, mixed the cheese into the bean mixture and sprinkled French fried onions on top in addition to the cracker mixture. Awesome recipe!

I too was looking for an alternative to the classic green bean casserole.  I tried it and added the black pepper and 3/4 t. garlic powder.  I also added half of the cheese with the green beans and the rest on top.  It was great and the only thing I would change is not adding the salt as the cheese is salty and we felt the dish was too salty as prepared, otherwise it is our new go to recipe for green bean casserole.

I think it's funny how polarizing this recipe seems to be. If you love it, you REALLY love it. Those who don't, REALLY don't. Growing up I always HATED green bean casserole because it was always made with cream of whatever, but I am in love with this dish. I only make a few very minor changes based on my personal taste. I prefer to steam fresh green beans rather than using canned, I sautee the onion, I only use about a cup of cheese (and only on top), and I am obsessed with fried onions, so I put those on top instead of the crackers. Oh, and I maybe use a little less salt and add pepper. Overall, this recipe is one I look forward to having with Thanksgiving dinner every year.

Easy to make and very tasty.  Took off one star because too salty if you make it as written.  Next time will use half the salt.

This recipe is great all by itself.  I've recently gone vegetarian and it's a great dish to make along with roasted potatoes.  Very filling.

I made the following changes so it would be healthier (with almost a negligible effect on taste):  fat free sour cream, 1.75 cups of fat free cheddar cheese, green beans without any salt/sugar added, and reduced fat crackers. I also sautéed the onions first as other reviewers have recommended.  Next time, I'll probably add more onions and use fresh steamed green beans as opposed to canned green beans.

An exceptional side dish that even the grandchildren enjoyed. 

We used the recommended fresh, steamed beans and added French fried onions into the beans which gave it nice texture and flavour. 

This will be a new favorite at special dinners.

I must say this turned out much better than expected.  I did saute the onions with butter and added minced garlic and then added the rest of the ingredients and also added the shredded cheese in the sour cream before mixing with beans.  FRESH beans is a must!

I have to give this more than 5 stars but won't let me :).  I have made this for 2 years straight now on both Holiday's and everyone loves it.  The only thing we do different is my boyfriend is Gluten Intolerance so I put Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour.  Instead of Buttery Round Crackers, we use Rice Chex.  Let me tell you, very, very, good :)

SO GOOD.  I'm SO not a green bean casserole person, but I was asked to bring this to my family's Thanksgiving dinner so had to come up with "my recipe" for it--glad I chose this one--it's a great spin on a classic.  Be sure to use FRESH GREEN BEANS if possible--I did and they were a HUGE hit--really changed the dish up for the better!  I'm making it again this year--it got raves!

I brown the onions in butter before adding them to the butter/flour mixture, and it makes a huge, delicious difference! I also omit the salt, add 3/4 t. pepper, and double the amount of crackers on top. My family requests this for every holiday.

I love this recipe!  We use fresh beans and boil them until soft then follow the recipe pretty much as-is (although I will substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream depending what we have on hand.) 

We've made it every couple of weeks since we first tried it and it's definitely a new favorite!

I chose this recipe because my daughter requested Green Bean Casserole for Easter and I try to avoid recipes that call for processed ingredients.  We thought it was ok.  It was edible and no one complained about it, just not something I'd make again.

I used a pound of fresh, steamed greenbeans instead of canned - next time I'd use a pound and a half, plus cut the beans smaller. I'd also add more onion - maybe a third of a cup instead. I'd also cut the cheese down to 1.5 or maybe 1.25 cups instead. Instead of normal Ritz crackers, I crumbled those thin ones - the Parmesan Herb flavor - worked out great. I also topped it with a few of the cheddar fried onions - definitely add that again.

UPDATE: I used canned this time, still topped with fried onions, decided to keep the cheese the same. They were the most-requested "seconds" at my Thanksgiving table.

I am not a fan of green bean casserole in general. I chose this recipe because all of the very basic ingredients sounded good. I was shocked at how delicious it was! Even my kids like this now, it is a new favorite!

Followed the recipe. Would I make this again? Sure, but I would definitely use fresh green beans, less salt, and use unsalted butter next time. It was a little salty for my taste.

It turned out okay.  It was definetly different than our traditional green bean casserole.  It was a hit with most.  There was a distinct taste and if you didn't like it, you didn't like it.

I used fresh blanched green beans. Spread the cheese all throughout as recommended by others. I used less sour cream as others recommended but next time would probably cut on the flour, as the sauce turned out pretty thick and difficult to toss with the beans. Still turned out pretty delicious.

This is the best green bean casserole recipe on the planet. I don't even need to try the others to know this! Every single time I make it, people RAVE about it. "Mmm, oh my gosh, this green bean casserole is AMAZING!" and "I don't even like green beans, but this is SO good!" and "I've NEVER like green bean casserole, but I LOVE yours!"

I do three things differently from this recipe: Fresh steamed green beans instead of canned (or frozen is better too), French's fried onions on top instead of crackers, and about a cup of shredded cheese mixed in with the green bean mixture.

People love the cheese!

This dish is now a staple in my holiday menus!

I'm only giving this 4 stars as written but with my changes (in our opinion) it is a 5 star dish. I don't add the salt and sugar, I use fresh green beans and instead of the crackers I use crispy onions. The onions and cheese topping make this delicious! Yummy!

I made this for our family Christmas Eve Party, the pan was cleaned!! I followed some of the other reviewers' advice. I reduced the sour cream - I put in a little over 3/4 c. I mixed part of the cheese into the beans (1-1/4 C). I also mixed in a 1/4 of a can of the french fried onions. I made another dish on Christmas Day for my husband who had worked on Christmas Eve. He thought it was a little too salty so I will reduce the salt next time. Overall this was a BIG hit and I will definitely make it again.

I used fat free sour cream for this and didn't use as much butter (just the initial amount in the skillet. I also didn't put the crackers on top, but used french fried onions instead. I also only sprinkled the cheese instead of doing the recommended values after reading reviews. My mix was 5 stars. This recipe by itself gets 4.

I guess I am just a fan of the *new way* with condensed/processed ingredients. I did not care for this *old fashioned* version because I felt it was too bland. However, I am not rating it poorly because of that. It was a hit at Thanksgiving with the extended family/friends. So it deserves at least 4 stars on their behalf.

These are AWESOME and were a big hit at Thanksgiving. My 11yo daughter almost didn't try it, but when she did, she asked if we could have it every year. This is definitely a keeper! Oh FYI, I didn't use the buttery crackers. I mixed in the French onion crunchy thingys with the whole casserole and topped the whole thing with a bit more. As a result, I did use less than a teaspoon of salt. YUMMY!

2 years in running on this one for Thanksgiving.  Very rich but yummy.  This year it was the only handmade dish @ our celebration.  We had leftovers but I made extra anyways.  I was excited because then I got to come home and eat more of it.  This is my new go-to dish for what I bring to our Thanksgiving meal.

This dish was a big hit at Thanksgiving this year and two out of four at the dinner don't even usually enjoy green bean casserole (or "GBC" as they disdainfully called it). However, I persuaded them this was not ordinary "GBC" and they both found that they enjoyed the dish so much, it was the first of the leftovers to get completely gobbled up!

Two thumbs way up for this dish. As for alterations, I used one cup of Colby Jack and one cup of Cheddar since I enjoy the combination of the two better then just Cheddar. Will definitely be making this again and again.

As my husband said, this is really good and really rich tasting because of all of the sour cream. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was missing the awesome crunchiness of the French fried onions from the standard version. I would make this again but use regular cut instead of french style green beans, add some milk to cut down on the sour cream richness, and use fried onions.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner this year.  I sautéed the onions in the butter before adding the flour- good move.  Definitely making again.

This is excellent for those cooking for people that don't like mushrooms or cream of mushroom soup! The sour cream mixture really mocked the classic green bean casserole dish, only without the mushrooms! Aside from that, it's just great overall, and very quick to prepare.

This recipe is ok.  We tried it, following the recipe the first time, and it came out pretty bland.  So, I tried it again.  I substituted greek yogurt for sour cream, and added minced garlic, crushed red pepper, seasoning salt, pepper, onion powder, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  So much more flavor.

Really good and so simple!  I used fat free sour cream and fat reduced cheddar cheese to save some calories.  It was delicous!  My family loved it and I will definitively make it again and again!

Pretty tasty. I like how creamy it turned out to be, however next time I will use a smaller casserole dish. 13x9 is way too big because it sat at the bottom, looked like it wasn't a full dish at all. An 8x8 glass dish would look much better. And I will also add the onion straws, it always makes it taste and look better.

Took a risk and made this for Thanksgiving today without doing a trail run first. Other than only using 3/4 cup of sour cream as others suggested,  I followed the recipe to a T and it was OUTSTANDING!!! There were no leftovers. I will be making this every Thanksgiving!

This is our new green bean casserole! The only thing I changed was to use French fried onions instead of the crackers on top. I increased the recipe to make 15 servings, but instead of adding more sour cream I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. Delish!

its a 4 as is/for me a 5 and a keeper with a few changes. I have made the old cream of shroom version from Campbells.Like the flavor/hate the sllimy canned soup consistency of that one. This one I love the creamy base and found the flavor a tad bland and with too much salt....so I have mixed the 2. I now use this one with only 1/2 tsp of salt and added the 1/4 tsp pepper and 2 tsp Worchestershire sauce from the Campbells version...now it is "just right" for me! I really DO like the crunchy fried onions from the Campbells version...so instead of putting the onions in this one (though it IS admittedly healthier!) I used the fried onions on top instead.

My husband loves the traditional Green Bean Casserole so was not happy that I was making this one but he LOVED this one so much more!  Soooo yummy!  I did still use the fried onions instead of the crackers but this is our Green Bean Casserole recipe from now on.

Made this for a family reunion and had lots of compliments and people asking for the recipe.  Way better than mushroom soup version.  Will be making for thanksgiving and Christmas!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year.  It wasn't too bad when it was still hot, though they all let me know they preferred the mushroom soup recipe.  No one wanted to touch the leftovers. Will be going back to the soup recipe.

I love this dish....its replaced the canned cream of mushroom version at our house for Thanksgiving. I am gf and so I replace the flour with brown rice flour or a gf blend and its very successful, I skip the crackers on top and its not missing. You could use gf crackers...I'm allergic to the flax seeds in the best gf crackers. I hope that help other people who are gluten free.

My dad requests me to make this every holiday season! I do use the french fried onions instead of the crackers but other then that I don't make any changes (Maybe a little less something here...and a little more something there...) and it always comes out great. It's not doing our ateries any favors, but its sooo good. Thank goodness Thanksgving and Christmas only come once a year!

This was definitely different but did not appeal to me. I think it was just missing that fried onion flavor.

I didn't like this recipe very much at all. The flavor was not very full at all...it was just very bland to me and I prefer rich flavor. I will go back to my old green bean casserole recipe of the cream of mushroom base. For me, it packs more of a punch. This was very creative, though!

This is the best green bean casserole!  As a new wife, I started out with the standard green bean casserole that includes cream of mushroom; but an elderly friend of the family gave me this recipe.  Our family of 8, friends, and family love this recipe for any time of the year.  It is a staple during the holidays!

I'm not a green bean fan, but I made this a family reunion a few years ago and now it's what I'm asked to bring to EVERY family function. People rave over this casserole. I do substitute the onion with dried onion and also the crackers for french fried onions. I've done it both ways, and people always prefer the fried onions over the crackers.

Made this for Christmas dinner, but didn't get any exciting reviews. I personally thought it was ok, it tasted fine, and it came out perfect, but just wasn't a hit. I think next year I will try a different recipe :o) Had a great time trying something new though!

Surprisingly bland.  I thought based on all the great reviews and the fact that my family LOVES green beans that this would be a hit.  It turned out to be a major miss!  Never making it again.

KEEPER!  This was really good, way better than the kind with soup.  I think next time, I'll try monterey jack cheese, though.  It's going to be on next year's Thanksgiving menu again for sure.

This was fantastic. I was skeptical about using crackers instead of the traditional fried onions, but I went ahead and did it. As it turns out, I actually PREFER the crackers!   Also, i mixed 75% of the cheese in with the beans and i'm glad i did.  Here's a tip that worked great for me: i used the cheese grater on my onion. I had my onion ready in about 15 seconds, and the size/texture of the onions were perfect for this recipe (i'm not a huge onion chunck fan).  So Good. I made this for thanksgiving and it's one of the few dishes that didn't have any leftovers. I'm probably making it again tonight!

Made a few changes based on other reviews, but this is soooo much better than the traditional green bean casserole.  I served this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved. There was none left and the family requested this one from now on. Thanks!

I made this last week as a trial run for Thanksgiving and the whole family loved it.  I wanted to have an alternative to using cream of mushroom soup and I am really glad I tried this recipe.  The only change I made was to mix in some french fried onions into the mix and sprinkle some on top with the crackers and butter.  Perfect!

i've pre-made this for tomorrow (thanksgiving).  i bought fresh green beans, snapped & steamed them.  i browned the onion as well as two cloves of garlic in butter and then set them to the side as i made the "gravy."  i added the full amount of salt and sugar as fresh green beans are not already salty like canned ones.  after making the gravy i added in the already browned onions & garlic and then greek yogurt (rather than sour cream... i live in italy and we don't have sour cream, greek yogurt tastes pretty much just like it though).  after mixing everything together i actually mixed the cheese (provolone and mozzarella as we don't have cheddar) together with the green beans (as per previous reviewers recommendations).  i topped it all off with the ritz (we CAN get those in italy!)/butter combo and popped it in the fridge until tomorrow.  i can already tell that this is going to be GOOD!  i will follow-up after tomorrow's feast! :)

I really didn't like this.  Partly my fault due to using fresh green bean's but the sauce was so sweet that it was kind of gross.  I don't think I will be trying again with canned beans.

I was looking for a recipe to use some canned green beans I had for awhile and I found this recipe. I made half the recipe with the ingredient amounts I had. I liked that the recipe was a casserole but it had, "no canned soup!" The downside is it is not the most healthy of recipes, so it might be better as a holiday type casserole. And, it was a tad oniony for my taste, and I wished it were a little bit more creamy. Even though I chopped the onions into a very small dice, some even still seemed slightly crunchy. I didn't have the butter crackers in the recipe, so I used oyster crackers and added a tsp. more butter and a pinch of salt to them and it worked fine.

This was a fantastic recipe! A lot better than the usual Campbell's soup recipe. I live abroad and was asked to bring a dish typical of American holiday traditions to a Christmas party, so I chose the green bean casserole. I was unable to find the ingredients for the Campbell's recipe, so I searched for an alternate recipe. This will always be my green bean casserole recipe. I even suggested it to my mom, and she made a batch for Christmas too - everyone at her party loved it too! Even though I loved, the recipe didn't quite suit the taste of the Norwegians who I spent the holiday with.. Excellent recipe!

I really enjoyed this.  I followed the directions and the only change I made was that I used frozen green beans rather than the canned version.  Its what I had on hand.  I think I will steam the green beans next time as opposed to just letting them thaw, but I really enjoyed this and the cheese (for someone who is on a calorie restricted diet) made it that much more yummy!!!

Fantastic! I used fresh green beans that I steamed the night before. Sauteed the onions as well. I would probably cut down the salt by half the next time but otherwise this was great!

I thought this was GREAT! I topped with the buttery crackers and ALSO 1/2 a can of fried onions- my family would have really missed the fried onions! I am giving it 4 stars only because my family said they thought there was too much cheese. I will add just one cup next time- even though I thought the original recipe was great! Much better than the traditional green bean casserole for sure.

My new favorite green bean casserole. Have made it a couple of times now. Love it because it doesn't use mushrooms (I'm not a fan). Also easy to make the night before, stick in fridge, and pop in oven when you are ready to make. Perfect for when you are having company.

This was SOO good! I followed the recipe basically as-is.  I put approx 1 1/2 cup cheese with the beans, and put the rest of the 1/2 cup cheese on top before adding a small can of frenchy's fried onions.  I agree with other reviewers, this is SO much better than the old version with cream of mushroom soup.  This will be my new easy favorite holiday side-dish.  Thank you!  It was very good!

Yummy! Much better than the mushroom soup green bean casserole! I took other reviewers suggestions and decreased the amount of sour cream, salt, and sugar. I also added french fried onion rings.

MIL asked me to bring the greenbean casserole for Thanksgiving, so I thought I'd give this a try. I read the other reviews, and made a few modifications...mixed in a cup of the cheese with the beans and sour cream...sauteed the onion and a handful of chopped baby portabellos...mixed crushed ritz with some french fried onions for the topping...and it was a huge hit! All the family loved it, said they want it for Christmas dinner too! Oh, and I made the casserole on Tuesday night, without baking, stuck it the fridge till thursday and baked it 35 minutes, it was great! I give the recipe 5 stars, even with my modifications, because without the base recipe, I'd have had nothing to play with!

Delicious!! I made this for Thanksgiving and got my dad and brother to actually eat veggies!  I followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and reduced the sour cream to 3/4 C, reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, added black pepper, powered garlic, and mixed half the cheese (1 C) into the beans.  I probably didn't need any salt as the cheese was salty enough. Also next time I might add some half and half to the beans since it was a little too thick and not really "saucy" but still so good.  Definitely a new family favorite!

I made this for a family gathering recently, and they all loved it! I did make a few minor adjustments to the original recipe. I sauteed the onions and one finely chopped red bell pepper (mostly for some extra color) in the butter before adding the other ingredients. I also stirred some additional shredded cheese into the bean mixture before transferring it to the baking dish. I loved the added crunch that the cracker topping gave the dish. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I made this for a Christmas dinner test-run.  Everyone loved it.  Like other reviewers, I added black pepper and garlic powder, reduced the sour cream to ¾ c., reduced the flour to 1 T., and reduced the salt to ½ t.  I also sautéed the onion until translucent before adding it to the flour.  I used French fried onions rather than crackers alone and mixed approximately ½ of the can of onions with the green bean mixture and crumbled the remaining ½ can and the crackers on top of the casserole.  I’ve never made green bean casserole before, so I was very pleased when this came out a success!

I have a green bean casserole recipe that I love, but I wanted something easier for today. The only thing I changed was to saute the onions in the butter until tender before I added the flour and other ingredients. I liked the flavors, but the crackers weren't as good as the traditional fried onions.

I volunteered to bring a "Green Bean Casserole" dish to Easter dinner last year.  Good thing, because my Mom forgot to bring the asparagus.  This dish knocked everyone's socks off.  ...And no over-priced canned onion rings.  This recipe is a keeper, without a doubt.

I was very torn when deciding how many stars to give this recipe.  I don't like to hand out five stars very easily.  This was very tasty, and when it came down to it, this recipe deserves five stars because after all, it is only green bean casserole.  And for how good it tasted for green bean casserole, it earned it.  My family made me make a second dish of it the day after Christmas, because that was the first dish to go, and even with all the other leftovers, they still wanted more of this one.

I will never make the traditional green bean casserole again!!  This was a hit with my family for Christmas.  I did as others suggested...I sauteed the onions first.  Cut back to 3/4 cp sour cream, 1/2 tsp. salt, added 1 tsp pepper and 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I added cheese and fried onions to grn bean mix.  I put more fried onions and ritz crackers in a large ziplock bag, added the melted butter and smashed it all up together for the topping.  Easy and no crumb mess to deal with.  This was the only dish I personally made this year....purchased ham and other sides from honey-baked hams...but this was the dish everyone raved about!

SO much tastier than the mushroom recipes! 
I also only measured 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp. of salt and only about a cup of cheese. I sauteed a clove and a half of garlic with the onion, butter and flour. I mixed in half of a large can of french fried onions to the beans. I mixed the cheese WITH the beans (not on top). I topped it off with the crackers and more french fried onions. SO GOOD!

I crave this too! I can't wait to make it again. I followed most of "momma_s"s modifications, but I like the ritz cracker topping and mixed them into the mixture as well along with more cheese.

Yummy variation from the traditional green bean casserole with cream of mushroom soup.  I used fresh green beans in this (blanch or steam before adding depending on your preference for crunchiness).  And I also add onion and garlic powder to taste to bump up the flavor.  I'll be making this again for Thanksgiving this year.

Usually I don't do first-time recipes for a potluck, but I was short on time and didn't have a good green bean recipe. I whipped up 2 batches of this casserole using both white and purple onions, it was a total hit, nothing left in the dish. I would make this recipe again.

I really don't know why this is rated so high.  It's really just an OK dish - nothing more.  We served it up at supper with friends and there were LOTS of it left over so it wasn't just our take on it.

It completely kills the purpose of eating green beans, but who cares! This recipe is perfection and a must at every table!

Lovely recipe. This is also good with brussel sprouts, or broccoli crowns. If using brussel sprouts, first trim and then halve, and replace half the quantity of onion with shallots first sauted in a pot deglazed with madeira.

I made this for a get together, and everyone absolutely loved it!  "The best green bean casserole I've ever had" was the comment I received from just about everyone there - about 20 people.  It was gone in less than 15 minutes, pan scraped clean!

As some suggested...I did use garlic powder, Fresh beans, french fried onions mixed with the crackers (1/2 in the mix & 1/2 on top), and I sauted the onions before mixing in. AWESOME DISH!!!

Oh my gosh delicious!  Made it for 30 people and had multiple requests for the recipe!  Was unsure about using canned green beans but turned out great.  Didn't change a thing.  This is one of our family traditions now.  In fact, I'm making it for another party tonight!

This was a true test. My husband is all about tradition and does not mess when it comes to the classic green bean casserole. I, on the other hand, prefer not to use canned soups. So I had to pull one over him and hope it didn't ruin his Thanksgiving. Other than topping with fried onions instead of crackers due to the pressure, this recipe rocked! My husband loved this recipe as did all my other guests. Thank you!

I loved this casserole!  So rich and so creamy.  As I was making this, I realized that I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted cream cheese.  I think that made it a little extra rich.

I took the following suggestions and it came out perfect. I used 1/2 Tsp. of salt and only 1 Tbsp of flour. I sauted the onions in butter before adding them. We used the whole 2 cups of cheese and mixed a little less then half into the green bean mixture. We also put some extra crushed crackers into the mixture and added the 1/2 cup on top of the remaining cheese. This was definitely great and thank you so much!

I have been making this recipe for the past two Thanksgivings and it will definitely be on this years menu! It is such a great kicked up version of the traditional Green Bean Casserole. It's even better the day after Thanksgiving! AND kids love it! A+ Amy! Thanks for a great recipe!

This turned out awesome. I made a couple variations, but followed the recipe for the most part: I sauteed the onions in a tablespoon of olive oil to carmelize them a bit before adding them to the butter/flour/salt/sugar mixture. Also, I reduced the salt to only 1/4 teaspoon and used canned green beans with no salt added. I used sharp cheddar cheese. This will be the only way I make green bean casserole from now on!

This is awesome and easy! I have been making this now since Thanksgiving of 2003 and my family raves about it! My in-laws had it last year and now they request it all the time! I follow the recipe exactly, except now I use the french fried onions on top instead of the crackers - FABULOUS!

I loved this and so did my guests! I modified it a bit by using fresh green beans which I steamed briefly before mixing into the casserole. They added some freshness and crunch! Initially skeptical about the cracker top--it turned out delicious!

I have made this recipe for a couple of years now. Always a huge hit, much better than traditional green bean casserole (I always end up picking the fried onions out when I eat more traditional recipes) - love the cheddar cheese, butter crackers, and sour cream. The only change I make is to use half sourcream and half cream of mushroom soup (I tried it once exactly as writen but found I missed missed the mushroomy flavor).

This casserole is awesome!  I loved the sour cream in it.  I added half a can of cream of mushroom soup because I thought it was a bit too thick.  My husband thought adding real bacon bits would be good, and it ended up being a great addition to the flavors of the casserole.

This casserole is FANTASTIC! So much better than the traditional mushroom soup/french fried onion one. I have been making this casserole for the past three Thanksgivings, and it was such a hit, that both my Mom and my sister have asked for the recipe and now make this one instead of the green bean casseroles they had been making for their holiday dinners. The only thing I would recommend is to cut back a little bit on the sour cream, as it contains almost too much of it. Also, this casserole works very well if you prepare and cook it the night before Thaksgiving and reheat it for Thanksgiving Day.  It will definitely save you some time if you do it this way.

I really love this recipe, however, I changed it a bit by omitting the cheese, and the crackers and using the french onions to give it that traditional thanksgiving flair.  It was a huge hit at our last thanksgiving and I shared the recipe several times since.  i also have found basic green beans work great too.

This is the best green bean casserole.  I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I added 1/2 lb. bacon, garlic, thyme, and rosemary. I also saute the sour cream bean mixture in the bacon drippings - people die over this casserole and ask for the recipe everytime.  I will never make another green bean casserole again.

Everyone loved this recipe at Easter!  I don't like crunchy onions so I sauteed them in olive oil and added minced garlic.  Also, because of church in the morning I made it the night before.  The sour cream and onions blended perfectly overnight, then I added the cheese and crackers just before baking.  Excellent!

This is an absolutely perfect, easy-to-make, comfort food. I cooked my very first Thanksgiving feast - had to find good fail-proof recipes, and I decided to include this recipe in my TG dinner menu. It was an absolute hit, and everyone had seconds, and thirds, and carried some leftovers out with them. Highly recommend it, also because it is very easy to make.

I was really looking forward to this dish on Thanksgiving and impressing everyone and it was the least touched dish and no one even wanted it to take home (boo hoo). I really put a lot of effort into our Thanksgiving meal and make everything homemade and thought this would be much better then the standard old green bean casserole, especially with all the rave reviews here. I just can't figure it out, it was soggy and not very good and I served it straight from the oven and followed the recipe to a "T". My husband searched longingly for his french fried onion green bean casserole and was very disappointed in this. Looks like we are going back to the tried and true standard one for Christmas! I really try to give good reviews and don't get disappointed much with what I've gotten here (it's my husband's fav website only because he gets to be the guinea pig in my cooking!). Anyway, my suggestion would be to make this and see if you like it first, before using it for a big dinner with guests. Everyone was disappointed at my house. Sorry!

YUM!! These were a big hit at my New Years dinner! Everyone liked them better than the mushroom soup recipe, I know I'll be making these instead from now on. I had 8 different dishes and 12 guests  and 1 person don't eat beans and my husband didn't have room on his plate, this dish was emptied! The only thing I did different was I omitted the onion and lightly sprinkled on a little garlic powder, used Friendship brand sour cream as it is super creamy, used cut style green beans instead of the french and mixed 1 cup cheddar into the bean mixture and sprinkled the other cup of cheese on top. I doubled the topping by using half of Ritz garlic butter crackers and half Toasteds butter crisps Delicious! I think I might double it for the next big gathering, wish I had some leftover! Thanks Amy and to Grandma!!!!

Oh my gosh...this is the best green bean casserole ever.  I brought it to my sister's for Thanksgiving lunch and everyone loved it!  My sister liked it so much that she threw her standard recipe casserole away and then insisted I make another one of these for her to take to her in-laws for dinner that night.  Everyone there loved it as well.  I have already been instructed to bring this dish to every family gathering from now on!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

It's hard to argue with so many positive reviews, but I have to honestly say that the green bean casserole I've been making for years is much tastier than this one. With all the rave reviews I decided to give it a try this past Thanksgiving. My husband and son were disappointed and declared that I should stick with what I know is good.

THIS WAS A VERY GOOD CHANGE FROM THE TRADITIONAL CASSEROLE.  I SERVED IT AT THANKSGIVING AND EVERYONE ENJOYED IT.  AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS, I DECIDED TO USE FROZEN FRENCH STYLE GREEN BEANS AND I COOKED THEM JUST A LITTLE BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN THE CASSEROLE. I ALSO ONLY USED 1 CUP OF SHREDDED CHEESE BECAUSE I THOUGHT 2 CUPS WOULD BE TOO CHEESY A FLAVOR...  VERY TASTY.

THANKS FOR THE EXPERIENCE.

Very good.  I doubled the recipe to fit my 2.5 liter casserole, used 2 16oz bags of frozen beans instead of the canned, used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of sour cream instead of simply doubling the sour cream, and doubled all the other ingredients.  My family SO loves cream of mushroom soup, I couldn't bear to leave it out completely.  It was a hit!

I think I did something wrong here, although I can't figure out what. I followed the recipe exactly, step by step, and it tasted like spoiled milk. (I tried the sour cream, and it was fine. All the ingredients were fresh.)

This is by far the best green bean casserole anyone I have served it to has tasted.  It is requested that I bring it to every outting or BBQ we are going to.  I do one thing different with the recipe.  Instead of adding cheddar cheese, I cube up 1/3 block of velveeta and cook it with the green bean mixture on the stove until just melted.  It really makes a creamy cheesy side dish.  If I could give it ten stars I would.  Thank you Amy Barry for sharing this recipe.

This was one of the most popular dishes at my Thanksgiving dinner tonight.  My aunt, who eats like a bird, had three helpings.  Not a dish I would serve every week, since it defeats the purpose of eating vegetables, but when you're already inhaling 2000 calories in one meal, I say go for it!

I liked this recipe and enjoyed making it.  I'm not a great cook, so the easiness was appreciated.  I did have to add some extra butter to my crackers, though...they were pretty dry with the amount suggested above.

This was absolutley delicious.  The cheese made a "crust" on the top the first time I made it, however, so I mix the cheese in with the green beans.

Absolutely 5 star.  Served at Thanksgiving last year.  I'll never be able to make it the other way again.  My mother said this was the best green bean casserole she ever had.

I've made this dish twice, both times got rave reviews and an empty casserole dish.  I used fresh steamed green beans, sautéed the onions,  added 1/2 the cheese to the green bean mixture and rest on top.  I also added French fried onion rings as the very top layer over the cracker crumbs.  This is an excellent dish that can be prepped ahead of time.

My family and I love this recipe.  Every time we have family get together, I am requested to make this green bean casserole.  One recommendation is to reduce the sour cream by 1 table spoon, and double the top butter and cracker.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Made this for Christmas, was a big hit.  So much better than the one with cream of mushroom soup.  Only change I made was using French's Fried Onions on top instead of the cracker crumbs.

The only change I make consistently is to sautée the onions and mix half the cheese into the casserole, as others have suggested. I have made this multiple times and always get rave reviews!

This is one of my favorites, but I make a few modifications. Most importantly I always always use FRESH green beans (my family likes them crunchy so I do not steam them fully beforehand). We also omit the onion, cut back the salt, add extra cheese, and will sometimes use fried onion crumbles in place of the cracker topping. There is never any of this left over- it disappears almost immediately! Thank you (and your grandma!) for such a great dish!

So good! I've made this twice. Both times with fresh green beans rather than canned. The second time I cooked the beans before adding them to the casserole. They were still a little crunchy, but not too crunchy like the first time. I also mixed together french fried onions and crackers for the topping, which I was very generous with. Delicious!

This is yummy yummy yummy!  My husband said " this is the best green bean casserole I've ever had, and I've had a lot of green bean casserole. "   I of course added a bit more cheese, but I think it would have been absolutely fine without it.   I even used canned green beans and it was still good ;). I used this for a Thanksgiving side dish, but we'll incorporate it into the regular rotation.

I am not a cook, but was asked to bring a green bean casserole io a Thanksgiving dinner.  I found this recipe ( and this internet site), and by following the video made this dish without any trouble.  It was delicious and everyone liked it.  I have since added several recipes to my recipe box and will be doing more cooking.  This site makes cooking fun!

This is basically how I have made my green bean casserole for a number of  years with just a few slight changes. When you use canned green beans they are salty enough to omit the salt in the roux. Also, instead of the white flour, I use whole wheat flour and it gives it a little bit of a nutty flavor. I am asked to bring it to Thanksgiving every year.

Wonderful, Easy and delicious. I just love this, i do however have a sour cream hater in the family - so i have had to alter this.. I saute my onions (and I add a handful of mushrooms) until translucent in the butter first then remove with a slotted spoon.. First and foremost, i must have frozen french cut green beans. Canned just won't do. I use Philadelphia cream cheese spread (in the tub-NOT brick) with 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk then I add a bit of powdered garlic and a small mix of black and white pepper  all stirred nicely in my very deep pan.  I put the two tablespoons of flour in a resealable bag add my slightly damp green beans, cooled onions and mushrooms then shake to cover finally adding to the pan that is cooking nicely on low heat- bringing it up to medium heat and stirring well! then its transfer to baking dish .. now i scale back on the shredded cheeses because I've used the cream cheese by about  1/2 cup. then follow recipe as usual.  if you hate sour cream and its taste this may be an option for you (not of course if you hate cream cheese too though!) another substitute - heavy cream or half and half, but if you use the heavy cream or half and half, you may need to add a bit more flour. As written this is a jamming good green bean casserole! NO one recipe is ever universally loved nor even hated - think about what you and your family really like and adjust for their tastes - and now... I'm craving  this casserole! thanks for posting!!

My family didn't care for this at all. I won't be making it again. I am pretty sure the sugar was the issue. The only thing I did differently was to use fresh steamed beans. So disappointing.

I decided to make this after seeing it in the Allrecipes magazine and realizing it didn't have cream of mushroom soup in it.  Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (which I never do) and it came out great.  Who says you have to wait for a holiday for green bean casserole?  This recipe is great!

Omit the salt otherwise too salty. One time I added 1 cup cheddar cheese to the green bean/sour cream mixture; the other time I didn't. Cheddar + green bean and sour cream mixture = no leftovers; the other time, the beans didn't look creamy so there were plenty of leftovers. I always use canned green beans not the French style. Yummy!

Not a fan. I thought the green beans tasted more sticky than creamy. I ate it, but I think I'll try something different next time.

The entire time my non vegetable eating son was shoving fork fulls of this in his mouth he said "I can't believe I'm eating vegetables"
 I used red onion because it's all I had. I added most of the cheddar cheese into the casserole and save about 1/2 cup for topping. I also had some french Fried onion from the awful green bean recipe I tried. I added some into the mixture and some on top with crackers    Oh and I used frozen petite green beans, I added them frozen into the mixture although they had pretty much thawed by the time I got them into the oven.  I found I needed about 55 minutes until the green beans were tender.  This was so delicious, I can't wait until tomorrow so I can eat the leftovers! Thanks Grandma!!!

I am sooo glad to find a GOOD recipe for this casserole WITHOUT the canned soup!  I prepared this recipe as written with only one change.  I used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  Yum Yum!  This one is a keeper!  Edit:  I tried it again with 2 changes seasoning salt and instead of crackers, I gotta have the fried onions!  That was all that it needed!  Yum!  Great recipe!

This is definitely not the traditional green bean casserole, but was ok.  I think I will keep searching for the perfect recipe that doesnt use cream of mushroom soup, but this one isnt it.  We didnt really like the tang that the sour cream added.

Made it today with turkey dinner. Everyone loved it! This will be my recipe from now on. I followed exactly as is other than double the cracker topping because it didn't even cover it all. The crunchy cracker on top was wonderful! I changed to 7 servings because I wanted to make it with 2 cans of beans. I am so happy to have a made from scratch version!

Okay, I have a couple of suggestions, but you could make this exactly as-is and people will fall in love.  Despite green bean casserole being a nostalgic food favorite with a distinct flavor that this takes a sharp departure from, I have never once heard that someone wanted it the way they had it when they were a kid, after having tasted this masterpiece casserole.  I don't think I've made this once without it being regarded as the highlight of the evening's food by all parties.

So, what can I suggest to essentially improve on perfection?  MAKE MORE!  Seriously, no matter how much you make, it won't be enough, but I always make at least double.  In addition, I double the crunchy topping because it's my favorite part.  The Ritz crackers are great, but I've experimented a bit with that, most notably with everything Ritz crackers and Cheez-Its, and my favorite so far was the Cheez-Its.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for (almost unheard of for this site anymore) and thought is was pretty good.  Everybody liked it well too.  I'll save this recipe and make it again someday for sure.

My family loves this recipe, we followed momma_s recommendations of  Reducing sour cream to 3/4c, reduce salt to 1/2 tsp, add fresh cracked black pepper, and 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder with the salt & sugar. Large can of French fried onions and mix 1/4-1/2 can into beans, the rest crush with the cracker topping and extra melted butter. Mixed ahead of time until ready to go into the oven for 30 minutes.

I made this as written the night before Thanksgiving, wrapped it tightly and kept it refrigerated. I added 15 minutes to the baking time and it came out perfectly cooked.  My family loved it and asked me to make it for Christmas dinner.  I will add 1 can of green beans, and some crumbled crispy French onions to the topping.
This is a keeper!

No leftovers at Thanksgiving. Along with the other recommendations, I cooked the onion, reduced the cheese, and I switched the crackers out for fried onions.

Delish!
Pretty much followed recipe, just sauteed onions on own before throwing in, used brown sugar because that what I had on hand and mixed the cheese with the green beans leaving a little to sprinkle on top at the end as suggested by previous reviewers.
Will definitely make again!
Thanks for sharing!

My sons love this GB casserole so much so that they wanted it forChristmas dinner this year instead of the asparagus we usually have. I made it last at Thanksgiving last year and this and there was none left. Everyone (22 people ranging in age from 21 to 64) raved about it. I've been told that I have to bring this every year now!

Everyone in my family love this recipe. I have not changed any of the ingredients, I sauteed the onion in the butter until tender and also I  mixed half the cheese with green beans and used the rest as written. My husband kept asking for more, even those in my family who do not like green beans ate them all.

DELICIOUS!!! Served it for Thanksgiving dinner & there was nothing left over. We had 8 ppl and it was the one dish that everyone enjoyed.  Some even sounded disappointed the bowl was empty. I did tweek the recipe b/c we did not have butter crackers in the pantry so...instead I used PANKO BREADCRUMBS. And I used a 4 cheddar blend cheese, too. I think I will keep making the dish that way. I printed the recipe up for others so that they too could make it for others. AGAIN, THIS WAS EXCELLENT! Definitely will be from now on a standard at my table. THANKS!

I LOOOVED this!!! Tired of the "typical" green bean casserole, I decided to try something new this Thanksgiving - and boy am I glad I did! Even my (canned) green bean-hating husband liked this!!! My dinner guests also liked this quite a bit and asked what made it so unique (and yummy!). I pretty much followed Amy's directions to the letter with the exception of a couple (minor) alterations. My biggest change was how I prepared this. I sauteed my onion in butter FIRST, then added the flour, sugar and salt and cooked this mixture for a minute or two. I added HALF of my cheese to my green bean mixture and the rest layered on top as directed. My final changes were to add a 1/2 t of ground black pepper / t of garlic powder (when I added the flour, etc.) and a cup's worth of French's fried onions (1/2 to my green beans and the rest along with my crushed cracker topping). Thanks for sharing, Ms. Barry! I just can't rave enough about how good this was. :-) With my changes, this will most definitely become a regular tradition at my holiday dinner table!

I liked this dish, but it was not one of my favourites. The sour cream came out a bit lumpy and I think I would use a different kind of cheese next time (cheddar was very bland).

This was a very "fancy" version of green bean casserole in which I used nearly every pot and pan in the kitchen to make!  Long prep time aside, I brought this to Easter dinner and it got rave reviews.

I like this version much better than the typical fried onion one as I can control sodium levels more, and add garlic, onion salt, herbs, etc...

i've been using this recipe for years...always a huge hit!  it is great as is.  but i usually make it without the sugar (unnecessary), and bit less sour cream, and if i don't have the crackers i also just use the fried onions sometimes.  always wonderful no matter how you modify it.  and really quite quick to make too :)

This was the best green bean casserole I've ever had.  I made the recipe as directed, except that I sprinkled some french fried onions on the top about 5 minuted before they were done instead of incorporating onions into the green bean mixture itself.  This will definitely become one of our holiday staples.

I made this recipe a little different than the instructions but I am sure the original is just as good- if not better.  I used boiled fresh green beans, added a clove of diced garlic at the end of sauteeing the onion(before adding the flour to be sure they were good and soft), used crushed saltines instead of buttery crackers, and did not have sour cream so used 4 oz cream cheese and 1/2 - 3/4 cup of milk until I got the right consistency of sauce.  It was so amazingly rich and cheesy, I loved it.  Thanks for this recipe, it will be my go-to recipe for green bean casserole from now on.

Thank you to the provider of this recipe! I just made it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit--my husband, who doesn't even normally like green bean casserole, said that out of the 30 or so variations he has tried over the years (BTW, he's an ex-chef), this is by far the best. Excellent!!!

Brought this for Thanksgiving 2011, to a crowd of 28 people. All 28 were pleasantly surprised with a new rendition on the old tradition of green bean casserole! I left out the diced onions, but it was ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR. THANK YOU!

I really enjoyed this.  I sauteed the onions, doubled the recipe, and added one can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of 1 cup of sour cream.  I used half the cheese.  It was devoured for Thanksgiving.

Yummy!  We love the regular "soup mix" recipe, but this was even better!  I love having another option besides the french fried onions (although I like those, too).

I made this for Thanksgiving for about 50 people, they all loved it. The only things I did differently is that I added the fried onions instead of the cracker crumbs and that I cooked the onions while I melted the butter.

This was a nice change and is better than the soup version.  I did add a handful of bacon bits and slivered almond.  A half teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder.  I used fried onions because I love them.  But even without the additions the sauce was good, I just like to embellish.  I thing this will be my regular recipe now.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. The only thing is that I made it at home, covered it and then drove for an hour and ten minutes. By the time we sat down to eat, the topping wasn't crunchy, it was moist. Next time, I'll save the baking step for my destinations home (my mom's house). By the way, I'm not a greenbean fan at all...but I loved this.

This was really tasty. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except:

- Sauteed the onion first before adding anything else
- Used fresh green beans (which probably doesn't matter much)
- mixed Frenchs fried onions with the cracker topping, and topped with more onions after serving.

This tastes wayy better than the cream of mushroom soup version.

I've been using this green bean recipe for years with a couple minor changes.  I usually add a bit more sugar (about 2 tsp) and I use corn flakes and butter instead of the cracker topping.  Regardless, it's a keeper and this is the recipe my family requests!

Yum! This was so good! I used to not like green beans but fell in love with green bean casseroles & this is by far the best! I didn't use an onion & used regular canned green beans because that is what I had on hand so I am sure it is even better with the correct ingredients.

The only crackers I had in the cupboard was Triscuits. I coarsely crumbled them and mixed with the butter. It was really good... they stayed a little crunchy which was nice.

Love this recipe! I actually sauté garlic and the onions in a separate pan and then add them to the dish as instructed. I also add some of the cheese into the mix. My family loves this and even those who aren't green bean lovers eat it up!

Not my favorite. To many ingredients, they cancelled each other out. Sometimes the simple ones are the best. green beans, cream of mushroom soup garlic powder, cheddar cheese and french fried onions. Great every time...

I followed the other reviewer's advice and decreased the sour cream to 3/4c, the salt by half, and mixed half the cheese in with beans. It was still VERY cheesy, and I'm a cheese lover...so next time I will cut the cheese down to save the unnecessary calories.

Best green bean casserole I've ever had!  SO much better than the cream of mushroom soup variety - and I always loved that one, too!  I teach a high school cooking class and one of our groups made this... even the students who said they usually didn't like green beans liked this.  So I made it for my family at home and they all loved it, too!

I made this for Christmas dinner. Used fresh green beans, but other than that followed the directions to the T. Everyone loved them and so did I. What I mostly love is with the exception of the cracker topping I know exactly what is in this dish. No cans of mushroom soup, no 'fried onion' toppings. It's real food. I like that. No, I love that! Is part of the tradition now. Thank you!

A very tasty dish and more interesting than the traditional version!  I've made this twice now and found that I need a little more butter and when making the cracker crust I used an entire roll of crumbled crackers to evenly cover the top.  I also add a layer of cheese in the middle of the beans in addition to the top layer.  It all comes out quite yummy and everyone in the house loved it.  I kept all the other ingredient sizes the same as the recipe.

This dish is amazing. I made non veggie lovers huge fans. The only altercations I made were that I used frozen green beans, I added in some French Fried Onions to the Ritz crumbles, and I also tossed in some bacon bits to the mixture in the pan. Always a request!

Best ever green bean casserole recipe,  I added the shredded cheddar in with the beans as well.  My kids (who are young men) and my husband raved over these.  We have had many green bean casseroles and this is the BEST!

I like green beans and my kids do too but I usually put them in a crock pot with chicken stock and onion mix for 2 hours so I thought I would try a different way. Sorry, none of us cared for this recipe.

Very tasty.  I don't like the traditional green bean casserole.  It was a hit at my Thanksgiving table.

This was "ok". Made this for Thanksgiving this year. It wasn't a huge hit. The topping was very hard. I like the recipe off of the campbells cream of mushroom, lol.

Super easy and delicious - I had followed a previous reviewers advice and added a large can of french fried onions - The next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I'll either use a small can or omit those entirely, as it was a big too onion-y for me with the large can.

This turned out great. I followed other members comments and added cheese to the top and more bread crumbs. I also added fried onions to the top for crunch and flavor. Delicious recipe, veery easy to make... perfect side dish for the holidays!

LOVE this recipe!  Instead of the buttery crackers I used the fried onion bits from French's. Its delicious and much better than the recipe on the back of the French's can.  I will be making this recipe for every Thanksgiving!

This is just phenomenal.  I didn't change anything in this recipe, nor would I.  The sour cream base is better than the standard cream of mushroom.  Plus I love the Ritz crackers crumbled up better than the standard French Onion which can really make it salty.  Huge hit which I intend to keep making for Thanksgiving every year.

Yummy! This is so stinking good. I usually only make it for two family holidays, but I crave it 365 days a year. By the way, I use reduced or fat free on everything and it still tastes like it has all the fat and then some. I also saute the onions before starting step two, because I sure do love a sauteed onion.

I took this to my families Thanksgiving, and they all said it was good. But, they said that it just didn't have the "Thanksgiving" flavor that they are used to. I would say that there is just oo much cheese in the recipe. Next time I try this, I will only put 1/2 c. shredded cheese in the green bean pixture, and none on top. Only crushed ritz crackers or fried onions.

We made a gluten free version by substituting rice flour for the all purpose flour and for the topping you use FunYums which are gluten free.  We mixed the cheese in instead of putting it on top but also put a little bit extra on the top.  Everyone said they liked it better then the mushroom  soup version and we liked the Funyums even better then the standard french fried onions.  We'll stick to this version from now on.

Simply Amazing! Easy to make... Just added 1/2 cup of half and half (creamer) to make it creamier.. Also, added a 1/4 cup of silvered almonds for texture... Sprinkled freshley grated Romano and Parmesan cheese to the top.. Yummo! Will make again.

Absolutely delicious. I never likes green bean casserole until I had this green bean casserole. I have to agree with other reviews, definitely use fresh green beans (to make it easy on you just buy the bag that's cut up and cleaned already). I steamed them in the microwave real quick because I ran out of space on the stove, then followed the recipe. So good! Will be making again and again!

Tried this recipe looking for an alternative to the standard canned soup casserole.  The family agreed that the soup version is much better - calling this one "sour cream green beans" (which is what it tastes like).  I will play around with this recipe as the base, but for this year, it will be the tried and true recipe.

This recipe is fabulous! I've searched for a green bean casserole that does NOT call for any type of mushrooms/mushroom soup or french fried onions. I just made this today to try it out before Thanksgiving - and I just can't stop eating it!! We are onion lovers so I used 1/2c onion, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. I'm not sure if Allen's is a regional (southern) brand, but I used Allen's seasoned Italian cut green beans which are by far the best canned green beans around - they're so flavorful. Don't hesitate about making this recipe. It's amazing!!!

I used fresh beans and cooked the onions before mixing them in. My only complaint is that its a bit to salty. Next time I will cut the salt in half. If it wasn't for the saltiness it would have come out perfect.

This came out very well, even with cutting back to 1 tablespoon on the butter.  I used a combination of cheese and fried onions for the topping.

This was a big hit with my family especially my husband who hates green beans. I used the crumbled up crackers on one side and French Fried Onions on the other. The onions gave it more flavor I thought.

I prepared the dish as per the recipe, and it was very quick and easy to make, with very little clean up.  Next time I make this dish, I'll try and mix the cheese in like others have suggested, and I think I'd use the can of French fried onions instead of the crackers.

This was really good. I didn't have crackers, so I used chow mein noodles and cheerios! Strange, but it worked! I used the food processor to grind both of them up. My kids say they would eat it again.

With the high reviews I was greatly disappointed. I prefer fresh green beans, they have better taste and texture than canned french style. Also the only thing better than fried onion rings from a can is taking time to dip in buttermilk and dredge and fry your own.

I love this green bean casserole for a change of pace.  My husband likes the old kind with fried onions and cream of mushroom soup but he still ate this one.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all.  I love this casserole and will continue to make it for myself and maybe get him to like it too.

Delicious!  Best ever!  I've never made green bean casserole before until my family asked me to make it last Thanksgiving.   I always thought the recipes w/ mushroom soup were bland.  So I tried this one.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!!!!  The only change I made was I sprinkled French's fried onion rings on top.  Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Even my picky eater son liked it!  :)

Yum. I made the night before and took it to my in-laws house for dinner. I put half the cheese in the mix and saved to other half to put on top right before throwing it in the oven. Also doubled the crumb topping. Worked great to make in advance (except topping). Everyone loved it.

I made this for our family Christmas get together.  Not a spoonful left!  So delicious!  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe.  Next time I will not add the teaspoon of salt because it was a bit too salty for me.  I think the cheese and crackers add plenty of saltiness!  I WILL make this again!

This is a winner! I have always been a big fan of green bean casserole, but have found most of them to have too watery a consistency. This was the reason my husband told me this year that he did not want me to make a casserole for Thanksgiving, because he didn't like the usual Campbell's Soup recipe. I was determined to find a recipe he would like, and this is it! The sauce is thick, creamy and flavorful, but not overpowering to the beans. I used canned green beans, and added french fried onions and a little cheddar cheese to the sauce. Everyone raved over it at Thanksgiving, even my mother in law, who is a fabulous cook, asked for my recipe! :) Will definitely be using this again and again!

This was a SENSATION at a Christmas party I made it for. I did end up adding French fried onions (at the request of my husband) as well as using the butter crackers and instead of cutting back on the sour cream as some sugested, I simply added an extra can of green beans, and I think I could have easily added another with it remaining deliciously creamy. This strategy worked great and allowed for more servings! I also sauteed the onions as some suggested. All in all, this recipie was a huge success on my very first attempt, and got eaten up extremely fast!

It was edible, but I didn't think it was nearly as good as the usual green bean casserole I make, it was too thick, and just wasn't what I expected.

This recipe was a good starting point for me.  I read through reviews and made a few changes of my own too.  First, I sauteed 3 sliced strips of bacon in my pan, then added some sliced cremini mushrooms to sautee.  When they were soft and brown, I made a well in the middle and added my butter and flour for the thickener.  I then stirred in the salt, sugar, chopped dried onion, sour cream, and about 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  I added about 1 1/2 quart jars of green beans (from my family's garden that they can).  Tossed to coat and then added 1 cup of the shredded sharp cheddar, also stirring to distribute.  Poured into a 9x13 dish, topped with remaining cheese and crackers.  Baked in a 375 oven for about 20 minutes.  Came out great and it was one of the most eaten dishes at our Thanksgiving dinner!

This dish was very good, but I think the sour cream flavor was a little strong. I think next time I make it, I will use half sour cream and half cream soup... the topping really made the dish. I will make it again!

Very good dish.  I served it at Christmas.  Use only 1 cup of cheese, 2 is too much.  I wouldn't normally say too much cheese, however...1 cup is enough. :)

This is was much better than the cream of mushroom soup version. Tart the first day and by 2nd day much better. This would be better if made the day ahead and add the cracker crumbs the day you cook it. Will try again.

This was very tasty! We made it as part of our Christmas meal and it was very very good! I used fresh green beans instead of canned, also I sauteed the onions with garlic and the garlic added a subtle flavour into the mix! I did what others had suggested and mixed half of the cheese with the beans then sprinkled the rest on top!! Will be making it again! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!!!

This was a great alternative to the classic (yet unappealing) campbell's green bean casserole.  I thought the sauce mixture blended well with the green beans without giving the the over-salted instant casserole flavor you get with cream of mushroom soup.  I think two cups of cheese is a little excessive for this (adding that much cheese to a casserole this small just means there's a lack of flavor and the dish needs cheese to cover it up) and would recommend doubling it if you want to feed ten people with it. A good modification would be to omit the cheese on top and only include maybe 3/4 c. in the filling.

I tried this for Thanksgiving as an alternative from the traditional casserole, especially after seeing all the great reviews.  This was a bust, not very good.  I followed the recipe to a tee, and did not add as much salt, and the flavor was not right at all.  I won't be trying this again.

Hooray - a change from the icky fried onion casseroles!  I sauteed the onions with some garlic in a bit of olive oil, added fresh green beans and then added the flour mixed with the other dry ingredients (halved the salt as others suggested), leaving out the butter entirely.  I used fat free sour cream, fat free shredded cheddar, and low-fat Ritz crackers.  I will probably use reduced fat cheese next time, as the fat free does not melt very nicely.

Disappointing.  I thought it had too much sour cream and way too much cheese.  The texture was just wrong.  It tasted OK, but I can't understand why this is getting such high ratings.  I will not make this again.

This has got to be one of the BEST recipe I've made thus far. The only two minor changes that I made was I used FRESH green beans (par-boiled) & then once the green beans were coated with the ingredients from the skillet, I transferred it all into a bowl and mixed in the two cups of cheddar cheese--this allowed for a nice cheesy goodness with EVERY bite! The buttery cracker crust is definitely a heavenly touch.  My family went to bed fantasizing about this particular dish, just to wake up and have it for breakfast the next morning--this was the ONLY reason they didn't finish off during Thanksgiving dinner....enjoy!

followed hints from reviewers, sauteed onions till soft before adding flour and added about a cup of cheese to green bean mixture in addition to cheese called for.  also added about 2 tbsp of minced garlic and about a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes to onions while sauteeing.  WONDERFUL!

When I was asked to bring the green bean casserole for Thanksgiving I cringed! Not being a fan of the mushroom soup version I was thrilled to find this recipe. Only made minor changes and some extra seasonings. It was a hit! I plan on taking it to my husband's family Thanksgiving on Sunday!

This was phenomenal, I ate less stuffing so that I could eat EXTRA VEGGIES! Yum!  The only thing I changed was on half of the dish I did the crispy onions on top and I preferred that half over the cracker side.  They added flavor dimension and extra texture as well.  Everyone RAVED!

I have been making this for years now! Every year it is the first question I am asked at Thanksgiving.."Are you making the green beans??" Once you make these you will never want the "other" green beans again!

I absolutely love this recipe. Such a nice change from cream of mushroom soup types. The sour cream and onions give it a really great flavor. I make this for every holiday. I just add extra cheese on the top since we are big cheese lovers. Delicious!

Good but slightly bland. I will make again but maybe add some garlic salt or paprika, just needed a little something else. I did like it better than the usual cream of mushroom soup/french fried onion stuff though.

Simply fantastic as it is - I've been making this recipe for a few months now to fully try it out before I reviewed it. Very flavorful, and the sour cream is definitely the trick to making green bean casserole! I do add french fried onions to the top along with the crackers, just to give it that extra oomph!

This is hands down the best green bean casserole I have ever made! I will serve this year after year at holiday events.  The only thing I changed was I used fried onions and about half the cheese.  I added the fried onions in place of the regular onions and then I spread a thin layer of them over the top before I added the cheese.  It was amazing!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit! I'm no fan of the typical green bean casserole but even those who are die hard fans loved it! I cut back on salt and flour, delish. Never again will I make the old stand by!

This was a hit at Christmas dinner.  I did add some onions and mushrooms and sauted them in the butter before adding the flour.  I also added some french fried onins to the casserole(1can) and some to the topping (1 can) for texture.  Great!

We had this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was great. I used 2 bags of frozen french cut green beans and mixed half of the cheese in with the beans. We sprinkled extra cheese and french fried onions on top. I baked it in a 200 degree oven while we were at church and then turned the heat up to 350 for about 20 minutes while we got the rest of the food on the table. It is a new favorite.

I loved this recipe and so did the others who ate it!  I followed the recipe EXCEPT I used fresh green beans (3 lbs), blanched them and french cut them in my food processor, then followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was perfect!!  Absolutely delicious and WAY better than the cream of mushroom type casserole!

Excellent.  The only thing I did differently is to add the french fried green beans to the bean mix and the topping (with extra butter for the topping to compensate.) Fantastic taste.

EXCELLENT recipe!  We used a little less sour cream and cheese and sauteed the onions a little while before continuing, but overall this is excellent and much better than the "cream of mushroom soup/ french fried onions" typical recipe!

I was looking for a different recipe than the usual green bean casserole in cream of mushroom soup, and found this one. I used thawed-from-frozen, french-cut green beans instead of canned. Will make this again!!

I found this recipe on Allrecipes.com about 4 years ago. I will NEVER make it the old way again. This is far better than the cream soup version everyone uses. I have had constant requests to make this and crave it year round.

I didn't like the taste of this at all.  You have to be a sour cream fan, and I'm not.  I thought with all the positive reviews this would be yummy despite the sour cream, but no.

I used about 3/4 sour cream, sauteed the onions before adding, and used about twice the amount of Ritz cracker topping.  It was very good, and it was the one dish that got completely eaten, though I think I prefer it with cream of mushroom soup, which adds a bit more flavor.  I think I would also do a half cracker, half fried onions version instead.

Great dish...the only thing I did different was to saute the onions first and then set aside. I then made the Rue in the same pan as not to lose any flavor. I like it the original way but my family doesn't like biting into the onions so I compromised.

Like some others, I thought this recipe lacked just a little something.  I also thought it was weird to make a rue only to add sour cream to it. I fried up a few strips of bacon to crumble into it, and also added about a 1/2 can of cream of celery soup also.  They added just a little something to this recipe, and everyone raved about it!!! Can't wait to make it again this Thanksgiving!!

I liked this even though my husband said said it was a thumbs down.  I might decrease the amount of sour cream next time and see if he likes it any better.

Doubled the recipe.. I made some alterations as per the suggestions of other reviewers. I decreased the sour cream slightly, but then discovered that by doing that I wasn't really left with something that had enough sauce, in my opinion. I added tablespoons of half and half to make it creamier, and enough sour cream until it didn't seem so dry. I used fresh steamed green beans and mixed half of the cheese in with the beans. The other half I put on top with a full can of French fried onions. I also tossed some cooked bacon in there too. I guess I made a lot of adjustments, but kept the spirit of the dish! I barely had any leftovers from a dinner of only 6!

This is a nice change from the cream of mushroom version. For Thanksgiving, I didn't change a thing. Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers. Earlier this week, I made a lower fat version by cutting the butter down to 1 tablespoon, using light sour cream and 1/2 cup reduced fat cheese (versus 2 c full fat cheese). It was still very good and probably half the fat. Definite keeper.

Not good!  Too much cheese--completely overpowered the beans.  I was very disappointed.  If you like the beans in green bean casserole, this is not for you.

Will never make the mushroom soup version again!  This was fabulous! Along with the buttered crumbled crackers I mixed in crushed fried onions for the topping.  I mixed the cheese in with the beans, and it was delicious!  Will use fresh/frozen beans next time for sure.  Thank you!!

We did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh green beans.  No one could eat more than a bite of this.   Next year I will go with the traditional green bean casserole for thanksgiving.

I gotta tell you.. I have been getting RAVE reviews on this casserole for years now and I HAD to post a review.

I love the recipe as it is, but I've definitely made some adjustments.. first..

I use frozen french cut beans. I saute my onions in the butter first, then add the rest of the ingredients with no reductions when the beans defrost.. the extra flour is absorbed.

I also add extra cheese and some of the crackers to the beans... I love the crunch that comes from that and the sauce it produces is marvelous

U can make this ahead and let it sit.... it only takes 30 minutes to heat, and the kitchen smells MARVELOUS while its cooking. 

My family asks me to bring this to EVERY function we have. I love that even the kids will eat this!

Well, we had an early Thanksgiving day this weekend and I have to give this one a 5 stars. Even the kids liked it. It was all gone by the end of the meal!!! My son even said it was the best part!! What!!!??? I cried, but he made up by clarifying "of the sides that is" I brined the turkey with a brine recipe from this site and that was the best part :), but this side really made the spotlight. I don't like green beans casserole at all and neiher the kids, however, for some reason I always end up making it, just as part of the Thanskgiving a tradition and it always goes to waste!!!!! Not this time. I added a few small dollops of light cream of chicken soup and used Fat free sour cream, I used fresh green beans and added an extra can of french style canned beans. Delish and now I can have a light dish for poultry, fish etc. Thanks for the recipe!
Update: Just to say I am printing this again. It is now a tradition on our Christmas/Thanksgiving dinners and Kids request it ALL the time as odd as that sounds!!!! Then say YUM!!!

Very good Amy. Didn't see the need for the sugar and I used fresh green beans. I had to opt out on the crackers and still use the traditional fried onions because we all love them. Different and loved by everyone. Thanks!

A worthy alternate to the standard cream of mushroom recipe!
I sauteed the onion in a bit of olive oil before mixing in with the butter/flour mixture, and layered the cheddar in the beans, as opposed to putting it all on top.  I also used a bit of french-fried onions throughout - YUM!

I printed this recipe off this site a few years ago and it has been a staple at every Thanksgiving and Christmas meal I make.  I hate green beans in general, but I love these.  It's so quick and easy and I make it a day in advance so all I have to do on the holiday is throw it in the oven to bake!  Everyone raves about these green beans and my uncle (who owned a restaurant at the time) told me they were the best green beans he's ever had.

I made a few adjustments and served this at an event for 280 women.  They raved about it. Many of them spent the evening trying to figure out what was in it. The adjustments were adding diced red and yellow bell peppers. I have also made this in smaller amounts and have used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack cheese.  Gives it a little kick if that is what you like!

We all love green bean casserole, but this recipe didn't seem to please anyone at our table.  The flavor was okay, but we wouldn't make it again.  Way too much cheese, and not crunchy at all.

This is very good.  We stuck to the recipe to try it out for our upcoming Thanksgiving dinner.  The crackers don't seem like they'll be enough, but they really go a long way.  It's very "sour creamy", so I would cut back on that.  We diced our onion into VERY small pieces to avoid undercooking, and it turned out great.  I did miss some of that mushroom soup flavor, but this was a wonderful alternative.  For the real Thanksgiving dinner we'll use fresh green beans instead of canned, and less sour cream.  Great recipe!

For some reason I have always loved Green Bean Casserole but hated mushroom.  Four years ago I found this recipe and have used it every Thanksgiving and even throughout the year.  Haven't changed a thing except I use the french onions to top instead of crackers.  Thanks!!!!

This is a staple in our house during the cooler months. I do increase the amount of green beans for a less saucy finished product and I like to grate the onion instead of dicing it. It provides a more sublime onion flavor without getting big pieces mixed in with the beans.

Great casserole, wasn't a drop left. Only changes were I used half sour cream and half cream of chicken soup. And I sprinkled All-bran cereal on top in place of the cracker crumbs without  butter. Very tasty.

This is the third time I've made this recipe, and it's always a hit w/ the entire family.  Some changes: I add paprika, about 1/2 tsp, and once, when I didn't have any onions, I used frozen chopped broccoli, and have been told to use it each time.  Great recipe!

I did not tell anyone that I was bringing a green bean casserole to Easter dinner for fear of objections.  However, after everyone tasted this recipe, all fear was gone.  This is the best green bean casserole that I have ever tasted.  Make it exactly like the recipe.  It's terrific!

We had an event at our B&B and used this recipe. It was a great hit. We didn't add fried onions to it. We made it exactly as it appears in the recipe. I loved the fact that we could make it in advance, cover it and put it in the refridgerator overnight. Make sure and let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. You'll love it! Great taste!!

Made this twice now, always works out rockin'! The sour cream in the mix is just about the only new thing you can do to a traditional green bean casserole, and it's wonderful! I added parmesan cheese to the fried onion and crumbled crackers, and that was even better. Still, really great!

Great recipe.  I used frozen beans instead of canned, so my suggestion would be to definately cook them before adding to the mixture.  Otherwise this was excellent and will replace the traditional green bean casserole!

I used half the sour cream called for and half can cream of mushroom soup.  I also used a small can of the Durkee fried onions in addition to the buttered crackers.  Very very good!!

I have made this several times and ONLY for thanksgiving :). My family loves it! I usually make a little extra "sauce" or you could just put less green beans.

We've been using this recipe at our family Thanksgiving for years now and everyone loves it!  I recently made it for some friends, and they have now requested it instead of birthday cake!  Wonderful recipe, but I use French Fried Onions as a topping instead of Ritz Crackers.

Weird taste. I followed the recipe exactly. A little too salty tasty, and not enough flavor. Next time i will cut back on the salt, use 1/2 can cream of  anything, and use parmesan, or something a bit more creamy, not so harsh like cheddar.

I did a trial run on this recipe yesterday and found it to be a very tasty and savory side dish.  I couldn't stop eating it!  The only change I made was that I used onion powder instead of onions since my daughter won't eat anything with real onion.  It turned out fabulously.  A keeper!

INCREDIBLE!!!  I've always loved GBCasserole, but I always thought it tasted like soup out of a can.  This was so amazing.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Everyone in my family said they will never make the "can" version again.  And I wasn't sure about the cheese and cracker topping because I absolutely love the onions, but I actually liked this a lot better.  I was shocked.  I just thought I'd "try it" and it is definitely my recipe now!

This recipe was great!  It was the only "green" anything on our thanksgiving table and EVERYONE loved it.  Since I had read ONE bad review of this recipe that said the dish was not too big on flavor I added a little more salt and also the juice of one small lemon along with the smallest amount of microplaned lemon zest on top.  I also used fresh green beans that I boiled, for about 7 minutes, until they were about 3/4 of the way done. Thanks Amy!

This was tasty, and I liked it because it didn't use the canned cream soup (I hate that stuff).  I used fresh steamed green beans (about 1.5 lbs).  It was almost too rich though.  I think it was the buttery round crackers on top that sent it over the top.  Good addition to the Thanksgiving table though, and I'm glad I tried it!

This recipe was definitely a favored alternative to the traditional green bean casserole.  I had some Velveeta cheese on hand and grate that for the top.  I made a huge portion for a small gathering, and I could NOT stop eating this.  Everyone raved about it.  My husband, who has an aversion to green beans really like this recipe! Thank you!

the best i have ever had! my husband agreed and neither of us are green bean casserole fans. this is best served piping hot as the cheese is best when melted. the 1st time i made it, it had too much sour cream, the 2nd time i made it with 3/4 the sour cream, and it was perfect!

I've made this 4 times since August for family gatherings and have had about a dozen requests for the recipe from people that weren't at any of them.  I found that it's very easy to double everything and bake in a 9 X 13 stoneware cake pan.  I even made it with reduced fat sour cream and no one noticed a difference. At the first get-together, I made one casserole of the classic onion version and one of this.  Without a doubt, this was the favorite.

This casserole was very good.  The only thing I changed was to use saltine crackers instead of ritz-tpye ones.  I think next time I would use half as much cheese and twice as many crackers.  The gooey chesse on top was a little overwhelming.  Other than that, very yummy!

I tried this recipe for Christmas because 2 of my guests do not eat cream of mushroom soup.  It turned out very good!  I may try putting some french onions in the topping next time to give it a little more crunch.

I cooked this fot my church for a Wednesday night dinner and it was a big hit!!!!  I made enough for 125 and I did not have any left.  I used the super large size regular cut green beans instead of french style and I completely omitted the salt.  I added garlic powder to the mix and I added garlic salt to the cracker crumbs.  I used 5# sour cream and 5# cheddar cheese to 4 super size cans green beans.  I also sauteed the onions in butter and I did not use any flour at all.  It was thick enough without it.  I will prepare this again.  Thanks

Very quick and easy and extremely tasty. The ideal green bean casserole for a busy dinner with many guests. My experience though - having made it yesterday for 9 people (6 adults and 3 children) - is that it yields only 8 servings rather than the 10 servings. Or my guests were especially hungry! If I made it again I would probably calculate the ingredients a little more generously. Other than that: a certain winner. Even my mother-in-law asked for the recipe!

This dish was delicious!! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! We ate all of it, even my children loved it. The taste of the sour cream with the cheddar cheese and topping was fabulous. I did use regular cut green beans, from the can and it tasted yummy. I think next time I may try fresh green beans. Thanks Amy! I now have a new green bean favorite!

This was great!  I made it to bring to my parents' house for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a hit!  I added more sour cream (but my family and I LOVE sour cream, probably more than the average person).  I also mixed most of the cheese in with the sour cream and beans.  I also added garlic salt, which was not a the best idea, because it made it a bit on the salty side, for my taste.  Next time I will not add any salt and use either fresh garlic cloves or garlic powder.  But I will definitely be making this one again and again!  Fast, easy and delicious!!

This recipe is the best!!!  Like some of the suggestions, I mixed half the cheese in the green bean mixture.  On one side I used the crackers and one side I used french fried onions.  Everyone preferred it with the french fried onions!!!  This recipe is the greatest we all have ever tasted!!!

Just have to let everyone know--this is still 5 Stars in our book! It's a "must" for family gatherings. They request it by name. It’s so much better than the traditional variety. First, I like using the French cut beans. Second, I hate cream of mushroom soup. Third, butter and flour make a better sauce than canned soup any day! If you find yours “lacking” then add some seasonings (I personally love Mrs. Dash).  I've made it for two Thanksgivings in a row and am looking forward to this year! Usually, I omit the cheese in this recipe because I forget that it calls for it (yes, I have this memorized). I use fried onions, so I think that no one notices any lack of flavored toppings. Boy, “Grandma" was a GREAT cook!

Well, I can't really comment on the kid factor, as I served it to adults.  But it was a huge hit at my work's holiday party.  I think I definitely prefer this to the standard mushroom soup/onion version.  A new favorite for me!  I did add a few more crackers to the top, about 4.

A big hit with my family on Thanksgiving. They even forgave me for not bringing the old and popular greenbean casserole dish.  They even made me promise to bring this one next year!

The sour cream made this so yummy!  I used french-fried onions instead of the crackers on top.  I also mixed in the cheddar cheese as has been suggested in some of the reviews.  My whole family loved this--it has been added to my holiday recipe collection!

I served this for the first time (without even trying the recipe first) this Thanksgiving. It was GREAT! It was the only dish that we didn't have any leftovers - everyone loved it.

I have never made (or had) green bean casserole before, but I was asked to make one for my new boyfriend's 40 relatives this Thanksgiving. It was easy to make, even with a GALLON of green beans! Everyone loved it, especially the kids, and all of the grandmothers have asked for the recepie!  Thanks Amy!

I have to agree with everyone! This recipe is wonderful, not to mention quick, easy and inexpensive. It was a "HIT" at our family's Thanksgiving feast and everyone was asking for the recipe. Look forward to preparing it again for any occasion!

Thanks for sharing!
Irene...

Made this for Thanksgiving 2001..it was a huge hit, but I used 4 cans of greenbeans instead of 3, and probably increased the ingredients a tad overall just to stretch it out..my husband loved it!  Easy to prepare, and I agree, mixing in the cheese with the bean mixture and then sprinkling some on top with the crackers was a great thing!

I made this last Christmas and it was a hit! I grew tired of the standard cream of mushroom and fried onion green bean bake. This recipe really mixes things up and the sour cream adds a whole new dimension of flavor. Because we’re in Texas, I add diced jalapeño pepper and diced fresh garlic to the diced onion mixture and sauté for a few minutes...really brings out the good flavor without the harsh burn associated with the jalapeño.

This recipe is dangerous. I used fresh beans and added cooked chicken so I could use it as a main dish. I didn't want to stop eating it.

I always make the traditional -- with cr of mushroom soup.  BUT!  I'm just about the only one that eats it!  So....tried this out today.  We added some crumbled French fried onions and cheese into the mix...then topped with more of both...plus the crushed buttered ritz.  Hubby loves it!  Thinking of trying some bacon bits next time.  thanks for the alternative!

No changes needed here. I LOVE this recipe and sometimes make 2 batches because I know I want one all to myself. It is so much better than the can soup casseroles!

Entire family loved this. So glad I took the risk and made this instead of the mushroom soup one I've made for years. Took other's advice and sautéed onion in the butter first, mixed in half of the cheese and put the other half on top, and added 50% more cracker crumb topping. I'll make this again and again! Thank you for sharing this recipe Amy!

I did not expect this! I thought the cream of mushroom soup green bean casserole was awesome. This is like 100x better. I was a little hesitant for the crackers and no soup, but it came together amazingly! I told my husband we will have to make this throughout the year! It was a big hit at the in-laws too. I made a 8x13 and 3/4 of it was gone, I was hoping I would have more leftovers of my new favorite side dish!

This was much better than the traditional canned soup and French fried onion way but I would make the following changes:
Cook onions first
Fresh green beans
Stir all cheese into beans
Assemble the day before and add 12 Ritz crackers on top instead of 9 right before baking.

I followed the recipe, with the canned french green beans - the only difference was I added more cheddar cheese to the top. I was pretty underwhelmed with this recipe, it was bland and I didn't like the melted cheese - it made the dish feel really heavy and greasy - which is an abomination for me to say because I am a cheese addict. I think I'll try it again with fresh green beans as other posters suggested and a better more flavorful cheese (using less this time), but to rate the recipe as is I give it 2 stars.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody LOVED IT!!! This has now been requested to be at every family holiday feast even when we are traveling across states! I did tweak this recipe just a bit. First, I get fresh green beans and cut them and then steam them. I use 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1.5 teaspoons garlic powder with the sugar. I then use 1/2 container of French Fried Onions crushed instead of a regular onion. Add the entire cup of sour cream and about 1 cup of the cheddar cheese. Mix the green beans to coat and then transfer into greased casserole dish. I layer with more cheddar cheese and then I mix crushed ritz crackers and the other 1/2 of the French Fried Onions crushed together for the topping. Don't forget to add the melted butter to the top (I use 2 tablespoons vs 1 because of how much topping I put on). Delicious and easy recipe!

Try at lest once if you like the classic green bean casserole.
I only gave it 4 stars because not the whole family loved it. We are very classic green bean casserole lovers.
I've made it twice now the only big difference was I added the crispy fried onions instead of the cracker and butter mixture and added pepper. This time I made it with carmelized sliced onions and and a whole clove of garlic which I just cooked with the onions and took out before I mixed it all. 
I loved it and it satisfies my cravings for green bean casserole.

I make this recipe every time.  I do not care for the original green bean casserole with mushroom soup.  I do add the French fried onion to the cracker mixture.  Also saute onions and garlic before mixing veggies with sauce!  I am going to saute the onions with a few bacon pieces before adding the rest of ingredients!

I only made this because I had everything on hand and wanted to make a green bean casserole. Thought cheese on green beans sounded strange. It was excellent! I've been making the standard green beans/cream of mushroom/french fried onion version for years, but I'm not sure I'll ever make that one again now that I have this. Only thing I changed was to use panko (Japanese bread crumbs) instead of cracker crumbs just because that's what I had.

Recipe was a big hit! I sauteed the onions with the butter until soft, then added the rest of the ingredients but I also added some milk to make it more of a thick sauce, I mixed the green beans in and then put in the a casserole dish and mixed some cheese and cheese on top. Came out perfect!

I make this several times a year.  I feel so lucky that we found this recipe, because one of my relatives really worries about the amount of sodium in canned soup.  But from the very first time we made this, everyone like it so much better.  I put in more onions because we love the real onions in it, but also use the crispy onions.  Great recipe.

This is by far the best Green Bean Casserole recipe that I’ve ever had. I’ve been making this for Thanksgiving for the last 4 years and my family loves it. I do add a little more crackers crumbs though, but you don’t have to.

Much better than the standard with cream of mushroom soup! Light and flavorful! 

Easy to make a day ahead. I waited to put the crushed crackers on top until July before putting it in the oven. I added a few fried onions on top!

Delicious! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and mixed in most of the cheese saving just enough for the topping. I also snuck in 1 tsp lemon pepper. I was looking for a casserole that does not use soup and still tastes good and I found it. Thank you!

I used freshly sliced and steamed green beans. My family loved it. I refuse to used processed foods like French fried onions in a can. This was a wonderful and healthier (and tastier) alternative. My daughter demanded her green bean casserole her aunt usually makes (processed...see above), but was thrilled to have this tastier and healthier version.

After this recipe, I will never go back to canned green beans and fried onions. Delish! I used a raw onion, frozen green beans and diced bacon. The trick is to making a rue with the butter and flour. I definitely used more butter than the recipe calls for. Highly recommend!

I have never eaten or made Greenbean casserole, Everyone I know loves it and gave me the standard French Onion Mushroom Soup Recipe. As badly as I've always wanted to try Green Bean Casserole the thought of French Onions always made me cringe. Then I found this Perfect Recipe, this Dish was a HUGE hit at my Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it said it was the best they have ever had and could not believe it was my first time making the dish. This dish will always have a place at my Table, it has actually replaced macaroni and cheese.

Made this for thanksgiving dinner 2014. It was a hit! Even those that don't like the French onion/cream of mushroom version were very pleased with it. Thought I might get seconds, but it was gone before half time. GREAT RECIPE! I prepped it the night before and let it set in the fridge before the final bake.

Yes ! I love green bean casserole and gave this a try and it's a Far cry better than the cream of mushroom soup/ fried onion variety.
  The flavor was fantastic,  and even those that don't like the typical green bean casserole really liked this recipe.
 No Tweaks Necessary, recipe is great as it comes! This one is my keeper, thanks!

I have had my eye on this recipe for years, and finally decided to try it for Thanksgiving this year, rather than the standard cream of mushroom soup recipe I always make. I really liked this! I thought it was better! I made a few changes, per our family's taste. I sauteed the onion in the butter, because I don't like crunchy onion. I also added some black pepper and garlic powder to the sauce. I mixed half of the cheese into the casserole, as I always do in my regular recipe. And green bean casserole is not the same, to me, without the french fried onions. So, I mixed some into the casserole, as well as crush some into the cracker crumb crust. My 8 year old daughter loved it and gobbled it up! If I hadn't been so full after my first helping, I would have eaten seconds, and I know what I'm eating for lunch tomorrow! One thing to note for next time: I don't think it needs as much salt, so I will try using half the amount next time, but that may be because of my addition of the fried onions, which are salty anyway. In my regular recipe I also like to include water chestnuts, and I will try that next time. I loved the addition of the garlic powder, and next time I will be sure to have enough fresh garlic that I can use that instead and saute with the onion (I used the last of mine in our mashed potatoes).

This was pretty good, but I suggest a little less sour cream and mixing half the cheese with the green beans as opposed to all on top.  Was a Thanksgiving hit.

Made it this year for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it.  My brother-in-law stated it was the 'surprise hit of the evening'.  Turns out he had taken some just to be polite but ended up eating seconds.  I wasn't sure I'd like the combination of green beans and cheese but it was delicious!  I did as some others suggested and mixed half of the cheese in with the beans and put the remaining on top.  It was perfect and the one side I wish I would have doubled!

Tried this for Thanksgiving dinner, using the suggestions of others to saute the onions in the butter at the beginning.  It was delicious, the family loved it.  This is my new go-to "holiday" green bean recipe!

This is the only GBC you should ever make!  I don't use the onions most of the time b/c usually I'm running late and they give me headaches. I just use French fried onions on the top (if the onions are cooked, I don't get a headache. Migraine trigger.)  When I use the onions on top, I don't use the butter crackers. Also one of my best friends is gluten free, so the last time I made this I just excluded the flour and it worked just fine.  I make it with fresh green beans as well. I love this recipe b/c it doesn't have cream of mushroom soup in it so it's easily turned into a completely healthy, organic side dish. Sour cream = good fats! (Made from

So I was a little lazy when it came to this recipe so instead of making the roux and adding in the sour cream I used a can of cream of mushroom soup so that the casserole would be think still. I also wanted the French fried onions that were nearly impossible to find (I should have known lol) so I substituted them for the cracker crumbs. All and all I turned this into a delicious Frankenstein of a green bean casserole and I think it turned out really well. Either way, seeing as this recipe was the main inspiration I thought it necessary to rate it very highly.

LOVE this recipe. I preferred the traditional french fried onions as a topping, but otherwise it is so flavorful compared to the traditional cream of mushroom casserole.

I followed this recipe with Momma_S's modifications, see Most Helpful Review, for the most part... I did use canned French beans as I was short on time and accidentally forgot the fried French Onions. Made this on Saturday for our 1st Frendsgiving. However, it still turned out really good! I will certainly try it with fresh beans and the fried onion rings next time!

My family loved this version and they normally won't touch green bean casserole. It is also great because we have family who are allergic to mushrooms and can't have the other version. I modified this recipe by dicing the onions very fine in a mini food processor so that I wouldn't have to cook them. I also used fried onions and a 1/2 cup cheese on top. I will try other posted suggestions on my next try.

Just tried this recipe today for our early family Thanksgiving, it was a hit! I did everything as directed, except I made my own corn bread, no mix. One mistake I did make is forgetting to omit the 1/4 cup sugar called for in the corn bread recipe. In the future I may add a tablespoon or two of sugar, but not a quarter cup. In-spite of that, the dressing was delicious! I've never had corn bread stuffing before, neither has my family (we live in WI and corn bread stuffing is not a tradition our family), but we were all pleasantly surprised.

The absolute best green bean casserole I have ever had. The only changes that were made the recipe were using fresh green beans and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Oh, and putting the cheese in the sauce instead of on top.

I made substitutions because of my dietary issues: cream cheese for sourcream and omitted the sugar. I used fresh wax beans and let is cook for an hour (since the fresh are more firm). Came out excellent!!! I typically hate green bean casserole but this one I love!!!

I improvised a little on this recipe. Yunno, go through your kitchen and see what you have. Instead of canned beans i used fresh green beans from my moms garden and Panco instead of Crackers and butter..and my mom loved it! Especially the added Crunchiness the fresh beans gave. Thank you for the recipe idea. I will keep looking for more amazing ideas from allrecipies.

I make this every holiday. There is never anything left! I have resorted to making double batches and hiding one for leftovers. I do a couple things different...first I ditched the onion flakes and I use sweet onions and sauté them before adding it into the mix and second I mix the cheese throughout the mixture prior to baking. It is always a crowd pleaser!

I love this recipe!! I have always hated green bean casseroles, so when a friend of mine made this I was amazed!! I asked what he put in it (because I cannot stand cream soups of any kind and I could tell he didn't not use any). He told me about this recipe (except we both leave out the sour cream) and I have been making it ever since. Of course I make this for all my work functions, so everyone knows what they are missing by just opening a can. ;D

I was so happy to finally find a recipe for this that did not contain canned mushroom soup.

I made this for Christmas and I am making this again at the end of Jan. I had a craving and my family enjoys this very much...I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe unless to add mushrooms not the soup just mushrooms...Thank you for posting this!

I made this recipe and the "traditional" green bean casserole found on the fried onion canister for Thanksgiving.  I had everyone who eats green bean casserole try both.  Unanimously, everyone liked the traditional.  Maybe we are all creatures of habit?  I thought it was okay, but I won't be making it again.

I made this for thanksgiving this year and  EVERYONE was raving about how delicious it was and it was the only dish that didn't have any leftovers! I did follow some of the review and used 1/2 the flour and salt that is recommended. i will definitely be making this again! Thank you for the AMAZING recipe!

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving, then again for Christmas Eve with some slight changes the second time around and it was perfect. Definitely sauté the onion in the butter first.  I also reduced the cheese to 1 cup and incorporated half of that to the green bean mix and then sprinkled the rest on top. And lastly, added about 3/4 of a can of French fried onions to the cracker/butter topping.  My mother in law was just raving about it and thats a huge compliment coming from the best cook I know.  Thank you, Amy for getting us hooked!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. Used fresh green beans & added 2 cloves minced fresh garlic. I mixed in 1 cup of the cheese with the mixture, than added the other cup on top. This is by far the best green bean casserole I have had & it will become a staple at all future Thanksgiving dinners.

This was okay, on the bland side, except it tastes sour because of sour cream. It was fairly good, but then anything with this much fat tastes good without being too artful. ;)

I grew up on green bean casserole from cream of mushroom soup & french fried onions, so I wasn't expecting to love this--but I was pleasantly surprised. I made the recipe as stated and it was delicious. You could saute the onions first, use fresh green beans, or whatever else may be your preference--but I think both of those things are unnecessary. I'm not in the business of overcomplicating if I don't need to!

I don't like leaving bad reviews but I made this for Thanksgiving instead of the traditional mushroom soup recipe and sad to say, only one person liked it (out of 8).  Admittedly I used frozen cut green beans instead of french style but it really didn't have a lot of flavor.  Back to the old version that everyone liked.

This recipe hands down beats your average "green bean casserole" with canned mushroom soup. I used fresh green beans, boiled them till they were barely tender, also sautéed the onion in olive oil, I also added about 1/3 of the cheese to the bean/sour cream mixture, and I topped it with the crackers and a can of fried onions. It turned out superb, everyone loved it!!! I think next time I will try it with jack or Swiss cheese, because the sharpness if the cheddar cheese kind of took over the dish, but it was still great.  I made mine the day before, took it out and let it get to room temp that morning, and just added the topping before I put it in the oven to save time on thanksgiving.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! There was nothing left. I did as everyone else suggested and sauteed the onions first. I also used fresh green beans and steamed them. I even made this a few days before Thanksgiving and froze it. I thawed it 24 hours in advance and then popped it in the oven to reheat--sprinkled French's crunchy onions on top. Delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving because I don't like the kind with mushroom soup but was asked to bring green bean casserole. Followed others' suggestions to sauté onions and lightly steam fresh green beans first. Also added 3 turns of cracked pepper and 3/4 tsp garlic. The only change I would make next time would be to add more green beans.

My family and guests loved this dish! I did follow the advice of others and saute the onions, reduce the sour cream to 3/4 cup, and reduce the cheese to 1 1/2 cup.  Also, mixing 1/2 the cheese in with the green beans did seem to make a difference.

This was an excellent alternative to the traditional green bean casserole with cream of mushroom. It's savory, creamy and delicious. I took the advice of others and steamed some fresh green beans & then followed the directions. This is a great recipe that the family loved. It will be added to the traditional meal.

I love sour cream & cheese but we thought it was overkill - too much of a good thing that didn't add anything to this recipe.  I did like the buttery cracker topping though & will use it instead of my usual breadcrumbs.  (Don't like canned onion rings.)  My family prefers it made with a homemade sauce with extra mushrooms & fresh steamed beans.

I have been using this recipe for years now, it is the best green bean casserole I have tried. Everyone just loves this and every time I serve this to someone they always rave about it and ask for the recipe. I did not change one thing with this recipe. I was a little hesitant about using canned beans but they work just great with this recipe.

This is a great alternative to the cream of mushroom soup which I avoid due to the sodium content. The only revision I made to the recipe is that I sautéed the onions first. I also used a sharp cheddar cheese. The cracker toping was good and I used Ritz crackers. A crowd pleaser and an empty dish!

Made this for a family gathering as I wanted to try something different than the standard green bean casserole.  It was so much better than I thought it would be!  Everyone loved it!  I added some crushed fried onions to the cracker crumble mix, just to give a little more flavor.  Super easy and super tasty!!

Sauce is great, but definitely sauté onions before adding flour, etc.  I added a cut up yellow summer squash, since I was short on beans and it was a great combo.

Yummy! I made the following changes based on other's suggestions:

3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp sugar
1 tsp garlic powder
Added extra cheese (I mixed most of the cheese with the green beans & I just put a layer of cheese over the top.)

Wow!  Grandma rocks!  This is the best green bean casserole that I've ever had.  The sour cream and onions really set it off. I didn't have the crackers so I used fried onion rings and it was amazing.  This one is definitely a keeper.

My family are requested this side dish for every Sunday dinner. Tried this variation for the first time and followed the recipe as suggested. I don't see the need to change anything..suited our tastes just fine. :)

This is the same recipe that my mother-in-law typed on an old 3 by 5 card in one of those ancient hard-plastic recipe box from the early 1960's.  After upgrading the terms her old recipe became this one! I would still grate the onion, though, and collect as much onion juice from the grating for the cream sauce. It makes for a tastier flavor. Instead of cheddar cheese, try swiss cheese--it pairs MUCH BETTER with the green beans (and shredded swiss is now available at the grocer's). I like the idea of coating the green beans with the sauce in this recipe; the old recipe wanted the beans layered with the cheese, and the cream sauce poured over the top of everything. I think coating the beans with the sauce ensures better coverage.

The onions should be sauteed first and the cheese could be substituted with shredded Gruyere for a little bit of bite. Otherwise, it is good.

This was SO good!  I used frozen green beans and lightly boiled them first before mixing into the sauce. I substituted half full fat homemade yogurt instead of using the full amount of sour cream. I also used whole grain crackers in the place of the buttery round crackers.  Everything else I did as mentioned. I think using the real onions really made the dish taste much better--please don't substitute dried onions if at all possible!

I used some beans that were originally fresh, and then frozen for months....  so, essentially - frozen beans...  Turned out VERY nice.  I added garlic salt and put pepper in the mix as well.  Because I love Tabasco, I put some original Tabasco as well, SOOOOOOOO worth it!

I made this at Thanksgiving and it was the only dish that was completely gone at the end of the meal. Everyone loved it so much that the next night, when we were having leftovers of everything else, we made a second round of this and there wasn't anything left of that one either!

This was really good. I don't like the traditional recipe using crispy onions and mushroom soup. I skipped the onions here and it was tasty.

My boyfriend does not like green beans but loves this dish. I prefer it over the old green canned green beans and cream of mushroom soup recipe!  I used fresh green beans and added some chopped mushrooms and this came out beautiful! I will make this a holiday staple!

This was so good. I made made it for a Christmas party and all but one spoonful was left.  I sauteed the onions ahead like many others did.  I mixed some cheese in with the bean mixture, added some on top, then added french fried onions and then added a little bit of cheese on top.  Next time I make it I think I will put less french fried onions on top.  I will definitely make this dish again!  My husband doesn't like can veggies but loved this dish.  Will definitely make again!

Made this for Thanksgiving, and the person who requested green bean casserole liked it a lot, but some others did not.  The cracker crumbs kind of caked up into mush.  I used fresh green beans, so maybe that affected the outcome.  I think it may be important to use a large casserole or cake pan to allow the ingredients to be spread more thinly...  will try that next time.

This was an amazing success. I made thanksgiving dinner in Sweden and no one had ever tried this dish before- everyone loved it. I usually don't care for canned vegetables my self- and I loved it. Thank you for the recipe! I'll probably be making it for years to come.

This was a great recipe! I do agree to saute the onion first ,which made the recipe much better the second
time around.  Not sure how people can give a rating to a recipe that they altered.  ?? this is a great recipe
we all enjoyed.

Coming from someone who doesn't really cook. This dish was super simple, and absolutely delicious. The only thing i would change is to mix the cheddar cheese with the green beans and sour cream. And add more on top then bake :) I'm a cheese lover . I am definitely making this for Christmas this year, and many more holidays and special occasions. I really loved it , and i'm pretty sure everyone else will too. Thanks for great recipe !

This recipe saved the day for me.  I had pressure cooked fresh green beans with bacon and they tasted too bland.  So I found this recipe and happened to have the sour cream on hand.  Wow what a great difference.  It was a hit with the family at our Thanksgiving dinner. It will be a regular dish at all our holiday gatherings.

I make this recipe every year.  I have to make a double batch, as everyone loves it so much.  The only variation I do, is I add the Frenchs French Fried Onions in the cheddar flavor mixed right in the casserole.  YUM!

Oh, this is sooooo good! Cooked according to directions other than the topping. I didn't bother crumbling and measuring the Ritz. I just crushed an entire sleeve, which probably was the measure in the recipe lol. Plus I also cooked the onion down first. My husband doesn't like ANYTHING with sour cream. But he loved this. We cook this twice monthly now.

Excellent!  I just made this and have to say that I am thrilled to have a recipe for green bean casserole that uses non-pantry ingredients!  I didn't have sour cream on hand so I made a roux with heavy cream, flour & milk.  Also instead of onions I used shallots (again, what I had on hand) and once I tried the sauce, I decided to skip the cheese all together (the cheese by the way was the ingredient that first enticed me to try this recipe!)  I felt that the cheese would have been overkill and take away from the great flavors that were already there.  I don't think I'll ever use the stuff in the cans for my green been casserole ever again.  Thanks Amy & thank  your grandma too!  :o)

This will be my first time making a green bean casserole. I guess that it was successful since my husband liked it alot. However, I somewhat didn't like it. It really doesn't matter since my hubby liked it alot.

For our DAIRY FREE home, this was a great base recipe to work from!  I took some advice from other reviewers, and some tricks that I've learned to alter this recipe to fit our lifestyle.  First, I used FRESH, STEAMED Green beans.....so good!  Then, I used 2 TBSP dairy free butter alternative and sauteed one small onion.  I used 2 TBSP flour, 1 TSP white sugar, 1/2 TSP salt, 1/4 TSP black pepper, and 1 1/2 TSP garlic powder (although next time I will decrease the garlic by 1/2 tsp.).  I then used about 3/4 cup rice milk and about 1 cup of dairy free sour cream alternative.  It made a fabulous sauce!  I couldn't stop tasting it =)  I will probably use it over pasta at some point.  Then, as other readers suggested, I mixed-in the french fried onions and topped with the onions as well.  I did not use any cheese, but that's because the cheese alternatives would have altered the flavor.  But from someone who used to put cheese in EVERYTHING, now that we aren't using it, I really don't miss it.

Are 6 stars possible? I've made this for Christmas and for just everyday get-togethers and it's always one of the first things gone. It's delicious! I usually do more than just 2 cans of beans and sometimes omit the onion. This recipe is flexible. And wonderful! Thank you for it!

This dish was excellent. I had a hard time making green bean casserole without french onions, however, so I added about a cup to the casserole itself, and also sprinkled some on top to brown five minutes before taking it out of the oven. Success! Definitely putting this onto my holiday menus from now on.

This was the first time I've made this and I love this recipe!!! I made it from leftover fried green beans from the night before so they had a little extra crunch to them which was nice. Delish recipe which I will use many other times.

I used Fiber Selects in place of  "buttery round crackers." Fantastic, although I don't usually care for green beans. I will definatly make this again.

This was too labor intensive to just taste OK. I did saute the onions before adding to avoid the crunchiness other reviewers mentioned. I'll probably just stick to the old cream of mushroom soup version in the future.

I guess I just don't like canned green beans.   Maybe with fresh green beans, a lot more crackers and less sour cream it could have been better.  Not sure and not going to bother trying it again.

Ok, heres the deal. My girlfriend does the cooking normally. My grandmother used to make a great green bean casserole and I wanted to bring back that memory a little for christmas so i found this recipe. I added about 3/4 cup of cooked bacon and I only added half the amount of the required sour cream. I then added a whole regular sized can of cream of mushroom soup. I CANNOT GET HER TO LEAVE ME ALONE ABOUT THE FREAKING CASSEROLE!!! She is begging me to make this again! Oh, and we used a combination of Ritz crackers and French fried onions. I also took the recommendation of another user and sauted 1/2 cup of onion into the garlic clove and butter before adding the flour.

Love this!  Served for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews.    The only thing I did different from what was stated in original recipe was to follow others advice in saute onions with the butter.   I would recomend doing the same.

Made this for the first time on Christmas and got rave reviews.  Took suggestions from other reviews and it was a hit.  Used fresh cooked beans, added cheese to the bean mixture as well as on top.  Added Panko crumbs to the crumbled Ritz Cracker.   Making it again tonight.

Very easy and tasty.  We found it to be a nice change from the normal green bean casserole.   I cooked the onion in butter first then added the flour, salt and sugar.  I used two cans cut green beans and one can french style.  Once all mixed together I put it in the dish and covered with fried french onions.  Will make again!

This is by far the best green bean casserole I have ever had and it's as easy as the typical soup version. I have craved this since Thanksgiving and cannot wait until I get to make more for Christmas. This recipe is worth trying...you will love it. I followed it exactly except I used crunchy onions on top...next time I think I will try the crackers. Enjoy!!

Maybe it my own doing, but I wasn't too pleased with the results of this recipe. I used fresh green beans instead of canned and theat could have made the difference. It's just that the sauce turned out lumpy and the family wanted the fried onions back.

Delish!  I also sauteed the onions in the butter, added a can of mushrooms, and topped off with the fried onions.  My husband and I did not get tired of the leftovers! Will make again!

We will be using this recipe again. Delicious! And loved the fact that I don't have to use cream of mushroom soup! I used fresh green beans and steamed them beforehand so they'd be softer. Delish!

I've never had anything I made be so complimented.  Extremely flavorful, thick and not soupy, and the cheese really set it off nicely.  I used extra topping (I love crunchy stuff), but other than that I didn't change anything.  Rest assured, I'll be using this recipe for all of my Thanksgiving dinners from now on.

This was delicious! I have never had the other popular green bean casserole, so I can't compare the two, but everyone in my family was telling me not to waste my time making a green bean casserole with our Turkey dinner...but once they tasted it, everyone went back for seconds or thirds! I made a few changes: I only used 3/4 cup of sour cream, I mixed 1 cup of cheese in with the green beans and mixed the other cup with some french fried onions in the can for the topping (I did not use the cracker crumbs at all). I also sauted the onions ahead of time in the butter and added a handful of french fried onions in the bean mixture too. Delicous!!

Better than regular old green been casserole with the mushroom soup. The only change i made in this recipe, was use french fried onions instead of crackers, i dont think that green bean casserole would be as good without them. Delicious!

I cooked this for thanksgiving this year and my whole family LOVED it! I didn't change much .. on purpose. I actually messed up and bought a french onion flavored sour cream and didn't know it! I risked it and it turned out wonderful, it just added more flavor! I also used french fried onions instead of the cracker/butter combo. I will definately make this again and again!!

I used the normal roasted onions as the topping and omitted the onions from the recipe. Richer than the casserole with cream soup, but tasted just like it.

My family really liked this dish when i served it yesterday for Thanksgiving. I used more like a 1/2 cup of onion and used way more than 1/2 cup of crackers (i used enough to cover the top completely). The crackers used were Club Crakers Original by Keebler.

Excellent recipe...I followed the recommendations and sauteed the onions in the butter, mixed the cheese in with the green beans and cut back on the sour cream.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit. People that had never had green bean casserole all loved it and we had no left overs. I made some changes though! I used fresh green beans and didn't use onions inside or flour or crackers. But I did use french onions on top. OMG it came out so good.

I made this and a more traditional version (Green Bean Casserole 1) for two options at Thanksgiving. Most people who tried this and commented really liked it. Nobody did not like it that I am aware of. One said they still prefer the traditional version. I followed directions except I only put in 1 cup of cheese and stirred it into casserole (per other reviews), and I stirred most of a square box of fresh sliced mushrooms into the casserole. I also used a whole package of Ritz crackers and 4 tablespoons butter. I thought it was a nice spin on the traditional version, but similar enough that it still satisfies the craving.

Did you know the standard Green Bean Casserole made with cream of mushroom soup has MSG in it? So if you're like me and MSG gives you migraines then this is the recipe for you. I actually like it better too!

My wife wondered why I couldn't just follow a "regular" green bean casserole recipe... and then she tasted my production of "Grandma's Green Bean Casserole"... and she TOTALLY HOOKED.  We both are.  This is an amazing recipe.

Being a lousy cook, I still managed to make this dish easily, and I got rave reviews from family and friends who all tried it. Way better than traditional green bean casserole!!

My guests raved about this dish.  Apparently this will be my contribution to potluck dinners from now on.  I didn't use any onion, but I followed the recipe after that and it turned out beautifully.

I am not a big green bean casserole fan, but was asked to bring one for a potluck holiday supper.  So, I looked around and found this one.  I am not a big fan of the cream of soup casseroles or the onion toppings.  So, this one caught my eye.  My father does not think it is a holiday dinner without green bean casserole.  He has asked for this one every year.  And, I will actually eat it too!

4.5 Stars. I'd always turned my nose to the idea of green bean casserole but this recipe changed my mind! It's easy to prepare and I really like the sour cream in this recipe. I toss the onion in the food processor to get more of an onion purée and I find that improves the texture of this dish.

A nice change from the traditional green bean casserole. Used liquid Butter Buds instead of butter. Added a small amound of Durkee Fried Onions(didn't have much, will use more in the future) and cheese to mixture. Topped with crackers and more cheese. Will keep in the rotation

Doesn't taste like the "classic" casserole made with cream of mushroom soup; and with all that butter, it's not really any healthier either. Even evaluating it on its own merits (shocking, I know), it's not quite my cup of tea - I don't think the flavors of the green beans and the sour cream go together. My wife and unborn child seemed to like it, though, which is why I am giving it 3 stars instead of less. I mean no offense to the author of this recipe, I just want to warn people that if they're looking for a from-scratch version of green bean casserole, this might not be it.

This was good, but my version is a bit better.  I do the traditional way but add cheese mixed in with the green beans.  I put very little bread crumbs on top and a few slices of butter.

I made this dish for the first time for Easter Sunday and I was so surprised at what a big hit it was, I honestly did not expect it to even be touched, I was lucky to have any leftover.  It was so yummy- The only thing I changed was not added the buttery crackers on top and it wasnt missed.  This is a very tasty recipe and I highly recommend it.  Super easy to make and so full of flavor.

Sooooooo good.  I halved the recipe and nearly ate the whole thing myself!  I didn't have butter crackers, so subbed with jalapeno cornbread crackers.  The slight heat was a great addition.  This ones a keeper.

I made this but used two cans of asparagus and one can of chick peas instead of green beans.  It was a big hit with asparagus lovers in my family.  Even those that don't like asparagus thought it was decent.  I drained everything of course and you have to fold the asparagus in gently since canned asparagus is very tender.

Who does'nt like Green Bean Casserole? The only thing I did with this is added a little extra sour cream. You can never have to much sour cream in a casserole.

Made this for huge family potluck on Christmas day and received compliments from everyone...not your run of the mill green bean casserole. I used old cheddar cheese to add flavour and the dish was great. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for Christmas, because I got tired of broccoli and cheese for every holiday dinner. I was skeptical, because I've never had green bean casserole before. However, this is going to become a staple at our holiday dinners. I followed the changes by reviewer "momma_s." I only sprinkled about 1/2 of a cup of mild cheddar on top; the rest was mixed right in with the beans in the casserole. I was leary about the crackers and considered replacing them with breadcrumbs, but they really do complete the dish.

EXCELLENT!!  I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it.  It's a much better recipe than the soupy ones and was really easy.  Everone raved about the crackers, they added just a bit of crunchy saltiness that the dish needed. Between this and "Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic" from this site, Thanksgiving was declared The Best Ever.  I made it as written, no substitutions or alterations needed.

Never will I make the bland "traditional" recipe again. This was fantastic! I did use French fried oinions instead of the crackers because that is what I had, but I am sure they are equally good with the crackers.

Not good - very bland even though I had added garlic and onion in abundance. Will not make this one again.

Really, really good-- this tastes absolutely delicious, which makes sense because it is LOADED with cheese. The canned green beans were ok but I think I'd opt for fresh ones next time.

Excellent side dish!  I used frozen french cut beans from trader joes.  I mixed some cheese throughout.  I also substituted fried onions instead of crackers (personal preference).  It was a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

We thought this was a great recipe. It was easy to make and much better than the one with mushroom soup. I did make one change because I was out of any buttery crackers so I used Cheese Nips instead, turned out great.

Way better than Campbell's version. Will never use another recipe for GB casserole again. I lightly cooked the onions and prepared the dish minus the topping the night before Thanksgiving. Everyone raved on how much better this one is! Thanks so much!

This was so super yummy. I put my own spin on it by adding garlic powder and carmelized the onions before adding to the mix. It was gone the day after Thanksgiving! Really is so much better then the canned soup version! You must try you will not regret!

This is fantastic! I doubled the recipe, used french fried onions on top instead of the crackers, omitted the onion, and used about 2/3 of the cheese (mixed 1/2 of the cheese into the casserole).

It's missing something for me and I can't figure out what.  I left out some of the sour cream as other suggested and it was still creamy.  I also mixed cheese in and added it on top.  I even added those french fried onions but still not the same as the kind made with soup...

I was a bit concerned how this dish would turn out after reading other members' reviews, but it was absolutely fantastic!  My first time making it was for a Thanksgiving feast with friends- talk about a gamble!  The only things I changed was sauteeing the onions (added 1/4 cup chopped crimini mushrooms) first and mixing the cheese in with the beans prior to coating with the cracker crumbs.  It got rave reviews from the diners- this dish is now in my permanent recipe collection!

This was absolutely out of this world!  The BEST dish on the Thanksgiving table.  Wow!  However, I must admit that I used much of momma_s’ suggestions, which is the “most helpful” review for this recipe – EXCEPT I did not mix cheese or French fried onions in with the green beans NOR did I add extra cheese.  I used fresh steamed green beans (HUGE difference), reduced the sour  cream to about ¾ cup, added black pepper and 1.5 tsp or garlic powder.  I mixed half a can of crushed French fried onions in with the crackers and doubled the butter at this point.  500 stars!  A winner!

-2 lbs of fresh beans (blanch for 3-4 mins)
- 1/2 cup of diced onions (instead of 1/4)
- Fresh garlic (about 1-2 cloves)
- Like others mentioned, reduce to 3/4 cup sour cream,  add black pepper. Add fried onions to butter cracker topping. I use half the amount of cheese.

BEST...THANKSGIVING...SIDE...EVER!!!  I did as others suggested and mixed 1/2 the cheese and some French's Fried Onions in with fresh green beans.  I also put some of the Fried Onions on top.  Can't wait for Christmas.  Won't ever touch the other green bean casserole again!

I always hated green bean casserole, I disliked the cream of mushroom and it always seemed bland to me. I found this recipe and was quite thrilled! Made exactly as shown, not a big fan of onions so I just saute'd them first to make sure they would be well cooked. Came out great and everyone says they prefer it over the 'old skool' version! thank you Grandma!

I thought this was pretty good.  I made it for a friend's Thanksgiving get-together and I will say that someone specifically asked, "Who made the green bean casserole?  That was great!"  The sour cream adds a "tangy" taste.  I used the crackers, but I agree the friend onions would probably taste better.  I also sauteed the onions and didn't add as much cheese which were suggestions by others.  I might make it again...or might just make the traditional recipe.  This one is nice when you are looking for something different.

Hard to beat any of Grandma's casseroles, this one included!! :) Made this last night. The sour cream sauce is great with the cheesy layer on top. I added chopped mushrooms into the skillet with the onion mixture. Took the advice of other reviewers and used french onions on the top instead of crackers, I really think it gave it more flavor. This will replace my usual "can o soup" casserole every holiday.

I was looking for something a little different for green bean casserole for our Canadian ThanksGiving and found this and made it exactly as the recipe called for EXCEPT subst Cheddar with Fontina since I can't eat cheddar and it was simply delicious~~~no leftovers to bring home

Well...I reviewed this back when I made it, but AR didn't save the review. (?) So anyway, we didn't like this. We didn't even finish it, I'm sad to say. The sour cream absolutely overpowered everything, and tasted strongly of sour cream and not much like anything else at all. I like green beans (husband doesn't); he likes sour cream (I don't); neither of us liked this. I was bothered by the sour cream, he was bothered by the fact the sour cream did NOT mask the green beans enough. For contrast: I do like the green bean casserole that comes on the side of the French's onion can (but he doesn't like that either.) So I don't know what to recommend to people--some people WILL like this a lot (and the ratings reflect that). But some people will absolutely refuse to finish their serving, but then I guess that's true of anything! Thanks for the recipe, I really couldn't find anything wrong with it, it just wasn't for us :)

I've made this recipe again and again without any alterations. I tend to change up recipes constantly, but as far as I'm concerned, this one is perfect. The onions have always turned out soft (and I'm extremely sensitive to onions. I'd just as soon leave them out!), the sour cream amount is perfect, and the flavors blended together create a unique, almost tangy green bean casserole. I feel this definitely doesn't need the French onions that some people suggested and the cheese really adds something. I constantly crave this dish. Honestly, if you're going to make this dish, try it first without the alterations. You might be surprised at how incredible it is.

I NEVER give 5 stars but with my modifications this is unbelievable.  So much better than the old Cream of Mushroom Soup Recipe.  3 Tbl. Olive Oil instead of the butter no salt no sugar Sauteed the onions Used Fat Free Sour Cream Only (2) cans of green beans 1 cup of shredded Cheddar 1 cup of sliced Mozzarella 1 cup of Fried onions instead of crackers Mix everything together except the cheeses. Add the sliced mozarella Add the Cheddar Add the Fried Onions FABULOUS!

This was an okay recipe.  It was a nice change from the normal mushroom soup recipe, but I thought that the sour cream was a little over powering.  Everyone at my easter party ate it, and everyone said it was good, but just different, or not what they expected.  It wasn't horrible, but I don't think I would make this again.

I don't know what went wrong but the sour cream curdled in the oven. I had to redo the casserole with the classic recipe and make it with the cream of soup and french fried onions.

Made this for Easter, most liked it including me. The sour cream is the strongest flavor in the dish so maybe I'll try cutting back on it a bit next time. I'm not a fan of the version with mushroom soup so this is a nice alternative, I did top it with the French's fried onions instead of the bread topping suggested here because I think this makes the dish.

I was searching for a recipe that did not contain canned mushroom soup when I stumbled upon this one and I am SO glad that I did! This is a fantastic dish and is now the only green bean casserole dish I will make!  The only modification I make is to reduce salt to 1/2 tsp.  Thanks so much!

There were no leftovers! My family can be extremely picky when it comes to some foods, especially greenbeans. This however; I cooked for Thanksgiving and just slid it between a few other food items and then passed it around. It cooked up nicely, didn't interfer with everything else because I didn't feel like I had to stand over it the whole time and was a big hit with everyone.

What a wonderful made from scratch recipe! It was easy to make and loved that it didn't call for cream of mushroom soup. Don't get me wrong I like using cream of mushroom soup in cooking but I wanted something more in this simple recipe. I found it in Grandma's Green Bean Casserole. My family loved it! This is the recipe I will use from now on! Thanks for sharing!

tasty recipe. I did not add the teaspoon of salt, but dusted it with some seasoning salt to taste. I sauteed the onion in the butter, added the flour and sugar and then mixed those into the bean/sour cream mixture. I only used about 1.5 cups of cheese and did not add the extra table spoon of butter to the crackers as they are already buttered and I don't think it affected the recipe. Overall, this was good but I may add some spices next time through for a little more oomph :)

I made this for our big family Thanksgiving last year, and I am proud to say I didn't have any leftovers! Even my husband, who does not believe in green beans, ate his share and went back for seconds! Certainly going to be my staple for our next family get-together!

Excellent recipe. I was asked to bring a green bean casserole to Thanksgiving and when I showed up with this, my family was shocked I didn't bring the normal fried onion and mushroom soup variety. After tasting it, everyone asked for the recipe. Now everytime we have a family gathering I am asked to bring this dish. Thanks!

We tried this tonight and I must say I was surprised at how much everyone loved it! At first they were a little dissapointed that Mom did not make the old standby greenbean casserole, but the first bite of this changed thier minds! In fact I am having some leftovers right now. The only thing I did different was add a little more butter to the frying pan and a little more sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

As my 2-yr old would say, "Dee dee dee liddish!"  Made for Christmas after reading all the rave reviews.  I should have made a double batch.  Everyone loved it, it was gone fast.  I sauteed the onions in butter alone before adding, as others have suggested.  Also left out all but just a dash of the sugar.  Used 3/4 cup sour cream, which was plenty.  Used full cup second time making this, and I prefer with just 3/4 cup.  Also added the crunchy fried onions to the mix, and about half of the cheese, before baking.  Then added the rest of cheese on top, and some more fried onions on top, broiled on low for 3 minutes at the very end to get it a little crispy.  Oh yes, added about 1/8 tsp pepper too before backing.  Forgot it the second time and it really needed the pepper.  This is nice and creamy, fantastic, much better flavor than the standard creamy soup recipe.  Plus, much less salt involved, which is great for my dh with high blood pressure.  I rarely made this traditionally because of the high salt content of the cream soups, but now dh wants me to make this all the time.  A huge winner!

I have made this recipe twice now.  It is excellent and a great change from the "traditional" green bean casserole.  I do like fried onions, so I add just a smidge to the topping.  But that is just my personal taste.

Followed the recipe as printed, except I did saute the onions in the butter.  In the end, I did find it indeed a bit too sour creamy with a little too much cheese. It wasn't bad, but next time I make it, I'll take the advice of another reviewer and ease up on the cream and add a little less cheese.

This is the best Green Bean Casserole I've ever eaten.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because my husband didn't care for it (but he doesn't like anything that has the word "casserole" in it, so you can't judge this recipe by his opinion!)

These are great! I like it with about half the cheese and a little more crackers. We also prefer fresh green beans to canned. I cut and boil them for about 4 minutes before baking.

Wonderful recipe!  I made it for my family Christmas dinner, and everyone raved about it.  I went back for seconds, and it was gone!  Guess I'll have to make a double batch next time!

This was an awesome change to the ol' green bean casserole.. Next time I will sautee the onions in the butter first, as they were a little crunchy.  Overall, I was very pleased.

This is a nice alternative to the "canned soup" beans.  I found it perfect as is.  The topping was sought after, so make sure that you have enough!

This was VERY creamy! I think next time I will do like the other reviewers and cut down on the sour cream. Otherwise it was yummy and everyone thought it tasted great! I added french fried onions in the witht the green beans and the put the cracker mixture on top. I also think I would cut out the sugar all together from this because you could taste the sweetness. Thank You!

I thought this was great as is, but my husband thought that there were too many onions.  So, I made it with half of the onions my second go around and we both thought it was delicious!  Now this is holiday dinner staple.  Thanks

AWESOME!  Seriously, I don't even like green beans and this is phenomenal.  Even passed the mother-in-law test with flying colors.  Easy to make ahead, just put in the fridge all made up, and just add 8-10 minutes bake time.  The only thing I changed was cooking the onions a little longer in the pan before adding the sour cream to ensure texture.  Thanks a ton!

Was a great alternative to the "traditional" green bean dish with cream of mushroom soup. This will now be our new green bean dish served at holiday gatherings.

Followed ingredients exactly, except sauteed the onion in the butter until soft.  Also, added some fresh ground pepper, but overdid it a bit on that (just a sprinkle would have been better).  I loved the flavors and texture, but found it a little too rich.  Next time, will cut down on the sour cream to 3/4 cup, and will try low fat sour cream.  I'll also add a few more crackers to the top.  My husband missed the french fried onion topping from the traditional recipe.  I didn't... I loved the crackers.  I think the cheese is just perfect: I used good quality shredded sharp cheddar. I agree with others that fresh green beans would be wonderful in this recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! Instead of using canned green beans, I followed another user's suggestion and steamed fresh ones. One hint: After stirring together butter and flour, use a wire wisk and slowly add and mix sour cream. Then add sugar, salt and onion.

Velveeta!
I read a few reviews that spoke of the oils of the cheddar making the recipe greasy, so I used velveeta in it's place. As for other things I did, I heeded previous reviewers and used frozen whole green beans (thawed a bit with warm water), added fried onions (my favorite: 1/2 in the mix and the other 1/2 on top), and added fresh crumbled bacon in the mix and on the top.
Loved this recipe, and so did everyone else. With a mixed family Thanksgiving, I heard the most raving about this green bean casserole than anything else.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  I'm not used to eating canned beans.  There was too much sour cream in this recipe.  It felt like I was just eating sour cream.  I won't make this again.

I HATE the regular mushroom soup green bean casserole that everyone seems to bring. Since I was in charge I was set on making something different. I am so GLAD i found this recipe. I followed the directions except I cooked the onions until soft and mixed one cup of cheese in with the beans. This was so good in fact I am craving this as I write this. yummy!!

11-27-09 Editing last year's review to say I used frozen broccoli florets this year instead of green beans and WOW!  I think it's better!  I doubled the recipe but didn't want it to be too sour creamy so I used 1 cup sour cream and half a block of cream cheese!  I also stirred in some half and half so it wouldn't be a thick gluey mess.  There isn't a single bit left.  The casserole dish was practically licked clean!  The flavor is incredible!


Last years review: This was delicious! The only subsitution I made was I used frozen green beans instead of canned.  I also doubled the recipe.

This is the first green bean casserole I've made and I altered the recipe a bit based on other reviews. I used frozen green beans and boiled them for a few minutes, then I cut them in half because they were long. I used french-fried onions instead of fresh onions. I also crumbled half of the french fried onions and mixed them with the crackers as noted in another review. I served it for Thanksgiving and it turned out great. My guests didn't believe it was my first time making a green bean casserole and everyone loved it!

This green bean casserole was a huge hit this Thanksgiving. I will never go back to the cream of mushroom & french onion one again. I did use a 1/4 cup less on the sour cream and added extra garlic & herb spices because of previous comments. It was perfect!

This recipe was easy to make; however, it contained way too much sour cream.  I also think I prefer this recipe with the fried onions on top.  I think I will make someting else next time.

This is great.  I steamed 2 lbs of fresh green beans the day before. omitted the onion, decreased the sour cream to about 1/2-2/3 cup, cut salt in half, added pepper and about 1 tsp garlic powder.  mixed 1/2 can french fried onion rings into beans, mixed other half with crushed ritz crackers and butter for the top.  I used less than the two cups of cheese and mixed some into the beans. Everyone loved this and asked me to make it for Christmas.

This recipe was good, although mine did not cook all the way through because i thought i could get ahead of the game and refriigerate it and make it early, and since it was cold it was still cold when i pulled it out! Dumb me! I did make a few changes, i sauted the onion with the butter before adding the flour, and i mixed the cheese in with the greenbeans as opposed to putting a layer on top. It was delicous and we will be making it next year! And this time i wont put it in the refrigerator!! :)

like I even need to review this if 700 something people have made it already you know it's good...I added bacon just because we have a house full of bacon lovers but I've made it without bacon before and it's still just great! This is a keeper.

I actually hate green beans. I'm 30 and this is the FIRST dish I have ever liked green beans, it's that good! 
Here are a few changes I made...Used fresh snap green beans that I steamed/boiled for 10 min in Chicken broth. I did saute the onions in the butter first before adding the flour,sugar and salt to it. I mixed 1 and a 1/2 cups of cheese in with the mixture and not on top. I mixed half a cup of french fried onions in with the mixture and crushed the rest with the butter crackers on top with the melted butter. YUM! Was a hit!!!

I made this Green Bean casserole last year for my very large family for Thanksgiving. I had to make two dishes and I was hoping to take some left overs home with me, but it was ALL gone! My family now loves this one and I will be making again every year!
Thank you for this Green Bean Casserole!

Great easy & tasty recipe.  I cooked the onions for a bit before I added the beans.  A great alternative to the Cream of Mushroom soup version.

This has become my family's favourite side dish for special meals. My husband and I both crave it. It's easy to make and so good. I use crushed Ritz Cheddar crackers for the crust and a mix of Mozza and Cheddar cheese. Even without onions, it still tastes good.

Perfect! I have a wheat allergy so I amended this recipe a little, substituting the flour with "gluten free flour" and substituting the crackers with gluten free rice snaps.  Yum!!

The recipe was OK, but not good or great. I made it exactly as described, and thought the sour cream flavor was too strong. Perhaps if the amount of sour cream was reduced, it would be more in balance. I really, really love cheese, but there was also too strong a cheddar cheese flavor for this dish. The basic problem is that there is not enough green bean flavor, and too much sour cream and cheese flavor. I want a green bean casserole to have green beans as the prominent flavor.

Loved it!!  So did my boyfriend, and he usually doesn't like anything that wasn't made by his mom.  The only thing i did differently was mix the cheese in with the green beans, and cut the sugar and salt by half.

I love this recipe. I made it over the holidays, and my family came back for thirds. It was my first time making a holiday meal, and it was a total hit. I made it exactly the way it is written. Now that I'm confident in the recipe I now make it with the following changes: 
I used low fat sour cream, reduced fat cheddar cheese, and the low sodium/red fat ritz crackers.

I really didn't care for this.  I think the sugar was why I didn't really like it too much. I was looking for a more salty dish and it was just too sweet for me.  My fiance thought it was good so I might make it again without the sugar.

This was a nice change from the normal mushroom soup kind.  I did change it up a little.  I thought it needed some more flavor so I added some garlic.  Instead of crackers over the top, I put cheese french fried onions.  Green bean casserole is just not complete without the french fried onions!  Overall it was a nice change and something I would make again.

We loved this version of green bean casserole!  It is very unique and has a great flavor. The only changes I made were to saute the onions in the butter first and to mix cheese throughout the mix because I don't like crispy onions and I love cheese.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

For some reason, for me this recipe was VERY dry.  I prepared it EXACTLY as directed, checked on it about 1/2 way through the cooking time, and it was DRY, DRY, DRY.  I added cheddar broccoli soup (it's what I had on hand) to try to "save" it and after that addition it was great. Everyone loved it, but if I hadn't had the soup it would have too dry.  I thought maybe it was my oven, but everything else turned out right.

10 stars!!! I made with Christmas dinner, and everyone loved them!! What a nice change! I will admit,, I mixed a few french fried onions in,, just a little,, and mixed a few in the cracker topping too. And I can't have green beans without adding a small can of mushrooms in too.   I will never make the old green beans again!!!

This was way too rich for my taste. If you are a fan of the original green bean casserole (cream of mushroom soup and green beans) then you will probably not enjoy this casserole. I made it for 10 people and only 2 ate more than a couple of bites.

This is a very good recipe.  My wife loved it too.  On the plus side, it's very yummy!  On the down side, it's high in calories with the butter, cheese and sour cream.  I plan to make this again in the future.

Awesome, a nice twist on the traditional casserole, especially if you like a little more than the "cream" soups like we do!!!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now for holiday dinners.  I usually saute the onions in bacon drippings to which I add the flour called for in the recipe.  I add the cheese to the sauce mix and top with french fried onions.  I will never make the old soup based Green Bean Casserole again!

This is a wonderful - and easy - recipe. I needed a recipe from scratch, as one of my guests was allergic to pepper. Followed another users advices - added 1/2 can of french fried onions into the bean mix, then crunched the rest with the crackers for the topping. Made it the night before, and it just had to be thrown in the oven - no leftovers!

I don't think this is a recipe I'll be using this very much. I did use a tablespoon of cornstarch rather than the 2 tablespoons of flour because of a gluten allergy of one of my guests for Christmas dinner, and used a sliced almond topping instead of crackers. I will hang on to this recipe because of the above mentioned guest who is in my home a lot. But I really missed the mushroom soup flavor. Next time I think I'll add a can of mushrooms with the juice to get it. I also missed my french fried onions, but that couldn't be helped because of the allergy.

My husband doesn't like traditional green bean casserole so he was weary to try it. Turned out to be a hit at our house on Christmas! I will use fresh green beans next time.

4* on this one since recipe required modification to be a 5*.  Made recipe as written first time and modified it since. With all the cheese, any extra salt is too much.  1/2 the cheese + double the crackers - (no butter with the crackers for the top).

To make this, I saute the onions in the butter in a deep pot then stir in the flour.  I mix in the sour cream and sugar then the grated cheese and pre-cooked fresh (or frozen) green beans.  Spread in the baking dish and sprinkle crumbled crackers over the top.  Always, always, always get asked for this recipe.

ETA - over a decade  later, still a hit, now my daughter is out on her own and is making a name for herself bringing this dish to potlucks!

This is a wonderful recipe for this dish...I read the reviews and suggestions of others and added garlic and bacon bits.  Although good, next time, I will omit the bacon.

Delicious, it's a much better alternative to the standard cream of mushroom green bean casserole. I was a bit skeptical but after reading the reviews I decided to give this a chance. I made this as a side for christmas dinner and it was DELICIOUS, YuM-O! You have to try this!

Delicious!  I tried this recipe 2 or 3 Holidays ago as my dish to pass was green bean casserole. I was tired of the same old recipe we had been eating for  20 years! I found this new version of the recipe and now I have to bring this to every Holiday dinner...everyone just loves it!  
One review that I read suggested making it the night before and I did that after the first time I made it and it is even better when it has time to sit in the refrigerator.
This is a very simple and easy recipe to make and is very, very good.

Very good. I'm going to try it again without the low fat sour cream. I think it needs the richer, creaminess of regular. It doesn't replace the feel-good of the traditional, but it is an excellent recipe for that something "different".

I have always loved the typical soup and fried onion green bean casserole, but no more!  This recipe is a keeper.  I shared it with a friend for Thanksgiving, and she got rave reviews as well.  Thank you for sharing!!

I guess for a grean bean casserole it was the best I've ever tasted.  But I'm not a lover of this kind of dish.  My husband loved but kids and I didn't.

I followed the recipe to the letter ... I always find it's disastrous to deviate when making a recipe for the first time.  My family does not eat cream of mushroom soup as it typically has MSG in it ... and I was looking for an alternate vegetable.  Thank you allrecipes.com for featuring this casserole.  It was by far superior to any green bean casserole I've ever had.  I did use fresh green beans rather than canned and there wasn't a single serving left after Thanksgiving dinner was over.  I did not find the cheese to be excessive and I loved the texture of the onions.  I will never make another green bean casserole again.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving and it was delicious. (even better the next day!)  I sauteed the onion in the butter until translucent and added half the cheese to the green beens.  I added all of the sour cream but agree next time I make it I may add less as the sour cream was a bit too strong.  I also added french fried onions on top but I think I will stick with Ritz crackers next time.  Over all it was delicious!

This was EXCELLENT. The french style beans made it much richer and tastier then the traditional soup recipe. The ritz crackers are always a great choice for a tasty and crunchy topping. The real onions instead of the dried canned kind were terrific. DON'T CHANGE A THING!

I LOVED these.  The cheese made it extra rich and delicious.  I substituted the traditional fried onions for the ritz mixture & it turned out great!  I'm sure this will become and heirloom holiday recipe in our house.

Wow, was this good!  SO much better than the version with canned cream of mushroom soup!  The only changes I made were that I sauteed the onions first, and also added sauteed fresh mushrooms (for this reason, I made more of the "sauce").  I also used extra sharp white cheddar, and topped with canned french fried onion rings instead of cracker crumbs.  My husband and I each had seconds it was so good!  Thanks for a truly outstanding recipe!

We really liked this for Thanksgiving. I also put some of the cheese into the bean mixture. Used french fried onions on top because the cracker mixture is so rich. Tasted great. Definately don't skip the onions in this, it makes a big difference.

Everyone, including me, LOVED this recipe!!  I made it for thanksgiving and it was the first dish to go.  Everyone had seconds and thirds.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was the perfect combination of everything.  I have been asked to bring this again for our Christmas dinner.  I hate the Cream of Mushroom/chicken taste in other recipes...so this was the perfect recipe for me.  I added enough cheese to cover the top...I didn't measure I just shredded right on the casserole. Oh..and I didn't add the crunchy top...I left it out because I forgot..lol
I made this the night before, stored it in the fridge and then baked for 30 mins the next day. YUMMY!!!

I had never had green bean casserole before but I made this one for Thanksgiving and everyone went on and on about how good it was, I even thought it was really good. I added the french fried onions inside and on the top, omitted the sugar, and used about half the amount of cheese. Turned out great and I will defiantly be making these for more family gatherings!! Thanks!!

This dish is decent.  The dish came out somewhat too sour for my taste.  Even my husband who loves sour cream said he didn't like it.  Next time, I will just use the usual cream of mushroom soup for the dish.

I would rate this recipe as fair.  It certainly was not the best side dish at Thanksgiving.

My family loved this recipe!  It was gone within minutes of being put on the table.  I loved how creamy it was, the contrast of the sauce with the beans.  I don't like cheese very much, so I halved the cheese topping and it turned out fantastic.

I made this recipe in a 13x9 pyrex dish for Thanksgiving this year and everybody loved it!  The sour cream-based filling is a nice alternative to condensed cream of mushroom soup - plus it has a lot less sodium.

I made this yesterday for thanksgiving dinner, my dinner partner and I both did not care for this at all. FRESH beans would make a huge difference, and it needs to be more creamy. I found the bean flavor to be completely overpowering.
I will definitely continue looking for a different recipe.

I wasn't impressed. It wasn't as good as the traditional green bean casseroles. More ingrediants does not always mean better. Sour cream, no thanks. I also found the green beans to be too hard. I wish I had at least added french's friend onions like some people did. What a waste when it was the only thing I made on Thanksgiving. I won't be making this again.

I was requested to bring Green Bean Casserole to our friend's house for Thanksgiving. I prefer not to cook something that I actually don't like so I found this recipe to make instead. The only change I made was to leave out the salt (canned green beans are salty enough) and the sugar. I also sauteed the onions to soften them up. It turned out fantastic and was a big hit.

They're right, this rocks!  It is easy and tasty.  I used French's Fried Onions to top it, since that is what people expect with a green been casserole.  I WILL be making this one again. Updated:  It is a regular request by my family who thought they'd never like anything other than the recipe on the mushroom soup can!  Thank you for a tasty, tasty alternative.  I don't know if it is any healthier, but I like to think it is. ;-)

I reduced cheddar cheese to 3/4 cup, used 3/4 cup sour cream and no milk, plus added 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, increased onion to about 1 cup chopped, and sprinkled the top with cheesy french fried onions in the can. (oh, I also cut back on the butter it called for)

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving thinking it would a new twist to an old favourite. I was not very good compared to the original green bean casserole. I do not recommend this recipe to anyone. The sour cream still tasted like sour cream, smothered with green beans.

So good. I used white cheddar cheese and mixed in some mushrooms. Even my father in law - not a green bean fan by any means - had a bite and gave it high marks.

Have made this recipe for a while now. Mix half the cheese in with green bean mixture. I also sauté the onions and a few cloves a garlic in olive oil. I use Ritz crackers. Every time my family has a potluck I am asked to make this. I'm not going to my family's thanksgiving this year, and was asked by my aunt if I could make this and drop it off on my way to the NFL game we're going to.

changed to 7 servings to test. Used about 1/2 cup chopped onion, sauted in oil first.
1/4 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp pepper.  about 1/2 - 3/4 cups cheese (enough to cover top)
GREAT!!

Awesome recipe.  I doubled it and had great results.  I, like others, used freshly steamed beans, less cheese and sour cream than the recipe calls for, and  grated the onions.  Tasted a lot like traditional green bean casserole but was even better because it was less artificial.

Incredible- I loved it more than the traditional version. I even found hydrogenated-oil-free buttery round crackers at Trader Joe's, so I'm excited!  Others at the table all liked it, but some said they would still prefer the traditional dish. I don't care- it gets 5 stars and I can't wait to eat it again!

I personally would have given this less stars, but their were some at Easter dinner who enjoyed, so...  I just missed the cruncy fried onions and enjoyed the original better, though if I were to make this again I'd make sure to use a better name brand cheddar cheese, I used a cheap brand and it seemed as though the cheese made a coagulated film over the top, and I also would have used more then the recommended crackers on top, and a bit less sour cream, but honestly, I'm going back to the mushroom soup casserole recipe.

YES!!! Finally a way to get my husband to eat one of my favorites... the only change I made was to use the cut green beans, instead of the french cut, so that my little one could pick them up easier.  DELISH!!!

This recipe is so good, don't skip on putting in onions. It definitely needs it to balance out the sour cream.  My sister in law made this one and everyone wanted the recipe! I made it w/o onions, didn't have any on hand, and definitely needed it.

Green bean casserole is a tradition in our house for every holiday. After eating the standard for years, I will never go back. This recipe is so good that everybody is in awe trying to figure out what is different. The recipe is a must to bring along because people will definitely ask for it. I have made it twice. The first time exactly how it is directed and it was great. The second time off memory, so I goofed and forgot the sugar and stirred in the cheese, which I actually liked even better. I think it gives it a richer, creamier texture. You just can't go wrong. The ritz and sour cream completely do away with that processed flavor you get from the mushroom soup/french onion recipe.

Definitely a hit!  I made this for Xmas dinner along with Filet Mignon and twice baked potatoe and it dissappeared within minutes!  I made it the night before and just added the cheese and crackers to the top before putting in the oven.  I did what another reviewer suggested and mixed in some of the cheese with the green bean mixture.  Good bye to the Campbell's Green Bean Casserole and hello to Gradma's Green Bean Casserole!

Forget the french fried onions...this is the best green bean casserole I've ever tasted!  It was a big hit and my husband really enjoyed it since it didn't have cream of mushroom soup.  This will be your new "staple" recipe for the holidays!

was a little bland for my liking.  My guests seemed to like it.  It needs a little something else to kick up the flavor.  I doubled the recipe, used frozen french cut green beans and half of the sour cream.

Yum.  I'm not a big green bean fan, nor is my husband, but we were having guests for thanksgiving and thought green bean casserole was a must have.  The sour cream and onion mixture on the beans was almost good enough just like that, but with the cheese and crackers, it was even better.  I'll certainly make this again.

This recipe really bombed on all of my family for our thanksgiving dinner.  Not one person liked it and we followed the recipe to the tee.  It didn't taste anything similar to the traditional dish.  It lacked the mushrooms and flavor.

This was an interesting dish at my thanksgiving table. I used this recipe as a good solid base, although I used green beans that were blanched from the garden, and then frozen this past summer. I don't care for green beans actually but thought this dish was great.  I might add bacon next time, (1 strip cooked and crumbled) sauted the onion in butter, added flour,  beans, sour cream, and mild cheddar. I didn't get the compliments I thought I would get, which surprised me since I thought it was tasted warm and bubbly. Guess Thansgiving just has to much food. Would try again, as a side so the recipe shines more.

This was one of my three side dishes for Thanksgiving (all of which came from this site). I thought there was a bit too much sour cream for my taste, but everyone else seemed to love it. I even had to cook it in the microwave because the oven was  already in use and it still turned out good. Also I did use French's fried onions on top instead of the crackers. Really great, thanks!

This was awesome.  I used fried onions in place of the cracker topping.  I made a double batch and people were licking the pan.  This one is a keeper.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It is such a fresh twist to the old tired cream of mushroom version.  I love green beans, but hate the classic casserole version.  I have made this several times for my family and at holiday parties and everyone loves this dish.  I get so many requests for this recipe.  The only thing I do different is I do not use onion, as I feel it overpowers the dish, and I mix in a little cheese into the beans.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit.  I used steamed, fresh green beans instead of canned and I sauted the onions first before adding the other ingredients.  I thought the sour cream was just a bit over-powering but still quite good.  I will make it again next year!

This was very good. I made it last year and everyone loved it.  This year I used 2 tbs. bacon grease instead of butter and mixed the crumbled bacon along with extra cheddar cheese in with the beans. I used club crackers for topping.  Everyone loved it both ways.  I'll continue to add the bacon and extra cheese if I have them on hand.  If I were making this for myself only, I would use less sour cream.

Love, love, love this recipe and I don't really care for green beans. This is so much better than the usual casserole with the mushroom soup. Made this for Thanksgiving and the whole dish was gone between just the 4 of us. Yum!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving the last two years, and everyone loves it. By reading the other reviews I did make a few changes. I used low fat sour cream, and only used 1/2 a cup, and mixed it with half a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also used the frozen french grean beans and the fried onions. It is so easy to make, and with the change of ingredients it is great.

This was great!  Only thing I changed was the sour cream, used half a cup instead of the full one cup.  Also I added 2 strips of cooked bacon pieces.  I definetly will be making this again for my thanksgiving guests!

I've used this recipe the past two years.  My mother-in-law called me and asked me to make it again this year because it was well liked.  That is saying a lot since I am no wonder cook!  It also says a lot that quite a few of the people eating this do not care for sour cream at all.  I didn't bother to tell them what was in it until after they ate it.

My mother made the traditional cream of mushroom soup version ONCE, a very long time ago. Of the 10 people in my family, not one of us ate it and liked it, not even my parents... it was terrible! My husband discovered this recipe and convinced me to give it a try. We brought it to a family get-together and left with an empty pan! :) Everyone loved it, even the in-laws, some of whom like the COM soup version. Definitely a keeper and a new tradition.

We didn't care for this at all. I agree with the other reviewers who gave it a low grade - the sour cream is too tangy, it really isn't very creamy, and, we didn't like the rawness of the onion. The one thing we did like though was the cheesy crumbly topping. I would use that bit again. Quite frankly, this recipe is NOT better than the standard mushroom soup and French fried onion version. We'll stick with the tried-and-tested. Thanks anyway.

This never goes to waste at our house.  I've substituted 'regular' greenbeans with great success, and add a clove of garlic while sauting the onions.  YUM!

People in my family who don't like green bean casserole made the "traditional" way LOVED this. My two-year-old son devoured the leftovers for lunch the day after Thanksgiving and kept asking for "more!"  Everyone at my holiday table asked for the recipe and said this is the version they'll be serving at their own gatherings from  now on. It's simply delicious.  I made it "as-written" and would not change a thing. Try and enjoy!

The base of the recipe is good, however I added more onion and also added some garlic powder to taste as prior reviews had stated it was bland. I used Light Sour Cream instead of regular(That was all I had) and you would never know it was light. For the topping I crushed Frenchs Cheddar Onions with Crackers and mixed with butter and it tasted awesome. I did a test run today and will be making again for Thanksgiving tommorrow. YUMMY!!

The best green bean casserole I have ever had!  Once you try this you will never go back to the plain condensed soup green bean casserole.  I always have lots of request for the recipe.

Wow!! I used half squash and half beans (fresh, nuked for 2 minutes each) , also half sour cream (light) and half a can of cream of mushroom soup, and reduced the cheese to like half a cup (half cheddar and half parm). Excellent!! I'm sure it's delicious as written originally. Will definitely be making this again, and again and again!!

This tasted very odd to me. 
I love love the traditional cream of mushroom version, but didn't care much for this at all. Very odd flavor.  I do think I put too much sour cream in it- really seemed to dominant the whole dish. 
Will not make again.

I gave this only three stars, because while it tasted pretty good, it wasn't worth the fat calories that the sour cream and cheese gave it. If I'm going to make a casserole, rather than just steaming fresh veggies, the taste better be worth the extra trouble and calories. This just wasn't in my opinion, even using just half of the original cheese called for and reduced fat sour cream. Also, unless you like very strong onion flavor, cook yours a bit longer than this recipe calls for.

This was a nice change from the tried and true green bean casserole.  They are pretty similar though.  I found it pretty evenly split. Half of my guests like this better the other half prefer the standard. I liked it better so I will be making it again.

YUM!  I really liked this recipe.  It is different and my kids liked it too.  I have made it a couple of times. I didn't have onions, so I just used minced onions.  I also didn't have the buttery crackers, so I just used the regular ones.

I made this for Christmas and got a ton of compliments on it, although I didn't care for it that much.  I made this in a bread pan because that's all that wasn't being used and it fit fine.  Don't think you need a 2 1/2 quart dish.

I dont know if I did something wrong, not sure how that could be though as its fairly simple, but this recipe was not tasty at all. I used fresh beans & added french fried onions.
Will not make again.

This was good. I used fresh beans instead of frozen or canned and the French's onions on top. Next time I will try the cream of mushroom kind. I think the sour cream made it a bit more "tangy" than I wanted.

In place of the 1/4 cup onion, I used the Durkee fried onions, and reduced the sour cream by 1/4 cup. I also placed the leftover onions on top of the casserole along with the crackers. Everyone thought it was great for Thanksgiving.

Much better (in my humble opinion) than your usual version.  I did crumble twice the amount of cracker topping on mine (I 'ike some crunch in my eating).  This is a great alternative to the every-year bland old version that uses canned onions.  Yum!

All I have to say is WOW.  I made this for my famliy Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I was a little leary about shifting from the traditional recipe, but this was SO much better.  I didn't use any chopped onion because I'm not a big fan, but I did add about a 1/4 cup of the french fried version into the mix for a more subtle onion flavor.  It is definately a keeper!!!  Thanks Amy!

Very good recipe.  It was nice to have a different kind of green bean casserole for Thanksgiving.  I think that I added too much cheese.  Next time, I won't use as much.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this at the last minute for a Thanksgiving Recipe Exchange - had all the ingredients, threw it together in 10 minutes and everyone loved it! Now I'm thankful I couldn't find the recipe I originally intended to make : ) Only changes I made are that I used regular green beans and dried chopped onion, due to what I had in my pantry.

Delicious. I made this for a potluck at work and won over a former green bean casserole hater (she'd had only the mushroom soup version). I'm making this again at Thanksgiving.

I took a few bites of this to decide if we liked it or not.  Fiance did, I could take it or leave it.  I prefer the recipe for French's Green Bean Casserole.  I didn't have the crackers on hand, so I used the French's Fried Onions on top instead, but I really don't think that the crackers would've changed my opinion all that much.  thanks for sharing the recipe, and I might make it again.

This was a really tasty and easy recipe.  I used a bag of frozen green beans in place of the canned beans, and used Garlic Butter Ritz crackers for the cracker crumbs and I loved the taste!  It was a hit at my house! A nice change from plain green beans. Thanks!

This was a great change from the old green bean caserole.  I addded 1 pound of cooked bacon crumbled and then topped with Durkee Fried Onions omitting the cracker topping.  This was fantastic!

I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner because I was asked to bring a "green vegetable".  Well someone else brought the regular old version g.b. casserole and mine was waayyy better.  There wasn't a lot of comment on it, as it would be rude to the other person, however, there was none left in my dish, and the plain old version had leftovers available!

This was sooooooooo yummy!  My boyfriend absolutely loved this.  It's a nice change from your traditional green bean casserole.  Next time, I will add mushrooms, and probably saute the onions with some garlic too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the first time I've had green bean casserole, and I'm sorry to say it wasn't really to our taste, although I can see why it would be appealing.  I don't think it was the recipe itself, I think it's just that we prefer fresh green beans served au natural as opposed to canned ones in a creamy sauce.  Oh well...you don't know unless you try it!  :-)

This was a nice variation to the everyday Green Bean Casserole with mushroom soup.  Everyone really liked it.  I did use the french fried onions instead of the cracker crumbs.

Wonderful! I, too, mixed half of the cheese in with the beans. This was far superior to the traditional green bean bake. I'll never go back....

This is a great tasting casserole!  I used cut green beans from the can because I didn't have any french style and it came out great.  I also put french onion crisps (the ones that normally go on green bean casserole) and it tasted wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving with everyone asking for seconds.  I think everyone was surprised that canned green beans could taste so good, because they certainly did with this recipe.

The BEST green bean casserole I have ever had. I am not a fan of cream of mushroom soup, so I was searching for an alternative recipe when I found this. I'll never make it any other way than this! The flavor and consistency are amazing.

I was asked what I would be serving for Christmas. I said, green bean casserole. In response, I was told that 90%  of people polled, rated it their least favorite dish. So I made it. The casserole was empty, and the grandpa that said it, had 2nd helpings!

I used potato chips instead of crackers because my sister - in law is allergic to wheat.  I have also used plain yogurt in place of sour cream.  I use oil as supposed to butter(Using oil instead of butter makes food creamier).  In addition, I use frozen French cut beans rather than from the can.  My family says, however, to let green bean thaw before you make the casserole.  Although the recipe did not call for it, I add one or two cloves of garlic.

Delicious! I cooked the onions as others had recommended. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs on top. The only thing I missed from the canned soup recipe was the French’s Fried Onions so next time I will use them on top instead of bread crumbs and or crushed crackers like the original recipe calls for and lovers of those onions stated on their reviews here. Overall the recipe was so yummy! My family loved it! They just all missed the fried onions on top. Double recipe for more than 6 people. We found there was just enough for the 6 of us. 2 teenagers and 4 adults. Thanks for this recipe!

Made this for early Christmas family gathering and i only got a taste.  It was delicious, easy to prepare and definitely will make again.  Only thing I  changed was topping - I sprinkled bacon bits instead of the cracker crumbs.  It's a keeper.

This recipe as written is incredibly bland!  It seems like it would be a great starting place, maybe even combining it with the traditional recipe.  I definitely won’t be making this again as written. I am absolutely shocked by all the positive feedback this recipe has gotten.

Everyone raved at Thanksgiving. I had people calling and asking for the recipe. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions. I used Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar. I purchased a 16 OZ block. I purchases frozen steamable green beans, 2 lbs worth. I steamed a minute less than the instructions to get them mostly done, but not all the way. I  sautéed the onions in the butter until translucent prior to adding the flour, salt, sugar and sour cream and adding the green beans. 1 added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the green bean mixture. I added the most of the remaining cheese to the top (I don't think I used all of it. I eyeballed it.) Lastly, on top of the cheese, I used a combination of both crumbled Ritz crackers mixed with butter and French's French Fried Onions. Baked according to directions. HUGE HIT!!!! New Thanksgiving staple. Thank you for the great recipe.

Used fresh beans and steamed first. Added a bit of chicken broth to rue and put French fried onions and cheese  in mixture as well as on top but other than that made as is. Everyone raves about them!! I will be making again for sure!

Delicious. Everyone loved it. I would go lighter on the cheese on top next time, and I used the fried onions instead of crackers, but it was a hit at Thanksgiving.

I made a few changes.  2 cans of whole green beans works well if you prefer a little more green bean texture.  I also sauté the chopped onions in butter until softened before adding the flour and finishing sauce.   1/2 the amount of cheese Is plenty for us, and we still like fried onions instead of crackers on top.

I am not a big fan of the traditional green bean casserole because I am not wild about mushroom soup, so was excited to try this recipe.  I loved it and so did the rest of the clan.  I added some French fried onions along with the crackers and butter.  Soooo good!

I made these for Thanksgiving. Everyone liked them. The only complaint was they seemed a little drier than last year. (last year I made the standard green bean casserole with mushroom soup). I'll probably add more sour cream or maybe a touch of milk to make them creamier next time.

Wow! THANKSGIVING HIT! I did change, less sour cream, sauteed in onions first in butter, used 1/4 package onion soup, added mashed tater tots to the bottom!
Shouldve made more!

This was delicious,  did not want to use soup and this is now my go to. Started to make as written but didn't have enough sour cream but had cream cheese. So I used 3/4  of 8oz packaged and left out sour cream. It would also be great with that. Gonna make it again for Christmas with sour cream. Thanks for sharing

I've been making this pretty much since I opened my account here, everyone loves it and requests for Thanksgiving.  The only things I do differently: fresh green beans, extra fresh garlic, and sometimes sharp or extra sharp cheddar.  It's delicious, easy, and I know what's in it.

This is so good! So yummy! The best EVER! I used much more crackers (and the melted butter that goes with it.) I'm sick to death of cream of mushroom soup in dishes. If I have to ever choke down anything with that disgusting gruel again it will be too soon.

Even with reducing sour cream to 3/4 cup it still was overpowering.  Ended up adding a 1/2 can cream of  mushroom soup which greatly improved taste.

So I don’t typically write reviews, but I just had to for this one! Let me start by saying that I don’t like green bean casserole.... this has me forever changed! I hate mushrooms and this was the perfect alternative. The only change I made was to use French onions instead of the crackers and I went back for seconds (and thirds)!!! Thanks for sharing!

I used one pound of fresh green beans trimmed and cut into 1-1/2 inch long pieces. I followed the rest of the instructions as written. It was tasty but very soupy. It needs some bread crumbs mixed in with the green beans and cream of mushroom soup to thicken it up.

This is wonderful! I was looking for a green bean casserole  recipe that didn't have the same old cream of mushroom soup. This recipe fit the bill to perfection. I must say I was skeptical of adding cheddar cheese to green beans, but it sure worked well here. One change I did make was with the topping. I had some Hawaiian kettle style potato chips - both Maui onion and mango habanero. I wanted a bit of a bite to the dish so I crushed the chips with a few of the butter crackers and melted butter. Amazing! I was afraid to use only the mango habanero chips thinking they might add too much of a bite. Next time that is all I'll use. The sour cream in the dish is enough to temper the spice. Even without the topping the dish was great, the chips knocked it out of the park!  Thank you for a great recipe. It is definitely my new green bean casserole go-to!!

I make this for every Holiday and in the summertime for the Lake. We could just eat this forever and be happy! I sauté onions, chopped turkey bacon &  fresh garlic in olive oil, I use Montreal Steak seasoning, and mix the cheese into the casserole before baking.

First time ever making a green bean casserole. The canned green beans were awful and the sour cream/cheddar/ritz crackers was just a weird combination. I used half the salt and it was still too salty (and my crackers were reduced salt!). Never again. Sad because I like most of the recipes on here.

I loved the sauce-we ate on this dish a couple of days and it reheats well. Would make again and I enjoyed it more than that “other” green bean casserole!

Wonderful recipe with only a few changes. First I sautéed the onions and second I used frozen steam fresh green beans.  I was asked to bring this to Christmas dinner and everyone loved them. I even got 2 thumbs up from my twin 5 year old nephews ! It’s a keeper.

Everyone loved this dish, and asked me for the recipe.  I was serving 10 people, so I used 3 pounds fresh green beans, which I steamed.  I sautéed the onions in butter first, as others recommended, then added another 2 tablespoons of butter before the flour and sour cream.  It was a little thick, so added a couple tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, which made the perfect consistency.  I also mixed about 1/2 cup of the cheese into the beans.  Instead of crackers, my family loves the fried onions, so I mixed 1/2 of one can with the beans and topped the dish with a 2nd can.  I used a 10x15 pan, so I had lots of surface area for the remaining cheese and crispy fried onions.  It was excellent.

This was sooooo good. I don’t even like green bean casserole but I keep making and eating this over and over. I mixed some cheese in with the green beans and I cut the flour down to 1 tablespoon. Delicious!!!

Amazing recipe!!! 5 stars even though I altered a bit based on other reviews, which I ??????about Allrecipes; so much amazing input!!! I doubled the recipe (mostly), these are the changes I made - for a 9x13 pan I used 5 cans of french style green beans, 2 c sour cream ( not too much at all!!! Yummy) 1/2 can French’s fried onions mixed in with green beans and 1/2 Swiss and 1/2 cheddar mixed in with green beans, all other ingredients doubled and some of the extra grated cheese on top with crushed crackers and extra French’s onions and melted butter....sooooo good!! Large extended family with 20 +people and 10 side dishes...this was the first to go with rave reviews from all...definitely a new Christmas tradition! Thankyou!!!

I love this recipe! I'm not a huge fan of the traditional cream of mushroom soup version so this is a really great find! I do use a little less sour cream than the recipe calls for but other than that it's perfect. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did!

I followed this recipe to the T and thus this rating is actually for this recipe :D I’d have given it a 5 if the cheese was halved or as a reviewer has suggested mixing half of it in the beans.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I did make modifications per other reviews.  I also increased the ingredients accordingly  as I was feeding more people. The main changes were:
1. Added 1/2-3/4 cup cheese into bean mixture ( I used 2lbs  fresh steam green beans) 
2. Sauteed the (red) onions before adding the flour.
3.  Added 1 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1tsp pepper  with the salt and sugar before adding sour cream.  I increased the flour/ sour cream to make more sauce in the bean mixture but not so much it was soupy with sauce. 
4. Added 1/2 cup of the french fried onions into bean mixture and the rest with the cracker mixtures with extra melted butter. 
5. Added in bacon bits to the bean mixture before topping with the cheese and cracker/french  onion mixture.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was the first time I had made green bean casserole. I did not want to do the whole can thing, and even though this called for canned green beans, it sound homemade. Anyhow, it turned out amazing and it was a huge hit! Definitely going into my favorites for future side dishes! Thank you for sharing!

I made this for Thanksgiving and I did not like it at all. The only thing I changed was that I used thawed frozen green beans, but that was not the issue. The sour cream and sharp cheddar together were too over powering for this dish. I thought it tasted like I mixed beans with a ton of chip dip. My family didn't mind it but nobody went for seconds on that one. Won't use this recipe again unfortunately.

Not for me. I like my green bean casserole to have more creamy sauce in it. Perhaps I messed up in cooking it somehow because other people's pictures appear more saucy than mine.

I was looking for a homemade alternative to the traditional canned-soup green bean casserole recipe. This is it! Loads of flavor. The only change to the recipe I made was to eliminate the crackers and I used gluten free  crispy fried onions and cassava flour instead of wheat flour. Even my very picky daughter loves this recipe.

Followed some advice of others.  Used 2 lbs of fresh green beans in a lg pot of water with chicken broth.  While that was ccooking for about 10 min., I sauteed onions til soft.  Then I added flour, salt and sugar and cooked for 1 min.  Turned off heat and added 3/4 c sour cream and half of cheese and mixed it together.  Then added drained green beans and mixed it all.  Placed in casserole dish and topped with remaining cheese and sprinkled with french's fried onions.  Made it the night before and brought it to Thanksgiving and popped it into the oven.  This will now be our annual Thanksgiving dish, loved it!!!

Wanted to try a new recipe for this dish instead of the standard french fried onion/mushroom soup version and followed directions to the letter. Wife, my harshest food critic, thought it was too sweet. Not sure if it was the sugar or sweetness from the butter crackers or both.

My mom’s green bean dish was always bland and told her I’d make a dish for a holiday meal.  She mocked me for daring to make a recipe with sour cream and still made her own style “to be safe”.  Well this recipe is now asked for by name and is certainly a hit!

By far the best green bean casserole I've ever had! It's an easy favorite. The only thing I do differently is I use french fried onions for the top instead of buttery crackers because I'm lazy.

This was a FAVORITE at Thanksgiving. To save room in the oven, I cooked it in a crockpot on low for about 5 hours. I used another reviewers tip and that worked well. KIMAR said "I sauteed the onion in the butter until tender and translucent, and I reduced the salt and the flour by half, and added half of the cheese into the beans mixture."

I've made this dish several times and, each time, it's been a hit. I incorporated some suggestions, like cutting down the amount of flour from 2 to 1 tablespoon, adding pepper and garlic powder for a little more flavor, and substituting French's fried onions (crushed) for the round crackers and melted butter. I've also followed some directions suggested to saute the diced onions in the butter to soften before adding the spices, then allowing the mixture to cool before adding sour cream and half the cheese. I mix some of the French's fried onions in the mixture before putting in the oven. I also bake uncovered for about the first 15 minutes (until the top is golden and cheese is melted), then cover for the remainder of the time. After the casserole is baked, I add more cheese and French's onions to the top.

Generally good, but I thought the cheese on top overpowered a lot of the other tastes. It was tasty, but I think I actually like the standard version of green bean casserole better. There was something lacking from this one. (Edited to add: I think what's missing is that the French fried onions add a level of crunch to the casserole that this one falls short of. The cheese and crackers make a crust on the top, but it's a different consistency than what I want out of a green bean casserole!)

Very easy and tasty.  I didn't have Ritz crackers so I used French Fried onions.  It tasted great so that is a viable substitution.

I make this every year and I didn’t know it was an actual printed recipe until I came across this one! My only difference is to sweat the onions first, then add some cream cheese to onions melt it down and then add the sour cream spice mixture let it simmer to meld the flavors. After that add fresh green beans along with French to get that home feel casserole texture, toss in a handful of sharp cheddar toss it about throw it on a pan sprinkle with cheddar and some Frenchy’s Onions all over! Delicious!

I fixed the recipe as written but cut back on the salt, and I love salt, and added some garlic powder like one reviewer suggested. Something I do different for thanksgiving, I dice and fry bacon and add it to the mixture. I scoop the bacon out with a slotted spoon and fry the onions in the bacon grease to soften them. If you have bacon drippings left over you can use that in place of the butter to make your roux. I also mixed half the cheese in before transferring to the baking dish and put the rest on top.

Horray for Grandma!  I am not usually a big fan of green bean casserole but this  recipe changed everything.  I used fresh (steamed in the micro for four minutes) and kept with the traditional onion topping but otherwise made as written.   So good!!!

I  made using fresh green beans.  I made the mistake of not cooking them enough, thinking they would continue to soften as they baked in the oven.  I will make again but will either used canned (yuck) or cook them longer.

I wanted something a little different from the usual green bean casserole and found this recipe. I did use canned green beans  (2 cans French cut & 1 can regular cut) and I couldn’t resist adding in the usual French fried onions.  I did add some of the cheese in the bean mixture. It was as good (not quite great) and everyone liked it, although my husband stand wanted to know what was wrong with the ‘old’ GB casserole. Lol

This was a wonderful version of green bean casserole and what will become my go-to recipe for it from now on!  I did not have canned green beans and used Trader Joe's frozen green beans that I steamed beforehand.  I used about 3/4 cup of sour cream as I thought 1 cup may bee too much.  This dish came out perfectly and was super tasty!

Loved this recipe.  I sautéed the onions in the butter before adding the flour,  so they would be soft.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you Amy!

This recipe is the ultimate! I had been looking for an alternative to the nasty traditional green bean casserole, and I found it. I made no changes, they aren't necessary.  This is now a required dish on Easter and Thanksgiving.

I have made this several times, doctoring it a little each time.
I never measure...sorry.   THis one was the best.  I substitute fresh green beans.  Steamed so they are starting to soften.  (You could boil)

I sauted(I used olive oil this time) the onion, one jalapeno, garlic salt, black pepper, sugar, and chipolte seasoning, and a shake of ancho chili seasoning.  Stirred in the flour.  The the sour cream.  I used a mexican cheese blend.  I stirred about a cup into the green beans.  (I made 2 lbs of fresh green beans, so upped all the ingredients a bit).  I spread the green beans into a pam coated class 13 x 8.  Covered with a layer of Sam's club brand bacon bits (more like chunks).  Covered with cheese.  I make extra of the cracker/butter mix, plus I crush up some Fresj Gourmet Crispy Jalapenos (like the onions.)  It was dinner!  Will make next time with left over easter ham.  I made it 'medium/mild spicey" because my son is less of a 'hot' lover than I am.   IYUM!

I made this for my husbands family Christmas dinner.   They aren’t big into trying new things but I convinced them to try it and they loved it! They even asked me to bring it again.  The only changes I made were recommendations from others to fry onions in butter and I reduced the salt by half and added garlic powder.  Oh and I used fresh steamed french green beans.

I wanted to find a green bean casserole that didn't use condensed soup, so I was happy to find this one with so many positive reviews.  But after following the instructions exactly I was unimpressed with the outcome. OK, not great.

Love this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas! Using FRESH green beans makes a world of a difference as others have commented. I also used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (a healthier option). Sharp cheddar cheese instead of regular cheddar also gave it a nice kick. It turned out great. I was looking forward to leftovers but there were none!

This was fabulous! I made a few adjustments from the comments. A little less sour cream, cooked the onions a bit and threw in 1/2 the cheese and fried onions in the mix. The rest was on top. I added fried onions along with the ritz topping......can’t have green bean casserole without them.

Doesn't even compare to the traditional green bean casserole! This one is fantastic! Everyone who tries it loves it. I have already made this 5 times and will continue to make it over and over again! The recipe doesn't need any adjustments, it's perfect just the way it is!

I made this for the first time this thanksgiving. I wanted an alternate recipe for the normal green bean casserole because my husband and I don’t like mushrooms. I thought it was great! I just want to kick up the seasoning next time. I saw one review suggesting to add some salt, pepper and garlic powder so I will be trying that out for Christmas. I will definitely be making this for many holidays to come!

I followed the suggestions of using fresh green beans steamed in chicken stock, and also cooking the onions in the butter first.  I also added a lot more crackers on top (some just crumbled without added butter).  The dish was a hit!

Excellent dish for Thanksgiving, followed combo of others and used 2 pounds fresh steamed whole green beans, reduced sour cream to 3/4, used Cabot shredded sharp cheddar and mixed 1/2 with dish, layered half on top, used (1) large French's fried onions and also mixed half and layered half on top. prepped the night before then followed instructions and baked on Thanksgiving day, was delish! liked much better then the cream of mushroom one.

Excellent recipe and great upgrade to the usual greenbean casserole. Only comments I would make are that 2 cups of cheese may be a bit much. As I was putting that layer on, it felt excessive. But, I only had a few ounces left, so I used it all. Next time, I may try using closer to a cup. The cheese to bean ratio seemed slightly off. Also, I like a crispy top, so I doubled the cracker mixture. Worked out well. Also, I went ahead and crushed equal amounts Ritz crackers AND French fried onions, to give it some of that traditional appeal. Buttering the topping ensured it came out crispy, not mushy. Received lots of compliment on the dish.

Once you have this version you will never eat the cream of mushroom version again. Many in my family refuse to eat onion so I swapped the regular onion for French fried onions and used FRESH green beans I did a quick steam on instead of canned. Of course more cheese than recommended was used but this was a delicious recipe. Big hit at Thanksgiving !

It was alright, but not worth the additional effort. I'd stick with the classic cream of mushroom and be done.

My family loves green bean casserole. I omit the flour and white sugar. I always add 1/2 or more of the 10.5oz can of cream of mushroom along with more or less of the sour cream mentioned. I also prefer Frenches Crispy Fried Onions mixed in with the creamy mixture of French cut green  beans. This recipe is a great side dish for any holiday gathering.

This is great. Not sure why you'd want t try this recipie and add a can of those nasty chemically altered "fried" onions. I sauté my onions and reduce the cheese a bit. I add some cheese in the casserole and the remaining is sprinkled on top. There's usually no much leftover. I need to remember to double the recipie!

We've made this recipe every year for the last five years for Thanksgiving! It's the best green bean casserole I have come across!  We don't make any changes to the recipe at all!  It's perfect, and now I'm disappointed whenever I have green bean casserole made the traditional way!

Grandma must have went to Weight Watchers ;) because this is very similar to a recipe I have in a WW book from years ago. That recipe calls for 1/2 cup of sour cream and swiss cheese. Both very good though.

Making this has become our holiday tradition. The only things I do different is use 1 teas of onion powder instead of the diced onion. Also use 3/4 cup of sour cream instead of a full cup. It's a delicious, easy, no fail recipe.

Found this recipe today while looking for a hamburger/green bean/tator tot recipe. Decided to give it a try and it was fabulous! Since I had hamburger, I browned it (with the onions) and added it in. Only other changes was fresh instead of canned beans, and only half amount of salt. Complete meal!

I made this last night and it was delicious. Everyone at our party loved it and there was not even a tiny bit left. I made a few changes, I left out onions because I can't eat onions. I also don't like sour cream so I substituted ricotta cheese and fat free half and half. And I use the fat free, calorie free spray butter which worked fine with the recipe. Not big changes. It was amazing! I will definitely make it again!

This is a fantastic recipe. The creamy base is a great tasting cream base! I could imagine creamed potatoes or corn or broccoli etc.. even pasta! I did make a few changes based on ingredients I had on hand. Since I didn't have canned green beans which are softer and pre-cooked then frozen green beans, I boiled a sleeve of frozen green beans in salted water till the color change to a darker green and softer. While the green beans were boiling, I melted butter in a skillet & sautéed (bag/frozen) pre-chopped onions, celery & Green bellpepper (in the south the veggie mix is called the Holy Trinity.. the base for most dishes) till soft.. stirred in the suggested seasonings, then added the flour & stirred to incorporate into the sautéed veggies.. letting it cook a few minutes to lose the flour taste, kinda like a thick light color roux coating the veggies. It was time to add liquid.. so I stirred in light sour cream. Btw I didn't measure anything just eyed everything but using the recipe as a standard. At this point I tasted the sour cream sauce and knew this was going to be a KEEPER. In a medium casserole dish mixed the beans & sauce & used some preshredded Italian cheese blend from a tub purchased from Sams club. And also shredded some cheddar to the top. Then mixed the crushed butter crackers into small amount of melted butter & sprinkled that over the top of the dish. Baked it at 350.. anyway I love this recipe & forget the canned mushroom soup, this is far better.

The cracker crumbles gave this a great crunch and the cheese was good, but it still tasted like canned green beans. Personally, I hate green beans and want my casserole to mask them as much as possible.

Changed a few little things used a little less flower, sautéed onions before mixing the ingredients, added half the cheese to the mixture, and used half crackers half fried onions. Amazing!

This has become a staple for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone who has ever tasted this casserole has asked for the recipe.  I make no changes as it's perfect as is.

I got lots of compliments on this.  I added part of the cheese to beans, threw in some fried onions with the beans ad mixed with cracker topping. I probably only used a heavy cup of cheese.  Will make often. Ty

I added some extra crackers and butter on the top. It was a great hit for the family Christmas dinner and everyone wanted the recipe.  Nice for a change from the regular green bean casserole and cheese is always a hit.

Really good. I made it with fresh green beans. Cooked the beans and left the cheese and cracker topping off until the beans cooked a little then added the toppings after about 20 min.

Made according to the recipe except for using fresh green beans, and it was wonderful except for the cheese on top.  That is too much cheddar and hardened when cooled a bit on the table.  Next time I will use just a bit (maybe couple tablespoons)  of fresh grated Parmesan added to the buttery crackers for the topping.  I boiled the fresh green beans in salted water for about 20 minutes and drained them well.

I am not a  good cook, but this was easy and was well liked. Tripled the recipe for a large gathering.  Followed advice to saute the onions and add half of the cheese into the bean mixture, and add French's Onions to the topping. Everyone liked it and none was left.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!!!   A few  things I did differently......I used an extra can of beans and only used one cup of cheese but I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to the sour cream mixture.  My family loved it and I'll definitely make it again!

I was very skeptical of this recipe since this is a staple at Thanksgiving and the recipe I usually  use (and is a huge hit) I couldn't find.  I was nervous but this was gobbled up and we actually ran out.  No leftovers and people were complaining they wanted more!  This is a keeper!

Great recipe- I added thyme, salt, pepper and instead of cheddar cheese, used fresh shredded  mussarela and parmesan cheese. I also made my own homemade sour cream from All Recipes as well! Guests finished it at all!

I don't like green beans and have never made green bean casserole. But in a panic for another veggie side dish for Thanksgiving, we turned to this recipe because of the simple directions/ingredient list and the rave reviews. It did not disappoint!!  So quick to throw together - we used home canned green beans we had in storage - and everyone loved it!! (I'll admit it wasn't half bad, despite the fact I don't like green beans.) Also loved that it doesn't use cream soup - which allowed me to sub plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, thereby making it edible for my lactose intolerant family members.  Will definitely be making this again, but I suspect it would taste even better with fresh green beans over canned.

This was super easy and delicious. I made it gluten and dairy free by using Toffuti Better Than Sour Cream for the sour cream. For the crackers, I mixed corn flakes with butter and salt. It turned out very delicious! Great easy recipe.

This was an amazing recipe-sort of like the green bean version of a great broccoli and cheese casserole.  It turned out amazingly well.  I did add a bit more onion (I used about 1/2 cup of diced Vidalia onion).  Yum!  Loved it!

I have made this twice now. The first time, I made it as written. I give a 3 based on the written recipe. The second time, I changed it a tad. First, I cooked the onions; I think they are gross and too crunchy if you don't. Also, I increased the butter used to sauté to about 3 tablespoons. I added garlic with the onions, cooked them, then added the flour. The remaining steps I followed except I mixed the cheese in with the beans instead of keeping it only on the top. I also mixed fried onions in with the cracker topping. The second round of making this, with those changes, made it much better I feel.

Just received a lot of compliments for this one at a friendsgiving!  I made a few adds to the green bean mix - a can of cream of mushroom soup, crispy french onions, and half the cheese.  Also, added crispy french onions to the top.  Will be making again!

I'm not much of a cook but we were assigned the green bean casserole for Thanksgiving. I read a ton of the reviews and made many of the changes mentioned. First, let me say that it tastes better than casseroles made with cream of mushroom soup.  Everyone like it, even the kids. I doubled the recipe and put the mixture in a 13", 2" deep casserole pan. I used three 24oz cans of French style beans. I reduced sour cream to 3/4 cup (1.5 cups total) and it really could have been reduced a little further. I was very creamy and rich. I sautéed the onions in the butter before adding other ingredients. I added a little more than 1 tsp of garlic powder and cut the salt slightly. I used very sharp cheddar and mixed half of it into the mix and put the rest on top. I also mixed in some French fried onions and added some to the topping also (didn't even use a whole small container). I did also add the crushed Ritz butter crackers on top and I would add even more next time because it added great crunch and flavor. I will definitely make this again next year.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  My family is not a huge fan of the traditional green bean casserole (with the cream soup and french fried onions)...but we've always had it on the buffet anyway.  lol  I was in charge of the green bean casserole this year and tried this recipe instead.  I doubled the cracker topping for more crunch and everyone loved it!  This was the first time the green bean casserole was all gone at the end of the night!

These beans were really tasty. I substituted 1.5 lb fresh steamed beans for the canned beans. Although I appreciated the not so mushy beans, my family wasn't too keen on the fresh ones. Next time, I'll stick to the recipe and see how it goes.

Loved this, used steamed fresh green beans. Mixed fried onions pieces and cheddar cheese into the beans, doubled sauce. Topped it with extra cheddar cheese, Ritz crackers and more fried green onions.

i made this for Thanksgiving yesterday. it's really easy and super yummy! I used crushed round butter crackers (no melted butter mixture) for the topping, as well as a ton (actually a whole brick) of cheddar cheese. I really like cheese. I love this recipe because it doesn't call for cream of whatever soup!

My hubs loves green bean casserole and asked me to make it as a side dish for Thanksgiving. I looked through a few recipes but this one had so many great reviews, I decided to try it and it was a hit. He is so picky about what he will eat as his Mom made this throughout his childhood. He said that this was the best green bean casserole he has ever tasted and that made me very happy. So here is what I changed based on the feedback from other reviewers:
1. Sauteed the onions in butter first, then added the flour, salt, etc.
2. Steamed the green beans but left a little crunch
3. Used less sour cream - 3/4 cup
4. Used less than 2 cups of cheese
5. Used fried onions instead of the crackers

It as delicious and tasted very homemade!

Super good - exactly what I was looking for in terms of wanting a base for a "classic" green bean casserole recipe but even better! Followed some suggestions and cooked the onions in the butter before adding flour and spices. Was out of white sugar so I subbed brown in a pinch. Added garlic powder and black pepper. Delicious!

Love love love this recipe! I make the green bean casserole for Thanksgiving every year.  Last year I switched it up to this recipe and everyone loved it!  Among the comments were that they liked the slight tang of the sour cream rather than the heavy richness of the cream soup and I have to agree.  I did as others suggested and added a little black pepper, garlic powder, reduced the cheese, and used French fried onions instead of the cracker topping (I'd be disowned if our green bean casserole didn't have those on it!). Just finished making it again for tomorrow's feast.  Thank you!

This was a delicious, and a huge hit at Friendsgiving! I've never made a green bean casserole before so I was looking for a no-fail recipe that wouldn't disappoint, and wasn't just the plain ol' canned cream soup version.

I found this on all recipes about 5 years ago and have made it every thanksgiving and christmas since. My family of 20 loves it! I did saute the onions first. I subbed plain greek yogurt for the sour cream and did half butter crackers and half french fried onions for the topping. Wonderful!!

I've made this many times with fresh/frozen/canned green beans and fresh/frozen broccoli too. If using fresh or frozen veggies, I just cook or steam them before hand. Only differences: I sauté the onions first, use half the amount of salt the recipe calls for, and sometimes, if I run out of sour cream, I'll use 1/2-3/4cup sour cream and 1/4-1/2cup cream cheese and that is great too. I'll throw in cayenne every once in a while for a little kick if I'm making it for adults only and no kiddos. This is the only casserole my family wants at Thanksgiving and Christmas!

This is so good! so much better than the cream of mushroom soup recipes. I do add the fried onions instead of crushed crackers because I love those but i am sure it is just fine with the cracker topping.

I made this last year when I hosted my first American thanksgiving. I have never had the "easy made" green bean casserole before, so I did not know this was not the "traditional" way to make it. But my guests and I LOVED it. I used fresh green beans but made the recipe as written. This has been requested again this year. Thanks

My family is not too crazy about the green bean casserole with the mushroom soup and French fried onions.  So... I decided to give this a try!   They loved it!   It was the first dish at our family reunion that was completely gone!

I make it for 400+ guests every year. Because of the quantities, I use cut green beans, extra sharp cheddar cheese, and throw in a pinch of pepper and granulated garlic.

We preferred this over the traditional. I used Treder Joes haricots vert they are thin green beans and I steamed them for 8 minutes. I used Trader Joe's canned fried onions instead of the onion and added some to the topping. I stirred some shredded Parmesan into bean mixture. Biggest lesson learned; Needs more sauce. Next time I'll make 1.5 to 2x more. Will use this from now on instead of the goopy mushroom soup version.

OMG!  This recipe is way, WAY BETTER than the cream soup version! The fam LOVED it! I made this with fresh green beans (cooked earlier). The only thing I would do different is use less  crackers.

Our family loved it! Much more flavorful than the cream of mushroom soup version. It was a little too salty, maybe because I had no crackers so I used seasoned breadcrumbs?

So much better than the canned soup method.  I used fresh green beans and sautéed onions and mushrooms. I've made this twice.  Rave reviews from family.

I thought this was good but a bit salty. Next time I will omit the salt altogether. The other ingredients in the recipe give it enough of the salty flavor it needs.

This is the ONLY green bean casserole you will ever need to make. Holy moly! I make this every year for Thanksgiving, and any other meal I can find an excuse to make it for. It's perfect and totally approachable. Always a HUGE hit.

I discovered this recipe two years ago on the 16th birthday of a nephew for whom I had forgotten to purchase a gift. As an uncle in good standing I didn't want to arrive without a gift so I asked his mother for suggestions. She told me green bean casserole was his favorite, was quick and easy to make, and suggested I make it for him. To say I don't like green bean casserole would be an enormous understatement! I never cared for this dish. But, I was out of time and unwilling to arrive empty handed so I girded my loins and headed for the pantry. No canned French onions! What to do? Search the internet for a crunchy French onion recipe. Yes, that's it. What a surprise! I thought the "classic" cream of mushroom and canned French onion topping recipe WAS green bean casserole. It never occurred to me there were other recipes. I had all the ingredients for Amy's recipe so....Everyone loved it! Especially my nephew!  And it still surprises me when I say "I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE". More accurately, I love THIS green bean casserole. Thank you Amy!!!

Our family has loved these green beans at Thanksgiving for the past few years. Since my family has never cared for the typical green bean casserole we always opted for a different vegetable dish at Thanksgiving. That is until I came across this recipe. We make it exactly as written and I have been asked to share the recipe many times.

Very good green beans. I added the buttery cracker topping using Keebler's buttery square crackers and the Durkee's French fried onions. These green beans were a hit at my husband's birthday party. I also made 3 other recipes from all recipes to serve at the party with these wonderful green beans. The cheesy potatoes, the cheesy potatoes with ham and the carrot cake 3. They were all 5 star recipes and made my party a success.

Thank you, Amy, for sharing your recipe!  This is sooo much better than the same old green bean casserole that everyone has made for years!  I'm so tired of that one that I don't even put it on my plate anymore.  I followed the recipe the first time I made this and it was great!  The next time I wanted leftovers so I used 1.5 times the ingredients, used 5 cans of beans, omitted the sugar and cracker topping.  I topped it with some of the cheddar and mixed  the rest of the cheese into the mixture.  Also added some sauteed portobello mushrooms.  Made it last night and already I'm looking forward to making it again!

Toss away the canned soup recipe. This one is the best hands down. I used crushed seasoned salad cru on top and only 1/2 the cheese and frozen green beans steamed instead of the french cut canned. I also added a small canned of sliced mushrooms too. It was Awesome everyone loved it and ask for me to make it all the time we have family get togethers.

I've made this the past two years for thanksgiving, and everyone that's had it, simply LOVES it. I don't use fresh beans as some people suggest, but I will say; you HAVE to use french cut, otherwise it just doesn't come out properly.

I have tried several recipes, but this hands down is one of the best. Do not alter the recipe at all, it is perfect as is. I had never attempted to make green bean casserole before for the holidays. To my surprise my guests went wild and begged me for the recipe...I told them that it was my grandmothers recipe (not my proudest moment!).  I have made it several times since, and it still commands the same response, people absolutely love this.

Made almost as is, except I used 4 cans of the green beans, used french's fried onions instead and added them in the casserole as well as on top. Came out excellent.

This recipe was amazing considering I don't like green been casserole. And my husband is the traditional mushroom soup one. When I told him I was making it different he was not happy. I did any way and he begs me to make it this way ALL THE time and I love it too. I did use dried onions vs the diced. And I did mix some of the cheese in with the green beens and topped with more dried onions! So simple and delicious. Definitely a family favorite!

This is my "go to" green bean casserole recipe. It's easy & tastes great.  I put about half of the shredded cheese in it & the rest on top of it.

I did not make this recipe exactly as is the first time, but I figured I would still offer feedback.

I read some of the reviews before making this. I was looking for a good base recipe to make green bean casserole from scratch, and this is excellent.

I followed some suggestions and reduced the salt by half, and sautéed the onions, which really makes a difference. I also removed the rue from the heat before adding the sour cream, and then added the green beans to coat them.

I made the rue with the measured amounts of butter, flour, sugar, and sour cream, and half the salt. I kinda winged it with the amount of onion, green beans, cheese, and crackers, and extra ingredients. I had the ratio of green beans to 'sauce' enough to be very well coated, but not too much.

I added my own twist to the recipe and used freshly steamed green beans, sautéed fresh crushed garlic with the onions, added mushrooms (steamed with the green beans) and crumbled bacon. I put some of the cheese into the mixture to get the cheesy flavour right through, and saved some of the crumbled bacon for the topping. I kind of winged it with the amount of cheese as I didn't want to overdo it. 

The casserole is not wet and soggy, but has a moist consistency that holds the beans together well that it's not sloppy when put on a plate. The cheese with the cracker crumbs on top makes for a nice crispy crunchy topping.

In all this is a great base recipe for making this dish from scratch. It is very simple and perfe

I've made the traditional mushroom soup recipe, with Velveeta and French's fried onions, for many years, and after trying this I will never go back to that old recipe! I did add about half of the cheese to the green beans the 2nd time, rather than putting it all top, and we prefer it that way. Super good!

We liked this much better than the traditional soup and fried onions casserole. Great flavor and the topping cooks up yummy..  I'm not a fan of canned cream of anything soup so this was perfect. Makes a really large quantity and doesn't really seem as good the next day tho', the smooth textures gets rather chunky. Needs a more seasoning for our taste so I added a more pepper and some garlic salt.

A nice twist from the classic with cream of mushroom soup....it was a huge hit at our family Thanksgiving dinner.  Would do it again, with a little less sour cream.

This is my favorite go to green bean casserole.  My kids LOVE it and it is the only one I make.  I use fresh green beans steamed and then make it as the recipe states.  I use more cheese and more sour cream to  make it creamer since the beans are whole and I use a large amount.  I saute the onions until soft in the butter and then add the flour to make the roux.  
It is amazing.!

This came out so good!  Loved it!  Changes: I used a mixture of mozzarella along with fresh parmesan and store bought bread crumbs only because that's what I had on hand and my goal is usually to use what I have!  Also, I did sautéed the onions as others suggested and sprinkled with pepper and "Slap ya Mama" spice". I need HEAT in all I EAT!  ;)

Awesome! Added garlic, sautéed the onions in butter first and then added the flour, sugar, salt, sour cream and green beans. Best green bean casserole recipe, love there is no canned cream soups in it.

We absolutely love this green bean casserole.  It's so much better than the old stand by.  I did make a couple of changes:  I used about half an onion instead of just 1/4 cup and sauteed it in the butter before adding the flour.  I also added half of the cheese to the green bean mixture before pouring it into the baking dish and topping with the other half of the cheese.

Delicious! I did not leave out any ingredients but I did add more cheese and breadcrumbs to give it some more crunchiness! I used some organic green beans from my fiancé's family farm and used Italian breadcrumbs instead!  Remember to cook the green beans before you even preheat, if not the whole casserole will be watery or at least make sure they are we drained!

Amazing! Tasted delicious! The one thing I did mess up on is I purchased all three cans as unsweetened beans. It was a bit unsalty. I should've done 2 salty and one unsalty. It's okay...next time. My father in laws favorite dish!

After reading reviews I slow cooked onions and butter for 10 min on low heat but I'm from the south and needed a but more seasoning for my family this thanksgiving. I added Lawrey's (any Cajun seasoning will do) to taste while cooking all ingredients before putting into casserole dish and adding crumbs/butter. My stepdad raved about it and compares it as a favorite side dish next to my moms Mac and Cheese (her family holiday staple).

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday. I make the "classic" version every year (with the canned condensed soup), but wanted to try something different. This recipe is fantastic! I sautéed the onions in butter with some sliced mushrooms and garlic. I used French fried onions in the casserole, as well as on top. I only had sharp cheddar cheese, so that is what I used. Next time I will use a mild cheddar or perhaps fontina. My husband liked this version a lot better than the "classic," which is really saying something! Looks like this will be on all of our holiday menus from now on.

This recipe is amazing!  Best green beans I have ever had.  I used the Cabot cheese as suggested, and added some of the dried onions into the body and on the top with the crackers.  This recipe is extremely good, but it is a matter of taste.  I was completely happy with 2 cups of cheese (which I put 1 cup in the body and 1 on top.  One of my guests thought it was too cheesy, so for him I would cut it to 1 or  1 1/2c.  The great thing is, you can't go wrong with this one!   Thank you for sharing!!!!1

Never liked traditional green bean casserole, but this dish was so yummy. The ritz crackers does wonders for this dish.

While so many other reviewers have claimed that you need to sauté the onions beforehand, I found that this recipe was perfect just the way that it was written. The onions were soft in it, and it was very creamy. I did double the amount of buttery crackers that I put on top of it because I love a crunchy topping on a casserole, and I added French fried onions because I love them. Other than that, I did everything just as the recipe said to do. Last year, I made a very complicated green bean casserole for Thanksgiving dinner. This year, I made this one. It was super easy to make and delicious!

I don't really like green bean casserole but this was delicious!!!! Followed the recipe exactly  :)
The second time I made this I carmalized the onion in the 2 tablespoons of butter then added the flour and cooked for another min then followed the recipe as written. I did not add butter to the crackers because the cheese bubbles up and forms a wonderful crust :) I have been reducing the recipe servings to 8 but from now on I'm sticking with 10  and maybe we will have left overs !

Made this today for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! I couldn't use the buttery crackers due to a gluten issue, so I ground up some walnuts and mixed with the melted butter. After baking, I turned on the broiler to get the walnut mixture crisped.

This is a keeper for sure.

Love this recipe! I make it anytime I get a chance. It's different from traditional green bean casserole which makes it even better! I do sauté the onions and add garlic.  I also mix the cheese (using cheddar, asiago, and colby) with the green beans plus I mix in dried onions for a crunch. I top the dish with more cheese, crushed ritz and melted butter. What a fantastic outcome! We can't get enough. Make sure to add some spice too!

Did 2 lbs fresh green beans snapped, 1.5 tbsp flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and added pepper.  Added Swiss to the mix...not sure if I will do that next time ??.

I was going to use a different recipe until I found this one. So I didn't have any sour cream. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead. I also followed other revisions people on commented; garlic powder, pepper, and used french fried onions instead of fresh. Delicious! I will make this again!

Very good, but still like the mushroom soup recipe.  Added garlic powder to the sour cream mixture.  Mixed part of the cheese in with the beans, etc.  Saw no need for the flour, butter, and sugar so did not use it and I was right it didn't need it.  When I make again I will top with the fried onions.

I tried this recipe because, it looked very similar to my Grandmothers. I liked it but I tweaked it a little. Squeezed a little lemon just, added some garlic salt, and substituted chedder with a swiss layer.

Outstanding! Seeing the few ingredients I went into this with low expectations and was blown away.  I wished I had made more! The only thing I'll do differently next time is use a softer cheese. I found the jack was a little hard, maybe a gruyere or jack-melts better.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I made this recipe based on the positive reviews, but was a little scared.  I've never had cheese on green beans before and it just didn't sound right to me.  But, it was a surprisingly good combination.  I'll make this again especially when we want something different than the norm.

Great go-to holiday recipe for beans.  Works really well as is - No need to modify or add to it.  Also, it does work well with regular cut green beans instead of the "French Cut" beans.

My friends and family enjoyed this recipe with a couple of changes and additions.  Since there was no seasoning I added some and made a few other changes.  First of all, I parboiled two 16-oz. small bags of cut green beans instead of using the canned green beans.  I sautéed the onion in the butter before adding the flour.  I also added the following the sauce:  approximately ½ cup of half n half, 1/8 tsp. garlic granules, ¼ tsp. Mrs. Dash Tableblend seasoning and 1/8 tsp. ground pepper.  Overall this is a good recipe that you can start with and twist to satisfy your family.

After reading the reviews, I thought "why not try something new?" It was great and I love that it holds together and isn't soupy like the usual green bean casserole.

I did everything as directed, except a couple of things: I sliced the onions (instead of diced) and I let them cook a bit before I added the sour cream to the skillet. I eyeballed how much cheese I put on top, but it definitely wasn't 2 cups (maybe 1 cup). And I left some bigger pieces of crackers instead of crumbling it all. Other than that, I folowed as directed.

*Keep in mind, while this makes 10 servings, the dish was finished by 5 people. We had it alongside ham and 2 other delicious sides.

Was a bit sceptical of this at first, but am very glad we tried it!! I'm not a fan of cream of mushroom soup, so was happy to find this recipe. The only thing I may try different next time is adding some of those crunchy onion things!!

I made this casserole for company a few weeks ago.  They loved it and took home some of the leftovers, as it made more than we needed!  I am also making it as a side for my Christmas dinner.  You can prepare it ahead of time and then throw it in the oven for half an hour while your turkey is resting and then being carved!  Delish!

I love the traditional cream of mushroom soup recipe, but this was even better!  It was easy to do and didn't take too long either.  I will definitely make this version of green bean casserole from now on.

A surprise hit at Thanksgiving! It didn't really look like anything special to be honest, but when my guests got a taste, they all loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. Loved the sour-cream and buttery flavors.

I tried to make this and realized I had run out of most of the ingredients, so I improvised. Even with my failure to have the right ingredients, it was very good. I added garlic with the onions which I cooked before adding the flour. I didn't have sour cream, so I used half milk and half cream cheese. The cream cheese made it divine. Even with all my substitutions it was very good and as soon as I make it with butter and some cheddar, I'm sure it will be fantastic. I do have to recommend adding garlic and cream cheese for a little extra flavor. The melted butter (or oil) over the topping makes a big difference.

Delicious - this recipe is so wonderful and addicting. You have been warned! I sautéed the onions and didn't use as much flour (only about 1/4 Tbsp.) It turned out fantastic! I highly recommend EVERYONE to try this! No leftovers!

I prepared this dish last night made it exactly like the recipe and the add-ons from other readers. We had a 50/50 response  the main complaint was it's to salty, next time if I make it again will omit the "caned onions" change the cheese to White (yellow cheese is to salty ) omit the salt and maybe boost up the spices garlic powder other wise is was good but not a 5 stare dish.

I made this for a small "preT-day" meal for my husband and myself. I scaled the recipe down for 3-4 servings (whatever it took to get it down to one can of beans). It was delicious! I hate mushrooms (like I don't even want to be in the same county while someone is cooking them), but have always suffered through making the traditional casserole. I'm thrilled to have a new alternative. Now I'm just gong to have to resist making this all the time cause it'd kill my diet if I served it as often as I'd like. Oh, and as a bonus, it worked great  as the creamy veg element of the filling when I made the leftovers from the meal into pot pies. Those were so yummy, I served them two days in a row! THANKS so much for sharing!!

This recipe turned out great, but I made a LOT of changes based on the reviews. I used more onion (1/2 of an onion) and sauteed it and some minced garlic in the butter before adding the flour. I omitted the sugar because I didn't see the point of it and also added a little extra salt, plus some pepper and Worcestshire sauce. I cut the sour cream down to 1/2 cup and mixed 1 cup of cheese in with the green beans, then only used 1/2 cup of cheese on the top. Next time I might also try using fresh steamed green beans (but the canned tasted just fine). I think mushrooms would have been really yummy as well. The way I made it was delicious. I love the IDEA of this recipe (I was trying to get away from the creamed soup and canned onions), but it needed some work.

Made this as a side for Thanksgiving, but I tweaked it a bit by adding a kick.  To those who prefer less bland green bean casserole, try adding a TBLSPN of Worchestshire and a few dashes of curry!  And French-fried Onions on top of the cheese.   Yums.

Followed the recipe, but used fresh green beans rather than canned -- it was fantastic!  You can bet I will be making this dish again!  I might add diced baby bella mushrooms next time.

Everyone I served for Thanksgiving was used to the traditional cream of mushroom...This was a huge hit with everyone!!! I did use the french fried onions in place of the crackers and fresh onions. Only because I didn't have crackers.... it was still great

Everyone in my family liked this at Thanksgiving. I followed someone's suggestion to use Cabote cheese, but I used only half what was called for. I also used fresh green beans, using my Cuisanart's slicing blade to french them. The recipe is very rich, but delicious. This will be a tradition at our house from now on.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated minus 1/4 tsp. of the salt. All 3 members of my family didn't like it. They said there was way too much sour cream. I am a vegan so I didn't try any but decided to make it again using vegan sour cream and cheese. I didn't mind it but I did feel that it called for too much sour cream. If I make this again I will omit the sour cream and use almond milk to make a basic white sauce instead.

For some reason, I thought this would be similar to the "original" green bean casserole. It's not even close. First off, the sour cream overpowers the dish - that's pretty much all I could taste. Then the shredded cheese is on top and pretty much melts on the top area. And the round cracker & butter topping - ick! I will NOT be making this ever again. . Nothing to write home about. Yuck!

Excellent! I hate mushrooms, so I never like the "traditional" green bean casserole. I made this for thanksgiving and my niece and nephew were fighting over who got the last spoonful and my brother asked me to make some more to have with leftovers.
I did do a couple of tweaks... I sauteed the onions in the butter a bit before adding the flour, used frozen instead of canned green beans, mixed some of the cheese in with the GB mixture instead of putting it all on top and used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers.
I WILL be making this again!

This was well-received although it didn't get raves.  It is definitely superior to that canned soup and fried onion variety!  Easy to make and I will do it again, guaranteed!

I hate regular green bean cassarole but I loved this. I used fresh green beans, caramelized the onions, used Swiss cheese and French fried onions. Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.

My family really enjoyed this recipe! After mixing in the beans it seemed too creamy so I added another can of beans and some French fried onions and it was delicious. I used two cans cut green beans and two cans French style.

Gone are the days of mushy canned soup casserole!  This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. I used two pounds of fresh steamed string beans instead of canned, and I sautéed the onion before adding the flour.  I also added a bit of garlic. My family loves this dish.  Thanks for sharing Amy Barry.

I have used this recipe for the past 3 Thanksgivings. This year I made a few adjustments and it was over the top! I used Cabot Seriously Sharp White Cheddar to mix in the and top the green beans. I also used french fried onions since that is my husband's favorite part of a green bean casserole. Like many reviewers have mentioned, make sure to cook the onions in butter until they are translucent.  Once you try this recipe, whether you alter it or not, you'll never go back to nasty mushroom green bean casserole!

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  For the first time ever my husband complimented the green bean casserole and asked for second.  This is so much better than the canned soup kind!

I made GB casserole under duress because my family loves the back-of-the-soup version so much. I made this and it was a huge hit. Better in every way than the cans and just as easy. I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect. Next time, I might do less sour cream/cheese - but for Thanksgiving the extra gooey-ness was a great treat. Thanks!

Outstanding! I used Trader Joe's frozen haricort vert, roasted corn and added sliced crimini mushrooms sauteed with onions. It was the best "traditional" Thanksgiving veggie casserole ever.

This is exactly the same recipe that I have been making for years and my kids always ask for it.  Only two differences:  We call it "Gran's Green Bean Casserole" and instead of crumbled crackers we use Special K cereal.  Try it.

This is a nice alternative to the traditional green bean casserole with canned french fried onions and canned soup.  I tried it almost exactly as written, except I used frozen green bea. I think that using frozen or fresh green beans also improves the flavor over canned. Actually, I made one more substitution, based on what I had on hand:  I used bread crumbs coated with butter instead of the crackers.  I was surprised that even the small amount of sugar in the recipe added a hint of sweetness that was both subtle and interesting.  As others have mentioned, the result is a bit thick, so I added a little of the water in which the green beans had been steamed to thin the white sauce (since it is made with sour cream rather than milk, the dominant flavor is still that of white sauce made with milk).

YUM! I brought this side dish to my daughter's first Thanksgiving dinner in her new home. It came out so much better than using condensed soup for the sauce! I did saute the onions in the butter before adding the flour, and added a little pepper for my own taste. Everyone enjoyed the dish!

This is much better than the mushroom soup recipe. I've made it twice and both times were asked for the recipe. I do prefer it with 1 cup of cheese mixed in with the beans and 1 cup on top. I also cook the onions in butter before adding it. For a smaller family it also works with just 2 cans of French style green beans, instead of 3.

Made it for Thanksgiving this year. The whole family absolutely loved it! I especially love that it is not made with condensed cream of anything soup! It is delicious. I topped it off with french fried onions, because that's what I had on hand, but no doubt it's just as great with any topping. (Also, halved the salt and flour like others suggested.)

I checked some other reviews and used 3/4 cup sour cream and added some pepper. I also added water chestnuts upon request. I only used about 1 1/4 cups cheese and mixed some in the dish. Went over very well at Thanksgiving dinner.

The only thing that I did differently is I sauteed the onions before I added the flour. Oh, and I also added some fried onions to the top because they're delicious and I felt like I needed more onion flavor. This turned out really great, though. Made it for T-Day and it went quick!

Amazing!  I followed advice of others to sauté onions first and also mixed in 1 c of cheese with the bean mixture.  I also used a little extra cheese and crackers on top because I have some major cheese heads to please.  Even without tinkering, this is the only GB casserole recipe I'll ever use again.

I made this as it called for, nice flavor, it was super simple and easy, however I sautéed the onions with the butter as I noticed others suggested, I will defiantly make this again but will cut back on the flour and sour cream as others suggested. Thanks for sharing !!

Based on the ingredients I really thought that I would have liked this. I ate a few green beans before putting them in the pan and they were good, but the cheese on top just ruined the whole thing. It could be that my taste buds are just off from all the other food I ate durning that meal, but I did not like it, nor did the rest of my family.

This is amazing!! it did not last long. I did make some changes though, first off I used fresh steamed green beans and then I sauted the onions in a small skillet with oil before I put them in the big skillet and I also didn't put crackers on top because of allergy's but I definitely recommend it!

Signed up just so I could review this. Excellent!! The only changes I made was I added some diced bacon, Yum! I also caramelized the onions. mixed it up in a crock pot to save the oven space at my moms where I took it for Thanksgiving. I should have bought another can because it was gone so fast. The one problem I had was the hot butter and the flour didn't get along to well. Instant goop! Next time I will try skipping the flour .

Delicious and super easy to make! I, too, steamed about 2lbs of green beans first, and mixed some cheese and fried onions into it in addition to topping it all off. Delicious!!

Two stars because the recipe as is is not good! Main thing as you'll read in other reviews is to cook the onions in the butter before adding the flour. Reduce the flour a bit and add half the cheese into the casserole and te other half on top. The best life changing suggestion go can make based on the recipe my family has year for years is to add bacon and canned mushrooms Ino the mix as well! AMAZING !!!!!

I think it's probably a great dish but the real "Green Bean Casserole" is a perfect, not too rich dish that goes so well with Thanksgiving dinner, why try to improve on perfection? Call this one: Cheesy, Buttery,Green Beans Casserole.

This is great!  I took the suggestions of others and sauteed the onion and some minced garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe. I think the buttered crackers make all the difference.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

LONG time favorite in our family.  The only difference is that we top the beans with corn flakes and sprinkle with a little butter before baking.  Also, you can up the beans to 4 cans and cut the sour cream in half - better yet, substitute some Greek yogurt for a little lighter dish!

Thought this recipe looked good, I am not a big fan of green bean casserole, but this seemed to be ok.  Made the sauce and discovered I had no green beans in the house, but did have 3 cans of whole kernal corn.  Made everything else per recipe.  It was great!!!.  I  will definately make this again using corn, so much better than beans.

I love this recipe! I love green bean casserole, but sadly I have a mushroom allergy. So when I stumbled onto this recipe that didn't call for mushroom soup, I knew I had to give it a try. I followed some suggestions to cook the onions ahead of time before the baking and found that worked out really well. I like to make this recipe ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator overnight, since I tend to make this for Thanksgiving/Christmas. It saves me time the next day and I can just throw it in when I'm ready. My family loves this recipe, and I continue to get special requests for this casserole. Thank you for sharing!

We loved this dish. I did make a few changes. I put 3/4 cup of sour cream (like mentioned before), fresh green beans, doubled the onions (we love onions here :) ), added garlic powered and used French Fried Onions for the topping instead of crackers. Next time I will use fresh garlic (I was lazy).

This recipe was good and fairly easy to make. I needed a dish for a large family gathering. Everyone loved it! My mom doesn't like traditional green bean casserole (made with mushroom soup) and watched skeptically as I was preparing it, but even she thought it was good. An added plus, as my sister told me, is that it tastes even better the next day!

I really liked this. I was prepared to make the standard casserole for the holidays, but found this recipe and made it from scratch. I used smart balance instead of butter, lowfat sourcream, and not as much cheese. I also crumbled french onions into the mix. This had great flavor.

The only changes I made to this recipe was using fresh-cut green beans (make sure you trim and blanch them) and I used Greek Yogurt instead of the sour cream.  It was fantastic, definitively a do again recipe in my book.

Rave reviews every time I made this recipe for company. Great thanks  to Amy Barry for submitting this recipe. Due to an allergy I am pleased to be able to use a lactose free sour cream and gluten free bread crumbs. On my third time I omitted the flour as made it too thick. Sautéed the onions  first and worked better for me. I used less cheese each time and still a hit.

Much better than the canned soup version, though I'd add a little milk so it's creamier.

I made this recipe yesterday.  My only onion was bad, so I replaced the fresh onion with the canned crispy fried onion.  But followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out surprisingly good.  I feel it is better than when I make green bean casserole with soup!

Best green bean casserole...hands down! Taste fresh! Not like a canned condensed soup! Made it for Thanksgiving and then again for Christmas. Even the kids loved it. For Christmas I added fried onions to the top.

This was a great dish, much better than with cream of mushroom soup. I still used fried onions for the top because the onion flavor for me is a must. It is not a dish if you hate sour cream, but if you do love it this dish is perfect. Give it a try.

Try doubling the crackers (with butter) for more crunch

This is a great twist to the usual green bean dish served. I made at thanksgiving and everyone requested again for Christmas. I did three things differently: used fresh steamed green beans, added two cans of reduced sodium cream of mush soup and cut down some of the cheese. Delicious.

This is a great alternative to the cof mush soup recipe. I read the reviews first & followed the recipes but sauteed the onions first, used frozen g. beans (i hate french style) that I steamed, cut back on the salt, added pepper, & used about a cup of cheese. I topped with french fried onions only because I didn't have breadcrumbs. Everyone loved this dish! I def recommend cooking the onions & going lighter on the cheese!

Too much sour cream in this recipe. But otherwise a great variation of green bean casserole. I'm going to make it again. I don't like most green bean casseroles because I avoid cream of chicken/mushroom soups like the plague and don't like the traditional French onions on top. This recipe solves both of these problems.

This is a great twist on the original version of Green Bean Casserole with the fried onions. The family absolutely thought this was their favorite dish next to the Perfect Turkey recipe. I will be making this more than once a year as well.

This was practically a hit-or-miss dish with my family. I followed the recipe exactly and it is nothing like your typical green bean casserole. I am giving it a three star because it wasn't bad, just not what I am use to.

This recipe was a hit at thanksgiving! I looked at some comments before and decided to saute the onions and add fresh mushrooms. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in butter until they were soft. I followed the recipe and added the shredded cheese into the green bean mixture before putting it into a casserole dish. I topped with more cheese and Panko break crumbs! It was gone in 10 minutes!

I was so excited to make this dish based on all of the great reviews, but was really disappointed with the final product. First, if using sour cream as the base in the "sauce" there is no reason to make a roux. I followed the recipe and found the sauce to be way too thick to evenly coat the beans - it was more of a paste. I added generous amounts of milk to thin the sauce, but this really didn't accomplish much. I went ahead, baked it, and crossed my fingers that the dish would at least be flavorful. Unfortunately this was not the case. I added more cheese, salt, garlic powder, milk (everything just stuck together!), some Panko for extra crunch, and baked it a little longer. These additions helped but I really think the extra cheese was what made this dish taste better. All in all, I will not be making this again.

I used no-salt added green beans and reduced the amount of salt I put in it from what the recipe calls for, and it was quite tasty.  Probably could eliminate the added salt altogether with no problems at all. Even our non-green bean casserole people liked this one.

I thought, along with my family, that this is the best way to do the traditional "green beans" for Thanksgiving. I do so much like the French's onions though that I chose to use them instead of the butter crumbs the recipe called for for the topping. I got the best of both worlds!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!! Only thing I did different was I sauteed the onions in butter before I mixed everything together. I also only used about a cup of cheddar cheese and didn't put any on top. I am a sucker for French Fried Onions so instead of the cracker topping (which I am sure is amazing) I used cheddar cheese French Fried Onions. Sooooo good. I will NEVER go back to the cream of mushroom recipe again. Can't wait to make this one for Christmas.

This was a pretty good recipe that needs a few changes IMO. First off, this was really salty. My friends all LOVED it and the pan was scraped clean, but they live on fast food and they're used to the sodium. I mixed the cheddar in with the green beans instead of making one thick cheese layer as suggested by another reviewer, and I'm glad I did. Couldn't give it five stars even though it rocked and I'll make it again. Next time I'll use 1/2 tsp. salt and enjoy it more.

This was a delicious dish! I used fresh green beans and also reduced the sour cream amount. However, I felt the green beans would need a little more moisture, because they were fresh. So, I added a touch of heavy cream as well. I also subbed fried onions. They were mixed with the green beans and on top. The green beans had the perfect bite and the fried onions added the additional flavor and salt needed. Far better than any canned soup recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and my family loved it!  The only changes I made were the ones suggested: I sauted the onions first, and took the pan off the stove before adding the sour cream.  I also added fried onions, garlic and cheese to the mix and crushed the fried onions with the cracker topping. Delicious!

It was delicious, way better than the cream of mushroom alternative. I made this exactly to the recipe (forgot the crackers, however)and the only thing that I will do this time is saute the onions more and not forget the crackers! 

Otherwise it was yummy!

Grandma, whoever you are....Thank You for sharing your version of Green Bean Casserole! It was a BIG HIT on Thanksgiving.  I have to agree with reviewer 'momma_s' in that Fresh beans are key. Now to find out how well they hold up as leftovers. I bet they'll be just as tasty!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, as one ofmourmguests requested a green bean casserole.  What a delightful change from the standard!  Everyone loved it.  I used fresh green beans, sautéed the onions and added some of the cheese to the beans and some to the top.  Best to use your own judgement on the amount.  This is certainly a keeper and will be included in my favorite holiday recipes.

This recipe was awesome, much better than the cream of mushroom variety. The only change that I made was to eliminate the chopped onions. Instead we put the french fried onions on top with the cheese. It was delicious. I also used low fat sour cream and couldn't tell the difference from regular sour cream.

Love this much better than the canned one. I did cook the onion a little before adding the rest of the ingredients so they wouldn't be raw in the dish. And, I used the french fried onions instead of the crackers. But, it was really good and I will never make the canned stuff again...it is just as easy to do it this way!!

This recipe is incredibly easy, quick, and tasty. The only thing I changed was omitting the onions (no onion fans in my household) and reducing the amount of cheese. The Ritz cracker crumbs were great for this dish and gave the top a nice crunchy texture. In the future I may use a bit more crackers. Overall a great side dish!

I personally felt it needed more spices. But I am not a fan of green beans period.  Family said it was ok as well.

We always had gren bean casserole growing up but my Mom added cooked ground sausage.  Made it extra special.  If yours is too soupy then you have added too much milk.  reduce the amount andadd the sausage and you will have a creammy, yummy side dish!

omg this is sooo good!  make this! i used 1 lb green beans cut in half and lightly steamed, 1 whole sm/med onion, whole wheat flour, about 3/4 cup sour cream, added dollops of water until it was creamy enough (not much), topped with about 1/2 cup cheese and some the herbed stuffing mix, but followed the directions. YMMV, but mine is great! mushrooms could be a good addition, too.

Well first off I must say that my review does not include tasting as I did not get to have any (it was gone before I got to it). However for aroma alone I rate this 4 stars. It smelled great and I really wanted to try it but but we were at a church pot luck and those are the breaks.

The only deviation I took from the recipe was that I used 3/4 cup of sour cream, sauteed my onions seprately, and added cheese to both the mixture and the top. I'll make it again and see if it tastes as good as it smells.

This recipe is delicious! I am a very inexperienced cook, and making it was SO easy :) My husband liked it,  although he said he prefers the cream of mushroom version better. It was all around very easy to make and very tasty too! I ended up cooking it longer than 40 min, to get that crispy top. I also took the advice of another user to use French's fried onions--- SO much easier and still great tasting!

I was never a fan on green bean casserole (It wasn't part of my childhood holiday food). I came across this recipe, tried it and fell in love. This is one of my favorite foods now. I triple the recipe for our family dinners because we love it that much. My husband who grew up on the traditional cream of mushroom casserole also prefers this. To reheat it we cover it with foil and bake it until it gets hot, then add new fried onions and crackers since the leftover ones get soggy. Excellent recipe and a holiday favorite for our ohana.  After making this recipe for a few years now the only thing I changed was sautéing the onions instead of using them raw.

I have to make this for every holiday now!  Everyone always loves it.  It tastes great leftover also.

The only mod I make is to dice the onion slightly larger than normal and not to cook it very long.  It gives a nice little crunch in the finished product that way.

Excellent flavor; better than some other recipes that I have tried which incorporated cream of mushroom soup. Add crispy fried onions to the top of the dish during last 5 to 10 min of baking.  Add an entire packet of crushed crackers to recipe as well.

Delicious!! I used this recipe for Xmas dinner and everyone l-o-v-e-d it!! I added 1 cup of chopped fresh mushrooms and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder  to add some flavor. I have never been a fan of cream of mushroom soup in green bean casserole and this is a fantastic alternative. I will definitely be making this again, and not just on the holidays.

this recipe is GOOD, however, it has a very strong sour cream taste to it (i even cut back to 3/4 cup).  i'm not sure what else it needs or what could prevent this.  nonetheless, everyone still enjoyed it

OMG! I just made this for the first time today-Christmas-and my Green Bean casserole-hating family LOVED it!  Even my parents, who have had a huge aversion to past recipes (namely, from their moms!) had multiple helpings!  Just a few minor changes, though-- I doubled the onion and cooked it with the butter before adding the flour, and I also used frozen steamed green beans.  I will have to make this again within the next week- my kids want it for breakfast!

This was the star of our Thanksgiving table.  The recipe was easy to make, and turned out so much better than the cream of mushroom soup recipe.  I did make a few minor changes.  I was a little paranoid about the sugar so I only used 1/2 tsp.  It turned out great with this amount but I will use the full amount next time.  The other change I made was to use French Fried Onions rather than the cracker crust.  They turned out great, but it could be a little too onion-y if you aren't a fan.

This recipe is amazing; I make it all the time. I add garlic (3-4 cloves) and double the onions though, and add black pepper and a bit of cayenne for seasoning as well. I also mix most of the cheese in with the green beans and then just sprinkle about a 1/2 cup or so over the top. And, 1 tbsp of melted butter for the crumb topping isn't nearly enough; I usually go with about 2 or 3. I've found that after these changes to an already great recipe, it is ridiculously awesome.

I thought this was very good and did not change anything about it minus just not putting in the onions. My mom made it a couple of years ago for the first time at Thanksgiving so after that I would have to call and find out from her again each year after to find out the recipe again so she finally told me it was from this site. So glad to have the recipe in front of me, can rate it and make it whenever I want. Even husband, who hated green bean casserole liked it.. I was shocked. He's refused to eat these casseroles his whole life until now so thanks!

Made it for "8" servings.  Was generous with the butter and it's great.  Will add more shredded cheese next time.

I'm not a fan of canned green beans so I used fresh haricots vert. They need to be steamed a few minutes prior to assembling the casserole. As far as the flavors go, it is missing a little something. I put a few dashes of soy sauce after I added the sour cream to the mixture but it needs something more. I think the onions need to be caramelized or something. I also needed to add fried onions on top to make it feel like a traditional green bean casserole. I don't miss the canned mushroom soup at all!

Turned out awesome! WAY better than the cream of mushroom soup version!!!!  I only made a few adjustments (personal pref.)   I minced my onion so there would be no large bites.  I added several turns of course ground black pepper, some garlic powder and some cayenne pepper!  Finally, I used the French's Onions in place of the ritz crackers (at my husband's request).  I added half the can of french fried onions IN the casserole and the other half I placed on top of the casserole during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Yum!!  The casserole was loved by all........ no left overs!  :-)

I love this recipe, I make it every year. I recently acquired a gluten free family member, so I started making it with tapioca flour and skipping the crackers for gluten free fried onions. You can't even tell the difference! Everyone loves it, even those not-so-inclined toward green beans!

Mmm good- better than the reg kind. Used 1 1/2 bags of frozen green beans. Followed 1 review: saute onion in butter until tender, use half of flour and half of salt, mix half of the cheese into bean mixture and use other half for topping.

This was a BIG HIT!  I had two of my dinner guests tell me that this was the BEST green bean casserole that they have ever tasted!  I followed the recipe to the "T" EXCEPT that I added Fried Onions on top of the Ritz crackers - just couldn't bare to leave those crispy little buggers out :) Yumm!!!

This recipe is the BOMB!  So much better than the mushroom soup version.  I made a few minor changes such as using frozen cut green beans, cooked the diced onion till translucent, and added half of the Cheddar cheese to the green bean mixture. When the casserole was almost cooked, I added the cracker crumbs, rest of the cheddar, and french fried onion rings till the cheese had melted.  Delicious!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe, Amy.  Definitely a keeper.

Really good, I would maybe mix some of the cheese into the mix instead of putting it all at the top and still only barely cover the top with cheese.  I loved the sour cream instead of the traditional mushroom soup, much better.  I will definatley make this again and just tweak the recipe a bit.  Thanks!

This was a fantastic recipe.  I made if for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I only gave it four stars because I think you should cook the onions in little butter before adding them to the rest of the ingredients.  Otherwise, they are a little too crunchy.  Also, I took several other reviwers' advice and mixed half of the cheese into the green bean mixture and the other half went on top.  This eliminated the thick crust on the top.  All in all, a great recipe.  Even my kids loved it!  We'll be making this next Thanksgiving for sure, although we might not be able to wait that long! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was the best recipe for green bean casserole! I followed the directions on some of the comments and sauteed the onions and reduced the salt and flour by half.  It turned out great.  I will use it again.

I liked this...but next time I'll saute the onions in the butter for just a few minutes and then add them to the beans because raw onion (this is just my opinion) does not make for very good breath.  Otherwise, I will follow the recipe exactly because it was much better than opening a can of soup and dumping it in...

Very good alternative to the traditional green bean casserole.  I reduced the amt of the sour cream that the recipe calls for and I sauteed the onions in the butter before adding the flour.  I also mixed in the onion topping with the butter crackers.

This was okay. I followed the directions, and it definitely was edible - but I think I prefer the "cream of mushroom soup" kind. Seems to have more flavor to me.  Although if you have mushrooms, this is the recipe for you!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, exactly as it is written. It was very easy to make. But the sour cream flavor is fairly dominant, so just make sure your green bean eaters like sour cream ahead of time! We ended up throwing out the leftovers.

This was a great recipe! I used a 13x9 pan and it cut the cooking time down by 10 minutes and it made a nice thick layer of cheese on top.

This is an awesome alternative to the standard green bean casserole we usually have at Thanksgiving. Even our 2-year-old son ate it! Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Good, I added some garlic powder, next time I'd probably add a minced clove of garlic. It was good, it just seemed to be missing something on the seasoning side.

Everyone really liked it. I used fresh green beans, should have kept them crisper before I baked it. Also should have put something crispy on top after.

This was fantastic!! I made two of these casseroles for the 25 people we hosted for Thanksgiving and every bite was gobbled up.  I made one with canned beans and one with fresh beans that I chopped into about 2" pieces and cooked on the stove until slightly soft before adding them to the recipe.  Both were delicious but I personally prefered the fresh beans.  I printed the recipe for several who asked for it and will cook this again at Christmas if not before.  YUMMY!

This is a great recipe that my family has made several times. I've made it with fresh green beans from the garden and also canned beans. Fresh is definietly the way to go.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I used 2 bags of fresh frozen french style green beans.  Cooked them and then added them to this recipe.  Delicious!!  Everyone wants the recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving, and was very nervous about not doing the "traditional" soup recipe for the green beans.  I have to say that this recipe is so much more flavorful than the traditional recipe and I will never go back.  Even my husband who is not big on green beans said it was excellent and had seconds!!  The only change I made was using the fried onions on top instead of the crackers.

I will never make the stuff from a can again! I loved this green bean casserole. The cracker crust was wonderful. At first I was worried about the cheese; it just didn't seem like something that would work in green bean casserole, but I couldn't even tell it was there. It was so much better than the green bean casserole I have been making for years. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

So good! I was a little anxious about not making the traditional green bean casserole with cream of mushroom soup and french onions on top, but I have to say this was delicious.   My husband said it was the best he's ever had. I think I still might prefer the cream of mushroom version slightly more, but this was definitely a nice change.

LOVED this recipe!!  So much better than using mushroom soup!  I doubled the butter and flour using seasoned flour I keep in the pantry for breading when I fry chicken.  My family is picky so I omitted the diced onion but still tasted great because my seasoned flour has onion powder in it. I also used french fried onions rather than crackers because I love them but I think I will try the crackers next time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!  It will take the place of the old one from now on!!

This recipe turned out really good for our Thanksgiving dinner. I left out the fried onions because the family was not a fan of them and it still turned out great. The only thing that I would change would be to use less salt. I think the  cheese I used added more salt than I planned. Good recipe!

Great alternative for people like me who don't care for the mushroom soup version. I've made it a few times and have found that if the onions are diced small enough they will cook and soften in the oven. I also like to use an extra can of beans and only about a cup of cheese. A sprinkling of paprika on top before baking gives the topping a really nice golden color.

MMMMMMMM!   This was so good!  I encorporated some of the other reviewers comments, sauteing the onions in butter to soften and halfing the flower.  I mixed 1/2 of the cheese in with the green beans along with 1/2 a can of French's Fried Onions.  Then I added the rest of the fried onions in with the butter cracker topping.  So good and got rave reviews!  I would have given the final version 5 stars, but as written it's a 4.

Doubled the cheese. I was concerned about the reviews that mentioned the strong sour cream flavor so I threw in about 2 C of cheese into the bean mixture and then another 2 C ontop. Other then that followed the recipe exactly and got nothing but rave reviews. I'm not an onion fan and was worried about them not cooking enough. Chopped them fairly small and it was perfect.

This was just ok. It looked great, but lacked much flavor. If I had it to do over again, I would add more onion or put french fried onions on top instead of the crackers. However, I won't do it over because I'll be going back to the tried-and-true Campbell's soup recipe.

I made this tonight and it was a hit! I modified the recipe slightly though, instead one cup of sour cream I used half sour cream and half ricotta cheese. Also I used regular cut and frozen green beans, and instead of cheddar I use what I had in the fridge a mexican shredded cheese mix.

I was looking for a new green bean casserole recipe for this Thanksgiving.  I made Grandma's GB Casserole and my previous favorite Campbell's recipe to see how they compaired.  Both my mom and I agreed that Grandma's Recipe is the winner!  It was quick and easy and tasted great, this is the green bean casserole that we will have this Thanksgiving!

This is QUITE tasty!  (I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it from its original recipe.)  I served it at a potluck at my church and was pleasantly surprised by the comments!  Everyone RAVED!  It is just as easy as the mushroom soup dish and yet SO MUCH MORE tasty!  Definitely worth a try!  (I didn't use onions because of personal preference.  I mixed half the cheese in with the beans and used french fried onions instead of crackers.)

This is so good. Personally, i stuck with the fried onions on top instead of the ritz crackers, but thats just my preference. Every thing else was PERFECT. This was a big hit at thanksgiving last year and i'm so excited to make it again this year.

The whole family loved this.  Only suggestion is to ease up on the salt.  This is replacing the traditional green been casserole in our family!

I think this dish is perfect AS-IS.  I was so tired of the traditional french fried onions and cream of mushroom soup green bean casserole.  This is such a wonderful alternative and so much better.  It is a must have recipe in my family.  Everyone loves it!

Some of us love mushrooms but everyone typically despises greenbean casserole because it's bland mushyness...this was completely different. On Thanksgiving all I eat are mashed potatoes and now this. Everyone loves it and we make it for Christmas dinner and sometimes Easter now too. It's really excellent and I don't change anything except I use extra fried onions on top!

I make this every year for the holidays. My husband used to turn his nose up at green bean casseroles because of the canned soup flavor... so finding a non-canned soup version was fantastic. -and it tastes better! He is a green bean casserole-loving convert - and I get my holiday food staple. Win win!
I agree with other posters... saute the onion in the butter before adding flour, etc. and cut down a little on cheese - and mix most of it in.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong. I scaled it back to 4 servings but found it very bland. I used frozen green beans and wondered if this had anything to do with it. Even though I like the traditional GBC I don't like using artificial ingredients.

I'll admit I was skeptical.  I was looking for a green bean casserole for Easter that would "kick things up a notch".  This one sounded good, but once I got into it, I got scared of the cheese.  I used 3 pounds of fresh green beans, a whole medium onion, and the whole cup of sour cream.  I also added some fresh garlic that I chopped finely and sauted with the onions.  Instead of the cheese, I used the cheddar cheese flavored French's Onions, mixing half of the container with the green bean mixture prior to baking, and pouring the rest on top to bake.  It was good, but nothing impressive.  Then at dinner, I placed the shredded cheddar cheese next to it.  People melted the cheese over the casserole themselves, and it was amazing!  That being said, don't doubt the recipe!  Add the cheese!  The only good thing about leaving the cheese on the side was that people were able to add it to their own taste level.  I'll definetely make this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving...tried a different recipe for Christmas and my family begged me to make this one again for Easter.  It really is soooooooooooooo good!!  I also cook the onions in the butter until they are a little softer, halved the salt and flour and mixed half the cheese in the casserold, per other reviews.  Delicious!

11/27/14 - go easy on the cheese - like 1 cup.  Add chopped water chestnuts - 1 can.  ....I just made this for our Easter dinner.  I made several changes based on other reviewers comments.  Sauteed the finely chopped onions in a tblsp of butter slowly until they were starting to brown nicely--about 10 min.  Then added a couple of cloves of finely minced garlic simmered for about 5 minutes.  Added in sour cream, sugar 1/2 tsp salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste.  Stirred in fresh steamed green beans, all the cheese and some french fried onions.  Stuffed this into my round casserole dish and topped with more onions.  From the quick taste test I did on the sauce this should be spectacular!  Also making scalloped potatoes and Alton Brown's Ham with bourbon, gingersnap, mustard  and brown sugar crust.  Can't wait!  Pecan Pie V from Allrecipes for dessert.  Mine and hubby's mouth already watering.

Wow. I've never tried a green bean casserole and after making this I will not try another. Yummy. The only thing different was that I used fresh green beans. Very good recipe. This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

This one was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  I used Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar (I didn't try it with cheddar, I just felt it needed a softer cheese).  And I added about 1/4 c of half & half to the sour cream mixture to help make it a little creamier.  It also made it easier to mix.

Very good. I made this for a potluck at work, and we don't have an oven, so I put it in the crockpot on low heat for about 4 hours. I omitted the cracker topping since I couldn't brown it. It was delicious without it. But then I made it for Christmas with it, and it was very good. I prefer this recipe to the traditional one with canned soup and french fried onions...

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone raved! This is now a family favorite. The only thing I changed was using French's Onions on top instead of the rounds.

This dish tastes so good!  I have been wanting to try a green bean casserole for a while now and I am so happy I chose this one! The recipe was so easy to make and I listened to the suggestions of other reviewers and added garlic, pepper, and french fried onions.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was a nice change to the traditional green bean casserole that uses a cream of mushroom or chicken soup. We did use fried onions on top vs. the crackers, since that's what we had on hand, and my husband really likes those fried onions. I did not care for the onions in the casserole itself; the onion taste overpowered the rest of the flavor. Next time, I would cut out the onion all together.

This was a favorite dish at our Christmas dinner.  Fresh beans are a must.  I used grated Gruyere cheese and because I used more beans than the recipe called for, I added some cream to the roux.  Milk would have worked just as well.  Thanks for a delectable recipe.

This recipe was great. I made it for Thanksgiving instead of traditional green bean casserole and was told if I didnt make it again for Christmas my brother and his roommate wouldnt attend dinner here. As other members mentioned doing I also sauteed the onions in the butter until tender then added the flour. I only had 1 and 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar so I used that but doubled the cracker/butter topping and it was completely delicious.

Very good flavor, however, I would either increase the green beans or decrease the sauce. It was too soupy and the sauce, while it had a great flavor, was overpowering. I will definitely make it again, with adjustments!

I liked the taste of this dish except for the canned green beans.   I think fresh green beans taste so much better, and only take a few more minutes.  So I'll make it again but use fresh green beans next time,  the rest of the ingredients give it a good taste though, thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I don't like the "traditional" Green Bean Casserole so I thought I'd try this for Thanksgiving. It is so simple and has loads of flavor. Every guest raved about it! I used canned French-style green beans and followed the recipe exactly. You won't be disappointed!

Really a good-flavored casserole... the flavor of the sour cream can be a little overpowering so I used half the recommended amount.  It's also kind of a hassle to make it the night before, but worth the wait.  It's in my personal cookbook now!

The BEST green bean casserole I've ever had!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was loved by ALL!  I omitted the onions in half of the dish (since I'm not an onion fan) and it was good both ways!  Everyone is now begging me for the recipe and I have been told I am required to bring it for Christmas!  Thanks!

I really liked the recipe and I thought that it had a lot of potential. It was a bit too salty for my taste so I decided to cut out the salt. I also used regular cut canned green beans instead of french cut. I also used 1/2 c. of cream of mushroom soup along w/ 1/2 cup of sour cream. Everyone knows that it can't be a green bean casserole w/out the crispy french onion topping so I also used that instead.

Sooo much better than using goopy cream of mushroom soup.  The only change I made was to use 5 cans french cut green beans.  I'll make this again and again.

My family really enjoyed this although I think next time I'll thin it down w/a little milk. The sauce was very thick but it was very tasty. I did sneak on some of the french's onions on top and that does add something. I also used fresh green beans since I can't stand the canned ones. Basically a really good recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I'm so glad i chose the make this recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  I love green bean casserole, but always felt that the classic Cream of Mushroom soup version was lacking a little something.  After making this recipe, I will never go back to the soup version.  The sour cream and onions added so much more flavor, and the melted cheddar cheese turned out to be delicious (even though I was skeptical about it).  Next time I will try to mix in some fried onions, and/or sprinkle some on top along with the crushed Ritz crackers.  My only revisions to the recipe were that I used a Colby/Monterey Jack blend, and I doubled the amount of cracker/butter topping.  I am addicted!

Absolutely amazing!!!!  The BEST green bean casserole I have ever made.  So good that I now plan on making year round and not just for holidays.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for cream of mushroom soup.  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  My father in law asked to not have the cream of mushroom kind again because he liked this recipe so much.  I used 2 and a half pounds of fresh beans instead of canned.  I cut and steamed them before using in the casserole.  I also used fat free sour cream for those wanting to reduce fat.  I did put half of the cheese in with the sour cream and sprinkled the rest on top.  And I added  crumbled, cooked bacon pieces.  It was so good.  My husband said that he wants it much more than on special holidays.  GREAT RECIPE!

I love the traditional green bean casserole with the onion topping, but this was a great and tasty dish! LOVE the ritz cracker topping. I used fresh green beans and french sliced them and blanched them in hot water for 2 minutes. Will definitely make again!

This was easy and a everyone loved this recipe - it was the first side dish to disappear at Thanksgiving - and much better than that old "off the fried onions" mushroom soup recipe.

I made this as one of my contributions to Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it and I really like the fact that it doesn't include cream of mushroom soup - which I'm not a fan of.

This was very good.  I still prefer to the traditional recipe with cream of mushroom soup, but this is a great substitute when the soup is not available.

I've never liked green bean casserole, but I LOVE this. We hosted Christmas last year and made this, we should have made 4 dishes, it was gone QUICK, and everyone loved it. My hubby thought the sour cream would be tasted in the end, but not at all it made it wonderful!

The is the best Green Bean Casserole I've ever had!!  This Thanksgiving I brought this version and another relative brought a different version...guess which one had leftovers...not mine!!  Everyone loved it, even those who swore they didn't like Green Bean Casserole.  I doubled the batch.  The is definately a new holiday favorite for our family.

I really liked this recipe and so did all my family at thanksgiving. It is so different from the traditional green bean casserole. I followed the advice of momma_s and used "FRESH" steamed green beans instead of canned. Reduced the sour cream to 3/4c. Reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, added black pepper, and 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder with the salt & sugar. Use a large can of french fried onions and mix 1/4-1/2 can into beans, the rest crush with the cracker topping and extra melted butter. Add extra cheese. I made this and also the traditional casserole  made with cream of mushroom soup and no one ate the traditional at all they all devoured this one.

I read through a lot of reviews before trying this out. In the end, I went with these alterations: I used fresh green beans (blanched the night before). I only sprinkled a small amount of cheese on top. I used slightly less sour cream, maybe 3/4 cup. Instead of crackers I used garlic & herb breadcrumbs, and only sprinkled a small amount on top of the casserole. I think the breadcrumbs gave it just a touch of extra flavor. I also sprinkled crunchy fried onions on top about 10 minutes before taking it out of the oven. It was very tasty and I plan to make it again very soon.

I've made this twice and both times it was well loved by the adults. The kids were a bit picky about it. I used fried onions on top instead of crackers.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe! I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving. It was so fast and simple to put together and baked up perfectly. I doubled the recipe to cook for 15 people and everyone loved it. I took some advice from previous reviews and sauteed the onions in butter first and removed them from the pan. I added 3 Tbsp flour (remember, I doubled the recipe) and then 1.5 cups sour cream. I used 6 cans french style green beans and mixed in 2 cups Colby-Jack cheese (I think it melts better than Cheddar) as well as some crushed up fried onions and a few shakes of pepper. I then topped it all with 2 more cups of cheese and the cracker mix - and more crushed up fried onions. This recipe is going in my favorites! Would be great for a potluck too!

The whole family loved this! We are never using another Green Bean Casserole recipe again. The only change I made was to saute the onions a bit longer, and I did add some  French fried onions in addition to the Ritz crackers. Yum!

Yummy! I love this recipe. I still use cream of mushroom soup. But use one more can of green beans. And I use french fried onions instead of crackers. I brought this to our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit. Very easy and perfect for a Thanksgiving table!!!

My sister-in-law is usually the one who brings the green bean casserole but I was a little bored with the standard cream of mushroom soup, fried onion variety so when I ran across this recipe, it sounded good and I just had to try it out for Thanksgiving dinner. 

It was so good, my sister-in-law didn't even care I took her dish over for the year! I loved it and it was a delicious change. 

I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and I would not change a thing.

Awesome!  I was a little worried it wouldn't come out as good without the cream of whatever soup, but it still had a lot of flavor.  I used fresh green beans, steamed them before mixing & I cut back on the cheese, I love cheese but I only used 1 cup, still very good.  I will definitely make this again

The second time was the charm for me with the following modifications: fresh, frozen green beans, blanched til tender- much better than canned! Sauteed the onions. Cut back a bit on the cheese and the sour cream just to make it a bit less goopy. Mixed the cheese in with the beans instead of putting it on top, and I just had to mix in french fried onions, too. Put a few more f.f.o. and a bit of cheese on top when it was nearly done baking, and presto! Perfection!

Idon't care for the "traditional" green bean casserole, so when I was asked to bring one for a family dinner, I did my research.  This recipe popped up, I tried it, and my family has never looked back.  Now, when we go to someone else's home for a holiday and the mushroom soup and fried onion green bean casserole comes out, we take a tiny, polite spoonful, and promise ourselves that sometime in the coming week, we'll have this recipe for dinner to make up for missing it at the holiday feast!

I followed some of the suggestions left by other reviewers - I used 3/4 cup of sour cream, I sauted the onions before adding them to the flour mixture, and I used fresh (steamed) green beans.  I also threw in some shredded swiss cheese.  It was great!  My husband won't go within 20 feet of a mushroom, so finding a green bean casserole without mushrooms was a challenge.  To me, this one is better than the cream of mushroom version - both the sauce and the Ritz cracker topping.  In addition to mushrooms, my husband despises sour cream but he had no idea that the sauce is comprised mostly of it.  He thought that it was just melted swiss cheese.  Next time I am going to try using only swiss and omit the cheddar.  The recipe is great as is, but can certainly handle minor adjustments and still taste good.  Great recipe!

I made this casserole last night for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was wonderful!  The only thing I added was 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup!  Is was a hit.  A sure sign is that there are no leftovers!

I steam cooked fresh cut green beans and thought white sugar read white vinegar.  Whoops! Tasted fine though. I also carmelized the onions.  Overall very yummy!

As written, this would be three stars.  I will make some changes next time.  First, I will omit the crackers/butter all together.  I will replace with French fried onions.  I will cut the sugar down (too sweet!).  Also, I will mix in the cheese instead of layering on top - the cheese layer was too thick!  We used fresh green beans and they were great, though... I would not use canned!  This was such a nice change from the MSG-laden condensed soup recipe!

Super yummy! I used fat free sour cream, sauteed the onions before, just like what others had suggested.. a welcome alternative to cream of mushroom casseroles!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I decided we liked this much better than the traditional casserole with cream of mushroom soup.  The only thing I changed was using light sour cream and reduced fat cheese. I also used French's Fried Onions for the topping instead of the crackers and butter.

My first Thanksgiving in a foreign country that doesn't have Campbell's Cream of Mushroom... thanks for saving me! Wouldn't have been right w/o green bean casserole! I added a tad more onions and more crumbled crackers to the top - they really add a lot. Very easy and yummy!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I'm not  a fan of cooking with condensed soups due to all the unnatural ingredients they contain, so this is a welcome change. I find it somewhat salty as is and cut the salt to 3/4t. Also, for convenience, I don't mix the crackers with butter for the topping and I cut down on the cheese too. Its always a big hit at Thanksgiving.

Loved it! Used sour cream instead of mayo and extra cheese, but that's it. It's even better the next day! Way better than the simple "french fried onion" recipe. I'm making this one for Thanksgiving!

I made this recipe as directed but I scaled it down a little.  It felt like it was missing something (maybe cream cheese?  more onions?) I'm not sure.  It's defintley a good base recipe though!

This was pretty good. I thought it was missing a bit of sweet and saltiness. It had too much of the sour cream taste to it I thought. But with a little bit of extra salt at the table it was good. I would probably add a cream-of mushroom soup or something next time though.

Okay, I think this would have been really good if I hadn't messed it up. I'm not a big fan of green bean casserole, but my boyfriend loves it. Anyway, I can't stand the mushiness (is that a word?!) of canned green beans so I used frozen - but only ran some hot water over them before cooking - just to thaw - and then proceeded making the recipe. WELL, we had very crunchy green bean casserole. ;-) STILL, it was WAAAY better than what they serve me on Thanksgiving with those dried up withered onions on top.

This was not the usual green bean casserole I love at the holidays, to me it lacked the cheesy flavor I look for in green bean casseroles, but having said that, my one year old loved it so I will give it a 4 ****!

With a few modifications this recipe is great for a homemade green bean casserole. When I have the time and all the ingredients, I will definitely make this over the canned soup version.

I used dried minced onion instead of the regular onion, picky eaters in the family. As other reviewers suggested, I decreased the sour cream to 3/4 cup, I also added some garlic powder and garlic salt instead of the regular salt. A key change, use the fried onions...I mix one can in with the casserole and cover the top with more! Great crunch!! Such an authentic flavor...Thanksgiving favorite!

This was good.  I stirred in some french fried onions before baking and then added some on top in the last 10 minutes instead of the crackers.  Delicious!

Excellent.  Took this to a dinner at the in-laws and everyone loved it. I saute the onions in the butter, then add flour and let it cook for a few minutes, then add other ingredients and a bit of milk before sour cream.  Also use fresh green beans steamed for a couple minutes.

I was looking for something more homemeade than the typical green bean casserole made with a can of soup. After reading the rave reviews, I gave this a try and everyone loved it - my mother-in-law even asked for the recipe. I initially made it for Easter, but then a few weeks later I halved the recipe and made it for a regular weeknight dinner. I just love ot!

I made this recipe as is and I must say that it was a little too salty and the green beans were too mushy. When I make this again I would reduce the salt and use frozen green beans instead of canned.

Delicious!  Next time, I will not use as much sour cream though, a cup was a little too much for our taste.

I made this casserole on Easter 2008 with ham and sweetpotatos.  It was a great tasting recipe.  I liked it better than the ones using mushroom soup.  It has more of a green bean taste. Thank you for the recipe.

I think this is a really good recipe.  I made it as directed, except I cooked the onions in the butter before adding the flour.  I ended up using a little milk to thin it out a tad and used probably 1 1/2 cups cheese.  And definitely more crackers, 1/2 cup was not enough to cover the top.  It was well received by everyone and tasty....but I honestly think I prefer the traditional recipe with cream of mushroom and fried onions.  Good variation, though!

very, very good!  I sauteed the onion in the butter and also layered the cheese in with the beans, in addition to putting it on top.  I think this adds to the presentation and overall flavor.  I don't like canned green beans very much so I took the suggestion of others and used steamed, fresh green beans.  I loved this change and it made a delish veggie side for my family's Easter dinner!  I will make this again, perhaps with less sour cream next time and maybe some mushrooms sauteed in the butter with the onion.

I just made this for Easter dinner.  We liked it, but I think the cream of mushroom recipe beats this one.  The sour cream adds kind of a sharp/tangy flavor.  I used a combo of fresh and canned beans (what I had on hand) and topped with fried onions, because I like them.  It was pretty good, but I think I'll stick with the classic recipe.

A great side dish for holidays or special dinners! I've made this countless times, I love green beans but have never cared for the taste of the cream soup in the more common casserole recipe. This may be more work, but it just tastes so much better to me.

Wonderful! Was a big hit at the dinner I brought it to - there was nothing left. Loved the sour cream taste. I used fresh green beans(a must in my opinion)!

This was the best green bean casserole I've ever tasted. Took it to a family dinner and it was a huge hit. Took other users' advice and cooked the onion with the butter and reduced the flour by half. I found there wasn't enough crumbs/butter mix to top a 9x13 pan, so I just doubled that to cover the top nicely. Worked great! Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner and I got mixed reviews.  I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was much better than the cream of mushroom variety.  I took advice from others and sauteed the onons first, but I added chopped canned muchrooms to the pan also.  I also used less flour and added the sour cream by taste.  I mixed half of the cheese in too.  I think next time I will use fresh or frozen green beans.  Some really enjoyed it.

This green bean casserole was SO much better than the original with cream of mushroom soup.  It is much more creamy and has so much more taste to it.  Don't be fooled by the number of crackers, it is definitely enough.  In order to get a little of the onion flavor I salted the crackers with onion salt before crumbling them and topping the casserole. 

I will never make the original recipe again!

I fixed this for Thanksgiving and I liked it but I don't think anyone else was really into it.  They said they preferred the Campbell's soup recipe.  Go figure!!  I think it was really tasty though, especially as leftovers.

I made this for Christmas Dinner and it was a big, big hit. I did add a half a can of french fried onion to the mixture but that was because I LOVE them, not because I doubted the recipe. 
This was rich and delicious, perfect for a cold winter night.
I will make it again, for sure!

I liked this especially since it doesn't have the cream soup in it.  I may opt for less cheddar cheese next time since I think it overpowered the green beans slightly.

I was looking for something to tweak the same-old green bean casserole recipe and this was it. No leftovers of this on Thanksgiving.

The first time I made this dish I used frozen green beans.... Don't use them unless you like your green beans crisy in the dish :) I made it a second time and the changes I made was I did sautee the onions, used canned green beans (as suggested)and instead of using ritz crackers I used the standard french onions which I liked better. It was such a good dish! Everyone love it! I will make it again.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving ever.  My step-dad is super picky and hates mushrooms.  So I needed something without them.  And I hate using canned soups in recipes, makes me feel like I'm cheating. So this one was wonderful.  I did double the cracker topping.  And I used steamed greenbeans that I had steamed the night before and stored in the fridge.  Everyone loved it, and with my family that is saying something.

The absolute, unparalled BEST green bean casserole anywhere! I've made this recipe for three years now and have given it out at least 20 times to people. Sorry about the delay in rating it. :) The only change I ever make is to use French's Onions instead of the crackers...because I always forget to buy the darn crackers. But this is amazing with the fried onions!!

I love this green bean casserole, and I normally don't care for it.  The cracker topping and the sour cream make it a little different.

A very yummy green bean casserole.  I would prefer the sauce to be a bit creamier, saucier, and less thick.  The next time that I make this, I'll probably decrease the sour cream a little and add some milk.

Due to a Christmas Eve crisis, I had to use the ingredients I had on hand. Therefore, I substituted the fresh chopped onions for French's fried onions and also used the fried onions for the topping instead of crumbled Ritz. I also used only half the shredded cheese as we were also having homemade mac and cheese for Christmas lunch. Everyone seemed to like this version of green bean casserole better than the traditional condensed soup recipe. I may, however, omit the cheese altogether next time, as the sour cream makes the dish rich and creamy enough.

This was very good I did though split the sour cream that was called for with half sour cream and half cream of mushroom soup so that it would still have a hint of that cream of mushroom taste.  I also added the french fried onions on top instead of the crackers (just our family's personal preference).  Overall this was very easy and very good.  I did also only bake it in the oven for 15min, and it was just as good.

Brought this for the vegtable at Christmas dinner and thought it was the best dish on the table. Nothing left for anyone to bring home. Will cut back on the sour cream next time though. Was a bit to "white" and overshadowed the green beans but still tasted great!

This is absolutely the best green bean casserole I have ever had.  Instead of the crackers I use the fried onions in a can for the topping.  My family raves over how wonderful the flavor is.  It is always the first to go at our holiday gatherings. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.

Have made this recipe twice now and everyone has absolutely loved it.  So many of our friends have called to get the recipe, so I would say it's a success.  I too sauted the onion in the butter before adding the flour.  I also topped with the french's onions.  Amazing!

I loved this dish, I made it for Christmas dinner. Even though I made some modifications, I'm sure it would be 5* just the way it is.  My family likes the mushroom soup flavor, so as I was cooking the onion (only used 1/2), I added about 2 cups of mushrooms that I chopped finely in my food processor.  I cooked those down and the mushrooms made a nice stock that added tons of flavor.  I proceeded to add the sour cream and green beans, then I stirred in about 1 cup cheese and topped with 2 cans of fried onions and heated it in my slow cooker for a couple of hours.  There was no mess to clean up after supper except for the turkey and no rush to have all the dishes ready at once!  Everyone raved about it and said they could NEVER eat the canned soup casserole again.  Thank you!

This is better than the traditional French onion recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I will use more crackers and less cheese.  

I also think I might try a few other casseroles on this site and on foodnetwork.com before I settle on this one as "the one."  It's pretty good but doesn't immediately replace what we've always done.

Pretty darn good! Altho I made a couple additions to it, I added french fried onions as well as the crackers for the topping, I sauteed the onions for about 5 minutes in the butter to soften them, then added the flour. I also added about 2 table spoons of dijon mustard and a sprinkle of onion powder... came out great! will make every holiday for sure!

Excellent recipe...Made this and it was gone in a flash. I would only use 1/2 cup of sour cream because it can be quite overpowering and i also used French Fried Onions instead of Breadcrumbs. Im giving it 4 stars only because the recipe calls for too much sour cream..Other then that iit is perfect and much better then the traditional Cream of Mushroom Casserole..

I made this for Christmas eve dinner and used some of the posted tips.  I used steam fresh green beans and instead of adding cheese on top, I added a handful to the sour cream mix. I also added garlic powder, seasoning salt, and a splash of milk to thin out the sauce mix a little bit.  After it was cooked I added a 3/4 of a can of fried onions in place of Ritz crackers to the top and returned the dish to the oven until the onions were browned.  It was wonderful!  I love the traditional green bean casserole but this was even better.  Next time I would add some diced mushrooms to the mix.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was good.  First time I ever made green bean casserole as it is not a 'norm' dish for most southern african americans.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Yummy!

Very good!  I'd NEVER had GBC before I made this for a potluck the other night and it was all gone after most everyone had seconds.  Mods included: mixed 3/4c. of the cheese in with the bean mixture before moving to casserole dish, used only 3/4c. cheese on top, and added about 1c. of french fried onions to top instead of butter/cracker combo.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not a fan of traditional green bean casseroles but this was pretty good.  I used fresh and lightly steamed green beans and brought it for Thanksgiving.  Everyone enjoyed this dish.  Thanks!

This dish is as wonderful as all of the previous reviewers have concluded.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter at Thanksgiving this year; my only modification was to add french fried onions to the topping.  I also used fresh green beans as previous reviewers have suggested.  Simply great.  Beats the standard mushroom soup green bean casserole variety.  This will became a staple side dish at both Thanksgiving and Christmas in the years to come.

Pretty good recipe, but not so great, that I wouldn't do the standard mushroom soup version again. I loved the cheddar cheese on top.

Wonderful dish. I did add the fried onion in the dish and on top. I also added cheese as some ppl suggested. If you want to use fresh green beans you need to steam them till they are soft otherwise they are too hard.

I made this for the first time this past Thanksgiving and I love this recipe! I am normally not a fan of green bean casserole but this was wonderful. I was asked for the recipe by almost everyone. It got four stars because none of the children liked it, but the adults loved it.  

I mixed in the cheese like others suggested. Other than that I followed the recipe.

I will make this again and again.

Was worried about making this for Thanksgiving so I waited until after to make it.  Now I wish I would have made it on Thanksgiving.  It was really good! Next time I may try without the cheese though.

I don't know if I just rushed the recipe, but the end result was just too runny.  I'm a fan of the French's French Fried Onions recipe, but I wanted to try something new.   Too much cheese for my taste.

I usually love green beans, so I don't know what exactly was amiss.  I was not fond of the cracker/cheese topping, either.  My mom thought it was okay.  Maybe I will try a more classic variant of this.

I made this for our Thanksgiving, and it was absolutely delicious! I took the advice of a few others and satueed the onions to soften them, and I added extra of the cracker topping. We actually ended up with two green bean casserole dishes (my sister brought one), the other being the "classic" recipe. By the end of the meal, the "Grandma's Green Bean Casserole" was gone, and there was plenty left of the other one -- and I was asked to remake it for Xmas. It is divine!

I thought this recipe was OK, but I really like the standard green bean casserole. My mother in law dislikes the normal green bean casserole and hates cream of mushroom soup, she LOVED this casserole. After tasting this casserole she has vowed never to cook the other one again.

I made this for my expat Thanksgiving here in Florence, Italy. It was a HIT! There was enough to feed 11 Italians (along with the rest of the feast) and it was the only side dish that didn't remain as leftovers. I had to search the entire city to find sour cream, Ritz crackers and Cheddar cheese, but I did it (good for future reference!) and it was WELL worth it!! Nice recipe, grandma!

Hats of to the chef. I have never really cared for green bean casserole, but I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and I was AWESOME. I removed about 2tbsp of sour cream out of the suggested 1cup. I added a lot more cheese and a little extra crackers on top. I also cooked for an addition 10 minutes. Excellent recipe, its a keeper.

This is the best Green Bean Casserole ever.  I followed the recipe and it came out delicious.  For years I've always baked the standard Green Bean Casserole recipe on the back of the fried onion container and this was a nice change.

This dish is AMAZING!  I thought green bean casserole was a dish we all make but nobody really likes.  My fiance requested the boring recipe so I found this one instead.  Then my dad heard about it and requested I bring it to dinner.  I brought it and wow.  They all went crazy for it. My dad and my brother girlfriend were fighting for the left overs.  It's that good.  I did use a little more cheese and the traditonal fried onions.  Other wise PERFECT.  Thanks.

I always make the traditional green bean casserole for everyone every Thanksgiving.  I rarely eat it myself because I find it bland and boring.  This knocked my socks off!  Everyone loved it, and I was happy to have the leftovers this year!  I have finally finished it off, and it was wonderful.  I will make this every year, and any time I have a potluck or occasion to go to that calls for this delicious spin on an old favorite!  AWESOME!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner. I ended up cooking it a few minutes too long and the cheese ended up being a bit difficult to cut through. I think there was too much cheese in this recipe. Next time I will use less cheese and mix it into the green beans! Other than that it was delicious!

WOW! I have never made this without needing cream of something soup, and this was DELICIOUS!! It was the first thing to go at Thanksgiving, I wish I had made a LOT more. It's the only thing anyone is talking about afterwards, next to the deep fried turkey. Only thing I changed was the topping, I put fried blackpepper and garlic onions on top. I will never make this any other way, thank you for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but even after several changes, the sour cream flavor still really stands out. I do, however, prefer it to the traditional green bean casserole, and my boyfriend LOVED it. I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup, added fried onions to the green beans, and instead of putting the cheese on top, I mixed it in with the sour cream/flour/butter mixture with a little bit of milk until it was smooth and creamy, and added it to the beans. I also added fried onions to the cracker topping.

Excellent flavors!  I added a can of mushrooms (chopped) and cheese to the mix.  I topped with a mixture of the crackers and fried onions to please my husband.  A great side dish for Thanksgiving.

We didn't care for this as much as we thought we would.  It might be - as other reviewers said "don't use canned beans" and I did.  I will make again using frozen or fresh.  Gave it a four rating because it is probably my fault that it didn't turn out as expected.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was marvelous.  I changed one minor thing, I used fresh green beans, which I steamed for about 10 minutes prior to baking, and it was fabulous.  I used light sour cream and lower fat cheese, and it still was a huge hit.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This was the first thing completely gone at Thanksgiving.  I fed a family of Mexicans that has never had green bean casserole before and they all loved it.  I can't wait to make it again for dinner one night.  I used fried onion topping instead of crackers and I shredded 16 oz of cheese which was more than the recipe called for.  Delicioso!

Made this for thanksgiving for my family who are all excellent cooks. For a table of 15 it obviously went pretty fast and got great reviews. Only thing I would change is cutting back on the sour cream and using frozen green beans. I dont cook with canned foods much and try to use fresh as much as possible or frozen, but was in a hurry this time. All in all it was good!

Not terribly impressed.  But proabably because I used canned green beans as per recipe.  Next time I will use a bag of frozen, thawed beans.  Tasted very tinny to me.  Personal preference though.  We NEVER use canned beans.  Other than the tin taste, it was good.

I've had green bean casserole before and each time I visited a friend's house and they served it or tried a recipe, I always left very disappointed, but after browsing allrecipes and reading the reviews of this recipe I decided I would try it and IT IS SUPERB!!!!!! Absolutely a great recipe that will definitely become a staple in our home. Thanks to Amy B. for submitting it.

I tested this recipe on our Thanksgiving table.  It was a very tasty alternative to the mushroom soup variety.  I followed the recipe except I only used 2 cans of French cut green beans.  I'm glad I didn't use more or the casserole would have been too dry, as we like the "sauce" of the dish.  I will make this again, though no one actually made rave comments.

This would have been way better if the recipe called for fresh or frozen green beans. It had a lot of potential, but the taste of canned green beans was so prevalent. My suggestion is to substitute the canned beans for fresh or frozen. The sauce and topping was, however, very yummy.

Made this yesterday for Turkey day- It was fabulous!  Only made a few changes- halved the salt, and cooked the onions in bacon grease hoping to pull in some bacon flavor.  Everyone loved it!  Will be making it again next year.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was so excited when I read this recipe.  It seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.  I only used half the amount of cheese because after all that sour cream, I wanted to at least be able to see the green beans.  In the future, I will definitely lessen the amount of sour cream and continue to half the amount of cheese or I may just add an extra can of green beans.  But yes, the flavor was outstanding, so much better than standard cream of mushroom recipes.

Made it for Thanksgiving.  Guests thought it was good enough to eat (but not great). No one in my family (husband, boys 6,9) would eat it.  Sour cream flavor was too strong and IMO cheese just didn't go well with grean beans.  I took advice of others and mixed about half of the cheese in the beans. Maybe it wasn't as good because I used minced onions instead (boys won't even try food where they can see onions).

Loved this recipe!  The only thing I'd change next time is to add the crackers right before serving.  I also didn't have the room in the oven, so I put it in the crockpot on low for 2 hours.  It was perfect!

Yummy!  I made this for Thanksgiving last night for about 20 people.  They all loved it.  Before I could even try it someone hollered from down the table, "Who made the green bean casserole?  It's so good!" I made 2 large casseroles and I'm sorry (and glad) to say, there was none left for me to take home!

I just made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  As I was cooking the sauce, the flour made it a little too thick and I ended up adding a little more sour cream to compensate. I added some crumbled bacon for more flavor.  I also sauteed the onion along with some fresh mushrooms.  It was a much better addition to our table than the mushroom soup variety.  Next time I will mix more of the cheese into the beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit, with some changes to make it a lighter version. I left out the cheese, as well as all of that butter and cracker mess that I'm sure is delicious, but just not necessary. Instead, I used one SMALL can of the french fried onions (500 calories in the small can alone), and it was delicious! If you already like green beans, you really don't need to go out of your way to dress them up.

While cooking this:  the flavor was delicious.  But, after I cooked it, it lost its creaminess???  What'd I do wrong?  It had nice flavor but had chunks of white flavorily glob?  I finely shredded the onions so that my kiddos wouldnt know they were in there!  I also added french fried onions, and omitted the cheese and crackers to make it "look" like the traditional recipe.  Good flavor, but disappointed in the final texture

A nice alternative to the Durkee green been casserole!

Give it a try. I bet it'll be a hit.

This was so good! It is much better than the mushroom soup version. The only thing I would change (or add) is mixing French Onions in with the crackers.

I made almost exactly per the recipe.  I held all the onions in the mixture and topped with the traditional French's crunchy onions since many in my family can't tolerate onions but can pick off the top if they didn't want it. It bakes as a cheesy casserole so it does not look like the picture at all.  I brought it to my very picky in-laws for Thanksgiving - trusting the high grades from so many reviewers.  At first most took a token little bit (one even asked, "where's the green bean casserole?" - wondering where the ole mushroom soup recipe was I'm sure).  Every single man took seconds and one said, "you can always add cheese to everything I eat" - the ritz crackers topping is delicious.  The whole things was great - I scaled to 16 servings and it scaled perfectly - and there was maybe one serving left which says a LOT considering how many Thanksgiving side dishes there are.

I doubled the recipe (with some variations) and fixed this for office parties.  Of all the side dishes, this was the only one completely finished!  Variations--sauted the onions first, halved the salt, & layered the cheese.

I am not sure why anyone would use canned green beans. They are grey and mushy. So I used fresh ones! YUM. This was very good! I will use this recipe again and again.

This is a solid recipe in that it cooks well and the flavors work well together, so I gave it four stars.  However, it is a little too sour for my family's taste, so I'll go back to a traditional recipe.

This was an excellent dish, although, my cheese never melted correctly. I had to remove the cheese after it was cooked and top with thin slices of Velveeta cheese and it turned out great. Personally, I am so anxious about the new recipe since I never eat green bean casserole because of the mushroom soup. This was incredible! 

Thanks, Gabrielle

I made this to bring for an Easter dinner at a friends and it was a huge hit! I used extra french onions and no crackers just because I love french onions. I also added some extra sourcream and used fresh greenbeans as per previous reviewers. It was very delicious!

Made this for Easter and while no one raved, everyone liked it.  I love sour cream, so it was great to me!  Only change was I used 2 cans of beans since there were only 3 of us and scaled everything else proportionately.  I'll probably make this again since it was so easy and a little different from the norm.

I thought this was a nice change up from the normal green bean casserole, very tastey and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The sour cream really did add a zesty kick to it.

I agree that this is better than the cream of mushroom soup version, but we really didn't like it that much.  Followed the recipe exactly - didn't make any of the recommended changes or additions.  It's just OKJ - won't make again.

This was fabulous!!  I used fresh greenbeans I had in the freezer from the summer.  I left off the cracker crumb topping due to a family members allergies.  The only other thing I did differently was when I chopped the onion I also chopped one small clove of garlic for a little additional flavor.  I didn't measure the sour cream... Just 'eyeballed' it since I guessed on the amount of greenbeans as well.  I will be making this again and again!!!

This was a great alternative to the usual "green bean" casserole.  I made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas and got compliments both times.  I did add the fried onions on top to keep with the traditional look.  This will be my new traditional dish to serve at holiday meals.

Nice change for green bean casserole.  I did not use the butter or onions. I started with stirring the sour cream, salt, & sugar together.  Then I added the green beans, cheese on top & cracker crumbs with spray on margarine.

I tried this recipe for our Christmas dinner.  It's so easy to prepare and plus it was SOOO delicious.  It's absolutely better than Campbell's traditional green bean recipe.  By the way, I forgot to add the sugar but it still turned out excellent.  Everybody loved it and my mother-in-law even asked for the recipe and she said it's the best she ever had.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my favorite recipes book.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it!  They don't want me to ever go back to the other green been casserole recipe.  I'll be making it again for Christmas dinner.  I also used fried onions instead of crackers.

I tried this with a twist; put a package of scalloped potatoes on the bottom layer, and it worked out great; got so many compliments on it when we took it to the Thanksgiving dinner this year!

Yummy, everyone ate this dish up.  They liked the twist.  We are cheese lovers, so I doubled the amount of cheese.  A must do for the holidays.

This was the best green bean casserole ever!  I followed the directions exactly and served it with Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  There was only 1/2 cup left and that was even eaten before the night was out!  Even the kids loved it.  Actually, I am serving it again tonight with baked chicken.  FIVE STARS!!!

Just okay.  Bummer.  Hubby was very disappointed, as he really loves & looks forward to the green bean casserole.  I shouldn't have messed with the "normal" recipe using cream of mushroom soup and french fried onions.

A Thanksgiving hit and easy to make! I was so happy to find a green bean casserole NOT made with the traditional cream of mushroom soup. The sour cream makes all the difference - probably next time I might add a touch more. The topping is delicious and cooks beautifully. Overall, such a good recipe it's worth making it year-round! The perfect recipe for a pot-luck dinner!

Very good and easy to make. A very good variation from the traditional.  I would use the italian cut beans or regular cut next time because the french cut are too delicate and get to mushed up in the mixing.  I also used fat free and cut out the butter on the top to reduce the fat and calories...it was still very good and rich tasting.

Thsi is now my go-to green bean casserole! This turned out fabulous.  I loved the flavor of the sauce.  I took this to a potluck dinner where our family usually has the traditional casserole.  They absoultely raved about it.  I got so many complements that the sauce was so much flavorful than the usual mushroom soup. I made put everything together the night before, except for the crackers.  And then baked it the next day.  It turned out absolutelty perfect!

This didn't turn out very good for me- the sour cream was clumpy and it doesn't reheat well, either.  I did like the cheddar cheese- but I think I'll stick to the traditional green bean casserole with cream of mushroom soup.

This recipe is fantastic! I've been looking for a recipe without the canned and processed ingredients that tasted as good as the original, and this was definitely it! I made a couple of modifications - I used diced leeks instead of the onion for a stronger flavor, frozen string beans, and used whole wheat breadcrumbs instead of the crackers, and it was great. Even my string bean hating husband loved it!

Ilove this recipe, although my family doesn't quite share my enthusiasm. I agree that it's better than the standard french-fried onion version. The sour cream and cheese make a tasty combination. I've taken this to potlucks and to friends; new baby, meals during illnesses, etc., and have always gotten compliments.

A family favorite for years! We often use the French's fried onions for the topping and also add pepper to the mixture.

I am a green bean casserole lover, but I did not really care for this casserole. My guests liked this, but something just seemed a little off in the taste to me. It had this weird almost nutty flavor to me.  It was a good basic casserole, but probably not one I would make again.

This is the best green bean casserole ever!  I always get rave reviews and I haven't changed a thing in the recipe.  I just buy the big can of green beens instead of the 3 smaller cans.

We loved it! Even my picky brother!
The only changes I made, I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup instead of sour cream.
I will be making this one a lot!

Made this for a buffet supper and not all of it was eaten.  Perhaps if I had used fresh beans it would have been better.  It was good - but it still is a canned green bean casserole.  I used a little less sour cream as advised and the craker topping was good.  I may still try it again because it was super easy to make and certainly inexpensive.

This recipe was really good.  My family enjoyed it. We substituted shredded colby/jack cheese instead of cheddar and used only two cans of French style green beans.  The only thing I felt it needed was more salt and pepper. Great recipe when you don't have canned soup!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving. We were all pleasantly surprised about how good it turned out.  The round crackers gave a new and delicious twist to regular topping.  This casserole was extremely easy and quick to fix, but most of all, it was extremely good.  I will definetely make it again!

This is the best green bean casserole I (and everyone at Thanksgiving dinner yesterday) have ever tasted. I personally do not like mushrooms, although, I did put the french fried onions on top instead of the buttery crackers. yum :) Thanks so much for this recipe.

WOW!!! What a fantastic recipe this is. I've never had the mushroom soup green bean casserole, but if you have and you're tired of it, THIS is the one you want to fix. Every time I have it, it seems to steal the show. The ingredients work together and make this a tangy treat. Even if you don't really care for green beans, this recipe will change your mind as the predominant flavor is sour cream. Thank you for this excellent and popular recipe.

Made this exactly to the recipe except upping it for 15 people. Turned out much better than the can o' soup kind and family really liked it. Not much left! Very easy to make and tasty too.

Very good, made to a T and the family loved it.  I thought it was a tad rich, but I guess that's what makes this so good.  The sour cream really adds a little zing.  I used sharp cheddar on top which may have made this a little more rich as well.  Made this with the Butter Chicken and Ceasar Salad both from this site and the whole meal was a great success.
Thanks Amy.

Excellent!!  The cracker topping was so crunchy and delicious and the cheese added the perfect flavor!!  So much better than the soup mix casserole.  My boyfriend loved it so much he ate half the casserole!!  Perfect side dish for turkey or meatloaf.

My family LOVES this recipe -- my only complaint would be that the servings are way off -- I can't imagine the original recipe serving 10 people!  Or maybe my family just eats alot... :)  Also, I replaced the crackers/butter with fried onions b/c they are crispier.

This is my second time making this.  If you cut the sour cream back some, this recipe is great.  My step-dad almost ate the ENTIRE casserole dish!  Since I was short on time, I didn't use onions, but instead mixed in the fried onions into the green beans mixture.  LOVED IT!

I am not really a big fan of green bean casseroles in general so I am no expert but I think this one is certainly better than the traditional stand-by.  My guests seemed to really enjoy it and the bowl was emptied.  Next time a gb casserole is requested, I will certainly bring this one!  Thanks!

I can't see how people would say this was bland. It was SO good and flavorful. I ate ALL of the leftovers myself! :)

It's a good recipe. However, it doesn't make anywhere near the advertised 10 servings. Doubled, it fit perfectly into a 2.5 Qt. casserole dish - yielding perhaps 5 to 6 servings.

This was good but not as good as I was hoping for after seeing the overall rating. I should have made this before hand instead of trying a new recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. I think everyone preffered the *old stand-by* with cream of mushroom soup. This would work in a pinch with some adjustment if you have no COM soup but I think I will stick with my old faithful recipe from now on. As others mentioned it was very *tangy*.

I had to make so many changes to this recipe to make it great, and I cannot give it five stars.  Infact, after reading most of the "most helpful" reviews, I practically had a new recipe.  I tried it twice (once the original way, and once with changes), so I will submit the newly created recipe... wait for it...

I've made this recipe for the past 3 thanksgivings.  Everyone has ALWAYS loved them and requested the recipe, but I've never liked them...at all.  My family requested this dish again this year but I decided to take another reviewers advise and make them with fresh steamed green beans.  OMG THAT IS THE KEY!!!  They were incredible!  I actually had 3 servings and brought some more home with me.  So my changes were:  fresh steamed green beans, extra onions, extra garlic, extra cheese, complete seasoning and I used the French onions, not the buttery crackers.  Great recipe!

A nice change from the usual mushroom/green bean casserole. I used frozen green beans instead of the canned beans. Frozen beans are a more appetizing looking green in the casserole.

This is the BEST RECEIPE.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone was eatting it up.  Everyone wanted the receipe.  They were amazed that there was no soup involved.  I double and a half this recipe.  I used Ritz Garlic and Butter crackers for the top which was great.  I also used fat free sour cream and half fat free shredded cheese and half regular since I wanted to make a lighter version and no one noticed.  I told everyone that it was made with fat free after they ohhh and ahhh over it.

Absolutely amazing!!! I followed the recipe pretty much word for word, and it turned out great!! I doubled it, and used Mexican shredded cheese. I also mixed about a half of a cup of the cheese into the bean mixture. The cheese and crackers on top combined for an amazing topping! Very rich!! I will never make the standard variety casserole again! :)

I made this last year for Thanksgiving in a crockpot since my oven was taken up with the turkey. I just turned the crock pot on high and everything cooked fine. Followed the ingredients exactly and family members were impressed. The cheese didn't brown but that was ok. 

Will be making again this year. YUM!

This was really good!  I didn't change a thing.  I thought it would be a little soupy with the sour cream, but it was very thick and rich.  My family loved it, even my picky father!

I am not a fan of "normal" greenbean casserole - even if I was hungry I would not eat it. This on the other hand is SUPERB!!!  Every time I make it I get asked for the recipe!  I use the regular cut green beans (just my preference) and fat free sour cream & low fat cheese and it still turns out great!

This was a big hit at Easter.  There were leftovers of everything else but this.  It was liked even by those that don't enjoy the usual green bean casserole.

This truly is much better than the standard green bean casserole.  My children actually ate this!  I used fat-free sour cream and only 1 cup of shredded cheddar.  The butter/cracker topping was just right too.

Wonderful, easy casserole, which rivals the original.  I like this one better because I don't like mushrooms. My son loved it and he hates the other version. Made this twice, once for a church dinner. It went over well. Definitely great for company and kids!

Wow, this was great. I almost didnt make it because so many reviews said it was just like the can mushroom soup and fried onion dish....nope. I used fat free sour cream and only half the cheese also just crushed reduced fat crackers without additional butter on top. I will make this again.

This is the best green bean casserole I have ever tasted.  I make it all the time and get so many compliments.  However, I do add extra cheese in the green bean mixture and more crackers on top.  It gives it just a little something extra.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I used fat-free sour cream and Durkee fried onions on top.  I was a little turned off because you could definitely tell that canned beans were used, but I love the sauce--I will make it again but will experiement with fresh or frozen green beans.

Great switch from the kind with mushroom soup. I'm not big on mushroom soup and have never really enjoyed Green Bean Casserole. This year was the first year I really enjoyed it. My family loved it too. Instead of the crackers, I used the french fried onions though. Great!

My fiance is used to his mom's and grandma's recipe for this dish and it includes cream of mushroom soup (he hates mushrooms) he doesn't love it.  I made this-left out the onions-and he LOVES it.  He will make any excuse for me to cook this dish.  He's told his fam that this will be my dish to bring for Thanksgiving so they don't have to bother making theirs. Definately  a recipe to keep.

I made this recipe over the weekend for friends and everyone seemed to liked it. But like some of the other reviewers, I, too, found the sour cream taste to be overpowering. (i liked it better the next day.) I will also reduce the flour. As is, it came out with the consistency of Play-do when mixed with the butter. But I think this is a great dish to make for a potluck as most people will enjoy it. This is a definite "comfort food" dish. I'm going to try it again with fresh, steamed green beans and as others suggested with a tsp. of garlic powder.

This is a nice alternative to the traditional soup casserole - lighter with a homemade taste. Enjoy everyone! Thanks Amy...

I made this for our office potluck instead of the more traditional version and everyone loved it!  I had many requests for the recipe and people who typically don't like green bean casserole like it.

A fantastic, simple, green bean casserole recipe.  I tried it for the first time when we had a party recently and it went down very well indeed.

Wow!  This was great.  I expected something like the traditional green bean casserole.  However, this was far better.  I will never make the other one (with canned fried onion rings) again.

I liked this greenbean casserole. And so did my whole family.  I will add it to my collection.  I still like the mushroom soup casserole too.   Maybe I will do one for Thanksgiving and the other for Christmas! I will make this again.

absolutely fabulous--have recommended it to many others.  Even my fussy kids scarfed it down and were looking for seconds!  I wouldn't change a thing!  We're having a potluck at work and will share the recipe again.

My husband and i absolutly loved this recipe, we decided that we will make it at all family functions from now on. My 12 yr old daughter did not like this, she likes sour cream, green beans and cheese so we decided that she is just being picky and that we will not force her to eat it because we get more that way :) Thank you Amy

I thought this was an Ok recipe.  The taste of the sourcream was overpowering, and outside of the sourcream taste, there was not much more taste to this dish.

I gave this 4 stars because I would have given it 3, but my son says it deserves 5 stars.  So, like everything else, it's just a matter of taste.  I thought it was good, but not outstanding.  He loved it.  Guess you'll have to try it for yourself!

This was wonderful!  Much better than the standard though I did top it with the fried onions rather than the crackers.  My husband and his family loved this and there were virtually no leftovers!  Permanant family favorite!

This recipe is great! I made it for Thanksgiving and my family devoured it. I followed a few suggestions and mixed in half of the cheese. I also added a tsp. of garlic powder. This casserole is going to be a new holiday tradition.

This is a fabulous recipe.  In fact, I've made it twice in two weeks!  I did follow a previous suggestion and stirred half of the cheese into the green bean mixture.  I also cut the salt in half which works better for my family's taste.

I am not a green bean fan and had never tried the standard muchroom soup version because I don't like mushrooms either.  My husband likes green bean casserole and I wanted my 3 year old daughter to try it as well.  All 3 of us loved this casserole (me...the green bean hater included).  It was simple to make and wasn't overpowering in flavor.  Thumbs up from all of us!!!  My daughter loves sour cream so that was an added bonus for her.

this was pretty good. although i used frozen green beans. i think it'd have been better with the canned like it called for. probably french style. i would add more cheese next time and salt.

I took this dish to my husband's family's Christmas dinner and it was a big hit.  I didn't even try it first but it was great.  Definately a keeper!

My husband and daughter thought it was good - but, not as good as traditional green bean casserole - I personally thought it was every bit as good as the traditional one.  Its a keeper

These were my favorite part of Christmas dinner.  So much better than the standard fried onion recipe.  I didn't change a thing and will make these again soon.
