This soup is GREAT but it definitely makes way more than 5 servings!!!! I fed a family of five and still had enough to fill a big bowl for the refrigerator!

Easy Tasty Chicken Tortilla Soup: "What's missing in here? It is called 'Tortilla Soup', but no tortillas?" Had to chuckle at preparing this recipe that there were no tortillas (corn, flour, chip, or otherwise) in the ingredient list, so lazy me just tossed some chips on at the end. I've just noticed too that I completely missed the cream of chicken soup, for which I feel bad for even reviewing this, b/c I think w/, or w/o it, the soup's flavor and texture would change quite a bit. (IMHO, I'm glad I forgot it.) Random rant - I dislike recipes w/o nice even serving sizes that I can calculate down by half. What's w/ the 5? So I eyeballed the ingredient list and scaled it to the best of my poor, mathematically-challenged brain. Sauted the onion w/ bell pepper (no banana), and garlic cloves (yuck, garlic powder) and tossed everything in the crock pot b4 leaving for work. Left on low for about 8 hrs. and it was good, but just too mild for our taste. After adding extra hot sauce, cheese, cilantro (fresh), and of course TORTILLA chips, it was a good soup that I'll make again; the best parts were the chick peas, and the fact that my 3-year old demolished her whole bowl.

This was very easy. I read the review that said it was more than five servings so I pretty much cut the recipe in half for me, my husband and son.  There was still enough for me to bring a bowl for lunch!  I made a few changes to use what I had on hand.  I did 1.5c water, chicken bullion, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can of chicken, 1 can of black beans, frozen corn, sauted onions, 1 can of Rotel tomatoes, Adobo seasoning, Cumin, Garlic, and Pepper to taste.  Topped with sour cream, cheese, avacado and grilled tortillas.  I would have liked it a little more spice but I didn't want it to be too hot for my son so just added a little heat to the individual bowls.  Great Recipe.

The combination of ingredients gives this soup an extra something that the other recipes don't have. I didn't have black beans when I made this so I subbed with kidney beans. I also subbed canned corn for the hominy and did not add the banana pepper. I think it would be even better as written. The only change I will keep in the future is subbing all natural chicken broth for the water and bullion cubes. Cuts down on the salt and tastes even better. Overall a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made it according to the recipe, but with the following changes because of items on hand.  I added ground turkey breast instead of the canned chicken. Much lower in sodium.  I didn't have canned tomatoes w/chilies so I used plain chunked tomatoes  and added some chipotle chili pepper and red chili pepper to taste.  I also used corn instead of hominy and added Basmati rice.  My family likes a very hearty soup so this helped give it more substance.  Flavor is excellent! Thank you for the recipe!

This is an easy recipe to follow, and it makes a tasty soup. I substituted red beans for the garbanzo beans, and I left out the cream of chicken soup, and instead of the 4 cups of water I used chicken broth. It turned our delish! I thought it to be a tad bit spicy with the chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce,  so I just used salt and pepper with the cumin.  Great soup!

Very tasty and simple to make!
I love this recipe! It makes a ton of soup. I took it to a cookout and my friends were impressed that I made it. I add real garlic and half a fresh chopped jalepeno for a bolder flavor. It takes about 25 minutes to put together, and I let it simmer for 2 hours. I highly recommend it for a go-to soup recipe!

As many others mentioned this soup is excellent.  I followed the recipe with one exception.  I didn't have a banana pepper on hand so I omitted that.  This will definitely go in my recipe file for many future occasions.

This was  the first time I've tried this recipe; had saved another recipe a fews years back but hadn't got around to it yet.  This one is THE BEST soup I've made in a while!  And everyone else loved it too.  We had a smoked turkey during the holidays, so since it had already been seasoned with a cajun spice blend, I thought it would be a great flavor base for this type of soup.  I am going to be making this one again soon!!  Thanks for this post ShannyBanany!!!

Super easy.  Basically opened up a bunch of cans and poured into a pot.  I did make a few changes that made it a little spicier.  Used low sodium chicken broth, no banana pepper so used an anheim pepper and broiled it first in oven and took off the skin.  Used a can of diced tomatoes with habaneros to take it up a level. Only 1 can of cream of chicken soup (at this point I was getting concerned about sodium level).  Fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic salt. Fresh chopped cilantro (sprinkled on top after soup cooked).  NO franks red hot.  Used a chili seasoning to spice it up too.  Trying to figure out ways to salt level otherwise really good and easy!

I thought this was an excellent recipe with some revisions the second time around.

I cut, cubed, and saut√©ed 4 chicken breasts in a small amount of olive oil and set aside. Instead of chicken bouillon cubes mixed in water, I used six cups (48 oz) of chicken broth. I doubled the hominy and doubled all the seasonings, including the lime juice. Instead of cream of chicken soup, I used 1 cup of half and half, dissolving 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken.  I didn't need to add any salt or pepper either. This is my go to soup for parties and office gatherings.

Super yummy. I didn‚Äôt have any banana peppers and I substituted white pinto for the chickpeas, but everything else was as written. We added extra sharp cheddar and some seasoned tortilla strips to the top. Only thing I‚Äôll do differently next time is to use my own chicken instead of canned, but that‚Äôs just a taste preference. The canned chicken was fast and easy after a day of Black Friday shopping!

This was good, a little thin, so I added some rice, barley and corn tortillas which made it more of a stew, but it was really easy.  I don't like to use so many canned foods but in a pinch I will.  Also, the directions didn't say whether to drain the beans so I didn't.  I also halved the recipe.  It would've fed a batillion.

Super tasty! Made it vegetarian though so substituted veggie bouillon, cream of mushroom and left out the chicken. Added carrots and broccoli and of course tortilla's cut in strips and pan fried. Plated with lime, cilantro, tortilla strips and avo. Yum!  Thank you for sharing!

Phenomenal! Finally, a tortilla soup savory enough that it doesn't require cheese. I used frozen sweet corn, fire roasted tomatoes and some sweet Italian sausage as I didn't have any chicken and it was still great. Even better with some crumbled tortilla chips on top.

I would have given this give stars but the first time didn't come out as good as the second time because  I  made a few changes the second time. First I didn't see the reasoning behind draining the yummy juices from all the canned items and replacing them with plain water.  I reduced the water in the recipe to 2 cups and poured the entire contents of each can including the black beans into the soup.  I also diced raw chicken breasts and used them instead of canned chicken.  I began by adding the 2 cups of water, garlic, onion, pepper and the cream of chicken soup and boiled that until the onion began to turn clear.  I then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked it per the recipe.  Ten minutes before it was finished I added 1/2 cup of crushed tortilla chips, just to let it live up to its name.  It turned out excellent.

The only changes were to use frozen corn instead of the hominy and just one can of cream of chicken soup.   This soup was excellent.  Can't wait to make again.

I have made this more than 10 times now. It is delicious. A couple modifications, I used one can of diced tomatoes and two small cans of green chilies. I also added 1 chopped jalape√±o, 1 poblano pepper chopped,red wine to taste...gotta have the wine! Also I don't use canned chicken, I either pan fry two breasts or when my husband can...he grills them. Things I've learned: cook all the spices with the broth first, add the cans of beans and tomoatoes/ chilies and onion, wine...everything but the chicken and let it simmer a bit. Then cook the chicken..slice and add and allow to simmer again. This allows all the flavors to meld and riches the soup.

Was very good and will make again.  I substituted low sodium chicken broth instead of boullion.  Only added 1 can cream of chicken.  Ate with avacado, sour cream, cheddar cheese and a few chips.  Whole family enjoyed!!

Loved the soup but I made a few changes.  Instead of canned chicken I cooked a roasting chicken and well worth the effort.  Used a 5 lb chicken essentially covered with water and gently boiled for approx an hour until the chicken fell off the bones.  I removed the bones and added 1 1/2 chicken bouillon cubes to add a bit more chicken flavor.  I could not find banana peppers so used a similar mild type pepper and followed the rest of the instructions.  I cooked it  longer than 40 mins to let it boil down.  YUM!!  Definitely more than 5 servings.

This seemed like a great basic recipe but I wasn't so sure about adding cream of chicken soup, so I didn't.  I added pur√©ed tomatoes instead.  I have an awesome crock pot that lets me saut√©e then switch to a slow cooker.  I saut√©ed about a pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs, which I first cut into cubes.  Used others suggestion for broth instead of water and bullion.  I added everything else on top switching to slow cooker mode.  Added a can of Rotel with chilies along with more Frank's hot sauce .  Glad I increased the  proportions of all the ingredients or I doubt I'd have any soup left over.  I garnished with sharpe shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  Rather than tortillas (not sure where they were given the name of the recipe), I crisped up hard corn taco shells then broke them into a serving bowl to use as desired.  Those went, too.  Will definitely make this again!

Started with a slice of bacon, then onion.  I served it with tortilla strips, fresh mozzarella, and kaffir lime leaves.  Definitely company quality.

I cooked the diced onion and used a jalape√±o instead of a banana pepper. I used a rotisserie chicken instead of canned.  A little more work but well worth it.  Great flavor and just right medium spice/heat for me.  I did not add additional salt, didn't need any.  Topped with crispy tortilla strips and shredded jack cheese.  I will freeze half and definitely make again.

My family loved it which says a lot coming from my kids.  Made a few minor adjustments like chicken broth instead of boullion & water and parsley instead of cilantro only because that's what I had.  Great for a cold day!

The only change I made was I used a store bought Rotisserie 
Chicken instead of canned chicken.  It was delicious and easy to
make. One caveat ,I did not use gloves when I diced up the Banana Pepper.  BIG MISTAKE!!!! I am not used to cooking with
fresh  peppers.   Learned a lesson. I will  definitely make this again.

We made this for our monthly dinner group.  It was so simple with everything being in cans, yet everyone thought we slaved over it and thought it tasted fantastic!  They all raved about it and asked for the recipe.  The only change we made was halving the amount of onion.
