The flavors are all there in this recipe - but blue cheese does not spread.  I toasted the baguette slices with a little garlic infused olive oil then put on the blue cheese & prosiciutto and back into the broiler for a minute or so.  Then topped with the pear mixture.  Very tasty.  Thanks!  I made this for the Western Region Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

This recipe is amazing! I tweaked the method a bit to suit my tastes - I sauteed the onion and prosciutto first, then combined with the cheese to create a uniform mixture. I cut the baguettes in half instead of in slices because I found the bread was too small, but other than that it was great!

Instead of blue cheese, I used aged, sharp white cheddar with a Bosc pear. Delicious!

I was charged with bringing the appetizers to a large dinner recently.  These appetizers were the hit of the party! Everyone raved about them and they were gone within 5 minutes. The flavor combination of the pear, blue cheese and prosciutto  is amazing!

Loved this yummy bruschetta recipe! I served for Christmas Eve celebrations and it was a hit.  I did do some tweaking based on reviews and personal preferences.  I added whipped cream cheese to the blue cheese crumbles to make a creamy, spreadable mixture.  I'm not crazy about raw onions, so I diced a large red onion and sauteed with diced bacon until the bacon was crisp, then added balsamic vinegar and cooked down until reduced.  That went on top of the toasted baguettes slices with spread.  I topped with a slice of pear and chopped fresh thyme.  These were so pretty and tasty.  Definitely a do-over for sure.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

I just made this and it was absolutely delicious. I made crustinins out of it. I used chiabatta. Then broiled the blue cheese and prosciutto on the chiabatta then added pear mixture. yummy.  Eloquent and easy!

I mixed the blue cheese with a bit of cream cheese: easier to spread, and the flavor is not quite so intense (not everyone likes blue cheese).  I also let the mixture marinate more like 30 minutes. Big hit both times I've served it. In fact, it took 1st prize at a holiday appetizer party last night.

I'm not a fan of blue cheese so I make this work aged white cheddar and use Asian or Comice/Christmas pears depending on the season.  I drizzle balsamic reduction before serving.  Simple, elegant and always a crowd pleaser.

Blue cheese was too over powering.  I used danish blue cheese.  This also costs alot to make,and needs to be made shortly before your company comes. I need a recipe that is great if I am going to be in the kitchen cooking an hour before guest arrive.

I must have used the wrong size baguette because I had a ton of toppings left over and it takes a lot longer than 15 minutes. But SO GOOD!

I did this for brunch for just my husband and me.  It was great.  I used a toasted slice of french bread and then broiled the blue cheese on it until it softened a little so it spread.  I think I would use a little less red onion last time, but it was wonderful indeed.

We have this at every party we host and it is the 1st appetizer to be gone (even after doubling or tripling the batch).
