Wonderful!  I used Stove Top cornbread stuffing mix, added sauted onion.  I also added mild to the sour, plus just a dash of hot sauce.  I cooked the chops until they were nearly done and the stuffing was a bit crispy before adding the soup mixture.  We loved it!

A tasty recipe.  I did notice that there were no spices so I added, sage, thyme, & celery salt to the stuffing mixture.  Also, you probably should spray the pan with Pam or something to avoid sticking.  I also added 3/4 milk to the soup so that I could "pour" it over the chops.

This is much better than the rating appears. Just be sure to add spices to the bread crumbs: I like rosemary, celery salt, thyme, and a little bit of whatever else I might have on hand. Also, put some of the filling on top of the pork chops. It adds a delicious crust!

This dish gets 5 stars for my similar recipe that adds bacon wrapped around the stuffed chops. See my photo for the recipe. It's fit for a king!

This was excellent with a few modifications. I browned the pork chops in a skillet and also added a bit of salt, sage, celery seed, thyme, and rosemary to the stuffing mix. I used one can of corn and had to add about 1/3 cup of chicken broth to the stuffing mix to get it to the right consistency. Also added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of chicken broth to the soup just to make it easier to pour over the chops. Very, very good.  Thanks rainy918. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it really needed the herbs and chicken broth.

This was very good. I had read the other views and took someone's suggestion by addding some milk. Make sure you beat the egg before adding it to the breadcrumbs. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, however, it did go well with the pork. Unfortunately, hubby didn't like it. But hey, I'll be making more for the "other" family, hehe.

I added dried parsley, basil and onions to the stuffing and it was awesome! This is an autumn dish to me. I wasn't sure what to make with it and wasn't pleased with my sides. Next time I make it I will have mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes on the side or something.

Also a few modifications, but my husband LOVED this on a cold rainy night in Michigan.  I sauteed onion and celery in butter till soft, added chicken broth and my own seasoning blend, and added to seasoned bread crumbs and stirred in one beaten egg.  (I hate dry stuffing!)I eliminated the corn.  I also used the seasoning blend to season both sides of the butterflied pork loin.  I had extra stuffing, so I put that in the bottom of the dish, stuffed chops on top, and spooned the soup on top.  I cooked with a lid on for the first 30 min, and the lid off for the remaining time to get that crispiness everyone mentioned.  I served with roasted cauliflower.

This was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of pork chops but wow. I changed it a tiny bit by using Stove Top turkey stuffing mix. That was all I had in the house and also didn't have to add additional spices. Will definitely be making it again!

Very good!!!! This was my first attempt at pork chops and my fiance was very pleased. I did use stove top Italian herb stuffing, sliced mushrooms & I added fresh garlic, Italian seasoning, oregano, salt and pepper. Baked for 15 min then poured the cream of mush w/ a half cup of milk over covered with foil and baked another 30 min... Sided with mashed potatoes and brown gravy. Splened:D

This turned out awesome!  I made 3 different types.  One - by the recipe.  Two - Gorgonzola and Sun Dried Tomatoes.  Three - onions, mushrooms, and hot sauce.  I substituted a sleeve of saltine crackers in lieu of dry bread crumbs.  Fabulous!

I found the can of soup alone was to thick, so added milk to thin it out as others had suggested. I also added mushrooms to the gravy. I put grated parmesan cheese in the stuffing. Family loved this! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipsonings, so I added rosemary, tyme, salt & pepper then I drizzled a little olive oil on them. I used stovetops stuffing and added oninon and celery to it. Half way through baking I covered them in Golden mushroom soup instead of creamy mushroom. I like gravy better than the more fattening creamy soup. They turned out perfect and so full of flavor. Try using  these tips to improve this recipe! Also, the gravy is great with mashed or a baked potatoe.

This is a great recipe...I added some Nature's Seasoning, Mrs. Dash- Garlic and Herb, Black Pepper and Garlic Pepper to the stuffing. Instead of stuffing the pork chops, I covered the pork chops with the stuffing and it was delicious.

This turned out well. I was desperate for a stuffing that did not call for celery or day old bread and this worked. Honestly, it did not LOOK as good as it tasted, but the 14 year old had seconds and my husband ate it right up as did the 4 year old. Will make again. I did listen to those who upon cooking it said to add spice. I used seasoned bread crumb mix and added garlic salt and fresh diced white onion to the stuffing. A touch of milk as well to the soup to make it easier to work with. Thanks for this one!

Very good! I added some chopped red onion into the stuffing and also used fresh corn off the cob because 'tis the season. Added some fresh herbs from the garden, too. I am not a fan of cream of anything soups, so instead I used plain yogurt mixed with a little lemon juice and cumin, spread on top of the chops, and topped that with a bit more stuffing mix. Baked with foil on for 30 minutes and foil off for 15.

Yummy and melt in your mouth...with a few changes. I used Italian bread crumbs and added a little garlic and onion. I also waited til about 10 mintues before taking them out of the oven to put a milk & cream of mushroom sauce on top. (Kind of used it as a gravy) Served it with fresh asparagas-yummy!

It's a good recipe to start from but you definitely need to add your own "touch" to it.  I used Italian bread crumbs and added some thyme, rosemary and Parmesan cheese.  I also made my own cream sauce to top them with as I do not like mushrooms and fortunately happened to have some cream left over from something else.

I thought this was delicious & husband ate so much he had to take a nap afterwards :-)  I took some advise from previous reviews and added some spices and used the Stove Top Cornbread stuffing.  Will have to make again :-)

My honey loved this and asks for it all the time! I made too much stuffing last time and froze the leftovers, next time I made the chops I just pulled it out of the freezer and let it thaw before I stuffed them. They turned out great again!

Yum Yum!  I took the advice of others, and used a stuffing mix in place of breadcrumbs (to add a light seasoning without going overboard).  Made it for dinner with the in-laws, and no one could get enough.  Even the kids were asking for more!

Nice concept, but way too bland for my taste. I will try them again, but next time, I will add more spices for a little kick.

These were 'ok' at best. Chops were dry and cheese leaked out. Needs binding ingredient. Not sure what would work on the grill. Probably won't make these again.

Absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend couldn't stop raving.  His dad stopped by the next day for leftovers and since then always mentions them when I see him!  I followed the other suggestion to add some spices - otherwise it is great as is.

Pretty good. My chops were huge (probably 2"). I used Italian Bread Crumbs & wasn't too crazy about the corn. Next time I'll mix some milk in with the soup. I don't like globs of mushroom soup.

This was wonderful in my opinion. Chops were juicy almosy falls apart in your mouth. Will definately make again. I did make a few minor changes due to what I like. I used chicken broth in place of milk to thin down soup. and added sage to the stuffing mix with freshly ground black pepper. This was amazing

suprisingly this was very good. the flavor of real stuffing is there, the only complaint was that the stuffing was mushy. this is a good recipe when your cupboards are getting low. i will make this again definatly.

I've made this recipe twice so far.  Once as directed in the recipe and once with the stuggestions given by KYRAP.  The spices really helped out with the bland taste of the stuffing and the adding the milk to the soup really made it easier to pour over top.  Four stars!! (when made with the suggestions)  :-D

Simple recipe- if you have the time, it's worth adding onions, celery, and/or carrots and certainly some spices. I also used croutons instead of bread crumbs for added flavor. Otherwise it was my first time stuffing a chop- success!

Solid pork chop recipe.  They came out tender and juicy.  Very filling!  (that may be because I overstuffed them a bit!)  I left the butter out (forgot it) but it wasn't missed.  There was extra stuffing after filling them, so I put it on top with the mushroom soup.  Boyfriend was happy, ate the leftovers for the next 2 days!

Maybe this wasn't as good as I was expecting due to the fact my chops weren't butterflied and I was using cream of celery soup.  It was alright, but not great.  I will try again with the correct ingreds, and if it is better, I will keep.  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy to make, and turned out nice and moist. I used a stove top stuffing mix for pork, and substituted cream of celery soup instead of mushroom soup only because of my anti mushroom husband! The celery soup gave it a light flavor.

Simple and great.  Just like mom used to make.

When the meat was 155 F I removed it from the oven and pan seared both sides in a skillet over high heat for about 3 minutes per side.

I made extras because we knew we'd want them for lunch.

I've made this several times and it's awesome!  I do cheat and use Stove Top cornbread stuffing and mix a little milk with the mushroom soup for a little more creaminess.

I didn't have any GF bread crumbs on hand so I cubed up cinnamon raisin gluten-free bread and then added some thyme leaves and fennel to the recipe. It was amazing!

Instead of making the stuffing from scratch, I used Stove top.  It still was great.

Delish! I used cornbread stuffing mix rather than breadcrumbs. The soup poured over alone was too thick and the extra stuffing was too dry so I used a second can of cream of mushroom soup and about a quarter can of milk to create a gravy. Added fresh mushrooms to that because our house loves mushrooms. This stuffing makes a lot so be prepared to feed an army, freeze, or reduce the recipe.

Easy, yummy, comfort food!  Changed the recipe a bit. Added freshly sautéed mushrooms and frozen corn I had frozen from the summer crop. Adds a bit more flavor and moistness!

I made this last night with homemade bread crumb stuffing (pureed corn flakes and stuffing croutons crushed) with fresh purple sage from my herb garden along with 1/4 t garlic powder, 1/4 t onion powder, 1/8 t celery salt.  Next time I will add additional spices such as fresh rosemary & thyme. It did turn out excellent & I was pleasantly surprised.  I put a small amount of the mushroom soup on the bottom to coat for non-stick & then covered the chops with the soup & pressed the remaining stuffing on top of the chops. The corn gave a nice sweetness to the dish.  Cooking time was accurate for thick cut butterflied chops with stuffing per meat thermometer. Served with fresh picked beans sauteed with onions and bacon.  Will make again & thanks for sharing RAINY918.

I did a little something different. I mixed the creamed mushroom soup with one can of milk and poured it over the stuffed pork chop.
Was a big hit with the family. When I make it again I will double or triple the soup mixture if I am making mashed potatoes. It was so tender. thank you for a great recipe!

Not impressed.  I added green onion, red pepper, poultry seasoning and still thought pretty bland.

First time making Stuffed Chops, quick and easy! I did substitute Cream of Cheddar Soup for the Cream of Mushroom simply because I already had it. Very tasty.
