This was an excellent recipe for lamb chops.  There are many recipes for the ras el hanout (many that require saffron - which I don't have).  I took a basic recipe and modified it with spices I had on hand.  This is what I used:

Ras El Hanout alla Mark
3  teaspoons ground cinnamon  
3  teaspoons ground cumin  
2  teaspoons ground coriander  
2  teaspoons ground ginger  
2  teaspoons ground cardamom  
1  teaspoon ground allspice  
1  teaspoon ground cloves  
1  teaspoon mace  
1  teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1  teaspoon garlic powder  
1  teaspoon dill
1  teaspoon ground black pepper
1  teaspoon Kosher Salt

The cinnamon, cumin and red pepper are what are really required, everything else adds to the "complexity" of the flavor.  The Shiraz honey reduction was very good (and easy to make) although it took about 20 minutes to reduce.

This dish was simply outstanding. I made my own ras el hanout from (mostly) whole spices. Also, 145 degrees as an internal temperature is probably as well-done as you should cook rack of lamb. 130 degrees is medium and 145 is more like medium-well. I'd suggest just cooking to 130 or so.

This recipe was delicious - thank you so much for introducing me to this wonderful spice! I actually used boneless leg of lamb for a meatier cut, therefore changing the cooking directions accordingly and using a little more spice. I even had no trouble finding the spice at my local grocery store (I do live in a big city though).

Amazing.  I have been meaning to try this recipe for more than 2 years, and I am so glad I finally did!
I had to make my own spice mix (http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/raselhanout.html) because I couldn't find it in stores, and it turned out well.  The lamb was tender and flavorful, and the sauce...oh the sauce...my friend kept saying she wanted to drink it.  Delicious!  Definitely will be making it again!
Thanks for the post!

I almost didn't leave a review for this because I used it on pork & don't want to offend anybody. Accept my apologies in advance if I have done so. Anyway, I had some leftover pork medallions (seasoned w/ a bit of salt & pepper & sauteed in EVOO) & thought I would try this glaze on them. Just for grins, I also made the ras el hanout (googled a recipe) & sprinkled a bit on a couple of the medallions before I reheated them. (I sprinkled them w/ some water to keep them from drying out, then the spices, then heated them in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes while I prepared the glaze). The medallions that didn't have the spices were too sweet from the glaze (it reminded me of a grape jelly glaze but I'm sure the addition of meat drippings, which I didn't use, would add an extra dimension of flavor) but the ones w/ the spices were wonderful! We loved the spices w/ the glaze...I'm so glad I tried it on pork. I served it w/ curried shrimp bisque & a salad w/ hot buttered apple cider for dessert. Thnaks for a very enjoyable recipe, Lissa Metz-Gomez!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This was the best lamb I ever ate, although it was a little rare and we had to nuke the chops a little.  Next time I will cook it longer (or find my thermometer).  I had to make my own ras el hanout -- using the recipe with the cumin.  I have practically been dreaming about it ever since!  I would get a head start on that wine reduction sauce though, it takes a while to cook.  Also I cut the sauce recipe in half because I always have sauce leftover (maybe I just don't cook it long enough).

This was absolutely fantastic. I never add any reviews but decided to add the review for this one as it is such a great recipe but has very few reviews. Minor things I did differently - rubbed the rack of lamb with a bit of olive oil before seasoning and added a bit more honey to the sauce (might not be suited to everyone's taste). I used oil because the seasoning was not sticking on without it. I also added a bit of olive oil in the pan for searing. It was perfect - no left overs.

Amazing! I mixed the spices myself for the ras el hanout and it turned out great! Think I might try it on some chiken next time to try and make it healthier though...

This is crazy good!  I made this for a dinner party and even guests who didn't think that they'd like lamb loved it.  I'm definately going to make this again.

I actually applied the rub to chicken, not lamb and cooked it accordingly, but I must say, that wine/honey sauce with this blend of spices is AMAZING!  I just wish I'd been introduced to it sooner.

This is officially my favorite Lamb Dish of All Time.  The ras el-hanout added spectacular flavor and the sauce was a silky pot of yum.  I'm always thrilled to find a recipe that delivers this much flavor for so little effort.

This was amazingly delicious!  The flavor from the ras el hanout rub was absolutely 'top shelf'.  We felt like we had just dined in a 5-star restaurant.  I made just a mushroom risotto to accompany it, and left-overs were non existent!!  Wonderful!

The smallest rack I could find had 8 bones and my husband said it wasn't enough! (it was just the 2 of us!!!) As I was doing the wine reduction, I added some carrots and cooked them during that time- turned out quite delicious with almost like a glaze! Served with garlic mashed potatoes... FANTASTIC first experience eating (let alone cooking!) lamb! Will definitely make again! Husband didn't even complain about the "bite" in the spice- the sweeter reduction made a nice compliment to the spice rub! *EDIT* Made similar dish tonight with boneless skinless chicken breast- rubbed with the spice, seared and baked just like this recipe. Added in sliced onion with the wine/honey and it was quite delicious. As much as I LOVE this recipe, the cost of the lamb (not to mention nutritional value overload!!!) makes it unreasonable to have it on a regular basis. Nice to know it works just as well with chicken- and I want to try it with a pork roast!

I liked this recipe. I have to say I found on the internet the Ras al Hanout but I made enough to last forever and share. I probably put too much on the lamb, which I boned out for simplicity later. My Husband scraped off the seasoning and then he thought the lamb was great. I did love the Shiraz Honey Sauce. I would make this again but will use a bit less of the seasoning.

Delicious and easy recipe. Got the Ras el Hanout from Zamouri on Amazon which was delicious! My only problem was that the sauce was a bit thin...next time (and there will be one) I might add a tiny bit of corn starch to thicken it up. GREAT recipe.

My wife and I both loved this, especially the sauce!  I didn't measure the ras el hanout, but next time I will use more.  I cooked the lamb rack to 135, which only took about 25 minutes, and I would consider the end result medium.  Next time I'll take it out when it reaches 130.  We'll be having this again soon!

We also made the ras el hanout mixture similar to one of the other reviewers.  This is the first time we've cooked lamb and it turned out excellent!  After searing it we put it on a rottiserie grill.  YUM!

This recipe will make your toes curl in ecstasy, it's really that good. I made it for a morrocan themed dinner and wowed my guests. It went particularly well with the dessert: bacon wraped, blue cheese stuffed... dates.

I used store bought Ras el Hanout and followed the recipe closely, although I switched up the meat from all ribs to half ribs and half chops

I made this recipe for New Year's eve with friends using chicken tenderloins on wooden skewers. It was amazing! Even the pickiest eaters loved it! We made our own ras el hanout since we had all of the spices and it was delicious. The sauce was perfect. I can't wait to try it with lamb! Thank you for sharing!

This was fantastic. It looked too easy so I was skeptical, but it was actually amazing. Ras El Hanout was hard to find - but I managed to get some at Cost Plus!

Thumbs up! Probably one of the best dinners I ever cooked. The lamb was amazing, so was the sauce. Next time, I'll add the suggested sides - the couscous I made did not stand up as it should have against this very flavorful dish.

I just made this for Christmas dinner and even the pickiest eaters devoured it!  I couldn't find Ras el hanout to save my life, but was able to make it myself fairly easily.  I will definitely add this recipe to my repertoire.

Husband liked this very much. Didn't have shiraz so used Merlot. Didn't have the spice at my supermarket so I used this recipe from myrecipes.com: 2 teaspoons  ground ginger  2  teaspoons  ground coriander  1 1/2  teaspoons  ground cinnamon  1 1/2  teaspoons  freshly ground black pepper  1 1/2  teaspoons  ground turmeric  1 1/4  teaspoons  ground nutmeg  1  teaspoon  ground allspice  1/2  teaspoon  ground cloves  Makes about 3.5 TBSP. Left out coriander because DH doesn't like it. This was one to impress dinner guests. Will make again.

This is one of my top 3 favorite lamb recipes of all time.  I went online and ordered this special spice just so I could make this recipe and it was so worth it. I have made this many times and there is never anything left over.  We end up sucking on the bones and licking our plates!  The only time it failed was when I was in a hurry and I reduced the wine-honey mixture at too high of a temperature and the sugar ended up hardening after pouring the sauce on the lamb.  We ended up with candied lamb!  Oops!  So be patient and reduce the wine-honey mixture over medium heat as it says, never high!

I googled a few ras el hanout recipes and created my own for this dish.I preseasoned with the ras el hanout and added onion and garlic powders. I enjoyed the lamb with rosemary sweet potatoes with the sauce drizzled on the lamb and sweet potatoes.

I had to completely modify the sauce; we live in Lithuania and the ras el hanout was unavailable. Nevertheless, the wine and honey sauce was incredible. I based my other sauce on ras el hanout and it turned out beautifully. This is a great recipe and helped make the holiday meal grand. Thank you!

I don't eat lamb, however, I cook it for my husband because he loves it.  I tried this recipe for him and he absolutely loves it.  We bought the ras el hanout from an online store.  The recipe is really easy to make and according to my husband it is restaurant quality.  Thanks LotusX for a great recipe :-)

Use Fess Parker Shiraz.  Asparagus with cream butter and lemon zest works well.  Cook at least 4 shoulder steaks for Taylor, Ang and Troy.

The reduction sauce is absolutely amazing. Couldn't find ras el hanout at the supermarket so I had to go to a specialty Mediterranean store. It was worth it! This ones a keeper.

We made this for an impromptu Christmas Eve dinner with friends.  We decided to substitute a pork loin for the lamb since it was more cost effective and would feed our small crowd.  My husband already had a Ras el Hanout spice mix on hand that he's been experimenting with so this was perfect.  He also added some pre-made au jus that was in our fridge to add more richness to the sauce.  It was fabulous.

As soon as I saw this recipe I had to make it, but I didn't have lamb on hand. So I made it with chicken breasts. It was phenomenal. Watch out because the sauce is so sweet, you just need a dribble - I will make this again.

This was spectacular.  I made it with an online recipe for ras el hanout.  You need to keep the lamb warm while you are reducing the sauce - it takes 20 or 30 minutes to get it really syrupy. Great recipe.

Wow!  This was so easy and absolutely delicious!  I couldn't find Ras el hanout at my spice shop, but there are tons of recipes for it on the net, so I just read a handful and improvised with what I had on hand and now I've got a new favorite blend for all sorts of dishes.
Thanks!

Best rack of lamb ever! I made my own raw el hanout seasoning mix using the suggestions made by mdelduke in her review. However, I used whole coriander, cumin, cloves, allspice, and a peppercorn. I dry roasted them until they were fragrant and then grounded them and added the other spices. I also reduced the amount for the whole spices. We didm't have any Shiraz so I just used a nice red wine. The combination of the sweet sauce with the flavorful spices on the lamb was amazing.

Thanks for the fabulous recipe.  DH said best meal he's eaten in months!  I looked at the ingredients for the spice blend which another reviewer posted and checked the label on the garam masala (indian spice blend) in my spice cabinet, and it was almost identical.  I just added a little more cinnamon to the garam masala, and it worked perfectly.  There was extra spice left after I coated the lamb, so I threw the rest in with the basmati rice I was cooking along w/ some peas--it was great with the lamb.  If you like your meat rarer, try 20 minutes cooking time; that was perfect for us.  We love shiraz, but already had cab open, so used cab in the sauce.  The sauce was excellent!  Make sure to reduce it to a thick sauce; mine turned out really rich and thick, almost like a great aged balsalmic vinegar-yummmm!  Thanks for sharing a winner!

We really loved the flavor and juiciness  the ras el hanout  seasoning provided to the lamb rack. The sauce was a bit sweet for us, but can correct that next time.  The ras el hanout started to burn when searing the rack over medium high heat,  so would recommend searing on medium heat. This one's a keeper.

Soooo good! Great recipe.   I used lamb ribs, and made my own ras el hanout. I used Merlot for the wine/honey  sauce, cooked it down till thick, it was delicious. I can see the wine sauce working well for pork, duck or venison! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.  10 solid stars!

This was amazing, the first time i've used ras el hanout,  everyone loved the flavor. I will be making this on the grill next time,  maybe go with a slightly lower internal temperature, I like my lamb on the rare side. Meat was tender and moist, and the seasoning is on point.

This was the best rack of lamb we have every eaten and this includes restaurant meals. Looking forward to trying it with other cuts of meat.
We made our own Ras el Hanout from a recipe found here on Allrecipes.com.

This is a warm wondetful dish that my whole family enjoyed. The recipe would work well with beef ribs also. The shiraz honey sauce is amazing.
