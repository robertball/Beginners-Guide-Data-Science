Lovely, light, summer salad. Hubby, who NEVER eats salads, said, "Great salad, Babe!" That's good enough for me.

I was looking for a Hoppin John recipe for New Year's Day and chose this salad since it was about 80 degrees in Phoenix today, and this sounded much better than hot soup!  I used cubed ham instead of the crabmeat, but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe.  It was excellent!  For summer, I'll definitely try the crab, but we loved it with the ham.

Being down in Florida, salad is a year 'round thing, so I make this every single New Years Day! 

The only thing I do differently is to chop the tomatoes and serve the salad over greens.
