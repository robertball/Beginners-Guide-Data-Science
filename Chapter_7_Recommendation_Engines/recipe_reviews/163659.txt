My wife and I really enjoyed this.  I had to tinker with the recipe a bit based on what was on hand, but it worked out great.  I used fennel seeds, but didn't have any fennel, so I substituted with celery.  Turned out fine, but I'm interested to try it with the fennel now.

Delicious. I used puff pastry since that was what I had. I skipped the fresh fennel since I didn't have any, but look forward to trying that next time. 30 minutes was plenty of time. Overcooking it will make it hard, so be careful.

This was a huge hit!  My husband's family had their own version of Iron Chef and fennel was one of the ingredients we had to use.  I made this recipe and it was voted #1...  Will definitely make it again.  Thank you.

Delicious.  The fennel gave the dish a wonderfully subtle flavor.  I brushed the loafs with egg yolk and actually baked this in a convection toaster oven on a broiler rack and pan.  I needed a little longer cooking time than the recipe called for, but an instant read thermometer helped determine when it was done.  The loaves had beautiful golden brown crusts and the slices made a nice presentation on the plate.  We enjoyed them the second day by reheating a loaf in the toaster oven.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was excellent!  My hubby is skeptical to new recipes, and he loved it!  I didn't have fennel, so I cut it out.  I also left out the bread crumbs.  I just added a little more fennel seeds to the recipe to make up for the lack of fennel (just a dash), and it truly came out absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make it again and add it to my personal recipe collection!

This was good but it came up short of great.   I really enjoy real beef wellington and I was hoping this would come close.   It did not come close.   This is a meat ball inside pastry.     I'll save my pennies and have a real beef wellington next time.

I am always looking for ways to be creative with ground beef.  Not such an easy task sometime.  I tried this recipe and my husband and I really loved it!  I read the other reviews about too much fennel, so I cut back on the fresh fennel.  Next time I won't...because we both really loved it when we got a bite of the fresh stuff.  Next time, we'll add the suggested amount.  
It was very simple to make - the only thing we may do is maybe add a little celery of peas.  Regardless, we WILL be making this again!

My husband loved this!  I didn't have fennel and so sauteed chopped celery along with the onion.  I'm not sure if I misjudged the amount of beef I was using, but the crescent rolls weren't big enough to hold all of the meat mixture.  But no problem - I made a few "meatballs" for my 3-year-old to dip in ketchup by putting the extra meat in a muffin pan to cook along with the beef wellington (and he ate it!).  A hit all around.

I could not find my original recipe for ground beef wellington so I looked on here. I'm giving it 4 stars because I left out the fennel and red pepper flakes. Other than that it's just like my original which is a 5 star recipe to me and my family!

At first I thought this was just meatloaf wrapped with crescent rolls- but I was shocked at how extremely delicious it turned out to be!  My 5 year old is THEE pickiest eater on the planet and absolutely loved this.  By the way, I did not have fresh chopped fennel and substituted green onion for it instead- it still came out excellent.  The crushed red pepper gives it that extra kick that makes this meal more than a meatloaf in crescent rolls, but it's not too spicy that little kids or people averse to hot foods wouldn't like it.  I will definitely be making this again!

We had a little too much meat, so we made a patty and fried it up on the side as a burger to taste while the loaf baked. It's delicious, even without the fennel (which wasn't in stock at the grocery stores closest to us)! As stated, we had to leave out the fennel, but used more onion and garlic. Used 1/2 tsp. of the chili flakes, homemade bread crumbs (made from a variety of breads) and fresh parsley. I've seen a recipe on AR for traditional wellington that spread some liver pate on the inside, so I did that for this one. This came out a little moist on the bottom, but that's okay. It was a good recipe to use since I had pretty much everything on hand. Definitely saving this to make as burgers too!

Since AllRecipes can re-calculate serving size, I made a test portion, and it was DELICIOUS!!  I can't wait until the rest comes out of the oven.  I put more red pepper than suggested, and it gave it the perfect kick!

I have mixed feelings about this.   The bites with fennel/onion were good, but without it was very bland.  I mixed it really good but still did not have a consistent flavor.    If I try again I will either use less beef or more fennel/onion/garlic/crushed red pepper.     I used the lower fat crescent rolls and they worked well.   Will try again.

ok so i've got this in the oven right now and from what i can tell so far, it smells good and looks like a meatloaf wrapped in pastry. not complaining, but can someone post a picture of this? even if you didn't like it could you please post so i can see what it looks like? also, the description says "with a hint of chile..." where is the chile? is it supposed to be the tiny bit of red pepper? i can already tell it needs more kick to it. going to add some cajun sunshine hot pepper sauce to it in about 25 minutes. sauce is a really good chicken marinade too!

I left out the fennel, and used chopped celery, sage  and worchestershire sauce instead. I would recommend  using two packages of cresent rolls, and make smaller wellingtons. It turned out great! Will definitely make again.

Excellent!!! I also thought that this might be too much like meatloaf. Boy was I wrong! Even my 4 year old daughter adored it! I did tweak a few things. I caramelized the onion and fennel, I used one small onion and one bulb of fennel. I also used puff pastry, and baked on a broiler pan. My only complaint is that the recipe should have specified lean ground beef. Mine turned out to be a little greasy, even using the broiler pan. I will certainly be making this again! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was a truly delicious recipe - although a little heavy on the fennel. I changed this up a bit - I used 2 mini Crescent rolls to make small, single servings. If you prepare the entire pound of beef, you'll need 16 rolls total to create 8 mini Wellingtons, which are great for freezing for lunches, etc. I will certainly be enjoying this recipe with my family again.

My husband and I LOVED this!!  And it was so easy.  Like others, I did not have fresh fennel, but I will the next time.  

I made everything exactly as listed but I made a mushroom sauce instead of using tomato sauce (which I found with another beef wellington recipe).  It was wonderful and I will use it again - but my husband and I love mushrooms!

Mushroom sauce (if you want it):  1/2 cup fresh chopped mushrooms.  1 TLB butter.  2 tsp flour.  1/8 tsp pepper. 1/2 Cup half-n-half cream.   Saute mushrooms until softened.  Add in flour and pepper and slowly bring to boil. Boil and stir about 2 minutes until thickened.  (you could triple this recipe if you like sauce!) 

I served with a fresh vegetable.  This was delicious and will be in my regular rotation.

It was a great idea, I am not a fennel person, so I flavored it with garlic and other herbs that I like. I also made a dipping sauce with mustard and ketchup and a little bit of brown sugar...it was yummy :)

I followed the recipe exactly and got wonderful results. I used crescent rolls. My first instinct was to eliminate the fennel bulb, but after reading all the reviews decided to give it a try and am I ever glad I did, it really gave the dish a nice flavor, very unique. My husband loved it also. Easy, flavorful and economical. Thank you for sharing.

I made this tonight for my family.  It was awesome!  I happened to have everything minus fennel in the house which made it even easier.  Quickly picked up fennel from the store and after googling how to chop it, successfully whipped up the entree.  WOW this was really, really good and super easy.  Steamed some brocc and we had an amazing family meal!

I made this for dinner last night. It is a very simple recipe and it's delicious! I didn't have any fennel so I just added a bit more onion. We prefer the flavor of onion anyway. As others have mentioned, I felt that if I made two large ones as suggested in the recipe that it would end up with the crust burned and the inside uncooked. So I took the suggestion of some other reviewers and made four smaller ones. They came out perfect! I was afraid that the grease from the ground beef would make the dough slimy and soggy but it didn't all! I was actually surprised to see that the grease snuck out through the perforations in the pastry dough leaving the dough nice and flaky and the inside still juicy without being overly greasy. We served this with brown gravy. My husband and I both loved it. This is definitely going into our rotation for weeknight meals. It is easy, quick, and very tasty. I will have to find some fennel and try that next time.

I was doubtful that two kinds of fennel would work and I found it didn't. I made this tonight and 2/3 of us gave it a thumbs down. 350 for 30 minutes is too high for the pastry and 30 min not enough to cook the ground beef--I had dark brown pastry & some raw ground beef. The pastry worked well and sealed fine despite the perforated holes in the dough, so i liked that part of the recipe.

Cooking with FEnnel was fun!  It was my first time cooking with FEnnel.  This was very flavorful.  I would like to use this as my "go to" meatball recipe.  This is a Meatball in a pastry.. it's not the good 'ol Beef Wellington.  This recipe needs a different name.  Beef Wellingtons use mushrooms and pate and whole cuts of beef.. so this recipe is not close to "beef wellington".

This was so good.  I was a little nervous about making this because I had never used or tried Fennel before but I have to say that everyone in my house loved it.  My son who loves to complain about food ate every bite and my boyfried said we need to make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

My family really liked the flavors in the meat.  I did not have enough time to cook the meat into small meatloaves, so I cooked this as a crumble in a skillet, then added some butter, flour and milk after the meat was cooked to make a gravy, and served it over 10 minute brown rice with a green vegetable.  Very good and quick for a weeknight meal.

I made mine with homemade biscuit dough and no fennel - wish I had some, but this was one of those days where I was searching for what the heck to do with the thawed ground beef in my fridge. Not very pretty! The hot beef immediately started melting the dough. But they taste good, so.. 3 stars :)

It was just okay. I don't know if I don't like fennel or what because the rest of my family is saying it's great, but they may just be kissing up. Ha. :) It is something different to do with ground beef however. It's just really dry.

Not being familiar with fennel I was hesitant making this but the other great reviews changed my mind. I'm sure glad they did! This was fabulous! The flavor outstanding!  I made the recipe exactly as written except for omitting the fresh fennel . I bought fennel seeds and added more like the other reviewer suggested. Truly this was one of the best dishes I have made in years and I can't wait to share it with friends.

Made as is minus fennel, because I don’t like fennel.  Used celery instead. Tent with foil if the crescent roll is browning too much and use a meat thermometer.  Served with mushroom gravy and veggies, thanks for the recipe!

I actually misread the instructions and made 4 individual loaves.  I didn’t use the fresh fennel - didn’t have it so I “upped” the onion.  Everything else was as printed and I served it with a flavored Hunts tomato sauce.  The adult family loved it.  The super picky eaters, no so much.  My only caution is that the bottom dough didn’t seem fully cooked.  However, the time and temp were spot on for the meat.

I was looking for something different to do with ground beef and I found this recipe. I needed to learn about fennel. I found it in the grocery store under its other name, anise. I followed this recipe exactly. My actual cooking time was closer to 40 minutes. We enjoyed this. The fennel and other flavors give the ground beef a taste similar to Italian sausage.

I made this for the husband and I last night. I did not use fennel or fennel seeds, as I don't care for either, and it was still very good and moist. I did as another reviewer suggested and put an egg wash on top my pastry before putting it in the oven. Glad I did. My only suggestion would be to turn the heat on the stove even lower to help prevent scorching while sauteing the onion mixture. I will be making this again.

I have made this recipe many times and it’s great every time.  I use the big and flaky crescent rolls as well as the leanest meat I can find so it’s not super greasy and soft at the bottom.  I also have never had Fennel, only fennel seeds so use a little bit more of that and it turns out perfect for our taste.

Loved it!  Followed recipe exactly with the one exception of baking on a sheet of parchment paper instead of lightly greased pan.  I had never cooked with fresh fennel before so I did have to pull up a YouTube for guidance. This will become a regular so, I’m thinking I could freeze this into loafs and thaw when ready to use and just wrap in the crescent dough to bake

I substituted the fresh fennel for 1/4 cup of green onions and 1/3 cup of celery. I followed the rest of the recipe - It was fantastic! The family loved it and they requested that this dish be incorporated this into our menu! Def will make again! I’m curious what difference the fennel will make in flavor!

Followed recipe exactly...it's usually what I do the first time making something new.  Don't need to change or add anything.  The red pepper flakes made a huge difference as far as adding spice without being too spicy.  Will definitely make it again...and I can think of many variations that would be a great alternative...just to keep us from getting tired of the same recipe over and over.  Thanks for this one

Made it last night, flavor was good but turned out super dry. Could be because we used our own fresh beef, which is much leaner than store bought. We tried to think of what to add (cream cheese, tomato/chile, etc.) to correct. Probably won't make it again.

Don't kid yourself into thinking it's going to sell itself as Beef Wellington. . .  HOWEVER -- It's a very good, and more cost-efficient alternative.

Like other reviewers, I really liked the taste thanks to the fennel.  Really a nice touch.  Also, the crescent rolls worked well for us.

The only real downfall was of my own doing.  I over-mixed the meat and it became like a very dense meatloaf.  Bad on me.

But I say dig in.  It's a quick, easy, and inexpensive alternative when you want to have a more upscale-tasting dinner.

I thought it was great! I didn't have crescent rolls, so I used the grands flaky rolls. I  smooshed them down and rolled them flat. i added some Worcestershire sauce and did an egg wash on top...looked and tasted fantastic! the fennel gives such a zing

My boyfriend liked it.  I thought it was okay. I made a few changes.  I made mine in layers like a lasagna and on top I added salsa and then later a dollop of sour cream.

Super easy and everyone loved this.  Did not change anything ingredient wise. I did bake on parchment paper as opposed to greasing the pan. The fennel imparts a unique flavor. If you cannot find fresh anise/fennel, I think  you could throw in some celery for the texture. Just add a bit more of the fennel seed. will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Had a great flavor and the shell was perfect.  I had used the buttered rolls but next time will use the regular as the buttered made it a bit too rich.

This turned out pretty good. Substituted fennel with celery but kept the rest the same. The whole family loved it, except the wife who doesn't like crescent rolls. But she loved the meat.

I followed the recipe as written except that I used anise instead of fennel. It turned out great and looks impressive. We started with French onion soup then served the beef with steamed whole baby potatoes and steamed carrots. I also made a beef gravy which was nice drizzled over everything. A keeper recipe for sure.

Wow! Yummy, keeper! I adjusted the recipe slightly. My Fennel seeds were past the expiration date so they were omitted and I used puff pastry. I served this with mashed red-skinned potatoes, broccoli spears and gravy.

I made this dish per the recipe. I knew that it would not even approximate real beef Wellington but I was looking for interesting ways to prepare ground beef. I also really liked that this recipe called for fennel.  I wanted this to be good but it was bland ground beef wrapped in pastry that was pretty soggy. My family tried to eat it but we all had to admit that it just was not very good.

Great recipe!  Ok I always laugh at the reviewer who review a recipe and then change it in their review.  But here I go.  The market did not have fennel and my pantry was out of fennel seeds.  I used a teaspoon of tarragon instead.  To get some veggies into my husband's diet I added chopped 1/2 cup orange bell peppers, 1/4 thinly sliced celery and 5 chopped baby bell mushrooms to the onions and garlic mix.  This was so yummy.  Husband was happy and said this ranks high in his list.  This recipe is very versatile, I think they are lots of ways to change it up.

This was great.  Easy meal the whole family will love.  I really liked the fennel taste, although I didn't have any fresh, so I just chopped up extra seed.  I was looking for a meal I could make with a bunch of left over ground beef I had used the day before to make tacos.  So, my beef was already cooked, but it was still delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I did however put sliced mushrooms on top of the meat before wrapping. As well served with an au jus/gravy I made from beef boullion. Thank you for the great reciipe.

Absolutely delicious!! Used all fennel seed instead of fresh chopped fennel and that worked fine.  As I read in antoher review be sure not to overcook.  It literally takes 30 mins on 350.

This was easy to make and the flavors are great. We will also be using this recipe to make meatballs with as well.

Mmmm.  yummy.  I am gluten-free, so added gluten free crumbs, and left off the crust.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Added fresh parsley instead of dried.  I made large meat balls, and placed them in a cupcake tin.  Placed foil underneath in the oven for spillover.  They were moist and delish.  My fiancee had the ketchup out, but said, "mmm, it doesn't even need ketchup!"  Will make again!  I love fennel!

I was very impressed with this meal.  I thought the sweetness of the cresant roll made the meal.  I added some diced chillie to one, but could not tell the difference.  The one thing I would do to improve this meal is drink more wine.
