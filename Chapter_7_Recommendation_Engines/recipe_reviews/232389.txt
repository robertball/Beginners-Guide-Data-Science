Fruity and sweet, these go down way too easily, and they were a pretty hit for my office's happy hour. I found them a smidge too sweet, so I'll sub club soda and ice for the lemon-lime soda next time. A couple changes made them even easier: I marinated the strawberries in the tequila right in my blender pitcher in the fridge; I didn't strain the mixture (the Vita-Mix pretty much obliterated the seeds anyway); and I poured straight from the blender, 'cause that's just how I roll. Mmm.

I made exactly as written.  Would only rate it  as written.  Never changed a thing and everybody (including me) loved, loved.  If you change anything it's a different recipe.

Delicious!!  I've been making the regular beer margaritas on this site, but this is my new favorite - I love strawberries!  So simple to mix up.  If you mix up the strawberries and tequila in a Vitamix, there's no need to strain it for seeds - even simpler!  I did decrease the tequila to 8 oz, because I don't like it quite as strong, and then added 4 oz of water - perfect strength for me.  For the beer, all I had on hand was Budweiser and that worked just fine.  I will definitely be making this again!

beware!  these go down really easily.  Made them at a ladies weekend during Strawberry season and they were a great hit.  You need a crowd to consume 10 oz of vodka.
