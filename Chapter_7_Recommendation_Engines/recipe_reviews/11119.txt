We made these for christmas last year.  They roll out so easy my 2 year old play-doh expert even got to help.  We know make them for all the holidays.  They are eaten as fast as we make them.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Just the right amount of spice and not too sweet like regular sugary cookies. Gut gemacht!

I have made these two years in a row!  I love them!  Kids love them, many varieties can be done once they are out of the oven!

I made these last year at Christmas from a Betty Crocker cookie book ( 1970"s )  my Mother in Law gave me.I was looking for something other than the some ones I always make.  These  are so very good. My grand daughter was eating the dough and loved it.I used frestly grated nutmeg in mine.  These are simple to make and could be made without the nuts if you don't like them.

I made this again after trying it last year.  Both times it was wonderful.  I rolled mine in finely chopped nuts.  They are delicious and so very easy to make.  Thank you!!!

My favorite!!! If you're curious what they taste like, it's basically like a sugar cookie with a hint of spice. Absolutely delicious! I like to sprinkle red and green sugar crystals on top for color (and an extra sugar buzzzzzzzzzz!)

These are delicious.  Very crunchy and very flavourful!  I sprinkled them with sugar right before baking and they turned out delicious

Spices are delicious and the cookie is not overly sweet. We'll make again and again!

These are not what Germans call Zimtsterne. They are made with almonds and egg whites.
