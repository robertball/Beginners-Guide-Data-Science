This cheese ball is great IF you really LOVE black olives.  We do not, so I made it the 2nd time with about 1/4 the bl. olives originally called for and it was great!  I will leave the olives out all together next time.

I have used this recipe for years.  Like to take it to parties, gathers at work, church and family get togethers.  Everyone likes it and someone always ask for a copy of the recipe.  Thanks Julie, you gave me this recipe.
