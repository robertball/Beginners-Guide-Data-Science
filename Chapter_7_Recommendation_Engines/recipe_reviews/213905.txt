Double the macaroni and used half the curry powder then this might be a descent dish.  I am a macaroni salad expert, and i was not impressed with this recipe.  The curry powder was so strong, and I like curry so it wasn't that....trust me use very little, or don't use it at all!

I have made this recipie several times now I really love it. The so called "potato salad experts" that give this a poor rating have obviously never had a plate lunch Hawaiian style on the Hawaiian islands.

Yes, Correction, The curry was meant to be 1-1/2 teaspoon NOT in TBS...that was an error..Soli (Sorry)! It usually is more macaroni in most recipes but our family likes more potato than macaroni! Like was in the intro "to each his own potato mac salad!"

This is a wonderful basic recipe. I used less potato and more macaroni, and less curry. I left out the peas, too because I didn't have any, but you can use whatever amounts or combination you like, and it will be good. I served this next to huli huli chicken, oven kalua pork (both from this recipe site)and plenty of steamed rice, and my guests were transported to Oahu.

This was awesome! Other than celery salt in place of celery seed and apple cider vinegar in place of sherry, it was made according to the recipe. I will definitely make this again. I couldn't even wait until it sat over night. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great side dish for my Hawaiian-themed dinner. I made few changes due to personal taste and available ingredients: I skipped the peas (not a fan), used minced fresh celery (~1 tsp) instead of celery seed, and used gluten-free pasta (which can't be rinsed and should be added while slightly warm). Also, I used Malaysian curry powder and a dash of paprika to spice it up. So Good! Thank you!

Love it. Can't wait until our next pot luck at work because this is what I'm bringing.  Used fresh eggs from the hens of our neighbor, made my own mayo. Just a note, I've made this twice and it seems a good carrot shredded is a must! It's a keeper in rotation for the summer. Thank you for the recipe. Aloha

I liked it and did adjust the curry powder down as suggested by others. Next time I make it I will decrease the potatoes and increase the macaroni. Personal preference. I followed the instructions for the eggs exactly and they came out perfect!  I also added chopped celery for a little crunch. The peas and carrots add color and flavor. I will make this again!

Spectacular!  I am not one for egg salads or potato salads, generally, but the dressing was really delicious and I highly recommend this recipe.  LOVED the macaroni in it and the curry and cilantro flavors.  I will definitely make this again!!  (Reduced the amount of curry, as per the other reviewers).

After just being on Maui & having had this amazing dish a time or two (many!), I had high hopes when I found this recipe, but am somewhat disappointed. This isn’t at all the “traditional” way the locals make it. My review is based off of the original recipe posted- something is very off and it starts with the curry powder. I love curry, but there is WAY too much in this. It is entirely overwhelming, to where that is all you can smell or really taste. I feel like it almost ruined it. And, the amount of macaroni is scarce. The traditional version has a slight sweetness to it, but the perfect amount of tang. This didn’t have either. I ended up doctoring the entire thing, because it just didn’t taste good as written. To salvage: add in 1 more boiled egg. Increase macaroni to double. Substitute 1/2 of the curry powder with garlic powder. Make SURE you use sweet onion. Double amount of sherry. Use Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Then, I added in 2-3 Tablespoons of yellow mustard and some diced cheddar cheese to soak up some of the overdone curry powder. It made it decent, with the additions & doctoring. But, if you are looking for the traditional, popular version, this isn’t it.

TRUE AUTHENTIC TASTE! If you are having a pot luck then make this the night before and allow for the flavors to marinate. The curry is the right amount of flavoring. Probably my favorite potato salad recipe!

I made this for our luau bbq and it was a huge hit- I did use apple cider vinegar instead of sherry and I do the curry, salt and pepper to taste but other than that I follow it to the spot and it’s great! Since I made it I’ve been asked to make it a few times over !

Basically halved the recipe because as listed it makes 20 servings.  Only used three potatoes and four eggs but all the pasta. Used salad macaroni and about 2/3 of a Sweet Vidalia Onion.  I thought it was about right but wife said it was a little heavy on the onion.  Used a full Tbsp. curry powder but there was no hint of curry in the salad.  Sliced the potatoes into 1/2” slices before cooking so I could better control the texture; then diced them into 1/2” cubes with a dicer.  I’ll make this again.  Next time I’ll use more curry.

We love this Bruddah's mac potato salad! No changes, no additions or deletions, made as written except for scaling down to 4 servings for the 2 of us. Do try this recipe for a new twist on potato mac salad!

Great tasting salad. I don't add the peas and double the macaroni. It's been a favorite at the potlucks.  I've been told that some of the varieties had tuna in it but haven't tried it yet.

This is "broke da mouth" great potato salad. I made if for a party dinner last night and it was a hit. Everybody asked abut the one ingredient they could not identify easily, curry powder. I also made a second serving with sliced olives in it, which was applauded as well. Thanks Tui, I enjoyed 3 scoop Bruddah Potato Mac Salad, and more today with leftovers. Oh, I did expand the elbow noodles to 2 cups since we were feeding 12, and that worked out great. Mahalo for dakine ono grinds Bruddah Tui. Kaweka.

This is delicious! It was a big hit at a work potluck. I skipped the sherry vinegar because I didn't have it so I don't know how that would have changed it. My husband doesn't typically like curry, but he loved this. Will definitely make again. Well done.

I halved the recipe and it was amazing. Half made enough for 6 good sized servings for me. I didn’t have celery seed so I used cumin seeds. I thought the amount of curry was great. Made kalua slow cooker pork and Hawaiian sweet bread.

Just made this recipe.  In a word--Awesome!  Made a half recipe and followed it  except for a couple of things I didn't have--substituted white wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar and since I didn't have any celery seeds, added 1 chopped rib of celery and 1/4 tsp. of celery salt  for the salt.   Oh, yeah, upped the pasta to 1 cup--used medium shells, no elbows on hand; reduced mayo by 1/4 c., tossed in peas still frozen. Tastes great freshly made; but  I can't wait to taste it tomorrow after all the flavors have had a chance to meld together.  Will definitely make again many times and am eager to serve with several Hawaiian dishes for a wonderful meal.  Excellent, Bruddah!  Couldn't wait to make it since the moment I read the recipe.  Aloha from California!  Update:  Only been in the fridge about 1-1/2 hours, already scarfed about half of it.  Hurry up tomorrow or there won't be any left to eat.

This reminds me of Hawaii.  Since I made a lot less, mine was slightly different, but still Hawaii.  Da Kine!

I make this to pair with my smoked brisket. It's a crowd pleaser every time. Very unique

Excellent salad. Never used curry before. I now know what I've been missing all my life...curry! I followed exactly but I did cut back on the curry from reading the reviews. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks Tuihalalalala. Made our meal perfect.

Made this recipe last night for dinner tonight, with a few changes based on what I had in the kitchen and personal preferences.  For starters I had no macaroni, so it was all potato.  Nor did I have celery seed, so I had to use celery salt instead and omitted the salt to taste.  Made the recipe otherwise as listed (including the curry correction) and it was just a little bland.  So I added a little extra seasonings, and added garlic powder as well.  Also, added some sweet pickles and juice.  Tonight it was delicious!! My husband rarely likes potato salad and had two giant helpings- so you know it was good!
