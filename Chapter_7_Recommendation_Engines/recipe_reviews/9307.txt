A nice light recipe, fruity and not too sweet. I used chopped almonds. I took it to work for a pot luck and it went fast.

This was good.  Not excellent though.  I probably won't make it again -- just wasn't what I was looking for!

I used honey instead of sugar, omitted the candied fruit, and used chopped dried pears to substitute for the raisins and candied fruit, and substituted sunflower seeds for the pine nuts.  I made my own glaze recipe, and decorated with seasonal cherries.  Delicious!
