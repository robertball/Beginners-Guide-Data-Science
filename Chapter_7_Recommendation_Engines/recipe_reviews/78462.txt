I accidentally bought pumpkin pie mix instead pureed pumpkin in a can and was looking for a recipe to use it in. This didn't call for the pumpkin pie mix either, but figured it would be fine because it was something sweet. I used 1/2 the fat ice cream and low fat evaporated milk. I subtituted the cinnamon for an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice to get more of that pumpkin pie flavor. After I blended it I thought this tasted okay, but it was almost room temperature and only slightly thicker than milk. I then decided to add ice cubes like I do to every smoothie recipe on here. I added 8 ice cubes and it completely transformed it. It stretched the servings and it tasted like a pumpkin pie ice cream shake. "The ice is a must!" I don't think of ice cream in the fall but it was still tasty.

I used this recipe - a little less milk and added even more pumpkin spice to the mix. It was great!

Added almost double the pumpkin and used real whole milk since I didn't want to open a can of evap milk for just this.  Added some allspice when blending.  Just ok, but we all still slurped them down.  Nice fall treat.

I was trying to duplicate Dairy Queen's pumpkin pie blizzard during the fall. I knew cinnamon wasnt going to cut it so I added 2tsp of pumpkin spice blend. DQ has pie crust peices in their blizzard so I added grahmn cracker. I also used low fat milk instead of evaporated, I dont like that stuff. Overall, my shake was very good for a homeade treat!

I love almost anything pumpkin but I wasn't so sure about this recipe. I had two scoops of vanilla ice cream left in the freezer along with an opened can of pumpkin and evaporated milk so I decided to give this a try. It is very liquidy, but I actually really liked this recipe. It is not for everyone. I added extra cinnamon, allspice, cardmom, and whipped cream!

The taste was good but I added twice the ice cream and a little more pumpkin to get the correct consistency.
