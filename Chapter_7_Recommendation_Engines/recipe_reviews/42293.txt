Absolutely easy. I used nonfat milk and eliminated the ice cubes because the berries were frozen. I did throw in one frozen banana because I wanted to thicken it up just a bit. This was just enough for my two boys to have a smoothie and a good way to use last summer's fruits in my deep freeze. This would be good with any mixture of berries you had on hand.

This recipe is simply marvellous!!  My sister added yogurt to it and left the ice out.  It was better that way.  This is highly recommended!  They look as good as they taste!

Simple and delicious - not to mention very refreshing especially if you use fresh berries! I used only 2 Tbsp. of sugar and since I froze my fresh berries I cut back on the ice a bit, this way I could control the thickness. Overall, a very tasty treat!

I was looking for a smoothie without yogurt (yogurt is a migraine trigger and I am avoiding it.)  This is great!  My kids love it too, and were disappointed to not be able to have seconds when it was gone.  I used strawberries and cherries for the fruit (raspberries are a migraine trigger too!)

I thought that this recipie was really good.  However, I thik it would be better witha little less yogert.  Instead of using 1 cup of rassberries and then a cup of strawberries, I used about two cups of mixed berries.  Overall, I thought it was really worth trying.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this! What's not to like with simply fresh, sweetened berries and milk? Unlike others, I didn't find this too thick at all, but I guess it might just be a matter of how many ice cubes you add, or maybe the fact I used fresh rather than frozen berries? I substituted artificial sweetener for the sugar, using only 2 T. and for us it was the perfect sweetness. Light, healthy, and refreshing!

My daughter loved this as her after school snack. I scaled this down to 1 serving, used 1/2c. milk, 2/3c frozen mixed berries and used honey to sweeten instead of the sugar. Tasty!

This is an okay starting point if you've never found a good smoothie recipe, however, it is entirely too thick as per the directions and tastes like pureed fruit with milk in it.  My 7 year old didn't really like it.  By the time we got it to tasting okay, we had added another cup of milk, a cup of orange juice, and another cup and a half of fruit.

I had washed, hulled, and frozen a pint of strawberries and had been wondering what to do with them. I didn't want to run out and buy yogurt and I dislike the bananas that seem to be in every other recipe. Then I found this. Thank you! I didn't need the ice cubes and I used low fat milk. I thought it was perfect. My daughter thought it was tart. I toned hers down with a couple of drops of vanilla extract. There was a lot left over; I put a lid on it and put it back in the freezer and enjoyed eating it with a spoon the next day, like sorbet.

REALLY good. This was very thick, so I chopped up the ice first in the blender, and then added everything else. Also I used frozen berries and defrosted them before hand.

I really liked this smoothie. My berries were not very sweet, so I added 1 T honey, which wasn't enough so I added some splenda too. My berries were frozen in individual bags (from a friends farm) so they were plenty juicy which was perfect! So yummy and healthy and fat free, too!

As someone mentioned before, this is a good starting point if you don't have a smoothie recipe yet. However, it's definitely too thick. I added two and a half cups of milk instead of one in order to have it at a drinkable consistency. Otherwise, grab a spoon.

Also, you can mix and match what kind of berries you use in this recipe. I like using mixed berries instead of strawberries.

The first time I used this recipe, I added the sugar but it wasn't necessary. It is fine to leave out the sugar because its sweet enough, because of the sugars from the fruits. Overall, a good recipe you can play around with && change fruits around and it will still satisfy your taste buds. Excellent.

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was delicious and so easy to make.  I didn't add sugar because the fresh strawberries and banana added enough sweetness for me.  Instead of using 1 cup of each item, I used 1/2 cup of each ingredient so the smoothie would fit in my cup.  Will be making this again for sure.

I made this smoothie for my son yesterday after school. He really enjoyed the taste (we both did!) but it was VERY thick... I had trouble mixing it in the blender, which would have been helped by thawing the berries a bit. Also, I think it would have been better with yogurt or something creamy. Still tasted great-- just need to tweak the texture a bit!

This is simple, but pretty delicious. I would have added a banana to make it a bit thicker, but I appreciated a recipe without yogurt. I didn't add much sugar or ice to keep it smoother.

I love this smoothie!  It makes a great quick and easy breakfast.  I substitute a frozen banana for the ice cubes.  Just peel and chop a banana, put in in a ziplock bag, and throw it in the freezer the night before.  I currently have multiple bananas in the freezer, for whenever I feel like making these.  The banana gives it an extra kick, and really enhances the texture.  You can use any frozen fruit in place of the raspberries and strawberries.  A dollop of whipped cream on top is always a pleasant addition.  Will continue to use this recipe for years to come!

Nice and tasty combination. I modified the recipe, substituting half of the milk for nonfat vanilla yogurt, only using a couple ice cubes, and instead of sugar, half of a banana.

This is so delicious.  I modified, to my own personal taste preference, and it was so good.  I used Vanilla Soy milk instead of plain milk (and I used more than called for because it was too thick for my liking) and I only used 1 cup of mixed berries, rather than the 2 cups called for.  It was so yummy!  Love this and will make again..and again!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

i recommend substituting orange juice for milk, leaving out the ice cube if your already using frozen berries and use honey instead of sugar.  They are good both ways but i prefer this way.

This is an easy and delicious drink that is perfect on a hot summer’s day.  I substituted blackberries for the raspberries because that’s what I had on hand and eliminated the sugar just to make it a little healthier.  In addition, because my fruit was frozen, I didn’t bother with the ice cubes and increased the milk so it would mix in the blender.   This is a great simple drink recipe.

I've been experimenting with smoothies and this one came out perfect!!  I actually used all strawberries (no raspberries), almond milk, and added a scoop of whey protein.  I adjusted the amount of milk to get it to the consistency I liked.  YUMMY!

Delicious!  I used frozen berries, and it took about 1 and 1/3 cups of milk to get the proper consistency.  Only complaint was the brain freeze I got from gulping down those first couple of sips too quickly!

This was sooo good. I made it twice in one weekend. Following others advice I cut out the ice and used low fat yogurt. Having made a lot of smoothies in my time I think the ice thing is just more of a preference. If you like chunks of ice and something less milky then use ice, otheriwse you might want to try frozen or regular yogurt. Everything else I did the same.

Due to making additions I chose to rate this as a 4 but I would give it a 5, with the additions. i added 1/2 cup of yogurt and some flax seed (extra nutrition). Prior to adding the yogurt I found that there was not enough moisture (maybe because I used frozen peaches, pineapple, melon and berries) so I added more milk. Turned out great! Thank you

This is great. I have never found a homemade smoothie I like. My store had a bag of frozen mixed berrie: strawberry, raspberry, blueberries, and blackberries so I used that. It's abit sweet but I'll like that. Most smoothies come out milky. Will be making this very often, thanks.

It was absolutely delicious, but I used splenda instead of sugar. Also I made only one serving with 1/3 of everything except for the splenda/sugar. For the splenda I used 1 tablespoon.

Pretty good start to a smoothie but I had to doctor mine up to get it yummy. I used almond milk and 1% organic milk. I also added some honey flavored greek yogurt and a small handful of almonds. After all of that it was pretty tasty!

I give 4 stars because this *tastes* delicious. But there are a lot of chunks in it. and seeds. and i blended and blended and blended. i know our blender sucks even though it is brand new, but usually i am able to make a smoothie smooth by blending and blending. hmm this time it didn't seem to work though.

I used frozen medley of berries and skipped the ice.  Also, I used a teaspoon of honey instead of the sugar, and threw in a banana.  Turned out great!

Very good.  I opted to not add the ice since the berries were frozen.  The kids and husband got several brain freezes sucking these down so fast!

This was a little too thick for me, so I added more milk. Also I used yogurt instead of ice cubes, but it works well either way. Excellent recipe to start from though.

Made for and with 30 summer school students. The kids AlL loved it. The adults were pleased too. Wonderful kid friendly treat. Made exactly the way the directions said. It was a little thick but the kids loved it that way.

This is the easiest and quickest smoothie recipe ever, and it is the best!  All I had on hand was blackberries, so I used 2 cups of blackberries-it was perfect!

I personally love this recipe, though, i changed it a bit to appeal to my younger brother and sister. I added lemon juice, (Just about a quarter of a glass full) and the peels of two lemon slices, a bit of leftover salad, and, instead of milk, i used some of the gross yogurt we're trying to get rid of. With smoothies, you can put practically anything and you won't taste it half the time! Anyway, the smoothie tastes great as is, but even better if you make some compromises, or just plain use what you can!  Thanks for the recipe, TootstheRoll :)

I was looking for a healthy snack or dessert. I'm trying to cut the ick out of my diet. This was perfect!! I used honey instead of sugar as well and it was AWESOME! It is a bit thick, but that's easily remedied for those who don't like their smoothies that way.

Five stars from the kids. I would say more like 4 stars. I think they need something a bit more sweeter added to them, like apple juice or honey. They are thick, so I found it easier to chop the ice with a bit of milk first. Then add everything else.

This smoothie has little added sugar and may not even need it depending on your fruit.  I used a berry blend of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries.  It was a little thick, but the whole family devoured my double batch in minutes.  We will make this healthy drink again soon!!!

I made this smoothie with frozen cherries and blackberries in place of the other fruits. The instructions should have said 'thaw the fruit', because this recipe was hard for my blender to handle.

Added a fresh banana and frozen mixed berries. I omitted the sugar, used water in place of milk and a little vanilla yogurt that I needed to use up. It was yummy, and a great base for adding your own ingredients. Thanks

Fantastic basic smoothie recipe!  I was looking for a smoothie recipe to use my skim milk with instead of yogurt for the base.  I wanted something low-cal and if you add 3 T. of splenda instead of the sugar this fits the bill perfectly! Thank you!

Very thick and filling.  I make single servings with half a cup of strawberries and a third a cup of blueberries.  I followed the advice of others and added a small container of plain non-fat yogurt as well as milk.  It didn't blow me away but it was quick, easy and tasty and when running to work in the morning, that's what's most important.

This smoothie is quick and so easy. It tastes amazing. I am one person so I made half of what the ingredents said and only added strawberries. For the sugar part i added 1 tablespoon instead of 3. I also used fresh strawberries to make it fresh

This recipe was great. I didn't have any strawberries on hand so I used blackberries along with the raspberries and substituted splenda for the sugar. It was a tasty treat that is very healthy and fits nicely in any weight watchers budget.

This was really good.  I did alter it a little, but the basic recipe is very tasty--a kid pleaser!
