Sorry, but after cutting, chopping, cooking in one pot and transferring to a casserole dish and baking for a long time, I expected alot more than this. The taste was o.k., but for the most part I could have gotten the same taste if I opened up a can of Spanish rice and added the kidney beans. Everyone in my family felt the same way. I will not be making this again. Sorry.

Sounds good, but red beans and rice is a Creole dish, not a Cajun dish. There is a very definite divverence, trust me.  I'm Cajun, but have Creole friends. And these people don't use kidney beans for red beans, they used small red beans.

This was a quick and easy meal. I used a boxed red beans and rice mix and stewed tomatoes. I skipped the oven and made this in a skillet on the stovetop.

My family loves this recipe. I have been making a similar version for years. The only difference in my recipe is after the casserole has baked, I add cheddar cheese and sliced green olives to the top and bake until melted.

This was O.K. but nothing special.  It needs some other spice but I'm not sure what.  Note about prep time:  It was closer to 30-35 minutes from the time I started prepping the vegetables until the dish went into the oven.
