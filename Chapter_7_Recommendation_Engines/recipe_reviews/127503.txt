When I read the part about the mix overflowing I should've taken that as a warning.  This was no little dribble like you might expect with pies...this was significant.  I'm sure the brownies taste good if more than half the mix doesn't run over the sides.  Next time I'll try it with a slightly larger pan...and yes, I did measure everything.

I had been craving brownies since going gluten-free a couple of weeks ago.  These are by far the best tasting I have tried, but they are a little sweet.  I made these just like the recipe says and used the Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free All-Purpose Baking Flour.  They were great and didn't last the evening.

This would be a great recipe if the pan size is correct.  Make sure you use a 9 x 12 at least.  What a mess and heed the warning about the cookie sheet under the pan.

Thank you for this recipe. My hubby is now gluten free but loves brownies and anything chocolate. I tasted the brownies myself and I even like them. Fudgy and not dry, thanks again! ** update= I had to leave town the next day so I was forced to freeze them, best thing is they are better now! Something about freezing them helped take away the little bit of grittiness there was. If you work with gluten free products you know what I mean. So, try freezing them when you have any leftovers so you really can enjoy later. I made a peanut butter frosting to go on top, yummy!

Very good.  We loved the fudgy taste with a pleasant texture not often found in GF baking.  Agree that a 9x13 pan is needed.  Due to egg/dairy food intolerances in our house, we used a egg substitute and a mix of applesauce/oil/water instead of the margarine.  I added enough liquid until it was of similar consistency to a non GF box mix.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

These brownies taste great.  I would say they are just as great as my favorite non-gluten-free brownie recipe.  They're rich, moist, and sweet.  I also added 1/4C vegetable oil, to ensure their moist-ness.  Also, like the previous reviewer stated, use a larger sized pan; I used a 8 1/2 x 11 pan and it was perfect / there was no spillage.

This was my first Gluten Free baking experience.  It turned out really well.  My friend that has the gluten allergy really enjoyed the brownies which was the goal, but I was surprised by how much everyone else loved them too.  I will definitely make these again!

Eh, these *tasted* okay, but they were soo super dry! I am going to take them and chunk them up, bake them and use them as  cookie crumb pie bottoms... I had to drink 2 huge glasses of water to wash these down. Pretty disappointed, since I am putting my kiddo back on the GF diet.

I have to children that have recently gone gluten free. I am an advid cooker and baker and found that everything I was making gluten free turned out dry and not so so great. These were amazing and we are a picky family with our food! I LOVED them! I did use a larger pan (11x13) and everything turned out excellent! I reduced the baking time to 30 minutes as I did use the larger pan making the brownies thinner. These are great and I highly recommend!

What I wrote to a friend about this recipe:
I have NEVER found a brownie recipe I liked so I have always used a box mix because those are good.
Ironically enough, after making a gf brownie from scratch yesterday I found the most delicious brownie recipe EVER! It's not perfect because it doesn't come out very beautiful and can make a mess in the oven but it is DELICIOUS!

I did not put aluminum foil underneath because it only filled half the pan but it really does grow to the point of overflowing (that's where it doesn't look that pretty in the end) so do put the aluminum foil underneath! After it was in the oven I thought "I wonder if I should have put some xanthum gum in there since my all purpose flour doesn't have any" but guess what! No xanthum gum needed! Very impressive, yet strange (due to the overflowing), recipe. Enjoy!

I would put 4 stars due to the overflowing and look of the brownies in the end but the taste overrules that and I have to put 5 stars!

You MUST use a 9x13 pan for these brownies.  Other than that, these brownies are FANTASTIC! I made them for a friend who is Celiac and this was my first time making them.  They came out delicious!! They do NOT even taste Gluten free! I followed the recipe exactly - you do not need to add or subtract anything.  They were rich, gooey and moist and absolutely delicious! They were not dry or hard.  I had no problems with them.  I baked them for 42 minutes.  The ends were a little crispy, but most brownies come out that way anyway.  I dusted mine with powdered sugar.  These are way better than any boxed brownie mix out there (gluten free or not).  I will be making these anytime I need brownies again!

I don't know what to compare to than "normal" brownies. Made for husband's co-worker who is can't tolerate Gluten. I read reviews, but then modified some: I melted margarine on stove-top on med-high heat, added 1/4 oil and 1/4 water. Added cocoa to pan. Then I mixed with dry ingredients; added eggs then baked in 9x13 cake pan. No spills! Taste great!

LOVED this recipe. I did change a few things though. I add 1/2 C canola oil as recommended in another review. Also,I didn't have any of the flour mixture, I just used fresh rice flour that I ground. I baked it in a 9x13 pan (it filled it nicely - thanks for the tip!) for 38 min. Once cooled I frosted it with a Betty Crocker Cream Cheese frosting. It was delicious! The texture was great and everyone ate them up!  (side note about the texture: I used my Bosch and beat the dry ingredients for 3-4 min on high speed. After adding remaining ingredients I mixed it all for another 3-4 min on high speed. I think this helped get rid of the gritty texture.) The brownies were moist and YUMMY and you couldn't even tell they were Gluten Free!

Yummy!  I've made this a couple different ways.  Husbands favorite is with Andy's mint chips in the brownies and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I've also made it with mini semi sweet choc chips in the brownies and a layer of cream cheese filling on top.  I baked the brownies for 25-30 mins prior to add the cream cheese layer.  Cream cheese recipes is: 2 packages of CC, 1 egg, tsp vanilla, and 1/2 C Sugar.  After adding CC layer bake another 25-30 mins until appears set.  YUM!  My new favorite guten free brownie!  **PS:  Be sure to bake in a 9X13 pan.  The recipes is incorrect!**

Pretty darn tasty! I made these in a bigger pan, as suggested. I also didn't have enough cornstarch, so I used 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup arrowroot. I also added a dash of salt and vanilla. And I melted the butter (I'm not a fan of margarine) on the stove with the sugars before mixing it all together, to help with graininess. These brownies are easy to make and have an excellent texture! I will definitely make these next time I have a chocolate craving.

DEAR ELSIE91 - I am the author of this recipe and have read your question about the baking flour mixture. I can understand your confusion. However, the GF flour mixture in the video is exactly the one you should use for the recipe. I am not sure why the wording is altered to say "baking mix" but you can be confident that this is referring to Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour in the red package. 
ALSO - Several cooks have had better luck with using a larger pan, and that's something you might consider. Blessings to you, Sheila

My children run and hide when I announce "this is GF".  These looked so luscious that agreed to try.  Then everyone demanded that I make them again.

cooks tip:  I used a home-made GF flour mix and thinned the batter with 3/4c vanilla rice milk.  Like all GF recipes, let batter rest for 10 - 15 minutes before baking.

Had no chocolate chips, so was glad to find this recipe that used cocoa instead.  These were super dry! They also baked faster than the time shown on the recipe.  Really disappointed with the outcome.  Will stick to my usual GF brownie recipe.

Made these for my gluten free significant other tonight. She absolutely loves them, I used a 9X13 pan, added 1/2C semi sweet chocolate chips and baked them about 7 minutes too long. They turned out a lil crunchy on top, and nice and gooey in the middle.

Fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing it.

This one must have been good...I ate about a quarter of it out of the pan straight away...yikes. However, I think it was a tad over cooked. The top was really hard and when I tested it with a fork it caved in. I used the larger pan and used the lower cooking time of 40 minutes, so maybe next time reduce the time even more. You would never know they were GF!

Hard as rocks but taste yummy! This batter was way too try. More like chocolate cookie batter.  It is definitely missing some liquid. I would make these again as drop cookies.

These turned out pretty fantastic.  Made them for an upcoming fundraiser at my old high school.  My mom, who has never found a gluten free product she could stand, couldn't tell the difference.  SUCCESS.

As other reviewers say, use a 9x12 pan at least.

Made this recipe with applesauce and it was a delicious low-fat GF treat. Also used larger pan, thanks to previous reviewers.

Great flavour and consistency. My first gf baking experience.. I baked them about 5 minutes too long- I was waiting for the inevitable sinking and waited a touch long! lol  Great recipe though!

I followed the recipe exactly and what happened was the the top 1/3 rose significantly and turned out to be rock-solid, while the middle was barely even set and the bottom was about perfect.  I ended up peeling off the top 1/3 and throwing it away, baked the rest for another 20-25 minutes and ended up with some good-tasting brownies that looked kind of funny.

These were fantastic!  I did make a few alterations to the recipe, the first being the pan size (9x13) and the cooking time (30 min).  I reduced both the white and brown sugars to 3/4 cup each.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon.

Followed advice of others using the 9 x 13 pan.  It was weird...it raised a lot around the edges, and sunk in the middle.  Made for a very thin, crumby brownie.  Taste was ok, but don't think I will make again :(

I made these exactly as written, but put them in a 9 x 12 pan.  Baked them till they tested done.  Once they had cooled, I tipped them out of the pan and they were hard as a rock.  I couldn't even cut them with a very sharp knife.  I will not be making this recipe again.

a friend's daughter is allergic to eggs and butter so i did some substitutions. i did about 4 tbsp banana for eggs and 3/4 c oil for margarine and i used regular white flour. i dont know if my exchanges were significant enough to affect the brownies but it wasnt what i was expecting. they took a long time to bake. they were also a little hard and sunk a ton in the middle but puffed on the sides so you couldnt really cut them out. i cant give it low stars due to my substitutions and the fact that they actually tasted great but the "brownie look" was way off. any advice on substitutions are welcome!

Really great brownies.  Made them for my book club.  Served regular and gluten free and crowd liked gluten free better.  I would love to know how you make the frosting in the picture.  Looks really tasty.

The 40 minute minimum baking time was was too long and I over baked them.  The part of the finished product that was edible tasted great. I'll make them again, but watch the baking time a lot closer.

The batter was quite gross, which worried me, but thankfully the actually thing turned out really great!  It was a bit more cake-consistency than brownie, but that could be because I tinkered with the recipe a bit.  I also added chopped up strawberries, which was delicious!

I didn't have as good of luck as others.  Mine raised with an air pocket in the middle, the top was hard.  So hard, that my toothpick didn't go in to it.  Yes, I have checked the temp of my oven and the cooking time.

These turned out pretty good even with some substitutions and adjustments. I wanted to bake something but had very little white flour (I don't tend to bake GF). I cobbled together about a half cup AP flour, and used tapioca flour and oat flour to come up with the appropriate remaining amount. I also only used 1/2 cup of white sugar, and added 4 packets of Truvia. I then baked them in a foil lined muffin pan for about 16 minutes. The result was a little dry, but had great chocolate flavor, and I won't knock the rating due to making changes.

I used soy flour instead of a baking flour. I also added vegetable oil, about 1/4 cup. I also microwaved one tablespoon of peanut butter and drizzled it over the brownies! It was amazing! My daughter just became a celiac and I wanted to make her something that was yummy and didn't taste any different than regular brownies. :)

I used a 7x11 pan, and it also was too small.  Definitely use a 13x9 pan and cook a little less.  Also, I accidentally bought Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  What a hit.  EVERYONE loved it, even those not needing the gluten-free.  It was gone in one afternoon.

Thank you for this G.F. recipe.  Of all the baking items a G.F. diet doesn't permit, we miss brownies the most.  This is a good recipe.  Thank you for the extra advice.  The feedback given by contributors is so helpful and helps me select the best recipes.

I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  They taste 5 star, really delicious.  BUT....they didn't look done so I baked them a tad longer.  When cooled down, we couldn't put a knife through them, hard as brittle. (My fault).  So a warning to any future bakers, don't over bake.  I chipped off a few pieces a little at a time and blended them into fine grains and froze them.  My hubby loves them over ice cream!  One last thought, I did bake them in a 9 x 13 pan, please cut down the baking time when using a larger pan.

I'm the baker in my family, so I make all the desserts for any gathering.  Our family has several food allergies, including gluten.  I have made these 3 times.  I'm not a huge fan of gluten free baking.  But, these are very good, I can't find a thing wrong with these, I make them exactly as written. I added an extra egg last time to make them more cake like for a trifle and they were fantastic. *I do substitute the margarine for butter, I never use margarine.

Smell great; rise up more than I'm used to seeing, and required more time. I believe the brown sugar is the main culprit. In a family recipe, called blonde brownies, we have to baby the cooking like this.

Best brownies ever. Tried shop bought ones and were dry and tasteless. There were moist and tasty a little in sweet side but then one is just enough to satisfy chocolate cravings. Will make again.

This was my first attempt at baking a gluten free recipe and I made this recipe for a couple of our Board members (one has celiac and one was just cutting gluten from his diet) for a Board meeting luncheon and they loved it and so did the non-gluten free members.  Just thinking about how confident I was to have made these for the first time and for a Board meeting non the less!   I doubled this recipe as is and put the aluminum foil underneath in case of overflow and it was fine. While it cools it does sink.  They were fudgy , chocolatey and had a nice little crust on top.   One of our Board members said they were the best gluten free brownies  that he has ever had and has asked me to share this recipe!  I will definitely make these again even though I do not have celiac.

Great taste. I added chocolate chips (making a sweet recipe even sweeter). My kids loved them. I used a 9x12 pan and had no problem with overflowing.

Made for gluten sensitive friends. Delicious & enjoyed by all! A "keeper" of a recipe. As suggested, made it in a 9x13 pan. Baked for 40 min. Would reduce to 35 min the next time. (And there will be a next time!)

Made it with 1/3 c Bob's gluten free blend & 1/3 c Purely Bulk GF all p flour.  Used butter, instead of margarine and dissolved b soda in a little water.  Haved the sugar...1/2 c xylitol & 1/2 c coconut palm.  Seems sweet enough.
This did not rise and spill over like others said.
Ended up very dry and felt apart when warm.  Put it into the freezer and keeps together better, but still very dry....maybe other flour?
Very good flavour though.

I cooked it for the shortest time,  and the edged of the brownie were so hard it was inedible.  I cut the center out so it wasn't a total loss. The flavor was fine, but I like a moister brownie. Maybe some vegetable oil would've helped to add moisture.

These were a hot mess when they were baking and I was worried about them, however the end result turned out very well.

First, the crusty, baked areas (edges, top crust) tasted good! However, like several other comments, very wet,soggy in the center. I live at high altitude so that may have something to do with it.  I didn't add the extra flour that normally I would. I have baked GF succesfully (breads) so I know it's possible.  I may try again and readjust measurements. I would have given 2 1/2 stars if able

Whatever you do, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT put these in muffin tins! :) The flavor was there, and I could tell that if properly baked, these should be quite tasty. Some of the middles of the brownies were still soft, and delicious, but the outsides would survive a large boulder falling on them. Thankfully, I have some batter left over, and will try to make drop cookies out of them, as another suggested, since I feel the texture was cookie - like. Good luck!
