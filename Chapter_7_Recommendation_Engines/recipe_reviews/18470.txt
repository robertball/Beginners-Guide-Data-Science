Very Yummy and Rich! The longer you leave pie in the freezer the easier it is to serve and eat. I made this for my daughter who wanted a pie for her birthday dinner party and it was a hit. I followed the recipe exactly but also added in some chunks of banana. It was great and I will be making this again but when I do I will let it sit in the freezer for longer then the two hours that I did this time.

So easy and very yummy! I used Chocolate Moosetracks ice cream and more peanut butter. Also, the more frozen, the better.

I've made this pie for years.  It's my son's favorite birthday dessert.  I usually swirl the peanut butter in,using natural peanut butter.  I also use a chocolate cookie crust with a layer of fudge sause, and then the ice cream.  Freeze after each step.

This pie is incredible!! I found that it's much better if you let it freeze real hard overnight. Next time I'm going to put a layer of sliced bananas on the bottom....move over Elvis!!!

Delicious!  Very rich!  For the chocoholics, drizzle hot fudge over it.

This was VERY yummy and easy to make.  I used a chocolate crumb crust, chocolate frozen yogurt and reduced fat peanut butter to reduce some of the calories. I softened the frozen yogurt in the micro a little to help make mixing with the peanut butter easier.

Too rich for our tastes, could really cut down on the peanut butter.

This is a good base recipe, but by itself is a little too rich and not quite what I was expecting it to be. It WAS delicious, but I could barely get through a single slice! I would recommend less peanut butter, and maybe using an ice cream with fudge pieces or the like.
