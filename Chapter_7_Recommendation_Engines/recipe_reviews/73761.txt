This is SOOOO good and easy! However, do yourself a favor. First, transfer your popcorn into a blow and then to another, leaving all of the unpoped kernels at the bottom of the first bowl. Toss the unpoped kernels. Return popcorn to bowl. This takes less than a minute and saves you a lot of time later (you don't have to find the unpoped kernels stuck in caramel!) When my caramel mixture was ready, I poured it unto the popcorn and tossed the caramel eavenly in the bowl to make sure the popcorn got evenly coated. Then, I transfered the coated popcorn into the brown paper bag. Depending on your microwave, it might be smart to cook it only 30 sec. at a time or to reduce the power because the first time I made it it burned. I cooked mine for 1:30 minutes (30 sec. at a time) at a reduced 50% power and it turned out perfectly.
Note: For dairy-free version, replace the butter with 1/2 cup of Safflower oil.

Another tip.  Spray the inside of your paper bag with Pam cooking spray before adding the popcorn.  It helps keep the caramel from sticking to the bag.

Awesome!  Didn't read all reviews first and burned the caramel in my first attempt - so pay attention to the cooking time (it's only a few minutes after all : ) ).  The second time I cooked the caramel sauce for 1.5 minutes, stirred than another 1.5 minutes then added the baking soda.  When I re-microwaved it I only did 45 seconds per side and it turned out perfectly! Also as with other reviewers, I halved the recipe and used one bag of microwave popcorn.  Delish.

warning....do not make if you are looking for a little something to satisfy your sweet tooth...because you will eat way tooo much of this stuff. the beauty of this treat is how quickly it comes together and then wow.....pure delight to the taste buds. i had no trouble with preparing...only trouble is it is way addicting!!!  before my husband and i knew it we had polished off the whole bowl. i will definately make again but not often...too fattening and too good.

First of all, this popcorn turned out great.  It was easy to make, and the cleanup was a snap.  I made this recipe using 2 bags of microwave popcorn.  The box said that each bag was 12 cups popped, but when I measured it after popping it, it was actually 8 cups per bag.  This made 2 bags perfect for this recipe (4 quarts exactly).  I did not have any paper bags to toss the popcorn in (who does anymore?), so I used the empty microwave popcorn bags instead!  Since they are made to fit 12 cups of popped popcorn, and they actually only popped 8, there was enough room in each bag to fit half of the caramel popcorn back into each one for the second part of the recipe.   The whole process was like this: pop the popcorn, pour both bags into a large bowl, dump it into another large bowl and remove the un-popped kernels from the bottom.  Split the popcorn in half (half in each bowl), cook the ingredients for the caramel as directed in the recipe, pour half of the caramel onto the popcorn in each bowl, mix the caramel into the popcorn using a couple of large spoons, pour each bowl of popcorn into its own empty microwave popcorn bag, and then microwave each popcorn bag individually as directed.  My microwave is high-powered, so I did 1 minute at 50% power, then shook the bag, then did another minute at 50% power.  It worked great!  Since microwave popcorn bags are wax-lined, the caramel didn't stick to them at all, and everything worked out great!

Ok, this is soooo good. I have made  caramel popcorn the "old fashioned" way many times. Never again. This was so easy and quick and tastes just as good (if not better) than traditional. Couple of notes though: First, real butter is so much better and worth the extra cost because you can really taste the difference. Second, my butter/brown sugar mix boiled over in the m/w and made a big sticky mess which I then had to put the bag on, so I suggest you put a plate under the bowl to catch any mess. Third, I used m/w popcorn, I just omitted the salt and ate some while the butter/sugar mix was cooking. My bag says that each bag makes 10 cups, so it's about 4 cups too much. I used two bags (most of two bags, anyway) Terrific recipe, LOVE IT. Thanks.

I didn't think I had any corn syrup, (I actually did) so I used honey.  It still tasted great.

it was soooooo good the second time. NOTE TO EVERYONE: THE BAKING SODA IS IMPORTANT!!! the first time i made this i didn't have baking soda so i didn't use it. and it was gross, the butter and karo syrup dont combine and it had oily karo syrup on the top. but luckily the second time i was smart and i did use it. ps: the caramel is a good ice cream topping!!!

At first, when I microwaved it for the first 1 minute and ten seconds, it smelt really good, and it was fine, then i microwaved it again (as said in the instructions) and that pretty much ruined it. It smelt burnt, although it didn't appear to be that way, and it never got evenly spread in the paper bag with the popcorn in it; I don't recommend this recipe OR just follow your intuition on when the caramel should be ready and find a different way to evenly coat the popcorn in the caramel.

I just ate a whole batch myself!  I did halve the recipe, but still, it's just way too good.  I used one bag of microwave popcorn which made 4 cups of popped corn, so I halved the caramel ingredients.  I was concerned about messing and burning, as other readers had mentioned, but none of that happened.  I pretty much followed the directions.  On putting the bag back in microwave I set the timer for 1 minute instead of 1 minute 10 seconds, twice, as called for.  Everything perfect.  Thank you for a great recipe, I'm sure I'll make this many times.

This was the easiest thing to make EVER!!  I am famous for messing up the "easy" recipes but this was so incredibly easy and holy cow, FAST!!  
I still used the microwave popcorn (Store Brand in Natural Light Flavor) and used 16 cups of popcorn (approx. 1 1/2 bags) and used real  unsalted butter (popcorn already had salt).  Make sure you don't fold your bag down too far and not leave enough room for the popcorn to shake around in.  Thank you for an amazing recipe.

I have been making this caramel popcorn for 30 years the old way.  Just tried it the microwave way and was utterly thrilled.  No more worrying about 'softball' stage or baking it too hot and burning some! Thanks and I loved it.

Like quite a few people, I was a tad skeptical about making this...well, I followed the recipe to the tee and it was AMAZING!!! Thank you for such a quick and easy recipe for a, normally, time consuming treat!

PERFECT!  Never felt compelled to review any recipe until now.  Economical, easy and delicious--a triple threat.  I used one cup of popcorn kernals popped in 1/4 cup increments in the microwave (see this site for microwave popcorn), used real butter and a combo of dark corn syrup and molasses.  Used the tupperware bowl hint with great success.  It was so easy to coat all of the popcorn by shaking the bowl.  Heated the popcorn mixture in 30 second increments (shaking in between) for a total of 2 minutes--no burning.  I have a 1100 watt microwave and used it at 100% power.  All the popcorn was evenly coated. OUTSTANDING!  Don't wait to try and you'll never have to toil over a caldron of boiling butter/sugar again. Thanks for sharing.

Thanks for the recipe (and the helpful reviews) everyone!  Here are my adaptations:  I picked out the unpopped kernels, then divided the popped corn into two large bowls.  When I made the syrup, I used salted butter, so I omitted the salt.  I used dark brown sugar, because that usually yields a better "caramell-y" flavor and color than using light brown sugar (more molasses left in!).   I also waited to add the vanilla until both the initial cooking times were done, since I know in many other recipes that the vanilla extract doesn't go in until after the heating process.   I divided and poured the syrup mixture over the popcorn while it was in the two bowls, so I could better distribute the caramel syrup evenly over the corn than it would have been if I'd done that in the paper bag. I sprayed the inside of the paper bag, as suggested, and the finished popcorn came out beautifully.  This turned out to be a great idea for a quick party appetizer because I could make in little time, with ingredients I had in my pantry.  I sampled it as it layed out to cool, and it tastes spectacular! Now the only work I have left is to stay away from it, so I have something to bring to the party besides a stomachache and a guilty look on my face!  :D  Yummy!

I doubled this one, as i like all pieces to be coated.  
I also use 8-9oz bag  of Hulless popcorn (or puffcorn, depending on what you call it ;-),  
1 cup of cheerios, and 
1c of peanuts (or pecans).  

After I dump the butter into my microwave dish, I generally take my very large tupperware bowl (make sure it fits in your microwave, and has a lid) and rub the butter wrappers on the inside of the bowl. Dump in the popcorn, cheerios, peanuts into that dish while the coating is in the microwave.  Once the coating (caramel) is done, simply pour it all over the popcorn, put the lid on and shake it up. Pop it back in the microwave (lid off ;-) for 1 minute, stir, then another minute.  I don't bother dumping it out on waxed paper or a cookie sheet to cool, i just leave it in the bowl, it doesn't really stick together that much. Once it's cool the lid can go back on it for storage. It generally does not last more than a day in our house.

Thank you for taking the time to sit down and submit this.  My daughter is on a very restrictive diet for autism, and she can eat this!  She's going to go crazy!!!  Thank you again, and keep submitting!  SECOND NOTE: I made this recipe again today and I have to comment again.  This time I cut the margarine down to only half a stick (1/4 c) to save on the fat and I used a 50/50 mix of brown sugar and Splenda (still totaling one cup) to save on calories...it was still awesome!  I was afraid the caramel mixture might not turn out right since I messed with the measurements, but it was still perfect!

Make sure you bring the caramel to a boil and let it become a bit thick!! If you don't you will end up with a gooey sticky mess that never hardens. Just watch it close and stir often to prevent burning. Also I think butter works much better than margarine. And do not forget the baking soda. It is key. Good recipe and great to send to school for kids parties!

This was scrumptous! I burned mine too on the first go round. Cook 30 seconds less in the microwave and make sure the caramel syrup goes on the popcorn evenly.

I love this recipe, I've made it so many times now.  I make it often when the kids have friends over or for our weekend getaways to the mountains, beach, etc.  So easy, so quick, fast clean up, and soooo good!  Everyone loves this popcorn-people assume that I bought it or did a very time consuming oven baking method.  It just doesn't get any easier than this!  I use 3 bags of popped butter flavor microwave popcorn and the only change I make is to reduce the amount of time I cook it in the bag to 45 seconds each time instead of 1 min 10 secs-my microwave probably runs hot but it would burn if I left it that long.  GREAT recipe!!

I usually make my popcorn in the oven and over the stove and it is a lot of effort. This worked out really well. I don't have an air popper so I put half a cup of kernels in a large glass bowl with a dish towel on top and microwaved for 4 minutes. I added pecans to my popcorn and made half of the caramel topping. I agree with others about your microwave, I did my caramel at 30 second intervals and it needed only 2 minutes. I also used butter instead of margarine and pancake syrup instead of corn syrup. I also accidentally put in baking powder, and then put in the baking soda since I knew it was supposed to get foamy. My messup didn't seem to affect the outcome. I then tossed it about in bowls and followed the re-microwave for 1:10 instructions. Unfortunately one of my bowls burned a little in the middle, so again, that was too long. It's crunchy, not chewy, which is fine with me for the amount of effort put in.

Wonderful and So VERY easy! I have always burned my carmel corn, but not this time. BUT as a side note, you do want to watch the heating time -- I think I cooked mine for 2.5 minutes the first time, 1.5 minutes second time, and about 1 minute the last time. And this stuff dries really REALLY quick, so soak your pans as soon as possible!

DING DING DING!!! WINNER, WINNER, I COULD EAT THIS FOR DINNER!!!  This is an EXCELLENT recipe for caramel corn.  I popped a heaping 1/2 cup of popcorn in 1/4 cup oil.  The only change I made was to use butter in place of margarine.  This was so easy and so good.  I made two batches in one weeked.  One batch basically fills a gallon zip lock bag.  We took ours to the circus and it was the perfect treat!!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, SUBGIRL!!

Yum! and so easy!
I didn't have corn syrup, so I read online to heat in a saucepan 1 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1/2 cup honey.
I had lots more than the 1/4 cup of syrup I needed, but the whole recipe came out perfect! I will definitely make this again!

This is yummy. The changes I made were: Used only 1/4 cup of butter because that's all I had; mixing/cooking the popcorn in a huge bowl because I had no paper bags and I added some chocolate chips because I'm a chocolate fiend. I followed everything else to the letter and it came out great!  :)

I substituted the margarine for extra virgin coconut oil. It added extra flavor -SO good! I also took the advise about the reduced cooking time. It "carmeled" up perfectly - delicious! It's cooling now and I can't stop eating it!

This was so easy and tasty!  I usually spend tons of money around the holidays buying those big metal tubs of popcorn, only to eat the caramel corn.  No more of those!  I needed something quick and yummy to take to our bible study tonight and this is going to be great.  Only took me a half hour to make two batches and it's all ingredients I have around the house!   Thank you!

Maybe I'm just used to how it comes out when you put it in the oven and make caramel corn the "old fashioned way", because this kind, just isn't great. I wanted something sweet and quick for the kids and this fit the bill, but the recipe didn't make it to the recipe box.  Next time I'll candy my popcorn the way I popped it-- without the microwave. BTW 4 quarts popped corn is about 1 C Kernels

This is a great recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and instead of using paper bags, I used a large Tupperware bowl. I poured the carmel mixture over the popcorn and then put the lid on the bowl. I left one side one side alittle open so the heat can come out. Shake the bowl until all the popcorn is covered with mixture. I then put the popcorn on a cookie sheet to harden up.

I must have done something wrong. The taste of the caramel was very good but I had a really hard time getting the popcorn coated. The paper bag didn't work well for me. Most of the popcorn stuck together in small balls and every now and then you will get a huge piece of hard caramel (not that that is a bad thing really.) We'd have huge dentist bills if we ate this that often. Thanks!

This is the best caramel corn popcorn ever!!! The popcorn is never sticky like a baked caramel corn. It practically melts in your mouth! I have been making this recipe for years. It is always the rave. I use even more popped popcorn. At least 6 quarts and every piece is covered. Be sure to shake vigorously after each microwaving. This cools and dries very quickly and there is little to no time before it can be served.

this is what I grew up making.  One recipe is sufficient for one air popper full of popcorn.  I believe there is plenty in a half a recipe for one air popper full - that's how we make it.

I did a half batch, so I shortened the cooking time.  I microwaved it for 1 1/2 minutes then stirred the caramel mixture, then cooked it for an additional minute.  Then I just poured it over the popcorn in a bowl and stirred it to coat (using greased hands once it had cooled a bit).  It was crunchy enough for me at this point, so I didn't cook it any more.  Yummy.

Every time I make this recipe, it comes out differently! That's not to say it's bad. It just takes a bit of tweaking. For instance, you could halve the recipe and have enough for the same amount of popcorn. Also, cut the microwave time down when you put the syrup over the popcorn in the bag, 45 seconds each side. Also, I think microwave popcorn without extra flavoring worked the best. I still use this recipe though. The taste is great, and the treat is quick to make!

While it was yummy it never fully set. I made this twice and the first batch was exactly as the directions said and the sugar mixture never reached the right point (or even boiling) to caramelize properly. The second time I increased the initial cook time by 1 1/2 minutes, no change. It still did not set.  I got the best results making the sugar mix on the stove and then transferring to a paper bag for coating. (Which spraying the inside of the bag with cooking oil helps a lot!)

This caramel corn is so easy to make and is super delicious and addicting.  I made it for the first time and took it to work for a potluck.  Everyone wanted the recipe and couldn't believe it was made in the microwave.  ***One little hint though--be sure to stir the baking soda into the corn syrup mixture really well.  This will help coat the popcorn alot better.

This was awesome.  I also used a bag of microwave popcorn and cut the caramel mix in half.  It worked great.  I found it didn't need as long in the microwave as the recipe stated, but that's not unusual, different microwaves mean different times/temperatures.  Just keep an eye on it.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Thank you for the great recipe!

LOVE this recipe, it's so quick and easy. After 4-5 times making it, I made a few changes: I used salted butter instead of margarine. I used 2 bags Orville Redenbacher Light popcorn. One minute instead of 1 mins 10 secs. After removing popcorn and shaking bag, I zap it another 30 secs-1 min for added crunch. SUPER!!! My first time making caramel corn-- my hubby and I ate a whole batch on Super Bowl Sunday, it's hard not to!

This recipe is great for simple, easy, and tasty!  This turns out just like the microwave caramel corn you can buy. 
The second time I made this I didn't have the paper bag, so I put another bowl on top and was able to distribute the caramel on even better than with the paper bag.  The first time I made this, I used twice the amount of  popcorn and it was nice with just a light taste of the caramel.  This is my favorite recipe for a simple and quick way to make caramel popcorn.  It will turn out gooey if you don't lay it out after shaking it at the end.  ENJOY!

I made this with pretzels because I had a bunch leftover. Mmmm these are good. But, if pretzels are used, omit the salt. I forgot the pretzels already had salt on them. But, still good. Great recipe!

I had this recipe over 15 years ago and lost it.  So nice to have it back.  It is a great recipe.  Important to have a large glass bowl in microwave so it will not bowl over.  Once it cools off, it is nice and wonderful caramel.  Great finding this receipe again. Judyanne.

This was really good and QUICK!!  I halfed the recipe.  I used one bag of microwaveable popcorn (with butter in it already).  I mixed everything together in the bowl and then added the popcorn to it and just stirred it up.  I also didn't cook as long each time.  I just watched it but I did make sure that the butter mixture was bubbling in the microwave before adding the baking soda and popcorn.  It turned out really good; just enough for two people.  Excellent and easy!!!  will use again.

I have making a recipe almost like this for over 30 years. Always spray Pam inside of the bag and add vanilla after microwaving the butter/ sugar mixture. I also transfer popped  popcorn to a Tupperware bowl with a mesh lid and "shake" out unpopped kernels and then to a brown paper bag.

So super-easy to make and so very delicious. The only thing I can recommend is to make it on a low-humidity day. Mine was slightly sticky as there are storms moving in and the humidity is as high as the temp today.

This is very bad but only for the figure! I made it and it turned out very yummy. I just used a bowl for mixing. Did not want to go the paper bag route. Next time I will only microwave it for 1 minute each time after adding the syrup. I made the syrup as per recipe. I will certainly make it again.

Don't make this!  It is TOO good, and TOO easy!  The hardest thing about it for me was finding a paper bag (since all the grocery stores are now using plastic!)  Enjoy!

YUM! Too bad for the diets here. We will treat ourselves often as this is so easy to make. Make sure you don't dump the caramel all in the middle of the popcorn in the bag. You have to get a big rubber spatula in the bag and stir it well to distribute the caramel or it will burn in the middle. After the 1 1/2 minutes stir it with the spatula again to mix it all well. Just shaking the back leaves it in clumps and it will burn. Love the simple way of doing this.

I made a half batch. I cooked the syrup for 1 minute, stirred, then three 30 second rounds, stirring between each round. I then added the vanilla extract and baking soda, heated it another 30 seconds and then added that to the popcorn. I only heated it an additional minute in the bag and it came out so light and crispy! My son (who never stops moving) actually sat down next to the bowl, stuffing his mouth. When I asked him if it was good, all he could do was mumbled "Mmmm-hmm!" through a mouthful. Great alternative to butter and salt!

This tastes good and is fun to make! My son and I make it together.  The coating isn't quite as even as when baked in the oven, but a small price to pay for the time savings.

1)microwave cooking time is way to long 2)do not atempt to heat back up in the bag , unless you want a messy burnt mess! Just mix in bowl then then spead on foil. 3) On a positive note  it really did turn to a very tasty carmel.  (before the yucky mess ) I will try again !

In a word...YUM!!!!!!  This was so quick, easy and delicious!  I make a regular batch to test and it was so good that I'm making several batches to hand out in goodie bags as favors for my Bunko Christmas Party this week.  Just to dress it up a bit, I will drizzle it with melted chocolate just after it sets.  Also, I used a Silpat mat rather than wax paper and it worked out GREAT!!!

A huge hit with kids!  I made this 2 days in a row for a bake sale.  Each time it sold out almost immediately with people requesting it the following days of the bake sale.  Super easy and yummy!  1 batch will give you about 6 sandwich sized bags full of popcorn.  

I read over all the recommendations and made the following helpful adjustments that others did: 
*Popped the popcorn and then put in to a different bowl to remove all the unpopped kernels.
*Sprayed the inside of the brown bag with a bit of cooking spray.
*Waited until the caramel was made before I put the popcorn in the bag.
*I've tried both light and dark brown sugar.  Only the color intensity changes.  I think I prefer the light brown sugar.  It makes the popcorn look fluffier...which I am sure is just my imagination...but I like the looks of it better. 
*Adding the baking soda at the end of microwaving the caramel is ESSENTIAL!  The consistency is completely different without it.  If you don't have it, just wait to make this until you have it.  You need it!
*Decreased the amount of cooking time in the microwave to 1 minute on each side.  If you like chewy caramel corn (rather than crisp, crunchy) then decrease the microwave time a bit.  This step is also essential.  I forgot it with one batch and had gooey, stick-to-your-teeth caramel corn. 
*I sprayed the wax paper with a SUPER LIGHT AMOUNT of cooking spray.  This kept me from eating wax paper when I removed the cooled popcorn.

Great recipe! I did make the caramel on the stove-top while I was popping the popcorn in a brown bag in the microwave. Then I added the caramel and microwaved it for the time the recipe says. It turned out so yummy, my hubby and I can't stop eating it!

Fun and easy! (I traded the margarine for butter--because, well, butter always tatstes better to me, especially when mixed with sugar--and it was inhaled by myself and three others within a half hour.

I wasn't sure what to expect. I always make stovetop caramel, and I didn't think the microwave was capable. Boy, was I wrong! This tasted amazing, and was really easy. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a bowl instead of a paper bag, and I checked the popcorn every 30 seconds, for a total of only 1 minute. It never had a chance to cool, as everybody ate it right away!

Fantastic. I love baked caramel corn but it takes so long, this is perfect!

It's now June 26 and I have made this countless times. Dark brown sugar definitely brings out more caramel flavor. For a double batch I use the cooking times stated and for a single I decrease it from 1 min 10 sec to 45 sec. 

I have been spraying my paper bag and tonight decided not to waste the wax paper, instead I put the bag on it's side, ripped it open, spread out the popcorn and let it cool right there! Perfect!

This was very good.  I think with a few tweaks it could be excellent.  First, use real butter.  Next, don't add the vanilla until just before you add the soda--otherwise it cooks out.  Also, next time I will use 1 tablespoon molasses and 3 tablespoons corn syrup for depth of flavor, as well as 1/4 teaspoon spices (ground cinnamon and cloves).  Finally, I will cut back on the popcorn so that the popcorn is well covered.

Easy and very yummy! I've never seen popcorn go so fast before! It was so good that I made it for my five-year-olds birthday party (a candy buffet) and was disappointed that there was very little left for me to much on!

I have been using a very similiar recipe for years, my only tip is to watch cooking times.  It will vary with different wattage microwaves.  This is a fast recipe and comes out with perfectly coated pieces every time!  I have used it for bake sales and preteen sleepovers with great success!

This is an excellent recipe.  Before transfering my air popped popcorn to my plastic bag for mixing, I coated the plastic bag with Pam so that it would not stick.  I also replaced the margarine with soy butter because my son has dairy allergies.

This is heavenly!  I did not have a paper bag so put it in a huge bowl and poured the carmel over top and mixed.  I microwaved it in the bowl, too and smiply stirred it in the bowl and did not cool on wax paper.  Much easier this way.  Be sure to shake out all the unpopped kernals before you add the carmel.  Wonderful!

Thank you this was fast, easy and delicious. My kids loved it. I just microwaved 1/2 cup of popcorn in a brown bag, took unpopped popcorns out. I didn't have corn syrup so I just substitute it with white sugar with dash of water but I got scared of sugar content while making, so I halved the brown sugar and used 2 T of margarine, filled rest of 1/2 C with light vanilla yogurt. It worked for us for now but next time, I might use 3/4 C brown sugar and see how it'll turn out.

I have made caramel popcorn the traditional way with great results but decided to try this recipe to save some time. Some microwaves have more power than others and I believe mine is really powerful because I felt like my caramel was ready after 3 minutes.  Unfortunately I followed the directions and cooked it for the additional 1 1/2 minutes, even though I was pretty sure that it was overcooked. I nuked the coated popcorn for 20 seconds, twice.  My popcorn was the color of Cracker Jacks but was not as tasty.  I ate some of it but not the rest.  I will make this again but use common sense as to when the caramel is ready.

I made this last night and it turned out perfectly. Some of the reviewers said theirs didn't turn out, and I think it depends on the microwave watts. Mine is also a convection oven, and is only 900 watts. I followed the instructions to a "tee" and it was perfect. It even hardened on after being turned out on waxed paper. Great recipe! Thanks!

This made me so sad... SAD THAT I DIDN'T FIND THE RECIPE SOONER!!! After reading other reviews I used three bags of microwave movie butter popcorn, sprayed the paper bag with cooking spray, and microwaved the caramel sauce for three minutes stirring every minute and then followed directions exactly just cutting microwave times by about 10 seconds. Remember... microwave times vary and I was using 1100 watts. This was so easy and so delish. It cooled to a perfect crispy caramel corn. Wasn't overly sweet, but use less popcorn if you want it sweeter. This was perfect and oh so buttery which made it even better. I need the calories, getting prepared for chemotherapy again. Thanks SUBGIRL!

1/2 cup unpopped kernels equals 4 quarts of popcorn in my air popper.  I've used this recipe for YEARS.  Everyone who has had it begs me to make it.  Adding peanuts ups the ante to deliciousness.  I've also drizzled chocolate over it with success.  1 c chocolate chips and 1T shortening microwaved at 30 second increments until melted.  Drizzle over the popcorn (on a cookie sheet) and allow to cool.  I've done peanuts AND chocolate with this recipe.  Divine.

So easy and so delicious. I used a glass bowl instead of the bag. Next time, I want to try adding cashews and drizzling with chocolate. The other day, I found myself eating this for breakfast, just can't get enough, it's truly addicting.

This was sooo good! I took it to a baby shower and had several people ask for the recipe.  I only had dark corn syrup and it worked just fine. I look forward to adding the chocolate chips next time.  The idea to put it in a bowl and then transfer it to get the unpopped kernels out easier was a great idea.  Thanks for sharing this!

This was great! Not only for popcorn-I had a big bag of puffed spelt, like puffed wheat, I tried it with. I didn't do the bag, just poured it over the spelt in a big glass bowl, then micro'd again 1 min., stirred, and another min. Poured out on wax paper to dry. very good, I'd do this with other plain cereals too.

I was in the middle of a late night, bunny slippered must have crunchy / salty / sweet / chewy super craving fit.  I tried this recipe because I just happened to have all the ingredients.  Who knew that I was soon to be in snack heaven?  Dinosaurs walked the earth when my microwave was born so I actually upped all the times.  Ok, that’s not quite true.  I didn’t up the times when the popcorn was supposed to be in the paper bag.  That’s because I didn’t use a paper bag.  After I put in the baking soda I tasted it and said, good enough, mixed things together as well as I could in a large bowl and ate it.  Remember, this was an EMERGENCY!  I figured it was late enough that the popcorn police wouldn’t catch me.  Turns out that the unmixed globs of caramel at the bottom were some of favorite bits.  This stuff is wow.

WOW...I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! All I did was a few minor changes... 1. I calculated for 8 servings 2. All I had were lunch brown paper bags so I put four cups of popcorn into each bag to microwave it. 3. I poured the carmel on the popcorn while it was in the bowl that way it covered throughly. And guess what??? I got it right the first time!!!!! GREAT RECIPE WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!

IMO this is a 4 star recipe using margarine.  If you use butter, it would be 5 stars.  It makes a difference.  The cooking time needs to be less; I burned the first batch, but it was easy enough to try again. Second batch was yummy!

The BEST EVER! I'm a huge fan of caramel popcorn. During the Holidays I will drive 40 minutes to a small shop that sells fresh caramel popcorn without the nuts. I hate the nuts! I have tried to replicate this recipe myself many many times, it's hit and miss alot. This recipe was so simple, I will never go back to the oven method. I followed the directions exactly (4 quarts is 16 cups, or two standard sized bags of that Famous'O' man) I didnt have baking soda, so I used a teaspoon of baking powder. It it perfect! Also, our microwave is small, so instead of one large bag we split it and put a bag of popcorn in a lunch sized brown bag (double bagged it) and the second bag, in a second brown bag. You just split the liquid in half, and dispense evenly. Perfect! It set up in less than 10 minutes! What a great, easy, fun snack.

Love this.  A family member gave me a very similar recipe--  and like another reviewer, it called to SPRAY (with Pam or the like) the inside of the paper bag, before adding the popcorn, i think it helps with the coating.  
I also agree with ilareau, that it really HELPS to pour the popcorn into a bowl first, and scoop JUST the popcorn, NOT the un-popped kernels, into the paper bag, that way you aren't trying to chew pop corn kernels coated with caramel!
I added slightly chopped peanuts, and it was DELISH!  I think Toasted Pecans sounds like a yummy addition.  SO that is next!
My recipe says to microwave only for 30 seconds at a time, about 3 times.  So that's what I did..  maybe closer to 20 seconds each time.  I HALVED the  ingredients that make the caramel, and used 2 bags of microwave popcorn...  Was perfect.

The first time I made this, I forgot the butter.  So the second time I made it, I remembered it, but it was better without the butter!  It seemed like the butter made it too mushy.  Of course it tasted good, so I ate it anyway, but I think next time I will cut way back on the butter.

I just finished a batch of this up.  It is great.  The cool thing is the seeds stuck to the bag so when it was poured out there were very few seeds.  I also loved one less messy pan to wash!

I've made this recipe since I was a child, and it's truly my favorite caramel corn out there! I personally LOVE caramel so I like it when it is hot and gooey. YUM!

I love this recipe!  I have made it sevarl times because it's so easy.  I like to add nuts (salted, honey roasted, whatever's in the pantry) in the last stir!

I made this as part of a Valentine's Day goodies giftset.  Easy and great results!!!

It's hard to know just when the caramel sauce is ready b/c of the microwave prep.  I keep forgetting to add the baking soda, but it came out well.  Make sure u use a large enuff container for the caramel sauce b/c it will overflow.  I added a cup of raw almonds and doubled the caramel sauce.  Use the garbage bag... the batch I made by stirring wasn't nearly as impressive. A smidge more salt or salted nuts would be a nice improvement for my recipe. I used a natural plain microwave popcorn instead of air popped as directed.

I think the 'goodness' of the recipe comes more from the ingredients than the actual recipe.  My batch was very gooey and sticky, not crunchety like i was hoping for.  It still tasted good, but was soft and un-caramel-corn-y.

Pretty darn good. I definitely agree that the timings need to be adjusted to fit your appliances & taste.
   I mixed the popcorn & caramel goo in a big plastic tub instead of the paper bag, and zapped it in the microwave for about 30 seconds after mixing it all together well to melt the caramel onto the popcorn.  It's a yummie snack that i would make again!

I had a recipe years ago that made the best microwave caramel popcorn but through mutiple moves it was lost in transit.  So surfing around to find another I run across this one, and after reading all of the good and the bad I decided to give it a try.  It came out perfect, not to sweet not burnt.  I think my only advice to anyone trying it is to remember that all microwaves heat differently.  My microwave melted things up nicely in about a minute and a half, and I stirred then micrwaved for another thirthy seconds.  I think if I would have went the recommended length of time it would have burned.  I did skip the part about putting it back in the microwave after I put the caramel on, I just shook it up and served it in a bowl.......My family loved it, Highly recommended.

Who knew caramel popcorn could be this easy!  I used REAL butter instead of margarine, plus microwaved Extra-butter Popcorn and omitted the salt.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Make sure you pour it out of the bag and spread it out asap or it will harden in a big chunk.  But even then it would be delicious.  :)

Great recipe! Beware of the chemicals in bags of microwave popcorn. Hot air poppers make your popcorn more fluffy and less "butterflies" than in the microwave. Mushroom popcorn is the fluffiness and worked well for this recipe. 

Shake the sack between caramel pours and you can achieve full, even coverage.  I used one hand to pour and the other to shake the bag. Shaking it seemed to bring the uncovered pieces to the top.

I was so afraid of burning the caramel corn that I under cooked it and it came out sticky when I spread it on the pan to cool. I put the pan in the oven at 350 for five minutes or so and the texture came out perfectly crisp.

The popcorn/caramel burned well before 70 seconds at normal full power in my 1100-watt machine, although the recipe does not mention what power level to use. I'm sure it's great when it works, I'm sticking to the oven method.

This is my go-to caramel corn recipe. Perfect every time. I pop my corn in a pot, the old fashioned way.  I don't measure the finished amount of popcorn, but I start with a generous ? cup of kernels, and the amount of caramel works great.

using the helpful tip to stir in a bowl before putting in the paper bag made this a great recipe! So fast, less cleanup, and the caramel is more equally spread than any other recipe I've used. I found that my batch was a little sticky, so I spread the caramel corn out on a pan that I had covered with parchment paper and put in the over at 250 degrees for about half an hour, stirring every 10-15 minutes. This is what the stove top recipes do, and I found that it made the caramel corn crispy. SO GOOD!

Really good and really fast.  I also made a half recipe.  I made the popcorn with an air popper and just mixed it up in a bowl (didn't have paper bags.)  Be careful of the caramel boiling over in the microwave during the second 1.5 minutes of microwaving.  I used a covered glass bowl to microwave it and it got all over the microwave!

I use a nearly identical recipe in class with my students.  They are 11-12 years old and just love making this!  I usually have each group of 3-4 kids make a recipe that is about half of this one.   We only cook the popcorn in the bag 30 seconds at a time and heat it twice.  That may cut down on the burnt popcorn issue.  We also make sure to shake it for a full minute each time and coat the bottom part of the bag with cooking spray first.  Enjoy!

This is THE BEST! My mom made this when we were kids. Just a hint- make sure you have the popcorn totally coated before you heat it in the bag. It will not melt, you have to really shake it and get everything distributed. Depending on your microwave you may need to cut back on the cooking time by thirty seconds or so. (I did one minute the last two times.)

Ooohhh my GOODNESS!! Do yourself a favour and MAKE this.  My kids just can't stop eating this and I've had to make extra batches to go round the neighbourhood!  Fantastic recipe. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and shook it up in a tupperware bowl and it works perfectly. Mine hardly ever gets to cool down before it disappears. Easy to make and not a lot of washing up either - thanks Subgirl!

This is so easy and fantastic! I needed something quick for a football watch party and this was a big hit, with my friends and my family. I accidentally didn't follow the instructions and it still turned out great (i added in the soda with all the other ingred.). Will definitely make this again and again.

I remember making a recipe like this in a H.S. Home Ec class and I'm glad I found it again! It was yummy! I only had light butter popcorn on hand (in the bags) so I omitted the salt. It still came out great!

This was indeed super fast and easy.  The caramel wasn't very strong, but the consistency was just right and the coverage good.  I followed the recipe for 8 servings and used it to cover 6 cups of popped popcorn, this was just right.  Follow the microwave closely.  I cut all cooking times down by almost a minute and kept a close eye on it.  Overall, this is a yummy recipe that I will make again.

I tried this recipe it turned out great.. I changed it a bit. I did as recipe said but the last step of putting popcorn and Carmel in a bag.  What did was cook Carmel for 3 min then stired then cook for 1 1/2 more minutes, put in soda and put it aside then I used a microwave popcorn.. as soon as popcorn was done I poured popcorn From the bag into my bowl of half the Carmel... Very yummy

We had left over popcorn from a movie we went to and wanted to make caramel corn with it.  This was amazing.  The only thing I did differently was leave the salt out because the movie popcorn was already salted and buttered.  Very addicting!  I will definately make again.  Quick and easy snack!

This is an awesome recipe! I've made it many many times for my husband, his friends and as gifts! You can also try adding peanuts into the bag with the popcorn and then drizzling melted semi-sweet chocolate over the finished product for some extra "yum." SO good!

Super yummy!  Have made this twice, I made it with a stick of butter instead of margerine, and I found it to be too salty with the 1/2 tsp salt, added only 1/4 tsp the second time and it was perfect for my tastes.  Beware, though, very, VERY addictive!!!

Kids and I were craving a sweet snack and this was great!  I scaled it down to 10 servings since it was just the 3 of us.  I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted a Tbs of light molasses.  Turned out great and much healthier than some other sweet tooth cravings!!  Definite keeper!

Awesome recipe.  It has been a hit every time I have made it.  I did have to reduce my microwave power to 70% to prevent burning.

this is an awesome recipe except I think it is ABSOLUTELY necessary to use butter instead of margarine. Margarine made it mushy and kernels shrank to a wet mess.

I can't believe how easy and quick this is!  This stuff tastes like someone was doing some hard labor in the kitchen.  You know those rice cripy treat commercials where the mom fakes her culinary blood and sweat?  You could fake it with this stuff too.  YUMM-O!!!  Also, I screwed up and put the baking soda in with everything else, not paying attention.  Whatever!  Didn't matter.  Still delicious!!  Our resident popcorn connesiour (aka picky teenager) says two thumbs up!

Exactly what I was looking for with a small change. There is a woman in our neighborhood who makes this and refuses to give out the recipe. Everyone is dying to have it, and I found it on here! The only change I made is to substitute white sugar for brown and use a plastic bowl with lid instead of a paper bag. SOOOO GOOD!

We LOVE this recipe.  It is really tasty.  I used kettle corn and added Spanish peanuts and it was a great combo.  Be sure to use Spanish peanuts because the regular peanuts are too bitter.

This popcorn is so good. I didn't like the idea of using corn syrup and someone had suggested using honey instead. It made a wonderful substitute and gave the popcorn another layer of flavor.

I made this recipe to the "T"!!!! Fantastic! This was so fast and so easy to make! this will be my "go-to" caramel popcorn recipe. No more with the slow oven way...! I used Smart Balance Non-Hydrogenated Margarine. It work great! I might start to cut back a little on the margarine as I make this more often. I used a Trader Joes Brown Paper Shopping Bag as my brown bag and it worked great!!!!! Make sure the caramel syrup boils for a bit in the mircowave instead of taking it too early. It needs time "cook" and get to the "soft-ball" candy stage in order for the recipe to come out as stated. After I poured the caramel onto the popcorn, i shook it a bit, but i needed to then use a spoon to get every popcorn coated. It worked great! Ty for the great recipe!!!

This was a great, quick recipe, much quicker than doing it in the oven.  The only thing I changed was to microwave it 30 seconds at a time and then stirred it.  It didn't burn at all.

Not only was this super easy to make, it is the closest think to Cracker Jack, that I have come across.  I was a little leary about the baking soda, however many reviewers said not to omit and that it was essential to the results.  Mine did not get crispy, so I'm blaming the humdity. Will definitely try again, perhaps using salted butter and leaving out the salt.  Would be excellent with salted peanuts or pecans.

Wow, who knew this was so easy. All the microwaving seemed a bit too involved - i just did it on the stove top. I popped my corn on the stove-top, too. I drizzled the topping and mixed in a large bowl. Worked perfectly. Under 10 minutes from start to finish.

I followed the directions exactly as written and it turned out great.  I've since made it a second time, added peanuts, and microwaved it in a very large bowl instead of a brown bag and it worked almost as well.

Oh my goodness! I'm sitting here eating this right now.  I was craving caramel popcorn and there is another recipe on here I love, but it takes so long.  This is wonderful!  The only complaint I have is you can't lick the side of a paper bag. ;)

It is very good and I like the fact that it will keep in a covered container.  It is very sweet though.

This was a good recipe. I cooked 3 mini bags of kettle corn popcorn, and used butter in place of the margarine and added some pretzels and cheerios to the popcorn. It did not need the added 1/2 teaspoon salt. My husband and I were surprised at how crunchy it turned out. Nice!

I have used this recipe since I was a kid and have never gone wrong. I would not recommend putting the bag in for more than 30 seconds, but that is just me. Also, if you have baking soda that is OLD... don't use it for this. You want the new stuff so the caramel can "double"

Wonderful!! And so easy!! I've never made caramel corn before it and it turned out prefect. 2 3oz bags of popcorn is just a little bit more than 4 quarts. Remember to remove unpopped kernals so you don't have to worry about them while you are enjoying it! Everyone at my party loved it and ate it all up. Even my husband who doesn't like caramel corn loved it! An idea to kick it up a notch-add chocolate covered almonds!

My husband loved it and asked me to write down the recipe for him.  My only complaint is that it wasn't as crunchy as I had hoped (but good enough), and also a little too buttery - maybe can reduce the butter a little.  I took advice of others and didn't cook the caramel too long to avoid burning.  I air popped 1/2 cup of corn and it turned out to be 3-1/2 quarts so I think another 1-2 Tbs of corn would do it.  So the caramel corn was a little heavy on syrup but that's my fault.  I suspect oven-baked recipes might turn out crunchier but for the convenience, I would definitely opt for this method!

Easily the best, fastest, and easiest caramel corn I've ever made.  I threw everything together in a big Pyrex bowl (couldn't find a paper bag) and it worked great, aside from having a big sticky bowl to clean up.  My husband wanted something crunchier but I like it a little gooey...and for five minute's work, this was fantastic!

I lost this recipe and was glad to find it on Allrecipes! I use Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend, and two bags of microwave light butter-flavored popcorn seems to be the perfect amount. The micro cooking times in this recipe did not work for me, they are too long both for the caramel and the combined brown bag. The caramel bubbled up & over the top before I figured it out! Mixing in half a cup or so of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the brown bag makes the BEST chocolate caramel popcorn!

absolutely delicious!  You have to pour the caramel on the popcorn fast, otherwise it will start clumping.  However, I think it will melt again in the microwave.  I recommend using a big bowl with a lip or handle to help pour, as the bowl gets hot.

I followed the recipe as stated but for a few changes. I swapped corn syrup for what we call Golden Syrup in New Zealand. Halved the sauce and because I had no paper bag big enough, I lined my roasting dish with baking paper, spread out popcorn and poured sauce over. Baked at 180 celsius for a few minutes - stired and a few minutes more. It browned nicely and came out crispy and wonderful! Now I'm on the lookout for paper bags especially for this recipe.

Amazing! While I was making it, the crowd in the kitchen said things like "I'm terrified of what you're doing to that popcorn!" They thought it would overcook due to being returned to the microwave . . . their concerns turned to cheers!  Seriously:  SO good, SO easy . . . and simple cleanup!  I made this with 1 pan and 1 spatula.  I added some toasted pecans, just 'cause I had them and they were a great addition.  Paper bag worked great, not a single negative about this one!  Great post!

I could not believe how fast and easy this one was!  From start to finish it took only about 20 minutes and it was addictive.  Next time I think I'll add some salted peanuts to give it that sweet/salty thing I love so much.

This recipe is awesome! I made at least 5 batches over the holidays and I fogot to add the baking soda to all but one. Honestly, I couldn't really tell a difference. They all came out great and when I told people I made it in the microwave, they couldn't believe it! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Oh, make sure you use a big enough bowl in the microwave because the caramel at least doubles in size while it's cooking.

Such a wonderful recipe! I have made caramel popcorn for years by, boiling the mixture to softball, loosing my candy thermometer, and dirtying several pans. What a treat to just pop 2 bags of buttered microwave popcorn, (or 4, I usually double it so it lasts a little longer)put the recipe in a glass bowl and microwave! The buttery/salty flavor of the popcorn mixes with the caramel for a great flavor! Sometimes we like it a little softer so I put the paper bag in the microwave for just 45 seconds each time instead of the 1 minute and 10 seconds. And WOW! It doesn't make it through the night!

This was very yummy, but I'll need to make it more often because it comes out too sticky.
My microwave seems to cook too high.
Either it burned or was too sticky.  But loved it anyway.... yum!

Delicious and Easy!!!!  Used real butter and only used one bag microwave popcorn and cut caramel recipe in half.  It did burn a wee bit, and I'd already cut the last two end cooking times down to 1 minute, so will try cutting the last one down a bit more.

This should be illegal! I limit my consumption of caramel corn to the holidays because it tastes so good and takes a little work to make.  This recipe is dangerous, not only is it tastey but it is easy to make and quick.  I've made it a few times now and have taken some restraint by reducing the caramel to popcorn ratio.  No specific amount, I just make about half the caramel recipe and pour it over lots of popcorn...I still get to munch on yummy caramel corn but it's "healthier" because there's only a touch of caramel instead of the blanket. :)

This was very quick and       
easy. The flavor was amazing:) The only con is that a little 
of it came out burnt. Next time I will adjust the time in microwave after the caramel is spread over the popcorn. Thanks so much for sharing.

My mom-in-law made the long version of this over the holidays.  I was hungry for it tonight and tried this out - it was even better than hers!!!!!  The paper bag makes the coating of the caramel so much easier!!!  I also added some salted peanuts and sunflower kernels to the mix - yummy :)  Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY GOSH! This popcorn is THAT good. Super easy. Followed others and skipped the second microwaving. Used 1/3 cup butter instead. I also used 2 bags of micro butter flavored popcorn. Makes exactly 4qts.

EDIT:

mmmm, A+, this popcorn is delish. I'd cut back on the butter a bit, maybe 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup.. just a suggestion! Good recipe though, thanks!

Good taste, bad texture!  Carmel corn should be crunchy, not soggy and chewy, which is the way this turned out.  Maybe using less glaze in proportion to popcorn would help?

The only complaint I have is that each and every time I make this, I have to make it twice because one batch simply is not ENOUGH!

We love it! Super simple and the way you cook this leaves the popcorn perfectly coated and it has a nice crunchy texture- not one of those carmels that gets stuck in your teeth. 

LOVE IT! Thanks!

I don't know what I did wrong but I just set a bag of popcorn on fire in my microwave. the smell was horrible! I did taste some of the caramel before I put it in with the popcorn and it had lots of potential...I will not try this again.
 Okay, I did try it again, but only because before it burst into flames the caramel was great. This time I did not microwave it the final time. After mixing in the baking soda, I quickly stirred in the popcorn. I quartered the recipe and it didn't even cover a whole bag.

my husband LOVED it! I made it all in a large bowl not a paper bag, some of it burned during the last minute and 10 seconds, next time I will shorten the last bit of time, I think my microwave is to high.

I made these to try them out so that I had something to bring to an annual Christmas party later this year. I have always had a hard time finding a recipe good and quick enough to make during the holiday season, so I was trying this out now rather than later. This recipe was really easy and quick to make, and my family really enjoyed it. I first used a small, thin paper bag, and the caramel sauce leaked through the bottom when I was shaking the bag. I then had to start over completely. I used a very thick bag and it ended up turning out great. I will definitely use this recipe for my Chrismastime events.

This is fantastic.  It's easy and quick.  I substituted 1/2 of the brown sugar with splenda and added a tablespoon of molasses.  This will definately be a keeper.

Hello, this is the submitter of this recipe, so excuse the rating if you wish.  Some of the problems with the recipe maybe that people are making with microwave popcorn when the recipe is intended for air popped.  Hope this helps with some of the problems.

I need to cut back on the time a little, it tasted a little burned -- but microwaves vary. Otherwise, it's a really great way to make this.

I have made this recipe since my kids were small & they are now in their mid 30's.  It's always a hit.  The only thing that has changed is that due to increased wattage in microwaves the time that  I microwave the popcorn and caramel in the paper bag has changed.  I place the  bag in the microwave for 30 seconds then shake and turn bag over for another 30 seconds.  Then I pour it onto the wax paper.

Put popped corn in large bowl, shaketo setyle “unpops”, them lightly lift into bag by handfuls, leaving “unpops” in bowl. I use butter instead of margarine & popcorn does not stick to bag. I shake well before microwaving first time, too. Microwave for 90, 60, 40 & 30 second, shaking WELL  between each heating. Pour out & spread out on parchment paper  until cool. Never fails. ALSO USE 12 OZ PUFFCORN IN PLACE OF POPCORN FOR HULL FREE, DELICIOUS SNACK!!

I hit my stash of Boy Scout microwave popcorn which had butter flavor on it for my 2nd batch.  It tasted better than the 1st batch of plain popcorn. 
I also found that the paper bags from my local grocery store were a little reduced in size from the previous year which left little room to fold the top of the bag down .
The recipe was awesome though and very easy to make!

Make sure you stir well to incorporate butter and sugar.

Ilareau - You have added some excellent suggestions to the method of this recipe.  I've been making it for years and not until today after reading your post did I think to pour the sauce over the popcorn prior to putting it in the bag .  I used a giant Tupperwear bowl that works perfectly and without ANY mess.  Before I struggled with getting it in the bag and when it was finished a lot of the sauce was still in the bag. I lightly sprayed all surfaces the corn touched with PAM so no stick anywhere.  One difference in my recipe is that mine says to cook the sauce in MW for 1 -2 minutes or until it boils then boil 3 minutes.  Also salt, soda and vanilla are added together at the end of the 3 min cooking time.  It's about the same but might help keep sauce from burning.  This is a delicious recipe and it's hard to keep from eating i t all.  I have never been able to complete the process in 15 minutes though, more than double that time for me i guess b/c I try to get perfect popcorn and that takes me awhile but eventually I get 16 cups of perfect popcorn:)  Love this stuff!

Used two packets of microwave popcorn.  As one packet was done, put into a bowl and bounced it on the counter to allow the unpopped  kernels to go to the bottom of the bowl, then put in brown bag.  I cut about 6" off the top of the brown bag to make it a little easier to handle.  Cut back a little on the salt since the popcorn is salty enough.  Followed the remaining instructions as posted. Key is to shake shake shake the bag each time. Turned out perfectly.

Worked perfectly  even after a few modifications.  I followed the recipe with only two substitutions because I used what I had on hand.  I used 2 bags of Movie Theater Butter popcorn and substituted Agave for the corn syrup.  IT WORKED!  The key to even coating is a large paper bag.  Pour half the caramel coating into the bag onto the popcorn, SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE. Pour the other half and SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE.  Microwave 30s, SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE microwave 30s SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE.  I layed out popcorn on flat surface to cool and harden.  PERFECT!!!!

I found this recipe after my husband had searched our pantry for “Fiddle Faddle” or “something to munch on”.   The fiddle Faddle had long since been thrown out after getting old and stale in the pantry.  I made this according to the directions, but cut the last cooking time by 10 or 15 seconds. I was afraid I would over cook or even burn it since this was my first time to use recipe, and most recipes using a microwave say times may vary. It turned out perfect!  I’m not sure if it would really make much difference to cook for full time.  I will definitely be making this again!  It is so easy!

I loved this concept. I have made candied walnuts before and should have followed my instincts. I did cook it for less than the 3 minutes and got the candy mixture to softball stage (or maybe hardball). Then  I followed the directions for putting it in a bag and back in the microwave the proposed 1:10. Couldn't even open the bag because I could smell it was scorched. Stuck it in the carport.

It would really be nice if Allrecipes required the wattage to be listed for microwave recipes  or tested them and noted. I will probably try again.

I usually make Caramel Popcorn on the stove, but this is a lot faster. I only had a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, so I added a 1/2 cup of white. I also buttered the popcorn before I put the caramel on it, mixed and heated it in a bowl. It was delicious! I would definitely make it again.

I'm about to make it a second time. I will leave it in the microwave a little longer as I like it a bit less chewy. Edited bits will follow the "*".  *I added about 90 seconds and so far it seems better. I also made it with about 1/2 cup Dark Brown Sugar, and 1/2 cup Light Brown Sugar. (I just filled the one cup measure cup about 1/2 full of dark and then the rest light) It gave it a slightly richer and a little bit less sweet flavor. I want to call it more "adult" flavor -- but kids would still love it.

As others have said, lose the unpopped kernels. I'm planning to use my cookie cooling rack to strain them out when I make this in just a few minutes. *This didn't work as well in practice as I had hoped, but it did work well enough to get them out. Just do it on a clean surface as you will spill some, no matter how careful you are!

Also, I recommend that you omit the salt unless you are using unsalted butter. *Much better when I did this.

I'm adding nuts to mine too, so we will see how that goes! *I added about a cup of mixed  nuts (salted cashews, almonds and pecans). I eyeballed it, so that is an estimate. I added the nuts before the last time I put it back in the microwave (and added another 30 seconds to the time - I kept an close eye on it). I ended up pouring a few more nuts in as it didn't have as many as I would like. Probably 1 1/2 Cups total. I highly recommend adding them into the sugar mix before the last time your microwave it.

Something else I didn't think t

I followed the recipe except I used honey instead of corn syrup. I poured the hot mixture over the popcorn, and I lined two 9x13 pans with aluminum foil, and then I sprayed the foil with Canola cooking spray. Then I poured the popcorn covered with the caramel syrup into the two pans and I baked them at 250 degrees for one hour. It was really great that way. I give this recipe only three stars because I do not have a microwave oven anywhere near large enough for such a big paper bag. In fact, most microwave ovens that I personally know of in other people's homes are too small for the paper bag in this recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


If you don't have corn syrup, you can just use regular old breakfast syrup. It's basically the same thing, except flavored, and it tastes delicious with this recipe. 

The recipe was basically perfect until the last microwave step... Lol I'd recommend either skipping this step or watching and microwaving in 15 second increments. My popcorn was a tiny bit burnt, but didn't affect much. 

Other than that, this recipe was so good!

This tastes pretty good but when you shake it in the paper bag , it leaves half the caramel in the bag no matter how long you shake it. Will not make again.

I kept feeling like I was going to forget the baking soda, so I measured it out, and left it in plain sight ready to mix in... yet somehow, I forgot it anyway! I was worried the caramel would be too hard, but it wasn't. I added an entire jar of peanuts because they are my favorite part. That's about 2 cups, or one peanut in every bite. In ratio to two bags of popped no butter, light-salt, microwave popcorn, the 1 jar of peanuts and the amount of sauce was perfect.

Oh my goodness!  What a perfect treat this makes.  I used one bag of popcorn and halved the rest of the ingredients and it made a wonderful light coating on the popcorn.  I did use salted butter as that is what I had on hand and did not add the additional salt.  I did not have a paper bag, so I microwaved and stirred the ingredients per the recipe in a large glass bowl, added the baking soda, added the popcorn and covered loosely for the last two, one-minute cooking sessions.  It came out effortlessly on to wax paper to cool and is sweet, a little salty and crunchy in its final state.  Addictive!

Super good and super easy!  I didn't have popcorn to make myself so I just made two bags of microwave buttered popcorn and eliminated the salt from the caramel recipe.  I also added some chopped pecans and it was delicious!  All ready in less than 10 minutes!

I used butter not margarine. I did not add vanilla until done cooking in microwave, just before the baking soda.  I cooked for 2 min 50 sec and then 1 min and 20 sec when making the caramel. I did spray Pam in bag before adding my air popped popcorn. Once caramel was on the popcorn I microwaved for 30 seconds twice.  Shaking well after each and putting folded bag upside down the second time. Very good!

My husband and I really like this recipe as is, but he is a huge fan of sorghum and asked if I'd try substituting that for the Karo syrup. It turned out great! We've now made it two nights in a row! I tried the suggestion by another to spray the bag with nonstick spray and that worked nicely too. Thanks for this yummy recipe.

OK. I'm a seasoned cook. I wanted a quick way to make Carmel corn and had a recipe for the stove but it takes forever so I searched. This recipe is good the way I tweaked it. I used a stick of butter instead of margarine as margarine is loaded with water and shouldn't be in Carmel. I also used honey instead of corn syrup. A Carmel corn should not have to be cooked after its stirred. So I cooked the Carmel the three minutes and then checked and noticed it was still grainy because the sugar wasn't dissolved. Not good. Back in the microwave for another minute and a half. I did cook in minute intervals for three minutes stirring after each minute then thirty seconds three times stirring it should be bubbly. Remove stir in baking soda then pour over the popcorn. Transfer to a cookie sheet to cool and dry. That's it. Taste great. I dislike bagged popcorn so i made my own. I removed unpopped kernals too.

I love this recipe. My daughter makes another allrecipe popcorn that takes an hour or more and while it's really good, it's no better than the Microwave Carmel Popcorn. This is fantastic and I make it often for movie night!!

I tired this and did 3 bags of microwave popcorn. I found it to be too much vanilla? Will make again with half a tsp instead.

I had a recipe similar to this that I got from my sister years ago - hadn't thought about it in years. So today I decided to give in to the craving and wouldn't you know I couldnt find the recipe anywhere? I only made a half batch and I cooked the caramel for 2 minutes, took it out and stirred it and then back in for another minute and a half. I tossed it with the popcorn and spread it out on parchment and it was as good as I remember my recipe being! My sweet tooth thanks you lol

Just made this!! It was so easy and SOOO yummy! I coated the popcorn in a bowl before transferring to the brown bag, which was sprayed with cooking spray. I will definitely be making this more often!

I must have done something wrong.  Maybe cause I didn't use the paper bag?  Although it tasted good, the popcorn didn't stay crispy.

Very good and easy. It was done in about 2 1/2 minutes in our microwave. Also, shaking the bag did nothing to mix the caramel, so I kneaded the bag until it was well incorporated.

This is my go-to recipe for caramel corn.  It's easy, delicious and foolproof!  I've made it dozens of times and it's nice to have a good recipe that doesn't require cooking in the oven and trying to stir every few minutes.  This is done in just a few short minutes and couldn't be easier.  Instead of a paper bag I spray a big plastic bowl that has a lid with cooking spray and then I can just pop the lid on and shake it.  Then you can put it right back in the bowl for easy storage!

Great recipe!  Followed the advice of nuking for 30 seconds and shaking well instead of letting it cook for longer periods of time. If you don't let it cook long enough, it will be chewy instead of crispy.

It was a hit in our home.  I used two bags of microwave popcorn. Instead of putting the popcorn and caramel in a brown paper bag, I reused the popcorn bags to make the caramel stick to the popcorn, and nothing stuck to the inside of the bag.  I didn't want too much popcorn in the bag because it might hinder the shaking process, so I repeated the microwave step four times.  PERFECT-O and I was a hero in my eleven year daughter's world!

Very good! Made it many times just as written. I do watch the timing carefully as my microwave tends to cook faster. Sometimes I use caramel flavoring instead of vanilla - the flavor and smell reminds me of the commercial caramel corn I loved as a kid.

I popped two bags of microwave popcorn. I emptied the bags and sprayed them with cooking spray.  I refilled the bag with popcorn. I left enough room to fold over the bag and I used a 1/4 of the mix and only 45 seconds with the carmel coating each time. My husband LOVED this recipe.  I put peanuts into his bag.

Just made it and it's delicious!  Omitted the salt since I used microwave popcorn that has salt already. Really shake bag with sauce well before turning out on waxed paper. I had to toss it after removing it to coat it better. I also sprayed my bag first.

Used 2 bags of 3.29oz Orville microwave popcorn and skipped the salt. The quantity worked out well. Took others' advice to transfer the popcorn to a bowl to rid of corn kernels that didn't pop, and to stir the caramel in. Then I put the popcorn back into the original microwave bags (which was already coated with oil) to continue with the second stages of microwaving. Turned out great with just 2 minutes. Love it!

My husband and I really loved this.  It's so simple!  I used real butter rather than margarine, and did not cook as long in the microwave, as some said theirs burnt, and I do think that is the microwave. I just eyeballed it (well, smelled mostly).  I think I did a minute and a half, a minute after the stir, and then 45 seconds after the coating.  Also I used two bags of light microwave 
popcorn, and this was enough for both, in my opinion.  (Used light because I've been trying to use up a box.)
I did not have a paper bag, so I coated and re-cooked in a large flat rubbermaid container, like the kind you carry cupcakes in, instead of the plastic bag.  I coated, put the lid on, and flipped upside-down and back a few times.  I do think that it is imperative that you spread it out and let it cool because it will harden at this time.
Agree with another reviewer:  don't skip the baking soda.  You definitely need it.  Also with another reviewer: dump out your popcorn and then pick it up and put it back in so that you get rid of the kernels.  They will stick into the caramel corn and you will bite right into them if you don't.  So glad someone mentioned this!
Thanks for this recipe!  It's going to be a great addition to our family movie night!

Have used a recipe similar to this for several years.  I use butter and only cook the caramel sauce 1 1/2 min, stir; cook 1 1/2 more min, for total of 3 min.  We like ours chewy.  Traditionally make it on Halloween for the family to munch on.  This is definitely our favorite confection we enjoy most in the fall and winter months.  One must be careful to take in account their microwave wattage.  I think that is why some reviewers report failure.  Thanks to reviewers for all the suggestions for changing this up by adding various kinds of nuts, etc.

Followed the recipe but the sauce smelled burnt.  When put on the popcorn, it tasted bitter.  Will not try again.  Have tried another caramel popcorn recipe which was perfect but couldn't find it again.  If I do, I will post it in Allrecipes.

YUM!!  And so easy!  Well, a lot more work than regular popcorn but this was my first attempt attempt at caramel popcorn and it was a hit.  I admit I toned down the popcorn to topping ratio a bit to be healthier.  I made it 75% strength (3QT popcorn to 1/2 this recipe of toppings).  Also toned down the microwave time. I did 15 second at 80% power for each of FOUR turns, shaking each time.  Easy enough and yummy for the whole family!

we've made this several times! it's easy and delicious! one note on popcorn measurements: the small boxes of micro popcorn contain 3 x 3.3 oz bags. This pops out to just 1 quart! So stock up on the pantry-friendly popcorn if you want to have it on hand.

I was really craving caramel popcorn tonight, but I was out of both margarine/butter and didn't have any corn syrup.  I read the reviews and decided to use Canola oil and honey as two different reviewers had done. The first mixture turned out a bit oily after cooking for the 3 minutes and the 1 1/2 minutes and adding the baking soda.  I decided to drain off about 1/2 of the remaining oil on top and let the popcorn absorb the rest.  I poured the caramel over the pre-popped popcorn (with the unpopped kernels removed) that I placed in a large, greased bowl.  I stirred it as best as possible and then placed it in the pam-sprayed paper grocery bag.  At this point I still wasn't optimistic of the results, but I forged ahead!  I microwaved it in the bag for 1 minute, shook, flipped, and microwaved it for 45 seconds the second time.  I have a 1200 watt microwave and I think I will reduced the first microwaving to 45 seconds as well. I opened the bag and much to my delight it looked and smelled delicious!  I let it cool on a wax-paper lined cookie sheet and my craving it satisfied.  This was amazingly easy and I can only imagine how rich it will taste with real butter, corn syrup, and some peanuts the next time a craving hits!  I think this recipe is extremely adaptable to other flavor additions as well.  Pinning this one to Pinterest!

For 1/2 cup of kernels (~16 cups air-popped corn), I altered the recipe to make 1.5 times the amount of caramel. I also added about 2 cups of whole almonds, pecans and walnuts and it was a wonderful crunchy addition. However, I ended up microwaving the coated popcorn to dry it out in 5 batches, for about 4 to 5 minutes each at 50% power. It still didn't end up as dry/crunchy as I would like, but I think only I noticed the difference. For a quick-and-easy caramel popcorn recipe, this is definitely a keeper. YUM - my husband and I finished all 16 cups in 2 days!

Super easy, and delicious!  I only microwaved it for 1.5 minutes, and then 1.5 minutes for a total of three minutes. Mine was sticky, just like we like it! We don't microwave it after we put it on the corn.

I have failed (BADLY) at making "traditional" caramel corn, so I am thrilled that this recipe worked. And it's so simple! I only had a medium sized paper bag from the liquor store, so I cut the recipe in half and used one bag of microwave popcorn. I microwaved the syrup ingredients for 90 seconds, stirred, and nuked for another 90 seconds. Just as a warning: The baking soda is absolutely integral. After the kernels were coated, I microwaved the paper bag for 45 seconds at a time, instead of the originally suggested 1 min 10 sec. The caramel corn is cooling now, and it looks and smells great! (Okay, it tastes great, too, because I ate about a quarter of it as I was spreading it on the wax paper.) Remember that if you're using salted popcorn, skip or reduce the salt in the caramel sauce.

This is the easiest recipe to do. I did it with my 7 y/o.  I didn't use bags, I used a big glass microwave safe bowl to heat the carmel/popcorn in.  Oh my was it good. But watch out, you will eat it all in one sitting.

I was skeptical at first to do this in the microwave, but I needed a quick sweet fix, and this is the easiest and fastest caramel corn I could find. I didn't have brown sugar, and used organic unrefined sugar, so I thought it would not turn out right, but it did! I used Double-Strength Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract and I also used microwaved popcorn to make it an authentic microwaved snack! I will definitely make again and make sure I use brown sugar and I will add pretzels and nuts and see how it turns out. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I used 2/3 cup unpopped popcorn (popped in the microwave) and about 1 cup peanuts.  Also used butter in place of the margarine.  Definitely take the time to remove unpopped kernels.  We only had two and they're no fun to bite in to.  It's almost as good as my much more difficult recipe, so it get extra credit for how quickly this comes together.

We devoured this caramel corn!  I agree with previous reviewers that the microwave times should be around 30 seconds each.  This was so simple to make and my kids loved shaking the bag to mix the popcorn.

You are 15 minutes away from Caramel corn happiness!! I think the hardest part is knowing how long to cook the coated popcorn in YOUR microwave. I cooked it for 1 min. 10 seconds then shook and flipped and cooked for 1 min 30 seconds. Mine came out just a little chewy. Next time I will try 1 min 30 seconds for both cooking times. I say try it and see what works best for you. I know I will be making this one again and again so I will have lots of chances to perfect the cooking time!

This was great, I was a little skeptical when I poured the mixture over the popped corn I was afraid it would be soggy, but after cooking in the microwave and pouring it out to cool, it was perfect!! Hard to stay out of.

OMG This is so awesome. I thought it would be so complicated and to think they sell it for $6.00 at the theater and no refill. I Love it and it's my wife favorite snack. I forgot the baking soda but it still turned out perfect. Would have poster pics but we attack this treat too quick:)

This is wonderful! It really only takes 15 minutes, and that includes popping time! I'm sitting here eating this right now and it's so good! I used 1 bag of popcorn (all I had) and the whole caramel recipe. There was a bit of caramel in the bottom of my bowl, but not much. My popcorn was evenly, heavily coated. I like it really sweet! I also used a bowl with a lid instead of a bag. It worked really well. Thanks for posting!

I had to leave a review for this one! I recently made this for a Halloween party I hosted. I am not an experienced cook whatsoever but I thought I would attempt this because it said it was "easy"and you were not lying. This was an easy recipe but the end result was so delicious my guests thought I had put a lot more time and effort into it. My husband loved it so much he said I could sell it at the county fair. By the end of the party there wasn't a popcorn kernel left! I have already been asked to make it again. Thank you for making it so easy and sharing!!!

This was the best caramel popcorn that I have ever had. It was so easy to make, I could not believe it.  My mom, who is the harshest critic could not keep her hands out of the bowl.  The whole batch was gone within hours.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

Fantastic! As easy, delicious, and addicting at it sounds! Just watch so that the caramel doesn't boil over. I used Allrecipe's "Microwave Popcorn" recipe for the popcorn, using kernels in the microwave instead of paying for pre-packaged. The flavor of butter over margarine was worth it too.

I'm one of those people that don't usually do reviews unless they are really good.  This recipe is incredible!  They only negative thing I have to say is watch your times.  I did burn mine the first time around.  I will never buy caramel corn again!

I'm normally a chewy caramel popcorn kind of girl, but when a pregnancy craving hits, you don't ask questions! This was a really simple, yummy recipe. Here's what I did: used 2 bags of microwave popcorn and pulled out any kernals. Made caramel mixture, using unsalted butter and omitting the salt in the recipe. Microwaved for 3 minutes, stirred and added baking soda, micro'd for 1 more minute. Poured over popcorn (a helper would have been nice!), and cooked for 1 minute each side. I didn't have wax paper so I just used a baking sheet mat. This will be a go-to snack in our house! I wonder if I didn't cook for that last minute, it would be that soft chewy texture I love? I'll try that next time...

Don't double the recipe on this one.  My first batch was a single batch and it was outstanding-- had the consistancy of cracker jacks.  We had movie night here so I doubled the batch but couldn't control the bag and therefore couldn't mix it well because bag got soggy and hot...the result is the soggy popcorn.  We also took the time to de-seed it, otherwise we would break a tooth because you just gobble it up!  Fantastic recipe.

This rates right up there with the best caramel corn I have ever tasted!  I followed many of the other reviewers tips about the cook time.  I did 1 1/2 mins. twice for the caramel mixture, and only 45 secs. twice, for the popcorn in the paper bag.  I reduced the serving size to 12 for one microwave bag of popcorn.  I wouldn't change a thing, and will make this again.

Really good. It's okay if you have dark corn syrup - it tastes just fine. The only thing is that you better eat it while it's hot because it will all harden together.

Flavor on this, excellent, but for some reason mine was soft.  Once fully cooled I put it in ziplocs, but it never did get crunchy. Next time, maybe I'll try pouring it out onto a greased cookie sheet and then toast it up in the oven for a few minutes, but I don't know if that would melt the caramel off and ruin the whole thing... Since it was so easy and still tasted so good, I still give it 4*s, but if the texture was crunchier I would've given it 5.

Yummmmy!!!! I just made four batches of this as something different for our PTA bake sale. At first I was worried because I didn't have a brown paper bag. Worked out great using a big plastic bowl with lid. I used butter and air popped popcorn. As with any recipe using popcorn you should removed any unpoped corn. I shortened the microwaving time at the end to 45 secs. This turned out perfect!! Nice and crunchy with a lil bit of chew. The only problem was I ate too much when I was bagging and now have a belly ache. So worth making again!! Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! I wanted a caramely kettle corn, starting with 2 quarts of popcorn.  So I cut the caramel recipe by 1/4 for 1/2 the popcorn.  To get a little smokier flavor, I added a touch more corn syrup and an equal amount of molasses.  I microwaved the 1/4 recipe of caramel mixture until it bubbled, then I stirred it, microwaved it for 1.5 minutes and stirred it again and microwaved it for another 45 secs.  Like some reviewers said, pour it on quickly or the caramel will start to set and use a larger bowl as it will get quite hot and be tough to handle!  It turned out wonderfully, smoky molasses hint and all.  Making this with a cut-down amount of caramel to popcorn ratio makes this a caramel kettle corn that is out of this world.

I made the corn, followed all the directions and it was a TOTAL DISASTER!!!! Please tell me what I did wrong. Does the power of the microwave have any bearing on the outcome? Mine is 1500 watts.

This is awesome! I cooked the caramel for 3 40 second intervals for the first 2 minutes stirring in between and than 2 1minute interval and it came out wonderful. Even my husband who doesn't like sweets enjoyed this.

Easy and delicious. I salted the popcorn (popped in a little oil on the stove) and added sliced almonds and pecan halves. Made an awesome gift for my co-workers in little bags with bows.

I am normally a horrible cook/chef, but even I can do this!  I did giant batches last year and put it a decorative bag and gave to co-workers as gift.  Easy and cheap.  It was so easy.  I knocked out 5 large grocery bags full in one night.  This year I am scaling back, but will also include the pretzels, which were hugely popular.

I loved this recipe.  My husband said it was like crack...LOL.  He could not stop eating it.  So much fun, and so easy to make.  The brown bag is essential to this recipe.  No clean up, just throw that messy thing away!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I plan on putting this in my Christmas tins for friends.

The family loved it! i made the following changes: cut the ingredients in half (The family loved it! i made the following changes: cut the ingredients in half (omitted the salt)and tried it on one bag of popcorn- I also drizzled melted white chocolate on it at the end to make it look better. Definitely lower the time in the microwave- just 30 seconds two times and it was done! Thanks for sharing such an easy and tasty recipe!

I love this recipe. It is easy, fast and tasty. I have cut the microwave timw down because my first try with this recipe the popcorn was a little burnt. I use about 1 and 1/3 bags of microwave per recipe and I do everything else the same as per the recipe. It is a BIG hit with everyone and this year I am making it for Xmas gift.

I usually can mess up an easy recipe. I made this 3 times before I mastered it!
Follow ingredients and instructions exactly. Grocery size brown bags worked best for me. More space allowed better shaking and coverge. Used wax vs foil which worked BEST. If you follow the instructions it will work out great. I found adding more popcorn to the brown bag did not work as it didn't cover as well. I made this for a fundraiser and got about 3 good size baggies per bake. Alot of work but it is really very good!
I also cut the margarine in 1/2 which saved money to stretch it out. I normally use butter so I can imagine what real butter would have tasted like!!

The best Caramel Popcorn recipe I have made and it is as easy as pie! Mine came out perfect. Needless to say it didn't last to be stored in any container. Don't forget the baking soda.

This recipe is amazing. I work full time and have a full time job with my family, so cooking usually takes effort and energy I don't have. This is fast and easy and YUMMY! The only thing I changed is reducing the butter by 25%. It was still delicious, I'll be making this again and again through the fall and the holidays.

I have a recipe like this but it calls for spraying the inside of the bag with a non stick spray.  Not sure if that's because of the chemicals used in processing paper bags, once the heat from the microwave hits it, make me weary.  Still a good recipe though.  Any thoughts??

So quick & easy...even though I forgot the baking soda. I was out of corn syrup & used maple syrup (nobody even noticed). It took about 20 minutes & it was gone.

Absolutely wonderful!  And super easy!  What more could you ask for?  Update:  The first time I made it I used real butter.  Just made it again using Smart Balance margarine.  Not nearly as good!  Will just have to use the good stuff!

There is no way to describe how incredibly delicious this caramel popcorn is.  And better yet, it takes no time to make.  I found the brown bag method better than the bowl method for mixing the popcorn with the caramel.  Either way, my family can't get enough of this stuff!

I just got through making this recipe, followed the recipe exactly except adjusting micro times and using a large tupperware bowl instead of plastic bag,  and it is delish!!  I'm actually eating some right now :)  I always make cookies and candies as gifts at Christmas, and this will definately be added to the list this year.  It reminds me of Cracker Jacks, I think next time I make this I will add peanuts or pretzels for that sweet/salty taste.

Hold your horses everyone!  This one is a keeper.  Way too good to be made if you are not expecting company!  I made this for my son's birthday party and found myself parked close by the bowl a lot!  I doubled the recipe and it worked great in the microwave.  You really do need to shake it vigorously, so don't be shy.  I also added a small can of roasted salted cashews to the bag of popcorn before adding the caramel.  Sweet and salty . . . do I need to say more?

This was such a strange way to make popcorn but turned out tasting good. It was a bit messy and awkward to make all in a paper bag and the microwave. Not sure if I'll go to the trouble again, but tasted yummy.

YUM! and QUICK! After reading other reviews I figured I join in...and yummo! I was the one with the candy thermometer and the condensed milk and the soft boil and all that.HA! not any more. I used 2 bags o popcorn which was more than enough and I did watch my microwave times as mentioned in other reviews. I'll be making this often and will use the variations others suggested(peanuts, pretzels, etc.) Thanks for this- I needed it!!!

YUM! Five stars for an easy, delicious treat! I used air popped popcorn and 1 cup of Pretzel fish shaped crackers - perfect combo of sweet & salty. Also, I tossed the mix in a large Tupperware bowl with lid and microwaved it with the lid loosely on top as directed. Came out terrific!

It was really yummy.  The only downside, I thought, was that it was really chewy and got stuck in my teeth a lot.  I'm not sure what a good solution is to that problem.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! I followed the directions and ingredients to the tee and it was delicious! Make sure you have a large grocery-style paper bag though otherwise you won't have room to shake, which is essential for good caramel distribution.

Tasted just like my Granny's recipe from when I was a little girl. Give it a try!

This is dangerous because it is so easy and so good! I just used 2 bags of light microwave popcorn. Also the suggestion of microwaving the caramel for 1 1/2 and 1 1/2 min. is a good one. I think it depends on how powerful your microwave is and nowdays they cook pretty fast. This is a very old recipe because I remember making it in high school home-ec class and that was a long time ago!

Oh my goodness!!!!!!! This is the most awesome recipe. My husband says this stuff is sinful - he's a preacher:)) My kids fight over the bowl. I will make this again and again. Maybe add some nuts and put the commercial brands to shame.

I was searching for some easy candy recipes to use with my girl scouts when I found this.  Decided to give it a test run. I've made caramel popcorn before but this is the absolute best because it is easy to prepare, tastes great and the clean up is a breeze!  My two daughters give it two thumbs up.  I prepared just as directed except used 7 TBSP real butter and about 1/2 the salt. Thanks for posting this recipe.  We will be having caramel popcorn more often now.

Delicious!  I wanted to make this for a Halloween party and 1/2 hour before the party started I remembered that I hadn't made the caramel corn.  I was quickly able to make 2 batches with time to spare!  Everyone gobbled it up and raved about it.  I will definitely make it again.

VERY YUMMY! And crunchy! SO EASY! I did change the cook time because my Microwave cooks fast. I also used butter but only 1/2 stick.  BIG HIT! And I am having at my Daughter's pumpkin patch party.

WOW! I LOVE IT! I did alter to cook times due to my microwave, and as others, I didn't microwave in the bag and I was out of vanilla so I left that out, but it is sooooo good! I will be making this again and again and again... :-)

I have a recipe similar to this only mine doesn't have vanilla added to it.  I have used this recipe for years & when I make it I make 5 batches & fill up one of those cans you would get at Christmas time.  The only trouble with this caramel corn you can't keep from eating it---IT'S WONDERFUL.

I can't give the most accurate review because I messed up a little on it. (I didn't spread the caramel evenly, so it was pretty clumpy.) I guess I was mostly disappointed that it was hard and cruchy, more like Cracker Jacks would be. I was expecting it to be soft and chewy. It tasted good though.

Without thinking, I used pre-salted microwave popcorn, regular butter and added the 1/2 tsp salt in the recipe. WAY too salty! It wasnt quite sweet enough for my taste, but it was probably the salt over powering. Will try again, and omit the additional salt. Quick and easy.
