I made this earlier today but waited to really eat it until tonight so the flavors would meld together.  There will be none of this left after tonight!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, using a red jalapeno (which I prefer) and kosher salt.  The measurements are right on the money.  This is great by the spoonful or as an accompaniment to something else.  For those who aren't used to using jalapenos, be sure to read how to handle them, and know that each jalapeno has its own level of heat even by the kind of variety.  So you may want to tread carefully.  Thanks for the recipe!

I bought one jalapeno pepper specifically for this salsa recipe. I took Marianne's suggestion and used a red jalapeno as the recipe did not specify which kind to use. I also added a couple cloves fresh garlic. I wanted a variety of textures in this salsa--I threw half of the onion, all the jalapeno, the lime juice, half of the tomatoes, the cilantro and salt in the blender and used the "ice crushing" feature to chop them into a finer consistancy. I then folded the pureed ingredients into the remaining onion and tomatoes. This was very good--the longer it sits, the better it tastes. We ate every single bit of it with our Black Bean Taco Salads.

I made this to put on our pork tacos tonight but neither Hubs nor I could keep our mitts off it, surprising since I had asked him how he liked it and he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Not really,” but then kept right on eating it. And eating it.  And eating it.  Actions do speaker louder than words.  I cut the cilantro in half and that was plenty for our tastes.  I added some minced garlic but outside of that I left all else the same.  Delicious…and obviously addicting.

I read a bunch of pico de gallo recipes before coming to this one.I skipped everyone before this because they wern't authentic pico de gallo. This is the only pico de gallo recipe I put in my recipe box. I was looking for a authentic pico de gallo & here it is, Only authentic pico de gallo recipe on this website. Garlic does not belong in pico de gallo or garlic powder or seasoning & that isn't a personal preference I have NEVER seen it made that way & I've eaten lots of pico de gallo. Just so that anyone trying to add garlic or any of that other stuff knows. Also blending the pico de gallo, well that makes it salsa, not pico de gallo. This recipe is *perfect* as written.

I have made my own salsa for years but never stopped to figure out the amounts, just added this and that and if there was too much this I added that to make it the right blend. Your amounts were right on. I need the recipe because I have had people ask me for mine and couldn't give them anything more than the ingredients and tell them to figure it out. Now I have it, thanks. I use sweet onion in mine. I also crush the cilantro and roll it in my palms then dice it fine before adding it. It helps distribute the flavor and make it less intense in a single bite. I also use about three medium sized green jalapenos mainly for aesthetics as the green is pleasing to the eye with the red of the tomato. I like the flavor of key lime when I can find good fresh ones though that often doesn't happen in Oregon. I use four to five. I don't marinate but am probably going to try that if I make it the same day as I will use it, usually try to make the salsa a day before for the best flavor distribution though sometimes decided on the dinner plan the day of. Also have my special ingredient that I add last after checking the spiciness. Tiger Sauce! My all time favorite hot sauce. It just add a very special flavor. I am careful about how much I add depending on who is going to eat it. Kids and some adults prefer it on a milder side so I often split mine and then spice only part of it up for the more daring side of the crowd. I also do like to add some crushed garlic, about a half teaspoon.

I went EXACTLY as the recipe stated, and I never use recipes, but I wanted to dare to be different, especially with all the rave reviews. 

My salsa came out sooooooo SOUR!!! I have just spent the last 3 hours trying to fix it and ended up turning it into an actual salsa with canned tomatoes and sugar and cumin to try and tame the sourness. It is still uber sour, and I am really upset about it. I'm trying to understand if all the amazing reviewers love the sourness of that much lime juice? I don't get it. And the amount of red onion is crazy! 1/2 a cup would have been plenty and I will forever use a sweet yellow onion from now on, the red onion is way too overpowering. 
If I am missing something from this recipe and I made a mistake, then please let me know, otherwise, this recipe is terrible in my opinion.

Amazing pico de gallo.  Only addition was two cloves of garlic finely minced, added in with the onion, jalepeno and lime juice.  The marinating makes it amazing, it allows the flavors to blend.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

YUM! This is prolly the BEST pico I've ever had, yet alone made!!! Most pico's are almost bitter tasting because they call for waaay too much lime juice. This was near spot on! And, I think bioteacher is right.... Briefly marinating your onion / jalapeno mixture first is key. It allows the pungent onion to mellow out a bit. I also agree that hand-chopping your veggies is worth the extra effort. Paying careful attention to the chopping directions (i.e. finely chopping, dicing, etc.) is imperative - for example, finely chopping your onion and jalapeno pepper. Large chunks of both would overpower everything else. In addition to bioteacher's tips, I have a few to share myself. Both my hubs and I agree that this is MUCH better when served at ROOM temperature. I additionally feel (my hubs disagrees) that this is best when served FRESH. I didn't care for this nearly as much the second day. All in all, this is a great find on here and a definite keeper in my book! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe with the AR community, thebioteacher! :-)

Spot on. I use 2 or 3 peppers, depending on size. My husband loves this with tortilla chips. We also use as topping on tacos, burritos, soups, well I guess many things, but I especially love to mash avocados & mix this in for fresh guacamole.

I usually add garlic to my pico de gallo, but I decided to follow the recipe as written.  I didn't even miss it and my husband didn't notice either.  Great recipe!

I double this recipe because my family loves Pico de Gallo. I also used 3 jalapeno instead of 2 but only used 1/2 cup of cilantro because my family is not big on cilantro. It was a hit because none was left. I also add a pinch of garlic powder.

This is a KEEPER!!!  We cook Chicken Fajita's at least once a week and I make this with it every time.  I follow the recipe as written, make sure to let it sit in the fridge for a while to marinate the flavors.  It is great on chips and inside the fajita wraps with chicken.  Yummy!!!  Any leftovers (which there usually isn't I use them the next day on an omlet for breakfast.

All this recipe needed was garlic!  I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to the mix, and it brought the recipe up to a five! That a double batch disappeared in 2 days between 3 people was a testament to its yumminess! 
Hint: it was (even) better the second day! :)

IF you have any Salsa Fresca leftover the next day, use it in scrambling eggs. Just throw into heated frypan, no oil, let it heat and add whisked eggs with milk. Delish...can add cheese on top when almost done, if you like..Beats making Huevos MX....

This is my go to recipe for pico de gallo.  I especially like the measurements (listed by cup instead of by number of tomatoes/onions like you see on other recipes).  I make this all the time and call it my "secret recipe".

way too much lime- made it bitter and the red onion was over powering. I would use 1/2 c of white onion and 1/2 - 1 lime only.

This is my new go to recipe for Pico de Gallo. I followed the recipe and only added some extra jalepeno, which I discovered wasn't really necessary. Marinating the onion and jalepeno in the lime juice first really brings out the flavor. We even top broiled whitefish with this!

I love this recipe, and so do all my neighbors! I use fresh tomatoes and jalapeños from my garden, add fresh garlic. I make batches that serve 24, but I do put it in the food processor because I am a busy Mom and I don't have time to hand chop. This does get better every day it sits in the fridge until it's gone!

Insanely good! I added some minced garlic and used less jalapeno, only b/c we don't like a lot of heat. I kept everything else the same. To cut prep time, I pulsed with the food processor, just until everything was diced, I did not process until smooth. Served it with carnitas and the crowd went wild! Thank you for this excellent recipe.

Wonderful flavor, but I agree with the other reviewers that a few cloves of garlic would bump this up to 5 stars.

First time I made pico de gallo- loved it! perfect ratios, the only thing I did different was use white onion because I love a strong onion flavour.  Everyone loved it at our Canada Day party. :) Fresh, healthy and most importantly, delish!

Quite tasty.  Because we had no fresh tomatoes, we used a can of Muir Glen organic fire roasted diced, well drained.  Added garlic and did not use a whole teaspoon salt.  Thanks for sharing!

I did improvise a bit because I wasn't prepared with all the ingredients. I didn't have enough tomatoes so I threw in a can of blended stewed tomatoes. I didn't have a red onion so I used a white onion and 2 minced garlic cloves. My family doesn't like things spicy so I just used a half a jalepeno with the seeds removed. Even with all that improvising it came out wonderfully!  Can't wait to try the recipe again, the way it was written.

This recipe was just OK for my taste. I agree with other critical reviews stating that there was just too much lime. It overpowers the salsa and you can feel the sourness in your stomach after eating it. I tried adding a bit of sugar and garlic to balance it (which helped a little), but overall I'd recommend only using 1 lime (max.) and 1/2 tsp salt to the ratio of the other ingredients in this recipe.

Very good!  I used 1/2 yellow onion, instead of red onion, and added 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 t. cumin, then pulsed in my Blendtec.  Not hot; in fact, next time I'll add another jalapeno.  It was even better the 2nd day.

This is a good basic Pico de Gallo recipe , I always use white onion in my Pico and try to keep everything portioned to flavor profiles of each ingredient , that being said, a good substitute for the overpowering lime flavor some have complained about would be Red wine Vinegar by taste, 2 caps or dashes should be enough to start the maceration process and allow the ingredience to marry in the frig. serve with lime wedges on the side. If adding fresh Avocado add just before serving to avoid brown mushy Avocado. As a final though, this is a recipe that calls for taste as you go to make the recipe your own, living in Texas I've never tasted two Pico's exactly the same, a recipe is just a basic guideline to personal perfection. Also almost all the Taco Trucks or Mexican eateries in Texas serve their tacos with just white onion and cilantro chopped together with a squeeze of lime and a pinch of salt , which I tend to prefer for a dryer, less messy taco, now get to chopping and tasting and don't forget the ice cold Beer, lol !

Thank you for such a fantastic recipe! I brought this to work today for our Cinco de Mayo party. I got 1 1/2 quarts out of this recipe, and expected to take maybe half of it home. Nope. All gone except enough for about three chips by the end of the day, and everyone commented on how awesome it was. The only real change I made to it was to add some cumin, only because I love the flavor. I added it to taste, but if I had to guess, I'd say probably around a teaspoon. I also let the onion and peppers marinate for an hour before adding everything else, but that was more out of necessity with my schedule. I don't know if it made an actual difference. This was refrigerated over night before serving. This I do think made a difference. I tasted it 5 minutes after making it and was worried that it was way too hot for most people. By this morning, all the flavors had had time to blend, and the heat had mellowed.

I make this on a weekly basis, but I use serano peppers instead of the jalapeno and I add 1 to 2 riped avocados. They don't turn brown if you add lime to the pico. Instead of using the red onion, I like to use the white onion as well. Goes great with grilled steak or chicken.

Turned out great! My husband and I both loved it. Slight modifications...used poblano pepper instead of jalapeño, 3 1:2 cups of tomatoes instead of 2 1/2, and sweet onion instead of red onion. I had a big bag of sweet onions, so I didn’t want them to go to waste. Next time I’ll try it with the red onion. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!

Love this recipe!  It totally hits the spot.  Making this in WI in the middle of winter, I wasn't able to find a red jalapeno, but I did use a green one.   I also used tomatoes on the vine instead of Romas because they looked so much riper.  I added more lime juice, more like three juiced limes, because the tiny limes weren't enough.   I tried the recipe with and without garlic, both are great, but the recipe without garlic tastes fresher and cleaner.  I would add one more jalapeno in the future.

I've never made Pico de Gallo before, only salsa.  I doubled it except only used 1 tsp of salt in stead of 2 and I also added an extra jalapeno.   Family went crazy over this!  Awesome recipe, many thanks :)

Excellent with a little variation. I only used one medium sized lime and mixed 1/2 cup red onion with 1/2 cup vidalia onion as that was all I had and it was perfect that way. Also, I only had end of the season small garden tomatoes, so I seeded/chopped and used them instead of Roma tomatoes. Really good!

Love this stuff! My husband is super picky with salsas, we don't cook a lot, but he's asked me to make this one a couple times now. Takes a bit to chop everything, but the marinating really makes a difference. Set this out at a party and it will be GONE.

I love this recipe. Since first trying it, I now make a batch 3-4  times a month. It never lasts longer than 2 days even if only my husband and I are snacking. If more people are joining us I just add more tomatoes.

This was good, but I found the lime a bit overpowering, and this was after adding lime and a bit of ground cumin.

This is very good with the addition of a good dose of chopped garlic!  Next time I might try reducing the salt to 1/2 t.  Thanks for sharing, thebioteacher!

This recipe uses WAAAY too much like juice. It made the pico way too sour. You should really only need about 2 tablespoons of lime juice, not 2 whole limes worth!

I've made this pico de gallo several times now. My 10 year old and 11 year old love it! Even the neighbor kid, who doesn't like spicy, loved it. The amounts of the ingredients are perfect. For those who think there's too much lime juice, I thought so too the first time I made it, so I poured some off. It really depends on the limes you have. The first time I made this, I had limes the size of golf balls that gave a lot of juice. The second time, my limes didn't give as much juice. Tonight I measured: two juicy limes gave 1/2 cup of juice. I'd say adding anywhere between 1/4 to 1/2 cup of lime juice will taste good. Also, as you let the salsa sit and the flavors meld, the lime doesn't taste so strong. Thanks for the recipe! We're really enjoying it!

I've made this recipe many times exactly as is, and I've switched it around to suit what's in my fridge at the time. I've always been thrilled by the results. His tip to marinate the onions and jalapenos in lime juice before adding the tomatoes might just be the trick. Easy and delicious.

Made precisely according to directions.  I can see why others liked it - compared to jar salsa or the spaghetti-sauce style salsa you'd find in a restaurant outside of the Southwest, it was good, however, if you're already accustomed to good salsa from the Southwest, it wasn't that great.

Time consuming with all the chopping but oh so worth it!  I definitely did the marinating step but I didn’t pour all of the lime juice in with the tomatoes and cilantro.  I saved it back to add at the end.  As a result, it didn’t have the full 2 limes worth of juice; most likely one lime.  Saved the leftover lime juice in my homemade salsa!

I'm obsessed with this salsa! I've made it several times already and it's always a hit. Even the juice that's left at the end is delicious, and I may have poured it into a cup to drink once... Yes, the chopping takes some time but it's totally worth it.

We had a special Birthday BBQ with family and I decided to make this after reading all of the reviews. All I added was 2 tsp. of chopped garlic. Everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating it!  (They also wanted the recipe, which is always a good sign). We had only a small amount left so we're having it on our grilled fish today!

Recipe was good (as Modified): Cut down on lime (added last + to taste).  Added 1 tsp garlic since it was obviously lacking that flavor. CAUTION: a bit too salty - try 1/2 tsp, taste first, then add more if you think it needs it.  Otherwise, great. Will make again w these mods

AMAZING!!!  Sometimes I use a white onion instead of red.  Others suggest adding garlic, but I think it's perfect in it's "naked" state.  I can eat this by the spoonful!  A little trick to share: set the diced tomato in a colander and lightly salt, tossing occasionally.  Drains the excess moisture from tomato and makes a much nicer pico (imho).

Kept right with the recipe and it was great!  I didn't miss the garlic either.  Next time I will use a little less jalapeno though, just me.  I used some I had cut up and canned earlier in the year.

This lime based salsa does not work.i suggest dicei yellow onion and jalapeño with iron pan (ruin stickless pan) on top burner til brown and alittle charred(adds great flavor). Then chilli power, garlic powder. Put in container and add petite  diced large can of tomatoes ,cilantro, and salt. People will love your salsa.

This recipe is great, love it. Made it and me and my boyfriend finished it off in 2 days. Just added a couple cloves of garlic, but it would still be great without it.

This salsa is quite good and better than the stuff in the store. 
I added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder - just enough to compliment the onion.

Super yummy! I made it without the jalapeños since my 3 and 5 year olds would be eating it and it was still very flavorful. I can’t wait to try it with them included!

One of my favorite recipes!  I now live in Costa Rica and make it for my English class sometimes.  I add in a bit of minced garlic, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and a small can of black beans and bump up the lime juice a bit!  Fabulous recipe.  Thanks so much!

Loved it! After trying the original recipe, I added a couple minced garlic cloves, a bit more jalapeño, 2 green onions, and a little less cilantro to suit my person tastes. Excellent!

Fresh and delicious.  Loved the tartness from the lime juice.  I added a few cloves of finley minced garlic, but it really is good enough not to need them.  I will be making this again.

I  have made this several times for home, get togethers, etc and it never lasts the night. I make it exactly as written. Fresh, clean, balanced.  Great recipe!
Update 5-19
Made this again today for Cinco de Mayo . As usual, it was perect.  I had a few avocados  so I decided to use some of this to make quacamole.  WOW!  I can't  believe I hadn't tried that earlier!  DELICIOUS! 
From now on, this is going to be my two fer!  ???

I also noticed that someone added shrimp to their salsa to make more of a shrimp cocktail!

Could this recipe actually work as a THREE FER???  Stay tuned!  I might just find out today!  It sounds so refreshing and clean ?

Everyone loved it! I did add more jalapeno and a teaspoon of sugar to balance the flavor. The tip about the onions being marinated was great it really mellows the raw onion flavor.

Utilized fresh garden tomatoes and Vidalia onions.  It tasted great fresh after I added more salt, minced garlic and onion powder to taste.  I let it marinate over night.  I had to add more salt and jalapenos as those flavors seemed to be have been absorbed overnight by the tomatoes.  I had too much to eat fresh so I cold pack canned 5 pint jars.  I tried a jar and it was "almost" as good as fresh.

Best Pico de Gallo I've ever made or had. So good I'm never able to wait a few hours for the flavors to blend--I always have to have at least a few bites right away. So good I could eat the entire batch myself in one sitting, and have to stop myself from doing just that. I've used both fresh and jarred jalapeño and it's good either way. I always add garlic just because I like garlic, but I'm guessing it would be good without it. Awesome recipe. Thanks for posting.

Just made this recipe tonight to go with quesadillas---HOLY GUACAMOLE this is the PERFECT Pico de Gallo! It was one of the easiest recipes (perfect recipe to make with kids - you literally cannot mess this up!). The hardest part was chopping up all the tomatoes! But it is worth it...Finally happy to have the perfect Pico recipe - my search is finally over! The only difference I made was using locally grown Hanover Tomatoes and I left the seeds/ribs in the jalapeño!

Do yourself a favor and make this right now! Do not change the recipe unless you like it spicier then leave in the ribs/seeds! (Next time, I am going to add another jalapeño or two.)

This recipe is so simple and tastes so fresh!  I added two cloves chopped garlic and used 1 tsp Jane's Krazy Mixed-up Salt in place of table salt for the seasoning.

I've been looking for a pico de gallo recipe that approximated Mexican restaurant salsa for years. This is the best one I've found. Awesome fresh taste and great texture. Just a few adjustments:

1. I use canned whole tomatoes, and then squish them by hand. More consistency, better texture and flavor than fresh, and you can usually get a 28 ounce can for about $1.
2. I use sliced jalapenos from a jar. Less work and they are already pickled. I pour some of the pickling liquid into the jalapenos and onions with the lime juice.
3. I taste the end product and sometimes add just a teaspoon of sugar to offset the bitterness of the lime juice. Makes a big difference.
4. I also make a double recipe, as we go through this stuff very quickly at my house!

This recipe is great!  I did make a few modifications.  I only used 1 Lime.  I thought 2 would make it to strong.  My husband and I have been trying to cut down on salt, so I only put in 1/4 teaspoon.  For us, these changes made it awesome!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this recipe twice because it was so good, but i made some changes. It was much better after I added 2 cloves of garlic. I also put it through a food processor for a more fine and soft texure. It also helps with keeping it on tortilla chips.

I did add two cloves of minced fresh garlic. I made this early for a party I was having the next day and had trouble keeping people out of it before the party! It was very good.

This Pico is so good. I love to make with authentic coke braised carnitas. My husband accidentally bought me sliced,  jalapeño  peppers instead of fresh so I only used half the amount of lime since the jarred  jalapeños are already kind of sour. It still turned out great.

This is an excellent recipe!  There are endless possibilities to tweak this recipe to make it your own, or just make it as is.  I used white onions, and 2 green jalapeños, because that's what I had.  I measured the jalapeños, to see how much it is.  One jalapeño is about an eighth of a cup.  I used a one-fourth's cup to equal 2 jalapeños.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon of dried oregano.  Magnifico!

This recipe to me tastes special. As the author wrote, hand chop everything & let marinate in the lime juice. I followed the recipe exactly as written. This is fabulous! So healthy & fresh. Keeps your hands busy with all the dicing. I wouldn't change a thing besides if you can use all fresh, out of your garden produce, DO SO. Especially cilantro!! Thank you for this recipe:)

Outstanding!!  Just made this, my first time making a pico de gallo recipe and I WILL NOT be going elsewhere for a different recipe.  The only thing I modified was 3 jalapenos (left one with seeds) and 1/4 c. cilantro instead of 1/2 c.  Incredibly good!  This will go over great on Football Sunday's taco bar.

That one trick (marinating the onion and jalapeno in the lime juice) pushes this recipe over the top!

I added about half a clove of garlic along with the onion and jalapeno.

A mixture of lime and lemon juice makes a sweeter flavor, better with chips I think. All lime juice is better with meat.

Adding a little mango or peach makes a nice variation.

A  great thing about this is that you can make it fresh every time, and make just as much as you need. One Roma tomato per person is about right. There won't be any left over!

The name of the recipe made me giggle a few summers ago so I tried it.  My daughters and their friends loved i!  I get requests to make this each time they visited so now it is a tradition to have this  waiting for them when they visited during the hot summer days here in Florida.  Having it the next day or up to a week is even better.

This recipe was great! I also added some chopped garlic and fresh ground pepper, but even without those, it probably would have been awesome. I'll definitely be making this again.

This pico de gallo tastes amazing and is so easy to make. It's great with tortilla chips, but an even better compliment to tacos and fajitas. Made as directed and loved it.

I thought this was really good pico de gallo. I made a 1/2 recipe and just used 1 average sized tomato. For the lime juice I used 1 Tblsp and I left out the jalepeno, because I don't care for a lot of heat in salsas. I had thought it might be too much red onion, but it wasn't at all. I used it in a recipe calling for pico de gallo. Thank you.

This is a keeper.  My husband loves Pico and I have all the ingredients in my garden except the onions.  I think I might try with one lime instead though and see if I can get away with it.  Thank you for the recipe.

OMG, loved it!! Changed just a couple of things: tomatoes just 2 cups; rinsed onions in colander after chopping but before the lime, to take out some of that extra pungency; drained about 75-80% of liquid before serving (was very liquidy). Yum!! And completely agree that soaking in the lime juice really does make a huge difference! Kudos to your ex girlfriend's Mom - she rocks!

Really great!  My 12-yr-old daughter couldn't stop eating it.  I made this to go with the grilled fish tacos on this site.  Next time I think I will use a sweet onion instead of red.  I think the red onion is a little strong and competes with the flavor instead of complementing it.

I really love this salsa.  I just can't get enough of it!  The only change I made was to add a diced yellow/orange pepper and it's amazing.  The lime juice flavour is addictive and it goes great with my favourite blue corn chips.  I like to make it when we have friends over for bbq's.
