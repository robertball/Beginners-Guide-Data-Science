Hubby wants this to be my signature dessert.  It's incredibly rich & delicious. 
Use the rest of your heavy cream to make whipped cream (teaspoon of vanilla and some extra fine sugar to taste) to serve with this.   The whipped cream is the perfect addition.

There were not many reviews so I was a little skeptical but still I kept coming back to this recipe.  I am soooooo glad I did.  Incredible!!  Since I was making a small cake tower for a birthday party with different flavor cakes, I treated 12 foil muffin cups and baked 30-35 min.  After refrigerating, I removed the foil and turned them over on a rack and covered each in the glaze.  Delicious!!

Didn't care as much for the semi-sweet chocolate taste. You can tell the cake was made with chocolate chips. I have had many better chocolate cake recipes. Was extremely moist though, definitely not dry.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I did have a few problems with it though. Even when the toothpick came out clean, the cake still wasn't quite done. When it was cooling, it collapsed considerably and then I couldn't get it out of the pan nicely. My best suggestion would be to make it in small tins like for cupcakes. Then you would have individual cakes. Good luck with your cake!
