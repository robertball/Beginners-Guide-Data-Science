After making this many times I've settled on the following changes, which I highly recommend: 1) Pulse half an onion and several cloves of garlic in a food processor, then saut√© until the onions are tender and most of the moisture has cooked off. 2) Double the cumin and coriander, and add onion and garlic powder. 3) Add 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, preferably panko. 4) Form 8 smaller patties rather than 4 big ones. This has proven to be essential! 5) Spray Pam, also essential, on a baking sheet and bake the falafel at 400 for 20 minutes. Then spray Pam on the patties, flip them, and bake for another 10-15 minutes. This actually results in a crunchier crust than when pan frying this recipe. The first picture I uploaded of this recipe is the pan-fried version and the second is completely baked.

I was skeptical of how "runny" the mixture was when I was forming it into patties, only b/c I've always made falafel w/ at least 1/3 c. breadcrumbs (as opposed to a mere 1 TB flour), but Shazam!! I'm so glad that I tried this recipe b/c these were outstanding! My first recommendation though is to lightly sautee the garlic and onions in a little olive oil b4 mixing into the chickpeas and spices. I also skipped the pan-fry and simply baked them at 400 for 30 min., flipping and smooshing them half-way through. Served them in warm flatbread w/ the recipe from here for "Zucchini Salad with Yogurt and Walnuts" (which is really more like a tzatziki) and we inhaled these!

Absolutely loved it! Very easy recipe. To cut down on fat, I did not brown them. I spooned then into the oiled baking sheet, sprayed with a cooking spray, just like cookies, then baked them about 15-20 min per batch (time may vary). They came out softer, then hardened a little, as they cooled down.

Really good! It was our first time eating falafel, and we really enjoyed it. My dad watched me mixing up the chickpea mush and was not impressed at all with what I was serving (he's pretty skeptical of any meatless dish), but he ate it all up and said it was awesome! You know it's good if you get him to say so :) I didn't bother with the cheesecloth, just patted the onion with some paper towel to take out some moisture. I also just cooked completely on the stovetop as it's ridiculously hot here today and I didn't want to heat up both the stove and the oven. But when I make again, I'd love to try the oven to make it a bit healthier (but I guess a couple tbsp of olive oil never killed anyone!) They came out great, nice and crispy, from frying. We ate them inside warmed up pitas, with tzatziki sauce, and tabouli on the side. Yum!

Easy to make, very flavorful!  I didn't bake these, I just continued cooking in the frying pan. I used whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose flour.

Perhaps I am accustommed to authentic Middle Eastern food, but these were not flavorful enough for me. I liked the idea of using fresh chickpeas, but next time I will double the onion and seasoning and fry them instead of moving them to the oven.

Easy and delicious! I used less oil than recommended and it came out fine. I also added some fresh cilantro- excellent. I've found that you can saute and chop up pretty much any veggies you have and throw them in along with the onions and it tastes great. Just be sure to increase the am't of base ingredients if you increase the volume of added goodies, otherwise the patties fall apart. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I did use Whole Wheat flour in stead of all-purpose. Just made me feel better :) I thought this recipe was so flavorful. I warmed mini pitas in the toaster. If you cut a little slit in them and put the slit down first into the toaster, the pita poofs up. It is perfect with this falafel, some avocado and tzatziki.

I had an awful falafel at a high end restaurant last weekend and thought to myself "allrecipes.com can do better than this" and sure enough, this recipe pulled it off.  I found like other reviewers that they did fall apart but that was remedied by making a more fine chop in the processor instead of a coarse chop.  I followed the directions to a T but doubled it and stuffed it inside pita pockets with red onion, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes and tzatziki for a vegetarian gyro.  I also misted the patties with olive oil before baking so they didn't dry out at all.  
My recipe for tzatziki:  seed and grate 1/2 q cucumber and blot with paper towel, dust with coarse salt and let sit for 10 min.  Combine 1tbsp minced garlic, 1 1/2 c greek yogurt, 1 tsp fresh mint, 1/2tsp dill, 1-2tbsp olive oil and half a squeezed lemon.  Add cucumber and refrigerate for several hours for flavors to full merry.  
I think this was by far the best falafel I've ever had.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Awesome!

I love falafel, but have always been too intimated to make it from scratch. This is totally approachable and totally yummy. The baking was a great way to cut the fat, but the quick pan fry kept that deep fried flavor.

I'm really liking this! I've never had it before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It has tons of flavor! I did have to use Tones Parsley Flakes because I don't have fresh. And, I sprayed my cookie sheet with Pam & the tops of the Falafel and just did them in the oven, until I thought the onion would be slighly cooked. They are great, thanks!

I made this tonight.  I used dried garbanzo beans that I soaked and cooked first.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Sooooo yummy!  I will make this again.  I'm a vegetarian, but I'm sure carnivores would enjoy this too!

This one is easy and had very good texture and flavor. I simplified the steps a bit by processing the onion, parsley and garlic cloves  together with just a few pulses first, then adding the beans, soda and seasoning, and finally, hand mixing in the flour and egg. Patties held together well for me and were easy to form. I also like that this one scales easily, so I doubled the recipe and froze the extra patties individually which will be a great time saver for another meal. Since they were already in the frying pan according to the directions, I saved on cleanup by keeping them there for about 5 minutes a side, rather than transfer to the oven. I would either bake or fry these, but I wouldn't bother doing both. This is a great recipe and the one I will use for falafel from now on. Thanks for sharing it.

Oh my gosh!  Even better than the local greek restaurants!  The whole family LOVED this, and everyone had seconds, some thirds.  I didn't change a thing per the recipe and it was so delicious.

This recipe has become a staple in our house.  Every time I ask my husband what he wants for dinner, his answer is always Falafel.  I follow the directions exactly except for skipping the oil when pan frying (just use a non-stick skillet).  We eat them with pita, sliced cucumber, sliced tomatoes, lettuce, and tahini.  Delicious!!

This is the first time I've ever made falafel and I don't need to search any further for other recipes.  Very good and so easy.  I just threw everything in the food processor.  Didn't even bother squeezing the onion.  I didn't have coriander so I just added a dash of curry powder for the heck of it.  They were a bit mushy and had to handle them carefully until I got them into the skillet.  I didn't bother with the oven.  5 min. on each side in the skillet. and they were nice and crispy on the outside.  Served in pita pockets with Tabbouleh III (from this site) and Tzatziki (combination of Tzatziki Sauce I and II from this site) and was very happy with the results.

This falafel came out great! I don't own a food processor so I finely chopped the onion and garlic. I added a little bit of salt too for more flavor. I then combined everything in a bowl mashing it with my hands and rolled them like meat balls on a pam sprayed cooking sheet. Baked them at 400 degrees  for 20 minutes. Make a yogurt dipping sauce or put them in a pita pocket with hummus, tomato, alfalfa,lettuce,sunflower seeds and cheddar cheese. YUM!

Made exactly as written and was really good...a tad dry, but that's ok because we mash it up. Served as gyros inside some naan (instead of pita, since we didn't have any) with tzatziki, tomato, onion, & feta. Cousous (with lemon juice, garlic powder, salt, pepper, & feta), grapefruit, and oranges.

Thanks, Bette, and all the reviewers that preceded me.  This is a really good and fairly easy recipe.  Like others I "paper toweled" the onion and finished the patties in the frying pan rather than in the oven.  I omitted the baking soda as I was not sure of its purpose.  I did this mostly for sodium control.  I served these on whole wheat sandwich thins with Tzatziki sauce, lettuce and tomato slices.  I will definitely make this again! For anyone interested there is a great Tzatziki sauce recipe on Allrecipes.

The first time I made falafels was with this recipe. I love to cook food, full of meat, full of veggies or just plain vegan. This one isn't entirely vegan, but definitely vegetarian. It was a hit with people who didn't even like vegetarian food; people who couldn't even fathom eating a meatless meal. It's so full of flavor and texture that you don't even miss the meat. Be sure to have some excellent pita on hand, very fresh veggies (like chopped or sliced red tomato, fresh lettuce or spinach, and chopped red or strong white onion). You need a good tzatziki sauce to go with this, though. I know this site has an excellent recipe for that!

I've tried this recipe and it was good, slightly dry but tasty. Also, as far as adding crumbled bacon - I've never had a falafel that had bacon but you might want to give it a try and let us know if it was good. I'm rating this 4 stars and thank you for posting the recipe Bette.

Really good flavor, but a little on the dry side.  I like the fact that you do not use breadcrumbs in them.  I opted to not fry them, but baked them on a cookie sheet.  I'm wondering if I add the oil to the batter and then bake, if they would be a little moister?

The flavor was really good, but it was a little on the dry side....I just added extra sauce to it and it was fine. I was really excited that these didn't fall apart while cooking like my black bean burgers always seem to do.

I had never made falafel before but was craving something different for dinner. It was delicious! I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used some dried, but if you do this I suggest you use a little less. Either way it was great!

I love these sooo much. I used sprouted garbanzo beans  (chickpeas) that I had on hand instead of canned. Did not cook them. I am vegan so I used flax meal ( grounded flax seed) one spoon  flax seed  mixed with 3 spoons of water. I backed them and they were great. Will definatley do again...I might even try to dehydrate it for a raw version ..without the flour...

Very good! Time consuming though. Of course, I did increase the serving size to 6! I had no idea it would make way way WAY more than 6 servings. I will freeze some of them to have for later.

I changed a lot, but it turned out great and this recipe was the inspiration.

Used dry beans, and soaked them for 24 hours (no cooking necessary as the consistency was perfect after 24 hours) - used the equivalent amount as 1 can. Left out the egg and baking soda. Just popped an an onion in the food processor with everything else, didn't chop or squeeze it. Processed it all until smooth and fried quickly and then put in the oven. Absolutely delicious. I did forget the salt, and regretted it because it did need it, but that was my mistake. This was enough for 3 servings, albeit small ones.

Delicious!!! I followed the recipe, but I left out the coriander because I had none.  I really liked this recipe! It was my first time trying falafel and I decided to wrap it in a pita and made a gyro sandwich with cucumber, red onion, tomato, and tzatziki sauce.  So good, I will definitely use this recipe again! The falafel was good by itself and good in the gyro - great meatless meal and very filling.

This was pretty good. I doubled the recipe, but with 2 eggs, it was just too liquidy, so I added some bread crumbs. I also did not fry it, but just baked it for 20 minutes or so. I made it into 8 smaller patties and froze some raw for work week lunches. I will probably make this again. The frozen patties cooked up nicely in the toaster oven at work and were tasty torn up into a tossed salad.

Delicious! I used dried, powdered onion to avoid the juice draining process from fresh onions and reduce the amount to compensate. Overall, I'd make this recipe again and again!

I followed the recipe, except I baked for 30 minutes at 400; no frying. I should have fried them first, because they turned out a little dry in the oven... Today, when I warmed up the leftovers, I lightly fried them in olive oil, and they were absolutely delicious! Sitting overnight probably helped the flavors merge better as well, although I may add more garlic and spices next time. Served the falafel with the Tzatziki II recipe and lettuce and tomatoes on a warm pita. Yum.

I thought it wasn't that crucial to drain the onions... I was wrong!  They did not get crispy enough for my taste. Next time I will either drain the onion or use onion powder!

I make this at least once a month, I love this recipe!!! The flavor is so good and a bit healthier than a deep fried falafel. I pulse the parsley garlic cumin coriander and salt first until it's really fine. Then I add the garbanzo beans and baking soda and pulse no more than 10 times so the beans kindof stay whole. I usually fry them as bigger patties to make burgers with them because they fall apart a little. Overall they are really good!!

As this is my first time making falafel, I was not really sure what to expect. Suprisingly, this turned out really well. The only thing I was not crazy about was the falafel was a little mushy in the center, I guess I am more use to a drier (fried) type. Even with a little mushiness, the flavor was fantastic. I served this with flatbread, lettuce, red onion, tomato, and a tzatziki sauce recipe from this site and was very pleased with the results. I would absolutely recommend this recipe.

Flavor was great but they were a bit wet inside (even with a very good crunch on the outside). Not sure how to make them a bit more solid inside.

I did not fry the falafels but sprayed them with olive oil and then baked them at 400*F for 30 minutes.  We enjoyed them much better than the ones that we have tried that are fried.  We must not be big eaters as we have another dinner for tomorrow.  Thanks for posting this great recipe, Bette.

I prefer falafel fried, but this is very good if you're trying to cut down on fat and calories.  I made exactly as posted, served in pita pockets with lettuce, tomato, Feta cheese, and tamari dressing.  I wish I had added some sliced red onion to the pita pockets.

We, middle easterns, never use egg in our falafel & we use a combination of chickpeas & fava beans. The chickpeas should be double the amount of fava beans.

Kids and adults liked this recipe.  Easy to make.  I skipped the cheesecloth step. I chilled mine in the fridge for 15 minutes to make them easier to work with.  I do this with all different kinds of homemade veggie burgers.

This was my first time trying falafel and I loved it. The only change I made was using ww flour instead and ap. I served them the way the author recommended: in a a pita with tzatziki sauce. It was a great, healthy meal.

I liked it as a healthy lite sandwich that keeps U full . but it taste almost nothing like the real Falafel . I doubled the coriander to make it 1/2 tsp , and for more flavor I add 1/4 cup fresh Cilantro and one TBS of fresh dill . I use the following toppings for my sandwich: crumbled feta cheese , tomato , lettuce, onion, cucumber and Kalamata olives .

A bit scary when the patties were so soft and not molding before frying.  I just dropped them in the pan like pan cake batter almost and then they became beautiful. 

Easy, delicious, and meat free

Great recipe.  I used 1/2 tsp. coriander and 1 1/2 tsp. cumin, also left out the baking soda.  I also sauteed my onion and garlic before adding it to the bean mixture.  Thanks for the recipe, will be making it often.  Tastes great!

I really like falafel, but didn't care for the flavor of this one and I think it's due to the baking, rather than frying.  I appreciate the lower fat content from this method of cooking, but I don't think I will make it again...

These were great!  What an easy, healthful, and inexpensive dinner.  I sauteed in olive oil spray in a non-stick pan.  Baked on parchment paper.  My picky eater husband really liked them - I served them with hummus, grape leaves, feta, pita, and sliced tomatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Perfect! I made these exactly as written except I added grated zucchini to the mixture to add extra veggies.   I served it in a pita with Tzatziki, spinach, cherry tomatoes, and avocado. It was absolutely amazing!   The hubby has been raving about it since dinner!

As someone who is counting calories, I found this to be a great dish and was super simple to make.  Put on top of a lettuce of baby spinach, red onion, banana peppers, pickled turnip, cucumber dressing, and a little roasted garlic hummus.  Very tasty, low calories,.  This will be a regular dinner in my home.

Oops! Didn't have enough eggs! So I substituted with some Greek yogurt. Used bread crumbs instead of flour, and pureed everything till it was smooth. I ended up using a lot of bread crumbs so the dough wouldn't be too sticky to handle. The falafel came out well. Good to know, as we're  to eat more legumes

I followed some of the tips others had mentioned.  I didn't fry them in oil but baked them at 400 degrees for 20 mins on one side, flipped over and baked another 10 on the other side, spraying with cooking spray.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted dry.  I did saute the onions and garlic first before adding and pulsing in food processor with the rest.  I also added the 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs.  They held together very well and I didn't find them to be runny like others mentioned.  Servng them in pita bread is a great tip.  And there is a pita dough recipe ("Peppy's") on this website that I found very easy to follow using a breadmaking machine.

I followed the recipe but had to make a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used a little over a tablespoon of all purpose flour because I didn't have baking soda. I gambled on the fact that the all purpose flour had it in there already and hoped it would be enough. I didn't have coriander so I added a little turmeric instead. I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and just baked them at 400 degrees turning them over after 30 minutes. They were perfect! Totally satisfied my falafel craving with very little fat. It made 6 nice sized patties, and I'll definitely make this again!

This was really good. I served it with a homemade taziki sauce I found on all recipes on a bed of lettuce. Very good. And I just subbed gluten free all purpose flour for regular flour.

Made this tonight for the my Husband, myself and my 3 year daughter and we loved it! 
I didn't use a cheese cloth because I didn't have one. I just chopped the onion small and dabbed off any moisture with a paper towel. Lightly browned the falafel in a pan and then stuck them in the oven for 10 minutes. Served them in  warm pita bread with my homemade tzatziki sauce and side tabouli salad over some arugula! Healthy and delicious!

I loved this recipe. It was so easy and quick to make. I did not use a food processor because mine was dirty from another dish I made. I just used the back of a fork to mash the chickpeas and cut up the parsley. I love that I had very few dishes to clean at the end. I served this with a tahini sauce and tzatziki. The tahini adds some liquid if you find falafel a bit dry.

So this wasn't really falafel, but I really enjoyed them.  I skipped browning in a frying pan and baked them longer, flipping halfway through.

Eh.  The batter was so runny I added extra flour.  Baked them for the entirety of cooking.  Better after they'd sat for maybe 20 minutes, but overall just eh.  Update almost three years later: Hadn't realized I'd made these before and made them again. The batter was runny; I did not add more flour and it cooked to an okay, firm consistency. Just doesn't really taste like much. Probably won't make again. Took my rating down a star.

These were super yummy!  As I have no recipe to compare these with, I rated a 4 :)  I have never even eaten Falafel prior to making these!!  I decided as others did, not to fry them first, though I did spray them with some Pam.  I also made them into 8 mini patties instead of 4 large ones!  They came out great...now I just need to try another batch - either restaurant style or make some more :)

These were a little bland for me---I added garam masala and ground red pepper---but otherwise great! I used a 19oz can of chickpeas and subbed wheat germ for the flour, and didn't have a problem with the batter being too thin. Even my husband, an avid carnivore, raved about these!

Although my husband and I love falafel, we weren't thrilled with this dish. He (the eater) was put off by the texture, calling the insides 'mushier' than typical. As the cook, I thought the prep took considerably longer than 20 minutes.  The wet mixture was difficult to work with. Patties didn't retain their shapes and clung to my hands as I tried to transfer from plate to pan for cooking. 

Also, it would have been helpful to know in advance that spices could all be measured into same bowl, to avoid using (and having to wash) multiple vessels.

I followed this recipe to a tee, minus the coriander since I didn't have any on hand. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars because I don't think it's quite deserving of 4. I was surprised that the mixture was so wet after adding the egg and flour. I pan-fried them for a little more than 3 minutes, but they were still quite difficult to work with. Thankfully, they didn't completely fall apart.

I'd probably make these again, but I wasn't too crazy about them. While I'm a huge garlic-lover, I think the 3 cloves was a bit overpowering. I'd reduce it to 2 next time.

Excellent, I fried them only (no baking).  I added just a touch of flour to stiffen them up a little, and I sauteed the onions before hand and added it to the mixture.

These were awesome.  Loved that there is no fat or oil. I added more garlic because I love garlic; also more onion.  Next time I will leave out the salt as the canned chick peas are salty.  This is definitely going to be a regular on our table.  So easy to do.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

THis is my first time rating a recipe, but I felt I had to.  I am always trying new recipes for my family...and get fair reviews at best.  This one, my husband LOVED and asked me to make again.  I made smaller patties so It made more than 4.  If you are on the fence about this recipe, GO FOR IT!

These turned out really good. I used different spices but used the same onion/flour/baking soda and they had a great texture.  I ate these as burgers with avocado, lettuce and tomato.

This was fantastic - so easy to make, and my husband and I agreed that it had amazing real falafel flavor! I'll add a bit more salt next time I make it. I also used chickpea flour rather than all-purpose flour. I served these with pita bread and homemade tzatziki, along with a cabbage and parsley salad. Delish! I highly recommend this for your first time making falafel!

A definite five star recipe.  The flavors blend so well together.  It was my first time trying falafel and I think I found my new favorite food.  I served them with homemade pita bread and Avocado Tzatziki sauce.  Thanks Bette for the delicious recipe.

Overall very good. Great texture but lacking flavor a bit. Next time will increase herbs & spices, and maybe add some additional seasoning.

I made this recipe exactly as posted.  I used my cast iron skillet and it was delicious.  The patties were slightly difficult to flip, but the stayed together.  I might add a little more flour next time, but it is a keeper.

Great recipe! I read several recipes before settling on this one. Mostly bc it does not use bread crumbs and I am limiting my family‚Äôs carb and starch intake. I can do a Tbsp of AP flour. Changes I made to this recipe include hand mashing the chick peas and putting the onion in the blender with the garlic/parsley blend. I also added a dash of cayenne. Mashing the peas gave the parry more texture. I was very happy with the browning method in the frying pan using some avocado oil. I got it toasty on both sides then popped into the oven to finish off while I cut veggies for our lentil bowls. My kiddos and hubby loved this recipe and it is a new ‚Äúgo to‚Äù in our house. Next time I am going to try wheat flour instead of AP. Thanks for the inspiration!!

I love falafels, but I have deep fat frying. These are perfect. YOu crisp the outside in a small amount of olive oil in the frying pan and then bake them. We make naan bread to go with them. Even my kids who refuse to eat any form of beans will eat these.

Turned out wonderful! Twice as good as our local Mediterranean restaurants.Doubled the batch and seasonings as suggested. Used a hand chopper for beans, onions and garlic. Added hot sauce, lemon pepper and lemon juice. No need for oven cooks quickly just dropped by spoonfuls into pan. Best when eaten warm.

This was delicious! I made 3 changes. I saut√©ed the onions and garlic in the olive oil before adding them to the chickpea mixture. I made 6 smaller balls instead of 4, and I did not saut√©e the falafel balls before putting them in the oven. The falafel was crispy and perfect in a whole wheat pita with tzatziki and feta, lettuce and tomato.

Falafel always seems a bit dry to me so I replaced the flour with canned butter beans.  The patties were great when eaten freshly cooked.  However, the extras that went into the fridge were a bit dry when eaten a couple of days later. Perhaps foil or tighter plastic wrap would have preserved more moisture.  I'll continue to tweak this recipe.  Stand by ....

Excellent -easy, healthy and super tasty!  My hubby liked them better than from a restaurant.  Baked at 400 for 20min, spayed w oil again and flipped for 10 more min. Put all ingredients in food processor together, except egg and flour. Used half parsley, half cilantro and doubled cumin n coriander. Refrigerated patties overnight and baked next day. Fast n Easy!

I didn't have parsley so I used kale . The texture was same as meat .  The next time I make this recipe I'm going to try it with spinach .  This was a good meat substitute  My daughter gave them a thumbs up !

They came out like baby food with cooked chick peas. I don't know why I trusted this author. Always use uncooked (but soaked) chick peas for falafel.

This was great! I added  coconut flour instead of regular flour because it was what I had and it came out delicious and lower carb friendly ?? could probably  use almond flour next time don't even taste the flour ! Your only using a tbsp of it anyway!. I highly recommend  this recipe!

Delicious!  I ended up just pan frying to get them nice and crispy. Also threw in some cucumber skin that I had pealed off when making a Greek Salad - it mixed well and added some good nutrients while avoiding waste, win win!

A few of them fell apart but overall, this was a great recipe. My sister loved them, which says a lot. Just kidding. Highly recommend this recipe  to people who don't mind garbanzo beans.

This might be the first time that I've successfully made falafel, and I've tried numerous times. I'm never deep frying them again.

This mixture does indeed look runny but don't let that intimidate you! It will turn out perfectly fine. Also,  the recipe is a bit bland but I actually prefer it this way so that I can add some flavorful extras like salsa and feta cheese! I was going to try the Tzatziki sauce but I wasn't able to find any.

Just so-so.  I found that these were bland and not so flavorful.  I would recommend adding more onion and garlic (saut√©ing them in advance sounds like a good idea).  I would definitely double the cumin

This was super easy and super fast! I don't have a blender or food processor, but used my NutriBullet and it worked fine. Instead of keeping them on the skillet, I used a wire rack, which kept the patties nice and crispy on each side, and they came off the rack very easily. Will make this again - probably once a week from now on!

It is rather flavorless, bland.  Add more spices of your choice. I topped it w/ Spaghetti Sauce bc  of blandness. But i will make it again bc I like eating Bean Patties.

Fabulous!  Substituted flour for bread crumbs just because I like the texture.  Made 16 ping pong ball sized patties instead of the four large...way too big.  Served on pita with tabouli.  Perfect!!  :)

I was surprised this turned out as well as it did, considering the changes I made and my inability to read directions.  I substituted light red kidney beans (blasphemy, I know, but it was that or black beans) and a tablespoon or so of dried parsley for the fresh (working with what I had on hand here).  I also just mashed everything together with a potato masher since I don't have a food processor.  And by everything, I mean I included the oil, since I didn't pay attention to the directions.  Speaking of which, I let the mixture sit for 15 minutes prior to shaping it instead of after.  I decided to skip the baking part, since it was too hot out, and just scooped heaping spoonfuls onto the skillet (ungreased) and cooked them like pancakes, a few minutes apiece.  Tasty!  But they were best when piping hot, and seemed to lose flavor as they cooled.  This made about 8 silver-dollar falafelcakes (really 6, plus about 2 more worth of scraps and broken bits).

Really easy and good.  They held together very nicely.  I'll make a few changes to suit our tastes next time (more salt, cilantro instead of parsley, some hot pepper sauce), but this recipe is going into our rotation!

I agree with another tester here...I doubled the spices as well, and I suggest you do if you've had this kind of ethnic food and are used to the stronger spice flavours, which makes this recipe wonderful.  I used whole grain flour..it made me feel better!!  I made smaller patties, fried them up in a frying pan as instructed and finished them in the oven for the required 10 minutes...this helps alot with expelling more moisture.  I paired this with Chef John's Tzatziki sauce and soft warmed up pita bread....OMG, it's a staple now at our house.

Be careul not to over-process the chickpeas! The flavours are good and adding a bit of tzatziki... divine! Also, don't over-fry or they will end up dry. Other than that, so good.

I skipped the whole pan-frying step, and just baked them in my oven on a Silpat. The outside was crisp, and the inside was tender. Great flavor! I doubled the recipe so that I could have enough for lunch the next day. I did add double the amount of coriander, but that is just my own preference.

Made this tonight and loved how easy it was.  I didn't bake it in the oven though.  Now I wonder if that would have made it crunchier?  I wonder if dredging in cornmeal would add more of the crunch I had the first time I tried falafal at a local restaurant.

These are really good and super easy to make. I have to admit I made lots of adjustments based on what things I had on hand; I used lentils instead of chickpeas, leeks instead of onion, and a stalk of celery instead of parsley. In any case they still came together great, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and very flavourful. I cooked them for 3 minutes on my pancake griddle before transferring to the oven for 15 minutes.

Great low-cal version.  The falafel was a little dry. Next time would try, transferring to a pan coated with cooking spray to bake.  Also, would add a bit of hot sauce.

Amaaaazing! I followed the recipe to a T, except that I didn't have any coriander so I threw in a pinch of Clubhouse Chili powder. I served each patty in a pita with fresh mixed greens and herbs, sliced tomatoes, and mayonnaise.

Great meal and quick to make! Don't have a food processor so I just mushed the chickpeas with a glass before adding the rest of the ingredients.

this was delicious - I sauteed the onion and garlic with a little olive oil, and used whole wheat flour because that's all I had. I didn't saut√© the patties but baked them at 400 for 30 min. Served with pita, hummus, israeli pickles and olives and sweet potatoes. Perfect meal! Next time I will make smaller balls instead of patties. Thanks Bette!!

This was so easy and so tasty!  I didn't even bother using the food processor, I just mashed the beans with a fork and minced the onion and garlic extremely fine.  I had no parsley so I added basil (about a tbs) and it worked well.  Great recipe -  this is another addition to the healthy rotation.  Thanks
