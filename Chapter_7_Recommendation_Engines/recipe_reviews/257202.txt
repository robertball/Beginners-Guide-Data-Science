This recipe is foolproof. The mayo marinade makes the pork chops very tender. I substituted smoked paprika for regular paprika, and cooked the chops to 140 degrees. They had a perfect spice flavor. I couldn’t detect the lemon which was OK by me. I served it with baked potatoes, corn, and cranberry sauce.

Don't cook your pork chops to 165 degrees, they will turn out like shoe leather. I cooked mine to 140 degrees and let them rest until they came up to 145, you will be happy you did. The marinade is flavorful and is easily adaptable to suit your taste.

7.20.18  I used thin pork chops, and thicker would have been better.  They cooked in next to no time, and like many other reviewers mentioned, I cooked to 140ºF, and covered them for 5 minutes before serving.  The only flavor that seemed too dominant to me was the basil, so I'd probably cut that back in the future.  OK, but not sure I'll make again.

Pretty tasty, and they carmelize nicely on the grill. Golden brown and crunchy edges. Only marinated about two hours. Will do overnight next time. Will add salt also. Needed it for sure.
