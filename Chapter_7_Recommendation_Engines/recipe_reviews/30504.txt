We really loved this recipe.  I fixed it just as it says,. except I put my potatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes then turned them over for another 2 minutes, cut them in half and brushed the tops with olive oil mixture.  They were on the grill for about 10 minutes.  Skins were so cruncy and potatoes were so tasty.  Will be sure and fix them again.

GREAT!!! This is the best with your grilled meats in the summer.  I tried it as written, then made my tweaks.  New potatoes (red or white) are the best.  Added crushed fresh garlic instead of powder, and grilled both the skin and the "flesh" until nicely browned and crunchy on the outside.  In my opinion, there's no need to drizzle the remaining oil afterwards, it tastes great as is.  Make sure to add a little salt on top while they're still warm.  Made this for a family barbeque, and got rave reviews.  Easy to make-ahead- just pre-cook the potatoes and store in fridge with oil mixture until ready to use, then grill. UPDATE 8/19/10 I tried this basic method with sweet potatoes, cut in thick slices.  YUM!  Fresh Garlic and Rosemary are the best!

I've tried this wonderful recipe with reds, yukons and Idahos, and we really prefer the first two.  The consistency of those potatoes held up great to the spices and grilling.  Super-flavorful, crispy outsides and soft insides.  We love this recipe.

Excellent flavor and impressive presentation.  I didn't bother to pre-cook the potatoes.  Just tossed them with the olive oil and seaonings and placed them, flesh side down (for nice browning) in a pan made of heavy duty foil.  Delicious and beautifully golden brown.

I've made these a number of times now and I use individual microwave potatoes to cut down on the time.  I also lightly score the potatoes before tossing them in the olive oil mixture.  I cut the amount of black pepper in half.  These always come out nice and crispy. I don't drizzle them with any extra olive oil afterwards, just a little salt.

I took the last reviewers advice and used red potatoes.  I cut each one in half and followed the remaining directions.  Yum!  These have that great fried potatoes crisp on the outside without a lot of fat.  I will be making these again.  Fast and easy yet worthy enough to serve to company!

I skipped the boiling process and just microwaved for a few minutes. Then quartered and let marinate in the fridge until I was ready for them. Great flavor off the grill.

LOVED IT! I made a double batch, and  so glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly, mixed the spices together and dredged the potatoes in the mix; I found that I had to add more oil as I went along. I had some spice mixture left over, and I used it to season some portobello mushrooms I was grilling (added balsamic vinegar for that). Keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing,Todd!

There is not enough "marinade" for these potatoes as listed in the recipes, although it tastes delicious after cooking.  I would suggest doubling the recipe.

I loved these.  Really easy, great flavor.  It was a hair too much rosemary for my taste, but I like subtle flavors.  This will be one to play around with the seasonings and make all the time.  Definitely a great compliment to any grilled meat.  Makes it so easy to do everything out on the grill.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Perfect. Actually, I didn't realize you had to leave the skins on, so I peeled my potatoes and they were wonderful.

These were good - I followed the instructions as written. I laid some foil on the grill and cooked them on top of that and the bottoms burned. I think I'll have to find an alternative way next time.

A good potato side dish - I followed other reviews & did not add the oil drizzle at the end - the next time I will add the oil drizzle.

Loved it, can't wait to make again.  Only thing I changed, was instead of quartering, I only cut in half.  Topped with a little parmesan cheese.  Wonderdful, will be a regular potato at our house.

How do you reserve the liquid if this is on the grill? It doesn't say to put on foil or in a foil baking pan. Confusing to me?

I cook them in microwave, slice them in half lengthwise , then make slices(but not down to the skin), fill the slices with margarine, sprinkle garlic powder, pepper, and parsley on top. these are soooo good! In the winter I put them under the broiler and the edges get reallly crispy.....my b/friend loves them and even my fussy(chef)brother loves them too

I didn't have rosemary, I have never been a fan of it, so I subbed with dried basil. Also, the pepper seemed like way too much so I used 1 tsp and it was still too peppery. I loved the flavor the grill gave the potatoes. I will just cut back on the pepper next time. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and very good.  Steamed the potato quarters, instead of boiling, while boiling some sweet corn.  Next time I would cut back on the rosemary.

I doubled the amount of olive oil, but otherwise followed the recipe, and these potatoes were great!  I didn't have any leftover oil mixture at the end, but it didn't need it anyway.

Great (and quick!) recipe.  I agree with other's who've posted ... it is a good idea to double the recipe - olive oil mixture.  On my Webber, I grilled the potatoes on direct medium for 15 minutes, turning halfway and they came out perfect!

These turned out great & so easy on the grill. I had a lot of company so served some plain, some with cheddar cheese on top and some with the bacon/cheddar on top.

These were ok.   I don't think the grill flavor did much for the delicate potato flavor.  This is just a roasted potato recipe on the grill.  Next time I'll just roast them as usual - I think the flavor is deeper, with a nicer crisp, and not so many steps.  This was agreed on by the whole table.

Thank you so much for such a good recipe! I'm loving it! For more garlic flavor, I boiled the potatoes with a few cloves of garlic and a little salt. My potatoes were a bit too soft to toss with the oil mixture (my fault for cooking a little too long), so I drizzled the oil over, sprinkled the other ingredients, and grilled. I only had fresh rosemary, but the grill time is short enough, it didn't hurt the rosemary. I didn't bother with the second drizzle of oil, but a little more salt was in order. SO GOOD. What a delicious addition to our outdoor meal!

These potatoes are FANTASTIC! I used red potatoes as suggested by the other reviews. They grilled up fast, and the marinade added great flavor.

thank you, Todd, for the wonderfully simple and delicious side dish.  i will use this for company because it can be done, in part, ahead and i think it could be done in fair volumn, too.

This is an absolutely excellent alternative to traditional baked potatoes! It's also exceptionally versatile as a base recipe and can be altered to use any variety of seasonings to suit the accompanying dish. Tossed with seasoning salt was a HUGE hit.

A good side dish to add to any grilled meat or fish.  The precooking is great, ( just don't boil them too long or they will fall apart) then there is no fussing over the grill while they heat and crisp up during those ten minutes or so on the grill.

These were pretty tasty! I halved the potatoes instead of quartering them, but followed the recipe otherwise. I did also skip the last step of drizzling the leftover oil on top; I didn't feel it necessary. Good and easy. Thanks!

So easy. Instead of boiling, I microwaved rwo white potatoes for 2 minutes, flipped them and microwaved an additional 2 munutes. I did the same for a sweet potato but microwaved an extra minute or so and repeated after turning it over. I then cut them in half. Everything else I followed as written. Perfectly crispy when they were dome. I will definitely make these again.

I halved the potatoes and grilled them cut side down for that added grill flavor. No butter needed and the rosemary is perfect for these.

Great way to grill potatoes!  You can do the boiling in water several hours earlier, so when you are the busiest, all you have to do is put them on the grill!  You can change them with various herbs you may have on hand.  I used fresh rosemary.

Microwaved potatoes for 2 min. on each side.  Then grilled as per recipe.  They were wonderful - crispy on outside and soft on the inside.  Next time I will cut potatoes into quarters since we like the crispy side!

We all really enjoyed these! The kids gobbled them up. Quick & easy recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written and added a little butter to the potatoes afterwards. A nice change from our usual mash potatoes.

What a winner. we get so tired of the same ol' baked or mashed potatoes. this gave us another EASY option.  I preped a little different, to make it even easier. I chopped a little fresh rosemary and threw that in my olive oil with some garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and sea salt be for I started cooking, to give the flavors time to fuse. then I took some Yukon gold potatoes, sliced them in half long way and put them in the microwave for about 8 minutes or so. when they come out I use my tongs to roll them around in my oil mixture (whisk it first)a few time then put them face down on a sprayed cookie sheet. flipped them once during cooking. crisp edges, great flavor. they heat up in the oven beautifully for left overs.

Loved it.  I like grilled potatoes crispy, so I skipped the indirect heat and went with 350 direct flame on a metal sheet with our gas grill.   Superb

Grilled Baked Potatoes Haiku: "This didn't wow us. Give me baked 'tater instead. Fun to try new way!" I was already grilling up other things so figured I'd have a go at this recipe too, rather than just baking the potatoes as usual. Took the near-unanimous reviewers' suggestion of microwaving the potatoes b4 grilling, but everything about the timing of the microwaving, or boiling, coupled w/ the grilling, still resulted in seriously underdone potatoes for us. Everything else grilled up great, but the potatoes were a major rock-fest disappointment.

didnt have rosemary so used basil instead.. used yukon gold potatoes.. it was uber yummy.. ty for the recipe.. cant wait to try it with rosemary.. UPDATE: i scaled this down to 1.5 servings (my own math) for three medium russet potatoes.. i used garlic salt instead of powder so i wouldn't have to add any additional salt.. didn't pre-cook the potatoes and placed them directly on the grill.. i didn't measure the oil this time, just added enough to make a paste.. ty again for the recipe

These were fantastic.  We are having a big bbq today, and made 2 potatoes on the grill last night "just to be sure" and they were great.  We have a hard time w/potatoes on the grill. Either overcooked and burnt, or under cooked.  This will prevent both of those issues.  Thanks for this recipe.

I tried these twice before I reviewed.  I would definitely recommend baking the potato for about 15 minutes before putting them on the grill.  I added salt & butter around the skin after the baking but before the grill.  They turned out perfect.

Excellent change for potatoes on the grill - loved the little bit of crunch on the outside!  We will definitely make these again, but maybe experiment with other seasonings as well.

These were very good, and an easily adaptable recipe too for different spices. I used new white potatoes, and this cooking method was not long enough. They needed more time boiling or more time on the grill to get them finished. I will make this again though!

I made these last night alongside BBQ steak and we thought they were just ok.  They don't get very brown over indirect heat and given the added work (as opposed to just plain baked potatoes), they weren't worth the extra effort.

We prefer small Yukon Gold potatoes cut in half...added some crushed garlic, mixed them all up in a plastic baggie and put onto a slotted pan we have for the grill...we use a lot of parmesean cheese, so it tends to get sprinkled all over just before eating

I will definitely make these again. They were easy to do and delicious and were crunchy on the cut side and creamy in the middle. As per some of the tweaks in the reviews, I used medium sized red potatoes and pre-cooked them in the micro for 2 minutes on each side. Then I cut them in half and stored them in the marinade in the fridge until dinner time. They were baked on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes at 425.

Not once, but three times so far.  Great results.  Most guests had seconds.  As left-overs, I used a fry pan and a bit of olive oil.

I substitutied fresh for dried rosemary & brushed the oil mixture onto the potatoes. I didn't used the extra oil after cooking because we didn't think it was necessary. I really liked the crunchy skins. We liked it but prefer roasted potatoes cooked in the oven, cut-up into bite sized pieces; although this is a great way to keep the heat out of the kitchen during the summer. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I make these pretty much as is, except I put them in the microwave for two minutes and I put mine on tin foil with all the spices, cut side down.  Easier and cleaner that way.  Usually for about a half hour on medium, then low for 5 minutes.... no issues with them sticking to the foil as the oil or butter keeps things from sticking.  And they are always a lovely shade of crispy golden brown!

These were great! The only thing I did different was use red potatoes because that's what I had. I really thought of these as an alternative from roasted potatoes vs.  baked. Either way, it kept my kitchen from being hot!

For me 10 minutes was too long for boiling, almost half of the potatoes were too soft to grill, roasted them in the oven instead with the drizzle, reduced pepper to 1/4 tsp and used fresh garlic.

I added half the rosemary and it was still a little much for us. We also turned the potatoes on the grill.  They browned nicely. I would make them again without the rosemary and probably garlic .

Rather than boiling the potatoes, I quartered them, as directed and microwaved them in my microwave potato bag (my sister makes them) for 2 minutes, then flipped it over and microwaved for another 2 minutes, then proceeded with tossing with the oil and seasonings. (Note: the recipe directions do not show the garlic powder anywhere, but just add them with the salt, pepper & rosemary (I used fresh vs dried). I grilled mine in my Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on medium-high grill setting for 3 minutes, then flipped and grilled another 3 minutes. They were great, with nice grill marks. Will make again!

These are great.  I sub in Cayenne instead of Rosemary and I don't boil them.   I cook in potatoe (not cut yet) in the microwave for a little and then wrap in a towel for one hour.  I can do this way ahead of time and then the skin stays on completely.   So good!!

These were yummy and crisped nice on the BBQ. Next time I would use half the seasoning. (We found it a bit peppery.) I also used fresh rosemwary (1:1), because I had it on hand.

We grilled these tonight for supper.  They were okay, but a little strong on the Rosemary, so next time I'll reduce that by half.  When I finished the oil mixture, I thought it was pretty thick, so I sprinkled more oil in it.  We did add a little butter after cooking, just for flavor.  I'll use the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow (cooked with a little onion). Good stuff - can't wait to tweak it.

I made these for a backyard BBQ and they turned out great.  I did get them a bit dark on the bottom which I was worried about at first but it ended up adding some great flavor.  Severed with your standard baked potato fixing and they were a hit!

Simple, easy and delicious.  I popped the potatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes, flipped, and 2 minutes more.  I then sliced them into flats rather then wedges.  I made these changes to hurry dinner along as it was getting late and darkness would soon be coming.  Both changes worked great!  I did season as directed in the recipe and they were fantastic.  Topped with a little fresh chopped parsley and they were enjoyed alongside grilled veggies and a venison steak for DH using 'Emily's Marinated Venison Steaks' from AR.

Delicious, we still added sour cream but wince the rest of dinner was on the grill it was nice to not use the microwave or stove.

Easy to grill and a nice change for a side dish.  I improvised by microwaving instead of boiling the potatoes.  I used a clove of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and  substituted the rosemary with fresh basil. Works well with all kinds of potatoes especially Yukon Gold.

Wonderful! I microwaved the potatoes in the oven for a few minutes as suggested by others. I cut them into plank potatoes and let them marinate. I added 2 tsp. of paprika. Other than that I just followed the recipe.

Really delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and now look forward to experimenting by using red potatoes and microwaving them i/o boiling.  A keeper!

This was awesome!!! We had it for Father's Day. I'm a vegetarian so I basically had these with grilled asparagus.  My husband, my son, and my dad had this with the Delmonico steak recipe on this site as well as grilled asparagus brushing on the same mixture from this recipe.  Heavenly!  Great healthy alternative to baked potatoes or mashed potatoes.

I made this last night using red skin potatoes, to go along with a grilled pork tenderloin.  I was concerned that these would stick to my grill pan, so I actually didn’t grill them, but broiled them.  I started by microwaving halved red potatoes in a little water for 3-4 minutes.  I drained them and blotted them dry, and then tossed them in the oil mixture.  I cut back significantly on the pepper and I skipped the rosemary.  I broiled them until crispy and browned and a little charred on the edges.  I didn’t drizzle the remaining oil mixture over the cooked potatoes.  I would definitely make these again, but next time I’ll be braver and try them on the grill.

These were easy to make and a nice change from regular potatoes.  I thought the recipe called for too much pepper for my taste.

Went great with the BBQ Chicken I made, chicken on the middle of the grill and potatoes in the indirect heat. Super easy and quick with great results. This recipe is a keeper!

Very good!  And very easy too!  I didn't see the need to reserve the dressing--and there wasn't any dressing to reserve, anyway, which is a nice change from too much dressing (which usually happens to me).  I like the flavors and the ease of these potatoes--nice way to do them on the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

I may fool around with this recipe a little to see if I can get a little more flavor from it maybe some garlic powder and Italian seasoning in place of rosemary.  I wasn't impressed with it but I definitely think it has potential.  Maybe some salad dressing instead of the oil.  I'll try it a few different ways and come back with a report.

We really enjoyed these potatoes.I actually microwaved mine a bit to soften them up, put them inside of a plastic zip lock bag with the seasonings. I used some minced garlic as seasoning also. Grilled them as directed and they were great. Previously, I have cooked potatoes this way in the oven and they have been delicious also!

I've tried these twice.  Once with fresh rosemary and the secnd time w/ Herbs de provence.  Made them on the grill and the second time in the toaster oven (our barbeque got rained out).  Extremely easy to make and tastey!

Thanks for the great method - I'd never thought of parboiling and then grilling.  Worked great!  I did use a different spice blend so I can't comment on that part but I am so pleased with how it all turned out.  I'll be doing this often - great change from potato salad!

Didn't think the flavor was great.  I like the taste of the other recipe on this site, that's almost exactly the same, except it uses season salt for it's flavoring.

I will never eat baked potatoes different again.  I used 1 1/2 tsp Herb Provence and 1/2 tsp of Parsley and added to a little sour cream as a finishing touch My wife and I absolutlly loved it.  Thank You!

I followed the other reviews and used red potatoes and the tip about precooking and storing in the fridge until ready to finish...these made nice potatoes without having to heat up the oven that will be great during the summer

Wonderful!  What a way to have that fattening taste without all the fat.  I was surprised, that the potatoes were done enough for me,because I want them done, but they were perfect.  I love the grill taste...
