This is really tasty and the kids enjoyed it. I did use a rotisserie chicken, only one can of chilis (was perfect amount), 2 cups Monterey Jack and then skipped pepper jack cheese and cayenne pepper so it wasn't too spicy for kids. Anything more than what I put in would've been too much for them.  Also I could only find a 14oz jar Alfredo sauce and it was a light version which worked great. Made me feel slightly better about how fattening this is lol. Next time ill just use two cans yellow corn. Beware this is hearty and rich but delicious!

For some reason it came out sweet but after I added curry it was sooo good.

I cut recipe in 1/2, used partial can of Red, white & black beans each & used blush tomato sauce.  I used full recipe amount of Monterey Jack cheese by accident- but loved it. Since I don’t like spicy AT ALL I did not use the pepper jack cheese & only 1/2 can of green chilies- I could not taste the chilies so will add more next time. I used ground chicken & added ground sausage because I was concerned about lack of flavor. I cooked everything on stove top (after browning the ground chicken & ground sausage), onion & garlic) I added the cheese & sour cream about 20m before serving. Really good.

This is a great recipe - terrific as written and flexible enough to accommodate substitutions and additions.  Both my husband and I have made it (we're very different cooks ;-) and it's turned out delicious every time!  We added fresh cilantro last time - it was a lovely addition.

While cooking it smelled really good. When it came time for dinner my husband and I were disappointed. It was just okay. Nothing great and I doubt I will ever make again.  Sure I could probably play around with the spices to give it more flavor, but with what it cost for all the ingredients, I'd rather spend the money elsewhere.

I made this with chicken from a rotisserie chicken, added a T of chicken bouillon, only used montery jack with peppers for the cheese. Everyone loved it! Lots of flavor.

Love this recipe. So flexible. Made it as described with no deviation several times and it is very good. Then decided to experiment. I exchanged the chicken with half ground beef and half Italian sausage. Now, it’s all Italian sausage and upped the cumin and a bit of salt. OMG
