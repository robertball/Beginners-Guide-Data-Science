This pie is the BEST!!  So easy too!  Just a few notes:  

3/4 cup Key Lime juice is = to about 20 Key limes.  I used a garlic press to squeeze the limes quickly and easily (cut limes in half).  

3 Cups of sweetened condensed milk = about 2 cans.  

Perfect recipe!  Impress your friends and enjoy!

I love this recipe. I am from Florida and have had many key lime pies when visiting key west. This is the most authentic tasting pie I have ever made at home. What is best is that it is SO SIMPLE! You can literally whip it up in no time. I used home made whipped topping (heavy whipping cream with a touch of sugar and vanilla) and spread it over the entire pie. I made this for my husbands birthday dinner party. I have since made this pie 3 more times. Everytime we are invited to dinner friends ask me to make this pie for them, it is PERFECT! Do not try another key lime pie recipe on this site, this is the only one you need!

This pie turned out great, I used two cans of condensed milk which turned out to be close to 3 cups. I purchased 20 keylimes which turned out to be exactly 3/4 cup of lime juice. I never got any bubbles while cooking, so I think I ended up cooking it for approx10 minutes before taking it out. Everyone wanted the recipe, so good and easy.

This recipe was my second choice, but should have been my first!!  I made two pies for Easter from a different recipe that called for eggs, and we hated them!  They were dense and heavy, more like a custard than anything, with a bitter lime taste. Then I went in search of a lighter recipe, one without the eggs. This was the recipe I was looking for!! Light, creamy, not too tart or too sweet! PERFECT! I didn't stick with the key limes, (I found the key lime juice to be terribly acidic when I used it in the first recipe) instead I used about 8 Mexican limes that I found in my grocery produce section. They're a little smaller than the traditional Perisian limes, but a bit bigger than the Key Limes. They worked wonderfully! I ended up with 2 cups of juice and used it all for two pies. I used 4 cans of condensed milk, and baked for closer to 13 minutes in shortbread crusts. Topped with homemade whipped cream and YUMMO! Everyone freaked over this pie! I will use this recipe forever! Thanks so much for sharing it!

This was really easy. I used Mothers Oatmeal Cookies as a crust instead of a graham cracker crust. Everything else I kept the same. Really took a matter of minutes, longest part was breaking up the cookies in the blender. I also used Rose's Key Lime juice. EDITED: I liked the combination of the oatmeal cookie crust with the pie filling, I just found the pie a little sweet. I think if I make a key lime pie again, I'll look for one that's creamier and less sweet. EDITED AGAIN: This was even better the next day. I LOVED this pie. EDITED AGAIN: I have doubled the recipe for this and used a homemade graham crust or a pretzel crust and it's always turned out fantastic. This dessert is always a homerun, I've never had leftovers when I make this pie for a gathering or potluck.

My second review after making (and sharing) about three pies. Awesome, awesome recipe, and couldn't be easier!! I found that two 14-oz. cans of condensed milk was perfect - I can't imagine using three. I also didn't bother with the zest and didn't feel the lack. Nice, creamy and tart pie. So good it makes ya want to slap your mamma!

I sat here forever trying to decide which Key Lime Pie to make and finally chose this one and I'm glad I did!  It's so creamy and has the perfect amount of lime and it held together perfectly!  I only added 1 t grated peel, my 35 little limes only made a little less than 3/4 C (boy are my thumbs sore from squeezing those things!), didn't measure the milk, just used 2 cans as others suggested and used reduced fat sour cream.  I made it with the Graham Cracker Crust II from this site since it didn't call for sugar.  I didn't get the bubbles like so many others so I just baked it for 10 minutes.

I think this is a 10 star recipe! It makes a beautiful pie, so simple to make, and absolutely delicious. I made two Key Lime pies, one with egg whites folded in and this recipe. This one stole the show. It was prettier and creamier. I added about 1 1/2 ounce of lime jello for color and flavor but I heard that a true key lime does not have green coloring. I found the key lime juice in the juice section at one grocery store and the liquor section at another. I cannot imagine someone squeezing 20 key limes! I think I baked it for 15 minutes - those pin holes were hard to detect!

I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use 3 cups or 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I used 3 cans though, and I had way more pie filling than necessary.  I also had trouble telling when the pie was bubbling.

The pie was awesome though, easy to put together, and great tasting.  Held up well when out of the fridge for a few hours.  Will definetly make again.

Awesome key lime pie! So easy and so delicious! This has a ton of lime flavor and is so creamy. You only need two cans of sweetened condensed milk and I used light sour cream. I love it when so few ingredients produce such wonderful results! Perfect with a dolllup of whipped cream!

Incredible pie, easy, affordable and tasty! I skipped the lime zest; not needed at all as I prefer a smooth and creamy texture and it already has a lot of "limey" flavor! It took 15 Key Limes, they were 10 for 1.00US here. If you use the larger Persian limes or Mexican limes, you would need much less (3-5 limes) to make 3/4 cup of juice, so do not let the cost of the limes stop you from making this sublime recipe. I often make my own graham cracker crust, but this time I used a Keebler pre-made that states you get "two extra servings" and the total amount of filling was PERFECT for that size. I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk (28 oz. total), rather than 3 cups (24 oz.). I baked it in a pre-heated oven for 10 minutes; there was just a few pinhole sized bubbles under the smooth top layer that did not burst. The pie was set nicely, however, so no worries. Turned the oven off; let it sit there for 1/2 hour and then put it in the frig overnight. Served with cream, whipped with vanilla & confectioners sugar. Total cost was just over $10.00. Worth every penny. This would be a great dessert to take somewhere, it seems foolproof and it was my first time to make it. I would highly recommend even if you think you don't like lime or don't usually make pie. Doesn't heat up the kitchen with that short bake time. Turn the oven on after the limes are juiced, especially if you use a garlic press. It takes just a minute to stir and fold into the crust. Pure yum!

I absolutely love Key Lime pie! This recipe was a fabulous starting point in which I experimented incorporating various suggestions I discovered here to where I believe I've refined it to perfection! Try this: 1 can (14oz) of condensed milk; 8 oz whipped cream cheese (make sure it's of the whipped variety); 1/2 cup (4oz) sour cream; 3/4 cup key lime juice; 1 tablespoon of grated lime zest (definitely makes a difference by adding zing to the flavor); 1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust; 8 oz cool whip.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees farenheit. The substitution of the whipped cream cheese not only greatly improves the flavor but also cuts back on the calaries! You can cut down further using the low fat/lite versions of all the ingredients.  Just put the milk, cream cheese, sour cream and key lime juice into a blender and blend it up. Then add the grated lime zest and stir it around before pouring the mixture into the graham cracker crust. If you're making your own crust I recommend using coconut oil instead of butter. It's MUCH healthier! Use a food processor to crush up the graham crackers or if you don't have one use a ziplock to smash them all up, then place in 9 inch pan, pour just enough oil or butter to allow crumbs to gel while pressing throughout with large spoon. Bake 15 minutes. After cooling in refrigerator for half an hour spread cool whip across the top like you're spreading frosting on a cake. Try this variation and I promise you won't be disappointed!

Pretty good.  Not too sweet, not too tart and I liked that it required no eggs.  I do wonder about the amount of condensed milk it calls for though.  I suppose you could make your own condensed milk, but I think most people use the canned variety.  Two 14 oz. cans are not quite three cups, but result in the perfect amount of filling.  Take the extra time to make a homemade graham crust by mixing 1/3c sugar, 6T. melted butter and about ten sheets of crushed graham crackers (or 1.5 c. of crumbs) and press into pie plate.  Bake for 5 minutes at 325, let cool a little, add filling and bake as the recipe states.  It ended up taking 11 minutes for the pie to be fully cooked.  Perfect with a bit of homemade whipped cream on top.

This was a nice, easy recipe once I got the limes juiced. I used the full amount of sweetened condensed milk. However, when it came to the limes, it took me 30 limes to get 3/4 cup (instead of 20). I wish I had only used 20 because the lime taste was overpowering.

fantastic recipe!   I have made this pie many times now, every time is a success.  The texture is very light and airy (as key lime pies go), and never overly rich or custard like.  It's exactly what a key lime pie should be, which is to say, something different than a custard pie.  The lime juice actually reacts with the dairy ingredients to thicken the pie, so it lacks any eggy taste or texture.  I never have key lime juice when I make it, so I always substitute the juice of three or four mexican limes, and about a 1/3 cup lemon juice.  It's still loaded with key lime pie flavor!  Really perfect recipe.  Three cups condensed milk is essentially two cans and a half cup sour cream is half a small container, for anyone confused.  A note on the cooking,  I normally take it out after 10-12 min, because I've found that it sets a little better that way.   It pairs really well with a slightly brown sugared graham cracker crust and fresh whipped cream!

So this was my first time making a key lime pie and I followed the recipe exactly (except I made my own graham cracker crust). This was really easy to make but I was disappointed with it. The pie was tart and kind of bitter. Maybe less lime should be added?

This is THE BEST Key Lime Pie.  I have people offer to pay me money to make them after they've tried it. I use Key Lime Juice in the bottle and buy only a single lime to grate a bit of peel over the top for garnish - there is NO NEED to torture yourself and try to get the juice from a dozen limes when, having done it both ways, the pies made with the juice from the bottle actually taste *better*!

Live in Florida and have had alot of Key Lime pies.  I thought this receipe was fantastic.  If you have truly never had a Fresh Key Lime Pie, it may be hard to judge whether this tastes like it should.  The taste is right on. I thought it was very creamy and tart in all the right ways, everyone loved it and said it was as good as local restaurants versions.  I would not change a thing - I debated between this and the one with Egg yolks and chose this based on reviews, I am so happy.  A Keeper!  UPDATE: I have made this for work, parties, family - everyone wants the receipe or asks me to make it again.   This has to be the easiest receipe with the biggest results.  You will not be upset.

This is a five star Key Lime Recipe.  One VERY VERY CLOSE to this is Emeril Lagasse's recipe.  The only difference is that it's topped with 1/2 c. sour cream mixed with 1/2 c. conf. sugar.  It sounds weird but it's really good.. I've made it and received alot of good feedback.  Homemade graham cracker crust is alot better than store bought!!  an easy way to improve the pie from the start.  be sure crust has cooled completely before pouring ingredients inside.

TARTY AND EASY! I was a little suspicious that such a simple recipe could be any good, but this is a very good pie. I used bottled key lime juice to save time, but I made my own graham cracker crust and the finished pie was chilling in about 40 minutes. A little whip cream compliments and cuts the tartness of the lime. Don't neglect the lime zest! Those little green bits floating in the filling are what separates the store bought from the homemade.

Hi i am from the uk and have been wanting to make some popular american pies but have struggled to get some of the ingredients needed because they are not available over here! for example key limes! i have researched into this and have been told on several sites that a key lime is actually yellow? anyway i have not been able to get anything of the sort over here so i have used the original green lime , again graham crackers are not in the uk we have the digestive biscuit which is the same and we use this in our cheesecake bases. i prepared everything as stated and it was so delicious ! to be honest i have nothing to compare it to as i have never had it before but it was so good! when done a storn with my family will be using this recipe again for sure! such a easy straight forward recipe to follow. Thank you xx

THE BEST!! Not to tart, and not to sweet. Made for a small gathering of mostly native So. Floridians who have eaten numerous key lime pies over the years. Everyone said this was the best key lime pie they have had, and demanded the recipe. Also used Graham Cracker Crust I and Whipped Cream recipes from this site to make the pie. From reading reviews, some folks don’t seem to know that key limes are quite small (rough size of a quarter) and more tart than the common Persian lime (more pie photos show Persian rather than key limes). Key limes are a/k/a Bartender’s limes; a liquor store may have them if not found at your grocery store. For a bit of trivia, the key lime was predominate in the US until the 1926 hurricane wiped out the Florida Keys and its lime crops. If fresh key limes are not available, the suggestion by others to use Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice is a good one if wanting to make an authentic key lime pie (sold by Whole Foods in S. Florida). My 1 lb. bag ($3.99) had 21 key limes, and made 5/8 cup of juice. A second bag was used to get a full 3/4 cup, and to cut slices for garnish w/ remainder to be used in other dishes. I baked my pie for 11 minutes per suggestion of other reviewers (tiny bubbles were barely detectable when they do appear), and I let it rest for 24 hrs. before serving. Thanks a bunch to Ann Richardson for sharing this wonderful recipe!

WOW!  This was AMAZING! I had never had Key Lime pie before so I had nothing to compare it to but I will never try another recipe for one again because I don't think it could get any better than this and it was so incredibly easy to make! I served it to 5 adults and we all LOVED it!  I used Nellie and Joe's Key Lime juice because there were no key limes to be found and I skipped the lime zest because my husband and I don't like the bitterness it has. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I made the graham cracker crust from scratch which was 1 pkg. graham crackers, 6 tbs. butter and 1/4 cup sugar.  I cooked the crust for 5 min, put the filling in and cooked it for 8 min. I didn't get the tiny bubbles on top until I took it out of the oven.  The pie was very creamy and held together well. I topped it with homemade whipped cream which was 2 cups whipping cream whipped until soft peaks formed, then add 2 tsp. vanilla and 6 tbs. powdered sugar and whipped until ready.  I will be making this again and again!

This was the best and easiest homemade Key Lime Pie, I've ever made!  I recently used this recipe at out annual holiday party and everyone raved about it!  The filling has a very subtle sweet-tart balance, not too overpowering in either direction.  I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, which was almost equal to three cups, and it seemed to be the perfect amount for a normal pie crust, but not nearly enough for a deep dish one - in case anyone was wondering.  I skipped the lime zest entirely, as I was using canned lime juice and didn't have any fresh lime on hand, though I'd imagine that adding the lime zest would definitely give this pie a little bit more of a lime kick.  I topped this with a homemade whipped topping, and it was amazing!  Some reviewers had mentioned that they were unable to see the bubbles on the surface of the pie, I could see them however, in a very well lit kitchen though - so look very closely.  10 minutes tops, no more is needed.  I made this pie two days before it was needed, and it held up well in the fridge.  Thank you for a quick and easy key lime pie recipe!  This is for sure a keeper!

I just made it again, this time I used Plain, Non-fat Greek yogurt (Chobani) and it is probably the best yet!   The non-fat sweetened condense milk version was indistinguishable from regular so this could be a fabulous non-fat dessert for those wanting to reduce the fat in the diet.

I have made this recipe many times.  I just took another one out of the oven.  It is great.  Cannot detect a difference between regular and low fat sour cream so I used the reduced fat version.  The one I just made is my first experiment with fat free sw. condensed milk.

I like to make it in an 8 inch tart pan which needs just 1/2 cup of juice, 1 can of sw. cond. milk, 1/3 cup sour cream.  I always bake it for 15 minutes and just get the tiny bubbles starting to form.  I can't imagine only baking the full size version for 5 to 8 minutes.   I suspect that's what caused the problems for the reviewer that didn't like it and said it formed brown liquid the next day.

Who has this pie left the next day?

Deliciousis Everyone!! ..and so so easy!  I followed  exact ingredients> just going light on sour cream.  My  alter exception was I made mine with a CHOCOLATE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST..and oh my it was a wonderful choice of flavor ~:))..If you're a chocolate lover..try it..you'll love it~:)  I also added more than suggested fresh grated lime rind as I like it real tart.  I topped the pie off w/fresh whipped up heavy cream as my choice!  I served it to my family for our Easter Brunch and it was such a Big Hit with them!!.. they couldn't say enough about it...said it was the absolute best - fresh and flavorful they ever tasted. They also requested that I make it again for again for Mother's Day :) *Note: for those of you who live upstate and have a Wegman's Food Store near you, you can purchase the Key Lime Juice placed in their mixers section & for a good price :).  As you can see I will already be making this wonderful pie again soon as well for other events/occasions to come.  This Key Lime Pie is your Best Choice..you won't be disappointed!  When it's this easy to whip up and the results are awesome..I'm all for it! ~:)

Flavorful, tart, creamy, and easy!  I made my own graham cracker crust for optimum flavor, using the food processor. I did not have a bottle of key lime juice or the wee limes themselves, but I did have 4 large Peruvian limes.  The flavor and zip they provided was excellent.  I served pie wedges to my guests on glass plates that had first been sprinkled with powdered sugar.  A dollop of whipped cream and a twisted, thin slice of lime were placed on top of each wedge.  3-4 plump, fresh raspberries were added to each plate.  Fun, easy, impressive, and delicious--you have to try this recipe.

DIVINE!!! I absolutely love this! I used the 2 (14oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk (which adda up to 3 cups!) and a premade store bought graham crust. I have NEVER had a better key lime pie. It is the perfect balance of sweet/tart and sooo creamy and delicious! I baked for 9 min at 375 and I did see the pinholes! If you are looking for a grest Key Lime Pie recipe than look no further!!

OH MY GOSH - there is a reason this is a 5-star recipe with over 1,360+ reviews.  Add my 5-stars to that total.  This recipe was HIGHLY recommended to me from the morning gals on thebuzz.  I love key lime anything and this pie did not disappoint.  I did not measure out the sweetened condensed milk, but instead used 2 full cans.  That amount plus the other ingredients filled my pie crust to the brim.  I baked for 10 minutes, but tiny bubbles did not appear.  The pie set up fine and cut into beautiful pieces for serving.  I first made this for a friend, and he loved it.  The second time I made it for my extended family, and they too loved it.  I made the first one with fresh squeezed key limes, using my hand-held juicer.  The second time I used Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice.  I really could not tell a difference from one to the other.  This most definitely will be a repeated recipe!!

Excellent pie & super easy recipe!  We're from FL and are very picky about our Key Lime Pie.  I can't tell you how many variations I've tried over the years, and we liked this the best.  As with any recipe - TASTE AS YOU'RE MAKING AND ADJUST.  If you like the filling as is, then you're done.  If you're not happy, fix it.  We like ours on the tart side, so I used about 4/5 cup of fresh lime juice, 1 1/2 Tbs. grated lime zest and 1 cup of sour cream, along with 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk so it wouldn't be too thin.  Juicing hint: if your key limes are hard, microwave them for about 10 seconds, then roll on the counter with the palm of your hand to loosen the juice (zest first).  If your limes aren't yellow, they might be too young - let them ripen on the counter a few days.  Paired this filling with Janaan Cunningham's excellent graham cracker crust recipe.  For planning purposes, pie takes about 4 hours to chill right out of the oven & into the fridge.  I was afraid it would be too thin with the extra juice, but the extra sour cream did the trick & after baking it was perfect.  Some folks like to add cream cheese instead of sour cream - still tasty, but it does change the consistency.

As someone who spent much of his childhood in Key West, I'll have to say that this recipe is a lot easier than the old way.  Had to laugh at the young lady that was disappointed that her Key Lime Pie turned out "tart" and a little "bitter".  If you don't like tart and a little bitter, you don't like Key Lime Pie.

This key lime pie was better than the one we had in Florida!  I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, Nellie & Joe's key lime juice and omitted the grated lime peel.  I made a shortbread crust and homemade whipped topping.  Crust: 24 Lorna Doonie cookies (crushed), 1 T sugar and 1/4 cup melted BUTTER.  Mix together and pat down & up sides of a (slightly greased) 9-inch pie plate.  Bake 325' for 10 minutes.  Cool completely!  Homemade whipped topping:  Beat 1 cup heavy whipping cream until soft peaks form.  Add 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 t vanilla.  Beat until stiff.  Spread over entire pie.  If you love key lime pie, this is the recipe for you!!  You will NOT be disappointed!! Very easy and absolutely delicious!  Truly a keeper!  (Another suggestion is to drizzle a homemade raspberry sauce on the bottom of the plate before serving. :)

This pie is amazing!! I was very skeptical as I  couldn't imagine an authentic key lime pie made with sour cream and no egg yolks. I was wrong. This pie is just as delicious, if not more so, than the traditional recipe. The sour cream makes it a creamier, denser pie without compromising the authentic key lime flavor. My husband and sons, who consider themselves to be true key lime pie afficionados, now prefer this recipe over the traditional one. As others have recommended, I used 2 (14 oz.) cans of condensed milk. I also used Nellie and Joe's key lime juice. For the crust, I used the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site with a few changes to the crust mixture - added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and only 1/4 cup sugar. To any skeptics, TRY THIS PIE!

I made this recipe for a cookout and EVERYONE came up to me wanting the recipe or to compliment me on how good it was.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used bottled lime juice.  I had time so I let in chill overnight. I will make this many times this summer.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!

delicious. Use 2 cans sweetened condensed milk instead (read reviews) instead of measuring 3 cups. I used light sour cream, 1 cup key lime juice (makes it more tart), no lime zest, and a couple drops of green food coloring. Otherwise it's just as written and it's delicious!!  You MUST use key lime juice NOT lime juice.  It makes more than one pie if you use the little metal pans and make your own crust. When I doubled it, it made two pie pans and one 8x8 pan. 

I had to cook it longer (homemade thicker crust I think), but do NOT let it brown.  When the edges start to look shiny and it has thickened some that's when it's done.  It will thicken after it's chilled.  I never had the bubbles pop on the top (the recipe says to look for bubbles), so I just watched it like a hawk.

So very delicious and super easy! I didn't change a single thing and it turned out scrumptious! One thing though, I see lots of reviews stating "two cans of sweetened condensed milk was plenty, wouldn't use three". This is reader error. If you look at the recipe, it calls for 3 CUPS not three cans. And... you are supposed to achieve this by opening up two cans and measuring out 3 cups worth. But really, just use the whole two cans. It will work out perfectly, I promise! :-)

My search for a creamy, tart and just plain delicious Key Lime Pie has now ended with this 5 star recipe. I used 3/4 cup of Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice and two cans of condensed milk.  I baked for 15 minutes and the pinhole bubbles appeared on the top of the pie.  I allowed the pie to cool for about 30 minutes and then placed in the refrigerator to chill for about 6 hours.  This pie setup perfectly and sliced beautifully.  I served with a dollop of  homemade whipped topping.  Thank you ANNRICHARDSON for sharing your recipe.

This is to sweet, the flavors are just all wrong. If you let it sit for a day the things start to separate. You get this watery brown syrup that pools in the spaces. The pie itself tastes nothing like a true keylime pie. I will never make this again.

This is the key lime pie recipe I have been looking for.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  Perfectly creamy and very flavorful.  I made this in a pan and then filled cupcakes and topped them with it for a fun cupcake.  I will be making this again for that purpose and also as the pie.

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit! So easy and yummy! Just as good as the key lime pies you get in Key West! I did run out of Key Limes and had to use a lemon, but my kids loved it even more! Use fresh limes! Its worth the time squeezing!

Hands down best key lime pie recipe ever! I've also used fat free sweetened cond. milk.  You can also make into mini key lime pies using cupcake pans lined with paper cups and homemade graham cracker crust. Make your own crust using 1 sleeve graham crackers, 1/2 cup macadamia nuts, 2 tbsp brown sugar & 4 tbsp melted butter pulsed together in food processor. Pack 1 tbsp into the bottom of each cup, pour 1/4 cup batter on top and bake as directed. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and twist of lime.  You will not regret it!!!

In college I worked in a restaurant that won awards every year for their Keylime Pie.  I knew they used sweetened condensed milk, sour cream and whipping cream - so I thought this came close enough and gave it a try. I only had 2 cups of Sweet Co. Milk, so I did use 1/2 cup of cream to substitute.  I used a home-made graham cracker crust - and home made whipped cream(for a topper).  The rest I did just as is....HOLY COW.  This was beyond delicious!  And it tasted JUST like that award winning pie - only the zest added a little extra goodness.  Thanks!

Made 2 of these for Thanksgiving for something new any they were great.  Note that a 14oz can of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk is exactly  1 cup so if you're using 14oz cans like me it takes 3 of them.  I will say though, all the ingredients together will overflow a standard 9" crust so you have to keep it thick so it can bulge up in the middle.  Otherwise go with the slightly larger crust or waste a bit.  I managed to get it to fit, but it got messy when I tried to reseal it in the plastic cover after cooling for transport; otherwise it'd be perfect.  I'll also warn you that if you zest the lime with an actual zester (where you get longer strips of the zest) it will not break down at all when you cook it and you'll have strands of lime zest in your pie.  Next time I will either try a grater to zest, or I'll chop it up.  And finally, I never saw a single pinhole bubble burst by 10 minutes so I pulled it out.  It was still fine....not browned and set perfectly.

Really good and super easy. A little on the sweet side though. I used regular limes and it only took about 4 to get enough zest and juice. I had a little too much filling in the end (not that I minded eating it plain later). Although it was delicious the first time, next time I make this, I will decrease the amount of sweetened condensed milk and up the sour cream and lime (and make 2 pies, because they go way too fast)

Very easy, oh so tasty and just delightful.
I have found that using crushed animal crackers makes a little nicer crust than graham crackers for any pie using a cookie crust. They don't get soggy under the filling.

This recipe is great. I have been making it for a couple years now and will never use another Key Lime Pie recipe. After reading a lot of other comments on here, I don't understand why it's taking 20+ key limes or so for others to extract 3/4 cup worth of juice. It only takes me 6-8 key limes, cut in half and squeezed by hand, to get 3/4 cup. The key is to buy the dark green key limes and check to make sure they're somewhat soft when squeezing. It will not hinder the flavor.

I also supplement the Graham Cracker crust with my own recipe using Keebler Shortbread Cookies. You will never go back after using this crust recipe. 1 (11.2 oz package) Keebler Sandies Shortbread Cookies, 4 tbsp Butter Flavored Crisco, 4 tbsp sugar. Crush the cookies into a powder using a processor, mix with the sugar and Crisco, and pack it nicely into your pie dish. Bake @ 325 degrees for about 10 minutes before adding the pie filling (then bake again according to this recipe's instructions). It tastes great.

I made this with one can of fat free sweetened condensed milk and one regular, because I had these in my pantry needing to be used up, and used Daisy light sour cream. I accidentally put in too much sour cream, thinking it said one cup. I tried to remove some of it but probably ended up with 3/4 cup or more of sour cream. My mistake turned out to make one of the best Key Lime pies I've ever tasted. Usually they are too tart or too sweet for me. I served this at a party of 14 people and even one person that hates sour cream loved it, and one that never likes Key lime loved it. You can't taste the sour cream in the pie, even with my extra. Every one said this was the best Key lime they ever had.  I did top with light dairy whip cream. I used the larger prepared pie crust that gives two extra servings. Honestly I don't think I've ever made a dessert that got so many raves and request for the recipe. The best part is I hate to bake and this was the easiest dessert I've ever made. Like another reviewer said, about ten minutes to prepare.

It didn't set and it's been a few hours and its still liquid in the fridge.  I took out all of the ingredients and replaced them with sliced pears.  I kept the 2 cans of condensed milk.  Is one of the ingredients the key to setting the pie?

I thought this recipe had a bit too much sweetened condensed milk. If I make this again I will use less of it and a bit less of the lime juice.  It was very sweet and tangy.

I absolutely agree with all the comments about using purchased, already squeezed key lime juice.  Just use one standard lime for your zesting and this recipe couldn't get any easier.  OR MORE DELICIOUS!  I did not get the bubbles mentioned in the recipe when baking, but the recommendation to back for 15 minutes is spot on.  Sets up so beautifully!

I didn't have key limes so I used about 5 regular limes and a heaping tablespoon of lime zest in hopes to enhance the lime flavor. Turned out great! Still very good lime flavor without the key limes.

Used regular limes and juice of 1 lemon - turned out very citrusy and plesant.  Made 12 individual little pies.  Next time I think I would try whipping the mixture a little bit to help 'lighten it up' a little, but other wise, very good!

Very good. The lime zest is super important. It is what gives the pie it's greenish color (not to mention added flavor). If you can't find fresh key limes, please don't use the bottled stuff. No matter what kind of citrus it is, the flavor diminishes soon after being squeezed and can turn harsh. In that case use regular limes. You can add lemon to them if you want.

Have made the egg yolk version of Key Lime Pie many times.  I think I like this version better!  I used "Nellie & Jo's Famous Key West Lime Juice" in a bottle.  Perfect.  Will make this version again.

Delicious! I used 1lb key limes, 2 300mL cans of sweetened condensed milk, and light sour cream. It was perfect! If I had used a third can of condensed milk there would have been far too much filling (I had a bit extra with two). EDIT: I've made this pie a few times now, and still love it! My manfriend thought that it was a bit too sweet, so I made a slight adjustment this last time. I used 2 cups of sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup of plain greek yogurt, and left everything else the same. We reached our perfect level of sweet :) There was some extra filling, so I put it into a ramekin and baked that along with the pie. Note: I've made this pie both with and without the zest, and the flavour is excellent either way. I prefer to add the zest for the aesthetics :)

DELICIOUS!!! I made this using regular limes, low fat sour cream and fat free sweetened condensed milk. I also made my own graham cracker pie crust and sweetened whipped cream from this site. I know.. why use reduced fat stuff and then put whipped cream on it. But it tasted AMAZING!! By far the best lime pie I  have ever had!! Thanks for posting!

Excellent pie! I took the advice from others and also used my garlic press to juice the limes, which worked great! I baked my pie for 10 minutes which was the perfect amount.  Got rave reviews at a dinner party last night!

What have I gotten myself into?  I tried this recipe right before Easter this year as my neighbor gave me a plastic bag full of beautiful limes from her tree.  I think I made about 10 of these scrumptious pies so far this year.  It's almost embarrassing to tell people how simple the recipe is and that I can make it in such short order.  I love everything about the pie and make the recipe as written.  I have always been a huge fan of Key Lime Pie and now I am a fan of this great recipe.  Thank you, Ann.

Easy to make.  Almost too much filling for a 6 ounce graham cracker crust.  Next time I will buy a bigger crust.  Baked it for 12 minutes.  Delicious with real whipped cream.

This pie is not what at all what I expected it to be. I had never made a key lime pie and thought this would be a simple way to start. BOY, was I disappointed! This recipe creates a pudding like pie. I like my key lime with a little more cheesecake consistency. At first taste all you can taste is the condensed milk. Then you have an after taste of lime. If it weren't for my own graham cracker crust I would have probably trashed the entire thing. I have to scrape most of the pie filling off in order to even eat it. I think I will try a recipe that calls for eggs in it next time.

This is By Far The BEST Key Lime I have had since my last couple trips to Florida. I used a whole bag of Key Limes, I cut them into quarters and pressed them in a garlic press something I learned about while reading a cooking magazine. I used 2 full 14 oz cans of sweetened condensed milk. Making a home baked graham cracker crust is fast, easy and makes a world of difference too. Garnishing is simple using a star tip pipping and fresh whipped cream with just a bit of powder sugar to stiffen it up. Adding a single slice of key lime to each piece of pie just before serving gives a gourmet look! This pie is so fast but guests will think you spent hours on it;)

I have made this pie with bottled key lime juice and with fresh key limes.  I found no difference in flavor and of course the bottled is so much easier.  I also prefer the premade shortbread crust over the graham--but, each to their own.  Everyone loves this pie! TIP-don't scrape the bottoms of the cans of sweetened condensed milk, there is gritty stuff that settles down there.

I loved this recipe. I made 2 and it was so simple. I did not use fresh key lime juice, instead I used pre-juiced Key lime juice. I also only used 2 cans of condensed milk... Everyone loved the pie. Initially I didn't say I made it, just to say what they'd say, and when they liked it I said I made it and they were very shocked

Perfect blend of sweet and tangy. Very nice texture, I received many compliments on this one! I made a crust out of shortbread cookies...subtle flavor that went great with this pie.

Blech.  I have to agree with other reviewers that say it tasted like condensed milk and lime juice.  But really what else would it taste like? Those are practically the only ingredients.

Loved this pie!! Added 2 cans of the 10 oz milk and that was plenty (3 cups would have been too much). I also added about 2 tbsp extra of the lime juice. Baked for 10 min!! I didnt use fresh key limes but key lime juice that was from FL and 'all natural'. I'd spring for the stuff thats a little more expensice and not just 99 cent fake lime juice.

fantastic recipe!!  This will be my staple key lime pie recipe from now on.  There is no need to use fresh limes...key lime juice works just as well and tastes great.  The lime zest is a must though.  I put whipped cream on top and a slice of lime and it was beautiful let people know what they were cutting into.

My whole fam LOVED this pie!  I used 2 whole cans of sweetened condensed milk, and now I realize that was a little too much, but it worked.  This came together so fast, and was so creamy and yummy, and cut beautifully.  I think most pies like this need a meringue but this one didn't.  I used one can of regular sweetened cond. milk; one can of fat-free and it still worked wonderfully.  I also used a shortbread crust.

Very good. I took the other reviewer's suggestion to squeeze the limes with a garlic press. It still took forever. And I couldn't get those little things to zest either. So I added a little extra juice. I wish I had taken the extra time to make a homemade crust as the store-bought one did not do justice to the homemade lime filling.

I found this recipe to be a fabulous choice if you want a creamy key lime pie. I used a store-bought graham cracker crust. It only took 7 limes for me to make a 3/4 cup. I used a garlic press to juice the limes, cutting them into 8ths and then squeezing the juice out. I strained off the pulp. It had a great kick to it! I also used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. I will definitely be making this pie again. My husband LOVED it!

This is by far the best key lime pie I have ever tasted. I make my own graham cracker crust and do not measure the sweetened condensed milk, just add 2 whole cans. I have made this pie numerous times. Once when I realized I was out of sour cream I used Greek Yogurt, just as delicious!

This is a great recipe, but for me it was way too sweet. 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk must have the equivalent of 10 cups of sugar in it! I experimented with two ways to cut the sweetness out, reducing the sweetened condensed milk to 1.5 cans instead of 2. In one I substituted sour cream, and the other I substituted evaporated milk (in a 1:1 volume ratio). I preferred the flavor of the pie with the evap milk substitution. Although it made it a little looser, it was still firm enough for a slice to hold it's shape.

I also included a teaspoon of finely ground coffee in the graham cracker crust (which is super easy to make; crush a package of graham crackers and mix with melted butter. Job done!) Really gives it a nice flavor to offset the citrus!

Also, don't look for bubbles because you'll never see them. DO NOT try to cook this for more than 10 minutes. There's no egg to cook here.

Thanks for this recipe!

I was skeptical of this pie setting up given he 5-8 minute bake time, but it was perfect!  I'm still amazed at how good it was and with such ease!  I made a homemade graham cracker crust and added a touch of cinnamon to it.  I highly recommend doing this!

My husband likes key lime pie a lot, so I chose a few recipes from this site to try. Ann yours was the one that I made for him...he devoured it! I added a drop of green food color because my pie looked yellow. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe

Super easy for someone who doesn't make pies!  I have made this pie 3 times in 2 weeks.  The first pie I used 3/4 cups of Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Key Lime Juice vs. squeezing limes (no time/no patience) and left out the zest.  I only used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk (14oz) based on other reviews.  I thought the pie was good, but very, very tart. So I made another one to take to a cookout the next day.  This time I did everything the same as above but cut back and only used 2/3 cup of the Key Lime Juice and threw in a pinch of salt.  To my surprise there was a "Key Lime Pie Connoisseur" in attendance. ugh!  She talked and talked about where the "BEST" Key lime pie was in Florida..blah blah...  So I held my breath when she went for a slice.  She later approached me and said, "That was one of the BEST Key Lime Pies I have ever had!"  SCORE one for ME!  I had many more compliments that day over the pie. My husband who isn't a fan of Key Lime even said, I don't know what you did different with this second pie but it was fantastic.  I think using a little less of the Key Lime juice did the trick, I guess the stuff in bottle is a little more potent then what you get from fresh squeezed.  

Pie #3 was just for my family and YUMMY!  I do like to keep it in the freezer and eat it very, very chilled w/a little whipped cream.

Nellie and Joe's Key West Famous Key Lime Juice; Bakery isle or Juice isle in local grocery stores.

Thank you for a great receipt.

Great key lime pie. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I was really concerned about the sour cream but this pie is perfect. I will be making this pie regularly. 

A special thanks to the genius who recommended using a garlic press to squeeze the key limes. Thank you thank you!

I love key lime pie! Now, I have never been to Florida  so I don't know what an authentic pie taste likes, I only know that I like a mild lime taste with a very creamy texture. This pie was light and creamy. It was a little tart for my taste. If I make it again, I will be adding lest lime juice and zest.

I really like this recipe, it is easy and tasty. I have, however, made a critical change after following the recipe exactly the first time. I substituted half of cup of condensed milk for an additional half cup of sour cream. This makes for a lighter and a little tangier/fresher tasting pie.

Ah ha! If anyone visited the Keg this summer and had their Key Lime Pie and was disappointed when it was discontinued, well, here it is.  I made the homemade Graham crust with a little coconut and sugar.  The second time I made it, I left out the rind and everyone liked it better.  Thank you so much Ann, you are a genius.

This is the easiest.dessert.ever! I usually use Nellie & Joe's key lime juice, but have juiced regular limes (and even RealLime in a pinch) and it still works. You can go without the zest, but it looks and tastes great. Yum!

DELICIOUS! I had to use digestives instead of graham crackers as they are not sold in New Zealand. However, the end result was fantastic. Would definitely make this one again. Probably make it in a bigger pie dish though... I had excess base mixture and filling so obviously used too small a dish.

I have a Key Lime Tree in my yard that is loaded with Key Limes.  I was browsing for a recipe with great reviews and came across "Key Lime Pie VII" with 1,061 reviews to date.  This was my first attempt in making a Key Lime Pie and I was surprised to see just how easy it is.  The most difficult part was juicing the limes which wasn't so bad since I had my husband do that for me.  And the pie was delicious!  This recipe is definitely a keeper that the whole family will enjoy for years to come.

Loved This!  Execellent creamy and tart taste. Easy to make too.  I made them into tarts instead of a pie....I also used a full stick of butter and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk

This recipe is easy and pie turns out great every time.  I have made this for family, friends and coworkers.  I now have a following of people begging for more pie!  One of my friends told me that I ruined him for any other key lime pie b/c mine was the best.  Haha, if only he knew how easy!  I always use fresh key limes and juice them.   A bit tedious, true but definitely worth it.  Serve this with some whipped cream on top and use the "graham cracker crust I" from this site and you will not be disappointed.

I made this over the weekend. IMHO you must top or garnish this with whipped topping to mellow it out a bit. Juicing 20 key limes and grating about 8 was time consuming but worth it. To juice the limes without a citrus squeezer cut them in half and insert a fork and twist and press! If making your own graham cracker crust I wouldnt add additional sugar. Just a sleeve of graham crackers in the food processor with 6 TBS melted butter. Oh and let the pie come to room temp before chilling to avoid it seperating from the crust.

This pie is FABULOUS! I used one bag of Key Limes, which was about 15 limes. A hand juicer made it easier. I went through almost 3 cans of the milk and used regular lime zest. I baked it for 10 mins and let it refridgerate over night.  Everyone loved it. This is the recipe I will use from now on.

What a nice refreshing treat this is! It was not hard to make and the results were fantastic! The filling is so light creamy and smooth. I didn't think I needed to use 3 cans of condensed sweetened milk because there were leftovers after filling up one pie. This will be nice to have this summer as a dessert! UPDATE: My BF loves this dessert, he never tasted anything like this and gave this a 5 stars.

AMAZINGLY GOOD.  And it is AMAZING that this pie sets up, given the amount of fluid and the fact that it bakes so few minutes.  But it did!  And its texture and taste was just delicious.  My husband and I agree that this is better than anything we had in Florida.  Thanks very much for sharing this recipe!

Made this recipe exactly as listed.  You have to like the taste of limes, which many do not, to appreciate this recipe.  It is a fast, good tasting recipe for Key Lime Pie.  Would make again.

Best key lime pie I have ever had!  Even better than the restaurant!  We make homemade topping with heavy cream and add coconut extract and coconut flakes to the topping, nice tropical flavor.

This was the best key lime pie I've ever had (and I'm usually not a fan). I tried it the day after I made it and thought it was too sweet, but I tried it again 3 days later and it tasted AMAZING! I guess you have to let it hang out in the fridge for a day or two to let the flavors come together. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is very easy and delicious.  I followed the directions to a "T" only adding a teaspoon of coconut extract.  I entered this into a pie contest where I worked and it came in second, only because the other pie I entered, a chocolate creme, won first.  Those who ate this pie said it was very authentic, especially with the zest.  Others who don't like key lime pie, said this was fabulous.  It was so easy to whip up, I'll be making this often!

I would give this 10 stars if the rating allowed!  This is the BEST Key Lime Pie I have ever tasted and it's EASY.  I used Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice, I just think it's the best....and you can use the rest of it in anything that calls for lemon or lime juice.

I used the 3 cups of condensed milk, not 2 cans like some reviewers suggested, and it was delicious.  I couldn't find key limes so I used regular limes and increased them to 1 cup of juice and 2 tablespoons finely grated zest.  Perfect tart lime pie and my husband's new favorite!  Thanks!!!

PERFECTION!  Will make this one again and again. I'm not a key lime pie conosour - but my in-laws are, and they LOVED it!  The recipe is great -- I added a little more lime juice (closer to 1 cup). I used Nellie and Joe's brand key lime juice.  And use GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST I off of this site. Perfect.

this recipe is so incredibly 5 star!  i have been making key lime pie with egg yolks for so many years and thought it would be almost impossible to turn out good without them..maybe the wrong consistency with none.  was i ever wrong about that! i followed the recipe to a tee using 20 key limes and baked for 12 minutes.  i did not notice the tiny pinhole bubbles until after it cooled, topped it with fresh whipped cream made with heavy cream whipped with a tablespoon of sugar topped with a sprinkle of key lime zest.  the consistency of the pie was creamy firm and tastes like the best key lime pie i have ever eaten with rave reviews from my daughter and friends. it has the perfect balance between sweet and tart as in 50/50. what inspired me to make my own this time was seeing, are you ready, FROZEN key lime pie in key west from a key lime pie store for $18.95! and they top it with meringue. (yuck) this recipe is the absolute best and i will always use this recipe, and thanks for it!

Hands down simply the best key lime pie you will ever find, I've made this one several times with a homemade graham crust and homemade whipped cream, garnished with paper thin lime slices and lime zest. The only alterations I made were that I reduced the lime zest in half to 1/2 a tablespoon and the sour cream to 1/3 of a cup otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and came out gloriously.

Wow this is the most delicious recipe!  Creamy, mouth watering and slightly tart.  If you have a kitchen aid- I put the final ingredients on medium speed and left for about 4 minutes (darn phone), and it was so fluffy! It had the texture of a light cheesecake.  My husband prefered it to the one I made earlier in the week and stirred about 2 minutes.

Wow, this took a lot of time to make!! Just be warned.  I followed previous suggestions and used a garlic press to squeeze the key limes.  The consistency was great on the pie.  The flavor was too strong!  I love lime, but I think the juice + the tablespoon of rind was too much.  Some bites of the pie were down right bitter! My brother said eating his whole piece was like a dare.  So, would try again minus the rind.  I give this 4 stars since everything else was great and maybe it would be perfect without the rind.

this key lime pie is great, i followed the recipe and it is veeeeery yummy!
a few tips:
if you are making a graham cracker crust, make sure to make it with 2 cups of crumbs... that way you have a thick crust that doesnt break that easily
make sure to bake the crust before filling it with the key lime mixture.. bake for 8 minutes 
let the crust cook at room temperature and fill with the key lime mixture.. put it in the fridge for an hour and then bake for 10 minutes.. I made this with the meringue II recipe on this site.. I preheated the oven and made the meringue, then put it on the unbaked chilled pie and baked for 10 minutes.
great!

This was wonderful.  I'm picky about my key lime pies, and was delighted by the  tart lime taste paired with the creamy sweetness in this pie.  The flavors melded well.  I used two cans of condensed milk.  I ran out of key limes and had to use bottled key lime juice for part of the amount and it was still wonderful.  Everyone fought over extra pieces of pie.

Key lime pie is made with egg yolks. Everybody knows that. This recipe has no egg yolks, so it can't be real Key lime pie, right? That was what I figured, but then I saw the huge number of overwhelmingly positive reviews. So I tried it. And it was great. Light, but not overly fluffy, consistency, with a perfect blend of sweet and tart. It set up perfectly and sliced neatly. 

Perhaps if I tried it next to a more traditional recipe, I'd notice a difference, but I don't know if I'll ever make a more traditional recipe again, because this was so easy and so good. 

A few notes: I used an extra-large, store-bought graham cracker crust. I was worried there wouldn't be enough filling, but there was exactly enough. It would have been too much for a regular-sized crust. Also, I used regular limes instead of Key limes, which my supermarket didn't carry. I found that two cans of sweetened condensed milk was the perfect amount.

READ THESE TIPS before making since squeezing the limes is the most time-consuming part! #1 Microwave 8-10 key limes 30-40 seconds before squeezing. They'll be warm to the touch, and when you cut them open they'll burst with juice, making it much easier to hand squeeze into a measuring cup. #2 Microwave 8-10 at a time but cut 5 open while warm and squeeze while warm. Then cut another 5 open and squeeze while warm. As they cool after cut, it gets harder to squeeze them. While they're warm, the juice just comes pouring out. #3 Don't worry about the seeds until after ALL juice is measured-then pour through a wire mesh strainer or tea strainer. Goes faster this way.   These are my lime squeezing tips because it's the most annoying part. The rest is easy-so few ingredients and so wonderful. Tastes like restaurant quality pie. You'd think you're visiting The Florida Keys! Make your own whipped topping and make your own pie crust please. It makes it mo bettah. I also have additional photos on my blog paulajeancuisine.com

I have made this pie probably 10 times now, it is delicious! My husband LOVES it, and I have made it for his coworkers on occasion too, and they all give rave reviews and ask for the recipe. If you're looking for an amazing key lime pie, look no further!

This pie was incredibly easy to prepare.  I used my mexican lime squeezer for the key limes and it was so easy; even my 9 year old daughter helped me.  I followed other reviews and did 20 key limes and two cans of condensed milk and it turned out wonderful.  Baked the pie for about 8 minutes and sure enough, saw the little bubbles on the very top start to pop but the pie did NOT brown.  Allow it to chill in the fridge all day and there was no leftovers to enjoy the next day.  Served with whipped cream.

I started out making it as written, so here goes. I made my own basic graham crust. I used 2 cans of SCM (24oz = 3 cups, right?) but didn't scrape them out. Mixed in sour cream (full fat for texture. lowfat is more watery), then poured in lime juice. Tasted as I went (you can do that, ya know), and ended up adding a good bit more lime juice and another Tbs sour cream to get the taste I wanted. Baked for 15 minutes, and it came out of the oven pretty firm with a few tiny bubbles on the surface. Chilled it in the fridge for 5 or 6 hours, and topped it with a lightly sweetened, homemade whipped cream to cut the richness. It was delicious! Nice and firm, exactly the light, creamy texture I expect in a key lime pie. Definitely taste the mixture as you blend it, and add more lime juice as you see fit.

I live in Florida and I have a key lime tree I my back yard so I have key limes year round and this is a great recipe and I also like to make candied  key lime zest for the top gives it that special something my husband loves my pies even his work is asking for them he goes to work and they always ask what I am making lately I have been on a homemade ice cream fix I made key lime ice cream who new it would be a big hit just take the key lie pie mix and refrig over night and but into ice cream maker of your choice I use the kitchen aid ice cream maker I make gram cracker crumbles to put on top it is great give it a try either way key lime pie is awesome and I was just looking at some of the pics for this pie no key lime pie is not green and it is made only in a gram cracker crust and do not put whipped cream all over it just some little flowerets along the edge and one in the middle with a candied slice of key lime not a reg lime please this is a native Florida dish and we love are key lime pie and each recipe has been handed down sorry it does take a lot of time to zest and juice these little gems but it is truly worth it and please no food coloring a native Floridian will not touch a green key lime pie because it I fake we all know this the only green should be the zest and that is it.

An excellent result for very little effort. We had Key Lime Pie in Maraton, FL last month and I couldn't wait to make it at home. This recipe tasted exactly as I remembered. I made the recipe exactly as it's written and although I thought it was perfect, others found it was a bit heavy on the lime so I may reduce that to half a cup next time. Also, a tip for those complaining about sore thumbs from squeezing the limes, warm them in a microwave first. It makes them soft and the juices will flow easily when squeezed. Very easy!

I have made several times and this pie is excellent.  Last time, I could not find fresh key limes.  I substituted the 3/4 cup key lime juice with a mixture of half fresh squeezed regular fresh lime juice and half fresh squeezed lemon juice.  It was just as good.

So easy!  I used a ginger snap crust from another recipe because I didn't have graham crackers to make the crust.  Anyway, the ginger snap crust was perfect for the pie.  In case anyone is interested, this is what I did:  Mix 1 Cup finely crushed ginger snaps & 3 T melted butter.  Press into bottom and up sides of 9" pie plate, bake at 375 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool completely before filling.  I loved the tip about using a garlic press to squeeze the limes!  I hand squeezed them just enough to fit them into my garlic press and was amazed at how much more juice I got out of each lime!  Update:  The crust was a bit thin.  Next time I will use 1 1/2 Cups crushed gingersnaps and 4 1/2 T butter.

SO easy, SO creamy, and SO, SO delicious! This pie was a hit and went fast (although, I must say I ate 2 slices, it was that good). Very refreshing desert for a summer party. I wanted to make this easier on myself (I'm a bit of a lazy cook), so I purchased key lime juice instead of juicing key limes myself. I used 3/4 C+ 1 Tbls of the juice, just to make sure there was enough flavor since I did not have any zest. It came out perfect. I baked mine for 10 min exactly, I did not even bother trying to look for pinhole bubbles. Thanks for a super easy (and fool-proof) recipe!

This is the best key lime pie!  So good that no one in our family can eat key lime at a restaurant because my homemade is so good. I follow the recipe exactly except I leave out the lime zest and it taste great without it.  I use the Nellie and Joe’s key lime juice that you can get at the grocery store and it makes for a fabulous pie!

Oh my, this was really yummy!  This recipe has been discussed a lot on the Buzz lately, so I decided I had to try it.  I made my own graham cracker crust and used an 8” springform pan, rather than a pie plate, which worked quite well.  Not wanting to have a partial can of sweetened condensed milk leftover, I used two cans, which made me shy about 1/2 cup, according to my calculation, but it didn't seem to matter.   I ended up baking this for about 10 minutes, waiting for tiny bubbles to appear but they never did.  This set up beautifully and cut cleanly.  In hindsight next time I will bake my graham cracker crust first at 350 for 8-10 minutes, cool and proceed with the recipe.  Also, if you’re using a springform pan like I did, be sure to run a hot knife around the sides of the pan before removing the ring.  This was excellent and refreshing on a hot summer day!

I have made this recipe many, many times, and I am never disappointed.  I do have to admit that I never use the zest.  I did the first couple of times and then got lazy.  I can't say I really miss it.  I use 2 cans of condensed milk, and it works just fine.  I have used regular limes rather than key limes, and again, it works just fine with very little difference in taste.  I would highly recommend it.  If you can talk your sweetheart into squeezing the limes while you work on other things, it's even better. :)

It's a good pie, very rich but not too sweet.  The condensed milk flavour outshines the lime flavour a bit too much for my liking, so I'll try a different key lime recipe next time (one with eggs), but this if fast, easy and good.  took about 13 mintues in my oven before it started to just bubble.

Can't get easier! Great texture and set up perfectly after about 15 min baking. However, I miss the eggs flavor and richness in a traditional recipe, so for another recipe I will keep looking...

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  As suggested I used 2 of the l4oz cans of Eagle Brand sweetened condenced milk.  Omitted lime zest because I didn't have any.  There was too much filling for the 9 inch graham crust so I have already purchased Keebler's graham crust that says 2 extra servings for the next time I make it. 10 minutes in the oven was perfect.

Fantastic.  Just the right amount of zing and sweet.  Super easy; it was gone within hours.  I used regular limes not key limes, otherwise followed the recipe as it stands.

Great Key Lime Pie!  It reminded me of cheesecake, only very easy.  The only other comment I have is that I never saw the tiny bubbles rise to the surface.  I baked it for 13 minutes then took it out so it wouldn't brown.  Topped with whipped cream was really good.  Thanks Ann!

Most key lime pie recipes have an egg base, I was pleased that this one didn't.  There is just a hint of tartness, perfect for my taste. So easy to make that I made two and froze one for later.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe as it is delicious.  Thanks for offering this quick and easy recipe.

Brilliant dessert!  So easy to make!  I made this using regular limes (vs key limes) and it turned out great.  I found it took 4 large sized regular limes to squeeze enough juice for 3/4 cup.

This was fabulous and soooooo easy to do. My whole family enjoyed it, even my son who is a picky eater. Please do stick to the quantity stated for lime juice, I added more because it seemed the sweet had overwhelmed the tanginess, but it came out just a little bit too tart. Will stick to recipe next time, these were incredible :)

Wow, so simple and so delicious!  I read lots of recipes and reviews before deciding on this one, and I'm glad I picked it!  I wasn't sure it would set up enough without any egg yolks, and only baking for 8 minutes, but it really does.  Slices beautifully, so it makes a nice presentation on the plate.  I didn't have the entire tablespoon of lime zest, so I'm excited to try this again with all of it.  I'm sure it will give it that extra lime zing to take it over the top.

I love key lime pie and have tried many pie recipes in my travels looking for that perfect pie. I cooked this pie exactly as written. It did taste very good, however the consistency of the pie filling was very thick and heavy. The next time I made the pie I used the recipe off the bottle, one 14oz can of s.condensed mik, 3 egg yolks, and 1/2 cup of key lime juice.  This recipe was much lighter in consistency which I enjoyed more.

The best ever Key Lime Pie and oh so easy to make.  Living in New England I thought the Key Lime Juice would be hard to find but 2 national grocery stores carry Kelly & Joe's Key West Lime juice.  Made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas and was a big hit.  Several friends have tried the recipe and were amazed at the taste and ease of making the pie.

Absolutely wonderful and I'm not a key lime pie eater!  Followed the other reviews and used lime juice instead of trying to squeeze the limes one by one.  Very, very creamy and sweet goodness!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I couldn't find any key limes/regular limes as it is known here in the caribbean sometimes called the west indian lime as well. I used 4 regular persian limes to make just under 3/4 cup of lime juice. It turned out great and everyone loved it.

WE LOVE IT!!!  Used 1/2 regular sweetened cond. milk and 1/2 fat free sweetened cond. milk- saved a few calories/fat  and you couldn't tell a bit!!   Could not find key limes so I got the already squeezed stuff, also the produce section,  in the lil green bottle.  At 4 oz. each I used 1 and a half of those - that saved a lot of time not having to squeeze the all the limes.  I will do this again using real key limes but I cant imagine it could taste any better!  Also, I'm anxious to try with all fat free SCMilk and fat free sour cream?

I folded in fresh rasberrys to the mixture after I blended it.  Then garnished with lime slices and the fresh berrys. Everyone loved it.

This pie was amazing. Fun, easy to make and yummy! I did add a little more lime juice than the recipe called for because I wanted my filling to be a little more tart but it was a great start. Also, when I stored this in the fridge it was got a little soggy. Still good to eat though. I will be making this again! Thank you!

This pie is AMAZING. I made a super simple home made graham cracker crust and everyone at my dinner party was asking where they could buy the pie. Wonderful and so easy to make!

Yum! I have made this recipe probably 10 or 12 times in the last 2 summers, and everyone loves it! I always make a homemade graham cracker crust, because it's just so easy and tastes so much better than a premade one. The only thing I change is that I use 1 full cup of key lime juice (Nellie's in the bottle) and 1 full cup of sour cream. I lighten it up a little by using light/low-fat sour cream and 2% reduced fat sweetened condensed milk. (I think the fat free is really grainy, but the 2% retains a flavor and texture that is close to the full fat, especially after combined with the sour cream and lime juice.) This usually is enough for a full pie plus I make a few "tartlets" in a cupcake tin  with graham crust and filling, which kids always seem to like!

I just made this.  Fresh out of the oven.  I have not eaten one piece.  HOWEVER, I just licked the bowl. It was FANTASTIC.  I know this is a pie I will be making forever.  And I plan to not tell anyone how to do it!! I left out the zest, I don't care for it.  I used 2 cans, which is less than 3 cups . . BUT my pie crust wouldn't have held more!! But I know it will still be great!  I can't wait for it to cool! Thank you Ann! *update* I thought I could make it better with using homemade SCM, but I was wrong.  The texture is odd.  Only use store bought!

Awesome and super easy!  I even made the crust from scratch (a must!).  No Key limes in sight so I used regualr limes.  I did have to bake it for about 16 minutes; I waited until I saw the little bubbles then took it out and chilled overnight.  Can't wait to make it again.

Super easy to make, for key lime pie! I always try to make individual servings of desserts when I bring them to parties and get-togethers. People are more likely to eat them. So of course, I made these in muffin tins using paper cups to hold everything together until set. Once set, remove the paper cups and set on a pretty plate and serve. Bring a container of whipped topping, and they'll disappear quickly!

I've always been known for my key lime pies so trying a new recipe didn't seem necessary. Boy was I wrong....this is incredible...and no eggs..WOW 
it couldn't be easier and the taste is perfection...not too sweet or tart. Everyone loved it. thank you for giving me a new and improved Key Lime Pie. I made my own crust using gingersnaps and pecans, crushed fine in food processor with sugar and butter. Instead of pie  pan I made this in a 9" springform pan. looks like a cheesecake when done. Also I've tried this with 2 and 3  cans condensed milk, with 2 cans the pie was much more tart. If you prefer a more subtle lime flavor use 3 cans. Either way it is the best and easiest  key lime pie ever.

This was one of the easiest pies I've ever made.  I used bottled RealLime juice and the zest of one small lime. I baked for 10 minutes in my oven (and yes, I saw the bubbles) then refrigerated for two hours before serving.  The consistency was spot on.  The pie is REALLY sweet and rich but hey.. it's DESSERT!  We just cut smaller pieces and are delighted the pie will last longer ;)

Five stars are not enough for this recipie.I didn't have graham crackers so i used a cheese cake base and yogurt instead of sour cream.It took me only 6 limes for the amount of juice that is need it.I have no idea what you girls did with 20 or 30 limes.Here is a small tip for squeezing limes and lemons.Before you do it press and roll them with your palm to soften.This way you can get all the juice out of them very easy.I also didn't get any bubbles so I ended up cooking it for about 20 min.I had 17 limes and now i have 11 left for another 2 pies.I love it.Thank you

I cannot rave enough about this pie, I've made it many times now and it turns out fantastic each time.  It is SO easy and quick to prepare, and it sets perfectly and has a beautiful presentation with just a dollop of whipped cream and a twist of lime on top of each slice.  The flavor is wonderful, with plenty of lime but it is not overwhelming at all, and the texture is so creamy.  I have made it both with and without the lime zest, it does not do too much to the flavor but adds nice specks of color to the pie, although its just beautiful without them.  Be sure to bake it just until you see the tiny pinhole bubbles on top, they are a bit hard to see, so you really have to watch for them.  I have made this pie with both a graham cracker and shortbread crust, and both are wonderful.  This pie is a permanent favorite in our house!

Delicious!  I was taking orders for Xmas and while this was nowhere on the menu (and not exactly the flavors of Christmas in Connecticut), one of my coworkers was just dying for Key Lime Pie.  I changed the crust and used ginger snaps instead, and hit a home run, topped with homemade whipped cream!  This was his quote after one taste: 'Ok...the key lime pie is AMAZING! Julie and I both think it is the greatest pie we have ever eaten!!!! Your crust is so goooooood! I am so glad I convinced (slightly harassed) you to make it!!!!!' This recipe will be in regular rotation!

I wanted to make a key lime pie for my mom, and this recipe looked good. It was amazing. Don't bother trying other recipes ... that's how good this one was. I used a garlic press like others suggested, and it took no time to squish 13 little key limes. Mine didn't bubble, so I baked it for 10 minutes and threw it right into the fridge. An easy and tasty dessert.

I made this for a friend's birthday, and among the praise and compliments were, "This pie is so good I could take a bath in it," and "best key lime pie I've ever had." The taste and texture were absolutely amazing.  The only changes I made were the addition of fresh lemon zest and a dab of green food coloring, whipped cream for topping and cinnamon grahams for the crust.

This pie was one of the best key lime pies I have ever had. It was so smooth and creamy and perfect with whipped cream on top. My company raved about it and I can't wait to make it again - this time with a homemade crust. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk like others have recommended and it turned out perfect!

This stuff is amazing!  I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  My husband's coworker suggested I enter it into the company dessert competition.  It reminds me a lot of cheesecake because it is so creamy, but it has plenty of kick to it with that key lime.  I made it exactly as directed,  except my 20 limes didn't completely step up to the challenge.  I added a tiny bit of lemon juice to make that 3/4 cup mark and ended up short on the zest.  I'm sure it depends on the limes, but next time I think I'll try 30.  Also 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk was just over 2 cans.  I opened up a third can and I'm glad I did - the ratio of lime to cream was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great pie and easy to boot.  I had key lime pie in Florida once and did not care for it.  But with this recipe coming so highly rated, I had to make it for a small gathering.  It was devoured.  I used 2 cans of condensed milk, a small tub of sour cream, and key lime juice from a bottle (in the health foods section of the grocery store) as others had recommended.  It was slap your momma good!

absolutely delicious!! I have tried this recipe twice.  The first time I used 2 cans of condensed milk, one fat free and the other regular and it was AWESOME! the second time I used both regular and it was too rich.  I also used reduced fat sour cream for both recipes and it was a major hit! thanks!

Holy smokes! this was the easiest thing ever. I don't really used condensed milk much, so I was skeptical when you only bake it for 10 minutes and others claimed it set up. Well it did! So stinkin' easy. Ok, maybe not the squeezing lime part, those little buggers are difficult, kept slipping out of my fingers and knocking me in the face. Like others said, 2 cans milk, 20ish limes. Perfect. Guests loved it!

This is the absolute BEST key lime pie I've ever had.  It is definitely restaurant quality...maybe even better!  It's so easy and quick to make too.  I used a store bought graham cracker crust and bought key lime juice.  Don't waste your time juicing all those limes!! I baked the pie for around 12-13 minutes and then just popped it in the fridge to cool.  My husband (who is a key lime pie afficionado) said it was the best key lime pie he's ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!!!  We'll be making this often.

This was my first selfmade key lime pie ever. It turned out perfect! All my guest loved this pie - it was practically gone in no time. My mom already ordered one for her birthday ;) As I am from Germany and had to replace some ingredients as they are not available over here: I used persian limes. You need about 5 to get enough juice, but I used the grated rind of 10.  As they are sweeter in taste I added a dash of concentrated lime juice (Citrovin) to get a "limier" taste. Finally I replaced the sour cream with - literally -  sour cream (I think German sour cream is slightly different from American (less fat)). I topped the pie with a mixture of slightly sweetened whipped cream and crème fraîche (1/4 liter each), stiffened with a little gelatin (2 pieces). This definitely is a keeper!

This is awesome. And so very easy. I do cook it 10-12 minutes, it makes it firmer. The flavor is wonderful. I added cinnamon to the usual gram cracker crust, that's it. Reserved a bit of crumbs and some lime zest for the top of the pie for garnish.  People gobble this up so fast, my stepsons love it when they see the cans of evap milk out and the lime sitting on top of it. What a refreshing, clean, tart taste. You don't normally have this as a choice when going places. I've made it about 10 times since Sept, and will definately be making it again. Its great as it is written.

Key Lime Pie VII - Lucky 7! I followed the recipe with no changes and was very pleased with the result. Great flavor, nice custardy texture, better than the grocery store kind and as good as I have had in restaurants. We tried it chilled and then frozen, and enjoyed both.

I wonder if this recipe can be adapted for different juice flavors. I would like to try pineapple-orange, or orange juice with a little orange liqueur, or maraschino cherry juice in a chocolate wafer crust. Many thanks for posting a recipe that is so simple and delicious!

I loved this key lime pie, and it turned out perfectly--even with some of the changes and substitutions I made.  I used 1/2 c. fresh lime juice and 1/4 c. lemon juice for the key lime flavor.  I was short one can of condensed milk, and so I made my own my heating 1 c. evaporated milk and 1 1/4 c. sugar until the sugar disolved.  My other can of condensed milk was Skim.  Even with fake key lime juice, homemade condensed milk, and skim condensed milk, it was GREAT.  I do *highly* recommend making your own graham cracker crust.

I searched online for quite a while before deciding on this recipe, and it was the perfect choice. I work as a cook at a regional hospital. One of my jobs is baking for the employee cafeteria. I made four of these pies this morning. I always put out a sample piece or two for my fellow kitchen workers to try. They all loved this pie! It's the perfect combination of creamy, tart and refreshing. I only had bottled Key lime juice and fresh regular limes, so that's what I used. I'm looking forward to making this again, but with fresh key limes. I'm also planning on using the same formula to make orange and lemon versions. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Made this recipe but substituted regular limes because key limes were not available and really didn't want to squeeze 20 walnut sized limes. You do need two cans to make 3 measured cups of the condensed milk. The oz measurement on the can threw me off.  Definitely add the whip cream as it makes it so pretty and softens the tart.  It came out perfect, everyone at my dinner party raved.

This is the EASIEST, most IMPRESSIVE pie EVER!  Seriously, the only labor involved at all is the squeezing of the limes, which I used another's suggestion and did it with a garlic press.  (Yields way more juice.)  After the limes are squeezed, you can do the rest in your sleep and in only 8 minutes baking and a quick hour of cooling right from the oven to the fridge, you have a pie that is simply devine!!!!!

Delicious! And unbelievably easy. I used another reviewers suggestion and used a garlic press to squeeze the limes.  It took about 20 limes to make 3/4 cup of juice, and I now know where all my papercuts are. I actually forgot the sour cream (oops!) and it still turned out well.

Awesome recipe!  A few changes:  I used a combo of fresh lime,fresh lemon, and bottled key lime juice to equal 3/4 cups. Also, I used half cream cheese and half sour cream to equal 1/2 cup.  I used 2 cans of condensed milk.  More would have been too much. Everything but the zest went into the Vitamix. I stirred in almost one tablespoon of lime zest.  Super easy!  I made a shortbread cookie  crust  with Lorna Doones cookies.  Baked the pie for 10 minutes like some reviewers suggested and once cooled, refrigerated the pie overnight.  It set up perfectly and very creamy.  This was my husbands birthday dessert and he loved it.

I was excited to find a recipe that did not call for egg yolks and was extremely pleased with the results. The texture was silky perfection. I baked it for 12 minutes and garnished with whipped cream and candied lime slices. Wonderful!

Some time ago I went on a quest to find the perfect Key Lime pie recipe trying many different recipes and eliminating all but one which I thougt was the best.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  My quest is over. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST ANd THE EASIEST!  It Is creamy with the perfect amount of tart & sweetness.  By the way, I use the regular limes and cannot tell the difference fom Key Limes which are difficult to find in my area.

As incredibly easy and delicious as others said. Just make sure to keep it to 20 fresh squeezed key limes and follow another baker's suggestion to use garlic press to squeeze the juice. Only modification was to use 1/2 vs. 1 tablespoon of lime zest. Topping off with whipped cream perfectly accents the pie.

My husband is the cook and baker of the family. Most of the time when I cook I get "it's alright". I made this for our anniversary b/c he loves Key Lime Pie and this is his response: "This is the best thing you have EVER made".  I didn't add the grated lime zest because I couldn't find key limes and I used Nellie & Joe's Famous Key Lime Juice.  Also used a large premade graham cracker crust. It was so easy to make, too. I am not allowed to make it again for "a month or 2" because he just keeps eating it. Every time I turn around he has another piece. Definitely my go to recipe from now on!

This was an absolutely amazing AND simple pie to make! I used homemade condensed milk, regular limes and non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream. That is an improvement in terms of calories and nutrition! (Because it's Greek yogurt the texture is the same as sour cream.) It's a win-win swap for a delicious pie! FYI: It WAS challenging to know when exactly it should come out of the oven however.

Made this earlier today. LOVED IT! The only changes I made was that I used 28oz (2 whole cans) of the condensed milk and I baked it for 10 mins rather than 5-8. It came out perfectly. I didn't have any Florida Key Limes, so I used Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice. This has been added to my recipe box and will be made many more times in the future.

UPDATED COMMENT: Question... Has anyone been able to get the tiny pin holes to appear???? I have made this now about 20 times. I have baked it for as long as 20 minutes and still no pin holes. Thankfully, the pie has always come out very well regardless. Just curious.

My 9YO daughter had a presentation to give on Florida and one of the extra credit points is to bring in a food for the place they are presenting. I found this recipe and I must say, it was amazing!!!! I made a pie before bringing one to the school and brought it to work to test on the co-workers, the pie got rave reviews! I followed the recipe exactly. The most vague part was the cooking time, my daughter and I camped out in front of the oven for about 20 minutes waiting for that perfect bake time. If anyone has a problem with this pie it is because they either cooked the pie improperly or they didn't USE REAL KEY LIME juice. A garlic press is so super helpful for this recipe. 20 key limes made the right amount of juice; zest is essential; I used pre-made crust from Keebler, no complaints on that either.

Super easy recipe and it was a great hit.  The first time I made this, I used actual key limes.  I double the recipe and used 30 key limes.  Delicious.  The 2nd time I did this with regular limes because I couldn't find any key limes and it was just as delicious.  I used a pre-made graham cracker crust.  Couldn't have been easier.  Love it.

This pie is good but in my opinion the 2 cans of condensed sweetened milk makes it way to sweet.  I will try the recipe again but possibly tweak it!

Excellent, didn't change a thing.  However, mine did take longer to cook; but, well worth it.

Great recipe!!  I read everyone's comments prior to making the recipe and I agree with not adding the grated lime zest.  The Key lime turned out delicious without it.  I did however bake it for 10-15min until I saw the tiny bubbles and used 4 limes that made 3/4 cup.  Also, used greek yogurt rather than sour cream.  Just as good and a bit healthier.

I have never made nor eaten key lime pie before, but after moving to a house with a key lime tree in the yard, I decided I needed to do something with them. Due to my husband's dietary restrictions (strict low-fat, gluten-free), I appreciated that this recipe doesn't use eggs. I made the recipe exactly as written, using fat-free sweetened condensed milk and fat-free sour cream in the filling, and fat-free whipped topping. For the crust I used gluten-free graham style animal crackers (cheaper than the gluten-free graham crackers), low-fat butter substitute, and equal parts sugar and Splenda. Like others, I baked for 10 minutes and the pie turned out superb! I doubt anyone would know by the taste that it's virtually a fat-free dessert!

I always thought that Key Lime Pie would be hard to make, but this was so easy to make and I loved it.  I have made about 12 so far and everyone said they like it, so far.  One lady said her husband wanted to eat the whole thing and only left her a small slice.  I am so happy I found this recipe, as I live very close to the keys and I see that the store has these key limes for months now.  Happy that I found fresh key limes every time.  The last time I made it I wasn't home, so the grater that I was using made the zest too large and when you bit into it in the pie, it was too large of a piece of zest, so I would suggest that your grater makes really tiny bits of zest. Tastes better that way.  One time I accidentally used the entire two cans of sweetened condensed milk, and that was just 4 ounces more than the recipe called for.  It still tasted good, but a little milky, so don't make that mistake I made.  Also, one time, I bought the large pie crust at the store, and the pie didn't fill it well, so don't do that either. Buy the smaller pie crust. Also, use real key limes and nothing else.  This is important for this pie. Thank you for this recipe!!!

Gotta love how easy this is!  Have made this pie three times now, each one slightly different, followed the original recipe other than where noted.  1) Swapped 8oz of "whipped" cream cheese in for one can of the SCM per another reviewers suggestion, only 2tsp lime zest - too tart for my tastes since it's missing half of the SCM, but it set beautifully and the texture was great.  2) Stuck to the original recipe - came out very good but maybe a tad too sweet and the texture wasn't quite as nice as the previous cream cheese version [rate this recipe 4.5 stars].  3) Somewhere in the middle; 2 cans SCM, nearly 1 cup key lime juice, 4oz whipped cream cheese and a larger graham crust that says "2 extra servings" on the label (fit perfectly) - Delicious!  Baked all 3 times at 350 for about 12-14 mins, no browning.  Used bottled "Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice" and, couldn't help myself, 1 drop of green food coloring just because I think it looks pretty.  Tried a shortbread crust once, but personally prefer the more hearty graham crust.  GREAT recipe overall that was a JOY to experiment with, thank you for sharing it!

Stop! If you are looking for a Key Lime Pie recipe, look no further. This is the only recipe you need. It is so easy and is tastes so wonderful. I did have to bake it a little longer to get the those tiny bubbles to appear, maybe a total of 10 minutes. But I didn't change anything else and can't imagine why anyone would unless it would to be to make their own graham cracker crust.

Wow, a big bang of flavor! And so easy to make. My husband and I agree that this is the best key lime pie we've had (and we're connoisseurs from Florida). I think the key (no pun intended) is real key limes. I noticed some reviewers who didn't like this recipe were not using real key limes. The lime zest is also critical. And whipped cream. Heaven.

Just amazing. I didn't change the recipe except to use a shortbread pre-made crust. It was absolutely delicious. It had to cook a lot longer than the recipe says in order for any tiny bubbles to surface (might be the crust?). I will be making this again!

Family raved about this pie, best ever. My Aunt said she had tried numberous times to make Key Lime pie, always turned out soupy and lack luster. I took other reviewers advise and used 2 cans of sweetened condenced milk, and used bottled Key Lime Juice. Baked 10 minutes but didn't see any bubbles. The family wouldn't let me leave without sharing the recipe :-)

Awesome recipe, add fresh whipped cream and slivered almonds on top and you have a key lime pie as good as the ones at that famous "public" grocery store in Florida!  I did a test run where I left out the lime zest and used key lime juice instead of squeezing my own limes, and it tasted great, I didn't even miss the key limes (and I've had my share of authentic key lime pie).  Yummm!

This pie was really good.  I decided to make the crust from scratch using a recipe from this site.  It took about 20 limes to make 1 1/2 cups juice - believe me that was the hardest part, squeezing all those limes!  Someone on this site suggested using a garlic press and smooshing each lime half into the press and squeezing it that way, that worked very well.  Everyone asked for seconds on the pie, it was a big hit!

So easy to make.  This pie is EXTREMELY rich and we could only eat a tiny slice.  Super yum, though.  Followed directions exactly.

Wanted something tart & quick & this fit the bill.  I beg forgiveness though as I didn't use key lime juice.  I used standard ol' bottled lime juice & it was terrific.  Using real key lime juice might have been too much for my heart to take.  I also used two cans of condensed milk.  It's a bit more than needed but what on earth does one do with a quarter cup of SCM afterwards?  
I'm using this same recipe to make a lemon pie right now.  Thanks for sharing.

I've been told this pie is the best every time I make it.  My boyfriend does NOT like sweets.  The only thing he enjoys eating and says he could eat every day is key lime pie.  He swears that this pie is the best he's every had, and I have to make one at least once every 2 weeks or else he starts missing it!!  It is the BEST.

I agree with everyone about how delish the pie is, and easy as well, but 2 cans gives you a little more than 2 cups, not three, I had to run out to buy a third to make pie as recipe states,  I do have less than half can left, but hey, 3 Cups is 3 cups, not little over 2.  I used regular limes as well, maybe took about 6 nice size limes.  It looks lovely, nice and full in a Keebler shortbread crust.  And I have a convection oven, and I cooked it 8 min.  I didn't see bubbles either, but I giggled it and it seemed set.  Conv. cooks 5 min. less pretty much anyway, but I did do 8 min. 
Can't wait to try it.  I have made it a few times before but gave them away to friends, this one is mine, all mine.
Enjoy :)

Very delicious pie. The only problem I came across was I was unable to find key limes. So I subbed in half lemon half lime juice with regular lime zest. My husband called it a sprite pie but it was still excellent!

I made this pie for Mother's Day today and it was a hit!! Not a piece of pie was left. My family COULDN'T believe that I made the pie.. I've become officially the BEST key lime pie maker  (in my family that is) the requests continue to pour in from relatives and friends to make them a pie. To think how much money I spent on store bought pies and my pie taste's better!! Awesome recipe!!

Brilliant recipe! This dessert was the star of my Cinco de Mayo dinner. Because I didn't have enough key lime juice, I supplemented with another fresh lime juice and my guests said it was the best they've ever had.

A simple fresh pie that's remained a classic for good reason. I used the 'Graham Cracker Crust I' recipe (a good choice), however I would not have used as much sugar and would have used more zest for that less sweet, tarter taste. I did indulge in a little green food colouring which disappointed the nutritionist in me but delighted the child in me with its dreamy colour.

Really Good! I didn't know what pie recipe to use, so i chose this one because it seemed simple. I froze the leftover pie, and we had it frozen the next day. (really refreshing)

I've tried about 10 different key lime pie recipes and this is the one that's been most preferred by my picky pie-eating boyfriend!  Many other recipes use egg yolks and it seems that something about that addition takes away from the authentic Key West version of the pie.  As other users have said, 3/4 cup key lime juice takes a lot of key limes!  But the result is worth it.  I top mine with a classic homemade whipped cream recipe (heavy whipped cream, vanilla, and sugar).

I followed the recipe exactly and it is delicious.  FYI 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk = 2 cans and 3/4 cup key lime juice = about 20 limes.  I used my garlic press on the halved limes to make them easy to juice.  Yum!

This is the best key lime ever - and so easy.  I overbaked my a little.  I cooked it for 15 minutes because I did not see the little bubbles on the top.  The pie was delicious and sliced beautifully, but I think it would have been creamier if I had cooked it a little less.

This is better than any key lime pie I've ever tasted, restaurant or home-made. And the bonus - no raw egg (which most have)! And so easy to whip up. You may think the filling will overrun the crust, but it piles up nicely and holds its shape.

LOVE this! I have made it once with lime and once with lemon. Next time, I am thinking of making it with triple citrus (orange, lemon, lime). I just love the texture of this, it is super creamy and tangy and sweet in a balanced way. I would recommend sticking with the graham cracker crust, because I tried the NILLA crust made of out of vanilla wafers and it was just not as good. Whipped cream with orange liqueur for topping would be really good, but I haven't tried it yet.

STOP!  Don't even bother looking for another Key Lime Pie recipe.  This is absolutely the best.  I have made over a dozen pies with this recipe and it is still the most requested dessert I make.  It is sweet, tart, creamy, totally delicious, and EASY!

This is the ONLY Key Lime Pie recipe that I'll make.  It is perfect.  I even tried it w/Lite Sour Cream and it came out teriffic.  Instead of measuring out 3 cups of SCM, I just use 2 cans.  Works just fine.   Thanks Ann for this superb recipe.  CathyRae

Absolutely delicious! Fresh key limes were a bit tart and I used slightly less juice than the recipe calls for, and it was still tangy and sweet. A nice refreshing treat!

Served this pie at a dinner with family and friends. It was a huge hit! Everyone said it was delicious, or the absolutely loved it or it was very, very good. No question will do this again. And the best part is that it was incredibly quick and easy to make. I made a homemade graham cracker crust and a hand whipped cream topping with garnish and the entire thing took less then 45 minutes. I didn't get a picture this time but it'll happen again and I'll snap a photo then!

Excellent - I made it with a flaked coconut crust to avoid wheat, lowfat sour cream and only 2 cans condensed milk, and guests ate every bit.  Grate the zest BEFORE squeezing the limes!  Next time I'll buy a couple of big limes for ease in zesting.  There was more filling than needed for a 9-inch pie, so I baked the rest in 2 little custard cups.

This pie is pretty great.  The only changes I made were to use key lime juice in a bottle, no zest, and used a shortbread crust.  Just the right amount or tart and sweet.  I baked for 7 minutes before the pinhole bubbles popped up.  Wonderful pie!

I have never eaten a key lime pie before, and since I wanted to make one for my boyfriend, I wanted to take the challenge and make my very first pie (which I do not have any knowledge of what the taste should or shouldn't be). 

This pie's recipe is so simple but man does it turn out SO AMAZINGLY. 
My only tip for people who are going to try it out is to pay attention to the amount of cream you put into the crust. You want to make sure that it won't over-flow or be too much.

Have fun making this very easy-to-do pie. It is so delicious!!!

Key Lime portion per recipe with great results, even used low fat sour cream and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  For crust used 5 oz. finely crushed animal crackers, 3 tbsp. brown sugar, 4 tbsp. butter, and a pinch of salt.  Simply a winner!

i read so many reviews that said to look no further for the best key lime pie that i did.  and they were right.  every time i make this pie people are amazed by it, especially since it doesn't have any gelatin in it.  good flavor, perfect texture, and amazingly easy.  make sure you let it chill long enough to get a nice firm texture.  i always try to make it the night before so it can stay in the fridge overnight.

Easy and delicious!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  I also made sugared limes to garnish the edge of the pie with the unused Key limes.

Fantantastic!! Great recipe.  I did by 20 limes and only ended up using 6. I'm sure it depends on the size of them lime but i didn't use nearly that many.  I guess i'll just have to make more pies!! =)

Super easy and fantastic!  Takes some time to squeeze those key limes, but well worth it.  EVERYONE raved.  I made 6-4" tartlets and had a little extra to make mini tarts as well - so adorable!  Topped with a squirt of strawberry puree.  Simply wonderful!

EASY, EASY, EASY......I scored 4 bags of Key Limes for $.05 cents a bag!  Two bags equaled 3/4 cup of juice....I ZESTED before I juiced.  Two cans of Sweetened Condensed milk and reduced fat sour cream....Delicious.

Forgiving recipe! I doubled the recipe, then realized I only had 1/2 the amount of co denser sweetened milk I needed. I added a bit of maple syrup to make up for the missing sweetness. I still had plenty of mixture to fill two pies tins. I also substituted my homemade yogurt for the sour cream. 
My SIL said it was the best she's ever had.

I have never eaten/made a key lime pie before using this recipe, and to be completely honest, I don't think I will ever use/eat another recipe, apart from this one, for as long as I live.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!!
Yes, it is incredibly tedious to squeeze all those little limes, but oh-so worth it!  Thanks to a fellow reviewer, I used a garlic press to help with the juicing process (ALL HAIL THIS REVIEWER!!!), and it probably saved me an hour in itself!  
I don't know if it the limes were simply out of season, but I called every single grocery/health food store in town, in search of key limes, and Schnucks was the only store that carried them!  
Regardless, this recipe in to die for, and I will absolutely make it again!!!

Also, I used the "Graham Cracker Crust I" recipe on here in lieu of a store bought crust - the two went together perfectly!!!

Thanks for sharing!

I rarely, if ever write reviews(shame on me) but I was compelled to do so now.  This pie is absolutely scrumptious and far surpasses any of the one's I've had in Key West.  I used 3/4 cup Nellie and Joe's Lime Juice and 2 cans of condensed milk.  My company raved and wanted the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper.

This pie was a breeze to make.  I must have had some juicy limes though because it took only about 10 to make enough juice.  For the sweetened condensed milk I just used two cans.  Tastes wonderful!!  Thank you for sharing!

This was outstanding!!  My 11 year old daughter made it for her first pie attempt, and we were not disappointed. I did take over the lime-squeezing for her...she was standing there for an hour with those little things, doing them by hand!!  AND we used a homemade sweetened condensed milk.  Worthy of more than 5 stars!!

This must be one amazing pie.  I screwed up the recipe and it still came out good.  I forgot the 3rd can of sweetened condensed milk (on the phone and trying to bake at the same time).  I also forgot to stir in the lime zest so I sprinkled it on top.  The pie sat up nicely.  It was really good and no one thought it needed any more milk.  They wouldn't have known the difference if I hadn't told them.  I did make my own graham cracker crust and it was delish with a little allspice in it.  Was out of cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper if you like Key Lime. I've made this for the second time now and did everything right this time. Even BETTER! Be sure to measure out 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk. It will take not quite 3 cans.  If you just pour 3 cans in you will be using too much and it probably won't set up. My pie set up nice and firm. Used cinnamon in my crust this time, also very good.

I love key lime pie and I love citrus flavors. This is the ONLY key lime pie recipe I use now. It's soooo easy to make and very fast. I add extra zest just because I love lime, and when I use the extra-large graham cracker crust pie shell ("2 extra servings!") I can use 3 cans of condensed milk (so no leftovers to rot in the fridge!). I just add an extra spoon of sour cream and up the lime juice to 1 Cup. I haven't been able to mess this recipe up yet, so if you're scared you might, try this recipe. It's totally foolproof and makes me totally feel like a cook :)

This key lime pie is so refreshing!  Other than having to squeeze the juice out of and grate the limes, this recipe is a cinch and takes no time at all.

First time making and eating Key Lime Pie and it was fab! I made my own graham cracker crust and my own whipped cream. 
I did add a teaspoon of vanilla extract because I'm addicted to the stuff and I baked for about 10-15 min (no bubbles ever formed) but other than that I followed the recipe as directed. Next time I will add vanilla bean instead of extract to enhance the flavors.

I was very surprised that the addition of the sour cream made it creamy and dense. I do use bottled key lime juice because fresh is not available where I live.

We loved this pie!  I was happy that it didn't have eggs.  Very easy to make.  Next time I will skip the lime zest.  I have already passed the recipe on to others.

This was so easy!  We loved it.   I squeezed out enough juice in ony 6 limes. Baked it a little too long waiting for the bubbles to surface and burst but it still came out great.  Next time will cook for 10-12 minutes.  Thanks for something quick and easy to make which is great for hot summer night.

Great recipe!

To not waste sweetened condensed milk, I used just  two cans (28 oz) and set the serving size to 6.  (I did this and had the perfect amount of filling).

If you're making the crust by hand, make sure to make the edges high (so the filling doesn't "flood" over the pie crust).

This key lime pie is excellent. Anyone can make this with great results. I used a Keebler premade Graham pie crust. And I used Nellie & Joes Key West Lime Juice. The juice came in a 16 oz. bottle so I will be making a few more pies. 

This pie turns out every bit as good as the ones I buy from the bakery. I will never buy another one now that I know how to make it myself.

Thanks so much for sharing this excellent recipe. It is also very easy to make. It takes no time at all! YUM!

This pie was so wonderful and easy!  I was worried because I had never made a Key Lime pie in my life, but I shouldn't have, it was a no-fail recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again and again....

The only change I made was to substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream simply because I failed to purchase the sour cream as planned!  I made mini key lime pies in small muffin tin for a wedding shower.  HUGE hit!  I made three other desserts and this was the crowd favorite.  Making a 9 inch pie this weekend for my anniversary!  This recipe is so easy and incredibly wonderful.

So easy, yet so delicious. The only thing is that squeezing the juice from key limes was time consuming, but I didn't really mind since it turned out so great:) What a nice dessert for the summer.

This would have been five stars if I could have found key lime juice. I used low fat sour cream and I would just give it a few more hours to chill than the recipe says! Was great!

Best Key Lime Pie...quick and easy recipe.  I opted to make my own crust as others had suggested.  Accidentally used 3 cans of condensed milk so added more sour cream and key lime juice.  Took pie to a party, it was gone in minutes. Everyone raved, thought it was from a bakery. I should have made two.  Took about 20 limes to make 3/4 cup but I soon learned slicing in half and squeezing with a garlic press made the process much easier.

This was not only simple it was delicious! I imagine you can make this same pie using lemon. I made a home made graham cracker crust and baked the crust first then the pie for the suggested 10 mins. Delish! Very refreshing!

FABULOUS! The only thing I changed was I left out the zest. Didn't miss it! This is So Easy and by far the best Key Lime Pie recipe. We have tried a ton of recipes because my hubby loves key lime pie. The search is over. :)

This is an AMAZING recipe. I brought this to a dinner party and I have never gotten so many compliments! I am not a dessert maker, so I was pleased with the easy ingredients and directions. I did find that you need to leave it in the oven for more time. I left it in for about 18 minutes, which is very different from the recipe. Worked perfectly.

This was excellent but I won't be making it again because it was so expensive to make. It was also very easy to make. My 12 yr. old made this for her grandfather's birthday. Thank you for the recipe. If I find the need to make a Key Lime Pie again, I will certainly use this recipe.

This was simple and tasty.  My sour cream had gone bad so I found a substitution chart online and used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I took the pie to a crawfish boil and it was a hit!  It was my first time to make a Key Lime Pie.  Thanks!  Will make again.  The hardest part was juicing the limes.

This recipe was simple, delicious, and eggless!  I have kids with egg allergies so to find something this yummy without eggs was awesome.  The texture of the cake was fabulous, the mixture thickened up right away.  Great recipe that I am sure to use again and again!

Made this for Easter Sunday lunch. It was about half eaten between fourteen people...my FIL commented 'a little goes a long way' about it. I did make some changes....2 cans Eagle Brand, about 1/2 cup of key lime juice and I added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar because my husband said the batter tasted too tart. I took the leftover 1/2 pie to school and left it in the teacher's lounge and a few people asked me for the recipe. I directed them to All Recipes! Overall, a good pie and not a lot of hassle cooking it!

Honestly, I'm a dunce at most cooking/baking. This recipe was sooo easy with minimal ingredients and preparation. I followed the directions exactly, except used slightly less key lime juice than stated. It turned out great, and my mother in law asked for the recipe.

Yummmm! This is the first time making key lime anything, and what a success! Hats off to you guys who hand-squeezed 20+ limes, I just used my magic bullet juicer. :P It was my first time zesting anything too, which I admit was quite fun... 

Didn't change a thing, didn't need to! (make sure you serve this chilled, since mine was out of the fridge for a few hours before it got served, and it was a little soft. But still good nonetheless.)

Amazing pie!! used a heavy half pint heavy whipping cream beat on high with a whisk once it was soft peaks I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup of sugar until it was stiff and used it to top the yummy pie! So happy I found this in time for Easter!

I am lactose intolerant and don't particularly care for key lime pie myself, but my wife loves it so I thought I'd make this one based on the reviews... OMG!!! This pie was SOOOO A-MAZING!!! I got a little of the filling on my hands as I was filling the shell. It was so good, I had to reserve a few spoons to "sample" as the pie set. I made the pie using fat free condensed milk and sour cream, as well as reduced fat crust, so it's not so sinful! Still tastes GREAT!!! Didn't have a zester, so I didn't worry about the lime zest and the pie is still PLENTY limey. 2 cans and 20 limes makes the perfect amount of filling and the consistency was beautiful! Brought a few samples to work and it was a HIT! Thanks to all those who suggested the garlic press. Worked like a charm! One last thing, be sure to use room temperature limes. Next time, I'll try it using homemade crust and whipped cream. Thanks again for a definite keeper!!!

Turned out perfect.  Easiest pie I ever made that did not come from a box.  Used lime juice from a bottle and made a homemade graham cracker crust. Great summer dessert.

First time ever to make came out grate didn't have enough lime juice so had to finish by squeezing fresh limes. Still came out great not very tart so probally a good thing with fresh limes.

Amazing.  I didn't have any grated lime zest so I left it out.  The pie was tangy and perfect in my opinion.  So easy and I can't wait to make it again!

I made this exactly to recipe, but somehow it never firmed up like other key lime pie recipes I have used.  Even my husband commented about this.  With all the 5 star ratings it has received, I feel the fault is me not the recipe.  Anyway, it tasted good!

Everyone loved this recipe but I thought it was a little bit on the sweet side.  This took longer than I thought because it took so long to squeeze all of the limes.  Other than that, an easy recipe.  I actually made it in a square Pampered Chef pan because the only pie plate I had was too small and then I cut it into squares.

Outstanding! Used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk which is close to 3 cups, 20 key limes squeezed in a garlic press, Graham Cracker Crust I from this site, and Paula's Whipped Cream also from this site. Very authentic.

I first made this about six months ago and have probably made 10 since.  It is deceptively easy and never fails.  I always end up baking it much longer, about 12 to 15 minutes, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  If you buy a crust, be sure to buy the 9" or you'll have filling left over.  I also made sweetened condensed milk one time when I was out (see recipe here) and it worked great with that too.

Deceptively easy and impressed all my guests! I made it with a gingersnap and coconut crust instead (1 1/2c crushed gingersnaps, 1/2c toasted flaked coconut, 4T melted butter). I used 2 cans of condensed milk and it was the perfect amount. I highly recommend this!

This is an amazing pie- I would give it more than 5 stars. It is really idiot proof as I have never made keylime pie before until today. I followed the suggestion and reduced the condensed milk to 2 cups, and increase sour cream to just above half cup, and made my own crust.  I had some left over crust material and did mini tartlets using a tart mould. Baked it for exactly 10 minutes (it didnt show any signs on the top but justbake as instructed for 10 minutes)- Perfect!! It was a huge hit at home...definitely a keeper, and tastes better than a lot of restaurant pies.

Made this pie yesterday and it was wonderful.  It's a nice contrast between sweet and sour and the whip cream is a must!!  I substituted the bottle key lime juice made by Nellie and Joe's and it came out fine. However, this is my first time tasting key lime pie.  Quick, easy and delicious!!

Oh my...this is by far the best key lime pie I have ever put in my mouth!  I even made it with fat free sweetened condensed milk AND fat free sour cream.  It doesn't taste fat free!  I will definitely make this over and over again, not just because of the taste, but because it was so unbelievably easy & quick to make!

Very yummy and easy (except for the squeezing part!!) recipe. Loved it! (And it's even good if you substitute lemons!)  I used the Graham Cracker Crust II from this site and it came out great. I also served the pie with fresh whipped cream.

This is an awesome recipe! So much better than any key lime pie I have ever bought from any store. I only needed 15 key limes to get the 3/4 cup of juice, used one of those cheap little manual citrus juicers which is much more efficient than trying to squeeze them with your fingers. Used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, came pretty close to the 3 cups called for. Reduced fat sour cream. Used maby 1/2 tsp of zest only because I was too lazy to grate any more than that. Heated for about 10 minutes, didnt really notice any bubbles. Turned out excellent!! Husband was impressed, he loves key lime pie :)

I'm not usually a fan of Key Lime pie, but I had a whole bag of regular limes that needed to be used up. This is the best rated "limey" recipe for good reason! Followed the recipe exactly (other than juicing regular limes) and garnished with thin lime slices at the end. Yum. I may start eating Key Lime pie now (my own!) :-)

Everyone loved this pie! Super fast and so easy to throw together. Results in a creamy, not too tart, not too sweet pie with perfect consistancy. Baked for 7 min in my oven, cooled on a wire rack until room temp and then placed in the fridge until dinner. This is the only Key Lime Pie recipe needed here. Thanks for sharing!

Delish!  Like most reviewers suggested, I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and it was fine.  I don't know think it would have been too sweet with 3 full cups but you would need the deeper crust because mine went to the top with 2 cans on a regular size crust.  After making and serving this pie a dozen times, I recommend serving whipped cream on the side because some prefer it without the cream (although I love it with!)

Easy and tasty! To make it even easier I used 3/4 cup of 'Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice' and a TBS of lime zest from just a normal lime. The 16 oz bottle of juice cost only $3 and saved SO much time and energy! Next time I will omit the lime zest because the lime flavor was almost too strong. I used "Graham Cracker Crust II" from this site which just took it over the top! My whole family loved this dessert!

My husband said this was "luscious".  I thought it was very good, but quite rich and needed the whipped cream to soften the impact just a bit.  It set up very well and was easy to cut and looked pretty on the plates.  I would serve it for company, with quite a dollop of whipped cream on top and a little grated lime rind to top it off.  Update:  I tried it with just the two cans Eagle Brand and about 3/4 cup sour cream and used bottled organic lime juice.  Flavor was softened a bit, could taste the sour cream just a little more, and was a little better than the original recipe, I thought.  Next time would go back to the 1/2 cup sour cream, still use just the 2 cans Eagle Brand, and if I'm in a hurry, still go with the bottled lime juice, as it was very good.

Easy and yummy--what more could you ask for?  I was a little nervous at the short cook-time, but with a mere 10 minutes, and then chilling, it was completely set-up inside.  I didn't see many "tiny bubbles" in the surface--I wouldn't use that to gauge the doneness.  Just make sure your oven is at the right temp and follow the directions.  Oh, it's surprisingly rich despite the absence of eggs.  1/8 piece is more than enough.

This was delicious and ridiculously easy! I brought it into where I work, since I knew it was my Lt Col’s favorite, and it was almost gone before lunch time. I cooked mine for about 12 minutes because I didn’t really seen any bubbles, and it turned out perfect. Also, I agree with others on this site, definitely use the bought key lime juice!! It’s easy, cheap and deliciously tart. Don’t bother with 20-30 limes, the extra work isn’t worth it. But definitely try this recipe out!

Very good, but VERY rich (a small piece is plenty). Used regular and lowfat sweetened condensed milk, just to reduce calories/fat by a little. Still turned out great.

This is an awesome key lime pie!  I'm from South Florida and I've always made key lime pie with a different recipe.  I decided to try this recipe on a whim, and it's my new key lime pie recipe. My company, husband, and 20-month-old daughter also raved about this pie.  The only problem with it is staying away from the leftovers in the refrigerator.    I found that two cans of sweetened condensed milk was almost three cups, so I just went with that.  The pie was definitely sweet enough.  It did not need a third can!  I also used regular limes due to the unavailability of key limes, and couldn't tell a difference between the regular limes and key limes.  I do recommend adding the zest.  It enhances the citrus flavor of the pie.  It's also pretty.      Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

So easy, so tasty!  I used regular limes, the recommended 3/4 C, used 2 cans of FF cond milk and reduced fat sour cream.  It did take a lot longer in the oven than the recipe calls for.  Can't beat it!

This pie was easy and yummy! I use 20 key limes and had more than enough. Two cans of condensed milk worked great. I might leave out some of the lime zest, it had a slight bitter taste. Lime skins are so thin. I did make a whip cream with heavy cream and some left over lime juice and powdered sugar. I spread a small layer over the top. I will make this again.

Great recipe I didn't change a thing.  I cut the limes in half & used a garlic press to get the most juice out of those little suckers.  I used 16 key limes for 3/4 cup the recipe called for.

This was amazing!!! I followed the directions except after squeezing a bag of key limes (which is hard work) I still didnt have enough juice so I just added lime juice out of one of those plastic lime shaped bottles. It was so thick and creamy!  I cant wait to make this again.

I love to cook, I love to eat and I LOVE this pie! While I've prepared it using fresh key limes I use the bottled key lime juice (Nellie and Joe's brand)as it's much easier to find. Slight difference in taste but still very, very good. I have to cook my pies longer to get the pinhole bubbles to pop. Ovens are different.

Note: two 14 oz cans sweetened condensed milk do not measure 3 cups (more like 2 1/3) but just two cans do work for this recipe. Made one batch in a 13x9 dish--just thick enough; double the recipe if you want the height of a traditional pie using 13x9. Got lots of requests for this recipe after serving it to a group of ladies.  My first time making key lime pie; Key Lime Pie VII rates signature status in the recipe file.

I loved this pie! I made it with two cans of condensed, sweetened milk (one nonfat, one regular) a reduced fat pie crust and lite sour cream. Even with these adjustments, it was a wonderful, creamy pie with the perfect lime tartness. I really enjoyed the texture, light and creamy without being dense or custardy. I highly recommend this recipe. I am a notoriously bad baker and even I couldn't mess it up!

This is absolutely the BEST pie ever! I've never had key lime pie and wante to try it after eating some key lime pie flavored yogurt.  I saw this recipe had the highest number of reviews and figured I'd give it a try.  It was long and tedious work getting the juice out of those little key limes. I noticed someone on here mentioned using a garlic press, I'll definitely do that next time. Like others, I never saw it bubble, but baked it for 10 minutes and then popped it into the fridge.  The first bite was like an explosion of flavor.  Thank you for sharing!!

This was easy to make and pretty. Used a garllic press to squeeze the juice from quartered limes, and that worked well. Still had to use 26 limes to get 3/4 cup of juice! I found it a little too rich and heavy, but I would certainly make this again in mini tart versions for a dessert tray. Thanks!

I have now made this pie MANY times, and every time it comes out perfectly.  I have also substituted lemon juice/zest...great lemon pie.  I add a dollop of vanilla yogurt and use fat free condensed milk and fat free sour cream.  Best with a homemade graham cracker crust.  I would recommend this to anyone!  EDIT:  Will not make this without Greek yogurt again - it adds an element that sour cream doesn't quite cover.  I like the Greek yogurt much better.

Excellent - perfect consistency and so easy! I used a premade crust, but will experiment with a different crust going forward (someone suggested a homemade graham cracker crust with macadamia nuts that sounded great) Elicited rave reviews around the dinner table.  Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as stated. It was AMAZING and so easy! I did use a homemade crust. Graham cracker crusts are so easy that the entire prep was still probably less than half an hour. I used a citrus press for the key limes (a must) and it took about 1 lb of limes. I am still trying to figure out how three soupy ingredients came together to make such a delicious creamy pie. Magic? I don't know. My mouth doesn't care.

This is the perfect key lime pie recipe! Fast (except for juicing the limes), easy, and so delicious.  Taste and consistency were exactly the way a key lime pie should be - creamy, tangy, yum! Hard to tell when it was done cooking, but I left mine in for almost 10 minutes with great results.

So very good and easy.  Never got the pinhole bubbles, so pulled it out of the oven at about 10 minutes.  Took this to dinner party and got rave reviews.  Used bottled lime juice (found it in the juice aisle) and then bought a regular lime for the zest.  This will be a definite part of my recipe repertoire. Edit:  Since writing this review, I've had to go gluten free.  This pie was still a hit-- the only difference I needed to make was making my own graham cracker crust from gluten-free graham crackers!

This does make an excellent key lime pie!  With the cold winter here in FL, 20 limes would have been around $12! This plus the condensed milk and crust ingredients would have cost $20 for the pie!  I used bottled lime juice and three real limes, two for juice and one for garnish. Results were superb. And extremely easy to make.

Amazing! I love that it's lime-y and not overly sweet-- too many key lime pies taste more like condensed milk than lime, in my opinion. I used half lemon juice and half regular lime juice because I couldn't find any key lime juice, and just 2 cans of condensed milk (which is a little under 3 cups). It made the perfect amount of filling for a standard store-bought graham cracker crust, I couldn't imagine needing more milk. I also ended up leaving it in the oven for almost 15 min. because I couldn't see the holes. When I finally took it out I did see some holes, but I had to look really really closely. So don't worry about the holes-- just leave it in for 10-15 min. and you should be good to go. Delicious!

Super simple and really easy.  I would go just a schoosh light on the lime juice.  It was just a bit too tart.  I also had a hard time getting the bubbles out but it wasn't a problem.  I cooked it about 15/20 minutes before I gave up.  Nice recipe. This is a keeper!

YUM! I used a homemade graham crust. I didn't want to squeeze limes, so I used regular lime juice from a bottle (easy!).  Didn't use lime zest.  I baked for closer to 13 minutes - never saw any pinhole bubbles though. It set beautifully.  I then did a 3 eggwhite meringue for the top. I took it to work and everyone loved it!

Unbelievably easy and delicious. My darling boyfriend requested Key Lime Pie as part of our Christmas dinner dessert and we loved this pie. Goes together insanely fast but don't leave it alone in the over too long! Make sure to chill this overnight, it really let's the sweet/tart/creamy flavors blend.

Simply. Flawlessly. Delicious. BTW, I used a shortbread crust as an alternate to the graham cracker crust.  Either way, simply, flawlessly, delicious.  Indeed.

This was a fantastic recipe that was really easy. I did have to bake my pie for a bit longer. I used whipped cream with a touch of sugar to top. Dont go too sweet with the whipped cream it takes away from the tangy lime taste.

A Key Lime-loving friend whose b-day I made this for said it was the best Key Lime Pie he'd ever had.  (Yeah!)  Makes a generous amount of fillng for a 9" pie shell, so you could probably use a larger pie plate if desired.  I had to bake it for 12 mins; could've just been my oven, but be prepared.  Beautiful with whipped cream and a lime garnish!

I made this because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite desserts; I was nervous because he can be critical sometimes.  He was very impressed and I was pleasantly surprised.  A few weeks later, we ate dinner at Morton's Steak House in Houston and ordered their key lime pie to see how it compared and not to toot my own horn, but it wasn't even close!!  I'm convinced we will never order key lime pie in restaurants again; it is so cheap and so easy to do it at home now!  Thank you, justamom!!

I am not a lime pie fan, but I truly love this pie.  As others did, we juiced 20 key limes in a garlic press and used 2 cans of condensed milk.  We skipped the zest for creaminess' sake.  We also used a sugar free homemade graham cracker crust. (Just leave the sugar out of a regular graham cracker crust recipe--you won't notice, and if you do, then you eat WAY too much sugar!)  Phenomenal! Really! We've been talking about this pie for months! (I know, we need a life, but it is really THAT good!)

Sublime, divine, dare I say "perfection"?  This has to be the most awesome pie I have put into my mouth in a long time.  I put the filling into a "nilla wafer" crust, and topped mine w/ homemade whipped cream, (a pint), sweetened w/ 2 TBSP. powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Sublime, divine, and dare I say perfection?  Wait a minute, I already said that! ;)

I've made this pie a total of 3 times now, and I can only say that this is the best key lime pie I've EVER had. The first time I made it, we just sent the limes through a juicer, and it left the pie with a very bitter taste. The other two times, I made it, it turned out PERFECT!! The only thing I changed, was instead of a graham cracker crust, I used crushed Nilla wafers. I've read a few of the reviews that say it was too sweet, or not tangy enough, and  think they might be putting in 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of three cups. It's always turned out just right for me, not too sweet with just the right bite!

SOO GOOD! I used a regular pre-baked pie crust (personal preference) and this pie turned out perfectly. Thank you!

Delicious! Very easy to make! It's also very good with lemons and regular limes (those little key limes are a pain to juice), and picky eaters love it. UPDATE: I've been making it now with fat free sweetened condensed milk and nobody can tell the difference!

Loved this recipe!  This is the first Key Lime Pie recipe I have tried.  I loved the consistancy and flavor.  I left out the rind because I accidentally threw away my limes before getting the zest.  Also, I didn't have a full 3/4 cup lime juice.  Next time around I will be sure to add the zest and the full amount of lime juice to see if that will give it a little more bite than the one I just made.  I loved how easy it was to make!

This came out amazing! Graham cracker pie crusts were on sale, so I cheated and bought one premade. I used 2 and 2/3 cans of evaporated milk, and additional 2 tbs of lime juice (I had squeezed 7 Mexican limes by hand and that was just over 3/4 cup). A tip for squeezing limes: roll them around pressing firmly on a countertop, and when you slice in half, the juice practically gushed out with the slightest squeeze. this is SO creamy and so delicious- you gotta try it!! It hold so well, and set beautifully.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! It has made me a star this summer!  I've squeezed so many key limes I'm about to have forearms like Popeye!! :)  Everyone has loved this pie!!  I, too, used 2 full cans of condensed milk and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Another helpful hint...  If you let the keylimes get to room temperature, it's sooooo much easier to "squeeze" them. Thank you, AnnRichardson for this recipe!  Happy Summer everyone!

Tangy-sweet deliciousness, plus it doesn't get any easier than this.  The hardest part was squeezing all the limes.  Next time, I'll use Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice.  I saw it featured on a Food Network show featuring the Florida Keys, and I found it at my local grocery store.

This is probably one of my favorite recipes on this site. If I could give it a THOUSAND stars I would. Also one of the easiest desserts I have ever made. The only thing I changed was instead of squeezing approximately 20 some-odd key limes I just used key lime juice I bought from the store. My husband and I ate this pie alone in 2 days... We were eating it instead of meals! This pie is dangerously delicious!!! A huge thanks to the poster you just became my new hero!!!

Ok- I like *really* sweet things but this was sooooo sweet that when my guests took the first bite I could tell on all their faces that it was way too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm wondering if next time I will 1/2 the recipe and then fold in some cool whip to cut the richness....  Thanks for sharing though- the actual flavors were spot on I just need to figure out how to cut the sweetness.

Made this reciepe 3 times now.  Very easy. 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and a few extra tablespoons of sour cream fit a store bought 9" oversized graham crust.  This makes for a taller pie.  NICE!  Nellie & Joe's Key West lime juice is much easier than sqeezing limes and has the right balance of tart and sweet.

Super easy & tastes great.  I followed the advise of a previous poster & used a garlic press to juice the limes.  My pie formed the little bubbles on top but did not actually "burst" but I baked for 10 minutes and it was perfect.

If you like "real" key lime pie this is a great recipe.  The 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk that I bought did not make exactly 3 cups so I cut down on the key lime juice just a little.  I used bottled key lime juice and it worked just fine in the recipe.  "Real" key lime pie should not be green as it is in some restaurants.  If it is they have added some food coloring.  The pie should be a very light yellow.  I put cool whip on top and it was delicious.  The cool whip should be put on after it has cooled and been refrigerated for several hours or overnight.  This is a very easy recipe and maybe next time will use fresh key limes that I can get right here in Laredo Tx.

This recipe is a MUST TRY if you love Key Lime pie as much as I do!!  I've made it  with regular bottled lime juice and with bottled key lime juice; both taste good but the Key Lime juice just gives it that little bit of tart taste that you get with a good key lime pie. I took some to work to share with coworkers and they all wanted the recipe.  Thanks!!

This recipe is "good" but incredibly sweet/rich, and tastes more strongly of sweetened condensed milk than a true key lime pie.

I made this in Florida for a bunch of Florida natives (a group very picky about their Key Lime Pie).  The comment I heard over and over was "This is the best Key Lime Pie I've ever had!"  Truly wonderful.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out awesome!! Same as everyone else, didn't see any bubbles so I just baked it 10 mins.  I tasted the batter and it seemed like it needed something else, so I added 2 egg yolks because most recipes called for like 5 yolks. It made the pie the best texture. Just the right amount of lime in it! Will def make this again!

Super easy to make and tasted better than any store bought key lime pie I've ever had.  I live in Florida and have fresh key limes available, so the only change I made was that I fresh squeezed key lime's for the juice and used the zest from the key lime rather than from a regular lime.

FANTASTIC!! For those that want to use up 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk: I purchased the larger Keebler graham cracker crust (the one that says it has 2 extra servings). Adjust this recipe for 10 servings instead of 8 and you will use up all the milk. My pie was perfectly set and delicious!

My First Key Lime pie made at home and by far the best I have ever had, so easy to make and my husband was impressed. I  used 20 key limes, 2 cans SC milk and a small container of sour cream. Baked about 13  minutes it helps to look at the pie from a side angle when baking to see pin holes forming dont wait for too many one or two will do. Used no topping it was great by its self.

Perfect key lime pie, and I've tried lots!  This is my new permanent recipe for this pie, and the best part is, it is relatively light and healthy (used fat free sc milk and light sour cream) in addition to being yummy!

This recipe is delicious and very thick and rich... It wasn't quite tangy enough though. I think next time I will add more lime juice and zest.

This recipe was certainly easy, and I think it came out very well.  I made a homemade graham cracker crust, baked it till just brown, and then filled and baked with the following change.  I used about 10 key limes and 4 regular limes.  It set up beautifully.  The best way to get nice slices is to use a knife that you've run under hot water between cuts.  The slices held together well.

This was fantastic! It was almost too good, if that's possible!!!  I took it to a friend's cookout.  Everyone devoured the key lime pie and were raving about it.  The other desserts were hardly touched.  I kind of felt bad about it.

Highly recommended recipe!  Very easy to make and tasted fabulous!  I have used two cans of condensed milk which was close to 3 cups - but you'll need to buy 3 cans (and find another use for the leftover condensed milk). I couldn't find keylimes or keylime juice so I used 3/4 cup of "Key West" Lime Juice. I never got any bubbles while cooking, so I baked for about 10 minutes.  My FIL prefers it without the zest, a texture issue for him I guess.

this was my first experience making and eating Key lime pie and i must say, it was long overdue. though personally, i dont anything to compare it to, everyone who tried this pie thought it was great. Super easy to make. Two cans of sweetened condensed milk was the perfect amount.  I used the butter cookie crust from this site as i prefer it to a graham cracker crust. Topped with fresh whipped cream. Will definately make often.

This pie is to die for!  Creamy and tart with a hint of sour cream, it has a wonderful flavor!  I was worried I wouldn't see the little bubbles forming on the top (the sign that it had baked long enough), but when I turned the oven light on, I could see them easily (they are tiny though).  I will make this recipe again and again!

PERFECT! There are not words to describe how perfectly this filling tastes. As I was dumping the leftover filling I had in the bowl, I realized I could have made custard cups with it. I was hesitant to try this recipe because most key lime pies are just a little off the mark when it comes to taste or texture, and I really did not believe this one (my first attempt at key lime pie on this website) could be "the one". But IT IS!! To save time, I just used lime juice from the squeeze bottle, but if you were to use gourmet ingredients this pie would be heavenly. You HAVE to try it!!!

I've made this a number of times  and can't imagine a better key lime pie recipe! Perfect balance of sweet and tart for us and so easy to make. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and no lime zest, but might use a bit of it for garnish next time. IMHO, Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice is a must if you don't have fresh limes (which I wouldn't bother with). I use the graham cracker crust recipe from this site that others have mentioned and reserve a few crumbs to sprinkle on top.

I forgot to bake it the first time because my previous recipe was a no-bake one. It was totally edible and yummy, though, but more like a custard. I did bake it the second time and it took about 10 minutes.

UPDATE: I recently made this again for my book club, but used 12 clear glass mini-bowls rather than a pie pan to provide more servings and to look a bit fancier. I only had 1/2 cup of N&J key lime juice, so substituted fresh lemon juice for 1/4 cup. I put a dollop of whipped cream and a tiny triangle slice of lime (blot juice with paper towel) on top - they looked so pretty! Guests raved and all but one consumed every last bite. This will now be my new go-to dessert for company. Thank you for sharing, Ann!
UPDATE: I just tried doubling the recipe (crust too) for a 9" x 13" baking dish. Worked great! Garnished with lime zest and baked in convection oven at 325 degrees for 10 minutes.

My husband made this and didn't put in quite enough lime zest, but it was terrific and we will absolutely make it again and kick up the sourness just a bit.

This is a delicious pie! I made as directed and it turned out perfectly! The only thing I had to do differently is I had to cook it for about 14-16 min in order to get the bubbles to form at the top. Tasted great!

Best recipe ever. I almost make it weekly now for events. I use honey maid crumbs to create base whenever I need, and halve the filling ingredients so it's not overly thick and not as much effort to juice and zest. Will still satisfy a small party! Top with tiny sprinkle of zest, scattered raspberries and some whipped cream decoratively arranged in centre! Perfection.

I changed nothing on the recipe. My family loves it!  If I buy only one bag of key limes, depending on how juicy they are, the juice may vary from 2/3cups to 3/4cups. It tastes great either way. Nice and light. I have tried other recipes with eggs and did not like them.

I made this for Easter. Everyone loved it. It took 20 key limes to get 3/4cup and two cans of condensed milk were perfect for the 3 cups. I put everything in a mixer on medium speed until the batter was fluffy, then poured it into mini pie tins. It made 18 mini pies.

Rich, creamy and delicious. No fail. Yum! I use Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice. For the zest I use a limes or key limes, depending on what I can get my hands on during which ever season.

Everyone loves it. Use the garlic press to get the key lime juice. Previous posts are correct. One bag of key limes and two cans of condensed milk. Fantastic!

Fantastic !  Based on other suggestions, I backed off  a tablespoon  on the lime juice, but didn't change anything else. I've used Joe and Nelly's Key Lime Juice for years and you can't go wrong. I'd give this 10 stars if I could.

Fabulous, light and creamy. I had been using a recipe that called for 6 egg yolks. I wanted to try this. I will never make the other version again. I used light sour cream and another great ingredient to key lime pie success...Nelly and Joe's key lime juice. It has amazing flavor with just the right amount of tartness. Not carried at all grocery stores.  No lime squeezing required!  This is the best key lime pie ever. Thank you!

Based on many of the ratings that said there wasn't enough filling, I added a bit more (proportionally): I added one more cup of the milk (4 cups); 1/4 cup more juice (1 cup), 1/4 cup more sour cream (1 cup).  The only thing I didn't increase is the rind; although I didn't measure it.  I had MORE than what could fit in the pie crust.  I think the other people may have got the larger (traditional) size pie crust--not the nine inch.  Now I have leftover filling, which I plan to use some philo dough inside a cupcake pan and make the rest (I'll probably put some chopped toasted pecans in the bottom).  

At any rate, the pie was a bit hit!  I was asked for the recipe several times.  This biggest confirmation was my man--he is a big dessert person and key lime pie is one of his two favorites.  He insisted that it was fabulous!  Definitely a repeat recipe.  I won't even try to find another.  Although I will make my own crust next time.   Also, I garnished with some wild, freshly picked berries.  Perfect!

OMG! This is the BEST Key Lime Pie I have ever made, and I've made a lot of them over the last 50+ years! As many have mentioned, use 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, enough fresh key limes to give a tablespoon of zest, then Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice for the balance of juice.

This was the best key lime pie I've made and by far the easiest. I didn't have limes so I used Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime juice in a bottle. The flavor was excellent so I won't bother with juicing limes in the future. I cooked for about 8 minutes - never saw bubbles but the pie set up well.

This pie is AMAZING as well as easy!! My husband and his father  love key lime pies, and this has easily been made  a dozen times since Dec. 2015!!! I use about a can and two-thirds of the sweetened condensed milk, and about two Tbsp. more of the key lime juice just because it gives it a little extra zip. Sooooo easy...SUPER DELICIOUS!!!! YOU WONT BE SORRY!

This is delicious!!!  So quick and easy to make.  I have made Key Lime pie with eggs before.  Doesn't compare to this recipe.

Loved it and so did my dinner guests.  Will use this often.

Wow! After looking at all the recipes for Key Lime pie this was by far the easiest so i wasnt sure it would be good. This was FANTASTIC!  Super easy, fresh,  nice lime flavor. I did use fresh key limes that my son juiced by hand and I think that is what gave it that super great lime flavor.

I have probably made this recipe easily 300 times and it's an amazing pie! Canadian condensed milk cans are 300ml, so this recipe actually makes 2 pies using the 300ml cans.

Looking for a key lime pie recipe? Stop here. This is the one. Just go ahead and dump both cans of condensed milk in. This pie disappears quick, but that's ok. It's super simple to make another one. I will use this recipe from now on. It's so good. By the way, I just used regular limes and it takes about four of those.

This is an awesome recipe! Simple but rich in flavors. I used freshly squeezed lime juice and I also blended some fresh mint leaves. You cannot go wrong with all these fresh stuff. I made the crust with 20 Oreo cookies with chocolate creme. It works well with tartness of the lime filling. It took me some time to squeeze the lime juice, other than that, it was a pretty quick and easy dessert. Make sure you chill it for at least one hour in your fridge before serving. Pay attention that pie is a on the tart side of the scale. But that's why I love it!! Super refreshing!

Great recipe! I love to experiment. Try it with lemons, it's wonderful. Oranges are a little bit trickier. You have to condense the freshly squeezed orange juice down about 1/3. Just simmer the juice until it's a little bit stronger taste.  Let it cool before adding. I'm not a graham person so my go to butter crust recipe is 1/2 cup butter, softened, 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup white sugar. Mix with a fork until crumbly. Press into pan and bake for 20 minutes.

This is the best key lime recipe ever! I have made it a few times now using a crust recipe on this site as well. I use much more key lime juice than the recipes says but it really is up the one who prepares the dish- how tart do you want it? For me it is extra tart and we love it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My husband and I thought this pie was perfect.  I actually used Key Lime juice (1/2) and juiced 10 key limes for tartness.  I also bought two cans of condensed sweet cream, even though it fell short of the amount in the recipe.  It turned out perfect-tart with a hint of sweet.   It will be our official recipe for key lime pie.  Thank you for sharing this!

I've made this recipe several times and it is wonderful!  I always use 2 cans of Eagle brand sweetened condensed milk, which is closer to 2 1/2 cups and then add the rest of the ingredients according to the recipe and it works everytime.

Super easy and delicious. I suggest using a graham cracker crust from scratch...they're also easy and delicious! I plan to use a bit less key lime juice & a bit less zest next time....was a tad too tart for me but scrumptious otherwise!!!

This pie was so easy to make and came out so delicious, it was a perfect combination of tart and sweetness.  However I did make a few changes, I  squeezed enough fresh limes that I purchased in a bulk bag from Walmart to make about 1 cup of lime juice and I didnt include any lime zest.  Also I let the pie cook in the oven about 10 minutes The receipe was a hit.  I will be making it again soon.

This is my Go To recipe. Kids love it. So easy too! If I want it more tart, I add more lime juice. 2 cans and 3/4 c. Nellie and Joe's. Perfect!

I was skeptical because the recipe looks  too easy but it was fantastic. 2 cans of condensed milk give you a little bit less than 3 cups if you take a small spatula and take absolutely everything out. I didn't bother opening another one because it seemed like a waste. Besides, my little bag of keylimes gave me about 1/8 C less of what I needed so I thought it would work out, and it did!
I bought the "two more servings"  graham craker crust which is a little bit bigger than the regular one and it turned out to be the perfect amount. I had space to put the whipped cream and it looked nice, not like it was going to overflow. Everyone in my house loved it. This recipe is a winner!

EXCELLENT FAST EASY  Just remember to start a little early to let crust cool. And better to make the day before and sit for the night. So good,  very limy, very creamy. Could not get juice so bought key limes. 20 squeezed with garlic press ,not terrible.
Everyone really liked and so did I, but if it happens a few less limes would be fine. I made my own graham cracker crust and would do again. Check " Noockia Mama" in reviews. I used her
method. Perfect. I used 2 cans condensed milk, did  not measure. Cooked 8 minutes. No bubbles but I did the tapa tapa before. Hoped it was cooked after 8 and it was. This was  
soooo good sooooo creamy. You can't beat this. Great the next day. Iloveit  2nd review.   We ,with company ,did not eat 1/2 of pie.
We went away for 3 days and came home to remember  pie was still in fridge. It was every bit as good as first night. Clearly this
pie can be made a day or  2 before company  and still be fresh if need be.

Delicious! I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk & Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice. Following another reviewer's recommendation, I baked the pie 10 minutes, turned off the oven & let it sit for 30 minutes; then refrigerated it. After the pie was chilled, I topped it with a smooth mixture of 1/2 c. sour cream & 1/2 c. confectioners sugar (another reviewer's recommendation). I served it with a dollop of whipped cream & a twisted lime slice. 
I have had several Key Lime Pie recipes on file but have now tossed all the others. This is the best one!

Best ever!!! Used Rose's sweetened lime juice in the drink mix section of my grocery store. We don't seem to have key limes or key lime juice in Colorado!??. Made two pies for neighbors and they raved about them! I made two for our family. Soooooo delicious it is our new favorite.

I just made this for my dad's birthday and we all liked it! We all think the 1 tbsp of lime zest is too much. I will try half of the zest next time. I also used a store bought graham cracker crust. I let set for 3 1/2 hours and the crust was crunchy...we like a softer crust with this's pie. I recommend to set over night if you have time. I bet it will taste better tomorrow.  When I have more time to make this next time I will try to make my own graham cracker crust with coconut.

I can't believe how simple this recipe is to make.  It is absolutely the best key lime pie I've ever had. I bought two 6-packs of individual graham cracker crusts and the recipe filled all 12 crusts perfectly.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out great!

This is by far the best tasting Key Lime pie I have ever tried.  I had never made one before -- this is super easy.  Hardest part is juicing the limes -- you need about 25 or so to get 3/4 of a cup and it does take a long time, but it's totally worth it.  I used a store bought supermarket brand graham cracker crust and it was just fine. My only complaint is the pie is too small -- I could eat the whole thing!

Super easy recipe. Couldn't find key limes so had to go with regular limes. I think the intense flavour of key limes is critical for best results but if using regular limes substitute sour cream with plain (unsweetened) Balkan-style yogurt. It gives needed tartness to balance the overly sweet condensed milk and mild regular limes... Note: condensed milk comes in 300ml cans where I am, so I only used 2 cans  and it was definitely sweet enough. Made two batches, including mini pies and they were lapped up at my family Victoria Day holiday gathering.... No leftovers or doggie bags and lots of requests for the recipe. My daughter who us a key lime pie fanatic says it's the best she's ever had. And that says a lot! Thank you, Ann and Allrecipes.com!!

Soooo easy and delicious!  I used a 10" pre-made Keebler graham cracker crust and it was surprisingly tasty.  From other reviewers suggestions, I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk vs. trying to measure.  I bought real key lime juice on amazon and it was wonderful and again...easy!  I hadn't zested anything before so I watched a quick tutorial on it and it said to be careful not to get anything but the top layer of the lime - none of the white pith underneath which is very bitter.  I wonder if that was the issue for those whose pie came out bitter.  Baked for 10 minutes, let it cool maybe 30 minutes and put it in the frig for dessert the next day.  Whipped cream and strawberries make it even better.  Really perfect.  Thank you for the recipe!

This pie is so simple, yet absolutely amazing!  Brought it to family Easter dinner and everyone loved it, even the most discriminating Key Lime pie lovers in the family.  I made the recipe as is, using 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, which was perfect.  Key limes were not available, so I used key lime juice (found in the juice section of the grocery store). The juice is made in Florida, and the flavor was wonderful.  I made a homemade graham cracker/shortbread cookie crust which was a great balance to the filling.  Easy to make, 3/4 cup crushed graham crackers, 3/4 cup crushed Lorna Doone cookies, 1/2 cup sugar and 6 Tbsp melted butter.  Bake the crust for 7 minutes and let cool before putting the filling in the crust.  I baked the pie for approx. 12 minutes and it was perfectly set. (we live at high altitude and this was still perfect).  Do take the time use the lime zest, it does add something to the pie.  The next time I make this will be for my daughter's high school graduation party as part of the requested "pie bar".  This pie is definitely a "10" in my book!

This was really easy. 1 3lb bag of Key limes, A lime reamer will give you the 3/4 cup of lime juice. And 2-1/2 cans of eagle brand sweetened condensed milk will equal 3 cups.   I cheated used a Kebler premade crust Next time I will make my own.

Excellent. My guests said it was the best they've ever had. The only change I made was to make my own gluten free crust using a box of K-Too vanilla sandwich cookies and 1/4 cup of butter.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at baking a key lime pie (which is my all time favorite dessert).  I used low-fat sweetened condensed milk and low fat sour cream.   The measurements were perfect, and as other reviewers mentioned, twenty key limes were just right, and I added one  extra for good measure!  Also muddled some fresh raspberries with a little agave nectar for a colorful garnish, and added extra grated zest to make the pie a little more tangy.  This recipe is flawless and there is no need to look any further, better than any slice I have paid for at a fine restaurant in Florida!!  I can't thank. you enough!!!

Wow! This recipe is so incredibly simple, but so perfect. A friend of mine won a contest with her key lime pie. I got the recipe and made it. It was so complicated, time consuming, and way too sweet. 
This recipe with it's 4 ingredients topped the other one hands down. I made my own graham cracker crust as suggested. The only modifications I made were out of necessity and not to perfect something that clearly didn't need help. Since we were snowed in, I used the plain yogurt in my fridge instead of the sour cream and regular limes. Husband couldn't stop eating it. 
When you stumble upon this recipe, don't look any further. Thanks Ann!

Very tasty!  No changes to the recipe and the pie didn't last long.  I served it with whip cream but it's good without as well.

This is a fantastic recipe! I am not a huge fan of key lime pie, but my brother is. I made this recipe for his birthday and I loved it! Very easy to make and delicious when topped with real whipped cream!

First off--this recipe is a winner without any changes to it!  However, I live on a small tropical island where dairy products are not always available, so out of necessity I changed the 1/2 c sour cream to 1/2 c coconut milk and added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the milk and let it sour for five minutes.  I then mixed in 2 T of flour (mixed with a little water so it wouldn't clump) to the coconut milk, 2 cans of sweetened condensed, the lime juice, and the rind, and blended all together in my blender before pouring into the crust.  This turned out amazing!  I love both versions, but the coconut milk really goes well with the lime!

Great recipe. So easy and delicious. However, I made just a small change to increase the tartness: Instead of 3/4 cup lime juice, substitute 1/2 cup Nellie & Joes Key Lime Juice plus 1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon.

EASY AND DELICIOUS! Sweet,  light but creamy and utterly amazing.  My favorite and better than most restaurant pie I find if you make with homemade Graham cracker crust! I sometimes use a cupcake pan and make mini-pies for individual servings but warning: one is never eough.   PS- I've made this pie many times and it's never bubbled.

Perfect.  Will use this recipe forever.

To those who found it bitter... it may just not be sweet enough for you but, the rind will make it bitter if you zest below the color of the fruit, in this case, lime.  Lightly zest so you just scratch the green off and don't get any white below the green into your zest mix. Within reason, of course. Obviously some may get in but, key limes are so small that zesting one is quick business and it is easy to scrape too many times.

This is the best key lime pie. Must use key limes. Garlic press works great to squeeze limes. I substituted crust using a homemade vanilla wafer crust (1.5cup food processed waffers & 2/3 cup melted butter).

My significant other is from Florida and when I asked him what kind of dessert he wanted for Thanksgiving he requested Key Lime Pie. I'd never tasted or made a key lime pie before so was extremely nervous. Read all the reviews here and chose this recipe which I followed exactly as it was written. Everyone raved about it, it was hands down the favorite pie on the dessert table and super easy to make. He said it came out perfect! I will definitely be making this pie again!

This was the best key lime pie I have ever made! I made my own graham cracker crust, and freshly squeezed key limes. The batter seemed rather runny, and I was worried it couldn't possibly set up into a nice consistency, but after 10 minutes of baking, and a few hours of chilling in the fridge, it was perfect! Our dinner guests raved about this dessert!

I don't think that I have ever had key lime pie before so I don't have anything to compare this recipe to, but I thought it was delicious.  My girls and I had a good time squeezing the limes.  I'm a little surprised that so many people said 3/4 cup of key lime juice was the equivalent if about 20 limes.  I used ten and it was exactly 3/4 cup.  A little hint to getting the most out juice out of your citrus fruit... Roll it on the counter a few times to break up the pulp.  :)

This was great! I bought a bag of Keylime's at Walmart. There were 24 of them so I thought I would have plenty to get 3/4 c Worth...but maybe they were on the smaller side because I only managed to get half a cup. However this still came out awesome!!! So worth the effort of squeezing and grating!

So easy and SO DELICIOUS and rich and creamy. Doesn't even need Cool Whip. The only thing I had an issue with was cook time - it did not seem to change/"set" when I baked it for the 5-8 minutes and I probably ended up baking it around 15 or more minutes to get the little bubbles on the surface. I use Nellie & Joe's key lime juice which comes in a bottle and they have at my local Giant. I usually leave out the lime zest since I don't have a microplane and it's still delicious!

I have made this pie several times. I use 600 ml. (2 cans) of sweetened condensed milk and 5/8 of a cup of sour cream, plus the 3/4 cup of fresh lime juice and the zest of 1 lime. Everyone that has eaten this pie has admitted that it is the best key lime pie they have ever eaten.

I made this key lime pie recipe exactly as described, except I made a homemade crust to go under it.  It's absolutely delish; very sweet and very tart at the same time.  Highly recommend if you are a hankering for key lime pie.  In case you are wondering, there is a difference between key lime juice and just regular lime juice.  Don't make this pie without the key lime juice, or it will be lacking some of the tartness one would expect.

It's very rare that I come across a recipe that's both a. Absolutely delicious and b. unbelievably easy to make. This is that recipe. (especially if you cheat like me and use a premade graham crust!)
I found the amount of lime juice to be perfect. I didn't add zest to the filling because I thought the juice was enough upon tasting, but I did make some whipped cream with sugar, a dash of lime juice and vanilla and then grated some zest on top of that. I also garnished the pie with little lime slices.
I used Nellie and Joe's bottled key lime juice....Jewel Osco carries it. :)

Fantastic and exactly what I wanted. I used 3 cans of the milk, but did not scrape the sides with a spatula. I also did not get bubbles after baking for 13 minutes. I took it out cooled it and it was delicious.

So simple that my 10 year old could make it!! In fact she did! This was delicious. I was expecting it not to be sweet enough because there's no sugar, but it was perfect. We made individual pies in little pots and this recipe made 9 individual desserts. I kept all ingredients and quantities the same

I had an old store purchased graham cracker crust lying around, so I decided to see what I can do to use it up; I found this really simple recipe, and after reading the reviews, decided to go for it. I went to three (3) different stores to source key limes -- no luck, so I settled for regular limes. It took five limes for me to get 3/4 C. of juice, and thanks to other reviewers, I knew to use two (2) scans of sweetened condensed milk. Acid test -- we just had it for dessert; Daughter said "its GOOD, Mama!", and Husband practically inhaled it. I'm going to savor mine after sending this review. Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe -- I like hitting the "easy" button when it comes to cooking. This recipe delivers!

My family enjoyed this pie very much but it's  a little bit rich for me. The preparation couldn't get much easier though. It took four Persian limes to get 3/4 cup of lime juice and the zest from two to get a tablespoon full.  **note to Michellica: your pie could have turned out bitter if you included the soft, spongy part (the pith) of the lime when taking the zest off the limes. The pith tends to be quite bitter. You want only the deep green part of the skin, the part right at the surface.

Fabulous pie and I love that this one doesn't have eggs since I'm not an egg fan and could always taste the eggs in other key lime pies.  I used my own graham cracker crust (1 sleeve graham crackers, 4 tbsp melted butter, 2 tbsp sugar, pinch salt) in my deep dish pie pan and baked it for 10 minutes.  The 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk equals 2.5 cans.  I used the bottled Nellie and Joe's Key lime juice.  This is a perfect key lime pie!

After several days, the lime zest actually brightens in flavor and improves this sugary depth of this easy pie, as does a fresh blueberry topping. I like the rich pudding texture that many reviewers complained about.

Easiest and best recipe!  Why would you make it more complicated when you don't have to?  I would probably add more zest next time just for more zing, but this recipe is perfect.  I doubled the amounts for two pies.

Tried this wonderful recipe when my son & daughter-in-law visited recently. It was the perfect sweet for our cookout.  Quick, easy & full of lovely lime flavor, tart but not too sour.  I should note that for several years my hubby & I traveled annually to South Florida to a work related conference.  Every year we tried key lime pie each evening at a different place searching for the best.  Too many places try to pawn off lime cheesecake, which is good but it's not key lime pie.  This makes the sort of pie we looked for.  Thanks so much for sharing it!!!  Deb from Missouri

This was my very first attempt at Key Lime Pie. It turned out GREAT! It was so easy! I used key lime juice and then added the juice 2 additional fresh limes.  It was so fresh and light!  I did have to cook it for 10 minutes vs the 5-8 called for in the recipe. This has turned into a family favorite!

Easy,  good flavor and texture.  Still works if you replace plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and real limes or bottled lime juice.   Any way I have made it it has been easy and excellent

Having tasted the best ever key lime pie whilst on holiday last year in Key Largo, I have tried to replicate many times for my family as we live in London UK, Thanks heavens this is the recipe Ive been looking for! Not only does it taste sublime it is quick and easy. We don't have key limes here so 10 regular limes worked well (about twice the size of key limes) Like many others I trawled the internet trying different ones with eggs etc. Its a keeper recipe and I will make this time and time again Im sure for my family.

Made this for my husband's birthday and we both LOVED it!  I didn't have a zester, so I tried using a potato peeler and a paring knife to get the zest, but it was not working well.  So, there was not even an 1/8 of a teaspoon of zest, and the pie still turned out delicious.  This pie is heavy, sweet and slightly tart ... the way we like it. For some reason, I had to use close to 40 key limes to get the right amount of juice.  And, I made this with the homemade Whipped Cream by Paula. P.S. Buy three cans of condensed milk as others say.  Two cans do not equal three cups, and three cups do not overflow the store-bought Keebler graham cracker crust.

My go-to dessert recipe! I'm a college kid who likes the idea of baking and cooking, but never really had lessons from my mom on how to do either. I love key lime pie so I googled recipes and found this one. I chose it based on the high reviews, ease, and small amount of ingredients (because it's annoying to buy things that you'll use only once, especially as a student buying groceries for one). I have made it twice before and currently have one chilling in the freezer as my boyfriend *patiently* waits for it to cool off. If you try this recipe, you won't regret it. It's the deliciousness of a difficult recipe, but SO EASY.

This recipe is so good. Everyone always loves it. I made homemade topping with heavy whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla. If you want to make it over the top homemade and awesome. Make your own crust with 2 pkgs of crushed graham crackers, 1/2-1 cup sugar depending on your taste, and 1 1/2 sticks melted butter. Best ever!!!! You will totally wow your friends and family!!!

I too followed the directions almost to a tee. I have alternated using key limes, regular limes and regular limes (for the zest) and bottled lime juice.  Very minor nuances not withstanding, the end product is always delish! I am now offically always assigned the Key Lime Pie at our family events.  Thanks for posting!

This recipe is really simple. I've made it twice now, and it's come out perfectly every time. One of the top reviews says the 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk is "about" 2 cans. Well, it's closer to 2.5 cans. That cost me an extra trip to the store!

This was Amazing! And thanks to the reviewer who posted 20 key limes was about 3/4 cup. It was exactly for me! 

But please make the graham cracker crust! Soooo much better than the store bought ones!

This pleased both the grown ups and the kids at Thanksgiving. Planning to make another and attempt freezing it.

So smooth and creamy. I kinda cheated and used 3/4 cup of Nellie and Joes's keywest lime juice but followed everything else exactly. I let it sit in the fridge for a day and a half to be safe. Big hit at this years thanksgiving.

Won My Work's Pie Contest With This Recipe! Very Simple, Very Quick, However, Three Cups Of Sweetened Condensed Milk Makes A LOT Of Filling. Took Much Much Longer Than 8 Minutes To Cook. Took It Out When The Edges Were Just Starting To Brown. Still, Award-Winning Recipe!

Super sweet but that's the way key lime pie is supposed to taste.  Exceptionally easy.  As others said I used 2 cans of condensed milk which was the perfect amount and baked for 15-20 mins.

This was great but my favorite ever and easiest yet is just the condensed milk (non fat is available also) and a must is Nellie and Joes key lime juice. Just mix and pour into cooled crust!

Love this recipe! We were in the Keys in June and my son had to try Key Lime Pie wherever we went and I have to say this is better than 99% and just as good as the all the pie we tried. 

I did read the reviews and suggestions and made some changes. I only put in one can of the condensed milk. I then put some low fat cream cheese with ff plain yogurt in the food processor...since I didn't have sour cream I added some plain ff kefir. To add a bit more sweetness I used some Agave syrup. The first pie I squeezed limes but the second time I bought the Key lime juice (was less bitter than the limes)  which made 2 pies. For the crust I used graham crackers and almond meal and instead of butter used coconut oil. Awesome! My son said it was one of the best and the party I went to loved the pie also. 

Thanks to all for the suggestions. I love playing around with recipes and trying to make them a bit more healthful.

I was very skeptical of the simplicity of this ingredient list, but I got a creamy, delicious pie that, once cooked, had a very balanced taste and great, creamy texture. I think the lime zest also helped to round out the taste. I topped the pie with 1 cup of homemade whipped cream and sprinkled lime zest on top. Delicious!

I've used this recipe verbatim a few times, and I'm simply amazed each time. It's so simple that it almost breaks my brain that it comes out perfect, delicious, and so professional! Every time I've made it, I use a homemade crust (2.25 cups graham crumbs, .5 cup packed brown sugar, 5 oz melted butter), which is crazy good. -- I experimented this time. I love grapefruit, so I decided to try this recipe using fresh grapefruit juice instead of lime. Won't lie, I haven't tried it yet, but it looks and smells perfect. It took 20 minutes in the oven, however, so if you're daring enough to try it, keep that in mind!

You mean 5 ingredient pie?  There has to be a mistake...where's the egg yolks, the, the, the hard work?  HANDS DOWN WINNER!  (I halved the recipe, used one can of the sweetened condensed milk, half the other ingredients) it filled a smaller store bought crust perfect depth.  I've got enough room for topping or meringue. Wonderful!

Made this for company, it was a hit!! I had never made or ate Key Lime Pie, so I didnt really know what it was supposed to taste like, but we like it. I took one review suggestion and only baked for 8 min. and it did bubble after I took out of oven.
I will make again. thank you for sharing.

Awesome pie.
Made this three times now and it'll be my go-to.  So simple.  So quick.  Next time I may try and make my own crust!  I used key limes once and twice key lime juice from a bottle.  100% key lime juice.  SO much easier.  Lime zest is great.  Also have used lemon when I don't have lime.  Right in fridge after baking 10 min. Cant wait to make again and use a fun topping/garnish

I made this using fat- free condensed milk and using key- lime flavored fat- free greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I increased the recipe to use 4 cans of milk, 1 cup of lime juice and 2/3 cup of greek yogurt and made in a 9- inch springform pan. Seriously, this is absolutely the best key lime pie I have EVER eaten!

Pie turned out great! I used shortbread cookie crust instead of graham cracker crust which gave it a slight butter flavor. Yum!

After so many hours in the fridge the so called pie is still runny. The only way to eat it is to spoon it out. I'm really disappointed. Though the taste of this soup is quite good. With the recipe of Easy Key lime pie on this website I didn't have any problems.

I haven't had many key lime pies in my life, so I don't know exactly what to compare this to. I thought it was a delicious pie. It was a little bit rich, but delicious through and through. Thank You!

Squeezing all those little key limes was a bit of work but well worth it. The pie turned out perfect; sweet and tart jus as key lime pie should be.

Delicious! This was probably one of the easiest things I've made in terms of a dessert, and yet so good!!! I did use actual key limes instead of the juice - about 20 limes came out to 3/4 cup using a garlic pres.  And 2 cans of condensed milk was enough. The pin holes were hard to detect, so I just baked it for 12 minutes, and then put it in the refrigerator.

I never rate recipes, but had to in this case. This has very few ingredients, is SUPER easy to make, and is amazing. I couldn't find key limes, so I used plain persian limes plus one lemon to make it a little more tart, and it came out great. Love, Love, Love.

Ok, this is the second time I've made this pie. The first one, I would of given it 3 stars. I couldn't find key limes so I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of key lime concentrate. I forgot to buy a lime so I didn't add the rind in it. I didn't see any bubbles when I baked it. I tasted the pie about 6 hours later after being in the fridge. It was ok. I tasted more of the condensed milk instead of the limes. I, however, did like the firmness. The second time I made this, I did find some key limes in a bag and remembered to buy a lime. I purchased 1 regular condensed milk and one fat free, hoping it would lessen the flavor of the milk. It took a long time to press out the juice of the key limes. I ended up using the whole bag and gave me 1 cup. Everything else was the same. Still no bubbles on the second time, even after 12 mins. The second time was the winner! It was very tart, like the way we like it and full of flavor. No condensed milk flavor at all. It wasn't as firm as the first pie, but I do recommend the pie to be in the fridge for over 6 hours to firm and flavors to gel together. 2 big thumbs up!

This was really easy and really awesome! I ended up using a bit more lime juice than called for (right around a full cup), but otherwise followed it exactly. I also made my own crust, and it was great! The family gave great reviews too. This is a super easy and refreshing pie!

Awesome! The flavor was identical to the Key Lime Pie we had for dessert in Key West. I surprised my husband with this pie for Father's Day and he was truly amazed! Our 12 year-old daughter had never had Key Lime Pie and she loved it.
Observation- To achieve a truly authentic Key West Key Lime Pie taste, I used Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice and lime zest ( or lime shaving- that's what I used) is a must. I made one with lime shavings and one without- both excellent, but the one with the lime shavings had the exact Key West Key Lime Pie flavor.

My first ever attempt at making a key lime pie!!! It was a hit!!! Oh my goodness, this was delicious! My husband said, "bravo, sweetie!" It had the perfect sweetness and tartness. I juiced about 23 key limes to get 3/4 cup, and used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. I did not add the zest and it was great without it, in my opinion. I used the buttery crunch crust recipe off this site and lets just say I was in key lime pie heaven! Will definitely make again soon!!!

WOW!  I’ve never cared for Key Lime Pie until now.  This recipe is tops!  Perhaps the reason I liked it is because it does not contain any whipped topping in the filling.  The filling is very sweet, rich, and has a heavy, flan like custard texture.  Definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe and I thought it was really good for a key lime pie lover. I substituted a 1/2 cup non-fat Greek yogurt for the 1/2 cup of sour cream and it turned out really good. I would definitely make this recipe again!

I've made this pie 3 times now and used fresh key lime juice twice and bottled key lime juice and nobody could tell the difference.  Everyone said it was the best key lime pie they've ever had (and we live in Florida). I prefer the fresh squeezed just to say I made it all by hand but if you don't feel like juicing 40+ tiny lime halves then by all means use bottled key lime juice!

DELICIOUS and SIMPLE. I froze the pie and served it that way.  I used one can regular and one can of fat free milk.  I also used low-fat sour cream.  I could not imagine using full fat ingredients making this taste ANY better!!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Excellent recipe and so easy!  I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted plain, nonfat Greek yogurt and it worked perfectly plus made it a little healthier!  I didn't add any grated lime zest since I didn't have a grater, but the omission didn't seem to affect the taste.  An excellent recipe I will repeat many times.

OMG! This pie is great! The added key lime zest is a perfect addition. I made this pie with the sour cream and then two days later I made another pie, but I used Fage Non-fat Greek Yogurt instead of Sour Cream. Some of the same people had both pies and said it tasted the same after I told them about the substitution. So I'll stick with the Yogurt from now on. If you decide to use yogurt, it has to be thick greek yogurt. Dannon or yoplait isn't going to work as well. Please make your own crust for this pie. It doesn't deserve a store bought. 
:D

This might be the best pie I have ever made...and other than the squeezing of 24 key limes (thank goodness for the garlic press), possibly the easiest! I left out the zest because I prefer a creamier texture and blended for a full 2 minutes. Be sure to pick the seeds out of the halved key limes before sqeezing because these seeds are softer and even with the garlic press you can get some seed pulp which is a bit bitter. When cooking, I did not wait for the 'tiny bubbles' but pulled the pie out at exactly 10 minutes, allowed to cool for about an hour - uncovered, and then placed in the frig overnight with a cheesecloth lightly covering so it didn't get soggy on top. Perfect pie!

Even though I used bottled key lime juice, it was still awesome.  Can't wait to use fresh key limes.  I made a crust with cheap sugar cookies, butter and toasted coconut, chopped it all fine in the food processor and then pressed into the pie pans.  Bake the shells for 10 minutes, add the filling and bake another 10 minutes.   SO much better than graham crackers since it does not compete with the filling.

LOVED this!  I was wondering how a recipe with such few ingredients and such little work could be THAT good, but it is!!  The most time consuming part was jucing the key limes, but as a previous reviews said, a garlic press works like a charm.  I can't wait to make this again!

Yum Yum Yum!!! This was my first go at a key lime pie. There are so many options; I didn’t know which was the “true” key lime pie. I went with this one because it had fresh key lime juice, no green dye or jello, and, just about anything with condensed sweet milk is yummy. I will definitely make it again.  I can’t wait to make it for company! Note: the fresher the key limes, the easier they are to squeeze and the less you will need to squeeze. Some of my key limes had hardened a bit and produced very little juice. Also, the pinholes were hardly there. I cooked it a couple extra minutes just in case and took it out even though I didn’t see any. Lol, my fiancé had a hard time believing I cooked this myself!! It’s crazy how good this was considering how easy it was to make. One of the easiest if not the easiest pie I have ever made.

This is THE BEST pie. We make it every year, when we can find key limes. Takes a while to squeeze all those little key limes, but it's SO worth it!!

Please take note that this recipe calls for key limes, not the regular limes in the store!  If you are using regular limes, they are not the same and they do not taste the same. Key limes aren't much bigger than an avocado seed, and they should be yellow in color. Can't find key limes? Buy Nellie and Joe's key lime juice in the juice aisle, it's a good substitution and no squeezing.  Anyway.. this pie was perfect! I followed the directions exactly (using just under 2 cans of condensed milk) and it made a 9" pie to the brim, plus plenty of extra left over to bake in a ramekin without a crust for my gluten free daughter. Both turned out perfectly!  It tasted better than I ever expected. I've had KLP in Key West, so I know what it should taste like. This is really, really close.  8 minutes in the oven is perfect, and make sure you add the zest to the filling. Let it sit overnight in the fridge - this is a must or the flavored won't be fully incorporated. If you love real key lime pie, you won't be disappointed!

Funny how a bunch of these reviews start out with "so I made this for my boyfriend/husband and....." well, because key lime is his favorite, I made this for my boyfriend. He made glorious, "now-I-can-die-happy" faces when he took the first bite, and said it was the best he'd ever had, bar none. 
I also thought it was fantastic: it's super rich, and oh-so-very decadent. The kind of thing you pair with hot coffee or tea. The filling is thick, heavy, creamy, sweet, tangy, and ultra smooth.. (if you're looking for a lighter, fluffier version, IRENED's is also fantastic and not as heavy). 
Bottom line? This was delicious, and I am already being begged to make another one. Wouldn't change a thing.

I used to live in Key West, and this is how they do it down there.  I'm no fan of sweetened condensed milk, but it's a foil to the lime juice.  The sour cream lightens the intensity just enough.

Great! A simple and delicious key lime pie. Be prepared for extreme sweetness! I served it with generous helpings of whipped cream and the whole family loved it. Though, I thought there was way too much lime zest. Next time I will cut it by half.

This recipe is perfection. I made it exactly as stated, with 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk (just shy of 3 cans), and I used organic 100% lime juice. I gave it 8 minutes in the oven and 5 hours in the fridge.  It was truly perfect. All the things that people say in the reviews to try, just ignore.

Very easy to make and looked wonderful but I was very disappointed because it just tasted like condensed milk mixed with lime juice. I will not be making this again.  I saw some copycat recipes for the key lime pie served at Pappadeaux Restaurant and will try that.

This was my first time making key lime pie. Based on other reviews, I only used two 14 ounce cans of sweetened condensed milk.

My pie didn't produce any bubbles, but I took it out of the oven after 12 minutes.  Let it cool for 15 minutes, and then put it in the fridge.

I'd recommend definitely leaving it in the fridge overnight, as some other reviewers suggested.  Tasted the pie after two hours in the fridge, and it tasted mostly like sweetened condensed milk with a little sour cream.  However, the next day its tartness came out.  The pie was tasty the next day.

Froze a couple of pieces, and brought them out for guests about a week later.  My guests had good things to say about this recipe.

I'd make this again.

Made this 2 ties, once with limes I had around, (I am in podunk Maine) and then with real key lime juice from Trader Joes. It was better with the real limes. Will go back to that.

Key lime is my husband's favorite pie.  He said that the limey-ness of this recipe was perfect, but the texture was too soft, almost like pudding.  I'm not sure what the texture is technically supposed to be like, but this recipe wasn't what the hubs was looking for so we compromised with 3 stars for the great flavor.

I've tried many key lime pie recipes and this is by far my favorite!  I always add a tsp of vanilla as well and make my own graham cracker crust with crushed crackers and butter.  I used the sweetened whipped cream recipe from this site (doubled) for thick fluffy layer on top.  I've had many people tell me it's the best they've had. Thanks for the recipe!

I chose this recipe based on all the reviews.  Wow....this pie is fabulous.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband, mother, and kids raved over this pie.  They have all asked me to make another pie.  So I'm making another one today.  This recipe is a must keep.

Ok.  Coming very late to this party.  Made exactly as directed with the addition of homemade whip cream spread on top.  Got down on my hands and knees to watch for the elusive pinhole bubbles ( I have a very low oven).  They appeared at exactly 5 minutes 13 seconds.  Removed from oven at that point.  Not too sweet.  Not too tart.  Just right.  In my opinion.

I'm a Miami native, and lived in Key Largo for a good while, so when I say this taste like an authentic Key Lime Pie, you can trust it's the truth! It's perfect just the way it is. I wouldn't dare try and change a thing. (Also, looking through the pics that people have submitted, I can't help but giggle at all the ones dyed green. Unless you're making this around Christmas, don't do it people. It just makes it look silly.)

Wow is right! I agree with everyone about this recipe. I tried it last night, followed the recipe exactly and had fab results. Since it's 95 degrees here, I cooked the pie in a nuwave oven for 10 minutes and didn't heat up the house! I will definitely be making this again!

This is so easy to make and it is very good. Thank the reviewer who suggested juicing the limes with a garlic press. I used 22 key limes for the 3/4 cup of the juice. I served them with homemade whipped cream.  I used 3 cups of the sweetened condensed milk, which is about 2 1/4 cans. I left out the lime zest because I don't want it too tart. I baked it for 10 minutes.

I was very skeptical about this when I read the ingredients, and was very skeptical when I mixed up the filling and it smelled rather cheesy. But man, the flavor and the texture makes this the best key lime pie my husband and I have ever had! Definitely give this recipe a try- you'll be glad you did!

This is, hands down, the best key lime pie that we've ever had! I can't believe that this was so simple to make (it literally took like 10 minutes start to finish). I used 2 cans of condensed milk and that worked perfectly...followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Great flavor and so refreshing... Will def be making this often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So wonderfully simple and perfection. HOWEVER, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk are only about 1 1/8 cup -- nowhere close to the required 3 cups. You need 3 cans. I use Greek yogurt because I always have it and it works beautifully.

Absolutely perfect!!!  I don't think I'll ever buy Key Lime out again, because I'll always be disappointed in spending $3-$5 on an inferior piece of pie.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Loved this pie! Key lime is my favorite dessert and I am always looking for a great key lime pie recipe. This is delicious but really is better if eaten the next day or later. I planned on making the recipe as stated and thought 2 cans of milk would equal 3 cups but was a little less. That is all the milk I used however because I don't like a key lime pie that doesn't hold its shape. This amount worked perfectly. I definitely would not leave out the zest. It does give it appeal visually and a little burst of lime that is wonderful with key lime. I also made a homemade graham cracker crust. I personally just think the store bought crust doesn't compare. Finally, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and made a topping out of 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. It was delicious and worked fabulous as a topping to this pie. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is so easy I let my 7 year old do it. Then he feels all wonderful because he made something that tastes so good :-) I do use my own graham cracker crust though, store bought just doesn't cut it for me.

this was super delicious. I was worried before we chilled it, because I felt like it simply tasted like sweetened condensed milk and lime. 

But wow! Only use two cans of condensed milk, otherwise you'll have a lot of extra filling. Also add a **heaping** tablespoon of zest.


Mmmmmm made with a homemade graham cracker crust. I'm making this twice in as many weeks, it's sooo good!!

This isn't just the easiest key lime pie you'll ever make - it might be the best you'll ever make! I've made several key lime pies in my day, and this is my favorite. At first I was skeptical (what, no eggs?) but I soon found out I had no reason to be. I add a single drop of green food coloring just to give it that light green tint. I also top with whipped cream.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is so easy to make and tastes WONDERFUL. I made this pie for two separate families and everyone raved about it. The only thing I changed is that I didn't use 1 tablespoon of grated lime zest and instead used 1 teaspoon. I did this because I didn't have a zester and removing the peel with a knife was a pain. The pie still tasted wonderful with this change.

The only hard part is juicing all those little limes!  Just cook for 10 minutes because I never see the bubbles.  Have taken to several family and office events, and everyone always wants the recipe.

I brought this to a family get together and wanted to make it slightly larger, so I used a 10in" pie pan. I wanted to make it gluten free, so I looked for a GF graham crust. When I could find neither GF graham crust nor GF graham cookies, I decided to use GF shortbread cookies (Shar brand in the yellow bag). I used two 7.5 bags (I left 10 cookies over b/c I didn't feel like I needed that extra bit), mashed them into crumbs (same to about 2 3/4 cups), then combined it with 9tbsp of softened butter and 2tbsp of cane sugar. I pressed in into the 10"pie crust and then poured in the filling (no pre-baking or chilling). The crust was thick - exactly how I wanted it.

I ended up using 3 (14oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk, a tiny bit more than 3/4 cup of lime juice, the same 1/2 cup sour cream and the 1tbsp of lime rind. It ended up being too much filling so I didn't use all of it. Next time, if I do 10" I'll just stick to the same measurements. But aside from that, it came out AMAZING. Everyone loved it. It had the right amount of tartness and creaminess, and the shortbread was a nice compliment to both. I can't wait to make this again.

Awesome recipe It's my go-to for Key lime Pie.  Living in MN key limes are not prolific we get them 1x per year.  The rest of the year I use bottled key lime juice.  It still turns out terrific.  Nelly and Joes is an excellent bottled key lime juice.

Made this pie three times.  Sooooo very easy and yummy.  Put it into a graham cracker crust.   Once I used a meringue, but its so good by itself I don't think I'll bother doing that again.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow!  I made this for a Memorial day BBQ and I couldn't believe how fast it went.  It was a huge hit.  My mother-in-law made her "infamous" peach cobbler and no one ever cut into it until the key lime pie I had made was gone.  Next time I will have to make two.

Divine key lime pie!!  I bought key limes in Arizona while on vacation, just for this purpose.  Made as directed, but with my own crust following others' advice to use 2 C. ground graham crackers and 1/2 C. melted butter.  NOTE:  I used a standard 9-inch Pyrex pie plate, and that amount of graham cracker crust was way too much.  I ended up removing 2/3 C. of the crumbs/butter mixture, which I'll use for something else.  Doesn't get any easier than this, and what a treat!!

Incredibly simple--has a perfect balance of sweet and tartness. I was reminded of the scene in Dexter, where Camilla says she is in a perpetual search for the perfect Key Lime Pie. Search over.

Delicious! Instead of squeezing all of those limes, one can buy a bottle of key lime juice and still add the lime zest. Mine came out quite delicious, and easier than squeezing 30 limes!

For being as simple as this recipe is, there is nothing that beats it! I am constantly on the search for the best Key Lime Pie and nothing has beaten this one since I discovered it. I am known for making this and frequently get requests. People rave about how good it is and I constantly hear how they have never had better. I mix some cinnamon in the crust when I make it (following the recipe for Graham Cracker Crust I) and that gives it a great zing that people love. This recipe is so quick, simple, and delicious, it's amazing!

This is my new key lime pie recipe, & it is SO easy to make!  I made my own graham cracker crust & used 2 - 14oz cans non-fat sweetened condensed milk & 1/2 C Daisy Light sour cream.  It was DELICIOUS!  I topped it off w/ some fresh-made whipped cream.  YUM!

Made this for Mother's Day and it was easy & awesome! I ran out of sour cream because I decided to double the recipe at the last minute so I use a few spoonfuls of Greek Yogurt and let the pies chill overnight in the fridge. I served this with cool whip. Everyone loved it!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make..I used 2 cans of condensed milk with the rest of the ingredients and it turned out to be too much for a 9" graham pie crust...the larger crust would be better..I used the rest of the filling and dipped my fresh pineapple into it...delicious...Thanks for the recipe..I also baked the pie for 12 minutes... couldn't see the pinhole bubbles...I also served it with cool whip...I was told that it was great..

This key lime pie tasted awesome! The condensed sweetened milk gave the pie a very creamy texture. Yummy! The grated lemon zest gave a special treat in the key lime filling. I used a low fat graham cracker crust to save a few calories; could not notice any difference in the taste of the crust. I used real key limes, squeezed those little buggers with my juicer! I guess there might be key lime juice in a bottle but the real key limes made this pie delicious!

This is hands down the most amazing key lime pie I've ever tasted. This recipe is fantastic and everyone that tried it LOVED it. The only thing I added was a little vanilla extract.

My pie was so sour it was almost inedible! Key limes were not available in my supermarket so I purchased bottled key lime juice. Maybe this is where I went wrong. Would be willing to try this recipe again when I can find some fresh key limes.

The best of the best.  You can pick up a lime juicer in most local Mexican grocery stores.  Take's all of 5 min. with the juicer.  I used 1 cup of lime juice.

This is my first review on allrecipies, and I can't think of a better recipe to review!!  Absolutely the best key lime pie I have ever had!!  I gave a slice to my sister, and she said it was "DA BOMB"!!  I make a whole pie for her for Christmas and she was in heaven.  The only thing I added was some crushed walnuts in the bottom of the pie crust before adding the filling and a dash of Rediwhip on each piece. DELICIOUS!!!!

Excellent pie, the best we've had since a particular favorite in the state of Florida (where the hubby and I are from.)  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using regular limes instead of key limes since I can't find any in Hawaii.  My only criticism is that it was a little too sweet, and not tart enough.  This is very possibly explained by the lime difference.  If making it again with regular limes, I would probably use just two cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of using all three cups.  Several others mentioned they used two cans since it was easier and it worked well.

I am basing this review from my dad since he is the key lime pie fan in the fam. It was really good but was a bit too rich for me. Squeezing the limes seemed to take forever and the garlic press idea didn't work at all for me.

This was delicious. I made it for 60 people and everyone raved. It was very time consuming making it for a large crowd however. I might consider using regular limes since they are bigger or buying key lime juice and using regular limes for the zest.

Loved It.  Great reviews from everyone!  I couldn't find Key Limes so I settled on 14 Persian Limes.  They gave me 3/4c of lime juice and the flavor was just right.  Easy and delicious pie.  I already have a request to make this for the next Birthday!

I enjoyed this recipe, especially how easy & quick to make it is.  However I do like my Key lime just a little more tart, next time I'm going with a full cup of key lime juice.

This pie tastes like lime flavored condensed milk  but it doesn't even have enough lime flavor either.  It will pass, but my dad, whom will normally eat ANYTHING, thought how strongly it tasted like the condensed milk!  Do yourself a favor and use the Key Lime Pie recipe on the side of the key lime juice bottle. But if you are going to make this recipe, use the 10" prepared graham cracker crust.  Otherwise you'll have lime flavored condensed milk pudding left over!

I've never had key lime pie until I made this so take my review for what it's worth.  The pie is really good, but I needed some whipped cream on it in order to eat it.  It is a very bitter/tart pie.  I needed the sweetened whipped cream in order to enjoy it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is a super simple recipe to make.  I may reduce the amount of lime juice next time just a touch.

I couldn't find key limes in the grocery store so I got regular limes, probably only need 10 if you are using regular limes.  Go to Walmart and get a lime squeezer for $5.  Saves a lot of time.  So easy!

Wow, this pie was SO SWEET!  I felt like I was eating sweetened condensed milk with a fork!  Good texture and good lime flavor but way too sweet for me.

I loved the texture. I wasn't able to achieve the texture in another recipe I tryed. But the pie was way too sour! I might try making it again without any lime zest. But I will try another recipe "Phonecians" (not sure of the spelling) recipe and see how that one turns out.

Look no further - this is the best key lime pie recipe.  The hardest thing about this recipe is the juicing.  Planning on trying the garlic press next time. Be sure to zest the limes BEFORE you juice them.  Use one of those keebler shortbread crusts - came out great.  Everyone asks me for this recipe!!!

My husband, who dislikes sweets, loved this dish. He wouldn't eat a whole slice, but ate enough for me to be convinced that most folks would love it too. I would have rated it higher if I had key limes.

Fantastic taste, and really easy.  A word of warning though -- this is not a pretty pie.  It comes out to be a sort of pale beige with green flecks from the lime zest.  I added some green food coloring, which made it sort of greenish brown. If you're going to serve it to guests, I'd add a layer of cool whip to the top.  Tastes FANTASTIC though.

I'm sorry, but I was not impressed with this pie at all. Key lime pie is one of my favorite desserts, and I was so excited to try this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and before I put it in the oven, I knew something was not right. The pie was not at all firm, it was almost like a pudding. It was not tart (that's just my preference), and the sweetened condensed milk overpowered the whole pie. I guess this would be a good recipe if your looking to make an Eagle's Brand Milk pie.

My husbands favorite pie is key lime pie so I decided to surprise him.  I followed the recipe except I used regular limes instead of key limes.  It was a lot less work juicing the big limes instead of the tiny ones.  The recipe was very easy and he loved it.  He loved the tartness, and the zest in the pie made it over the top good.  I will be making this pie many times.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I just made this for Easter tomorrow and it turned out awesome!! I used mini graham cracker pie crusts and doubled the recipe. I filled 18 mini pies and had enough filling left over for an 9" pie which I will probably make and freeze Monday. I only needed 15 so we got to sample it before tomorrow and it was fantastic! A definite keeper! Delicious and a cinch to make. Note: I did omit swirling in the grated rind based on other reviewers comments. I'll let you know later how well it freezes.

The texture of the pie reminded me of cheesecake. I wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars, because it is good. It's just a tad too sweet for me, and not as tangy as I like. Great recipe though!

4 STARS for taste but 2 stars for texture.  Creamy in a strange way....kinda like refrigerated sweetened condensed milk with a splash of lime juice and sour cream.  Will try another recipe (with eggs) next time.

This is my go-to Key Lime Pie recipe! It’s so easy and always impresses! I buy 4 regular oil’ plain limes—I use the juice from 3 limes, use the zest from 1 lime for inside the pie, and the zest from the leftover to garnish. Don’t forget to save a thin line slice for garnish!! I usually whip up my own cream for the topping to ensure it’s not too sweet. The slightly sweet fresh cream topping really lends to the tartness of the pie. Yay!

This is the best and easiest key lime pie. I needed a quick dessert. I made it at noon (only took 15 min to mix and bake) and was cooled and ready by to serve by 6. Was enjoyed by all.

So very good!  This is my second time making this pie.  I used the graham crust recipe from this site (Graham Cracker Crust I - did not pre-bake the crust before adding in the filling), and made them into a dozen cupcake-size pies.  Last time I made them as a regular pie.  I only needed 6 regular limes to get 3/4 cup.  Everything was so easy, and still tasted so delicious!

I made it, but only used two cans of sweetened condensed milk. I also saved some of the filling and put it in a ramekin and baked in a water bath. I did this for my sister in-law who eats gluten free. DELICIOUS. Super easy. I will definitely make this again.

Took about 15-20 minutes for the bubbles to rise to the surface.  Not a strong key lime flavor. Will add more zest next time. reminded us of a cheesecake.

Made this for my Father In Law's birthday. Everyone raved how good it was! I used 2 cans of condensed milk and baked for about 10 or 11 minutes as bubbles were really difficult to see. Turned out perfect. Will most definitely make this again and again!!

So easy to make! I did find that two 14oz cans of sweetened condense milk did not give me 3+ cups. I returned to the store to get more and ended up having more then would fit in the pie crust. Two cans seems to be ideal.  I also baked for about 10 minutes.

I searched the internet for "Pappadeaux's Key Lime Pie". I saw several "Copy Cat" recipes. I decided to try this one since it didn't have eggs.

The filling is perfect! In speaking with a friend, she reminded me that Pappadeaux's has pecans in the crust. The second time I made it, I put pecans in the bottom, since I used a prepared crust. I use dabs of readi-whip to make it pretty. Everyone goes crazy over it.

Now I just need a good Raspberry sauce (without the seeds) to drizzle over it.

This is the only key lime recipe I will make from now on.  I have made the others that call for egg yolks, they were good but this is better. I made my own graham crust, I did not bake the crust first. I baked the pie  14 min and it was perfect.

Excellent and easy. I used bottled key lime juice due to past problems with flavor when using fresh key limes.

Seriously amazing! I love key lime pie, so I’m picky about my pie. I’m so excited that it’s so awesome and easy to make! Followed the recipe exactly. I used the bottled key lime juice, made my own graham cracker crust, and homemade whipped cream. I’ll be making it again soon! I would recommend letting it sit in the fridge for at least 5 hours before eating so it’s the right consistency and not runny.

Sorry but this was WAY too sweet. Even my sugar addicted son said it was too sweet. I've looked up other recipes for key lime pie and NONE of them contain this much sweetened condensed milk or other sweeteners. It was very thick and creamy, which was nice, but I couldn't eat more than 2 bites of it, and the sugar made my teeth hurt and my throat burn. And I know it wasn't the lime juice that caused the burn because I munched on straight lime slices while making this pie and had no problem. I won't make this again.

Excellent . I baked it a little longer than suggested so  the crust would get more toasted. My whole family enjoyed it. I used 7 1/2 small limes (I have an electric squeezer) and 2 cans of condensed milk. You don't need eggs. Leave it sitting in the fridge for 2 hours. It will eventually become firm and easy to cut with a knife. Note: The second time I made it used 24 key limes but I prefer the small limes instead since they are easier to squeeze. Squeezing 24 little limes is not fun.

I had never made Key Lime Pie before and was a little intimidated.  I decided to try this for a friend's birthday.  It turned out to be a huge hit!  I made the recipe just as is and everyone loved it.  I will be making this again!

This always gets rave reviews from my family- it is the best key lime pie I've ever eaten. These are the changes I've made which I recommend: I make a homemade graham cracker crust (Graham cracker Crust I from this website), I use 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and don't worry about measuring 3 cups, I add a couple extra tablespoons of lime juice, and I zest an entire lime and add in it (I want it to taste like lime!). Then I make homemade whipped cream and top with 1 sliced lime and add more lime zest on the top of both flavor and decor. It is beautiful! My family says it is the perfect amount of lime....try this you won't be disappointed!

I haven't read all the reviews, but I have a hint with the lime juice.  If you put them in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and rub them hard on a cutting board, it will take far less keylimes/limes.  I only needed 6.

It was so easy to make and smells good.  Can't wait to try it!

Absolutely Fabulous Recipe!! I used the 3 cups sweetened condensed milk as directed (almost 3, 14oz cans, made just over 3 cups), a Keebler Pre Made Graham Cracker Crust (“with 2 extra servings”), Nellie and Joes Key West Key Lime Juice, and 1tbs of freshly grated lime zest. I also squeezed a whole key lime for extra tartness. I baked for 10minutes and while the pin bubbles were hard to see initially they were there and didn’t burst. This was absolutely delicious. This has become a permanent family dish! I’ll never buy a store bought key lime pie ever again. I finished it off by having a bit of fun (I was inspired by another posters photo of a palm tree decoration) and created a palm tree on my pie as well. I do live in South Carolina after all lol. And of course all topped with yummy whip cream. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It’s definitely going to be the star of many family occasions!

This was terrible.  I don't understand how this received such good reviews. It  was heavy and sickly sweet.  I had to throw it out after my daughter and I ate a piece and promptly felt ill from the weight of it in our guts.  After all that work of juicing the key limes it was a real disappointment.

It was going well until the part where bubbles are supposed to pop after 6 to 8 minutes of baking.  Well I continued baking and baking and baking, checking every 2 minutes, and the bubbles never popped, and the filling stayed runny.Tasted good... like a very sweet key lime pie, maybe a little too sweet, but it certainly needs something to firm it up.  After reading many reviews and watching Allrecipe's video, I'm convinced that the 3 cups of condensed milk the recipe calls for is too much.  Many positive reviewers said they only used 2 cans of condensed milk, and in the video they only used 2 cans (which is about 2 3/4 cups). Arius Hung's modifications sound worth trying (1 can condensed milk + 8 oz of cream cheese instead of 3 cups condensed milk... and blend it all up with a blender) so I might try that.

We just returned home from the Keys a few weeks ago and I really wanted to try my hand at making a Key Lime pie for Easter after having sampled it at five different restaurants in the Keys.     After looking a many recipes, I decided on this one even though it wasn’t strictly traditional.   Another reviewer stated that two cans of sweetened condensed milk are three cups.  I measured very carefully and scraped the cans out and it was short by almost a ½ cup.   I decided to stick with the recipe using ¾ cup lime juice anyways as I didn’t want to risk it being too sweet.   I put it in the preheated oven and no pin sized bubbles appeared let alone burst at five minutes.  I cooked it for 20 minutes and it started to ever so slightly brown on the edges so I pulled it out immediately.  I cooled to room temp and then put in the fridge overnight.   The consistency was perfect upon serving but it was slightly too tart for my taste. I think I will try two cans with 2/3 cup lime juice next time.

Can't say I wasn't a bit skeptical at first - a pie with only 5 ingredients? Get out of here! However, I was totally, totally wrong. This is the best, simplest recipe for key lime pie. I didn't have key limes, so I used regular limes. It still tasted great. My lemon juicer saved me from endless lime squeezing. I kneaded the limes a bit beforehand so they'd be easier to squeeze. Added a bit of vanilla and baked for around 12-15 minutes, and voila.

This is a fantastic recipe because it is SUPER EASY and tastes great! I have made it a few times. Tonight, my grocery store did not have any key limes, so I just had to buy the regular larger ones. It took 9 regular limes. Honestly, I could not tell the difference. Key limes are supposed to be sweeter, but with all the sweetened condensed milk in here (2 cans) the pie is plenty sweet even with regular limes. 
This pie absolutely needs home made whipped topping on the top of it. Just whip a pint of heavy cream with 3 T. sugar added into it. Whip until thick, put in a ziplock bag with a tiny corner cut off so that you can pipe it on the top. Perfection every time!

I absolutely love this key lime pie recipe! It was ridiculously easy to make! My only note is that mine took closer to 20 minutes to set-up in the oven as opposed to the suggested 10 minutes.

I did not care for this. Made it exactly per recipe. Key limes are always variable and the flavor of these was not great. That should not have mattered for the basic chemistry. Temperature was dead-on in the oven. It took 45 minutes, not 5-8 and the result: overcooked in some spots, soupy otherwise. Last time I'll use condensed mil for anything.

Amazing! Used less than 3 cups of condensed milk cause it was too much for the pie,  and its very important to keep it at least 4-5h in the fridge, i din't and it was a bit mushy, but still tasted exactly the same as the one i buy at Rochaberry :) cheers

Sweet, tangy, creamy.  Juuuust right.  
Note: zest is optional in my opinion, and I think the pie looks better w/o it.  I think whipped cream on top is also optional.
  Try making mini pies like I did!  :)  Bake them for 5 minutes on a tray together (you can buy the mini pie crusts in packs of 6).

I made this for the first time last night and I 'm so glad I did. I had Mexican limes that came in my weekly food basket, so I used those and made a pretzel crust using coconut oil instead of butter. The crust complimented the creamy filling perfectly. This is my new 'go to' recipe for key lime pie. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this twice and it's very easy and forgivable if you don't have enough of a certain ingredient. The critisism is that it's a little too sweet. I made it today for my hubby and was about 1/2 c shy of 3c of the sweetened condensed milk and it was still too sweet. I think if I used the 2 cans of condensed milk (2.5 c) and 1 c sour cream (instead of 1/2 c) it would have been absolutely perfect.

I would like more tart, less sweet, but I am still going to give this five stars for ease and respectability.

Excellent recipe for a newbie like me. I ran into a little trouble when I put the first attempt into the fridge. It didn't firm up as I expected. It had the consistency of firm pudding. The second attempt went better. I put it in the freezer for a couple of hours and it firmed up perfectly. The taste is terrific-light and lime-y, lol.

Delicious!! I will cut back on line juice (Nellie and Joe's Key West  lime juice) next time. I baked it for 15 minutes. Instead of 3 cups of Eagle Brand milk I used two cans. My husband loved it. I served with a little cool whip.  Fabulous dessert if you want  to impress someone without all the work!!

I guess I am in a minority on this one. My husband really liked it, but I did not like it at all.  I kept thinking....I am basically just eating a slice of condensed milk.  Oh well.....hubby ate it all so that's why I gave it three stars.

I have made this recipe twice now and I just can't get enough of it.  Sooo yummy and sooo easy!  The first time I made it I used a store bought graham cracker crust (mistake!) and used Mexican limes because that was all I had.  Honestly, other than the crust, I thought the Mexican limes tasted just fine.  So, the second time I made it, I used another reviewer's suggestion of replacing one of the cans of condensed milk with an 8 oz. tub of whipped cream cheese.  Divine!  I will be making it that way from now on...with the homemade graham cracker crust, of course.  I can't wait for another "pie" holiday to come around so I have an excuse to make this again.

Tear-jerkingly good. But I'm glad I didn't have three cups of condensed milk to put it, it nearly overflowed at 2.5. Also, in the off chance you have a Jack Lalanne juicer, I got this done by cutting the rind off the limes like they were watermelon (hacking off both ends then shaving off all sides) and juicing only 7 of them.

I adore this recipe. I add more zest than called for, which I think really adds to the overall taste. Everyone I've made it for has loved it, and I get requests for it all the time.

This pie was absolutely delicious!!! Perfect balance to the flavor a of the filling. I made my own crust and added chopped almonds to the graham cracker crumbs. Added great texture! Delicious! Thank you for sharing!

I never made Key Lime Pie before, and I swept the prizes at a pie bake off contest at work with this pie. I had several changes though. 

I made the crust with 1/2 c roasted macadamia nuts, 4 T coconut oil, and 1 packet of crushed graham crackers: press into pan and bake 10 min. 

For the filling, I used about twice as much zest. 

For the topping, I used Emeril's recipe- mix 2 T powdered sugar into 1 c sour cream, and spread it on top after the pie has been chilled for about 2 hours in the fridge. In the morning a put a ring of zest around the outside of the pie, made an overlapping circle of lime slices, and put a few raspberries in the middle. 

It was amazing, there was none left, and people were asking for the recipe! I will definitely make again!

This recipe is simply Excellent! I baked a graham cracker crust in a 10" springform pan   and  used two cans of condensed milk and a little more lime as per the recipe. We just got back from a Father's Day family function and the pie was all gone in less than  10 minutes.  This is for sure  a keeper "NO DOUBT".

Super good and super easy!  I did the math badly and bought 2 cans sweetened condensed milk which actually works out to 2 1/2 c, but it worked out fine and I didn't have to waste half a can. I used Mexican limes because no way was I juicing 200 tiny key limes.   The bake time was a little off. I kept waiting for the bubbles to pop but they didn't, so I gave up at 12 min. Chilled overnight then served with homemade whipped cream. No leftovers!

Not a big fan...  I wanted to try this recipe, thinking it was more "authentic" than the ones I've made in the past...  Very tart, which wasn't a bad thing...  Just not the right consistency for my liking.

I follow the recipe exactly as it shows. The consistency was like a pudding you just can not eat in slices they just melt even when the pie es almost frozen.

Fantastic!  The garlic press tip is the best, traps the seeds and is fast and efficient.  I was disappointed in store-bought graham cracker crust, so I ordered one from local bakery, cost less and looks and tastes much better!

Either juice whole limes (or a combination of Key and "regular" limes) or do not make this recipe! I'm not kidding. I've also made the recipe with just Mexican ((not Key), it was very good, maybe even better)).Do not use bottled lime juice!
I recommend homemade graham cracker crust, but that is your choice.
Whisk the ingedients well and skip the baking, just chill for several hours. And do not use low- or non-fat whipped topping, it will ruin the fresh citrusy flavor.

This is very easy and tastes as good as any other key lime pie that I've ever had! Like some other reviewers, I found that the recipe as written makes more filling than you need--next time I'll only use 2 cups of condensed milk. The ONLY thing that keeps this from being a five star recipe. Overall, though, this is great.

Delicious and sooo easy. A bit on the sweet side but I didn't top mine with any cream. The cream might be good to temper the sweetness. I can't believe how fast it is to make as well. It makes more than enough filling so next time I won't fill my crust so much.

I add one can on the SCM and increase the sour cream to 1 cup. Less sweet and more tart!

I had a bunch of limes from my Bountiful Basket so I made this recipe and it was delicious and easy!  I used the juice from about 8 limes (I was surprised when another review said 20); 2 can of the milk.  I should have grated the limes I was using for the juice before cutting them in half and juicing them.  My husband and kids were vying for the left over piece. Can't wait to make again.

After reading a couple of the reviews for this recipe,  I chose it to use the fresh key limes I purchased yesterday.  It took my husband & me ONE HOUR to juice enough limes for 1 cup!!!  A 15-minute prep time is unrealistic if you are using fresh KEY limes (which are tiny compared to regular limes.)  And, let me add, if it weren't for one of the reviewer's suggestions to use a garlic press, it would have taken even longer!  So keep that in mind if you are going for the authentic Key Lime Pie.

So easy and so delicious! The store was out of key limes, so I had to sub with half lemon juice and half regular lime juice (3/8 c of each). It was great nonetheless!

Next time I make this I will skip the zest completely.  I also used my garlic press to squeeze the limes, and as a result, may have gotten some of the bitter part of the lime too.  I think I'll try adding a little sugar too.  Creamy texture and simple recipe (other than squeezing 17 tiny limes). I was NOT happy with the taste of my pie.

I used this same recipe but I used beaten egg yolks. My family loved it. I'm only 15 and I'm teaching myself how to cook so it was quick and easy and we fell in love!

Very good. I thought it was a bit tart and would make it again without the lime rind.

Very quick and easy to make and quite tasty. A nice mix of tart and sweet flavors, though I might make it just slightly sweeter next time, perhaps by adding whipped cream as a topping. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, as other reviewers suggested, instead of measuring out 3 cups. I will definitely make this again!

So very easy and tastes great. I made it crustless by just spraying a pie pan w/pam and baking as directed for 8 minutes. My husband who is very picky about sweets loved it!

I enjoyed this pie and so did the 3 other adults I cooked it for. The ingredients chilled well together giving it a nice texture. It stored well and didn't have a sweet runny syrup at the bottom of the pan. Will make this again.

Such an easy recipe to follow and a terrific end result.    I followed other suggestions and purchased a little over 20 key limes and ended up with just the right amount of juice.

This makes an excellent pie.  I received lots of compliments from a very picky crowd.  I made it with freshly squeezed key lime juice and a shortbread crust.

This was so good and so easy! I went overboard and used all 3 cans of condensed milk, didn't know what to do with that tiny bit left and didn't want to waste!  It does take LOTS of limes, but is so good.  I too waited for what seemed forever for the tiny bubbles to appear... finally they did around the edge and I took it out. It took at least 10 minutes, maybe a little more.. I wouldn't wait longer than that or the texture changes. We loved it without the whipping cream, but if you find it tart, have some whipping cream on hand... Perfect! yummm! turned out good the first time :)

Incredible!  Can easily substitute with bottled key lime juice if you are in a pinch for time.  "Nellie & Joe's" key lime juice is my favorite.

Love it! Very easy to make. Follow the directions && you will be fine even if you are not the best baker. I made this for my boyfriend and his dad and they were so surprised. His dad kept asking me did I make it lol. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was a little tart. Next time I will probably do only 2 tsp of the lime zest.. Other than that pretty awesome. :)

Very creamy and good.  Mine never did have the small bubbles on top and after cooking it for 20 plus minutes, I took it out.  So I too do not know how long you are actually supposed to leave it in the oven.  I might have liked a little more lime flavor and will work on that next time.  I did only 2 cans of condensed milk as suggested by other reviewers.

Fantastic!  Wonderfully tart and flavorful!!!  I ended up using a shortbread crust (store was out of graham cracker) and it was still amazing!  Thank you ever so much for making your recipe public.  =D

Like many on here, I searched and pondered before picking this one.  I also limited my creation to 2 cans of condensed milk, and 1/2 cup key lime juice (nellies old fashioned).  Topped it off with fresh made whipped topping and a lime slice.  It was a total hit and a total keeper!!!

Made this last night, was a little worried about how it was going to turn out because I only had 2 fresh limes in my fridge, but I had to have some key lime pie!  I used the juice from the 2 limes I had and substituted Roses sweetened lime juice for the rest.  I also only had light sour cream on hand, but I did have a box of Graham cracker crumbs, so I made my own crust.  I found like other reviewers that 2 - 14oz. Cans of the condensed milk was plenty(just make sure to get every bit of milk out of the cans). Baked as directed, but found mine took about 9-10 min, could just be my oven.  Yum!  This pie came out so terrific, I was worried for nothing!  Next time I will try using all fresh limes though, would like to see if it's even better.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I love how easy the pie was to make and it did taste pretty good, but I will say that the key limes were a little bitter for me.  I think the next time I will use regular Persian limes and it should be better.

I rated 5 stars based on flavor, texture, and how easy it was too make. With that said, I haven't eaten many key lime pies, so I can't make comparisons. I made it exactly as it says, except for the amount of condensed milk. I (as others have stated) used two cans, which was plenty. Any more and it wouldn't have fit in the pie. Topped with home made whipped cream. Delecious!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it was superb! I used a garlic press to juice the key limes which was 100x easier than hand squeezing them. I brought it to a friends house for supper and everyone loved it... What more can you ask for from a recipe? Thanks AnnRichardson!

This is a keeper! Everyone loved it and it was super simple to make. I used 20 key limes to get 3/4c...but they also sell key lime juice at some food stores!

So simple and so good!  I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I juiced exactly 1 lb of key limes to get 3/4 cup of juice.  I found them very difficult to peel but it was worth the effort.  I paired it with the Graham Cracker Crust Recipe I from this site.  Do refridgerate overnight for better texture and flavor; one hour is not enough time.

Excellent. I love this pie, and am experimenting with lower-fat versions (though this is still great compared to the egg-yolk-and-heavy-cream versions!) I've had good luck slowly substituting low-fat sweetened condensed milk. Also, this recipe is easy to increase for a 10" pie crust: 4 cups s.c. milk, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1 cup key lime juice, etc. My only comment is that i find the amount of lime zest a bit excessive (not to mention a pain to grate)-- I use about 1/2 T. zest, even for the larger recipe. Kudos to ANNRICHARDSON!

very easy to make. it never bubbled in the oven but it turned out fine. wasnt really my cup of tea but my parents raved about it when i brought it to christmas dinner so i was happy. i thought it tasted a bit to much like swetneer cond milk and not tarte enough, this was most likely due to the fact i used regular limes.

This pie recipe is amazing!  Not only is it the easiest pie I have made, but it is as authentic as I have ever had.  I made this for my dad for Christmas and he (and everyone else) raved about it for days. :)

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and am hooked on its simplicity and great taste! Making it again tomorrow for an office pot luck. One tip: make sure you chill for several hours (best if over night) for a totally firm and lovely pie. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was super simple. I ran out of condensed milk and had to make a substitution but everything still came out well. I did chill in the freezer and felt it tasted better when cold so you may have to chill a day or so.

We love this pie. This time I used only 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 8 oz cream cheese. plus used the 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used just a couple limes you don't need the full 3/4 cup and it still gives a very delicious tart flavor to the pie. Made my own homemade graham cracker crust... delicious...mmmm

I had to use regular limes and when i saw you only cooked it in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes I thought it was wrong. This is one of the easiest and best pies I have ever made.

What an excellent recipe!  I prepared it Thanksgiving for my husband who does not like the traditional holiday pies but who loves key lime.  I folowed the receipe exactly.  What an easy, creamy and delicious result. It was requested that I do another for Christmas by other family who enjoyed it also.

Doubled this recipe. Im going to attempt to freeze one. Used a garlic press to juice the limes after cutting them in half and quarters. Worked great. Prep time is longer when using freshly squeezed key lime juice, but worth the extra time. Best Key Lime Pie Recipe I've ever made or tasted.

This was incredably simple and yet amazing! I had trouble telling if it was done or not. The first time I made it, it was perfect, the second time it was a little mushy in the middle. Still good though, and it certainly got eaten. You may have to adjust the time according to your oven. Very good!

As a native Conch, this is by far the most authentic key lime pie.  Blonde Giraffe is the place in key west to go to get a key lime pie.  This pie is identical if not better.  We too, did not see bubbles come up when cooking and ended up baking for 16 minutes.  It came out beautifully.

I got TONS of compliments on this recipe.  I followed it exactly and didn't change any of the ingredients.  I found that the 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk was about 3 cans, unlike a few of the other comments left saying it was only 2 (maybe it was a size difference).  Just make sure you refrigerate this pie quite a bit before you enjoy!

Loved this recipe. Good and tangy - exactly what I was looking for. And it's super easy. I used fresh key limes and three cups of sweetened condensed milk (almost 3 cans). With the leftover filling - there was a good bit, I made 4 key lime pie cones using Keebler waffle cones that I wrapped in foil, stood around the edge of an oven safe saucepan and baked for about 10 minutes at 350. Be sure to remove the foil after baking so the cones don't get soggy.  After they were chilled, I topped with fresh whipped cream. My children loved them.

This was super easy and could be a quick way to make key lime pie.  The key limes that I got didn't have much juice so after trying to juice 4 of them I gave up and used bottled lime juice instead, which saved me a lot of time.  The first batch I made I stuck with the recipe with the lime juice change and I found it too sweet, so I modified what I had leftover and added some cream to it and another 1/4 cup of lime juice and that was much better.  I think next time I might use only one cup of condensed milk and use maybe evaporated milk or cream for the remaining difference.

Made this for a BBQ and everyone seemed to like it but I was disappointed.  It was so heavy!  I'm not a big baker so I try to follow recipes to a T.  I've only had key lime pie a handful of times and it was always a much lighter pie than this.  Those cute little key limes are time consuming to squeeze (even w/ a lemon squeezer).  I made Graham Cracker Crust I from this website and it was easy and yummy.  I will try a different recipe next time.

This recipe calls for 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk, which 3 cups is 24 OZ.  A can comes in 14 OZ.  So that's 1.71 cans.   I ended up putting two 14 OZ cans.   I have to say it was WAY too sweet and rich for my liking.   I'm gonna find a lighter recipe.  I think anything over 1 can is too much sugar.   ***However is was extremely easy to make this***

Excellent recipe! Best key lime pie I ever had! As others have stated, it takes about 30 key limes to make 3/4 cup lime juice. This pie is very rich - whipped cream is definitely a must. So good! thanks so much for this!

THis was my first time making a Key Lime Pie and it was very good as far as initial taste went. However, the effect of the citrus acid hitting the back of the throat was the only complaint I received after making this pie. Next time i'll try to curb the acidic effect of the lime juice by adding less of it and more lime zest.

This pie was delicious. I did uses 20+ limes, because I actually used KEY LIMES, not regular ones. It wasn't too tart. It was just right. I never liked key lime pie, but this one is just the best ever. It is SO easy too! I love it, and I will continue to use this recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing.

This is great. I have made this several times. I bring it to every summer bbq I attend. Here's the thing: key limes are VERY variable in the amount of juice they yield and in tartness so you need 1-2 lbs of limes and you must taste the filling as you make it. I start with 2 cans of condensed milk. If it's too tart I open up the second can and add to taste.

Perfect! Like other users I used 2 - 14 oz cans of sw condensed milk mainly because it is such a pain to measure.  This pie was fantastic.  I also have made mini-pies with the pre-made mini graham cracker pie crusts and it will make about 12.  Thanks!

I made this pie for our Chief's retirement party.  He is from Florida and key lime is his favorite.  He raved about this pie and even presented an award to me.  This was the simplest thing to make, it is absolutely delicious and tastes like the traditional.

This pie was insanely easy and delicious beyond belief. I don't have access to actual Key Limes, so I followed another reviewers suggestion and added a little lemon juice. The pie set beautifully, held shape and texture and was awesome plain. I will try various toppings with future pies. Just an excellent recipe all around!

Stop searching for the perfect key lime pie recipe because this is it! Amazing balance of sweet to tart and SO easy to make! I made a homemade graham crust which is really easy to do. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and it was absolutely perfect. Better than any other I've eaten bar none!

OMG was this good! I used 2 cans sweetened, condensed milk and left out the zest, but I really don't think it could have been better with it! What a simple, perfect recipe. We got a little anxious and ate some after only about 45 mins in the fridge. It was good then, but the next day after completely setting up - PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe! Making this again tonight for my monthly Girls' Dinner Club tomorrow!

I'm giving it 4 stars even though it didn't come out well as I hoped it would.  This is because I used regular condensed milk instead of sweetened milk, if it wasn't for the graham cracker crust it would've been very very sour.  I'm going to try this again

This pie is the best I've ever tasted! I got rave reviews from my family, and will definitely be making and sharing this recipe for years to come! I think using fresh-squeezed key lime juice is important, even if it takes some extra time. And the addition of sour cream is the key to amazing creaminess.

This pie is awesome! I also used two can of condensed milk and discovered an easy way to squeeze your limes. Roll them between your hand and the counter until they are soft. Don't be afraid to put a lot of pressure on them. The softer they are the easier it is to squeeze them. Cut them in half (not through the stem). Hold a half in your palm and use a fork to scrape the inside of the lime. The juice (and the delicious pulp) just pours right out! I found that I won't need nearly as many limes when I use this method. Delicious pie! I won't be using another recipe.

AWESOME!!!  I used this recipe to make bite-size treats and they were the hit of the party!  Use mini-muffin pan with paper liners; place mini vanilla wafer in the bottom and top with filling.  Bake as directed.  I removed the paper liner, placed on serving tray and put cool whip and fresh lime sliver on top....delicious.  One recipe made 60 bite-size treats!

Im not sure how key lime pie is supposed to taste like but it tasted great to me. Kinda strong at first. I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk and 20 squeezed keylime filtered through a screen filter. I did notice one thing, that i kinda has a little grainy texture.Like little mini pieces of sand or something. Not all over but i dont know if that is supposed to happen or not. Overall great pie.

This recipe was so easy I've made the pie twice already. I would have given it 5 stars but I made my own graham cracker crust. The 1st time I made I didn't have lime zest so I used a pinch of lemon peel. It was really good and sweeter than anticipated.  The 2nd time I used the lime zest and it gave the pie a little more of the tartness I was expecting.

Everyone in my family loved this pie, even the baby loved it!  :0)  I didn't have quite enough sour cream so I added in a few tablespoons of whipped cream-cheese spread I had on hand.  I believe that it improved the texture.  And it was so creamy!  Super easy too.  Juicing the limes was the hardest part, next time-I'll use the bottled stuff. ;)

This recipe is super easy. I'm not the best cook & trying to improve, so this was a great one to use. My grocery store didn't have key limes, so i had to use 4 regular limes. The tast is sweet and somewhat tart. It's just right. My husband raved over it. He said it was the best he's ever had. I will definately use this again. Surprising my mother in law with one tomorrow!

Absolutely PERFECT! Not too sour, not too sweet! Super duper easy. Loved that it was egg-less so I didn't have to mess with separating eggs, like other recipes I looked at had called for.

WOW, I was totally amazed that this set up nicely. I was soo worried because it was sweetened condensed milk that was the biggiest ingredient in the pie. Let me say. No more fear. Now My temp on the oven was a lot lower when read, so I just kept it in oven a few minutes longer. It was so nice, the flavor was excellent. It had that bit of tartness, then a bit of sweet. It was soo good. And I totally used Key Limes all the way in this recipe. There was really nothing I could say negative about this recipe. Okay 1 negative...it took over 20 something little key limes to squeeze the out the juice. But soo well worth it. I totally make a lemon pie with this recipe...yummy!!! Thank you.

Made this for a party we had for Memorial Day.... Everyone raved about it and the best part..... it took like 5 mins to make!!  Can't beat that!
I followed the recipe exactly, I used bottled key lime juice, the zest of one normal sized lime and a pre made graham cracker crust... So easy!

Very good with a few slight modifications:
-I made a homemade graham cracker crust, which is really simple and elevates the taste so much.  I used "Graham Cracker Crust" from this website.
-I used bottled key lime juice, as my local store did not sell key limes (and I'm too impatient to spend that much time juicing limes!).  Because of this, I also omitted the zest.  I'm not sure if this juice is a little extra potent or not, but next time, I will cut back ever-so-slightly on the amount of lime juice I use, as it was a little overpowering.
-I kept my pie in the oven for 11 minutes and it never bubbled.  It doesn't seem to have caused too much trouble though, as it has a nice firm texture after sitting in the refrigerator overnight.

Made my first Key Lime pie and it was great, it is one of my husband’s favorite pies and he loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was quick and easy. I also added Becky Leach’s topping recipe of 1/2 c. sour cream mixed with 1/2 c. conf. sugar.

This was good and flavorful. I made a homeade graham cracker crust. It was very sweet, a little too sweet for me. I think next time I will whip some whipping cream and put it over the whole pie to tone the sour/sweet down a little, but otherwise I have two requests to make more this weekend. Definitely a great recipe and worth a try.

This is the BEST key lime pie recipe!!! I have sampled many key lime pies over the years, and this is by far my favorite. I didn't change a thing the first time - perfect. Then, I quickly sqeezed more limes for a second pie and used one can of regular sweetened condensed milk & one can fat free. Poured it into a reduced fat Graham crust... Still perfect! This will be my new 'go-to' pie recipe.

I am not a baker but i love key lime pie and once or twice a year like to attempt a baking project. i surprised my boyfriend who does all the baking yesterday with this and he said i put his baking to shame and that it was wonderful. i had to bake it longer then the time though i was not getting those pin size air holes but i made sure not to brown it and it was perfect.

Excellent pie. I followed the recipe with no additions or subractions. I overcooked it because I kept looking for the little bubles on top...they never showed themselves. The pie still turned out good, but next time I will only back it 10 minutes instead of 15.

Great recipes. I bake for a local restaurant and have made this 4 times now. The first time I followed the directions to a T. It seemed a bit to tart for me, so I used 3 cans of sweetened cond. milk instead of 3 cups.  It smoothed it out just enough.  Customers rave about it.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I'm from FL and this is as close to the real thing I can make while living in New England. I used Nellie and Joe's key lime juice directly from the Keys/

Perfect recipe! I used an oreo crust instead and it went very well with the lime!

I baked this a second time around, using oranges instead, and it was equally yummy! The only exception was that somehow it was more runny than the 1st try with the limes, so I had to leave the pie in the oven longer until it reached the correct consistency.

FANTASTIC!  Sooooooo foolproof!  I was going to make my husband his favorite dessert - cheesecake for his birthday, and he's changed his request to this pie!  An awesome homemade graham cracker crust really makes a big difference too!  Save time on juicing limes by buying the juice - still tastes awesome!  I will make this over and over again!

This pie was fabulous!  It was so easy, too.  I've never cared for key lime pie but this one was so creamy and just sweet enough.  I think the addition of the sour cream gives it such a nice light texture and smoothes out the acidity in the limes some.  I used two full cans of the sweetened condensed milk, full fat sour cream and juice from those little Mexican limes.  I also squeezed one drop of green food coloring in it for a lovely pale green.  This will be perfect for Easter dessert.  Thanks for sharing this!
01/09/15 update!  I just discovered that there is an English dessert called Posset, which is a now a type of citrus pudding that is very similar to this filling recipe.  It uses sugar and heavy cream (double cream in England) instead of the condensed milk.  The principal is the same, the lemon/lime juice helps coagulate the cream so it firms up.  Very interesting!  I'd never heard of Posset before.  Just thought I'd share!

Fantastic - couldn't be easier to make & tastes perfect.

I used the recipe to make 6 mini pies in my jumbo muffin tin.  I used graham cracker crumbs to do the crusts (followed the recipe on the box for 1 pie crust).  I would have been better off making 8 mini's instead of six, though, as I had leftover filling and the crusts were quite thick.  Also had to bake for almost 20 minutes, 5-8 definitely was not long enough.

this was a big hit!  No changes.  I made in cupcake tins and it made about 14 individual 'pies'.  I topped with light whipping cream and a key lime sliver- looked fabulous too!

This recipe is great and easy to make.  However, the recipe makes a little more than you need for one 9 inch pie.  I cut it back to 2 cans sweetened condense, 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup key lime juice.

Super simple Key Lime Pie recipe - which is exactly how a key lime pie should taste!  I browsed through a lot of different recipes, and this had the fewest ingredients and was the simplest - Sometimes simple is best!

This pie is simply delicious. It was so easy to make! I had no time to squeeze 20-30 limes, so I used bottled lime juice instead. I thought it still tasted great. (This one was 10 times better than the one I had in Florida!) I ? this recipe!

Superb recipe!  I doubled the filling ingredients, because I was putting the pie in a 10-inch deep-dish.  I made my own graham cracker crust (doubled the usual 9-inch crust recipe for that, too) and pre-baked the crust for about 12 minutes.  Had some leftover graham cracker crust, so I placed it into small pudding ramekin bowls, with the intention to make a quick pudding dessert with it, but then I had just a 3/4 cup of filling that didn't fit in the pie dish, so I put the filling leftovers into one of the ramekin cups with a crust, and baked that for 8 minutes.  Needless to say, I could try out the pie before the large pie was done, thanks to this little sampler I created!  It's awesome!  Makes a great Packer Superbowl pie for today's football party, along with a bright yellow lemon meringue pie.  Go, Pack, Go!

Outstanding. I didn't make any alterations to the original recipe. I took the suggestion of one writer and used a garlic press to squeeze the key limes. What a great trick! People gobbled this up and I cannot wait to make it again.

I hate key lime pie, but it's my dad's favorite. Made it for a party for him and everyone said it was delicious! I followed it exactly though and it made too much. (And what makes no sense to me is 3 cups= 24 oz. yet, 2 14 oz. cans of milk measured out only to 1 2/3 cups?) So I bought 3 cans so I had enough and measured out 3 cups of the milk exactly. I probably should have listened to the comments about just using to cans because I ended up with too much filling and don't know what to do with it! Not enough for another pie. Also, the squeezing the key limes was PAINSTAKING. It's also cheaper to buy an equally good pie at the store (which is unusual for homemade food, I think.) Wish they made pre-squeezed key lime juice like they have regular lime juice! :( Good recipe none the less!

So easy and so good.  This was a hit and will be made again.  I used individual graham cracker pie crusts and it was a hit with some whipped cream on top.  Can't wait to make it again and make it seem like I slaved away in the kitchen.  =-)

I brought this to a Christmas potuck and it was a real hit!  A few people even came back for a second slice.   This is a smooth, creamy pie with just the right amount of tanginess.  Since my grocery store does not carry key limes, I used key lime juice.  Delicious and super-easy to make!

This didn't have enough lime "zing" for me.  If you like your pie with a creamier taste and texture, this is it.  This is only my 2nd key lime pie recipe I've tasted or made.  The other was made with F.F. cool whip, bottled key lime juice and FF sweetened evaporated milk.   That has a stronger lime taste and lighter cream taste.  Thank you for sharing.

Used low-fat sweetened condensed milk and sour cream.  Also used Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice instead of squeezing limes.  My prep time was no more than 5 minutes and I baked the pies in pre-made mini graham cracker crusts that came in a pack of 6.  I halved the recipe, filled all 6 of the mini graham cracker crusts and had maybe two tbsp of filling left over.  Rave reviews all around.

My daughter (8 years) had to make a pie for a girl scout type group. She made the pie all by herself! And, I really don't like key lime pie, but this was good! She used the individual (small) pie pans. She made 12 pies from the recipe. YUM!

Marvelous! I used reduced fat sour cream and 2 cans of condensed milk. I followed ljm4jr's advice and used a garlic press to squeeze out the juice. I ended up using only 8 limes! It's probably a bit more than 3/4 cup because the pie was a bit sour for my taste although hubby said it was very good. Thanks for sharing the recipe :-)

I needed something to take to a last minute potluck for which I was going to have no time to cook the next day. I had all the ingredients on hand and whipped it up in no time the night before - literally 3 minutes plus the cooking time. Easy, Simple, and most importantly, Delicious. 3 cups = 2 cans.

Very good! I also only used 2 cans of condensed milk, as suggested. I left out the lime zest...too lazy:)  I made my own crust: 1/4 c sugar, 1 1/4 c graham crackers and 6 Tbs butter. Yum!

It was AWESOME! First pie I've ever made and it turned out great, but i had a LOT of filling left, so i mixed some of it with a tub of cool whip, and add some more o the filling to a white cake mix and TA DAH i made a delicious Key Lime Cake!

I can't even begin to say how awesome this pie came out! I followed other recommendations of using 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, expecting them to make 3 cups. They only made 2 cups, but it looked like enough to fill my store-bought crust so I proceeded with the recipe, not changing any other amounts. The pie came out SOOOO GOOD! I like things tart so I thought the taste was perfect and it was so creamy! I made some homemade whipped cream with just a dash of splenda and vanilla so it wasn't sweet like cool whip. Everyone who ate this with me thought it was fantastic!

This is SUPER easy to make and delicious, I always get rave reviews whenever I make it. I did change one thing and made my own crust with graham crackers and crushed pecans pieces. But definitely try this recipe, you'll be hooked.

I'm not sure what but something tasted a little off to me in this recipe.  Maybe it was the freshly squeezed key lime juice?  Good recipe, just need to figure out how to tweak it to make it perfect.

AMAZING. for a bit of a change, you could try making it with a gingernut crust. Adds wonderful warmth and dimension to this wonderfully cool pie. I used 1/2 lime juice and 1/2 lemon juice because I did not not have key-limes.

Living in Arizona with a newly planted Mexican Lime tree full of fruit, I sought recipes using fresh limes to utilize the fruit that outnumbered our need from Mexican beer.  There it was "key Lime Pie VII".  As a desert after an evening of grilled delights, it was met with rave reviews.  I lacked the time for the homemade crust, but no one seemed to dampen their consumption as their forks scrapped the plates clean enough to return to the cabinets.  The fruit was  picked, pressed and pied within an hour.  It did take a lot of thumb exercise to squeeze the 3/4 cup of juice and like other reviewers, I used 2 cans of condensed milk.  Topping it off with fresh whipped cream had my daughters boyfriend rating it "amazing.". Thank you Ann for the recipe that will be used as often as our Mexican Lime tree bears fruit.

This was so easy and delicious!  I can't get key limes or key lime juice where I live, so just used regular limes and store bought lime juice.  I just added a little extra lime juice because it wasn't quite tart enough.  I think I'll add a little extra zest next time, but it does gets tarter over time.  I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk as others have recommended.  I baked it for only 10 minutes even though I didn't really see any tiny bubbles.  I refrigerated it over night and it set up great.  So creamy!  I topped it with Cool Whip which was a nice contrast to the tart.

This pie is great! Amazing flavor and so quick and easy.  I served this to friends and family and they were all very impressed.  Will definitely make it again.  However several people have said 2 can of sweetened condensed milk is equal to 3 cups.  I found that not to be the case.  It only gave me about 2 1/2 c.  I did use the 2 cans but wonder is I put that extra half cup if it would even be a little firmer that what it was.  It was still great consistence without it though.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very summery and refreshing. I didn't need as many limes as other reviews have been saying to get the desired amount of juice. Also, I added two drops of food coloring to get a green look. Very good and easy!

This pie has a great texture and is very easy to make. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk which turned out to be just right. My only complaint is I would have preferred it to be more tart. Next time I will try adding more lime juice to see if that solves it.

I could not find key limes or key lime juice in my grocery store.  So, I made this recipe with regular limes and (go ahead and gasp) real-lime bottled lime juice.  My pie turned out wonderfully well!  I served it at a party and everyone raved about it.

Very Good.  I used 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk, which was probably too much.  (14oz cans).  Turned out very sweet.  Did take longer to cook, but could have been the volume of pie.  Definately needs the balance of the zest with amount of sugar.  Can't wait to have it for breakfast!

This is a smooth, delicious key lime pie.  I used the lime juice in a bottle, because I just couldn't bring myself to squeeze 20-30 little limes.  If it wasn't good, I would have tried it again with fresh lime juice, but why bother?  It was wonderful!  The only other comment I have is that I do think it is just a little too sweet.  I may modify it a bit next time with that in mind.  There will definitely be a next time!

Wow!  What a simple, delicious treat!  I love the smooth texture and very lime-y flavor of this pie.  Because it's so rich, though, I'm going to try making it in a springform pan with a homemade crust to get more crust-to-filling ratio.  I ended up having to bake mine for closer to 15 minutes instead of the suggested 5-8.  The lime zest is pretty, but at $1 per lime, I don't think I'll add it next time.

This recipe makes a delicious key lime pie.  I make it all the time because I have found a short cut.  I used to make it with the key limes which was still easy when you compare it to most recipes but if you use regular limes along with one large or two small lemons it saves so much time and your thumbs.  Thanks for this great recipe that gets raves from everyone that tastes it.

This is the best key lime pie I ever tasted!  I followed the recipe exactly other than using a pre-baked pie crust instead of graham cracker.  Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper!

Wow!! What an awesome pie, and so easy.  I did add 1 cup of sour cream as to not have any leftovers in  the fridge.  The family just loved it!

This is the first time I have ever written a review after many recipes. I am not a baker by any means and tend to mess up sometimes. This recipe is SO easy. It is also delicious. I made it for a dinner party and a few people told me that it was the best key lime pie they had ever had. I ended up emailing this recipe to about 10 people. I also used the base of this recipe (condensed milk and sour cream) for chocolate pies and pumpkin pies. Very highly recommended.

This is such a great, easy pie! I really didn't think it would set properly but it really did become perfectly firm.  I used light sour cream and that didn't hurt the taste or texture one bit, it is still very creamy. The taste is divine; not too sweet but not too tart.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I won't be making Key Lime Pie any other way now!

So delicious and creamy! And incredibly easy to prepare. It is fairly tart though so it may be overkill for those who aren't big fans. I brought this to a BBQ and it disappeared in a flash!

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making a key lime pie for a Fourth of July party.  It was so easy to make and the taste and texture were perfect!  I also used a springform pan and let the pie chill overnight.  When released, it made for a beautiful presentation!  (Just make sure you spray the pan with non-stick coating before pressing the graham cracker crust in.  In addition, I baked the crust for five minutes at 350 before adding the filling.) After letting the pie chill thoroughly, I piped freshly made sweetened whipped cream on top and garnished with a lime wedge.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

I made this last night for our Fourth of July BBQ.  I also made another key lime pie from a different recipe just so we could compare recipes.  This recipe was the hands down winner!!  Everyone loved how creamy is was and that it wasn't too tart.  I did cook it on a cookie sheet and I don't know if that affected the cooking time, but I never did get the tiny bubbles to pop.  After 15 minutes, I just took it out and it was still delicious.  This will be my go to key lime pie recipe from now on!!

I think this is the best recipe on Allrecipes.com. It is easy, quick, and fabulous. I love that it has no eggs, but sets up perfectly. When I first read it, I thought liquidy ingrediant, liquidy ingrediant, and liquidy ingrediant= soup. But the acid in the lime juice sets off a wonderful chemical reaction and the results are smooth, creamy and wonderful. It's sets up right away- the texture when it is hot ouf the oven is the same as it will be after cooling. I've never had one weep or turn out soft. Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

This was so much better than I thought it might  be! Seemed like a  lot of lime juice, but ended up being the right ratio.  Instead of juicing limes, I used store-bought bottled key-lime juice.  I also used 2 cans (14 oz.) of condensed milk - with a store-bought extra large graham crust, the filling amount was perfect.  Baked for 13 minutes.  Chilled in freezer an hour before serving.  A delicious Summer recipe!

Delicious! I made my own graham cracker crust from this web site. I used bottled lime juice, I can't find key limes in Iowa and I didn't really want to squeeze a bunch of regular ones. Fresh juice would be better, but bottled worked just fine! It still tasted delicious! My friends loved it.

I have a very picky college kid who developed a love for Key Lime Pie after our family vacation, but no matter how many different ones we've tried, none met her standards until now.  I can't believe how easily this went together.  I got a 10 inch premade pie crust (instead of 9 inch) and increased quantities of all the ingredients just slightly with no problems.  We used bottled Mexican lime juice and it was way easier than juicing all those limes would have been.   Like several others have mentioned, during baking, it's hard to tell when those tiny bubbles show up - I didn't really see them - so I left it in the oven for about 10 minutes or so.  As long as it doesn't brown, it's fine.  I'm sure we'll be making this again, and may try topping it with meringue next time.  When you need a quick, super easy desert that is sure to please, this is perfect.

I LOVE key lime pie and I've made several key lime pie recipes from this site. This one is my favorite! I've made this one a few different times and I am always pleased with the turnout. I have made Key Lime Pie IX, and although it is also delicious, it is a bit too heavy because of the added egg yolks. This recipe does not call for any eggs and doesn't need it! I've also made this recipe with light sour cream and low fat sweetened condensed milk and it is still just as delicious. This pie is great because it takes no time at all to throw it together and bake. Everyone loves it!

I only gave 4 stars b/c I thought this was too tart but I have not tried a lot of key lime pies. Other than that, the recipe was perfect--very easy and perfect texture. Paired with some cool whip/whip cream it totally softened the taste. Someone suggested my key limes may have been not ripe enough (too bitter). The flavors seemed to settle more the day after so it wasn't quite so tart. I may try the lemon/lime combo next time that others used and will definitely use the bottled juice since many reviews said they didn't notice a difference.  I interpereted 3 cups of SCM to equal 24oz.--isn't that correct? I barely baked it and it was firm (maybe 5-8 minutes)it must be some type of chemical reaction btw all of the ingredients that firms it..served frozen. Very Good.

Such an easy and freakin delicious recipe!  Feel in love with it in summer 2009 and made two that summer.  I do have a couple recommendations/suggestions: 1) there is no taste difference between regular and fat free sweetened condensed milk. 2) 3/4 cup key lime juice is equivalent to Hot salsa     2/3 cup is equivalent to Medium salsa     1/2 cup is equivalent to Mild salsa 3) 3/4 cup sour cream will make it creamier, but will overfill the pie crust a little.   4) 10 mins max in the oven. 5) Use electric mixer to combine the ingredients, helps add air and fluffiness.  Other than that, its a rock solid, fool proof recipe AAA+ my friend

The absolute BEST key lime pie!!!  This tastes exactly like the key lime pie I have always bought at the market.  Search no further, this IS the perfect recipe, and so quick and easy to make.  I even tried is using low fat sweetened condensed milk and reduced fat sour cream with the same results.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, everyone I make it for raves about it!

This pie was delicious! LOVED the tip to use my garlic press to juice the limes. So easy! It took 20 limes and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. Not sure if the tiny bubbles came, so took out after 10 minutes. So EASY and DELICIOUS!

Superb summertime dessert and super easy!  This is one that I always make when the limes go on sale.  It comes together in minutes and is a great ending to a summer BBQ dinner out on the porch.  Everyone loves it!

I agree with other reviewers that low-fat/non-fat ingredients worked well. A word of warning though... I squeezed the key limes by hand and it dissolved my nail polish! The pie was delicious! I didn't tell anyone about the nail polish. ;)

This was wonderful. So easy and so delicious. It got rave reviews for sure. The only thing that I did was instead of using store bought crust I made a shortbread crust with butter and shortbread crumbs and added poppy seeds to the crust. I always add poppy seeds to my lemon/lime pie crusts, and it was perfect with this recipe.

Fantastic! I think this was the easiest dessert I have ever made and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as is, but next time I would love to make my own pie crust.

Incredible! Great texture, beautiful glossy pie. I love that it showcases the lime taste, with the sweetness not overpowering the citrus flavor. I made two of these yesterday for a cookout this afternoon, and between my husband and my father they'll probably both be eaten before the cookout actually starts.

This is such and easy and delicious pie to make.  I didn't have any Key Limes so I just used regular limes.  I'm sure it would of been even that much better with the Key Limes so when I can get my hands on some I'll try it.  Everyone loved it and it was a request again for our next get together.

Perfect.  Liked other reviewer's suggestion of using garlic press to juice halved key limes. Also homemade crust is a must: 1 1/2 C finely crushed graham cracker crumbs, 6 T melted butter, 6 T sugar.  Stir together, press on bottom and sides of pie plate firmly and bake @ 350 for 7 min.  Cool in fridge while making key lime filling.

BEST KEY LIME PIE!!! This pie is unbelievably easy and so tasty. I have vacationed in Key West and made it a point to try as many versions of Key Lime Pie while I was there. This was the first time I had made one homemade.....it tasted just like what I ate in the Keys. It's a PERFECT pie!

I made this for Easter dinner on Sunday.  This recipe is not only yummy but very quick and simple.  The longest thing about it is squeezing the key limes.  I used a metal mesh strainer over a glass measuring cup.  That way the seeds and pulp didn't get into the juice and I could use it as a press to work as much of the juice out as possible.  It took about 20 key limes for me as well.

Excellent key lime pie, tastes just like one from Florida!  I used key lime juice instead of juicing limes.

this recipe is amazing and so simple.  key limes are extremely hard to find by me so i just used juicy regular limes.  I only had to use 8 limes to get a little more than 3/4 of a cup.  This is by far the best key lime pie i have ever tasted.  It has the perfect amount of tang and it is so refreshing. great to have after dinner.  I bet it tastes even better with the real key limes!

Quick and easy.  I subbed bottled lime juice for key lime juice (couldn't find it at my store).  The pinholes appeared after about 9 minutes, but very tiny!  Don't expect "bursting" just look for little dots.  Aside from the slightly different lime flavor due to the substitution, flavor was great and the sour cream gave it a less custard-y, more creamy texture than one made with eggs.

this was the best key lime pie! I used a shortbread crust instead of the graham, the tart/sweetness from the pie,and the crunch/sweetness from the crust was great. I give this pie 10 stars!

I made homemade pie crust and whipped topping to go with this recipe. This was the easiest and best tasting pie I have made. I got rave reviews and have been asked to make this for a few upcoming events. Thank you so much for sharing this!! 26 Key limes = 3/4 cup juice for me.

Excellent pie. Tart, tangy, and a little sweet too. Just the right balance of all in this winner. I made a pie crust and topped this with homemade whipped cream. I was a half cup short of condensed milk and used evaporated to make up the diffference and this still turned out fine. This used a little over half a bag of key limes. Thanks for sharing this.

Absolutely flawless and too delicious for such a easy recipe. At first I found it to be too sour and sweet when eaten by itself, then I added a bit whip cream and voila, the perfect mix of creaminess, texture, tanginess and sweetness. I am making another one to take to girlfriend's house. I did substitute 1/4 cup of Persian lime juice for the key lime juice because quite frankly one bag of key limes from Publix barely yielded me 1/2 cup of key lime juice. Supposedly if one mixes half lemon juice and half lime juice, the flavor profile can be very close to one made with real key lime juice, will try that when I have a chance. Key lime is way too expensive where I am from (like $3 for one-lb bag).

This was just lovely! I made my own Graham cracker crust, which I think makes a huge difference! I didn't use a full tablespoon of zest, because frankly I got tired of zesting, lol! Everything else I followed exactly, though I did need to leave the pie in for longer than 5-8 min, more like 15-18. I made thus for my parents. My dad is a lime pie fanatic (very picky) and he said this was the BEST he'd ever had. My mom who really doesn't like lime anything also loved it. Friends tried it and loved. Overall it was a BIG hit. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is a keeper.

You really wouldn't think these ingredients would "bake" into a sliceable pie- BUT THEY DO! I made 2 pies at the same time. One with REAL Key lime juice (my thumbs hurt so much after that squeezing because I couldnt find the bottled key lime juice) and one with "regular" bottled lime juice. Both made beautiful and yummy pies that everyone at work loved, but the difference in the taste of the pies was significant enough that I would spend the extra time squeezing the real key limes. The taste of that pie was just that much yummier, although the other one still tasted good.  I had 5 colleagues ask for the recipe. With how simple it was, I almost didnt want to tell them!

This was a delicious hit! I chose to make my own Graham cracker crust in a spring form pan for a homemade look.  I also topped with creme fraiche to cut the sweetness- I will make this again and again...

absolutely AWESOME!!!!! So easy and taste wonderful!!! Had an idea for the filling....if you have alittle too much, as I did, I just poured it in a dish, and set out some graham crackers and my family ate on that instead of diving into the pie that was for a family get together...

Delicious! I would recommend adding a cup of lime juice instead of 3/4 though!

So good! I didn't use lime though. I used fresh passion fruit blended up and it was AMAZING!!! I live in Costa Rica and I'm always looking for different ways to use the fresh fruits that are abundant here. I also used coconut cookies for the crust. Everyone loved it!!

This was the best key lime pie I've ever had! Like other reviewers have suggested, I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. I wouldn't recommend substituting the key lime juice with anything else and the lime zest is an absolute must. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I have been looking for just such a recipe for years... My aunt had a restaurant in Florida that used to import it's Key Lime Pie from Key West, and it was always divine - this is incredibly similar. Thanks for the recipe. I used 2 cans of condensed milk (300 ml each) and 20 key limes (equaled exactly 3/4 cup). added just a dab of whipped cream (made using cream and a small amount of sugar) on each piece.

This was really good. I will probably cut back a little on the lime juice the next time I make it. A tidbit tart. But still great. Use to buy at the grocery store. Not anymore.

you have to love it when something so yummy is so easy, so fast, and made with ingredients you probably already have on hand.  I like to make this recipe sometimes with lemon juice and rind instead of the lime. I've made it as a tart instead of a pie, and right now I've got one in the oven in a rectangular dish so I can cut it into squares instead of wedges. also super simple to make this pie gluten free by making your crust from scratch using store-bought gluten free gingersnaps, amaretti cookies, or a mix of both, instead of graham crackers. enjoy! we sure do!

I'll never look for another key lime pie recipe.  This was perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks to the users that suggested juicing the key limes with a garlic press.  I also heated them in the microwave for about 30 seconds, and they juiced much easier.

Wow. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it is so rich and delicious! Absolutely worth the time zesting and juicing limes. I used a garlic press to squeeze out the lime juice and this made it much easier.

I made this once with regular limes, then a second time with key limes. I found the key limes to be a bit overpowering, so I'll stick to regular limes next time.  I used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and cooked for 10 minutes.  (never saw bubbles except around crust)  I also omitted the lime zest the 2nd time and  added 2 drops of green food coloring.

Excellent recipe.  I used lemon rind instead because that's all I had on hand.  This pie is great with a prepared graham cracker crust - it would be even more fabulous with a homemade one, as the author suggested.

Love this recipe!!  I used 3 persian limes (the only kind available at my grocery store), zested and juiced them, then used Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice to equal 3/4 Cup.  I used 2 cans of fat free sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 C. fat free sour cream.  I baked it for about 10 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I had to come back and write a review on this. Make it. Don't change a thing.  I live in Palm Springs, CA and we have 2 wild Mexican lime trees in the back yard. Wow...   they are in season now, and I used them for this.  Very Easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and used those Keebler graham cracker crusts on the store shelves which are not refrigerated. I beet and egg and  brushed the crust with the egg wash, then backed the crust for 8 min in a 375 oven. Cooled the crust, then added the batter, and baked the pie for 8 min more. I used Cool Whip dolloped on top after it chilled in the fridge for 3 hours...  Wow... Thanks! The perfect desert!

I'm not the biggest fan of key lime pie so I'm rating this based on my husband who I made the pie for. I followed the recipe exactly and he loved it. It was a pain to squeeze all those tiny limes but he said it was definitely better than before when I made it with the bottled key lime juice.

I also had to bake this pie a bit longer but it was perfect!!  Great flavor.  It really is rich though so you need to cut this into smaller slices than usual.  It is super simple to make yet it impresses your guests.  They think that you made an elaborate recipe.

I love key lime pie and I love sour cream but somehow this didn't quite come out right...was a little runny and bit sour tasting (rather than being tart).

This was great!! So easy and tasty. I didn't see many bubbles, but 8 minutes was still long enough. I didn't add the zest- still tasted great to me, maybe it will be even better next time with the zest! I also used a garlic press to juice the limes-- so much easier. I can't wait to make this recipe again!!

This pie is fantastic!!  Easy to make and delicious!!  However, I did have to bake the pie a little longer in order to see the little bubbles form on the top....about 20 minutes.  But still, a fabulous recipe.  Well done!!!

This is a great recipe- I cannot believe how easy it is. I used one can of nonfat condensed milk and one with full fat and then nonfat sour cream and it was still delicious. Mine did take a lot longer than 8 minutes to bake though- probably more like 20.

This is a great recipe, if you're looking for a creamy, rich key lime pie (that would be me)! :)  It almost has the consistency of a cheesecake, and I had several people ask if it contained cheese.  I used this recipe to make a dozen mini pies in my cupcake pan, and therefore made a homemade graham cracker crust (Graham Cracker Crust II on this site, is an excellent pair up)!  For "mini pies", I baked for 15 minutes at 350 F (or even 325 - my oven runs hotter than it states).  I had a slight problem removing them from the cupcake pan (even after chilling overnight), but that is no fault of this recipe.  I should have pre-baked the crust to harden more, and I should have also used paper liners.  This is such a simple recipe (albeit, juicing the limes is a bit painful), it's worth it. :)  I used regular limes, and only had enough to make 1/2 cup, so made sure to zest all 4 limes I had.  Great, strong lime flavor.  Easy peasy!

This pie is amazing, and so simple.  I did as other reviewers did and used 2 14-oz cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I used the amount of lime juice called for and thought it was perfect, I did hand squeeze key limes - it took a while but I don't think it would be quite right with bottled lime juice.  My only complaint about the recipe is the cook time, it really took more like 10-15 minutes to get the pinholes.

The recipe has worked out great everytime.  I always end up with extra filling, so I think next time I will cut the condensed milk back to 2.5 cups (and keep the lime juice the same!  (of course, I still have to try this).  Great recipe, everyone always loves it.

This might be the best Key Lime pie I've ever made, and I've made A LOT!   I used some key lime juice I got on a recent trip to Key West, FL which made it SO easy! (I used regular lime zest). Three cups of sweetened condensed milk is 2 2/3 cans, if anyone is wondering.  I saw the bubbles forming after 10 minutes in the oven -- they are easy to see if you look for their reflection against the light.  This was definitely a great pie.

We like the flavor of this key lime pie, but for me the consistency was just a little 'off'.  I'll keep looking for a recipe that is a little lighter in texture.

The taste was good but the color threw me.  It didn't resemble the look of key lime.  Also it was a heavier consistency than I expected - my came out close to a cheesecake consistency.

fantastic!!  great consistency, great taste, loved it!  can use lowfat condensed milk and would probably taste just as great.  oh, and i did put it in a "keebler graham cracker crust with 2 extra servings" (so a larger crust) and it fit perfect.  thanks!

Wow, so glad I saw this review on the Review page because I made it today!  I used fat-free condensed milk but I actually forgot the sour cream.  It's a tad bit tart but I think with the little bit of sour cream it may make it just right.  Thank you so much for posting this truly easy and delicious recipe!

I used bottled Key Lime juice and it turned out delicious! We've lived in Florida for 30 years and tried dozens of variations, but this is the best by far. So easy too. The little "bubbles" never happened for me, so I took it out after 15 minutes. The consistency was perfect! I made it as a surprise for our daughter's birthday. She had a store-bought Key Lime pie, but when we walked in with the homemade version, she was thrilled. She said it was the best homemade she'd ever had as well.

So easy!  I used 2 (14 oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk, 3/4 cup regular lime juice, and baked it for 13 minutes.  I never did see any bubbles form on the surface.  Topped it with homemade whipped cream.  It had the consistency of a creme brulee (minus the crusty top).  YUM!  Next time I'll try the lower fat/calorie ingredient options.  p.s. I wish I understood the science behind this recipe.  It's just so amazing to me that it bakes up nice and firm with only liquid ingredients and no eggs.  I've also made this into mini pies with the pre-made mini pie shells (fills 14 shells).  I made the graham cracker crust by pulsing 12 graham cracker (sheets), 5 Tbls melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/8 tsp salt into a fine sand. I made homemade whipped cream with 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and 3 Tbls powdered sugar and pipped a rose pattern over the entire pie. SO GOOD!! UPDATE: the grocery store was out of regular graham crackers so I bought a box of already crushed crackers. I used 1 1/2 cups, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/8 tsp salt and 7 tablespoons butter.

This was a real hit both times we've served it.  I used less of the condensed milk--just 2 cans-- no fat milk and low fat sour cream are fine substitutes.  One of our guests had spent time in the Keys and said this was better than the pies he had enjoyed there.

I rarely make desserts that are better than restaurant quality, but today this one really did it! I did not change anything in the recipe and it came out great. I used 2 cans of condensed milk (about 3 cups) and the consistency is thick and easy to slice. It had the right amount of sweet/tart and was just wonderful in every way.

I made this tonight for Father's Day.  Key Lime Pie is my husband's favorite.  Until now, I would try a new recipe each time.  We have found our standard!  I cooked it for 12 mintues as suggested and used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  Thank you!!

This pie was WONDERFUL! I grew up in Florida and have been looking for a recipe that tasted just like I remember it.....AND I DID....but I almost think this one is better!!!! It is so easy that the first time it came out perfect! No do overs here LOL! My Fiance' was born and raised in Tennessee (home of southern cooking) and he thinks this is the best pie he has ever tasted! I did use some of the hints like the 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk = 2 14 oz cans and if you use the real limes (instead of bottled juice)it's approx. 20 (that came in handy when shopping)But other than that the recipe is flawless! DON'T CHANGE A THING!! Thank you so much Ann for this delicious recipe!

I partly fault myself here for not using the highest-end ingredients - I could not find "key lime" juice so just used regular supermarket lime juice.  I also used a more generic brand of sour cream which may have had something to do with the flavor - there was something almost metallic about it.  I'll try this recipe again as I'm not overjoyed with the other Key Lime Pie recipe that I have...but I'll make sure to use the best ingredients next time...

My 14 year old daughter made this.  She LOVES key lime pie.  Neither her father or I are big fans of it so this is her rating.  It was easy enough to make without supervision for her.  We also did not get the pinholes popping or as she said pine holes popping.  We ended up with it in the oven for around 10 minutes then took it out.  It set up fine.

Over the years, my family has spent a lot of time in Florida.  I have tried a few Key Lime Pie recipes but could never achieve a result like a really good restaurant pie.  Well, here it is!  The zest makes the difference so don't leave it out.(I used the zest from one regular lime).  Others have complained about the juicing of the limes....you should be able to find bottled key lime juice in the juice isle at the grocery.  I live in the sticks and we have it here!  Also, the fact that there are no egg yolks involved gives it a much cleaner flavor.  Texture is unbelievably creamy.  I prepared with home made graham cracker crust and real whipped cream...AMAZING

This pie is fabulous!! The suggestion by one reviewer to use a garlic press, is not only smart, but also very thoughtful to pass that on! With my little rectangle press, I first put the half lime in sideways and pressed slightly, then flipped it pulp side down. I got the maximum juice from my key limes. I made 2 pies and used 40 little limes to make the 1 1/2 cups needed. This is now a "must" pie for all family gatherings!

OK... I have never written a review before. But, I felt the need to write one for this recipe because I almost didn't make it. This would have been a mistake because it is WONDERFUL! The reason I almost didn't make it was because I thought there was a mistake in the recipe. I kept reading the ingredients over and over wondering if the egg yolks had been left out. I couldn't understand what would make the filling "set". Sour cream, lime juice and condensed milk are very runny ingredients and there was no "binding" ingredient. Boy was I wrong. When the lime juice is added to the ingredients it creates a reaction and almost intantly thinkens the filling and baking it completely sets it.You can actaully serve the filling without baking. I actually served my hubby some leftover filling (that didn't fit into the pie crust)in a martini glass garnished with some graham cracker sticks and some fresh whipped cream. Since it doesn't have any egg in it, it was perfectly safe to eat. Very quick and YUMMY!

This was very good! I would recommend using between 1-2 tsp. of lime zest rather than a Tbs. I baked the pie for 8 minutes and it was perfect. I also bought lime juice instead of squeezing them myself and there were no problems with the taste!

The key lime flavor was nice but it was far too sweet.  Three cups of condensed milk was too much--the pie actually had a gritty texture from all of the sugar.  Would not make again.

I was never a big fan of key lime pie, because of the tartness, but it is my mother-in-law's fav pie. I made this for her birthday, followed faithfully on recipe. The hardest part was squeezing the juice out from the tiny key limes (about 22)even though I used a garlic presser to help. Not to mention getting the zest out first was a big pain. I couldn't fulfill the required quantity, just shy of some because my fingers were so sore from grating the tiny fruit. Everything else after that was a walk in the par. My pie didn't turned out white like the image shown, becuase of the color of my condensed milk which was yellow. I wanted to make a double batch since I bought 2 cookie pie crusts, but with the tedious retrieving lime juice part, I stuck to making only 1. I didn't get to taste it because I gave it away as a present. My mother in law who just turn 78, told me that it is the best key lime pie she has ever tasted! She gave me a piece, and Boy! it was FANTASTIC! I might make it again if I forget how hard it was to squeeze those limes!

This pie is delicious!! I have made this twice within the last couple of weeks for family and friends, and they loved it. Key lime pie is my favorite dessert, and I couldn't believe how easy it is to make. I made a few changes to make it lower fat.  I used 1 can of regular sweetened condensed milk and 1 can of fat free. I used low fat sour cream and a low fat pre-made crust.  I cheated and used pre-squeezed lime juice, and also left off the lime zest. I baked it for 12 minutes. It was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

This was easy and super delicious! It tasted just as good as any I've gotten in restaurants. I served mine with a raspberry sauce (1 10-oz package of frozen raspberries, thawed, then run through a food processor until pureed) and used a store-bought graham cracker crust. You could buy Key Lime juice in the grocery store, usually near regular lemon juice so there's no need to squeeze those little limes! I will definately be making this one again.

FAT FREE SUGGESTIONS. I made this using the recipe and lofat sour cream and it was GREAT, and with FAGE 0% Fat free greek yoghurt and it was GREAT as well. I'm always interested in eliminating fat from my diet and the FAGE did that really well. It's a great, flavorful substitute for sour cream in many recipes. It won't separate because the whey has been removed.

I can't comment on the authenticity of this pie as I've never eaten the true Floridian version, but it was tangy and yummy and so easy.  I used regular limes and it only took 6 to reach 3/4 cup, and I used low-fat sour cream in a weak attempt to make this slightly less sinful.  It baked for about 12 minutes and came out perfect.

This was pretty good.  I did use only 2 cans of condensed milk (which was about 2 1/2 cups).  It turned out fine.  I might reduce the key lime juice next time since I used slightly less condensed milk.  The pie was very full but there wasn't any extra filling.  This was definitely a quick and easy recipe and tasted quite good as well!

With more than 150 outstanding ratings, this recipe doesn't really need another positive review, but I was so blown away by the ease and taste that I had to add my own endorsement. As with others, I never could actually see small bubbles on the top, so I took it out of the oven after about 13 minutes. The texture was perfect. I had been looking for a reliable key lime pie recipe, and this is it!!! No need for further searching! This is now my first choice for dessert when I'm hosting dinners at my house.

SOOOOOO good! I love this, and so does my family. I'm about to make my third one this month. Don't you just love the holidays?? The only thing is, I use a regular homemade pie crust and not prepared graham cracker crust, but that's just personal preference.

Awesome recipe! This is the first (and only) recipe my caterer mother-in-law has asked me for in 20 years! 2 cans of condensed milk seems to be the right amount and I also have better luck with the recipe using bottled key lime juice instead of assuming I'll get good key limes in Kansas.

This is a great recipe, but I used normal limes.  Much easier to squeeze and it only took 4 to get the 3/4 cup.  As for the little pinpoint bubbles i did not see them pop up so i took it out of the oven after 15 mins.  I am new to cooking so maybe they were there but too small to see?  I have made this 3 times since and my family and friends love it.

My husband loved this pie so much he told me I had to rate it! He's traveled all over the world and said this is the best pie he's ever had. I didn't change anything. It was the simplest recipe and just delicious. Very impressive as well. I brought to thanksgiving dinner! 
 Don't try any other recipe. This is the perfect key lime. Tangy, light, and yummy!

This pie is fantastic! It is rich, creamy (not dense) and easy to make. An absolute keeper. I used Rose's lime juice - found in the drink mix aisle at the grocery store. Made it even easier.
Thank You for this recipe!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and just got back from dinner where it got rave reviews. Just delicious. Very tangy, wonderful texture. Loved it. Used fresh lime juice and made 1 1/2 times the recipe and it fit perfectly into my oversized 9.5 inch pie pan. Highly recommend.

Very good, tried it out on friends who love key lime pie and they said it was the best they ever had. I also used 2 cans of the condensed milk which was just under 3 cups.

There is a reason this is rated so highly.  It is the BEST Key Lime Pie that I have ever had!  I am not a big Key Lime fan, but my husband is.  He raved about it and so did my father who has never eaten Key Lime Pie before.  It has never been something that he thought he would like.  Well, the entire pie was eaten and I will be making this again.  I did not make any changes.  Next time, I will consider making mini individual key lime pies.  Thanks!!!!!

This is the first key lime pie I have liked. So Good. My husband's favorite pie and he raved about this recipe. However, next time I will buy Nellie and Joe's 100% key lime juice. Those little suckers are a pain to juice! Love the zest in the pie though.

I've now made it with actual key lime juice that I juiced myself, and with just plain old lime juice in a plastic lime-shaped container.  Both times it was delicious!

Can't say that I've ever had Key Lime Pie but hub was rattling on about how good it was for years.  Told him to look out for the limes and bring them home.  Well, I am SO glad that he finally found some where we live.  The only thing keeping me from making it over and over would be finding them again (although I read the reviews about using the concentrate and will try).  I needed something to bring to a potluck and pie isn't easily cut up for a crowd.  I used an 8x11 glass dish and baked it for the full time.  It came out perfect.  Just the right sweetness to tartness.  There was just enough left for us to have a taste of such perfection.  Thanks for a classic keeper!

I make key lime pie all the time for family occasions because my in-laws love it.  I just tried this recipe for the first time and it turned out fabulous.  I also made homemade crust instead of store bought.  update: Okay so I have made this a few times now...and I think it is too sweet.  I love the consistency though.  i think i am going back to my old recipe

I tried out this recipe for a church pot-luck and I was a HUGE success! I am asked to make it EVERY WEEK for the fellowships! I also make the "low fat" version by adjusting the ingredients to the lower fat counterparts, but it is great all around! Mine doesn't bubble, but the consistency will thicken enough to tell. Also, I am overseas sometimes ingredients aren't always available in the military commissary, so I used frozen limeade concentrate. Outstanding! Thanks!

I made this last week and it was so yummy. I took the advice of someone on here that said that she used limeade concentrate instead of the key lime juice and it worked perfectly. Not as tart as key lime juice but none the same, it was great. I also only used 2 cups of the condensed milk. Had I ued 3, it would have been way too sweet. I would definitely make this again.

Wow, this was so easy and so good!  I cheated and used bottled key lime juice.  I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk, one regular and one fat-free.  The finished product was a tiny tiny tiny bit too lime-y for my taste, but my key lime juice said "double strength," so I blame the juice.  I'll use real key limes next time!  I baked it for about 12 minutes.  Thanks!

This turned out amazing! I made it for my family when they were in town visiting. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The only thing I changed was I cut back on the rind to 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. I also added a little green food coloring to give it the lime feel! But a fantastic recipe. I will defintely make this one again. If you like key lime pie, TRY THIS!!!!

Best recipe hands down! This was so quick and easy, but tastes bakery/restaurant quality.  I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and I bought Key Lime Juice from the store, then just used zest from a regular lime. Everyone was impressed. Thanks for the recipe!

My kids each made one of these for my husbands birthday and everyone loved it. My husband thought we were crazy to make them when President's Choice is so good, but he changed his mind after tasting it. It was very easy, but I give it only four stars because it is so rich and not healthy...for a treat though, it is certainly good.

Delicious!  Light and not too sweet.  I used an imitation sour cream to alleviate the amount of cream for my roommate's sake.  Turned out very nicely.  I also made the pie into individual pie tins (the mini guys).  TASTY!

This is one of those recipes that we wish we could give more than 5 stars to.  At first I was reluctant to try it because of all the time it would take to get the juice off of those key limes.  I'll tell you what..  It went by quickly and it was so easy.  The result was something deserving of company.  I don't think I'll be able to keep this one just as a summer dessert.  It is an year around and Holiday one!  I didn't change a thing.  Awesome recipe Ann!  Thank you!

Easy and yummy! I admit I was lazy and used standard limes instead of key limes, but it was just a delicious! I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and used a homemade graham cracker crust. Baked 8 minutes (no bubbling like the recipe indicated) and threw it in the freezer because I couldn't wait for it to cool and have a bite! It holds up very well and tastes perfect!

A great recipe! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, though, because for something like key lime pie, you need to make it as sweet or as sour as reflects your preference. I added a little bit of lemon juice, splash of vanilla, and heavy whipping cream to my filling. I highly recommend making a homemade graham cracker crust, which I did, and I added a pinch of cinnamon to my crust as well. After the pie was out of the oven, I added an even sprinkling of crushed graham cracker crumbs, lime zest, and a twisted lime for decoration in the center. I served with homemade whipped cream on the side. The result was fantastic. Everyone raved about the pie and one key lime fan said it was the best she'd ever had. A great recipe, but remember to change it if you think it's too sweet or too sour as is - everyone has their preference.

Delicious! I used 2 cans of condensed milk and instead of sour cream used vanilla yogurt. I also used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust recipe for the crust instead of a graham cracker which I didn't have. Didn't have any zest, but I don't think it needed it.

This pie was superb, just what I wanted. As someone else said, it isn't very sweet - it lets all the key lime goodness come through. Perfect for a summer dessert.

The only modification I made was to add one egg yolk into the mix. I had seen it in other recipes, and wanted to make sure it set up good.

It set up perfectly, able to hold its own but still nice and creamy. Good with a little whipped cream to give you an alternate flavour from the sharp, delish lime.

Smooth & Delicious! Great lime flavor in this pie... instead of squeezing 30 key limes, I used a key lime juice purchased in the produce section. No problems with bubbles - definitely recommend using with "Graham Cracker Crust" also found on this site.

I made this recipe for Memorial Day weekend and it was a hit.  Everyone said it was the best key lime pie they had ever had.  It was delicious recipe without any changes.  I have been requested to make it again very soon.

Wow!  I made 2 of these for a BBQ this weekend and they were a hit!  Made exactly as written.  I know it's a lot of work squeezing those limes (had to do 40 for 2 pies), but it's well worth it for this.  Loved the creamy texture (almost like a custard) and it had the right balance of sweetness to tartness.  Filled in the Graham Cracker Crust I from this site and topped with a light layer of whipped topping.  I got so many compliments on this pie - this is a keeper!

This was very tasty.  I did change the amount of condensed milk after reading so many reviews about the sweetness being a bit strong.  I used 1 can of condensed milk which is about 1 1/2 cups.  Everything else I kept the same in the recipe.  I will definately be making this again.

I used a 'Nilla wafer crust, 2 cans of the milk, and an extra 2 tablespoons of lime juice. I also used a microplane to zest the limes. I had a little extra filling, so I baked it in a small glass dish and crumbled graham crakers on top to get a preview of the pie...very rich, sweet/tart, and  yummy. And no worries letting kids taste the batter since no eggs were used.

Very rich but tasty. I thought it would be simple to make, but it took FOREVER to squeeze those idiotic limes and zest them...it would be much easier to pre-squeezed juice. I loved the fresh lime taste, though...

Someone said this recipe called for about 20 limes.  I found that 9-10 limes was plenty!  It was an amazing recipe and really easy to make.  Everyone loved it and I will make it again soon!

I live in Florida and have had plenty of key lime pie in my life. I loved this pie...it was not too sweet and looked perfect. I made two, took one to work and have had many requests to make more by co-workers.

I prefer the dense creaminess of this kind of key lime pie over those that are all fluff.  However, all the sweetened condensed milk was a bit overpowering & sugary.  It was hard to enjoy the lime taste.  I also liked that there was no gelatin or food coloring added.  But I'm going to try Key Lime Pie VIII next time as it has a mixture of the milk and whipping cream.  If you're looking for a crust, I made Graham Cracker Crust II.  It doesn't require sugar so it goes well with this pie recipe, which definitely doesn't need more sweetness!

When doing cupcake size, make crust from 1 1/2 sleeves graham crackers, about 1/3 cup walnuts and about 1/4 teas cinnamon. Process well. Add about 6 Tbs melted butter while running food processor. Put 1  and 1/2 Tbs crust into bottom of cupcake wrapper. Press down with 1/4 cup measure. Use larger scoop (standard cupcake) to fill to near top. May need to add a bit more. Bake at 350 for 4 minutes, turn then 3 minutes more. Cool in cupcake tin for at least 10 minutes then remove to wire rack. Cool on counter for at least 15 minutes then move to fridge. Makes 16-17

My son loves key lime pie so I tried making this for his birthday.  It was so easy and everyone loved it.  I have to admit, I'm not a key lime lover, but this recipe wasn't as bitter as some that I have had and even I loved it.  Thanks!

Absolutely love this recipe. We are key lime pie lovers in my house. I used pliers to squeeze all the limes (definitely helps your hands from hurting). They also freeze well, without whip cream!

I used fresh key limes for the juice, which took awhile, but it seems to have been worth it. Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe specified, since I don’t really know anything about key lime pies. My husband cannot stop raving about it (it has been almost a year since I made it for him), and had multiple pieces day of, and for every meal until it was gone. Not really a typical reaction for him.

I made this pie exactly as was instructed, and it was indeed as easy as it sounds. My only complaint is that it was WAY too limey. 3/4 cup of fresh lime juice made it so tart I could hardly eat it. Some of the people who ate it said it was tasty while others agreed with me that it was too strong. I love how easy this was to make, and the pie consistency was excellent, but if I make it again I'm going to use about half of the recommended lime juice and see how that turns out.

This was such a simple recipe for such a delicious pie. I had extra limes and what a better way to use them up. I would not change a thing. I made the Key Lime Pie for a potluck and it was a hit! I will make this again and again!! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! ??

It tasted incredible but did not gel. Not sure what I did wrong. I let it bake for 10 minutes and it stayed in the fridge all day. I give it 5 starts because I’m sure I did something wrong and it’s not the recipes fault.

Very tasty consistency! I tweaked the recipe a little by adding  1 teaspoon of vanilla & I added 1 cup of lime juice to get an tangier flavor because I love limes! Great recipe! Will definitely try it again.

One of my best friends introduced me to allrecipes.com with this recipe. We make this pie for all sorts of office celebrations...mainly birthdays and on St. Patrick’s Day. Three (3) drops of food coloring are added to brighten it up and we make homemade whipped cream using heavy whipping cream.

This was my first time making it this way. I love it. If your Pie isn’t turning out right I believe your doing something wrong. I never had to put it in the oven. I thought it was going to melt. It came out the oven perfect.

Super easy, and NO EGGS.  I didn't know how it was going o thicken up enough, but once all the ingredients were combined it was perfect and super silky and delicious.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is by far the most delicious, the easiest and the most authentic-tasting Key Lime Pie I’ve ever made. And I love Key Lime Pie. I’ve made it at least a dozen times and I always get rave reviews. I didn’t change the recipe at all... the only thing I did differently is that I made my own graham cracker crust (use one of the three graham cracker packages that comes in a box of three, crushed very fine in a food processor or put in a zip-lock bag and crushed with a rolling pin, mixed with 3 tablespoons melted butter and 3 tablespoons sugar then pressed into the bottom of a 9” springform pan). When the pie is cooled, remove the springform ring and keep it in the freezer. I like it more firm and chilled. Perfect. ??

Fantastic recipe and so so simple!  I used regular limes as I have an over abundance of them from two trees. I also prefer a regular crust . Just had a piece, yum! Will keep making while my tree is dropping limes!

This was so easy I didn't expect it to be as delicious as it was. I opted to make my own homemade graham cracker crust and whipped cream. I followed the directions as is and it was absolutely perfect. My family loved it so much I had to make a second one. Thank you for sharing!

Love, love, love this recipe!  
I have made 4 pies total at 2 different times and they always turn out perfect.
Easy, tart, and tangy!
Tried it with Plain Yogurt+1/2 tsp Baking Soda instead of the Sour Cream today cuz I didn’t plan ahead and wasn’t going to go out to buy Sour Cream on Christmas Day! I’ll let y’all know how it tastes!

This is one where you can actually believe the reviews...AMAZING!!!! Seriously my husband who doesn’t love key lime pie loved this. Like other reviewers I too bakes for 10 minutes and possibly could have done a minute more but I was afraid of browning it. This pie was to die for and SOOOO easy!

This gets rave reviews everytime I have made this....and I make it quite often. Always a little better when you use real key limes but they are very hard to find.  Key lime juice works well too.

This was delicious with the right tart flavor. The 3 cups of condensed milk was confusing. A can of sweetened condensed milk is 14 ounce net weight and equal to 8 fluid ounces. I used two 14 ounce cans and it was more than enough for my pie shell. My pie also never bubbled, so I kept leaving it in the oven and it cooked for 20 minutes. It never browned and was perfectly fine and somewhat light.

Wow wow wow.  Big hit when I made this yesterday. I made exactly as written, it did take 20 key limes to get to the proper measure. Pie was tad tangy with just perfect sweetness if that makes sense.   Don’t change a thing and you will be very happy with this pie!

Huge hit. Everyone said it was the best key lime pie they’ve ever had! Fresh limes are a must IMO. I used four small bags. I didn’t bother with too much zest. This recipe is simply amazing. Juicing all of those limes is worth it.

This recipe has potential, but it was WAY too bitter. Almost inedibly bitter. Even after adding about 2 cups a sugar I could not balance out the tartness. Id reccomend using only a teaspoon of zest and maybe only a half cup of lime juice.

This KL pie puts all others to shame. It is seriously amazing! The lime, sweetness, and texture are so perfect. Every time I try KL pie at a restaurant now, I am disappointed, because none have ever been as good as this recipe. I share it with everyone. It is seriously so perfect!

Made a homemade graham cracker crust with peacans. The peacan crunch really added a nice texture. Topped with homemade whipped cream.

Recipe was perfect - consistency and sweetness were just right.  Used magnolia sweet condensed milk which although the can stated 14.50z, required 2  1/2 cans to make 3 liquid cups.  Everyone who tired it loved it.  This will be a go to staple for me.

This pie was insanely good. I made mine in a spring pan i use for cheesecakes and it held up perfectly. What surprised  me the most was how creamy it was, the texture was to die for! When i look up recipes i always check the worst reviews first, i don't know what people did wrong but it defiantly was not watery or to tart. Perfect and delicious.  Will 100% be making this again.

Making this again today.  It is quick and easy.   Most of all..this pie is delicious!!!  Make my own graham cracker crust, but use Nellie and Joe's juice.  Also, garnish with whipped cream and twist the lime slices.  Everyone loved it.

Has a strong tart but not sour. I made two this weekend and it was a hit. I live for key lime pie. Almost all gone. Substituted for a store bought gram crust, canned whipped cream, and bottled key lime juice. Made it a 15 minute recipe for both.

Just finished making this very easy recipe.  I had two cans of condensed milk which were 397grams each which did not make 3 cups, so you really need another half a tin. I also had to bake it for ten minutes. The pin holes are difficult to see but they are there. Great recipe. I also used about 10 West Indian limes which used far far less than the key limes other people used.

I didn’t realize how incredibly sweet this is. I’ve never had key lime pie but my 8 year old asked for it and I was happy to oblige. This was so easy to make I can’t see giving it less than 4 stars- plus my family really liked it (they love sweets) but this was just a tad too sweet for me to fully enjoy. However, I’d make it again in a heartbeat if someone asked:)

I will definitely make this Key Lime pie again. How can something so easy  be so yummy? All i can say is...it is! Our grocer has a sale on limes this week: 3 for $0.99. and even though the sign said “large limes” they are actually somewhere between the size of a Key lime and a regular one. Seven limes rendered the necessary 3/4 cup juice. Note to self: buy the larger size graham cracker ready-made crust because this recipe filled 1-1/2 regular sized pie shells. I’m glad I read several reviews because I altered the time in the oven to about 15 minutes and never did see any tiny bubbles surfacing but I did notice the edges becoming the palest shade of brown so I pulled it out. After cooling for 3 hours it was perfectly set and ready to enjoy. Even my husband who views himself as a Key Lime Pie aficionado raved about it. Cool, silky, limey tart and sweet accompanied by the crisp, buttery goodness of the graham cracker crust!

This pie is SO easy and so delicious. I just use 2 standard sized cans of condensed milk and add a splash of vanilla. It's still delicious even if you forget the zest. I've made it four times now and every time I get so many compliments. People can never believe how quick and easy it is to whip up! Highly HIGHly recommend this - especially for novel bakers. Nearly fool proof!

I made this for the first time for a dessert auction that was a fundraiser for my church. The pie sold for $60.00!!!!!  And I’ve had multiple requests to make another one for the next church dinner. My husband and daughter absolutely love it!  The only change I made was making my own graham cracker crust instead of using a store bought one.

My boyfriend and his adult son said it was better than the one they had in Key West. I used 3 medium-sized limes for zest, the juice of the fresh limes, and supplemented with bottled key lime juice. I used a 10-inch store-bought crust, and this recipe filled the crust with just enough room for piped whipped cream. You need three cans of condensed milk; I'm glad I had an extra can in the cupboard. Even I liked it and I'm not a fan of Key Lime Pie.

It was a great authentic florida key lime pie.  Next time I personally will use more lime juice.  It wasn't tart enough for us.

I am not a fan of lime in general so this review is based off of my husband and daughter. From an easy standpoint this recipe was ridiculously easy. Minimal ingredients and minimal work goes into this simple and delicious recipe. I ate one bite, they each had a slice. I cheated and used key west lime juice in a bottle, I know it isn’t the same as fresh but it wasn’t cost effective to buy limes. It ended up baking for 8 mins to get the pin holes. I let it cool for a bit before I put in fridge to get cold for after dinner. It came out in the pie shape after cutting it. I would make again for the ease of prep work. I personally am not a fan of lines. Otherwise it definitely deserves its 5/5 stars.

Two 14-ounce cans do not make 3 cups.  So you have to use part of a 3rd can.  Also, I used a 9”glass Pyrex dish and the filling is a little too much, so pour carefully or you will rise above the graham cracker crust.

Followed the recipe exactly, baked for 10 minutes (until tiny bubbles began to form) and took to a volunteer meeting where it was devoured and everyone loved it. Simple and easy recipe. Thanks for sharing this, will definitely make again and again.

I have made this several times and everyone loved it. Each time I've been told by at least one person that it is the best key lime pie they have ever had. I made the crust using Keebler Graham Cracker Crumbs, and followed the recipe that came on the box. (I have used both key limes and regular limes on separate occasions, and in my opinion the regular limes yielded a better result. About 4-6 regular limes should give you 3/4 cup of lime juice when using a lime juicer.) STRONGLY RECOMMEND

Excellent recipe for my husband's favorite pie. I made it exactly as written and the flavor was wonderful. Served it with home-made whipped cream (unsweetened because the pie is SO sweet) and it was truly luscious.

Head's up - the only deviation was that it took much longer than 8 minutes to get it to set - it was in the oven over 15 minutes, closer to 20...no sign of browning, and texture was perfect.

Best key lime pie I ever made.  I did use 3 cups of condensed milk.  The cans here in Ontario are measured differently.  I also used regular limes instead of key limes.  It took the juice of 6 large limes.  I baked the pie for 10 minutes, because I couldn't detect any bubbles on the surface.  Super easy and delicious!

Turned out great!  Delicious.  I have always been a key lime lover.  But now, Because of my lactose intolerance I made it with coconut condensed milk and non dairy sour cream.  I think the coconut took it to another level!   A lot of work squeezing those key limes but well worth it!

I'm new to making pies, I absolutely love Key Lime pie and gave this recipe a shot.  WOW just WOW this is by far the best Key Lime pie I've had.  I didn't change anything to the recipe and it turned out perfect.  I made my own graham cracker crust to boot.  
My local store sold Key Lime juice $2 for 16oz so I went that route.  I did zest a good tbs of lime for the pie.  My girlfriend recommended an N2O whipped cream dispenser versus making whipped cream by hand.  My parents stopped by to drop off some items and helped finish off the pie.  I couldn't believe how easy this was to make.  

I'm going to make several of these for our company party next week.

Huge thumbs up.

Very easy to make, did bake it for longer than specified to set. Flavor was good but got better as it sat in the refrigerator. Would make it several days prior to serving for best flavor.

This is the best key lime pie I've ever made or had. Only suggestion is to taste to make sure the key lime taste is where you want it. The first time I made it it was a little over powering not too bad. The last time I had to add a couple limes. I think it just depends on the key limes. That's all. Love it! Easy.

I’m a Florida gal who will never order Key Lime pie out again. This is the PERFECT pie! I made my own crust using graham crackers, pecans, brown sugar and butter. This combo is the ultimate pie and so very easy. I made two last night for a dinner I attended and the men who typically don’t like Key Lime pie said it was amazing. I have two more cooling now!

Mine didn't set at all. After 4 hours in the refrigerator, I poured it back out of the crust and added 3 eggs and rebaked.

This recipe was very easy to follow and my pie was excellent.  It did take about 10 minutes to cook instead of the 5 to 8 noted in the recipe though and the bubbles were a bit hard to detect, but they were definitely there.  I made my own graham cracker crust instead of using a prepared one; it's really easy and makes me seem like more of a culinary badass.  I will definitely make this one again!

I made this pie for two Floridians.  Before we ate it, one declared that 90% of key lime pies are disappointments.  THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!  I made as recipe stated---but with a homemade graham cracker crust that was thicker with more flavor/texture than store bought.  Topped the pie off with whipped cream.  Couldn't have been easier or tasted better at a summer cookout.

I followed the directions & it was delicious! Definitely a keeper. The hardest thing was squeezing out the juice of the tiny key limes, so I borrowed a vice grip from my husband's garage & it worked beautifully! It now resides with my kitchen tools!

This pie is not tart.  I use  Nellie and Joe's bottled lime juice and use exactly 3/4 cup.  My family are serious foodies and eat out alot.  They love this recipe more than any other key lime pie out there.  I have made it dozens of times.  (I top it with homemade whipped cream)

I made a different key lime pie recipe with an egg and it turned out to look too yellow and not be light and airy. This recipe was very easy to follow. I got nervous that it was too watery but after mixing for a bit it comes together nicely. Overall it's a very good pie!

I made this for Eid dinner with a gluten free premade crust. I couldn't find key limes so I used about 10 fresh limes and the rest in lime concentrate. I tasted the batter and added more lime juice till I got the flavor I wanted. 

I had my doubts at first as I had some leftover batter and put them in mini cupcake liners and baked it and the taste and texture was AWFUL! I was ready to throw it all out.

However I left the pie to rest in the fridge for a day and it was divine! My guests also really liked it.

Yum!!  Yum!!  Yum!!  Just like other reviewers I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of three cups. I did not juice my own limes. I opted for Nellie & Joes Key West Lime Juice. I omitted the lime zest except using it to decorate the pie. I don’t actually eat key lime pie but according to everyone who’s eaten it ... two thumbs up!  Great recipe!!

This was one of the simplest cheesecakes I have ever made. I was surprised by how perfect the consistency was. Because of the comments I decided to not put as much lime in but you could barely taste it so next time I will stick to the recipe. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that he sweetened condensed milk definitely gave a very defined taste that I didn’t completely love. Nevertheless we enjoyed it and I will probably be making it again before long.

This recipe won me first place in a pie baking contest! It was my first time ever making a pie and it turned out awesome! I only made two changes. I made my own graham cracker crust and I only used about 2.5 cups of sweetened condensed milk (because I only had two cans..). Other than that the recipe was perfect. So love!!

This is the best Key Lime Pie. No restaurant pie is even close to this recipe. It's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I use three cans condensed milk and the extra large deep gram-cracker crust. Everything else is the same. Bake it 10 mins and it sets perfectly.  This is one of my favorite desserts. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Making one tomorrow for a cookout!

I made this with the crust from Phoenician’s key lime recipe.  It was amazing!  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 13x9 glass baking dish.  The crust is pretty thick, so I may try 1.5 times the crust recipe next time. I used 4 cans of SCM, which is less than the recipe calls for, but it was still great.  I used bottled lime juice.  Once it cooled off, I covered it with a thin layer of whipping cream.  We had a little dessert bake off at work with about 20 different desserts, and this one won first place!

Delicious! Would not change a thing. Made my own crust which is the same crust on this site. Don’t forget the cinnamon in the crust. It makes a huge difference.

How can you beat four ingredients and five minutes in the oven?  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that I discovered it wasn't hard to make Key lime pie six years after my dad passed away - and it was his favorite.  I think of him every time I whip one up.

I love this! I made it for a pot luck at school and poured I into the mini graham cracker crusts. They wouldn’t let me take home the extras!
I did use lime and lemon juice as one person suggested, if short of key limes.

I love this pie!!!  I live  in New York, origionally from Florida and I miss the true Key Lime Pie.   I have  a hard time finding fresh Key Limes, But once I found them , squeezeing all those limes was worth it. I followed the receipe . I would not change a thing .

I also use a garlic press to squeeze the key limes. I also run the juice through a mesh strainer a couple of times. I’ve made this pie many times and it comes out perfect every time. I entered it in a pie contest against 38 other pies and it won Grand Champion!  You cannot go wrong with this pie.

My first time to make a Key Lime Pie and it was excellent!! I made a homemade graham cracker crust!! I also made homemade whipped cream! I used fresh key limes (about 24 key limes) and 2.5 cans of condensed milk! This will become part of my family recipe book!!

This is the best key lime pie recipe! To the person that said it was "tart" its supposed to be. Key limes are tart to begin with. :)

This pie was a home run!  It does take a lot of key limes to get 3/4 cup, but worth every tiny key lime!  The suggestion to use a garlic press to juice the key limes was brilliant!  Worked like a charm!  Thank you for the tip @Linda Sargent Meade!

I've made this a couple of times with my own graham cracker crust recipe. It's delicious and my vegetarian friends appreciate the absence of eggs. I cook it for 15 because I see no bubbles at 8 minutes. I see no bubbles at 15, but it comes out great.

This is our new favorite key lime pie recipe. It's tart but not overly so and it's even better with a thicker graham cracker crust! Cinnamon flavored graham crackers worked really well too. We make it all the time now for family events/holidays. It won first price at my office Pi Day competition too.

I love this recipe! I made it the first few times, completely following the recipe. The next couple times, for a more tart pie, I used only one can of sweetened condensed milk and upped the sour cream to 3/4 cup. I also always use the zest and juice of whatever limes I buy for the zest, and then use bought key lime juice for the rest. It turns out great!

Husband requested a Key Lime Pie and I selected this recipe because it was highly rated and simple. Wow! It’s amazingly good! The best Key Lime Pie we’ve ever had. I even used a pre-made pie crust and bottled lime juice... still delicious! One thing though: 5-8 minutes for bake time? No way. It was done after 15 minutes at 350°. 5 stars and husband approved!

I goofed! I read the instructions incorrectly and used 3 (14oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of 3 cups. It’s a testament to the quality of this recipe that, even after messing up the measurements, it still came out beyond decent (albeit sweeter than a proper key lime pie would normally be). I can’t wait to make this again with the correct ratios: it’s sure to be phenomenal! Thank you for sharing!

This is the one. As others have said, two cans of sweetened condensed milk make enough to fill the pie crust. I made this twice - once with a whole cup of lime juice, and the extra fruity acidity is delicious! The more rind you grate into the filling, the greener it becomes. I served this with homemade whipped cream.

Excellent recipe for key lime pie!! Have made the other one with the eggs and this one is much easier and better! I did cook it in the oven for 14 min. Just thought it might set up better. It was perfect! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

Delicious!  For those without access to Graham Crackers or pre made pie crusts, 3/4 pack of Gingernut biscuits and 70g melted butter with the addes lime zest works well for the base.  If you don't have access to key limes,  75% lime juice and 25% lemon juice is a great combo. Very easy to make and received lots of compliments.

An easy refreshing desert that everyone enjoyed. I already made it twice!  I used two real limes and then filled to 3/4 cup with bottled lime juice. Added green food coloring for Paty's Day.

I made this the other day and loved it. It tastes great and is pretty easy. The first time I add this I followed the directions and used a 9 inch crust but had some left over so I decided to try a 10 inch crust the next time and it held everything perfectly with no filling left over!

Made this last night for pi day along with a blackberry pie, and I'm glad I did.  I followed the recipe as closely as possible as it was my first attempt.  Used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, a store-bought graham cracker crust, and used the key lime juice found at the store.  Took 5 minutes to prepare, if that.   Baked in the oven 10 minutes before taking it out.  No bubbles, so I focused on the jiggle only.  After setting in the fridge overnight, I served it with whipped topping and it was a major hit.  One person even said it was the best key lime pie they've ever tasted.  It's so easy that you should at LEAST try it.

Substituted evaporated milk (unsweetened) and 1/3 c. sugar for the condensed milk. I used regular limes and a little lemon juice (when I got tired of squeezing limes), didn't bother with the zest, and it was still very tasty--and very easy except for squeezing the limes. The recipe seemed to make more filling than fit in the crust I had (9" graham cracker, as called for). I just ate the remainder like pudding...The pie didn't quite set but I assume that's because I mistakenly had the oven at 325 instead of 350 (I turned it up, but presumably too late).

Everyone loved this, although, I did notice the 3 cups of condensed milk was too much, I only needed the 2 cans. I used the fresh squeezed juice and everyone asked me for the recipe. Great pie (I also live in Florida, so its important to have a good key lime pie recipe.)

I did what most of the reviews said and used only 4 egg yokes, used two 14 ounce cans of sweetened condensed milk, one full cup of bottled key lime juice but I also used one whole regular lime, hand squeezed. I used some of the pulp and zest too. I also used one half cup sour cream. I got the large Keebler graham cracker pie crust and I did pre bake it about 5-6 minutes. Really good recipe.

I'm not sure how this recipe got such rave reviews. It tasted like candy. Wow! Way too sweet for me. I had a small slice and brought the rest of the pie to my office. Next time, I'll try the recipe that includes egg yolks.

Excellent. Texture was great, and everybody loved it. Could not get key lime juice, so I used some regular limes instead.

Only problem was it made way too much. I filled a store bought graham cracker crust, then had enough left over to fill an entire set of tart shells, and still have some left. Maybe the store bought shells are not 9".

The best KL Pie I've ever had. I'll never be able to buy one again. Got rave reviews from our dinner guests , we all thought it was outstanding.  Did have to cook it a lot longer than instructions, but no big deal. Make your own Graham cracker crust- its deserving of a home made one!

This is awesome. Better than some I have had at restaurants.  I made my own graham cracker crust and I used half a cup of presqueezed  lime juice and 1/4 cup fresh lime juice. My husband and family loved it.

Loved it!  Super easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.  Absolutely no key limes or key lime juice to be found so I used the regular lime/lemon substitute:  3/4 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice and 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.  Will absolutely make again!

When making with Mexican Lime juice, I added about 2 tablespoons less  juice, to keep it from being bitter. I also added 2 oz more sweetened condensed milk, as that’s what my two cans held, and the pie turned out amazing.

This is super easy so try it.  I used 1 14oz can of condensed and that was enough...also I experimented with limes from a friends lime tree ( California limes were bigger and much easier to squeeze).vs key limes.  They were plenty tart so was really happy with how this turned out.  So easy to make! Easy go to for homemade crowd pleaser.

This is the best key lime pie I've made.  I do take the time to squeeze key limes and I think it's worth it.  If I don't have enough, I use Nellie and Joe's key lime juice to finish it off.  I probably use more than a tablespoon of the lime zest too.  I'm really picky about key lime pies and this one definitely passes the test!

Delicious, rich and creamy, just the right combination of tart and sweet. Made my own crust. Needed about 18 key limes to get the right amount of juice for 1 pie.

This pie turned out perfectly! Everyone love it and I will make it again.

It was fairly easy to make, just be aware that key limes are small and it takes a lot of work to get 3/4 cup of juice!

I have made this recipe several times.  The only thing I do differently that is not in the recipe, is I bake it in a water bath so it cooks evenly.  Then once it's cooked leave it to cool in the open oven for 5 - 6 hours so it doesn't crack.

Perfect Key Lime Pie!  Used 2 cans condensed milk and 1/2 cup sour cream.  For lime juice I used ReaLime bottle.  I don't think this could be any easier.  FYI the expensive Key West lime juice is NOT made with KEY limes.  The cheap stuff worked perfect.

My first time making key lime pie and it worked terrifically! The flavor was a great balance between sweet with a definite tart citrus over it.  
It did need about 10 minutes in my oven to get the little bubbles mentioned-- it set up great & not brown at all.

This is a terrible recipe. It's not even close to authentic and those are Persian limes in the photo.  Here's the authentic recipe from my great-great grandmother's Florida Keys diner:
1 can sweetened condensed milk
4  egg yolks
1/2 cup KEY LIME juice, bottled or fresh
Scrape the milk out of the can into a bowl. Beat in the yolks then add the juice with beaters running.  Scrape into graham cracker crust.  Either bake for 15 mins at 350 and chill till serving time or refrigerate for 8 hours if you dont worry about eating raw eggs. No topping or meringue on an authentic pie.

Wow what a great and simple recipe.  Consistency was perfect.  I used 2 cans of condensed milk which should have been 28 oz but only came out to about 23 oz.  It was just right.  My family loved it.   I used about 15 key limes and the sweet/sour taste was perfect

I gave it 4 stars because the recipe filled a 10" store bought Graham crackers pie shell to the brim and I had to cook it for 20 and still wasn't seeing all the bubbles to make sure it was done.  Turned out pretty good after cooking it for 20 min vs the 5 to 8 min in the recipe.  If you want one normal sized pie, I recommend cutting the recipe in half...

I made this for work and everyone loved it. They called it the best Key Lime Pie they’d ever had. Everyone wanted the recipe. I had a slice left that I brought home for my family and they loved it too. My 10 year old son just helped me make one for Christmas dinner tomorrow because he said it was good enough to have year round. I would agree. I didn’t have real limes so no zest in my recipe. I used the bottle of key lime juice which I found I. The juice aisle. I mixed together a little sour cream, confectioners sugar and a drop of rum extract for the topping (because rum goes great with key lime pie!) This recipe is staying in he dessert rotation at my house. It was quick, easy and impressive.

This is my second time making this key lime pie and my family loves it! However, it takes me a lot more than 5-8 minutes to see tiny bubbles forming. More like 30. I just keep looking at it every five minutes until I see the bubbles and then take it out. So delish!

This pie is a huge hit and family favorite! The zest added makes all the difference. It can sometimes be a challenge to find keylimes but they can’t be substituted for anything else if you want that authentic key lime pie! I typically buy two bags of key limes for on each pie as I usually need about 3 extra keylimes to get the full 3/4 cup of key lime juice and the 1tbsp of zest. I do bake about twice as long and check every couple of minutes for the tiny pinhole bubbles to form.

Easy to make, easy to eat, great taste.  I only added more zest to the ingredients because I made too much during that step.  But it added even more flavor! =)

I hardly had any condensed milk and the crust was a terrible mess as this is my first time EVER making a pie. (I'm a 13 year old baker following my grandfather's dream of making pies) Thank you so much, delicious!

I've made this several times & one and all have loved it!  So, rather than  going through the thousands of reviews...has anyone frozen this pie?  I'm expecting out of town guests, but have to make it 3 or 4 days before they arrive (I'll be out of town myself until they arrive).

I made this recipe last week and it was a hit.  I was unsure of the 2 full cans of sweetened condensed milk but didn't know what I'd do with the leftover so I added both.
Very, very creamy, easy to make, but a little sweet.  Next time I will increase the lime just a bit to account for the sweetness.
I used 5 limes and the rinds from one.  Think I'll use 5.5-6 limes next time and taste as I go.  

I noticed many folks complaining about the difficulty of limes.  Here's a trick.

1.  Put 2-3 in the microwave for 10-15 seconds
2.  Take them out and roll them on counter and don't forget to roll them from top to bottom as well.
3.  Then, cut 4 heavy strips from the "core of the lemon/lime, and from each of those, squeeze.  
MUCH easier!

Delicious! Key lime is my favorite pie and this recipe was excellent. I did buy real key limes and squeezed the juice myself. A must, I believe, if you’re making a key lime pie.

My family loves this recipe, and we have passed it on to many friends! The only change we make is that we just use regular limes instead of key limes! Having made it both ways, using key limes just makes it too bitter for us.  Overall, super easy and tasty!

Made this for my Mom’s birthday, and it turned out delicious. I bought the bottled key lime juice, as others mentioned. I’ve juiced key limes before, and it’s a bit of a pain, so I was happy to read about a great alternative. I used a graham cracker crust recipe from this site (graham cracker crust II) as well. I had a little bit of crust and a little bit of pie filling left over, so I layered crust and filling in a couple of one cup bowls, and my son and I had a little key lime “pudding”...it was a delicious preview of the finished pie! No eggs in the recipe so it’s safe to eat before baking! Will definitely make it again. My sister took one bite and said, “wow! This is REALLY good!” I said, “well of course it is! I made it!” ??

Who knew you DIDN'T need eggs to make key lime pie??!!  But it's true.  This is my favorite out of 3 other key lime pie recipes I tried from this site.  I used 2 (14 oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk and it was the perfect amount. 
 Also, 3/4 cup Nellie & Joe's bottled key lime juice gave it the perfect amount of lime flavor.  I put my oven light on and saw the little pin-hole bubbles after 8 minutes. Don't mess with this recipe.  It comes out great if you follow it just as is.   I made my own crust with 1 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs plus a little over 1/2 cup of vegan butter spread and baked at 350 for 8 minutes (could've been a little longer for more crunch).  This pie won't last one day in my house.  Everyone loves it!

Delicious.  I’m not sure where the couple of reviews are getting that 2 cans of condensed milk are 3 cups (750ml) but the eaglebrand condensed milk I bought was 300ml per container so 2 and a bit containers were needed to reach the 750ml.  I also tossed on some whip cream and toasted coconut to make it perfect.

I absolutely love this recipe exactly as is!! I made this pie for my Dad, and his eyes lit up! He hadn’t had key lime pie in years, and it was always his favorite, and said it was the best key lime pie he’s ever had. Thank you for this recipe, and making a 72 year old extremely happy!!!

This was pretty yummy!!!  I found that the recipe took about 2.5 cans of condensed milk.  I made a homemade graham cracker crust and topped it with some dollops of fresh whipped cream and key lime slices.

Since I didn't have key lime I used 2 regular limes and 1 large lemon which came out to exactly 3/4.  (I had read that equal parts of regular limes and lemons can be substituted for key limes). Two can of the sweetened condensed milk makes it sweet enough. It came out so delicious and full of flavor. The tiny bubbles never formed so I took it out after 10 minutes and it was perfect. I like this recipe because I do not like the taste of the eggs in the other recipes. I will make this again as it was so easy to make and was a hit with my dinner guests!

Delish! We  prefer a key lime pie to be more on the tart side than the sweet side so we used 2 cups of sweetened condensed milk instead of 3 cups and found it to be a perfect balance of tart and sweet. We also used the Graham Cracker Crust by Carol on this site and it was a perfect combination. Great recipe!

Amazing flavor ! This is the first keylime pie I have made and I was a little Leary on what it was going to taste like  . I followed the  recipe exactly as stated and used various limes I had on hand . Made crust from some left over graham cracker crumbs I had . Surprisingly easy ! Will be making again .

Delicious pie.  I made my own graham cracker crust and did not change the recipe at all.  Our new favorite key lime pie recipe, and so simple to make.

My 6 year old is addicted to Tillamook (key?) lime yogurt. The other night, we watched a “pie” episode on some food show. When he discovered that a KEY LIME PIE existed, he demanded on making one. So, the next day, he made this super easy recipe, and it turned out awesome. The only thing I helped him with was incorporating all of that sticky condensed milk! Anyway, it was a little too sweet, even for a sugar-head like him. The 2nd night, we topped it with an unsweetened whipped cream, and it was much easier to devour. He will definitely make this again, at his grandma and uncle’s stern request!

So good, and so easy! I made it for my husband, his parents, and my 4-year old daughter—it was a hit with everyone! I figured something was probably missing from the recipe, and the consistency couldn’t turn out that well given the ingredient list...but nope! It was perfect!

How is this so easy?! I just doubled this recipe to make 2 pies (one for home and one for a dinner party). I juiced sooo many keylime and did not have quite enough so I ended up using half keylime and have regular lime juice. Results were wonderful! We just tested a slice of the (at home) pie and it set beautifully and had a great flavor. I'll be proud to take this to our dinner party tomorow!

This was delicious - my whole extended family loved it. I'll make it again, but with a slight change. Next time I'll use 1/3C sour cream instead of 1/2C. That way I think you get just a bit more of the tartness of the lime and a bit less of the sour cream, plus it would make it just a tad less custard-like.

This pie was AWESOME and super quick to make!  Given that limes in the Seattle area cost $1.00 ea and I couldn't afford to spend $20 on 20 limes, I did substitute using Nellie & Joe's Key Lime juice and added the zest from one lime.  I also made my own graham cracker crust which I baked for 10min and then cooled before adding the pie filling.  My oven is old, so I baked the pie for approx 12min - the "bubbles" looked like pin pricks, but when they surfaced is when I removed the pie from the oven - it was set perfect!  I let it cool and refrigerated it for about 2 hours during our family dinner... it sliced up beautifully and everyone LOVED it!  Thank you for the recipe!

Super easy and quick dessert that will make your guests think you worked very hard in the kitchen! I just used about 1 cup of lime juice to get a delicious punch of lime.  A crowd pleasure for sure.

Amazing, but pay attention to ingredient list.  Recipe calls for Key Lime Juice... not lime.  Substitute half lemon and half lime for Key Lime Juice.

This was so easy and tastes amazing. I used 2, 14oz cans of  sweetened condensed milk and of course had left over pie filling.  I then added heavy cream to the left over pie filling and whipped it into whip cream. So I had a lime zing in the whipped cream.  If your  trying to decide wether or not to make this.  Make it!

I made this for my son last night  and chilled it in the fridge over night. We tried it this morning and it was out of this world AMAZING! ****Just a heads up to anyone making it.**** It takes (roughly) about 35-40 key limes to make so make sure you have enough. I also used a garlic press to squeeze the limes and cut those in fours so they would fit. If you don’t own one already, BUY ONE because it helps big time! I also topped this with Cool Whip and sliced key limes. This was my first time making a key lime pie and I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I didn't do the whipped cream, but it was so easy and delicious nonetheless. The closest grocery stores didn't have any key limes in stock, so I bought a bottle of Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice, and used a regular lime for the zest. I'll definitely be making this again.

Apologies if this is a repeat review but my computer just blipped. It’s rare that I try a new recipe that we truly Do Not like. I made this exactly as the recipe stated right down to squeezing the fresh (and expensive) key limes. The pie was way too tart....more like too bitter.  I chose the recipe because of the high number of 5 star reviews so I’d like feedback as to why we just couldn’t even enjoy..or finish ...this pie.  It definitely was not enjoyable but I know I followed the recipe correctly. 
I’m thinking it was the limes????

First attempt at Key lime pie. I was a little scared when I started but it turned out really good. I used regular limes and thought it was a little to much. Will try with "key limes" next time.

No changes needed! Sinfully easy, sinfully good!
Compared to other lime pie recipes, the sour cream and extra unsweetened condensed milk  gives this a richer  texture. The lime zest gives it a nice zing! This recipe also FILLS the pie dish!

I have made this three times now and each time is it a huge hit! I did use Persian limes instead due to availability and I believe each time I needed under 15.  I made the graham cracker with graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and softened butter. I had found that recipe on Allrecipes as well.  I top it with home made whipped cream.  This will definitely continue to be a favorite.

This was SO easy, and SO good - definitely 8 minutes not 5 in the oven. It was too much filling for the crust though! Next time I'll reduce by 2/3.

So is it 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk OR 2 cans?  The cans are 14 ounces each.  I'm confused.  I used 2 1/2 cans to be safe.

Love this recipe, it's everyone's favorite key lime pie. So easy and so good. I don't even use key limes, regular limes are still delicious! Use a little extra zest for more limey flavor.

Best key lime pie recipe I've ever used.  My family raves about it.  I do not bake the graham cracker crust.

Excellent!  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and made cupcake size pies, using parchment paper cupcake liners.  I put 1 Tablespoon of graham cracker crust in each one and patted it down, then baked it until golden brown.  I cooled them slightly then added the key lime pie mixture and baked it at 325 degrees in my convection oven for 7 minutes.  They turned out perfect!

I'm not a huge key lime fan, but my family is....and they RAVED about this pie!  It was one of the easiest pies I've ever made.  The key lime zest really puts it over the top.   Highly recommend.

Easy and Delicious! I followed recipe exactly as written, (I used Nellie and Joe's Key West Key Lime Juice) though I chose not to put lime zest in the filling as I don't really care for the look or green strings in it. Pretty enough atop if desired. I top mine with a layer of freshly whipped cream. (a pint whipped with a little sugar and vanilla does 2 topping layers) It is very sweet as expected so slim I feel it goes far due to slim slices being enough. It cuts beautifully. I would like to find a key lime recipe that doesn't rely upon sweetened condensed milk but there is no guarantee I'd like it better.

Best key lime pie I've ever had!!! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I didn't have key limes so I used regular limes (gasp!!). I was nervous about this, but I read that Ree Drummond has used regular lime juice in a key lime pie before so I figured it couldn't be all that bad. Well, it was fabulous... I couldn't tell the difference at all and my husband RAVED about it!!! And bonus,  regular limes don't take as long to squeeze since they're larger. I think I used 8 limes. Be sure to add the zest, it really adds that extra little zing! Planning to make this again in a couple of weeks for the 4th!!

Very easy to make and super delicious!  The only tedious part was zesting and squeezing the limes for the fesh juice because they are so tiny. These two  steps take time but are well worth the results! The pie came out nice and rich with a tart key lime flavor. I topped each slice off with cool whip and my family loved it.

My whole family absolutely loved this, but I personally found it a bit overwhelming in sweetness. I have to admit that sweet items don't usually called me. I have recommended this to a few friends and they loved it as well. I really loved the simplicity of it and how easy it was to make.

Big hit with the husband and in laws! I used a tart pan which worked well because filling may not have filled a pie pan. Fresh whipped cream topping and decorated as in photo. Beautiful and Yummy!

I’ve made this several times. It’s my go to summer dessert recipe.  We have family members that are gluten sensitive so I make the crust out of crushed Rice Chex.  I follow the graham cracker crust directions with the crushed Rice Chex, it’s delicious.

Nice and tart.  I cheated with a store bought crust, ooh don't tell anyone.  Didn't have time for a homemade crust which would have made this review a six.  Our zest was nice and small.  This made the addition of the lime almost unnoticeable.  We had a $22 key lime pie down in the keys December of 2017 and this was just as good.  Made my own whipped topping using heavy whipping cream.  Took all but a couple minutes to make and add.  We took it to a Memorial Day cookout and other Key Lime Pie aficionados loved it as well.  Great recipe.

Great recipe.  I made it for Memorial Day and everyone raved about it.  Will use again.  I didn’t have access to any Key Limes or Key Lime Juice here in California so I substituted with Mexican lime.  Turned out yummy.  I used 2 cans of 14oz sweetened condensed milk.  Blended all ingredients in a food process which made it so quick and easy.  I baked both pies together for about 10 mins at 350.  I will definitely make this again.

Followed the directions exactly, except cooked it about 5 minute longer than specified. I used low fat sour cream. The next time I’ll try using 1 can of unsweetened and 1 of sweetened. Two cans are just the right amount. This recipe got rave reviews from everybody that tasted it. Great recipe and it couldn’t have been any easier to make!

Wouldn't change a thing! Rave reviews when I make this pie. 
I need to add that it comes out the best when I use Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk. Tried other brands and pie was too sweet.

Let’s be honest, this is super super easy to make.  If you want to be lazy, buy the key lime juice in a bottle.  Same measurements as above.  That being said..

This pie has amazing flavor and texture, and isn't too hard to make.  I used Persian limes, and it turned out fantastic.  Also, I have made this a few times and 10 minutes in the oven worked for me.  The pie received rave reviews from most testers - it was the person who preferred an egg version of key lime pie who didn't rave over it (she liked it, but preferred a version made with egg).  This is a KEEPER, for sure!

The flavors didn't seem to meld together.  Baked for 15 minutes but still no bubbles.  Not sure if I should have baked longer.

Turned out fantastic even with the clumsy measurement for the Condensed Milk.  I would have given it 5 stars but with the major error in how to measure the Condensed Milk, I could not over look such a major blunder and why the author does not address this is beyond me.  Stick with the 2 cans and forget the 3 cups and all will be fine.  I also used a 10 inch graham cracker crust and it filled it .

So tasty!  We used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and “Nellie and Joe’s The Original Famous Key West Lime Juice”.  We made our own graham cracker crust.  Really simple and quick, yet tasted awesome!

This pie was awesome. I had started out looking for a key lime pie recipe and mistakenly prepped the 4 egg yolks called for in another recipe so I included those.  I used 2 14-oz cans, plus 1 7-oz can of sweetened condensed milk to equal 3 cups.  I mixed the SCM with the egg yolks, then tempered in 3/4 C lime juice and added the lime zest.  It took about 10 key limes to get the zest needed. Unfortunately, I had a spill during the process so added some bottled key lime juice to make up for that loss.  I put the ingredients in a Keebler graham cracker crust that said it makes 2 extra servings - it fit well, about 1/4" from the top of the crust. I cooked it for 15 minutes and chilled the pie as indicated . . . it was really good.  I didn't put on the whipping cream yet, but I may when I serve it to guests tomorrow.  That part can be their choice.

Made this recipe two ways - one using fresh squeezed key limes for juice and the other using bottled key lime juice.  The obvious difference (picture of pies side-by-side) is that Pie 1 made with fresh key limes is lighter in color,  where Pie 2 made with bottled juice looks darker. Pie 1 was more tart and had a better flavor. Pie 2 was not bad and, without the comparison, probably would not be able to tell the difference.  Followed the recipe exactly but baked almost 14 minutes and still no bubbles. Both options taste good, so it just depends on if you want to take the time to squeeze all those tiny key limes. I will probably squeeze them again when I make the next one!

This recipe is soooooo simple and a serious crowd pleaser! I made a "practice" pie for my co-workers and they all said it was one of or the best key lime they have had. Making your own graham cracker crust definitely kicks it up a notch.  I also made this pie for my boyfriend for his birthday, he absolutely loves key lime pie, and RAVED about this one! Highly recommend and no adjustments were needed.
I was able to buy specific key lime juice and that definitely help it be very, very easy and still tons of flavor!

First time making a key lime pie and it was wonderful! Used the garlic press to squeeze the limes. It was not tart. For those that said it was too tart, wondering about the ripeness of the limes or juice to milk ratio. 2 cans of condensed milk was perfect. I also made homemade whipped cream and candied key lime slices. I used store bought graham cracker crust but brushed it with melted butter for a more homemade taste. Very refreshing.

I made this for a date who had told me prior that key lime was his favorite. I was a little nervous but after reading the reviews, I took a leap of faith...so glad I did! I used a about a cup of key lime juice (for me 3/4 cup didn’t really give it the lime taste I wanted & the condensed milk over powered it) I hand squeezed them using a lime squeezer I found at Walmart. It went pretty fast. I baked it for 10 mins after reading the other reviews, let it cool on the counter a bit and then refrigerated for 4 hours before serving. It was a hit & he couldn’t stop raving about it. I used a flour sifter to strain the freshly squeezed juice to make sure there were no hidden seeds, etc. The fresh key lime zest made it even better! The pic is when it was still warm but before serving I garnished with whip cream & key lime twists. Love this!

Excellent! Very simple and tasty! My boyfriend LOVES key lime pie, and he approves! Next time I may add a bit more key lime juice or some fresh basic lime juice to add a bit more bite for him. :-)

Delicious!  Perfect level of tart and sweet. I used half pint wide mouth mason jars for this and sold at a charity bake sale!  I even made little labels for the jars. It made 11 containers when I doubled the recipe.   I did wear latex gloves while squeezing the lines and found that cutting each half slightly helped in the juicing process!

Tastes great! Fast and easy to make. Mine didn't have bubbles so I baked it a bit longer, but still none, I guess it doesn't always do that.

I added shredded coconut to it as well. The one in the photo is a test one with a premade crust. When I make a second one I'll be using a Graham cracker crust with coconut oil subbed for the butter.

Oh also a note: this recipe makes more filling than will fit in a crust, so you'll be able to make 1.5-2 pies.

I made this as written. Overall it's a real good pie recipe. My family liked the taste but found it just a  little too sweet. I'll make this again but reduce the condensed milk to 3/4 can and substitute sour cream for the remaining 1/4. Cool whip is a must, it helps reduce the richness. I suggest spreading some across the entire top.

I baked this for Pi Day at work. There were 8 slices, & no less than 6 people commented on how good the key lime pie was! One told me it was one of the best pies he’d ever tasted.

This was the first key lime pie I’ve ever made, and it will be the only key lime pie recipe I’ll ever use. Perfection! I scaled all the ingredients down so I could use 2 (10-tablespoon) cans of sweetened condensed milk, which comes to 2-1/2 cups of milk instead of the called-for 3 cups, and the filling was just the right amount for a 9-inch pie.

Excellent! I've made this so many times. 3 cans of  sweetened condensed milk = 3 1/3 cups. I hated having that 1/3 cup left over. So I add 2 extra Tbsp of lime juice and 1 extra Tbsp of sour cream. This will perfectly fill one 10 inch pie shell OR one 9 inch shell plus six mini pie shells (the individual ones). FANTASTIC!

This was my first attempt at making a key lime pie from scratch and it was very good! The pie was dense and just the right amount of tart, although I think I may sweeten it up just a little the next time I make it. Squeezing all of those little limes was a chore (took about 20), so the reviewer who suggested using a garlic press is a genius!

Perfection. The right balance of sweet and tart with the luscious creamy texture. I used a little less than 2-14oz cans of sweetened condensed milk and baked for ten minutes. Everyone loved it.

This is an easy and flexible recipe that my family loves.  I have used key lime juice and substituted regular lime when unable to find key limes here in Texas.  I have used home made crust and ready made crust.  Thank you for sharing.

I made it with a basic graham cracker crust. I prepared the pie for an event that I wasn't actually attending. My friends that were there though were literally texting me pictures of them eating it and talking about how it was so amazing, people were practically fighting to get a piece of it. Another friend said it's the best pie he's ever had. You think I'm joking because this sounds so over-the-top, but I kid you not! haha People went bananas over this pie.

Best ever! I will make again!

Small changes: I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of measuring out 3 cups.
I also upped the key lime to 1 cup to balance out the extra milk. Turned out great!!!

I have eaten key lime pie all throughout the Florida Keys. I have even had some shipped home on dry ice. No need anymore. This is one of if not the best key lime pie I have ever had. Go ahead and make it, you won’t be sorry!

I’ve tried 3-4 different recipes and this one is always the favorite and it’s so simple. To really knock it out of the park, brown some butter and make your own graham cracker crust with that. Top it off with homemade whip cream and watch the your guests attack the pie like a pack of ravenous wolves.

I thought this was super easy and very good. My husband is a key lime critic and said it was smooth, not to tart or to sweet. Overall, great pie! Thank you for the recipe. One thing...mine didn't have pin size bubbles so I cooked it a couple minutes longer and it turned out perfect.

This is without a doubt the best Key Lime Pie ever. I made it exactly as written with the exception that I used Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice instead of squeezing all those small key limes. I took it to a New Year's Eve, King crab legs celebration dinner and it was a huge hit. Great, easy pie to top off a seafood dinner. Think replacing egg yolks with sour cream Will definitely be a keeper.

Found an article on Google to microwave the key limes for about 30 seconds to make them easier to squeeze.  I did it for about 50 seconds.  Worked great and used a fork to squeeze easier. Also, I baked it longer than the instructions.  Never got the bubbles,  but felt it was time.  It was great,  boyfriend and I love it.

This was a hit at a recent dinner with friends.  A few notes from my experience - Two 14 oz. cans of condensed milk do not yield 3 measured cups....probably has something to do with how the ounces are measured (weight, mass...clearly I missed this in science class).  Because of this, the filling was slightly low in the crust.  However,it was not a big deal.  I used just the two cans and the filling was delicious.  I also made homemade whipped ream. Great pie!

My husband is very picky with key lime pie and he loved this recipe. It was deliciousness; the sour cream balances out the tartness of the key lime juice.

Ahh-Mazing!!! Just like others, I received rave reviews with this recipe. I made my own crust, here’s the recipe for wonderful homemade graham cracker crust... 1 ¼ cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup pecans finely chopped, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup melted butter. Cook crust for 8 minutes and let it cool while juicing the limes. I used just a tad less than 3/4 cups lime juice. The other thing I did was I left the pie in the oven after cooking with door slightly open for 30 minutes as another reviewer had suggested prior to putting in the refrigerator. I even used a spring foam pan and it held together wonderfully!!

I got 3/4 C lime juice from about 10 limes just using fingers inside limes.  I couldn't quite get 3C sweetened condensed milk from 2 cans but a little extra sour cream worked fine. Then my oven wasn't
warm enough, and the pie set up beautifully. Great recipe!!!

Excellent recipe!  I used limes not key limes and it was still delicious!  Not too sweet, not too tart, just perfect!  Simple as pie!!!!  I also baked for 11 minutes and it was great.  I agree bubbles are hard to detect but if your oven is calibrated accurately, 11 minutes will be fine.  I served this after Christmas Dinner (yes - in the middle of winter) but because we were all so stuffed, it was a light delight!  I highly recommend this recipe!

It's 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk (each is 1.5 cups) which comes out to the 3 cups needed for the recipe. Everything else is spot on. Good luck.

I was worried that all the condensed milk would make this too sweet, but the sour cream cut that issue down to size. This is a great pie. The only change I made to this was using a pastry crust as I didn't have enough Graham cracker crumbs to make the crust. This is definitely a keeper.

Two cans of milk are 28 ounces but only 2 & 1/2 cups liquid. If you want to be exact you need 3 cans. I just used the two & it worked

I have made this pie probably 15 times already.  There is no need to change anything.  It's super simple and delicious.  A note to people baking this pie for the first time;  I have never gotten this pie to "bubble", so don't sweat it if yours doesn't bubble either.   It comes out perfect every time regardless.   Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I made this pie and it  turned out excellent!  It has the right amount of lime flavor.  I used two cans of condensed milk as suggested by others.  I also put my limes in the microwave for 30 seconds and rolled them on the counter back and forth to get the juices flowing.  I used a lemon juicer and was able to get all the juice I needed with a lot  fewer limes.  I baked the pie for 10 minutes but never saw the tiny pin holes. This recipe is perfect as written.

This ranks a 10 out of 10!!!!  Use 2 14-oz. cans sweetened condensed milk. (Measures appx. 2.5 cups, but this amt works well and doesn't overfill the pie crust.)  1 lime gives about 1 T. of needed zest. Buy an extra lime if you want to slice thinly and/or zest for decor on top. (Tip: Use a good garlic press to juice keylimes.) Place prepped pie with filling on large pan and bake 10-11 minutes, watching so it doesn't brown. Cool thoroughly (in fridge) then "frost" with homemade whipped cream (half pint w/ vanilla and powdered sugar). Store in fridge until served.

I love baking but it always makes me a little nervous to try something new. But I had nothing to worry about. This recipe was super easy and my family absolutely loved it!! I purchased a bottle of key lime juice instead of trying to find limes or squeeze them. I made the graham cracker crust from scratch. Personally, I think they are better than any store bought crust. Give this a shot. You won’t be disappointed!

I made it exactly as the recipe described. I measured the sweetened condensed milk, and 3 cups was way too much; you can barely taste the lime. Just two 14-oz. cans would have been plenty. 
I cooked 10 minutes and tiny bubbles never appeared on the surface. I think it  was because of the huge amount of sweetened condensed milk. Remember, the number of ounces on the can is by weight and when you count cups it is fluid ounces.

SO easy to make and refreshingly delicious. I actually only used 1.5 cups of condensed milk (half the amount stated in the recipe) and it was sweet enough.

Wow just Wow!! I have used other Key Lime Pie recipes and I can say this is by far the very best!  I made it for July 4th and my family absolutely loved it.  My oldest daughter asked me "Mom will you make this for my birthday"  Today is her birthday and yes I did make it for her.  Thank you so much!!

Easy and delicious! I used regular limes because my local store did not have key limes. I did make my own graham cracker crust. I have made other key lime pies before with eggs. This was so easy and fabulous! Thank you for sharing it with us! I did garnish with whipped cream and lime slices. I will definitely make it again and use it as my go-to key lime pie recipe!

I made this at the request of my daughter for her 21st birthday. Never made it before and it has been years since I have had key lime. Easy peasy, no issues making it. Everyone loved it, one person thought it was a little too sweet but everyone else raved over it! I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely delicious, every single person went for a second piece and had tons of compliments!  Very creamy not too much key lime and I put cool whip on top.  Came out perfect.

I couldn't believe how easy it was to make this pie, not to mention how delish it is.  The hard part was juicing and zesting the small limes but the result is worth the work.  Thanks for sharing this simple recipe.

Did I make it!!!?!  OMG yes!  This pie is so good.  If I could I would give it 10 stars!  I made 5 of these to take to work.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I will definitely be making this time and time again.  The only think I did was to use only two cans of condensed milk as other reviews had suggested.  Turned out GREAT!

Works wonderfully well with a gluten free pie crust.   I've also made it subbing lemon juice and zest.  Prefer the lime. It lemon is good for a change.

I made it exactly like the recipe said, and it came out fabulously! I made this pie for my dad's birthday. It has a very fresh lime flavor without being too bitter or overwhelming. The little flecks of lime zest are lovely to look at too.

I wanted this the be great after reading all the reviews. This was my first crack at making key lime pie. Sadly, I should've tried the traditional version with eggs as me and my family found this one cloyingly sweet! It was for my sister's birthday as she loves key lime pie and she barely finished a slice. Very disappointed. Note: It took about 30 key limes for me and I did warm them in the microwave before hand squeezing them.

Super easy, super delicious - my fave kind of recipe!
Followed the advice of others and used 2 (300ml) cans of sweetened condensed milk. Didn't have key limes so I used 3 regular limes - which made exactly 3/4-cup of lime juice, and 2 rinds for zest made 1-tbsp. Made my own graham cracker crust (1-1/4 cup graham crumbs & 1/3-cup melted butter, pressed into a 12" pie pan). I baked in convection at 325 and had no idea how to tell if it was done... I left it in for 12-minutes which worked out perfect. Chilled in the fridge for an hour. Delicious!!

Great recipe with the sour cream.  However there are no eggs in this recipe. Why do you need to bake it? You can just mix the filling, pour it into the crust, top with whipped cream and chill in the fridge overnight. Or you could use a little gelatin to set the filling a little more. Also, try using a dash of ground coriander in the filling. Coriander and lime are a classic flavor combination and you'll be pleasantly surprised how well it works in Key Lime Pie. You could also put some finely minced cilantro in the whipped cream topping instead of coriander in the filling. It's a nice green garnish and tastes awesome with lime!

It was delicious and so easy to make.  I juiced a bag of key limes and also purchased a bottle of key lime juice.  Next time I will use the juice from the bottle and fresh key limes for grating the rind and serving.  Scrumptious!!!

Perfect recipe! Was delicious and sooo easy. Will be my go to - with a simple whipped cream it's impressive and easy. I accidentally baked for 17 minutes, still no bubbles but wasn't brown or overdone at all.  Everyone loved it

This is the best key lime pie recipe! I have a small catering business where I cater to vegan, gluten free and paleo diets. I've made this gluten free and vegan! I've also made for the everyone else crowd as well :) I changed a few things, I used gluten free and vegan ingredients and I always throw in half a teaspoon of extra zest. Finally, I usually serve it slightly thawed with whipped cream or coconut based whipped cream. Did I mention I love this recipe! Thanks for posting it!!!

Very easy; no bubbling when baking so let it bake for 12 min at 350. Great idea to use garlic press to juice key limes. Slice them in half and it takes no time to juice 20-30.  Made my own whipped topping from heavy whipped cream.

I made the pie the night before we ate it, following directions, except I used light sour cream and condensed milk.  It. The pie had a slightly gritty texture.  Only one person in a group of 4 finished their piece (my loyal husband).  I'll probably make it again, but use full fat products and let it set even longer than  24  hours.

I made this recipe exactly as suggested, making my own graham cracker crust.  As others pointed out 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk was perfect.  I used bottled Key Lime juice (Nellie & Joe's of Key West) and it was delicious.  My husband said it was better than any we've had in the Keys (we live in Miami).  I think the juice is key to a perfect pie as some others complained of too much tartness, this was not at all a problem and I did use the zest of one lime.  I added home made whipped cream and spread it over all.  I love how easy this pie is and how delicious.

Amazing!! Seriously, best key lime pie ever! I made it and everybody loved it so much I had to make it again a few days later. I've never liked key lime pie and even I couldn't get enough. And I love how easy and foolproof the recipe is. I use the popular graham cracker crust recipe from this site and its delicious. (FYI, if you don't want to measure out the condensed milk...each 14oz can is just a little over a cup. So if you just pour almost all of 3 cans straight into the bowl and don't scrape it down, it should be about 3 cups. There should be just a little left in each can)

This was my first-ever key lime pie! It turned out really nicely! I used prepackaged lime juice, not actual juice from key limes as I didn't feel like squeezing 30+ little limes. I also added a little bit of fresh lime juice and 1-2 tablespoons of lime jello to amp up the flavor. It was very good, and I will definitely make it again.

I added about a quarter cup of sour cream, used bottled Lime juice, juice from a half of regular sized lime, omitted the lime rind, and......it was fantastic. Perfect balance between sweet and tart. I had people and relatives offer to pay me $ to make them one! I also did 1.5X the graham cracker crust so it was a little thicker. Perfect. I placed a couple of lime rinds in the center and garnished with small organic strawberries around that. I was so pretty AND unbelievably good!

This was THE Key Lime Pie recipe that I was looking for! I used regular limes, and it was absolutely divine! I noticed some of you used key limes and were disappointed with the taste. I used them a long time ago for a pie. It tasted like rust! Also had a bitterness to it. The regular limes are the way to go here. I used 8 to get exactly the amount I needed. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly. Only change was I made my own graham cracker crust by using one package of honey graham crackers and 6 T butter. The pie was amazing!! My family has already asked for another one.

My husband said it was the best key lime pie I've ever made.  So easy to mix up.  I kept the pie in the oven for 10 minutes and after it cooled on the counter it went into the fridge.  Set up perfectly.

I made this recipe this weekend for my family and everyone raved about it.  My mom said it was the best key lime pie she'd ever had and she's been to Key West!  The recipe was extremely easy to follow along; I took the advice of other reviewers and made homemade graham cracker crust...not a drop left over!

Hands down the best key lime pie I've ever had. I followed the recipe except I had regular limes in the fridge I needed to use up before they went bad. 

If using regular limes, if they are on the small side, you will need 6-7 limes. I used twice the lime peel because I like it.  This recipe is a keeper. next time I'm going to double it and make it in a cake pan for bars. 

Also, after it has cooled, I topped with whip cream dollops and more grated lime peel. Yummy and pretty.

While this is a simple recipe to follow, most people do not realise/know that the original Key Limes are from the Florida Keys.  They do have a different texture and taste from the commonly used Persian Lime and I gave it a low score as it calls for Key Lime juice but not Key Lime zest, and because other recipes are so much the same.

I love this pie it was easy and tasty and my family loved it! I do not like key lime pie but this was wonderful. The crust is really good so if you have time to make it then make the graham cracker  crust.  This pie did take some time to make but at the end it was worth it! My family loved it and wants me to make it again!

I've made this countless times and will keep making it cuz it's AMAZING!! I do add a bit more grated lime zest and juice just because I like mine a little more tart. Great easy recipe.

Ive been making this for a couple years, it's amazing. Everyone always asks me for the recipe. I use homemade graham cracker crust and serve with a homemade raspberry drizzle. Perfect pairing.

So easy and yummy! The only things I changed was making them into mini pies in muffin cups (I used Carol's recipe "Graham Cracker Crust I" which turned out perfectly) and using limes instead of key limes. Neither gave me any problems. It turned out wonderfully and looked fancy without having to put in a huge amount of effort. 
When I was serving these at a party, I decided to make them prettier by I adding two drops green dye to the filling and making a mixture of half zest half sugar to sprinkle on top of homemade whip cream (cream, powdered sugar, and light corn syrup.)

That was the worst tasting pie ever.  I questioned making it when I saw that it was basically sweetened condensed milk in a pie shell.  We couldn't even eat it - we literally spit out what was in our mouths and threw the entire pie away.

Turned out very well.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  There's a little twang at the end of every bite which is nice.

Every time  I have made this pie, I get rave reviews about it, and there isn't a single piece left!  It is very refreshing, and now I usually make 2 pies because 1 just isn't enough!  Also, if I am short on time, I just buy enough limes to get enough grated lime zest needed, then if I need more lime juice, I substitute with  a quality bottled lime juice-- I can't tell the difference!

This was my first time making Key Lime Pie, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The recipe was super easy, and the results were mouth-watering. I brushed the ready made crust with egg and baked before filling, and I didn't use lime zest. The crust had just enough crunch to compliment the soft filling, 
and the ratio of sweet to tart was perfect. This is a keeper!!

First of all, I followed the recipe and directions to the letter.  This was extremely easy to make.  That portion deserves 5 stars.  But this pie is very limey.  It is almost inedible, and I eat lemons with a little salt for a snack.  I don't know what I could have done to make this pie less tart.  So as far as taste goes, this pie only gets 3 stars.  With lots of whipped cream it is possible to eat.

Loved this recipe and the people I served it to rated it an eight out of ten. Really refreshing recipe for the summer. Do be warned because this pie is strong and kids don't typically like it. Amazing recipe though, I've made it 4 times now and plan to again soon.

This recipe is fabulous - a homerun!  So simple and quick to make yet absolutely delicious with a light, creamy texture.  I used persian limes since I didn't have any keylimes.

Even though squeezing and zesting the limes seemed tedious, it was well worth it. I can't believe it's such a simple recipe! My husband said it may be his new favorite pie and my 7 year old loves it. I will definitely be making this many more times!

I couldn't find key limes so I used regular limes it made it a bit more tart but still delicious.  I didn't really care for the lime rind.  I ground it up in the food processor but I just didn't enjoy the texture of it.  I would leave that out next time.  I paired this with Graham cracker crust I recipe.

This is a really good, really easy recipe. I only had 2 1/2 cups of condensed milk, so I added an extra 1/4 cup of sour cream. I like key lime pie a little on the tart side, so I doubled the lime zest and added an extra tablespoon of lime juice, so I had to increase the baking time because of the extra liquid. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a potluck and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the lime zest. In the interest of time and the nature of the event, I chose to use pre made graham cracker tart shells (I think they were Keebler brand).  I doubled the recipe and this filled 24 shells exactly.  I used the juice of about 45 key limes and 5 cans of condensed milk.  I topped with homemade whipped cream when I served them.  This recipe is good, quick and easy. I think other similar flavors could be substituted for the lime.

First time ever making a key lime pie and it was perfect.  It took about 6 regular size limes to make up the 3/4 cup key lime juice.  It never did really bubble on top so I just took it out after 11 minutes.   I'm a novice baker so I was thrilled that it was so delicious!!

I made this pie first time on a whim, and I generally have mixed success with baking. It was incredibly easy and fast to make, and came out perfectly. It is now my go-to recipe for every summer potluck, and it gets rave reviews every time. It definitely makes me look like a better baker than I am. (To make it even easier, I just use bottled lime juice, and then grate a single lime to add to the batter.) This pie is fantastic.

Made this a week ago, to the letter, and it was awesome. Could it be more awesome? Well, try it , and then tell me. All the same ingredients except for one. I subbed one of the cans of the condensed milk for a can of condensed COCONUT milk. WONDERFUL!! Filling even came out fluffier with the coconut milk. GREAT!!!

Substituted plain Greek yogurt for sour cream. Could not taste the difference, and made it a bit healthier. Skipped the zest.  Amazing pie. I suggest tasting as you go, there's no raw egg - so taste away, make it to your preferred taste - If it's not limey enough for your taste, add more lime.  Not sweet enough, add more sweetened condensed milk. You can't go wrong. Everytime I make it for a special occasion someone asks for the recipe. So easy, and tastes SO GOOD! Perfect texture and taste.

This is an easy but delicious recipe! When out of sour cream I substituted Steggis Icelandic yogurt, used coconut flavor but plain would likely work as well, and could not tell a difference!

This pie was incredible and so easy to make!  I used store bought key lime juice and made my own macadamia nut graham cracker crust which took it up a notch. I made this a day before serving and it set perfectly. So much for my diet as I just ate two more slices for breakfast:( 
This is now my go to key lime pie recipe, thanks for submitting!

This was my first time making a key lime pie.  I looked at several recipes but this one stood out, not jut for its high ratings but because it did not call for egg yolks.  The sour cream was different as well.  I made two pies, one for my family and one for my coworkers.  It was a hit both at home and at work.  My husband loves the texture and everyone at work thought the sweetness to tartness ratio was perfect.  I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe! Very easy except for squeezing all of those tiny key limes! So worth it though :). As others mentioned I didn't detect any holes so I baked for 10 minutes at 350 and then chilled. I made whipped topping and covered the pie with it before serving. YUM!

My husband is the key lime pie lover in the family and we made this for his birthday - we all loved it and it is so fast and easy!!  We only had time to chill it for a couple hours and it was great -- my daughter (7) didn't like the "green floaties" (zest) lol - but otherwise huge success!

This is truely the easiest Key Lime Pie I've ever made. I followed the recipe with two minor changes and it turned out great. I didn't use the grated lime peel(not a big fan) and I baked it for 11 Min. I will make this again and again.

Really good and really quite easy.  I was dubious about the short bake time, but it had already begun to set up by the time I got it into the crust.  I did bake closer to 12 min.

We used to get key lime pie for $26 from a fancy hotel/resort that was amazing and since we moved haven't been able to find anything as good....until now. I made this last night and my husband and I were so impressed and he said it tastes just like the one we used to love! It was super easy to make. The only thing that took a lot of time and was hard on my hands was squeezing the limes. but it is so worth it! I can't wait to make this for a dinner party. I made homemade whipped cream with sugar and vanilla to spread over it.

I usually use a recipe that requires eggs so I was very interested to try this egg-free version.
I much rather this recipe's texture; its rich and creamy as opposed to pudding-like, as it is with the egg based recipe. 
The only thing I wasn't a fan of, and I suppose this comes down to personal taste, was using two cans of sweetened condensed milk as it was far too sweet for me. I've since cut this back to 1.5 425g cans.
For those bakers living in Australia, I make my own biscuit base with 18 Arnnots Nice biscuits (crumb in the food processor or whack the living daylights out of them with a rolling pin in a ziplock bag), 100g unsalted melted butter and a good pinch of cinnamon. Mix well then press into a 8-inch pie dish using a dessert spoon. Cook for 15 min at 180c. Cool slightly before dumping in the pie filling (you'll need 4-6 "normal" limes) and cook at the same temperature for 12 min.

This is the easiest dessert I've ever made and it was so good, my family wanted me to make it twice...so I did.  I made the crust from graham crackers, butter and tourbino sugar and it cooked just fine in the 20 minutes it took for the custard to lightly bubble.  I added more lime than the recipe called for in the first batch because my gang likes it tart.  In the second batch I ran out of 'extra' lime, so I add bottled lemon juice and it was even better!  This is a perfect dessert.

Followed the recipe exactly. Shortly before serving, covered with (real) whipped cream, then sprinkled each slice with lime zest before serving. Perfect. Not too sweet, not too tart. And rich, so cutting the pie into 8 pieces was the perfect serving size.  I got raves from my guests.

I have been dying to make this for some time.  I forgot to get sour cream when I purchased the ingredients and was determined to make it.  I used the Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice instead of squeezing all those limes.  I substituted cream cheese for the sour cream (because I had it in the refrig) and it turned out great!  After mixing it I tasted it before baking to see if I wanted to add a bit more lime juice.  I did add a little more juice and turned out wonderful!  I will be making it time and time again!

Amazingly authentic flavor!  My favorite Key Lime pie recipe now!  I shaved some long pieces of lime zest and laid  them on top. Other than that no changes, had to much filling but thats ok. Never saw the little bubbles on top, baked it about 6 minutes then refrigerated.

Made this for the first time today.  It came out perfect, except that the graham  cracker crust (homemade) was a little crumbly.  Squeezed 22 key limes to get 3/4 cup juice, may use bottled next time.  Never saw any bubbles while baking, just took it out after 10 minutes and chilled it.  Delish!!!

I didn't like key lime pie first few times I tried it. This recipe has turned key lime pie into a new family addiction. Wonderful recipe without any changes whatsoever.

Great recipe.   I had to use 1 regular lime because out of a whole bag of key limes, I only yelded approximately 1/2 cup of juice.

My husband's mini key lime tree produced about 20 key limes this summer and they all dropped recently around the same time. What to do when life hands you key limes? Make key lime pie! 

I stumbled across this very simple and wonderful recipe. I made a couple of accidental edits, so I'll share them here. I had a small 8 oz container of sour cream - and when I scooped out the required amount, there wasn't much left in the cup, so I just used the whole 8 oz. container. That said, I used 2 whole cans of the sweetened condensed milk - as it came to 28 oz., and I believe this recipe calls for 24 oz. It was the perfect ratio. My husband hand-squeezed the limes (and out of the 20 or so that dropped, he probably used about 12 - some were much bigger than others). We rolled them on the counter first to extract more juice from each one. We strained the juice to get rid of the seeds. I didn't have the ability to get a whole tablespoon of zest, so I probably got more like a teaspoon, but it was perfect as it was. Everything else was done according to the instructions. 

The end results was a perfectly set pie and a wonderful blend of sweet and tart. We didn't garnish with a single thing. If we had, it would have likely taken this recipe over the top. 

Will I make this again? YES! I have never done so before because I thought it would be a hassle. It was certainly not. This particular recipe was really great and I wonder if the person who posted it has another recipe that includes a meri

I love this recipe. It's super creamy with exactly the right amount of tart and richness. I have just two notes: 1) this pie is way better if you make it the night before you serve it, the flavors just meld together so much better. 2) I never saw the bubbles, and I've made this pie 5-6 times and it never fails that it needs to cook closer to 12-14 minutes vs 8. Very delicious. Very simple.

So authentic, just like my grandma used to make in Florida. I used three cans condensed milk because of the way they measured in the measuring cup. I probably baked it for about 30-40 minutes because I never got bubbles. Let it set in fridge for an hour before I added whipped topping. So delicious. The firmness of it is unbelievable!

Delicious. This is a great summertime treat. I make mine in a 12 inch spring form pan with a homemade graham cracker crust, it looks so fancy that way, and I like the filling to crust ratio better than with a smaller pie plate.

I have made this as one large pie and also as individual pies.  Both ways it has worked out very well.  Delicious.  I have used bottled key lime juice when I can't get key limes and used the zest of a regular lime and the recipe is still good.  I have also used reduced fat sour cream and this has been an unnoticeable substitution.  Nice, easy, pretty and delicious dessert!

This recipe is delicious! I used the recipe to make mini tarts with graham crusts and they were very easy and turned out fantastic. We also threw a catered event and I requested these tarts be made. They were done with a traditional tart shell and they were the most delicious dessert there! Highly recommended.

This was an easy and tasty recipe! I added some extra lime (for a more tart flavor), a little extra sour cream, and used a coconut whipped cream and lime garnish. It was very decadent - a little too decadent for my taste - but it was definitely very easy and fun to make.

Great! Just a pinch to limey for me. Next time I will use 1 tsp zest instead of a tbsp.  It was also a little sweet for my taste, I will use 3/4 c. sour cream next time. Definitely, use a deep dish. It makes a ton of filling.

Easy to make.  I used Nellie & Joe's Famous Key Lime juice because I couldn't find any key limes in my area.  I know die hard key lime pie foodies say you havecto use fresh but don't let that stop you from using Nellie & Joe's if that is all you can get your hands on.  It turned out great.  I would make it again!  You can probably get away with 2 cans of condensed milk since you use a 9 inch graham cracker crust.   If you use 3 cups, you need 3 cans and will end up wasting some.

This is SO easy to make and absolutely delicious! Only my bestie makes better (and I'm not talented enough to do her "from scratch.")!  This is a great "no egg" option. It is my "go to" for desserts to bring to potlucks and parties!  It is even going with me for Thanksgiving for the second year-by request!

It might not be as good as Key Lime pie from Key West, but it is easy to make, doesn't last long and gets tons of compliments!  My daughter has made it a few times - and follows the recipe exactly.  She has used pre-made crust and homemade.  Each time it turned out great.

I LOVED THE PIE. I used pre-made graham cracker crust. I had it last night, and my dinner guests loved it. I am TOTALLY making it again for Thanksgiving 2016

This pie has gotten rave reviews multiple times from my dinner guests! I made the pie with a homemade graham cracker crust, and also added fresh homemade whipped cream. If you only use one side of your line for the zest, you can cut it into lime wheels after and add on top of whipped topping for a prettier presentation. Don't change anything about the recipe for the pie itself; it's perfect exactly as it is written.

I would never make this recipe again. It makes WAY TOO MUCH filling. I made my normal graham cracker crust in a 9-inch glass pie dish that I always have used for custard pies. I had to run to the store to pick up more graham crackers to make a second pie! Try the Classic Key Lime Pie instead! Essentially the same pie but NORMAL filling.  If you'd use a deep dish pie dish it would MAYBE fit, but even that is pushing it.

Made this with fresh key limes instead of the bottled, and topped with homemade coconut whipped cream. It was amazing! Perfectly tart and full of flavor.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It is very tart, which is what I want from key lime!  I put mine in individual cup cakes, cool for about 45 minutes, and then peel off the cupcake liner. It makes the prettiest display and eliminates plates and forks. My dinner guests always pick them up and eat them as a finger food. I get asked to make this recipe more than any other one!

Have made this numerous times, has become a favorite of family and friends. The only thing I change is I use regular limes with the addition of one or two lemons instead of the key limes. Super tangy and yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this was incredible.  Couldn't find key limes, so used regular limes you can always find at the grocery store. It took 6 medium limes to get 3/4 of a cup of lime juice.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  

It turned out light and creamy with a lovely, fresh lime flavor.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but even I ate two pieces in one sitting!!!

A previous reviewer mentioned using a garlic press to juice the limes and that was a GREAT idea!  had to quarter them, but I got all the juice out of those limes with very little effort.

Good pie.  It was sweeter than I was hoping it would be.  Next time I may try making my own sweetened condensed milk so I can use less sugar.  I also couldn't find fresh key limes so I bought key lime juice from concentrate.  I would definitely look a little harder for fresh next time.

This was a huge hit at one of our church small group dinners.  I made a crust in stead of using a pre made one(stale graham crackers dried out nicely in the oven) and learned that juicing as many key limes as were required takes more than two minutes.  The end result was worth it though!

This was incredibly easy and tasty! I agree with others, it took about 20 key limes for 3/4 cup of juice.  I used 2 14oz cans of fat free condensed milk; I discarded 4oz (1/2 cup) then just used the other 24oz (i.e. 3 cups).  This filled out my 9" graham cracker crust perfectly; I made the crust out of reduced fat graham crackers and also added pecans when processing.  I am not a fan of sour cream, so I substituted Greek yogurt; this turned out great.  I'm considering using my favorite Ellenos lemon curd Greek yogurt in the future to see what that's like.  Lastly, I added a little key lime juice and zest to my whipped cream; this made the flavors marry together nicely and made garnish optional.

This was my first attempt at Key Lime Pie - wish I had been making this for years!  I received nothing but rave reviews on this when I served it as Mini Pies using prepared 5" graham cracker crusts.  One recipe serves 12 mini pies.  

The only thing that didn't work out for me was the juicing of the key limes.  I found that I got only HALF the juice expected from everyone else's reviews.  I guess in Wisconsin we don't get the best (biggest & juiciest) key limes.  Argh.  

Other than having to juice my 55 key limes (2#) & still having to supplement the lime juice, these were exceptional.  Just hope I can find some bigger key limes next time!

This was a delicious and easy treat. I noticed that you could still taste the sweetened condensed milk after baking, but that was my only issue. Otherwise a great recipe.

Fabulous pie. I used 8 regular limes and 2 cans of condensed milk. Bought the Keebler 10 inch graham cracker crust. My first pie was gone in a day so I made a second, 3 days later to share at work. I will be very popular tomorrow!

Perfect lime tartness to creamy sweetness ratio. Followed recipe almost exactly. I added a little bit more in lime rines because I wanted it to be especially tart. Mine had barely any bubbles and they didn't burst so I left it in for as long as the recipe called for and then chilled it. I didn't want to risk it browning.  It turned out fine even without the bubbles.

I used ½ c Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice and ¼ c fresh squeezed lemon juice and doubled the amount of lime zest. I whipped it a bit extra with a mixer, and it fills a large pie crust (the rest goes into a few little tart crusts). Baked it 12-14 minutes. After cooling in fridge overnight I drizzled fresh lime juice over the top, and then decoratively covered with lime slices. This is the perfect key lime pie from a simple, egg-free recipe.

Despite being super easy, I did not care for this at all, the taste and texture is completely off. I prefer more light and airy, not heavy like custard. I'll keep searching for the perfect recipe, definitely without sour cream.

This was an easy and fantastic recipe  - turned out super creamy and delicious!  I have a bunch of limes in my backyard, so I used about 6 large limes to get 3/4 cup of juice.  I usually make my own graham crackers crust, but had six store bought mini graham cracker crusts, so I used those thinking the filling would fit..... When the mini shells were completely full, I still had half the filling left! So I filled a few ramekins with the remaining filling, topped with a few crushed graham crackers mixed with a little sugar and butter, and baked them for about 10 to 12 minutes until the graham crackers topping was crisp.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, the mini pies and my improvised key lime pie "crisp" were both delicious!  Thanks for a great and versatile recipe!

Fabulous recipe - the sweetness is tamed by the sourness of the key lime juice. One note- the recipe calls for 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk (750ml), but should only be 2 x 300ml cans (for a total of 600ml).

Best Lime pie ever!! I used 4 regular limes for the 3/4 cup of juice, as couldn't locate any Key Limes that day... Made it as it was written and it was the absolute best! Don't change a thing!

One of the best pies I've ever tasted and extremely easy. Had to use regular limes as key limes weren't available (6 or 7 gave 3/4 cup juice). Used the lime zest, perfect balance of sweet and tangy in my opinion. Made a homemade crust and whipped cream, still very quick and simple.

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday.  Everyone loved it, except for a few of the kids.  I was told that it tasted better than some of the pies in Florida.  I used Nellie and Joe's key lime juice.  It was super easy and fast.  I will be making this again!

Fabulous flavor!!!!!!!!!! We couldn't stop eating this - finished the entire pie in one go. The only problem was the texture. Maybe the issue was the fact that the condensed milk was homemade, but we found this so liquidy - the pieces fell apart, and we scooped it up with spoons.  Still, it was worth it, and I'd make it again in a flash.

This was my first attempt at key lime pie and it was perfect and tasted very authentic.  A few things...I used full fat Fage Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I actually think this improved the recipe (in my opinion).  Also, I forgot the lime zest, but it still tasted awesome.  A note about the cooking time, and this may apply to others using old (or maybe just mine?) ovens.  After 5 minutes, I checked for bubbles on top and there was nothing.  I checked every 2-3 minutes from then on and still no bubbles.  I kept going but worried I did something wrong.  At just under the 25 minute mark, I finally started seeing bubbles.  I'm guessing my apartment oven must be working at a much lower temperature than it's supposed to.  Anyway, this tasted perfect and my family loved it.  I actually think it tastes much better the next day once fully chilled and all the flavors set in.

Very easy to make and delicious!  First time I ever made a key lime pie.  My husband always orders it in restaurants and he really loved this.
Because condensed milk comes in cans of 28oz, I use all of it and it still tastes great.  If too sweet, you can add more lime juice.

The simplicity and deliciousness of this pie has earned it a spot next to my most  tried-and-true recipes. I used 4 or 5 regular limes. I also used pre-made crust from Publix because I am partial to the traditional crust as opposed to graham cracker. It turned out amazing! Such a crowd pleaser! I top it with homemade whipped cream.

Amazing and easy recipe - always my go to. Today I substituted strawberries because I didn’t have key limes on hand. I put 6 large strawberries in a blender, added 2 tbsp. preserves, and 1 tsp. lemon juice, then combined with the milk and sour cream. The cooking time was much longer for it to set but also amazing!

Cut this in half to fill 6 mini graham crusts. Used 1 can Eagle Brand, 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and almost half a cup of lime juice. Baked 6 minutes.  Yummy and so easy. Thanks for sharing

Hands down the easiest, quickest, and most delicious recipe I have ever found for cream pie. I have used this recipe, and several variations of it, many times now without ever having one issue. I always use 2 cans (14oz) sweetened condensed milk per pie, and instead of sour cream I use plain Greek yogurt or plain whole milk yogurt. I have substituted the key lime juice with lemon juice, grapefruit juice, pink grapefruit juice, and several other citrus juices (and substituted their perspective zest as well)  with the exact same results; perfect! For a twist, I also have used shortbread cookie crumb crust as well as gingersnap cookie crumb crust with equal success as a substitute for the graham cracker crust.  Thanks for a showstopper of a dish!

Baked to instructions, with a homemade graham cracker crust...but when I took it out of my springform pan, it turned into a soup mess all over my counter! Although it did taste quite delicious from what got stuck on my hands. Unfortunately, eating it off the floor was not an option.

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly (minus the lime zest as I'm not fond of it) every single time. I've made this 4 times and every time it was gone in 5 minutes at every party because after the first person tried it, the news quickly spread to grab some before it was gone!  I use 2 cans of condensed milk. I also have used key limes and regular limes but I didn't taste much of a difference. It was a hit either way. But if I did use regular limes, I added a hint of freshly squeezed lemon too. I actually prefer the regular medium/large limes bc they were easier to use on the juicer.

This has become my quintessential Key Lime Pie.  At first I was sceptical, because there are no eggs in the recipe. I wasn't sure how it would firm up when baking, but it is perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this tasted better on day 2. Next time  I'll make it a little ahead of time. I used a store bought crust which was totally fine. I used extra creamy cool whip and mixed 1/4 cup powdered sugar in and a half teaspoon of vanilla. Half of a cool whip container  would be plenty. I used a whole  and it was too much. Got lots of compliments on this pie. I would definitely make it again. It is really easy and super quick as long add you can find key lime juice. I had to juice my own, hope to never do that again!

The pie was fantastic!  Will definitely make this recipe again.   I followed the recipe as written, as other reviewers have said the tiny air bubbles when baking are hard to see. I ended up baking this for 11 minutes in my oven in the texture was perfect. We took this to a barbecue over the holiday weekend and got rave reviews from all who had a piece !

I made this for a Fourth of July party yesterday. It was a HUGE hit! I heard people talking about how good it was, and they didn't even know I made it. It made me super star! And it is so easy.  I will give 2 tips. One, Walmart sold a bag of 20 key limes and that was exactly right. Be sure to strain your juice before adding it to other ingredients, You might have seeds in there. Also, I did the full 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk, which is 2 cans PLUS about 2/3 cups from a third can. The only reason I didn't just use the 2 cans was because I was also working on another recipe that didn't call for a the whole can of sweetened condensed milk and had some left over, which turned out perfectly. I guess if I had just used the 2 cans it wouldn't have been as sweet and maybe not as good? I'm not sure I'm willing to try it that way now that everyone thought this one was so good.

Used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I had a lot of leftover filling, so I made another smaller crust. Next time I will make two 8 inch graham crusts and I think it will be perfect -- definitely no left overs. Texture is so creamy and tastes a lot like a cheesecake. Absolutely wonderful recipe (except for the gazillion calories! ).This will be my go-to recipe for cheesecake and key lime now. Try it -- you will not be disappointed.

made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  i also did not see the bubbles and ended up leaving it an extra five minutes (so total of 13 minutes) before pulling it out out of fear of over baking.  came out amazing.  i also used my own gluten free crust, since my husband is a celiac.  huge hit.  everyone wanted the recipe.  thanks for sharing!

Only used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, which I guess comes out to 2.5 cups... and the end result was BITTER.  There is a fine line between sour and bitter, and this was clearly the latter.  Next time, I will use the full 3 cups of SCM and  a little less lime zest - maybe add more sugar to my sweetened whipped cream.

Absolutely the best Key Lime Pie I've ever eaten!   The only changes I made were (1)  I added 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, which measured approximately 2 1/2 cups.   Another half-cup would have made the pie too sweet; and (2) I added only about 2 teaspoons of grated lime zest, and that was plenty.   I'm not usually keen on using zest, but it really did enhance the flavor of this pie.   I baked my pie for a full 8 minutes.    I used 8 fresh limes (3/4 c. juice)  vs. bottled juice.  Everyone I shared the pie with loved it!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious!  I love key lime pie, especially in the summer time because it is such a refreshing and light dessert.  I normally make another recipe that has cream cheese as the base ingredient and wanted to try a different version.  So I picked this one and I'm so glad that I did!  This one is a bit more sweet and richer than the other recipe that I make and has a little more of a creamier texture.  But it is soo good that I will have to add this version to make along with our other favorite.  I did cook it 10 min. total and only saw maybe 3 little tiny bubbles on the top.  It sat up in the fridge perfectly.  2 cans of condensed milk almost equals the 3 cups.  And since I didn't have key limes, I used regular limes and it took 3 large limes to make the full 3/4 cup of juice for the recipe.  Thank you for the delicious recipe!!  It is so good!

Made it for a dinner party & everyone loved it!  Made it with regular limes & it was delicious.  Only 1 guest remarked that it didn't taste like the Key Lime pies she'd tasted previously.  So, next time I will forage further for the real deal.  Still, it's delicious & refreshing & SO EASY!

I was with family in Hawaii and we had way too many limes from a trip to Costco. I made this with regular limes, and it was still wonderful. So easy, so delicious, and as I was sneaking tastes of the filling, I decided I'd like to make some popsicles out of this stuff.

Wow.  Absolutely amazing.  I made the recipe exactly as directed.  I squeezed key limes instead of buying a bottle of the juice.  A one pound bag of key limes made enough juice for this recipe.

This is one of my favorite Key Lime recipes ever! I'm a Jersey Girl & even my FL friends tell me it tastes like it was made from real Key Limes! An awesome easy, "cheat" recipe & not you will know. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because I made a couple adjustments. I used 2 full (14 oz) cans sweetened cond milk & a 2 heaping tablespoon more than the 3/4 cup sour cream to fill my 9 oz (Keebler) graham cracker crust. Enjoy!

Overall, this pie was VERY good! I did make a few slight changes- no disrespect intended; its kind of my trademark to not follow a recipe exactly! Initially the filling was too sweet so I added more lime juice and then a little more sour cream to compensate for the extra liquid ; also increased zest to almost 2 tablespoons. I baked it for about 14 minutes instead of the recommended 8 minutes and it still didn't brown- it actually baked the perfect amount of time.

I've made this twice now and have had great results. Perfect recipe for  a quick dessert. Best made the day before or refrigerated overnight. I used key limes the first time I made the pie and a bottled key lime juice the second time and couldn't  tell the difference between the two. The flavor was great using either.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will not use sour cream. It cut the taste of the lime. It was really tasty though. I will be making this again. Served it with whipped cream and it was delicious.

I used 8 mexican limes to get 3/4 cup of juice, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, as recommended by reviewers, light sour cream and the zest.  I made a home made crust with the crumbs from 8 full graham crackers, 6 T of melted butter and 1/3 cup of sugar, packed firmly into a 9 inch pie pan and pre baked for 6 minutes at 350. The filling was the perfect amount for the 9 inch pie pan, and it was FABULOUS! Even my husband, who doesn't crave key lime pie, as I do, said it was the best he ever had.

Great recipe! Super easy. Didn't take the full twenty limes (used Persian limes not keys) filling was enough for one and half pies, may need to adjust measurements for less waste. Sure was good though! Wasn't bitter at all, tart and sweet, very rich. Make sure your condensed milk is the sweetened kind. :)

Excellent recipe, but I need to comment on the graham cracker crust.  Living in Florida, I read a research article on Key Lime Pie in a 1987 Ft. Lauderdale paper.   It stated the crust of the Key West original pie was a pastry crust as graham crackers were not in existence.  I follow the Key West original crust and it does justice to the very sweet filing.  Too sweet for the rich graham cracker  crust.  Mother Butler's pie store never made it with anything but pastry crust.  It was superb

This was very easy. I made my own graham cracker crust which was two packs of Honey Maid Graham Crackers, crushed and 1 1/2 sticks of salted butter, softened. I loved it and the two comments I got from two different people were, "This is something that you'd find at a nice restaurant." and, "I tried not to eat that so fast, but I couldn't help it." If you make this and refrigerate it over night, it is even better. I also made my own strawberry topping, which was 12-16 oz strawberries and 1 cup sugar, cooked on med-high in a sauce pan for 20 minutes, then cooled overnight. Home made whip cream was also a great topping and doesn't steal any of the glory from the key lime like the strawberries do. Use a spring-form pan for easy slicing and serving.

Love how easy this pie is to make, however, I found that it was a bit too tart and too sweet for my liking. Plan to use half the amounts of both lime juice and condensed milk next go round and use more sour cream

This is a pretty nice pie.  I added 1 egg yolk to firm up the filling.  I also used freshly squeezed key lime juice.  I'm pretty picky about my key lime pie and this recipe is fire!

I followed the recipe the best I could. I used two 14 oz cans of condensed milk, bottled key lime juice, the zest of one lime, and  cooked it until the center didn't jiggle. It takes a few hours to chill. It's delicious! I doubled the recipe. It looked too liquidy at first, but turned out great.

Quick, easy, simple ingredients! I had to buy Key Lime juice, b/c where I live geographically it is darn near impossible to get Key limes. It was simply amazing, even using Key Lime juice!!! will make this many times. Thank you!!!

The key lime pie is delicious! However, the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is that I spent a while squeezing the key lime juice. I didn't have a juicer, or a garlic press or any of that. I also didn't really add the zest to it, I only added about  1 tsp. but it turned out great, so it was well worth it.

This is my go to key lime pie recipe. I up the amounts to accommodate the amount I need, and I skip the baking all together. It doesn't affect the finished product. 3 cans condensed milk, 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup lime juice. Just mix, pour and chill. Perfection every time.

Yes! By all means, make this. I wanted to make this for mother's day, and it was super easy to prepare. The texture was perfect, and it had a tart, tangy flavor. This is a recipe I'll be using for years to come!

Second review 6/23/18--During the past 2 years, I have made this pie several times for  different groups, and each time it is a hit! Yesterday, I used lemons that I had.  Used fat-free condensed milk (Could not tell the difference!).  Again, a wonderful pie that received rave reviews. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!!

Tasted delicious. Had to give it 4 stars because it was a little on the sweet side for my family since we're not used to very sweetened food, but if it wasn't for that I would have gave it 5 stars. Flavor was spot on for key lime pie.

LOVE IT!!! I didn't do the fresh squeezed lime, instead did the lime juice. My boyfriend and mother loved it! Perfectly sweet, no overbearing lime flavor. Definitely will be a staple in my household! Can't go wrong with this recipe.

So, I whipped this up last night. It was quick and easy. However, I felt that it did not nearly enough key lime flavor. I used bottled key lime juice instead of freshly squeezed and skipped the zest (which may have made the difference). I love tart key lime pie, so I will try this recipe again with twice as much juice.

I'm sure that this recipe does not need one more review, but maybe my experience will help someone else - I live in Mexico, where there are NO graham crackers, but I can occasionally find a premade graham cracker crust at our local Walmart or Costco. (Go figure.)  So I take two of them, dump them into a food processor and add a bit (1/4 cup) of melted butter and the same amount of sugar. Whip it up and then I use an 11-inch tart pan for the pie. I also top it with whipped cream and some grated lime zest. It is beautiful and it is delicious. Thanks for the fine recipe.

I live in the Keys 7 months out of the year and travel to Ohio for the other 5... left my Key Lime Pie recipe at the other house :-( I found this one; an exact match to the one I use. I DO make my own graham cracker crust :-) My many many friends have stated that this is the BEST Key Lime Pie they have ever had; ONE TIP: Serve the slices with whipped cream and a small wedge of Key Lime on each slice. I have also put them into mini paper-lined foil cupcake papers and brought them to BBQs etc with whipped cream and limes on the side... always a BIG bite-sized hit!! ENJOY this "taste of the islands"!!

This recipe tastes just like the one in restaurants. P.S if you are using actual limes it is about 20 of them, if you are using lime juice from the bottle it is 1, 4.0 fl oz or 118ml. you should defiantly try this recipe!

I followed the directions exactly except I used a store bought graham cracker  crust.  The pie was way too sweet.  The consistency was too thick.

This was AWESOME! First pie recipe in a long time; I will note, IT MUST BE ZEST. DON'T DO WHAT I DID AND JUST PEEL THE LIME THEN CUT THE PEEL INTO SMALL PIECES. IT WON'T WORK.

This worked perfectly.  Though I hadn't previously worked with key limes and wasn't expecting the time consuming juicing process.  I used three cans of sweetened condensed milk like other reviewers.  I put this key lime pie on top of a warm-from-the-oven cheesecake and baked it for 8 minutes, followed by chilling overnight. The key lime pie layer was tart and perfectly solidified.

This is as good as Costco's offering for key lime pie and very easy.  I will say that 2 cans of evaporated milk yielded the perfect amount of sweetness. I followed the rest of the recipe as it is written. I baked for 6 minutes but never saw bubbles.  Considering skipping this step completely next time.

This was a great pie.  I made it for a get together and everyone loved it.  I was a little short on key limes so I used just under 3/4 cup and I was short on the condensed milk.  I used 2 cans which didn't come out to 3 cups.  Nonetheless, it was very tasty and I'll make it again.  I made my own graham crust using  Graham Cracker Crust I.  There wasn't quite enough filling but it could be because I was a little short on ingredients.  Next time I'm going to try freezing it and covering a slice in chocolate like they do in Key West.

Awesome recipe! Very easy and tastes great. I didn't have key limes so I used normal ones and added a 1/2 cup of sugar and it still worked really well

Delicious!  My boyfriend and I both loved it.  I think it needed more time to bake so I plan on baking it longer next time I make it.  But so simple and easy!

This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly, it only has a few ingredients and the outcome was very pleasing. My daughter and I tried key lime pie in Florida for the first time and this was even better than the restaurant. Thank you for this recipe!

Pie easy to prepare, cooks easily and presents great. Family found it to be too sweet though. If I make it again, will probably try to cut down or substitute some of the sweetened condensed milk

Great recipe..I did add 4 oz of cream cheese/ greek yogurt blend for extra creamy  texture and after squeezing an entire bag of key limes I was short a scant amount of juice so I added tangerines juice to make it up..THIS WAS BIG LOVE!

Like others, I only used 2 cans of the sweetened condensed milk. Overall I thought the pie was pretty good, but prefer the more standard recipe that uses eggs. This recipe was pretty dense and rich.

Um not sure what went wrong.... I followed the directions, well actually I baked it for 30 min because it never set.... Chilled overnight - still not set... Pretty disappointed since I'm pregnant and totally craving key lime pie!!! Kind of surprised I had these results with so many positive reviews....

Simply amazing and foolproof!  Loved by everyone who ate it!  I let my pies cook until I saw tiny bubbles popping at the surface which was around 15 minutes (twice as long as the suggested cooking time).  Also, tastes even better with a homemade graham crust.  Will absolutely make again!

I think I made this pie for the first time in 2001. Its been in regular rotation since then and we still love it. Yesterday, I tried a variation that I wanted to share. I saw they now have sweetened condensed coconut milk in the store, so I used one can regular and one can coconut. It tasted awesome; however, it never really set and was goopy. I'll make the coconut version again for my family, but not for anyone else!

Oh my god... I made this with only 2 CANS of sweetened condensed milk (around 2 and 1/4 cups), about an eighth of a cup less sour cream, graham cracker crust, and Persian limes instead of key limes. I had several family members exclaim this is better than any key lime pie they've ever had. I can only imagine where this recipe would be with the real thing! I'll be writing this recipe down, this is something I'll be making yearly.

This was so easy to make as one of my Christmas desserts.  I let the butter and cream cheese sit out about 5 hours so they were super soft. I used about 8-10 fresh limes, instead of store bought lime juice.  After baking the pie for about 8-10 minutes.  I let cool, and I refrigerated over night. The pie was perfect.  It had a light and fluffy tastes. It gelled together perfectly. The next time I make it , I will actually make the crust instead of using the store bought, I found the store bought crust to be a tad bit dry.  Overall the pie was excellent.  I would definitely recommend.

Was told it was the best key lime pie EVER by those I shared it with.   I substituted about two teaspoonsful of fresh lemon juice  for key lime juice at the suggestion of one blogger, who claimed it takes the bitter tart out of the aftertaste of key lime pie, and that blogger was right on.  I also made my own graham cracker crust.  Wonderful recipe.

I used vanilla wafers for the crust instead of graham crackers. I also used fresh Persian lime juice.   It was the favorite pie at Thanksgiving this year.

This is my first time rating a recipe on any website.  This was also my first time at making a key lime pie.  My husband has particular tastes and likes extremely tart key lime pies.  I made this recipe exactly as written.  My only neutral comment was that I had way too much filling for my graham cracker crust.  I believe I over filled the crust.  I probably could have made 2 key lime pies with this recipe.  Therefore, I had to cook it much longer than the recipe called for.  However, when it was done and we savored it on Thanksgiving Day, it was perfection!  It was the biggest hit of all the pies I made (I made 9 total!) and my husband was in love.  He told me to use more lime juice and zest next time to make it more tart ... however, everyone else said it had the perfect blend of sweetness to tartness.  Even my father-in-law who is the pickiest eater I know LOVED it.  I have a gluten intolerance so I made my own gluten-free graham cracker crust and no one was the wiser.  Absolutely delicious!!!  It was also incredibly easy to put together.  It took no time at all and even with cooking it longer, it wasn't in the oven for more than 20 minutes.  Will DEFINITELY make again!  Probably for Christmas LOL.  Next time, I will make 2 pies with this recipe :)

My husband is a Florida native and grew up on traditional Key Lime pie.  Short on time as usual, I used a prepared graham cracker crust, bottled key lime juice from the Florida Keys, and 2 cans of fat-free condensed milk. The only thing I did differently was to add 2 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice to the filling mixture. Fabulous, easy and oh-so-good. You have to try this!

I made this pie for thanksgiving this year along with two other pies. This one was gone immediately. I made as is minus the line zest. It turned out so creamy. Some key lime pies come out overpowering with lime. This one was subtle and perfect without overpowering your taste buds. Can't wait to make again!

Great recipe. Easy to make. Substituted sugarless yogurt for the sour cream. Don't leave out the zest, it gives it a great kick of flavor.

Fantastic!!! I cooked it more like 10 minutes and never saw any bubbles come up but felt it was done.  My neighbor lent me her small handheld citrus press which juiced the limes really quickly.  She thinks the dollar store has them in stock so am adding a citrus press to my kitchen gadget pile.

This is a great pie. Just a note that if you live in Florida and get your key limes ripe falling right off the tree, they are so juicy that you will have your 3/4 cup of key lime juice with just about a 1/2 dozen key limes so be sure to measure. The garlic press for squeezing is a GENIUS tip. Thank you ljm4mr for that! My first pie came out a little tart, according to my father, who is the family's biggest celebrated host, foodie, and recipe critic. The antidote to tartness--or for those who just like things sweeter--is to add a little (or a lot of) sugar depending on the sweet tooth of your audience. On the one hand the sweetened condensed milk should be sweet enough, but for those who believe dessert can never be too sweet, or that you should always add more sugar than the recipe calls for, go ahead and add some regular white sugar, according to taste.

This was the first time I ever made key lime pie. The recipe is so easy and turns out great! I made it for my friend's birthday and everyone loved it! 20 key limes really does turn out to be 3/4 of a cup on the dot, but I had the birthday girl taste it to see if it was tart enough. We like our lime pie really tart so I added more juice. For those that don't like tartness I would recommend only adding a 1/2 cup of lime juice to start and then tasting it as more is added. This recipe was a huge hit!

I made the crust using one package (less two cookies that I ate) of Voortman's coconut cookies processed into crumbs and mixed with one stick of melted butter; pressed the mixture into a 10 pie plate; baked at 350F for 10 minutes.  Then used this filling.  Everyone loved it.

This is SO delicious!  I even ate 2 pieces in 1 setting.  Super easy!  I did make my own Graham cracker crust from scratch though, instead of a prepared 1.  I'll definitely make again!!

As another reviewer mentioned, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk is enough. I add 3 eggs yolks to make it more creamy. One bag of key limes is enough to make the 3/4 cup required. Used a crust recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction. Bake for 15 minutes, which is what other recipes with the added egg recommend.

Absolutely delicious!  Don't be put off by how simple this is to make because it is just delicious!  I have also made this in small single serve graham crusts for parties and they were gone instantly and everyone wanted the recipe.  I rarely see any bubbles when baking and usually bake for about 12 minutes. I think the baking is only needed to cause it to set up.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

I made it exactly as is and it was amazing! Perfect balance of sweet, sour and creamy. I added fresh whipped cream as a topping just to dress it up a bit, but not at all needed. Great Key Lime Pie recipe!

Here's the scoop: this recipe is pretty decent. However: it's too rich - I'd change the ratio of the milk and cream to be a bit heavier on the sour cream side (it was almost sickeningly sweet); the filling was too much for the crust, so I would recommend just filling the crust to level with the edge or maybe a bit more, but don't overdo it, as I did; using  the key limes from my neighbor's tree only required 11. But whatever it takes to get to 3/4 c. is cool. They were about 1/2 in to 1 inch in diameter.

I love this pie and I especially love that its super easy to make! I followed the instructions exactly except after 10 min of baking I really didn't see any bubbles bursting. I turned the oven off and left it in for 30 minutes. I then let it cool for an hour and then refrigerated overnight. It turned out great!

Loved it! Easy to make too. Just so you know it is tart and bitter but that is how traditional key lime pie is supposed to taste. If you want more of the sweet side, I'd look up sweet key lime pie  recipe or buy a store bought pie. But I love the traditional taste.

Excellent pie!    I make two changes.  First, I make my own crust.    Graham cracker crusts are easy and foolproof, and I think they are a lot tastier than pre-made.  It's also a fun way for kids to help:  Combine 1 1/2 c cracker crumbs (a little more than one packet),  1/8 c sugar, and 1/4 c melted butter.   Press into a pie tin and let cool before adding pie filling.        My second change is to add meringue.    In a *completely dry* mixing bowl, beat 4 egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add 6T sugar until the whites form stiff peaks.  Spread meringue over the pie, completely covering and SEALING EDGES.     Bake at 350 for 10- 15 min on a medium rack, until edges and tips of peaks are brown.   Chill before serving.

Currently making this for the second time in as many months. I also used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk. Took lots of shortcuts. Bought ready made graham cracker crust and bottled key lime juice. Still this is a great pie recipe.
Today's pies are being put in mini Graham cracker crusts .... for individual servings for the bunco girls coming over tonight.

This is the only KLP recipe we use. I've been to Key West many times and this rivals even the best @ the various restaurants there.
Don't fool with juicing key limes. Buy Nellis & Joe's Key West Lime Juice. Comes in 16 oz. bottle-found in bottled juices aisle in stores like Publix & Kroger. Make yr own crust if you have the time. Divine.

I love key lime pie and this recipe taste great and is easy to make.  I've made this recipe a few times and each time I get loads of compliments on how good it taste.  Not only that it is so easy to make.  The hardest part about this is squeezing the key limes.  Wal-ly world sales bags of key limes periodically.  I've used store bought graham cracker crust and have made my own.  Either way, its very good.  Key lime pie is typically extremely rich and sweet, so I only eat a little at a time.

Made this exquisite puppy.  Made my own graham cracker crust and my own topping.  The topping was 1/2 c sour cream + 1/2 c confectioners sugar..which was delicious, but doesn't belong on the pie...in fact, the pie needs NOTHING added, in our opinion..it's too sweet with the topping that I made.  This pie is a culinary delight.

My first key lime pie, and at the recommended temperature after 8 minutes it did not set. After 15 minutes, did not set. At 20 minutes I took it out and thought maybe it just needed to chill. After 5 hours it was not set, just a gloppy mess. Are we sure there isn't an egg missing somewhere? The taste was fine, but it did not turn into anything that could be cut into a pie slice without melting all over the plate. Probably user error, but...I really did everything the recipe said.

This was great. I used Mexican limes instead of key limes but you can't tell the difference. Everyone thought it was delicious and it really makes a very beautiful pie.

MAKE THIS PIE! I've  made this SUPER EASY pie three times, without the zest because I didn't have any, and I used bottled key lime juice. I use a shortbread crust instead of graham cracker. Let it sit over night to let the flavors mellow. Turns out fabulous! Gushing reviews from my family, including my own mom! 

This recipe opens itself up to all kinds of new pie flavors by using different juices and purees. I'm looking forward to caramelizing the sweetened condensed milk and making a salted caramel cream pie!!!!

Made this at home for my wife and I.  It was great!  Better than most restaurant Key Lime pies I've had.  Told a friend at ceremony about it and she made it for dinner.  People raved about it.  Quick, easy and wonderful flavor.

GREAT recipe! I made two for a family get-together and everyone loved it. Juicing the limes is a bit of a pain but I cut them in half & used a garlic press which worked well. 20 - 25 limes is about right for 3/4 c. of juice. Definitely saving this one.

HOLY COW!!! This pie was beyond awesome!  I had some friends over for dinner and when I pulled this beauty out of the fridge and they dug in, it became the topic of conversation for at least an hour.  They said it was by far the best key lime pie they have ever had hands down and they have had many different key lime pies and from some really upscale places.  I did make my own crust that I found on this site " Graham Cracker Crust I" which was perfect as well.  Like another review.. mine did not bubble so I ended up cooking for like 10-12 minutes. One of the main compliments I got on this pie was the texture of it. They were telling me that I really need to enter this into a pie contest. Thanks for making the me star of the night.

Oh wow!  This is amazing!  And SO simple!  I brought this in to work and watched my team inhale it.  One of the guys proposed to me on the spot (he knows I'm married, poor guy).  It's really that good!  Great key lime tartness with the creamy consistancy.  YUMMY!!!

This was my first time trying my hand at Key Lime pie. I love key lime, and was thrilled when my boyfriend asked for this as his birthday treat. I have a mini cupcake pan, and he asked that I make them in this.. so they are bite sized. I did, and they turned out great! The hardest part was the crust. I use the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site for all of my graham cracker crust needs. I scooped 1 rounded Tbsp of crust into each cup in the pan and pressed against the edges with a spoon. For the filling, I used 25 walnut sized key limes, halved them, and juiced them with a garlic press,  as recommended by one of the other reviewers. I did find that a cheese cloth would have been useful, as there were bits of seeds I needed to strain out. I used a thick paper towel and it took forever. I used the recommended 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and light sour cream. Filled them to the brim and baked for 9 min. They are delicious... and so cute!

This pie was amazing! I did not use key limes, but using normal limes I think was better because it was not too bitter tasting. Added whipped cream on top and it made the pie extra yummy! Added more lime juice and zest for that little bit of extra spunk! I would definitely make it again. And everyone at my parents work loved it!

I could not find 8 ounce cans of sweetened condensed milk so I used 3 cans, this way none would go to waste.  And in doing so,  I added a little more sour cream and lime juice.  Add the lime juice as you go or to taste.  
I also used a ready made pie crust and cooked the pie crust according to the directions on package before adding the filling.  This cut down on the "sweetness" factor.  
This is by far the BEST key lime pie, ever!!!

I will be making it again this week for a cookout.  The only change that I made was to add Splenda to the whipped cream instead of sugar to save on a few calories.  I also used a gluten-free graham cracker crust because my daughter is gluten intolerant.  It was the best Key Lime pie ever!

Delicious. Followed recipe, but purchased "Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice" at the store (instead of juicing the limes--easier and much cheaper) and it turned out great.

I was actually not a huge fan of this pie. A little sour and not very much lime taste. Definitely prefer a more custard-like pie which requires the eggs.

This recipe is awesome! I even decided to make it for my friend's wedding after trying it out earlier in the week with great success. My boyfriend says, "This tastes like you bought it at a restaurant!" Used 2 cans of sweetened-condensed milk and Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice (found at SafeWay). "Iced" the whole thing with Extra Creamy Cool Whip - perfection! I thought it tasted even better the next day. Will definitely be going back to this recipe again and again!

Great Recipe!!  After juicing all the key limes for this a chef friend of mine told me that our local grocer carries bottles of key lime juice, so I will definitely use that next time.  For anyone who feels it is too tart try a dollop of whip cream on top.  Really easy and amazing flavor.

First time I bake this pie and it was absolutely delicious !! Will be doing this again and again. A bit to sweet but what else can you expect, is condensed milk. As I live in the UK I can't find the Graham Crackers but I used the Mc Vities digestives which I use in all of my cheesecakes plus roasted caramelised pecans and the crust and pie were just superb!! Next time will try the crust with roasted almonds. yum yummmmmmmm

The recipe was good.  The directions and measurements were perfect.  My pie set fine, never got runny, and I did get the pinhole bubbles.  The pie looked beautiful with my homemade whipped cream and a lime garnish.  It just didn't taste really great.  I used 22 key limes, and found it to be quite bitter.  It's possible the limes I used were just bitter so I will try again next season with key limes or even bottled juice. My husband claimed to like it, but he's pretty nice.

This pie is delicious. I followed other's advice and only used only 1tsp of rind. I also used sugar in my graham cracker crust (4Tbsp soft butter, 1/4C sugar, 1&1/2C graham cracker crumbs). Took the pie out of the oven after 10 minutes and put it right into the refrigerator. Perfect!! And so easy!!

I just made this for July 4th. The pie turned out well but I didn't ever get the bubbles when baking. Also I will try it without the lime zest next time. The ingredients filled a 9" pie crust pan so I may divide it into 2 pie crust and top it with whip cream.

Filling didnt set. In never got firm so I ended up cooking it for more like 30 minutes then let it chill in the fridge for 3 hours. Also after cutting the pie gave off a runny juice . Flavor was also very sour.

I've made this pie about four times already and every time it turned out delicious. It's soooo key limy. Only alteration I made is I added 2 tbsp of lime zest instead of 1. Gives it that extra lime taste.

This pie is an easy five stars. It turned out beautiful and creative with the perfect amount of lime taste. I used Mexican limes instead of Keylime's so that I only had to squeeze six or so to get 3/4 cup fresh lime juice. (Hint: if you don't have a juicer, cut the limes in half, stick a fork in the pulp and twist over a bowl or measuring cup)  I topped with homemade whipped cream. What a great way to taste summer!

I have made this 3 times since I found it on All recipes in November. Made it for my dad on his birthday,  and again for Father's day..... then today, well, just because, I made mini key lime pies. SO DELICIOUS,  and SO incredibly easy to make!!!! A friend who doesn't even like key lime oie, said she would eat it again! I did make the recipe exactly as written, and used the garlic press to squeeze the juice from the key limes, which made it that much easier!! (the first time, I squeezed all the key limes.....by hand!!)

Easy, easy, easy... I am not very good (okay... I stink) at making pies (too runny, not runny enough...pie crust disasters). This recipe my friends is heaven sent. Easy to make, fool proof, not to expensive, you can make a few in a moment's time to feed a big crowd, and it tastes great. I strongly recommend if you are looking for a fool proof dessert to share at a gathering.

This is the only key lime pie recipe I'll ever use. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. The reviewer that said the pie was bitter may have over-zested the lime, unknowingly adding the bitter tasting layer of the flesh to the pie. Be careful not to go to far into the lime! I always make this in the morning and serve it at least 7-8 hours later. I pipe the edges of the pie with a simple homemade whipped cream at the halfway point of chilling (3-4 hours) so that it sets up nicely. A tiny sprinkle of lime zest (remember to be careful) adds a nice touch. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You for this easy recipe.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used regular limes instead of key limes and it still turned out perfect. Everyone loved it, and will definitely make again. The lime zest adds a nice touch so I'd recommend doing it. Also, made my own graham cracker crust with the recipe from this site. Yum.

I never had a good key lime pie, so I thought I didn't like them. My mother in law requested one. #7 changed my mind. It is easy and a great gift for a party. I did however tweak the recipe.
I substituted  1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk with regular condensed milk. A little less sweet without loosing the great flavor!

I made this as my first try at Key Lime Pie and it was great!  I definitely recommend it.  Just a quick side note, I like measuring our my ingredients (especially when I try a recipe for the first time) and I'm glad I did.  The standard "14 oz" can of condensed milk was actually barely 12 oz when I measured it so I would recommend measuring the condensed milk instead of just using 2 cans.  I'm sure it's not a big deal if you use a little less condensed milk but I think you'll get the consistent flavor every time by having the right ratios of all the ingredients.  Happy tastings!

This was perfect! I made it for Father's Day.  My dad and other family members loved it.  It took 20 minutes because I gave it a full 10 minutes to bake.  I also used regular limes because key limes were not available. The flavor was still fantastic.  I couldn't tell the difference.  
I should note that  2.5 cans of condensed milk  equaled 3 cups for me.

This pie is AMAZING! I made this pie for my dad for father's day and he loved it! Instead of using 20 limes, we found lime juice at Kroger's and used that. Also, I ended baking this in the oven for about 10 minutes instead of 8. Our pie turned out REALLY sweet though, so if you are looking for a tart pie, this is not it. It looks small, but it is really deep. Overall, great pie!

I made this and it was great!!! I was a little  concerned because a lot of other recipes I looked at had eggs, but this one did not. When I made it, it tasted super good. The only thing in this recipe that I did not follow was that it asked for key limes. I don't know where to get key limes so I just used regular limes and it was fine. To make 3/4 cup it took 7 limes.

This was pretty ggod but next time I will make my own crust as the lime flavor overpowered the keebler pre-made crust I used.  My son thought it was too limey so maybe I'll reduce the zest next time or skip it.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except using 2 cans of sweet condensed milk which was almost 3 cups and the pie was as good as any I have had from restaurants.

Needed a refreshing dessert after a heavy meal and decided to make the lime pie.My daughter used an egg to brush on the crust and baked for 10 to 12 minutes.Let cool before adding  the filling,then back in the oven. Didn't have sour cream so I used buttermilk.Didn't add the lime zest.Was the most refreshing pie ever!!Before serving we add whipped cream on top.! Next time will try with sour cream.

SO yummy!  This was the first time I tried a Key Lime Pie.  I had about 17 limes and doubled the recipe.  Made my own Graham Cracker crust.  ITS SO RICH BUT REALLY easy.  I will remember this for any potluck because it was cheap and easy

Wow! Very tart! I tasted the key lime juice and the flavor was intense, so I decided to add a brick of cream cheese and left out the lime zest. It still was very tart, but my husband loved it. It comes out lovely and the texture was wonderful. Next time I will add less lime juice and make my own crust. The store bought keebler graham cracker crust doesn't taste as good as if you make it your self.

SO GOOD! My MIL is very picky when it comes to key lime pie, but I know she loves it. I thought this recipe was too good to be true. So simple. But she loved it! She couldn't believe when I told her how I made it. Now I make it for her all the time!

The filling mixture didn't really want to firm up the first time I made this, and took a long time to chill. I added a brick of cream cheese the second time around and it was better. If you decide to add cream cheese, make sure you let it soften first. Straight from the fridge it will not mix well enough and you will have lumps. 3 stars since I had to alter the recipe. Very tasty to begin with, though.

I had a recipe for key lime pie that uses egg yolks, but I wanted to try one without eggs. I tried this recipe for the first time at a major function and it was a huge success. The guests kept talking about how perfectly balanced the taste was and I live in South Florida, so you know these folks are major Key Lime Pie critics. Don't know if I will ever use the old method again. Next time I'll try it on a coconut - graham crust....yum! Thanks for this.

This was very delicious! I was really proud of myself at how well this turned out. It was my first time making key lime pie. I will use just a little less than 1 tablespoon of zest next time, seems like the zest sometimes detracted from the lovely creaminess. I'm adding this to my favorites.

The recipe for me was good, but a little too rich. I adjusted the recipe a bit and now it's perfect for my taste! Everyone loves it and you still get a nice firm set. 

2 C sweetened condensed milk 
1 C sour cream
3/4 C Key lime juice
4 drops green food coloring

Doubling it makes for easy measuring...
For 2 pies I use 3 cans condensed milk and 1 tub of sour cream (16 oz).  

If you're buying a crust look for the larger 9" ones. The regular 8" size is a bit too small for this much filling.

Since visiting the FL Keys this past winter and tasting the best key lime pie ever, I have been on the hunt for a good key lime pie. This one hits the spot. I followed the recipe but only added a pinch of key lime zest instead of the recommended tablespoon. The limes I used provided enough tartness without that much zest, besides I prefer it a little sweeter and a little less tart. I served it to my church small group and they all loved it! So easy to make and delicious!!

I made this pie for a friends birthday party as a favor.  Allot of pressure as all of her friends where trying it in a restaurant gathering.  All I can say is WOW as fast as the pieces came from the kitchen folks where gobbling them up!

Stuck the the recipe step by step and nailed it!

Only thing I wish I would have done make my own graham cracker crust.  Other than that it was AWESOME!!!!

I absolutely love this recipe! I have used this recipe several times and those I share it with always rave. If I make this pie for a coconut lover, I sometimes toast coconut and add it to the crust, and sprinkle toasted coconut on top. Delicious!

My husband loved this, one of his favourites is key lime pie and this made the cut. It is quite tart, especially if you squeeze actual key limes for the juice. Easiest way to juice the small key limes is to use a garlic press. Very simple and quick that way.

We were recently in Key West, FL. While we were there, my son became addicted to key lime pie. After two days of him talking about wanting pie, I decided to make him one. I didn't realize how easy it could be! This recipe is fantastic and super easy. However, my son said it tastes even better than the Key West pie. I will definitely make this often! I didn't change a thing!

This recipe is excellent--didn't change a thing. We had key lime pie out last night and I was craving it today. Now we have a whole eight piece pie for two of us! I used the Graham Cracker Crust I and Whipped Cream recipe as accompaniment. This is a beautiful looking dessert, great to bring as a gift to a party.

I ALWASYS TWEAK MY RECIPES:Try fresh lemon juice, it works fabulously and is much easier than squeezing all those little limes, do not take the time to make your own sweetened condensed milk,  it is faster to go to thestore and buy it.

I love key lime pie, but mine turned out bitter both times I made it. I think it must be the zest. I used fresh pressed key lime juice, which wasn't very sour itself. Consistency is really nice and it couldn't be easier to make (using garlic press for the key limes and enlisting the help of my 11 year old daughter helped!) Not sure why it's not as great as the other reviewers have had. I'll make again but will omit zest next time in hopes of a less bitter pie.

Sickly sweet.  Since I used regular limes (that are common in Toronto, Canada) as an alternative, I rated this recipe a 3.  I rate my "perisan lime" pie a 1. I even used 1 extra lime for juice and extra zest.  The end result was still more sweet than tart.  The lime taste did not come through as much as I would of liked.  Even with the extra juice the pie still came out firm.  I would recommend that you taste the pie filling before you put it in the oven and alter to your taste buds.

I used all of the sweetened condensed milk in two cans (28 oz) so I increased the size of the pie by adding 1/4 C more lime juice and a little more sour cream.  I used regular fresh lime juice and zest.

I have made many key lime pies in my life, but this beats them all.  I have NO IDEA if this is authentic key lime pie, but I simply don't care!  It is creamy, tart, sweet and a simple, perfect dessert.  It will be my "go to" recipe from now on.

Best key lime pie ever! I had no key limes so I used lemons but it was delicious anyway. It is also good to add tree spoons of creamcheese If you like cheesecake. It gaves the pie a softer traste.

This was easy and pretty good. However, it was a bit lime-y for me, so next time I think I'll reduce the lime juice to half a cup.

(First time making a key lime pie ever) This was a super easy, and fairly quick recipe! Everyone loved it, and it was so sweet. I used 6 regular limes in place of the key limes, and used the zest from two of the limes, and I used two cans of sweetened condescend milk (14 oz). This pie had great flavor, and was very sweet. Great recipe, will make again.

I didn't change a thing.  I made this for a church gathering, and an old man said Key Lime pie hu?  He got a large piece, found a seat, and set about the task before him.  Some time later he came up to me and told me that he is always skeptical when someone says they brought a Key Lime pie.  He proceeded to tell me he was indeed an expert at Key Lime as it was his very favorite.  He said well.... you indeed brought a Key Lime pie with you, and it is one of the very best I have eaten.  I hope you bring that again some time.  So, take it for what it's worth.  He was no spring chicken, and claims he has spent years eatin pies which folks were claiming to be Key Lime.   Some are, and some ain't, but this one past his test! Enjoy! He did:)

This pie is a WINNER! We loved it. It's so easy to make and tastes like a gourmet pie. The only thing I added was a sour cream topping that I use for my cheese cakes. I just thought it might be a nice alternative to whipping cream and it was a hit! I used 1 cup sour cream and 3 tablespoons of sugar.

I'm not a terrible baker for one and I was so excited for this to turn out well given all the good reviews. The pie did not set at all! It was liquid even after baking and after refrigerating over night. So disappointed.

OMGosh, so yummy!!! I made this for Christmas eve, doubled the recipe, and made it in a 9 x 13 glass dish. It took me 59 key limes to make 3/4 cup of juice (they were ping pong ball sized limes). Someone said they only used about 6 limes, well I think they must have used regular lime. So for the double recipe part, I used lemon juice. I made the crust like someone else suggested (Keebler pecan sandies and butter). It was delish.

This pie is delicious!  I used about 20 key limes and almost 1 regular lime. To juice the key limes, I sliced off the top and bottoms of each lime, then used a small fork to get all the juice out.  This seemed to be the easiest way, since I was able to rub the inside of the lime against the fork. Don't forget to squeeze the little end peices for an extra few drops of that lime gold. I didn't see any mention if straining the juice, but it was an easy step to a creamy pie. I did grate about 4 key limes to get the zest. I don't know if it adds that much flavor, but it definitely makes for a pretty pie. Easy, not to sweet, not to tart.  It's definitely a keeper!

I had never made a key lime pie before, but it's my boyfriend's favorite, so I decided to make this recipe for his birthday. Extremely simple recipe with only five ingredients. The result was a creamy, tart, wonderful dessert! One of the best key lime pies I've ever had. I will definitely make this again and again.

Never disappoints! I get asked for this pie all the time. Ten large keylimes can make enough juice for 2 pies, from my experience. I always over buy.

Wonderful and so easy! I did bake it a little longer and it set up a little more firmly. It is tart, for sure, but I love that! Make sure you serve with a good whipped cream. I will make this again!

Amazing! I used 2 cans of 14oz fat free (still has regular sugar) condensed milk instead of regular and it was AMAZING.  It was even better the second day!  I'm a huge key lime snob and this recipe was so easy and tasted soooo good! Thank you for the excellent recipe!!!

The pie comes together so well and has a lovely texture, but I found 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk to be too much. The pie was so sweet my husband and I had to have it with strong coffee to cut the sweetness. Next time I will try a recipe that uses less sweetened condense milk.

This recipe was a hit at our house!  I used two cans of fat-free sweetened condensed milk, 3/4 cup key west lime juice from the grocery store, and skipped the grated lime.  I can't believe how simple this is, we will be making this quite often!

EXCELLENT!  VERY RICH!  I've made this pie on several occasions now - always to great success.  The last time I made them I made a cinnamon graham cracker crust and used reduced fat condensed milk (2 cans is plenty).  And, as we can't get key limes here I used Parisan limes.  I upped the amount of lime juice to 1 cup and the zest of three limes (in the mix and as garnish). When I make these the only complaints I get are that I'm bringing them in to the office.  The people here have no will power!

Delicious recipe! I didn't have key lines, so I used half Persian limes and half lemons, and the flavor was great. I made a homemade coconut graham cracker crust -- YUM!

This was so simple that I didn't believe it would be so good!  I liked not having to use any eggs.  The flavor was great.  I followed the recipe, but I did use regular limes (about 6) and two lemons.  I used lime zest as well.  It turned out perfect.  This is my new go to key lime pie recipe.

i wanted something easy and summery to bring to a labor day cookout yesterday.  i thought about key lime something because i had a bottle of nellie and joe's key lime juice from a failed key lime bar attempt.  when i saw this recipe's rating and how easy it was, i figured i'd give it a try.  the ingredients seemed too easy to be good, but my family is very forgiving of my baking fails - plus i had enough time to whip up something else if needed.  after reading reviews, i decided to go with low fat condensed milk and sour cream (used two 14oz cans of eagle brand low fat condensed milk and daisy low fat sour cream) and bought a premade graham cracker crust because i didn't want to waste time making a crust if it wasn't going to be a keeper recipe.

it's a keeper recipe.  i cooked it for about 14 minutes before i saw a few pinhole bubbles and, after giving it a little shake, it seemed to have set well.  i did not use any lime zest because i didn't want anything to disturb the smooth consistency of the pie.  i cooled it for about 40 minutes on top of the stove, then popped it in the fridge for about 5 hours.  i think it was set properly - we were able to cut it and serve it without too much oozing; i've never made a pie like this so i'm not exactly sure what i was looking for/expecting.  i served it with redi whip and it was a hit.  my brother who has never had key lime pie ate almost an entire piece and said it was good but a little tart for him lol.  definitely a keeper!

I have made 3 now, in 2 weeks. It just keeps disappearing!  The last time, I cheated and I bought lime juice instead if squeezing my own and it was still fantastic. I leave out the lime zest now because I don't think it adds any flavor, just decoration.  Followed the recipe exactly and I serve it with freshly made whipped cream.

I have a Key Lime tree that has more limes than I can use. Made two pies and they were two of the best Key Lime pies I've ever made. I'll turn to this recipe from now on. They were perfectly tart! I cut back on the sugar a little. The pies turned out tart, creamy and excellent! Thank you for sharing!

5 star plus! love making pies and lots of experience doing it but never a key lime pie...super easy & exceptionally yummy recipe.  Followed the recipe but reduced sweetened condensed to 2 (used bottled key lime juice) and it turned out perfect all the way around.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

So easy and so good. I garnished with whipped cream and thought it would be needed for added creaminess but the pie is perfectly creamy on its own. I will definitely make it again!

So many compliments when I make this pie! For the crust, I use the recipe on the Honey Maid graham cracker crumb box. Add in about 1/3 cup of sweetened shredded coconut to the crumbs for a more interesting version. You may have to add in a bit more melted butter depending on the moisture in the coconut. I used 2 cans of condensed milk and increased the lime juice from 3/4c to 1c. Just used good ol' SoCal limes from the neighbor's tree for the juice. I found it helpful to add the grated lime zest by hand, just before you pour the filling into the shell; then the zest won't hang up on your beaters. When serving, add some fresh raspberries and a bit of raspberry coulis to jazz it up!

This pie was really tasty. I didn't have sour cream and substituted Greek yogurt. the lime zest intensified the flavor, too.

Image made this pie 4 times now and the recipe is great. However, the lime juice does make a significant difference. I couldn't find key limes the first time I made it and even the regular limes were too expensive to justify it, so I just used regular lime juice (the Real Lemon brand) and it was perfect, not too tart, just the perfect amount of tartness. This last time I found actual Key West key lime juice at Publix and it was just too tart. I am sure if I only use 1/2 cup of the juice amount it would have been perfect. Just keep that in mind if you do not want it too tart.

Made this the first time for a crowd today. They loved it and so did I! The lime zest adds character and key limes--while a pain to juice--make a difference from past experience with other key lime pie recipes. I topped off what I could squeeze from fresh key limes with Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice from a bottle. It turned out great. But I had more filling than what a 9-inch pie pan needed so I quickly made another graham cracker crust and filled it too. Definitely on my keeper list!

This was my first key lime pie.  I took it to a cook out on the 4th of July, and it was a HIT! Let's just say, everyone was seriously moaning while eating it.  I'm saving this as one of my go-to recipes because of how easy it is to make and because it is heavenly!  I did make my own graham cracker crust (next time I think i'll even make the graham crackers from scratch) from a recipe I found on here as well.

I really did like this pie...only 1 thing I would change
Only do 2 cups condensed and 1 cup evaporated milk...its WAY too sweet as written in the recipe. Also, make your own crust and put a little lime zest in...its amazing :)

There is no exaggeration when I say this is one of the best recipies I've had. I had my doubts when I saw how simple it was but it was a huge hit with everybody. The one thing with the recipe is that I had to guess how long to chill it so I just let it in the fridge for 6-7 hours. But the texture and taste was perfect. This is the perfect key lime pie recipe!

The best thing about this pie is TWO things...one, it is egg-free and my 7-yr-old g'daughter is allergic to eggs among other things. She absolutely LOVED this pie. I used little individual premade graham cracker tart shells.  Another thing that is great is that it is NO-BAKE...in summer, a must.

Always a slam dunk. I make this with the pretzel crust from a margarita pie recipe. The salt balances the sweetness of this pie filling like you wouldn't believe.

I absolutely love this recipe, its so easy to make, tastes delicious!!! I make it just to have in my fridge. I used regular limes and a whole can of sweetened condensed milk and it taste's great. I did not use lime zest because its not my favorite.

It was good, but, I think I like the traditional version with egg yolks.  This was a bit too much like pudding for me.  If you love pudding - fine, but, I am not a pudding fan, so... not quite as tart as I would prefer either.

So easy and so delicious!!  I didn't have enough limes so I filled in with a little bit of lemon juice.  This is so yummy!  I accidentally bought a shortbread crust instead of a graham cracker crust but it worked out just fine. I put whipped cream all around the edges and in the center then sprinkled some more lime zest on top. Will certainly make this again.

I was impressed with this one! As a Southern girl I didn't have high expectations until I actually made it! My family loved it! Just bought more ingredients to make another one! Would be great if a miracle worker could figure out how to make sweetened condensed milk low sugar.....then I would make this one all summer!

It was hard to believe there were so many positive reviews for this recipe, until we tried it. WONDERFUL! Except for squeezing all he little limes, it was very easy to put together. We made our own crust, using another recipe. This definitely is a keeper.

I made this pie for a pie baking contest at my church this weekend. I had to make a homemade crust per the rules of the contest. I used premade graham cracker crumbs and just followed the recipe on the container. I also used about 24 key limes which measured exactly 3/4 of a cup. It was very easy to make, and I ended up winning the contest!  I was pretty excited because this is the first pie I've ever made!! I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this recipe today for a Memorial Day BBQ at my brothers house,"Big Hit". I followed recipe except I used Nellie & Joe's famous Key West Lime juice.I have used this brand for years, it is the best.I love addition of sour cream, kind of cuts sweetness and brings out flavors.This will be my go to recipe.

Super-easy and really good! I was also pleasantly surprised to find key lime juice in my little food store right up the street, which means ANYONE can make this. I made the pie a bunch of times, normally as a quick little something to bring to a summer party. Today I'm going to try using a mini-cupcake tin to make a bite-sized version. Thanks for posting!

This pie is fantastic and so easy! The only tough part is juicing all of those limes, but I used a garlic press to make it much faster. I also used a homemade graham cracker crust and fresh whipped cream. Even my mom, who is not a key lime pie fan, LOVED this pie. I will definitely be making it again. :)

This was a simple key lime pie and was the right texture but mine was barely not tart enough.  It is hard to count points off for that since the key limes are a produce item and vary so much in acidity and tartness.  That said, next time I will try it with all the same measurements except I will just use two cans of milk instead of three cups.  Thank you for the recipe.  We enjoyed it very much.

Fantastic key lime pie!  My husband wanted a key lime pie for his birthday, and I usually use a different recipe, but wanted to try something different.  This was just like the pie we get when we travel to Key West....it'll be my go-to recipe from here on out!

I'm not quite sure why this has a 1,700 5 star ratings. It was ok but it basically just tasted like sweetened condensed milk with lime flavoring. I would prefer something fresher.

Easy to make other than the limes take a while to squeeze. If you microwave the limes (for no more than a few seconds!) they are much easier to squeeze. Tastes delicious!

I liked this pie was very good.  I am a little confused about the amount of cream. The recipe calls for three cups so I measured a 14 oz can at one cup.  Some are saying two cans make three cups. Maybe something wrong with my Anchor measuring cup?  I had a bag of these little buggers but could not hold onto them. Two thirds done with bag and one fourth cup of juice. Went to town and bought some Key lime juice.

I love this receipt!  I made it for Easter, and now I'm about to make it again for a Cinco de Mayo party. I followed the receipt but doubled it for two pies.  That made enough filling for an extra pie. Also I followed the advice of others and cooked it ten minutes and they turned out perfect. If I can do this anyone can.

I made this pie for Easter dessert because key lime pie is my mom and my boyfriend's favorite.  It was very easy.. I used bottled lime juice.  It didn't look ready at 8 minutes so I let it bake for about 12 minutes and then I saw the tiny bubbles.  I put it in the fridge overnight and served it today.  (Easter Sunday)  Everyone loved it and my boyfriend said it was restaurant quality.  Thank you.  I will make this again.

Wow! Just, wow! This pie was amazing. It was also incredibly easy to make. I took the rest home from Easter dinner tonight and can't wait to have another piece. I loved it! Thank you so much for a great recipe. My husband, who doesn't even like Keylime pie, love this. I will be making it again and I didn't change a thing.

"3 cups," (per the recipe) of condensed milk is 2+ cans--which leaves you the partial 3rd can to store somehow, somewhere, for some reason, or, more probably, to let spoil and throw away...the recipe works just fine using only 2 cans...i love stuff that comes out even...other than that, everything was great...rave reviews from the audience...

Probably the best key lime pie I will ever taste! Strong lime flavor, but not overwhelming. My dad is very picky about his key lime pies, yet he couldn't help having seconds of this one! I definitely recommend this :)

I really love the texture of this pie, very smooth and creamy.  Mine took a little bit longer to bake, about 10 mins, probably because I used a cake tin instead of a pie plate (couldn't find it).  My only real problem with this pie was it was so alarmingly sweet I added lemon juice and even some salt to try and tone it down, which didn't help as we could only eat a very small slice before it became too much.

Key Lime pie is my favorite! This recipe tops any that I have had and is by far soo.. simple.  I baked it for work for someones birthday and it was a huge hit.  I made and almond crust because co-workers are gluten intolerant. (2 cups of almond meal, 4Tbls. melted butter, and 4Tbls confectioners sugar. Bake at 350 8-10 mins.) Everyone raved and we had it again 2 days later for the next birthday!

Excellent! Big hit for people who like key lime. It definitely only need two cans of sweetened condensed milk. Never saw the bubbles, so baked for 10 min. per other reviewers suggestions.

I have made this recipe before to make lemon meringue pie but the recipe I used is one can sweetened condensed milk and a half of a cup of lemon juice ,, the only sugar I used was a quarter cup in the meringue ... anyway this is a very good recipe and I have tried it with lime but only using a half of a cup of the juice and it always turns out well..

Finally made this! I really can't ad anything to these already glowing reviews, this pie was great. For ease and because I had read good things about Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice on Amazon and found some at Wal-Mart, I used that. I did make my own graham cracker crust (Graham Cracker Crust I). 10 stars!!

I had to go back and look twice when i realized there were no egg yolks in this recipe. I was doubtful that it would set up and really a bit concerned that it wouldn't taste just right but because it was quick and easy, thought "What the heck!"
All I can say is this is by far the best key lime pie I have ever made. 
I did use regular limes instead of key lime, it made it a hair less tart but that's fine with me.
Am making another this afternoon for dinner guests tomorrow. looking forward to seeing how much it is enjoyed. 
Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect.  I make a crust by crushing up graham crackers then mixing it with some melted butter(just google graham cracker crust recipe). Then follow this recipe as directed and it turns out perfect(I have made this twice and about to make it again tonight) I do find the longer you let the pie chill the better it is.

This recipe is so wonderful, my husband and I can polish off a whole pie in a day and a half!  I follow the recipe almost exactly, the exception being I only use 2 cans (about 2 cups) of sweetened condensed milk.  I don't think I would like it with all three cups, it would be way to sweet I think. With two cups it is the PERFECT balance of sweet and tart for us, and fills the pie crust perfectly.  I top it with whipped cream I make with 3 TBS of powdered sugar and grate lime zest over it to make it pretty. So happy I found this recipe!  One last little hint- you can make it with any type of lime and I find it's delicious either way ;) I may try it with lemon juice just to experiment next time.

Made this as stated and it was so yummy!!! The second time I used bottled lime juice and no lime zest. I almost liked it better. It is a bit less tart. Also, add ingredients slowly so they incorporate. Total keeper!!

The tastiest key lime pie I have ever made, and also the easiest pie ever! (as long as you have a juicer and not trying to get the juice out of key limes by hand). This takes between 25-30 key limes depending on their juiciness.

The taste is amazing--perfect combo between tart and sweet. And it's so fast and easy to make, especially if you just buy a good pre-made graham cracker crust. My only suggestion is to use just 2 cans of sweet condensed milk. 3 cups isn't necessary, and then you have too much leftover filling to fit in the crust.

Absolutely the best Key Lime Pie... hands down!  My daughter & I made this along with Allrecipes.com Graham Cracker Crust I, by Carol, and Easy Whipped  Cream, by Thymekeeper.
We used approx. 30 Key Limes to get 3/4 C. juice.   The best way to juice the Key Limes is to cut them in half then press the juice out using a garlic press... I learned this tip from reviewer, ljm4mr.  It took 2 1/2 (14oz.) cans of condensed milk = 3 C.  We garnished the pie with left over graham cracker crumbs and lime slices, and served it with a few fresh raspberries on the side which were a very nice compliment to the pie.
This recipe is so easy and it is so delicious that I am thinking about asking my girlfriend if I can sell it in her restaurant. :-)  ...And this is coming from a girl who hates to cook!

The best--I made this with only 8 large limes and I had enough juice, I also did not add the grated lime and it turned out great--nut I had to bake mine for about 20 minutes at 350 because I used a thick ceramic pie pan

Made this pie 3 times and it's always a hit.  I wasn't a cream pie fan however this is my new favourite pie.  I've cooked it for 10 min as I don't usually see the pinhole bubbles described above, and it turns out fine.

Tried this easy recipe for my very fussy daughter in law and it was a resounding smash.. No Key Limes, but regular limes which I froze to be able to grate the zest. Then zapped the frozen limes in micro to juice…added the pulp to the mixture, but one secret I think was to let the grated rind mix in with the lime juice. Can hardly wait to use real Key Limes.  Highly, highly recommend this dessert..so easy  Oh…yes, two cans of sweetened condensed milk add up to three cups. Topped it with whipped cream and strawberries.

Very quick and easy recipe -- followed it exactly. The odd taste some are reporting is from the sour cream. At first it's an odd taste and not exactly what you'd expect from a key lime pie. The flavor grew on me, however I would be hesitant to use this recipe on someone outside of the home as they might find it a less pleasant surprise.

This is the BEST Key Lime Pie ever. I use bottled key lime juice (Nellie & Joes) and 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk (makes a deep pie). We like it frozen, so I place in the freezer once it cools. Awesome dessert!

I made mine with lemons! Had to use twice as much juice to get it tart enough but it turned out great! I also used nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It had to cook twice as long as the recipe suggested. But turned sour great!

I didn't change a thing to this recipe, and it was awesome! Real key lime pie taste! I really prefer key lime cheesecake, but that' just my personal preference. I made this for my father in law, and he said it was THE BEST key lime pie he's ever had, even better than restaurant pies.

Brought this to a Super Bowl party and everyone LOVED it. It was very flavorful and creamy.
I usually use the recipe on the key lime bottle, but thought I'd try something different. Glad I did!!

Hello. I made this wonderful pie last night. I used one and ¾ cans of the SCM and added a little more sour cream to make up for it so it wouldn’t be too sweet as other reviewers have mentioned. My boyfriend said it probably is the best key lime pie he has ever had! Thank you for a great recipe!

Only problem with this pie is I had to eat the entire thing in two sittings .....addictive ..... 
Second round I used 1 can condensed milk, doubled the lime and sour cream (I like it tart, as written I found it way too sweet)and with the adjustment I ate it in 1 sitting ....

I made this yesterday from a Recipe card that came in a pot holder gift set. Anyways I was looking on allrecipes to see how it compared and the same recipe is there verbatim . It's so good and easy you have to try it!!!  
like some of the reviewers said I used 2 14 oz cans of sweetened condensed milk-which is about 2 1/2 cups measured out (not over 3 cups like it should be) but my pie turned out perfect. I also used 3/4 cup key-west lime juice instead of key limes. it was great!!! I baked mine for about 10-11 min and never saw the bubbles it was talking about but took it out and it set up really nicely we were able to dig into it after dinner even though I made it just before!!!

My picky extended family loves this pie.  It is pretty sweet, but I suppose its supposed to be.  To decorate I made some whipped cream and poured it into a baggie and cut the tip so that I could make a design around the sliced limes that I arranged on top.  A big hit.

Great texture. Great color. Good flavor, except the 3 cups sweetened condensed milk made the pie really too sweet. I actually had to let it all go because it was just too sugary. I did like this recipe though, and next time I'll use 1 cup sweetened condensed milk and 2 cups unsweetened condensed milk.

This pie was a real hit with my friends and family!! My son wanted me to make this for his 21st birthday. Being Australian I had never tried one before much less made one so I went to this site in search of the best recipe I could find and this one seemed a good bet! I had to change the crust as I am a coeliac. I made up the crust with 1 x175g packet of gluten free shortbread biscuits - processed to crumbs, 1 x 250g almond meal and 1 egg to bind. I pricked it with a fork and blind baked it for 8 mins. Then just made the filling and baked it as per the recipe with one small edition of a shot of good white rum because that's what my son wanted and a little extra juice and zest as we don't get Key Limes here. No one at the party had tried it before but everyone loved it and asked for a copy of the recipe. Thanks Ann - It's a WINNER!!!!

This key lime pie smelled like the destin diaper rash cream. The consistency was nice, but I couldn't get past the smell. I even made homemade crust and homemade whipped cream to top it with. I was really let down. My dad was the only one who would even touch it. I did check that all of my ingredients weren't expired.

My youngest son has been requesting a key lime pie, so I came here to look for one. I made this for New Year's Eve and it was fabulous. I thawed a small tub of cool whip and spread a layer on top of the cooled pie before serving. I also have a confession...I did not have any key limes or key lime juice, so I just used the bottled lime juice (ReaLime) that I had on hand and it worked just as well. And actually, if anything, the pie was a little less bitter than with the key lime juice, which I prefer but my son wants me make it with actual key limes to compare. Great recipe!

First try = Thumbs up! Used key limes from my back yard which made it taste even better. I'm going to try a variation using Meyer lemons, also from back yard.

Great recipe and I don't like Key Lime Pie! 
To my nature I added the following to the recipe & had no complaints.....only repeat co-workers asking for another slice:
Lime flavored Rum...2-3oz
Whipped Cream Vodka...just shy of 1oz
3 cans of sweetened condensed milk and Sour cream about 3/4 cup (to make up for the added liquid)! 
I also added about 3oz of the Whipped Cream Vodka and some grated lime zest (about 2 limes worth)  to some Cool Whip for a very decidant whipped cream topping but only in the center of the pie not over the whole thing. 
Super easy, super delicious thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

The flavor was okay, but this is a very heavy pie - literally. Also, the texture is a bit off-putting; firm to the point of being rubbery. My daughter said, "Mom, this pie reminds me of play dough," and my husband said, "That's it! I knew this pie reminded me of something!" If you're looking for a light, summery pie, keep looking.

This is one of my favorite pies of all time. It is literally perfect. Perfect tartness, perfect sweetness, perfect lime-y taste. I put homemade whipped cream on top and it's divine. It's also super easy to make which is nice.

Amazing!! Made it for Xmas 2013 and it was a hit! I used 2 cans of condensed milk like others suggested and all the listed ingredients. I defrosted a container of cool whip and used about 1/4 of it just enough to cover the pie. Hardest part was squeezing the limes on my garlic press but it was soo worth it when I tasted it! The fresh lime flavor really comes through. This is our new favorite pie, pumpkin cheesecake move over! I plan to use this recipe again but maybe with a version of condensed milk made of coconut milk to make it somewhat healthier. Love it!

This pie was not only far too bitter, but it didn't even resemble the more custard-like key lime pies that I often make. I tried this one because it looked easy, but the mixture is far too thick and bitter. In order to get any sweetness out of it, you need to add at least a cup of sugar. I made this for Christmas, and other than sampling it, no one ate it.

Easy & fantastic! Made my own graham cracker crust using the boxed crumbs. All my guests raved about it and wanted the recipe. Note -- 3 cups of condensed milk is slightly less than 3 cans. Don't make the mistake of buying only two and then driving back to the grocery store in the middle of your project. ;) Took about twice as long to bake in my electric oven.

I've made this pie twice now and they are consistently simple to make, but impress those trying it! 20 limes is perfect. So is the 2 cans of condensed milk. Grate some lime zest over the top of the pie before baking to add some color. Will be making this one over and over again.

This is the easiest, and best key lime recipe I have found. I live in Florida, so this is a popular dessert. The texture is perfect. Creamy, but firm enough to slice up nicely. This will be my go-to key lime pie recipe. Thanks for sharing!

The recipe is too sweet and not enough sour.  The pie set up nicely though. I think if I made this again I would use lime concentrate to make it.

This is the best tasting filling I've ever tried. Have tried several other recipes but this one is the winner for me. The sour cream adds a fluffiness and it's nice and limey just as prepared.  I only had 1 lime so I probably didn't have as much zest as it called for but it was still very good.

This Recipe is the absolute most fantastic Key Lime Pie unbaked I have ever tasted. It's quite simple and easy to make.  You can also switch the crust up if you'd prefer. If you're a chocolate lover try using a Chocolate Graham Cracker Crust it will delight your palate.  I have made this pie on several occasions and is always a huge hit.

Excellent, except that the original Key Lime Pie was made with a pie crust, not graham crackers, and no sour cream. Good both ways but I like the pie crust version.

I have never made keylime...or really any pie before and this was awesome easy and delicious. I used the premade baby pie crusts for this.  It made about 12. 

It had the awesome tartness that you dont get from store bought. My one issue was that I never saw tiny bubbles...probly from my tiny crusts. And I ended up baking for about 12 minutes total. Turned out perfect. Thankyou!!
I must be a bad juicer because I used about 30 keylimes(a bag was like 1.50).

This was delicious!! (make it the day before to allow the flavors to meld, and definitely make a homemade graham cracker crust!

I got the little pinhole/bubbles about 7 to 8 minutes into baking.

I also only needed one bag of key limes rather than two. One bag of key limes gave me 1.5 cups of juice. (I rolled the limes before squeezing them to soften them up.)

I always get rave reviews about this pie.  I make it in individual ceramic pie pans, rather than one big pie.  Everyone always asks me for the recipe and to bring it to the next get together.

Initial reaction:  This is a little bitter.  I don't know if it was the limes or what.  From 28 key limes (one bag) I got just shy of 3/4 cup of juice.  I decided not to supplement with bottled, as I did not want to sully the flavor.  I zested perhaps 8 limes before cutting and squeezing to get a little over a tablespoon of zest.

I will update when we have more tomorrow and it is fully chilled, not just slightly cool.  We may add ice cream as well.

Update:  Definitely let this sit overnight!  The lime is stronger, there isn't that weird bitter taste, and being fully chilled really helps.  Also, I think I will pick up an actual citrus zester, instead of using my box grater, to avoid getting pith with my zest.

This recipe is fantastic! My only modification was a chocolate crust (using chocolate wafer cookies). The chocolate was a great contrast with the tart key lime- Mmmmm!

I made this pie and used the lighter ingredients except for the sweetened condensed milk. Also I toasted sweetened coconut flakes and sprinkled it on top of the cool whip on the pie. It was a HIT!!! I took the rest of the pie to the gym to share among those who work at the gym and the three of them were fighting over the last piece. Definitely, will be making it again.

It's easy to make, requires only a few ingredients, and tastes great! All around good recipe. I used a Keebler pre-made graham crust and Nellie and Joe's bottled key lime juice to save time. I also don't like overly sweet desserts and tasted the mixture before pouring it into my crust, and here's what I changed to make it more palatable for me. I only used 1 and a half can of the sweetened condensed milk and substituted the rest with coconut milk (you can use coconut cream as well) and used a little extra sour cream. I also added the zest of one regular lime and in a small ramekin, I made a similar mixture with a few drops of peppermint extract, as I thought a creamy, coconutty, tart, and a zing of refreshing mint would make it more interesting. I baked the pie for approximately 15 minutes, as the pinhole bubbles are kinda hard to see, but it was fine. I let it rest in the oven for a bit, then let it cool off on the counter before storing it in the fridge to chill. My boyfriend said the smaller "sample/experiment" key lime pie tasted kinda like a peppermint patty. I thought it was good but if you try this, be careful to not add too much mint as it will take away from the creamy/tartness of the actual pie. The coconut milk was a nice variation if you're looking to try something slightly different.

The pie came out great, but it turned out to be too sweet for me.  I would definitely make this again, but I think next time I'll do it as tarts with about half as much filling.

All I can say is, "WOW!"  I live in Florida, have been making Key Lime Pie all my life using the "traditional" recipe: key lime juice, 1 can of condensed milk, and 3 egg yolks.  It is a good, simple recipe, but the pie crust is only 2/3 filled, and I'm left with 3 egg whites that I am usually guilted into turning into a meringue topping. This recipe is, well, SUPERIOR! The flavor is delightful, it sets up quickly, and the pie shell is filled almost to overflowing! I used 2 cans of condensed milk and cooked for about 10 minutes.  This will be the recipe I use from now on.  THANK YOU!

I made this last night, and we ate some today.  Wow, is it great!  Just when you think it might be too sweet, you get a little of the lime zest, and a burst of tartness.  A little homemade whipped cream really tops it off.  Squeezing all the limes is a bit of a pain, but the final product is well worth it.

I have tried a lot of key lime pie recipies over the years and this was by far my favorite. Everyone LOVED it.  I am not a big fan of actual key limes so I used regular limes. As suggested by several reviewers, I also stuck to 2 cans of sweet and condensed milk rather than 3 cans.  I can't wait to make this pie again!

This pie was amazing and extremely easy. It was light and creamy and so very delicious. I did end up baking it several minutes longer than the recipe called for, as 8-10 minutes just wasn't long enough for bubbles to form... It probably took more like 15-20 minutes for mine to finish. 

Will definitely be making this again.

I made this with Graham Cracker Crust I (cinnamon omitted) from this site, and it turned out great. I haven't had Key Lime Pie in years, but this is exactly what I remember it tasting like. I used a pre-packed bag of key limes, so I didn't count them. I did use the garlic press trick - works great. I had let the limes sit in my fridge longer than I should have, and they were turning brown, so I only got about 1/2 tbsp of zest off them. I don't think I would use the full tbsp next time, though, anyways - I find the flavor to be exactly strong enough as it is. I also used two cans of sweetened condensed milk. Baked it for about 9 minutes. It set up very nicely, and hasn't deteriorated at all after sitting in the fridge uncovered overnight. I think for a crowd I would try making it in bars - it seems quite firm enough for that. All in all, great recipe.

I've made this pie time and again for my husband.  It is definitely his favorite.  It turns out well every time.  We've also tried the Emeril's key lime, which is good and a little less sweet, but tricky to make and can sometimes fail for unexplained reasons.  I also suggest a spoonful of bourbon whip cream to top it off.  It makes the perfect compliment to cut the sweetness.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Easy to make and turns out perfect every time.  I will say, I ususally have to bake mine for closer to 14 minutes to get the bubbles, but it has never burned or ruined the flavor.

Great recipe! Just use two cans of sweetened condensed milk and the zest of one lime, no need to measure. Very easy to make with bottled key lime juice. I do find that it needs to bake 10 or 12 minutes and I never seem to get the little bubbles. Have made this twice for my dad...his favorite...always comes out great! I think the sour cream is the secret ingredient that adds a great creamy tanginess.

Love this recipe! Perfect pie that my family devoured! However, I will not use the lime zest next time I make it (tonight actually). I admit I don't have a "real" zester and just used my grater. My family just didn't like the texture in the pie, but other than that it was perfect. I also used bottled key lime juice as our grocery store did not have any key limes.

This is a keeper! Easy, delicious!!!! I used plain Greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream. My husband said it was better than any KLP he had on his travels to S. Carolina on business.

This recipe was ridiculously easy and delicious. I made this with a pretzel crust instead of graham cracker crust because I thought the combination of the saltiness of the pretzels and the pie would pair well with the margaritas we were having. The pie was a big hit. I would definitely make this again.

Fabulous! I lost my grandma's key lime pie recipe, but this is pretty close to how her's tasted. I topped mine with a fresh, homemade raspberry sauce and whipped cream. YUM!!

Just made this for my hubby....Key lime pie is his fav. He said this was perfect...just right...didn't need to change anything. I followed the recipe, but omitted the zest...didn't have any. Used key lime juice from a bottle and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. I read some reviews that said this tasted like eagle brand milk and I assure you, it does not...something must have went wrong with theirs. It tastes...well...like any key lime pie you've eaten before. Very good and easy to make!!!

I was unable to locate key limes in the time I needed but I did use bottled key lime juice and grated a regular lime for the lime zest. It worked really well! The pie was delicious and there was very little prep work. There was no need for juicing and it had a fantastic flavor! Highly recommend this recipe. I was always scared to make key lime pie but this recipe made it so easy!

Very good pie.  I've made this two times, once with the zest and once without the zest and it turns out good either way.  I always end up having a portion of a can of condensed milk left over so next time I'll cut back on the condensed milk just enough for 2 cans and cut back a little of the juice to balance out with the condensed milk.  I love that it's so easy to make.

I was hesitant to make this because I wanted to use fresh key limes, but didn't want the work entailed with trying to squeeze the juice from the oh so small key limes, until my husband suggested I use a garlic press.  I cut the key limes in half and then squeezed them using the garlic press and...presto! Done in a flash!  The pie was delicious and the recipe has been added to my recipe box.

Best Key Lime Pie EVER! I didn't even use key limes (I know- the horror!) and it turned out better than any key lime pie I have ever had. I will soon be making it with actual key limes to see how much better it will be. I can't wait!

I made this yesterday. Limes are small here so it really needed about 40 limes since I doubled the recipe. Also, I only used 2.5 cups of condensed milk and I thought it was plenty sweet and it firmed up in oven and the refrigerator just fine.

If I were to make it next time, I would go even lower on the sweetened condensed milk to 2 cups and I bet it will be plenty sweet and still hold together.

Finally, I used the gluten free graham crackers for a crust and it was fabulous.

Wow! This was absolutely fabulous!  Just the right combination of sweet, tart, and creamy.  Super easy to make, too.  I'd give this 10 stars, if I could,, and am tossing all other key lime pie recipes, as there is absolutely no way to beat this.  It was quick and easy to make because I used bottled Key Lime juice and two cans of store-brand sweetened condensed milk.  (Here in the Pacific NW, I found the key lime juice at New Seasons Market).  The only thing I did differently, was to make my own "graham cracker crust", using the recipe submitted to this site by Carole.

my boyfriend gave this a 9 out of 10.  It was really good.  The texture was perfect in what I consider to be a key lime pie.  The taste was super tart, so i had to make whipped cream to go with it.  The pie itself is super rich.

I used 2 cans of sweetend condensed milk (was a little over 2.5 cups), and a little under 3/4 cup fresh squeezed key limes (prepackaged bag of 16). Same amt of sour cream. Came out great. Just enough filling. Didn't care for the lime zest. Fresh berries and whipped cream on top. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Easy to make and yummy enough, though the consistency seems a bit off, it needed to be more firm. 
I kept the pie in the oven for 8 minutes but didn't see any tiny pinhole bubbles. Kept it in for an additional 2 minutes but was afraid to keep it in any longer than that. Not sure if the firmness issue was because I needed to bake it a little more. Other than the additional 2 minutes in the oven, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was a great hit at our Sunday dinner. Simple yet delicious! We added green and blue food coloring to the pie and whipped cream to make it Earth Day themed. It turned out perfect!

This is now our #1 Key Lime Pie recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is the best Key Lime Pie I have ever made and one of the easiest.  I followed the recipe with the exception of squeezing the limes.  Instead I used Mott's "RealLime" juice.  I did buy one lime so I could get the zest and used a couple of slices for decoration with real whipping cream.  Another use for this recipe is for parfaits.  Just make the filling in a pie pan without the crust and bake as normal.  When the filling is cooled, layer in glasses with graham cracker crumbs, whipping cream and filling.  I took them to a potluck in clear plastic cups and they were the hit of the party!

Does this pie really need another review?!! I was so easy, so fast to whip together with ingredients that I almost always have on hand...and absolutely delicious! I used persian limes because I had a whole bag but next time (which will be soon! I might even have a spring dinner party just so I have an excuse to make this pie) I'll use key limes. Even making my own graham crust, I think this only took about 1/2 hour to throw together on Easter Sunday morning; chilled all day in the fridge and it was the perfect light and fresh dessert for a ham dinner. Everyone loved it. Thanks!

Made exactly as recipe stated, cooked for about 12 minutes rather than 8.  Wished it was more tart, next time I'll try 1 cup of lime juice.

This is a good recipe. Fast and probably a healthier version since there are no eggs.  The next time, I am going to make a shortbread crust and include toasted pecan pieces as this will add a little more crunch. The shortbread crust is a personal choice.

This is an amazing pie! I was able to make the filling non-fat and it still was outstanding. Just use non-fat sweetened condensed milk and either non-fat sour cream or nonfat vanilla yogurt. Tried it both ways and couldn't tell the difference. Now I have to find a nonfat crust and it will be perfect! So yummy!

I believe this is one of the best key lime pie recipes I've found!  I didn't realize how good this pie could turn out with the absence of eggs, but it did.  I made my own graham cracker crust, used two cans of sweetened condensed milk as others have posted, and substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Since I do not own a citrus juicer, I just bought organic lime juice in the bottle.  I also added four True Lime packets as I like a very tart pie (personal preference).  I would say the most time consuming part in my opinion is making the graham cracker crust.  But after preparing the crust (I let it sit in the refrigerator an hour before filling), the rest of the ingredients come together in no time at all.  The cook time of 8 minutes is probably about right even though I let it sit in the oven for 10 minutes.  After chilling, I decorate it with a homemade whipped cream border and enjoy.  Thank you for sharing!

Others didn't like the taste very much but I thought it was okay. I personally think a little more key lime juice and less sour cream would have been good, because I couldn't taste the lime as much as I hoped to. Also, this recipe yields more of a pudding-like pie than others.

Can I give this more than five stars!?!? I'm used to making the more complex key lime recipe....wow I felt guilty taking this to a party it was so easy...I made two in one week and all was gobbled up...I used whipped cream to garnish...only disappointment was the store bought crust...home made would have been the buttery difference I craved. Will make this often!

I followed the filling recipe (using Joe & Nellie's bottled KL juice) but for adding 1 T regular lime juice from the lime I used for the zest, & low fat sour cream. For the crust I chose to use 'Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers' (available too expensively from Amazon...in many large supermarkets)--crushed in food processor w/, 1/2 t. cinnamon, 3 T. sugar & 6 T. melted butter pressed into 8" springform pan, partly up the side. Save some crumbs to sprinkle on top of the whipped cream (I used real) used to 'frost' the pie. I see that Oreo crusts are available in the store, but I prefer homemade. Excellent recipe. I don't know if it would work, but I'm thinking about folding egg whites into the filling to make it lighter and fluffier next time. Not sure how to adjust baking time with that change, though.

This was SOOO easy!  The only change I made was instead of 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk, I used 2 - 300 ml cans and it was perfect.  I actually had a little too much filling for the crust.  Also, you don't typically find key limes in our grocery stores but four regular sized limes gave me the exact amount of juice that I needed.  But this recipe is a dream!  I'm not an experienced pie maker by any stretch, but you'd never know it by the way this turned out!  Highly, highly recommended recipe!!

I was a little skeptical trying this recipe, noting that it had sour cream in the recipe. I was very close to going the egg whites route to make a more realistic key lime pie, but I am very glad that I did not! Being a Florida native for my entire life to date, this is about as good as it gets and everyone in my family whole-heartidly agreed! I would recommend this recipe for everyone due to its simplicity and amazing taste.

This recipe has all the taste but it's not quite right yet. I like the idea of using sour cream and ommitting the egg yolks because you don't get that eggy residue taste in your mouth.  The lime becomes the real star where flavor is concerned.

Though I tried to follow the directions exactly as written, the end result is that the filling didn't set up right.  I ended up making an executive decision to continue baking it in the oven more than twice as long than the recipe suggested because 5-8 minutes was just a joke.  I now wish I would have baked it for another 10 minutes as I wonder if that would have resulted in a firmer consistency.  I will probably try that in the next go.

Does anyone have a suggestion for how this recipe - using just fresh lime juice, condensed milk and sour cream can result in a pie fillign that is not goey or runny?  

PS - I got 3/4 cup of lime juice from exactly 6 limes.  That was a nice surprise!

I made this for our family's Christmas gathering (sometimes we like to be untraditional!) and it was a huge hit.  I tried 2 grocery stores but did not find any key limes, so I ended up using regular limes and reduced-fat sweetened condensed milk.  I also made my own graham cracker crust.  This was really very good and I'm sure I'll make it again.

This pie is wonderful! My family and coworkers have all told me it's the best key lime pie they have had.

Condensed milk comes in 14 oz cans. 2 cans = 28 oz. Recipe calls for 3 cups. 1 cup = 8 oz; 3 cups = 24 oz. The four extra ounces are fine in this recipe. Just pour in the two cans and it will turn out great. Don't worry if you have key limes or not. The biggest difference between them and just a regular lime is size. Normal limes are much easier to juice and zest. The flavor difference between the two types of limes is not much. They are limes, they will all be very acidic and limey! You will, however, notice a difference if you decide to use pre-bottled lime juice over freshly squeezed lime juice!

I have never made a key lime recipe with sour cream and without eggs. I have been missing out all these years! I made this recipe twice in one week! Everyone loved it! This will be my go to Key lime recipe. It is very balanced, creamy, and a decadent recipe! Thanks to the other reviews for the news about using 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk! I made my own crust and added a little salt. I think this would be good with crust made of graham and pretzel crumbs. Many people asked for the recipe!

On my many trips to the Florida Keys I have tried key lime pies at almost every meal.  This one tops them all.  Add more zest to make it best!  Home made graham cracker crust can't be beat and I make it extra thick and with  extra butter.  Yummy!

This is a really good pie!  I've had many key lime pies that were just so-so.  I was able to find the little key limes in my regular grocery store but wasn't looking forward to squeezing them.  Luckily, my husband found the key lime juice at Smart and Final (of all places!). I didn't have quite enough and still had to juice about 8 little limes.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe exactly.  So incredibly easily!  I wasn't sure whether to add the zest, but I did.  Added a nice subtle zing and homemade feeling.  Made it for Thanksgiving and people who don't normally like pies or anything sweet, loved this pie!  I plan on making it again and again.  Will be my go to pie.  Next time I might try making my own graham cracker crust, but the store bought was a big hit too.  I used 2 cans condensed milk like the other reviewers said and it was perfect.  Had exactly enough for a nicely filled, full 9 in regular pie.  Added whipped cream and the lime decorations before serving, and it looked so pretty and professional.  It was almost impossible to see the pinholes at 6-8 min, so cooked for 10 and it was perfect.  I could see the pinholes when I took it out (incredibly hard to see and so small, that I say just cook 10 min and be done).  Set perfectly, no problems.  Giving it 5 stars for being so tasty and so EASY.

I'm not sure if it was because I used regular limes instead of key limes, but this key lime pie was much too sweet for me! I like a fair balance between sweet and tart, and this did not do it for me. I ended up adding a lot more lime juice than the recipe called for, which made it somewhat runny as well. It still turned out to be quite good despite the strange texture; however, next time I will try using key limes instead.

To juice the limes; I suggest putting the in cold water for about half an hour then roll the on a flat surface with the palm of the hand. I used only 7 limes this way.

I reduced the lime juice to 1/2 C like other reviewers said, and I wish I hadn't bc it came out too sweet. Next time I will try somewhere between 1/2 & 3/4 cups of juice. I also used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and that was plenty (any more & it would have needed a deep dish pie crust).

My husband made this exactly as written, except using 2 cans milk as most reviewers suggested (3 would have overflowed 9" pie) - and he really liked it. I didn't (thus 4 stars) I don't like condensed milk, so I made the one Arias modified in her 10/25/11 review with the cream cheese, sour cream, less milk.  I LOVED IT - THANKS ARIAS!  So both of us ended up very happy with our pies.

Very thick, rich texture. Whatever you do (I still cannot believe I did this), MAKE CERTAIN YOUR BOTTLED KEY LIME JUICE IS NOT SWEETENED. And make sure it's key lime juice AT ALL! Apparently companies can market sweetened, regular lime juice from concentrate as "key lime juice". SHAME! Be "stingy" with those servings to guests--they come back if they want some more. Serve a sliver with a generous dollop of a chic yellow-green hued whipped cream and some zest or brightly-colored sugar crystals. Boom! Done!

I did this one in school, and it turned out perfect. This is basically everything a key lime pie should be. Just make sure to let it be chilled over night before you serve. It makes it so much better when you do. I hope everyone else enjoyed it as much as our customers did.

This is my first attempt at key lime pie and I can't believe how easy it was!  I used 2.5 cans of sweetened condensed milk (3 cups), low fat sour cream, and nellie and joe's key west lime juice from my local grocery store.  I let it set for about 2.5 hrs and it was cool, but 3-4 hrs. would have been better.  I will definitely be making this many more times!

this pie was very easy and I did exactly what it said ..I even used 2 and a half cans of condensed milk = 3cups (3 cans does not = 3 cups)..I did notice that after 15mins it still was not bubbling but I took it out as it was stiff,not jiggly .. yummy ..cant wait to try it tomorrow..!  I to found that a lemon squeezer worked good enough...but will try the garlic press next time..!!

This recipe is fantastic!  I used it for this fun little pie palooza competition, and what do you know?  It won!  I made the graham cracker crust from scratch, and then when I put it in the oven, it actually took a little over 10 minutes for the bubbles to actually burst, but I'm glad I kept it in that long, because it kept it from getting all runny. And the zest I added on top for a garnish made it really pretty.  So delicious!  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.

Search no further for a Key Lime pie recipe - I've been baking for years and used to make this pie using eggs for the custard.  I will never go that route again.  This is the perfect recipe.  I make my own crust with either graham crackers or vanilla wafer cookies.  Sometimes I put the grated lime zest in, sometimes I leave it out and to be honest, I do not notice any difference.  I use two cans of sweetened condensed milk and find I have to bake the pie for 30 minutes - it could be because I am using a glass pie pan.  I watch it at 5 minutes intervals.  This pie is delicious - very easy to make and is an absolute crowd pleaser.  One more thing...I use plain old limes - in my area there are no key limes.

I've never had key lime pie before so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  This pie is very easy to make (except squeezing all those tiny limes but no big deal) and very quick.  However I'm just not sure I love the combination of creamy and tart. It was just a little odd. But we all ate it and enjoyed it.

EXCELLENT!  My first time making key lime pie and it was delicious!  Topped with homemade whipped cream - pie was light, not too tart, a great summer dessert!
I did substitute plain greek yogurt for the sour cream.
Also - I used cuban limes (what the grocery store had) and it took 4 to get the 3/4 cup of juice.

Awesome!!!!!!! This pie is delicious. My husband did not believe I made this pie, that is how good it was. We went to a fancy restaurant and ate key lime pie and he said it was better than that pie and it was wonderful. So easy to make. Award winning? I think so !

This was a really big hit for my two dinner guest that my husband and I had last night. The only boo boo I made was I used regular limes instead of the itty bitty keylimes. :( But it still turned out wonderful. I used 2 cans fat free eagle brand (sweetened condensed milk) that was about 2 cups and MORE than enough. Even though it was a big hit, I feel I should of used 2 more limes. It was just perfect, but I think a can and half is more than enough. But I think the fact that I made the mistake of not using the keylimes might have something to do with it. But all in all, a great hit. Such a wonderful and easy recipe.  Next time, I will be using keylimes lol! xoxo happy eating people!

The BEST Key Lime Pie I've ever had or made.  I was looking for an egg-free recipe (son is allergic) and this caught my eye.  I made it for a summer bbq and it was a hit.  My father is a key lime junkie and he gave it two thumbs up.  I couldn't find key lime juice so I used regular lime juice.  Have made it twice since.  So easy & amazing!

Fantastic pie. Made my own crust. I learned through trial and error that the key limes that are less green and more yellow produce substantially more juice.
I did make home made whipped topping, with sugar and vanilla. I think next time I will add more key limes juice but I received excellent reviews from my guests.

Incredible! This pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweet with a super creamy texture. So simple to make, it gets even better the next day. Hands down, the best key lime pie recipe that I have ever made.

Great recipe! Fast, easy and good. I'd also like to thank the reviewer who suggested juicing the limes with a garlic press - saved me a lot of time and frustration... now if someone could recommend an efficient way to zest those little suckers I'd be really happy.

Deelish!  Baked 20 minutes.  5-8 was like "why bother".  Instead of graham cracker crust, I crumbled butter cookies and mixed with sugar and butter.  I also used bottled fresh lime juice.  Makes my mouth water just thinkin' 'bout it!

I was pleasently suprised by this recipe. I didnt have Keylime juice so i used regular bottled lime juice and the juice of two fresh limes.I also scaled the recipe down to 6 sevings due to the fact I only had 2 cans of the milk. Pretty sure had i made the full recipe it would've made 2 pies. I only baked it for 8 mins and it came out PERFECT I will deffinetly be making this for family gatherings and bake sales from now on. Yopu cant go wrong with a recipe like this!

my son loves key lime pie. this recipe is awesome.  the only change I made was to add some lime zest and to bake it for a few more minutes.  I have given this recipe to lots of friends.  One is not a baker AT ALL.  She made this for her family 4th of July party and they all thought that she had bought it.  She was so proud.   This is so easy and delicious.

I don't know how a real REAL key lime pie is supposed to taste, but this pie rocks. And I only used used regular limes--sorry purists--and it is now my wife's favorite. She says this is going to be the one we take every where for parties. It's easy, fast and amazing. I put it in Graham Cracker I crust off this website. Totally. Deeeeeslish.

I made this pie for my boyfriend's birthday, and trust me it is to die for. (Though with an entire kilo of condensed milk I suspect that might be the case if you eat too much!)Will definitely be making this again! The only substitution I made was to add a little extra lime juice as I used bottled juice and didn't have enough zest from my one lime... but it was nice like this :)

I know what you're thinking... "How can a recipe this easy and with so few ingredients taste good?"  I had my doubts too.  Until I took my first bite.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  This pie is fabulous!  Heavenly!  Divine!!  And oh so easy!  It's a perfect, refreshing treat for those hot summer days :)

I can't believe I am saying this, but I found the pie to be terribly sweet. And I have quite the sweet tooth. I tried it again and used one can of evaporated milk and one can of condensed milk. (14 oz). The result was a much lighter pie and less sweet, but it does drain a little water about ever 6-12 hours.

Amazing! Creamy, slightly tart, perfect. Other reviews were helpful. I did use the 20 key limes as suggested. I cut each one in half and squeezed them with a garlic press. Thanks for the tips! This recipe will be repeated often!

This pie is amazing and so easy.  I couldn't believe the thick, cream consistency that it had with the ingredients and such little baking time.  I made this for some people who live in the north and had never had key lime pie before -- let me tell you, they are hooked now!!!

For how easy this was you can't beat it! I loved the creamy texture. I found that 2 cans of condensed milk is only 2 1/2 cups though, so to be safe I used enough from a 3rd can to make 3 cups. I know a lot of reviews said they just used 2 cans, but I wasn't sure. Also used bottle key lime juice and it was fine. I baked about 10 minutes and never saw bubbles. Better the next day. Edited: I've made this with 3 cups of sweetened evaporated milk and I've made it with 2 cans. I think it's much better made as written, the creamier taste and texture make this pie so much better.

This pie was outstanding.  Silky smooth and nice lime taste.  I used a store bought crust due to time constraints but it was still delicious.  And very simple to make.

In a panic I searched for a recipe that did not need cream cheese and whip topping like the recipe I was going to make but I forgot to buy these ingredients.  I won't be going back to the old recipe after this.  Thanks for posting.

So easy and so delicious.  I've never made key lime pie before, but with 1300+ reviews and such a high rating, I figured that I couldn't go wrong.

2 cans of condensed milk and the allotted amount of key lime juice gave this the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  It took me closer to 12 minutes to get it cooked to the proper consistency (I think that has more to do with my oven than the recipe itself).

The ONLY pie my boyfriend will eat is key lime, and he gave this 2 thumbs up.  It's definitely a keeper!

I didn't love the texture of this pie.  It was a little to pudding like for my taste.  I prefer a fluffier key lime pie.  That said, no one else felt that way and it was really easy to make.  The flavor was good.

I have never in my life had key lime pie so after reading the reviews on this I thought I must try it. My whole family loved this. Personally I thought the sweetened condensed milk gave it alittle bit of a weird heaviness that was borderline strange with the lime flavor. It certainly didn't ruin it by any means, I guess I just imagined something alittle lighter like lemon pie is. I will keep making it however considering the family's reaction.

I made this recipe for Father's Day, and four days later, I still can't believe how amazing this pie turned out.  I made a really, really thick graham cracker crust and my whole family (including my father) wouldn't stop telling me how amazing the pie is!  Thank you for the recipe!

Amazing recipe! Made it just as listed, no changes. I did make my own graham cracker crust. I've made it twice now, for neighborhood block party and for husband's work party and have had several requests to make it again. This recipe is a keeper!

DELICIOUS! Tastes Just Like A Keylime Pie I Had At A 5 Star Restaurant that was to die for! And it went for 8 dollars a slice! So glad I can make it at home for a quarter of the price! Thanks so much for the recipe. Its FABULOUS

Based on other reviews I only used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. It was more than enough. Also I used the bottle key lime juice.

Everyone loved it

This pie is awesome.  This was the first key lime pie I have ever made.  The recipe is simple and delicious.  It was a favorite at our party.  Will make this pie many more times.

This was the most amazing key lime pie.  My family loved it.  It took very little effort or time to prepare.  My daughters now want to make this any chance they get.

This pie turned out delicious. I actually made my own sweetened condensed milk, and ended up using a bit more lime juice, as I like my pies tart.

Rather than squeezing all of those litle key limes, I use Joe & Nellie's Key Lime Juice, found at our local grocery store.  This is a great pie--I have subbed cream cheese for the sour cream for a little bit heavier pie.  Either way...a little bit of heaven!

this was my first time making key lime pie and it turned out great! i would use fresh lime juice (it's worth the struggle!). it set perfectly overnight, but it was a tiny but too limey for me, but it was still terrific.

Just made this pie on 8/18 for my own birthday and must say that it is to die for! No changes needed....but I did use a shortbread crust just due to preference. So easy & absolutely delicious!

SOOOO GOOD! It was rich and delicious!! I used light whip cream on the top I think full fat whip cream would make it over the top too rich. I cant believe how easy it was to make, I WILL be making this again and again!

I made 1/3 of this recipe and used it as the bottom layer to my two layer keylime pie (top layer being a nobake keylime pie recipe on this site). It was really good and I think I'll make it a thicker layer next time. Amazing consistency and didn't taste at all like sour cream, thank goodness.

Good recipe, but I don't see where everyone is getting 20-30 limes.  I used 6 regular sized limes and had plenty of juice.  I don't know if they were squeezing by hand or not; I used an actual juicer.  It isn't electric, but it's purpose is to juice citruses.  Don't buy too many lemons!

Doubled recipe, made graham cracker crusts from scratch, used bottled key lime juice, 4 cans of condensed milk,  reduced fat sour cream (only kind in store), and decorated with fresh strawberry slices after baking/cooling. Had some extra filling, so baked it in custard cups with graham cracker crumbled on top. People loved both :)

Great recipe. I followed the entire thing, but added green food coloring to provide more color. I also made my own graham cracker crust. I took this to a 4th of July cookout and everyone loved it. Very easy recipe and it taste fresh.

This was very good and well received by our guests. My only substitution was I made a home-made gluten free crust using 30 small gluten free gingersnaps and 5 TB butter (in food processor, pulse cookies into crumbs, mix with melted butter, press into pie plate, bake @ 350 for 7-8 min, let cool and use as recipe directs). I had bottled key lime juice as a back up to the actual key limes, in case what I bought wasn't enough...I ended up needing a couple tablespoons of it to equal 3/4. I would make this again. Thank you for an easy, tasty recipe :-)

Very good recipe, very simple, easy to make.  I modified the recipe by adding more lime and I made a crust out of vanilla wafer cookies.  Family loved the modified version.  Will definately make again. Thanks

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! I microwaved the limes a little to make them easier to squeeze. The pie came out sweet and tart, just like a good Key lime pie should!

My wife made having never before attempted making key lime pie.  It turned out amazing.  Creamy and tart, but not overly tart.  Just right.

I have been making key lime pies ever since visiting Key West several years ago.  This is the closest Ive come to the flavor and texture of Blonde Giraffe.  The ommission of egg yolks and addition of the sour cream makes the pie lighter in texture and less like a custard.  I will definately use this from now on.

Yummy!  This is by far the best recipe I've tried for Key Lime Pie.   I made the recipe using the extra slice graham cracker crust and increased the filling by 1/2 so I had just a little bit left over.  Definitely a keeper

My sister requested Key Lime Pie for her birthday, so I made this one. She loved it! She grunted in satisfaction LoL   I remember not liking Key Lime Pie at a restaurant, so I only tried half a piece, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was great, thanks!

I made this for a birthday celebration for a family member.  I am not a huge fan of key lime pie and I loved it!  My only complaint (which has nothing to do with the actual recipe) is that I had a bag of about 30 key limes and got just over 1/2 cup of juice!!!  It still turned out delicious and everyone enjoyed it!

I made the mistake of not reading the comments, and I used 3 cans of condensed milk, not two. It really did taste amazing though, and very easy to make! I surely will use 2 cans next time. So delicious!

The Flavor was phenomenal - wonderful key lime flavor.  And the best part was that this recipe was SO EASY.  However, I only gave 4 stars, because the pie wasn't as firm as I hoped...it wasn't soupy, but it just didn't hold together well.  maybe I will ad a little less sour cream next time.  Anyhow, great recipe - give it a shot!

I am not fond of key lime; however, my mom loves it but she is very particular about them. I decided to try this recipe for her birthday and what a success. She could not get over how good it was. She actually told me and everyone that it was the best key lime pie she had ever eaten!!! Thank you! Oh and I followed the recipe exactly!!

Simple to prepare and outstandingly impressive . . I use a LOT of whipped cream on top.Folks I have shared this with think I am a genius .  I also decorate the pie with gossamer slices of whole lime. I more than double the amount of grated rind than I did initially. I use a garlic press to juice the little suckers .  Anyone have a better idea ?

My father requests a pie about every other week, and everyone who's tried it has asked for the recipe. I couldn't find lime zest though, so I use a few squirts of real lime juice (not the imitation ). and did I mention that it takes absolutely no time to make? Delish!

Not a bad recipe, easy to do.  It could have had more lime taste to it, but my girlfriend said it was tangy enough.  Using actual limes is expensive; they are .99 cents each for me so I went with William-Sonoma's Key Lime juice.  Some recipes call for meringue but I've never seen that on a Key Lime pie, nor do I like it.  I made whipped cream (using heavy whipping cream, powedered sugar, vanilla and sour cream) and put a drop on top.  As others said, 2 cans of condensed milk is ABOUT 3 cups.  I could not find 9" pie crust, only 10", so it wasn't full to the top.  I would chill the pie for more then 2 hours; it was not ready by then.  I also used 1/2 cup of sour cream, however, it could probably be better with 1/4 cup.  All in all, its a work in progress.

The texture was great and it's very easy. I add more key lime than suggested because to me if Key-Lime pie doesn't give you canker soars, then it's not worth it.  I've made it a couple of times but I have yet to see the top bubble as suggested. It always turns out well.

Really good key lime flavor.  I used bottled key lime juice as I was short on time and a little fresh lime juice to liven it up.  I also made a pretzel curst instead of the graham cracker crust.  Definately a keeper!

I LOVED THIS! I made them into Mini pies, it made 12. I would use 1 cup of juice next time I like my key lime pie tart. EVERYONE loved it! It made my recipe book! Thanks for posting!

This is the first time I made key lime pie and it was delicious.  I used others suggestions to squeeze the limes using a garlic press as well as the notes that 20 key limes for 3/4 cup Key Lime juice and 2 Cans of sweetened condensed milk is 3 cups.  This was great!  Thanks.

This is my new favorite dessert! I can't get enough of it! I use the small bottles of lime juice instead of squeezing the limes myself and I top it off with cool whip and fresh berries. Delicious!

To lizbeefroast,

They have been making bottled key lime juice since forever. You can find it in the juice aisle of any grocery store.

Delicious! Just the way key lime pie should be- both creamy and tart at the same time. Perfect balance of the two. Couldn't taste the condensed milk at all. Will definitely be making again.

This was the first key lime pie I've ever made and I will never look for another recipe again. I made it for my friend's birthday and everyone who tasted it said it was the best they had ever had. It tastes very fresh because of the fresh lime juice and zest.

To more easily squeeze the key limes, I cut them into quarters and then squeezed them using my garlic press. I think it took about 15-20 key limes. I also baked it for about 9 minutes. 

You can't go wrong with this recipe, I promise!

Unfortunately key limes aren't readily available in the UK so I made with regular limes but still came out great!  Graham crackers and graham cracker crusts aren't readily available here either so substituted 8 oz of digestive biscuits (crushed) combined with 3.5 oz butter (melted) to make the crust.  I followed the advice of others - 2 tins condensed milk = 3 cups and baked for no longer than 10 mins.

Here's review #800 - Excellent pie and so very easy.  I received a new heavy duty, but manual juicer that just about turns the citrus half inside out to get every last drop of juice - we all love this recipe - will go to the front of my recipe file and replace any other Key Lime Pie recipe I might have ever been tempted to use.

Amazing!!! This was SO EASY and tasted fantastic. This will be a go-to recipe for me from now on. I topped mine with home-made whipped cream to balance the tart lime flavor, and it was a huge hit among our guests. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

I've made this pie on several occasions and it has been a hit. Very simple and easy to make. Don't do what I did the first time I made it; I measured out the Sweetened Condensed Milk and it took 3 cans to get 3 cups even though the can is 14 oz and there was too much and the pie wasn't tart enough. Now I go with the fact that 1 cup is 8 oz and 2 cans is 28 ounces (just 4 ounces over 3 cups) and the pie has been great. I like my pie a little tarter than most so I add a little extra key lime juice (not too much) and a little extra grated lime zest (again, not too much).

The hardest part of this recipe was finding actual Key Limes and squeezing the juice out of them. I actually used nearly 30 of the little buggers. The recipe is fantastic, as is. The only thing I'll try to do differently next time, (purely for aesthetic reasons), is to whip the mixture a little more to see if I can increase the volume.

This recipe was great! I made it for my grandfather's surprise birthday party and everyone loved it! This was so simple but delicious! Everyone said it was great and I replied that it was easy, only 5 ingredients! Though, I would recomend that you use 2 cans of evaporated milk rather than 3 because otherwise it will not fit into the pie pan. I guess that you could also just use three cans and make two smaller pies or one deep dish, whatever works best for your situation. As big of a hit as mine was, two pies might be wise! :)

I made this pie last week because I was having some friends over for dinner and thought key lime pie would follow Jambalaya perfectly. Great call on my part I have to say. My friends loved this pie and what makes it so great is that it's so easy to make. The only thing I changed was that I added 1 cup fresh lime juice. Now this is the desert that all my friends insist that I make for potlucks. I also made homemade whip cream which I found on this site as well.

We followed the exact ingredients and it turned out perfect! We are not the cook type people since we seem to always mess up a box of mac and cheese. We chose this recipe because it seemed easy for us and it was so easy and yummy! We made it tonight just to see if we could do it and how it would turn out hoping that it would be perfect we wanted to have it for our Thanksgiving Dinner and it will be made for our Thanksgiving Dinner it is that yummy!!!! :)

HUGE hit every time I make it. Around the 4th of July though, make sure you buy your key lime juice in advance--I checked seven stores that day and it was all sold out and I had to squeeze about 45 little key limes to get that much juice and it was BRUTAL. But its so worth it. I wouldn't really recommend mixing the zest inside--a guest once asked me if it was "grass" in the pie. Clueless, yes, but it made me realize that the green specks aren't too visibly appealing. Save the rind for some peel curls on top.

This pie is AWESOME tasting and so simple!  We have a key lime tree and make this about once a week when the limes are in.  As other reviewers mentioned, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk is 3 cups.  I use the fat free condensed milk and instead of sour cream I have used non fat Greek Yogurt.  It tastes just the same and is better for you.  My whole family loves this!!

A great,  easy and quick recipe for anyone to be able to put together.  After reading the other's reviews, I used my garlic crusher to squeeze the limes like suggested.  A tip to make it easier: zest your limes first then cut those up into quarter size pieces.  It makes them easier to squeeze out the juice and you get more out of each lime.  My pies also did not bubble, but I did not cook them over the recommended 5 to 8 minutes.  ENJOY!!!

Delicious, simple, refreshing. Make sure you have a zester, takes too long to zest by hand with a fork!

So easy and delicious. This was my first time making key lime pie but it turned out perfect. It baked for 10 minutes (I never saw pinholes on the top though) and I used 35 key limes to get the 3/4 cup of juice. I also omitted the tablespoon of zest because I don't have a zester and my hands were numb after squeezing 35 key limes...totally worth the work though!

Very good,  very creamy texture. I cheated and used bottled lime juice instead of squeezing the limes...limes were $0.65 EACH! There's no way I was making a pie for $20. Also in Canada our condensed sweetened milk comes in 300mL cans, so I had to use 3. Low fat sour cream works just as fine too. Oh and I waited and waited to see those tiny bubbles break, but they never did...I must've baked for at least 20 minutes before I ended up just taking it out, but it never browned. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. This was the second key lime pie I made. The first one was from a different recipe on this site and used eggs, but this is now my favorite recipe. I made it for a party and it went really fast because it was soooo good. The only thing I did differently was make my own crust and that made it even better. I just added ground almonds and sugar to the graham cracker crumbs before adding melted butter, then baked it for a few minutes to make it a little crisp before adding the filling.  I think a great crust always enhances the pie eating experience.  This pie was just as good as the one I bought in Key West. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good pie and extremely easy. However, in my opinion, I did not think adding lime skin into the batter was a good idea, as the pieces are hard to chew and swallow after baking. Otherwise an easy dessert that is sure to bring people back.

Delicious! I couldn't find key limes, or key lime juice so I just used regular limes you can find at any grocery store and it turned out really well. I never saw the bubbles while I was baking, even after keeping it in for an extra 10 minutes. It still came out wonderful, it wasn't over-baked or anything!

I made this pie for my husband's birthday since key lime is one of his favorite's. The flavor was good, but the texture was a little to soft. He would have preferred a firmer slice of pie. It was definitely easy to make, but I have another recipe I like better.

I'm giving it 4 stars, though I'd rather give 4 1/2.  I made it largely as directed, however I had to zest using only a knife, so I couldn't exactly grate the zest.  It ended up in tiny confetti like squares of zest that I felt took away from the consistency of the pie.  Perhaps using a proper zester would have made it different, but I suspect I still would have had pieces of zest in it, just smaller pieces.  I really don't think it needed the zest though.  The bites I had that lacked the zest tasted great.  When I did get some of the zest, it did provide a burst of lime, but it seemed a bit inconsistent in taste with the pie.  I used a normal lime for the zest, and suspect that a key lime would have been better (we don't have key limes here).  Given my experience with and without zest, as long as you use true key lime juice, I suspect it would be an amazing pie even without the zest.  I've been to the Keys a few times, and I must say the supposedly "best" key lime pies I had down there, did not have noticeable pieces of zest in them.  They were perfectly smooth in consistency.

I love Key Lime Pie and had been searching for a good recipe and I'm so happy I came across this one! It tastes wonderful, it takes a very short time to prepare, and a very short time to cook. Put it in the oven for ten minutes instead of 5-8 as the recipe suggests; it comes out better. Also, I used a bit more lime zest and it gave it that extra tart flavor and cut back on the sweetness of the sweetened condensed milk. If you, like me, prefer lip-puckering goodness, used the peel from two Mexican limes (about 5 key limes) and it'll do the trick!

This was a very simple and good recipe. I found that 25 key limes weren't quite enough (maybe mine were small?) and all I had was bottled lime juice to make up the extra amount (a bit less then 1/4 cup). BIG mistake! The pie turned out pretty bitter tasting! Definitely stick to fresh juice only!

Not my favorite by far.  I think the sour cream is too strong a flavor for the pie.  It's a bit too thick and just not that great.

My Husband loves Key lime pie and he goes nuts over this recipe, every time I make it he tells me it's the BEST key lime pie ever! I always put a layer of cool whip on top.

This pie was FABULOUS :) My whole family enjoyed it, even my father, who typically only eats desserts that are engorged in chocolate. I didn't have much time on my hands, so I left out the lime zest, and it still turned out great! I will be sure to make this recipe again soon!

This pie was easy to make with the exception of the 3/4 cup of key lime juice. I probably squeezed 40 miniature key limes and still got less than 1/2 cup of lime juice. Next time, I'm buying a bottle of key lime juice from the store. It had good flavor but definitely needed more lime for a good tart lime flavor.

Fabulous! Honestly, I don't quite understand how this sets up so beautifully without eggs or some kind of binder (maybe there is something in sweetened condensed milk?)... I made 2 of these last week while we were at the beach. Thumbs up all around!! Rich, smooth and delish! A keeper :) I used premade crust because I was on vacation and lazy, but next time I will make my own. I used a shortbread crust for one and graham cracker for the other. Both we wonderful. I wonder how these would be frozen?

Wow... This was exceptional. I have never made a key lime pie. Nor have I really eaten one but it was a special request so I made it for my brother in laws birthday. He said the real kicker for him was the zesty lime in the mix. Everyone gobbled this up. I also added some homemade whip cream around the edges and decorated it with some lime wedges (only for pictures purposes).   The only request made is that the next time around I add more of the lime zest into the mix. Other then that EVERYONE raved over this recipe!!!

Very good recipe!!!  This was my first attempt at a key lime pie and I will never use another recipe!  It wasn't too sweet, which I liked.  I did have to bake it longer though.  It may have been my oven, but it took about 25 minutes for the pinholes to appear.  Despite this, it turned out great (didn't taste over-done and the crust didn't burn).  This one's a keeper!

I thought this was good.  It was my first attempt at making a key lime pie and I am comparing the taste with the key lime pie at this great seafood restaurant, which was AMAZING. I’m not sure I will find anything to match it, so I can’t give 5 stars until I find “the one”.    This was good. I substituted fat free condensed milk (I ended up using 2.5 cans) and low fat sour cream.  It was creamy and had almost a cheesecake like consistency with a nice lime taste.

VERY easy and VERY yummy.  I calculated out the sweetened condensed milk though (other viewers said 2 cans was close enough to 3 cups).  2 cans equals 2 2/3 C.  I felt like it needed the extra 1/3 cup.  Perfect texture and flavor to this pie.  I used normal lime juice because I could not find key lime juice.  Simply delicious!

This recipe is super easy and quick--even if you make the graham cracker crust from scratch and freshly squeeze the limes. Five stars for speedy-fastness. Taste, on the other hand, was three star worthy. I thought this recipe was too sweet and rich with a heavy, creamy texture. I guess my preference leans towards a lighter, more refreshing key lime pie with a fluffier texture. Overall, not bad, but I won't be making this recipe again unless I need to put together a pie in half an hour or less.

I used a store bought graham cracker crust and frozen limeade instead of freshly squeezed lime. Beat a cup of heavy whipping cream with a tablespoon of spoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla and covered the pie with the cream. WONDERFUL.

Awsome!! I love the strong taste of lime.  Once I made it with lemons only and it was still really good. Do it with lemons if the flavor is too strong as it was for my sister-in-law or try half of the juice of limes and half of lemons if you don't like strong flavors.   Do use 2 cans of condensed milk.  It is a little less than what it asks for but it is just right for consistency and volume for one pie.  This is the first time my husband says he likes a dessert.  We loved it.   Thank you so much for the recipe because as a beginner it is very difficult to find something so amazing and so easy to make as this pie.

Key Lime pie is my favorite and I'm a tough critic.  This recipe is absolutely THE BEST!  I live in Alaska, where Key limes are $3 apiece, so I used about half regular (squeezed) lime juice and the rest bottled (Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice).  It worked very well.  The texture was firm and creamy and had that jaw tingling quality I look for in Key Lime pies.  I used the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site and piped some homemade whipped cream on top.

Outstanding! And I am a conservative reviewer! This recipe was exactly what I was hoping for, ultra creamy, just right with the lime flavor (not overpowering like some I've tried). All my guests said it should be entered in a contest it was so good! Thanks for the recipe!

As a Floridian and a fan of Key West I have to say I was skeptical.  However, based on great reviews I elected to make it for my girlfriend's birthday.  I am really glad I did.  Like most I used 2 cans of condensed milk, and in place of key limes I used the juice from eight (8) Persian limes and two (2) lemons.  Juicing your own citrus is quite the workout - be prepared.    Cooked for 15 minutes at 350, then I put in the fridge for 5 hours to cool.  The use of one tablespoon of zest seemed like a lot, but it made a big difference.    I will definitely be making this pie again - simple and amazing.  I would be interested in reducing the sugar and adding some mango nectar for a little variation...

This is a great recipe for key lime pie. So easy with great flavor and creamy texture. My personal preference was only 1 teaspoon of lime zest. I used my electric hand mixer, poured into a store bought shortbread crust and baked 10 minutes until I saw the little pinhole bubbles. I think it is better the next day because i am sitting here eating a piece for breakfast! Love it!

Fantastic and simple dessert.  I doubled the recipe and made 2 buys, and they were great. I made my own graham crust, and i couldn't find any Key Limes, so i just used half lemon juice and half lime juice and it tasted fabulous. The only time consuming part is grating the lime zest, but other then that it's super easy and super delicious!

This recipe was incredibly easy and packs a delightfully powerful punch in taste. I kept waiting for the pinhole bubbles on the surface to burst but no such luck so I took the pie out after 10 mins and it turned out perfectly!  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for this recipe that made this beginner delighted in being able to make something that tasted absolutely wonderful.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was PERFECT!! I wouldn't change a thing!! Be aware that key limes can be difficult to find, you may need to go to a specialty store (I did). It was about 30 key limes, but a $10.00 handheld juicer made it super easy. I did make my own graham cracker crust, which does make a difference. VERY yummy, perfect key lime pie!!!!

5 stars for how easy it is to make and 5 stars for how yummy this pie is.  I've made so many key lime pies in the past, but this recipe is by far the best I've ever made.  I love that you don't have to use egg yolks too!  I followed the recipe except I used 1 cup of key lime juice and the pie firmed up perfectly!  Love, love, love this recipe!

The PERFECT KEY LIME RECIPE! My family and I eat a lot of low-fat foods and are always trying recipes substituted with low/non-fat ingredients... some work and some don't. THIS ONE DID!! I had to make the pie crust with low-fat crackers then used the fat-free sweetened condensed milk and fat-free sour cream and the pie turned out so sweet and tart even my mom who doesn't like key lime pie asked me to make another one! If you love key lime pie you need to try this easy recipe!

So simple to make, and so yummy! I was hesitant to try making a key lime pie, but there is no reason to fear this simple recipe. I couldn't really see the pinhole bubbles, but I just baked it for 10 minutes, and that seemed to work out just fine. I then froze it overnight, and the next morning spread some Cool Whip on top and sprinkled with some lime zest to make it nice and pretty. I put it in the fridge after that, and by the time we took it to our party that afternoon, it was perfect. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Yummy! I think I prefer this to the standard recipe that calls for egg yolks. This was a little bit lighter, not quite as dense. But the taste is the same - wonderful! I used no topping; it doesn't need it.

Made this recipe exactly as directed and it came out fantastic.  The hardest part was squeezing 1 & 1/2 lbs. of key limes to make the juice!  Easy, fast, and delicious.

This was so easy to make and it was a crowd pleaser. I added a little fresh sqeezued lime juice for some added flavor. This was great!

I really like the taste and consistency but it´s not entirely what I was looking for, giving it was too sweet. Next time I try this recipe I think it would be a good idea to stick to one can of condensed milk but add 1 8onz package of Philadelphia cream cheese to lessen the sweetness, however I would like it if someone (a more experienced baker) could help me out as to how much time should I bake it if I add the cream cheese. Pls

All I can say is wow! I made a graham cracker crust to go with it because I felt it would taste better than a pre-made crust. I let the filling sit for 30 minutes so  flavors fell into one another. I followed the ingredients with no changes! I tasted the filling before it went into the pie crust and it was perfect! Amazing recipe, and definitely one I will be making again! GOOD JOB!

Fantastic key lime pie recipe!  I made my own crust (because I had the time) using lemon shortbread cookie crumbs. Like other reviewers, I didn't notice any pinhole bubbles, so I just baked it for about 8 minutes.  Easy and delicious.

Nice sour taste! Haha. :) I used regular limes because, well, I didn't want to squeeze 100 key limes. I used about 10 or 12 limes. It was creamy and held it's shape well. The 6 coworkers who tried it said they liked it. I recommend cutting fairly small slices because it's so rich.

Fantastic recipe!  My husband asked for a key lime pie for Easter dinner and the look on his face when he took the first bite was WELL worth squeezing all those limes!  I'll definitely make this again...thanks so much!

This recipe was fabulous! It was a little to tart but I don't know how I would change that. The only thing I will change is that next time I will add a little food coloring to get a green tint.

Not having tasted any florida pies was not sure how this was supposed to taste however it was so simple I used a vanilla wafer crust 1 and 1/2 cup crumbs with 6tbl butter wafer is already sweet so no sugar needed. The filling I mixed lime and lemon juice to get the keylime flavour since we don't have this type in my country. This was easy and soooo tasty right mix of sweet and tang and easy to make it took 10min in my oven.  Will make this again for sure.

I took it to a pot luck at work and it was a hit (for those that like key lime pie).  I used fresh-squeezed key limes and I think it was worth the effort.  It was very rich and creamy so I cut it into fairly thi n slices (I got 20 slices out of the 9-inch pie).

Much better than the pies that do not have the sour cream, but still way too sweet. I never did get any bubbles while it was cooking, I ended up cooking for 10 minutes.

This recipe rocks! I've made this pie a couple times. Although, I used fat free condensed milk and low fat sour cream. I also used more lime juice. I hand squeezed fresh limes to the perfect taste. I also made it once with lemons and rasberries just to switch it up. That too, rocked.

Great pie and relatively easy to make. Just plan on the lime juicing to take up quite a bit of your time. This recipe is a keeper, but def. not a frequent due to the time it takes to juice the lemons.

Likely the best key lime pie I have tasted.  While the juicing of the key limes is tedious it is well worth it!  No adjustments needed!

This was very good, but extremely sweet and that's why I'm gving it 4 stars. Very easy to make, especially with the store bought crust. Maybe some homemade whipped cream with little or no sugar would be nice to balance the sweetness.

I got nothing but compliments on this pie!  I only used 1 1/2 tsp. of lime zest and used a homemade graham cracker crust.  Fanstastic!

If you're like me, you look at this and think:  SOUR CREAM?!?  Don't be turned off by it.  I am the world's biggest Key Lime Pie snob, and this is hands down the best recipe I've found.  I tried many others that were much more complicated and not nearly as good.  Being the novice cook that I am, I didn't add the lime zest, but I can't imagine anything making this pie better.  Usually my cooking skills are limited to pushing START on the microwave, and any time I've tried zesting a lime(as other recipes insist on) I've ended up adding a bitter aftertaste.  Apparently I'm zesting too far down.  Other than that, I would say don't play with this recipe at all.  It doesn't need any tweaking.  Your friends will think you're some kind of genius in the kitchen with this pie and only you'll know how incredibly simple and easy it is.

I had a craving for Key Lime Pie and decided to try this recipe. I made it exactly as directed (except I doubled it!) and squeezed about 40 key limes with a garlic press to get the juice. I coupled the recipe with a highly rated graham cracker crust recipe on allrecipes.com. Anyway, I gave one pie to a family friend who happens to be a professional chef. He immediately sent me an email after he tried the pie and said it was "hands down, the very best Key Lime Pie he had ever had in his entire life." My husband, who doesn't care for Key Lime Pie, also couldn't stop eating it. This is a winner. You won't regret trying this pie!

This is the best Key Lime Pie I have ever made. I followed the advise of Lemmonsgirl and used 20 key limes. I made my own crust and whipped cream...delicious. I would not change a thing on this recipe.

This pie came out beautifully.  I had accidentally left the rack low in the oven when I placed the pies in so it took about 20 minutes or so before the tiny bubbles opened at the edges of the pie.  But after it cooled down and I refridgerated it the pie was nice and firm and maintained it's shape when cutting it, almost like cheesecake. I made this pie using reduced fat versions of the ingredients to cut the calories a bit.  Light sour cream, reduced fat sweetened condensed milk, reduced fat graham cracker pie crust. The only thing is that I thought the pie was just a tad too sweet for my taste.

An easy recipe with excellent-tasting results. We used up a good number (20) of Mexican limes from the tree in our backyard and the results still drew praise at our Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks, so much, for the recipe!

Key Lime Pie is my favorite and this one is just delicious.  I used 1/2 cup key lime juice per pie, but I think ideally right between 1/2 and 3/4 cup would be perfection.  A snap to make.

The filling makes more than I expected. I bought a prepared crust--your basic shell--and had about 1 1/2 cups left over after the crust was filled completely. I recommend getting the crust that has the 2 extra servings. Also, 2 (14 oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk is not enough. It leaves you about 1/2 c. short. If you don't plan for this (which I didn't) you can use this substitute: combine over medium heat 3/4 c. evaporated milk & 3/4 c. sugar heat until dissolved. Use only what you need. The taste overall is a little sweeter than I like for a key lime pie but that might be due to the substitution. I also never got the bubbles to pop as stated in the recipe and ended up cooking it almost 15 minutes before I just took it out and am hoping for the best. ...

Awesome recipe. I also used real key lime juice, only used 17 key limes though (i used a hand held lime juicer), 2 cans of low-fat sweetened condensed milk, and graham crackers pie crust from keebler. I didn't really see pin holes so I just took my pie out at 12 minutes, Place the plastic lid that came with the pie crust back on, and left it in the fridge overnight. Pie firmed up really well by morning. Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

Wow!  My husband and I just had our first slice of pie and it was great!  Incredibly easy to make and delicious.  A little sweet for us, so I will just cut our next slices a little smaller to compensate.  I will definitely be making this pie again!

Excellent! Huge contrast between sour and sweet. If using fresh limes be prepared to increase prep time. It takes about 20 limes to get 3/4 cup of juice. In my oven bubbles did not break the surface until after 15 minutes. I used the graham cracker crust II and everyone who had the pie wished for a thicker crust...

I cannot believe key lime pie is so easy!  This is wonderful, my dad goes crazy for it.  I usually add some extra juice and zest for a more limey taste.  Will be making this often I'm sure!

Tasty, very rich pie. I squeezed about a billion key limes and zested about half of them, but finally got my juice. Used the graham cracker Crust I recipe from this site... I didn't get the pinholes when baking and finally took it out of the oven after around 12 minutes. All in all, very good recipe... although the filling wasn't quite enough for my 9-inch pie pan.

Super-easy to make and tasted incredible.  Not overly tart like some key lime pies are. I couldn't find key lime juice, so I just used regular lime juice.

Juicing 20-25 Key Limes is a pain!  I used a garlic press to juice them (as suggested by Reviewers here) but that's a bit messy and tedious for me - particularly when whipping up a quick-and-easy recipe. Does anyone know a quicker, more efficient way to juice the Key Limes?  VERY tasty recipe!

It was sooo easy to make! Used key lime juice as we don't have key lime here, and used a bit less than 3/4 cups, and a bit more graham crackers and a touch more butter too... Overall 10 stars!!!

I didn't have key limes, so used limes from the tree in the yard- it only took 3 limes to get enough juice! I used the "whipped cream" recipe from this site as well as the "graham cracker crust 1" recipe. The whipped cream was unnecessary- I actually scraped it off. And I wouldn't use the cinnamon in the crust next time when paired with this pie. I also want to try with key limes, because my limes were super sweet, and it would be nice to have a bit more tang with this pie. Still, I was amazed at how easy this was to make. Everyone raved about this pie ("scrumptious!", "heavenly", "soooooooooo delicious!" were some of the comments).  This would be great to whip up for potlucks- it looks pretty, tastes yummy, and is easy to make. Thanks! PS: The pie seems to improve a fair bit after being refrigerated overnight.

Tastes great, and very easy to make! I had trouble seeing the pinhole bubbles though. Regardless it came out perfectly! I cut the entire recipe in half, and used 6 mini pie shells. I had just enough filling, the perfect amont. It was a great consistency and the flavor was perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, not too sour. I will definitely be putting this one in my recipe book.

It was a little too sweet for me but my wife raved about it. I wanted it to be a little more tart from the sour cream and the lime, so next time I'll adjust the ingredients accordingly.

Used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk without measuring. Used regular limes and juiced them. Pie never bubbled, so baked for about 12 minutes.  Extremely rich pie! I don't know how often I will make it because it is so rich unless I can find a way to substitute some of the ingredients.  Made the pie with "Graham Cracker Crust".

I was not a big fan of key lime. But this pie made me a fan. The pie was so rich and creamy I am now a fan. It may be more work but do use fresh key limes.

Very easy to make and very tasty. I cooked it 15 minutes and never saw any of the little bubbles. I used 2 full and a little bit of a 3rd can of the milk and feel that next time I will just used 2 cans of milk. I look forward to making this again.

I give this 4 stars for its simplicity and taste but the texture kind of caught me off guard.  It is very creamy and not firm like you might expect it to be.  It didn't taste like a traditional key lime pie for this reason but it is still worth making.

This was my first Key Lime pie so I have nothing to compare it to; however, my son loved it! Personally, it was a little too rich for my taste, but it was pleasing to the palate.

Wonderful!  I have made this several times and love it.  I never add the zest, it tastes great without it. I add green food coloring just because I like it to be pale green.  Homemade graham cracker crust and homemade whip cream make it the best!  I even made individual cupcake size pies for a bridal shower and several people asked which bakery they came from.

I chose this recipe because someone said they used it based on all the reviews and they were glad they did.  That was enough for me to choose this one...and I'm glad I did!  It's very easy and VERY good!  I used the 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and the 3/4 cup of lime juice combo and it worked perfect.  After baking in the oven for 8-10 minutes and if you look closely you can see the tiny bubbles... and two hours in the fridge - then it was gone in minutes!

I have worked in some excellent fine dining restaurants that served key lime pie and I would say that this is the best that I have had. Please note that I am originally from the south and this is a must have recipe for everyone in the south.....ok and the north too!

Absolutely the best Key Lime pie recipe I've ever tried.  Easy, simple and delish!  I did use regular Mexican limes though and I had to bake mine about 15 mins before the bubbles formed.  It was perfect though - great consistency!  You can't go wrong with this one!!

I made this pie last minute for a friends birthday.  Not only did it taste amazing... I loved being able to say it was home made.  It is his favorite dessert, so his criticism would be precise, and he said it came out great!  "Reaarry wooood" he said with his mouth full. My boyfriend, birthday boy, and I each had one piece.  Birthday boy took the left over 5 pieces home with him last night, and I just received a text that he finished the pie off!  This recipe was simple and it's really worth the 5 minutes it takes to whip up the batter lol.

This is my first time making key lime pie, and it turned out sooo good!!  I did not do the zest and increased the lime juice to 1 full cup.  I did get very tiny bubbles at about 10 minutes.  I love the tart and sweet!!  I will not be trying another recipe for key lime pie.

This pie was excellent. I used Key Lime juice found in the supermarket. I brought it to a Jimmy Buffet Party and it was gone in an instant. I used a springform pan, 9 inches, and doubled the recipe. Made my own graham cracker crust. What a beautiful presentation. The only thing I would have changed was to add whipped cream to the top as a decoration.

Absolutely incredible Key Lime Pie! I used regular limes because I live in Montana and could not find Key Limes. I ended up with 1 cup of juice but it turned out great, and I did not use a graham cracker crust because I prefer the flour ones. My husband said it was the BEST PIE he ever ate!! YAY! Note: I did have to bake it longer than 10 min. but I am @ a higher altitude. Definately making this again. :-)

My Family loved this pie.  It was very easy to make and tasted good, but I think I would have preferred a stronger lime flavor.  I plan to make this again and add more lime or maybe even lemon juice.  I also used the Graham Cracker Crust II recipe and it turned out perfect. :-)

"Yummmmm!" that's exactly what my sister had to say about this pie. I changed up the recipe some with regards to the lime. I used lime juice, like the kind you get in a bottle, so I did not have any lime zest to add to the pie. I found it was lacking that extra kick for me without the zest, I just felt like something was missing. It could have also been that I didn't use juice from key limes (which I've never seen or even really heard of before). The pie was still great though, and I have no doubt that had I made it the way the recipe called for, it would have been awesome.

It really doesn't get any simpler or better than this. Can be made with lemon, lime or any combinaion of the two. Next, I'm going to try cherry juice...

I don't even like Key Lime Pie, but this was very good.  Made it for a friend, it's her favorite.  It was a really big hit, better than she'd had in a restaurant the night before!

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS! I made it as his Father's Day food gift, as he's a Key Lime pie freak. I made it in the middle of the night so he wouldn't know what I was doing! It turned out beautifully and is so creamy and rich! I did use bottled key lime juice, as I don't have a juicer and hand-juicing that many limes is beyond me, but it tasted wonderful anyway. The zest really makes this work. I baked mine for about 10 minutes both times I made this and that worked out just fine. I'm a total pie novice, but this was...well, a piece of pie, I guess!

Wow! I omitted the lime zest because my husband doesn't like the texture, otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  I baked for 10 minutes and I, too, did not see bubbles.  This was the best Key Lime Pie that I have ever had!  My Aunt who lives in Treasure Island, Florida said it was the best she had ever had!

Undeniably the BEST key lime pie I have ever tasted. I'm so glad I tried this recipe! We're going to the beach next week and I will be making 2 of these for my extended family. I'm sure they're going to love it and I'll love how easy it is! Thanks for the recipe!

This is amazingly easy for the results.  Really, REALLY easy.  Definitely a keeper.  Perfect when I need to bring a dessert - or for home - because it's prepared in advance.    I'd like some way to "dress it up" for presentation, but don't want to change the taste.  Anyone have any ideas besides some lime rind?  I'm thinking some kind of sauce you can drizzle around with maybe slivered almonds.  I used 2 cans of condensed milk (14.5 oz each), and mixed fresh lime and lemon juice.  Really good -- especially for the effort required.

This is sooo good!! Quite tangy! I have to admit the second time I made it I added 1/4 cup suger to the key lime juice and everyone loved it! Yum yum! I think it needed a bit more sweetness though.

In my head, I always thought that Key Lime Pie would be hard to make, but it's totally not.  I had this prepped and baked before my husband finished the bedtime routine w/ baby.  I used the bottled Key Lime Juice, and found that my husband prefered 2/3 cup lime juice b/c it was less tart and you could eat more of the pie in one sitting.  ;)  I didn't bother w/ the lime zest, and it was great.  Got lots of compliments and people think you took effort in making a homemade pie from scratch, when it takes close to no time to make.  Fantastic!!

So tart, but not too tart for my tastes.  I omitted the key lime zest (after juicing 20 limes, I did not feel like zesting).  Well worth the effort though.  The filling filled a deep dish pie pan just to the top.

This was absolutely delicious! I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe.  I really don't think it could have turned out any better.  My friends and boyfriend just loved it and it was so easy to make.  You definitely need 20 Key Limes that gives you just enough juice and 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk will give you 3 cups.  Don't change a thing and enjoy it!

Pretty good recipe!  I would give this a 5, but the recipe needed some tweaking.  First, 3/4 c. of lime juice was WAY overpowering.  Also, 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk about made the pie pan overflow - 2 cups is the perfect amount.  Overall, a very easy and tasty recipe (once you decrease the lime juice)!

Great recipe!  So easy and so good.  Juicing the limes is tedious, but it is worth it.  I added just one tiny drop of gree food coloring for the slightest hint of color and I made my own graham cracker crust.  Everyone loved it - I will definitely make this pie again!!

Absolutely great!  I'm new to cooking and baking, but this was really easy to make and delicious.  I used regular limes for this because it's all I could find, but it still tasted good (although I'm definitely going to try it with key limes when I get a chance) Easy 5 stars.

First time ever making a key lime pie and it turned out perfect. I only found regular limes in the store and I bought 15 and only needed about 6. Sooooo good!

Like others here, I'm not a big fan of key lime pie but my Dad sure did enjoy this!  Made it for Father's Day and it went over really well.  Thanks for sharing this, ANNRICHARDSON!

I have made this several times with key limes and once by mixing lemon/lime juice in a pinch.  Always a hit.  The only bad part is juicing all the tiny limes. :)

So good. So easy (if you cheat like me and buy bottled key lime juice!). I use lemon or lime zest depending on what I have around. Try this recipe if you haven't; it's delicious and perfect if you're crunched for time!

This pie is FANTASTIC!! I made it for Father's Day since Key Lime Pie is my husband's favorite. The family has not stopped raving about it. It's been just 2 wks and they have already requested another one. I think the sour cream is the "secret" to this pie. It really makes it set nice and firm. I've tried other recipes with egg yolks and they didn't have such a nice consistency.

This pie is fabulous! I substituted light sour cream and low-fat condensed milk.  I also purchased a graham-cracker redi-crust and also "Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice".  I was surprised to find the juice in my Arizona supermarket!

Just got back from the keys and I had the best key lime pie at a little restaurant. I was inspired to try my own..and this was better! I made it with Graham Cracker Crust I and it was phenomenal! Didn't have the lime rind and it was still amazing.

I made this pie for a college group.  It was basically inhaled!  This was the perfect blend of creamy, tart, tangy, and sweet.  It was fantastic!  Also, the graham cracker crust was a perfect crust.  Everyone was raving that they would pay me to make this pie for them again!  One of the leaders said that it tasted just like her mom made it in the old days.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I will be using it again and again.

I made this pie using 6 regular limes since that is what I had on hand.  It turned out very creamy, tart, and yummy. Just how I like them!  I used just two cans of sweetened condensed milk.  It didn't quite equal 3 cups, but the consistency was still good.  Also, since I don't like graham cracker crusts, I made a regular pie crust, and it tasted very good together.  Anyway, altogether a very good recipe!

I added a bit more lime juice (like 2 tbs) because I do like mine a bit more tart. Perfect density, smoothness and the pie didn't suffer at all from the omission of the traditional egg yolks. The measurements were also perfect for a 9 in pie!

Very easy to make! Strong lime flavor! Like other reviewers I did not get the tiny pinholes. I baked for 10 minutes and then removed from the oven. The garlic press came in handy to juice all those limes! It took about 30-35 limes to get the 3/4 cup.

This was really good!  Per other reviews, I added two 14 oz cans of condensed milk and baked for 10 minutes.  I really liked the consistency.  The next time I think I'll increase the amount of grated lime (just a personal preference).

My sister who his a huge critic of key lime pie LOVED this. I thought it was a little of the sweet side- but i think that is how key lime pie is supposed to be. Filling sat well in the pie crust and had a great texture. WIll make this again!!!

I didn't use the zest. I cut the recipe in half to make a small tart. I've made it 3 times now, everyone loves this recipe. I like the fact that there are no egg yolks in it, but it tastes so good.

Delicious!  Light and creamy.  Everyone loved this... Only note is that this dessert is high in fat from the condensed sweet milk.  We used fat free sour cream and could not tell the difference.

when i started to make this i realised i didnt have any digestives (britain's version of graham crackers)to make a crust so i used ginger nuts instead (a ginger type digestive).I also added 1 and a half tsps of ginger. This really complimented the lime. Next time i will make sure that i have all the ingredients for an authentic key lime pie!!

Awesome. I used fresh key limes & I think it was worth the trouble of squeezing them. It took a little more than 1 LB to be all the juice I needed.

This is wonderful! So easy to make and so very creamy. If you are looking for authentic Key Lime Pie, this should be in your recipe box. My family asks for this all the time.

This was so easy and delicious!! I made it with "graham cracker crust I" from this site and it went very well together. Hint with the crust: only use 1/2 the cinnamon and it will be perfect for this pie! I topped it with homemade whipped cream (whipping cream, sugar and a little mexican vanilla) and it was out of this world! Thanks for posting! A+++

I made the mistake of using 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk. Big mistake... Use 2!! Unless you like sickening sweet...I did fix it, however, by poking holes all over the top and dribbling in lime juice. I will try again in a few days with 2 cans...28oz.

EXCELLENT flavor! So fresh! Definitely not lacking in lime flavor. Firmed up really nicely. I actually expected it to be a bit less firm, but was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is awesome!  Whenever I visit my mom in FL, the first thing I do is purchase a Key Lime Pie.  Now...I won't have to.  It is creamy and sweet.  Not at all tart.  A perfect amount of lime juice.  I squeezed about 7 limes to get the 3/4 cups of lime juice.  I would absolutely recommend this recipe to anybody.  My husband who isn't crazy about key lime pie went back for seconds.  He loved it and so did I.  YUMMY!

I've lived in Florida for many years and this is a real Key West style key lime pie!  Superb in flavor and texture.  I recommend making a graham cracker crust from scratch since the butter compliments so well.

Yummy! Plan on buying atleast 20-25 key limes, and squeezing the juice for a good 20 minutes! All together a great pie!

I did use the 99 cent key lime juice in the plastic container. I used the whole thing and it was so good. I live in florida and the key limes were too expensive and I would have needed so many key limes.I might add a drop of green food coloring next time and I used a shortbread ready made crust. It was great!!!

This was the best Key Lime Pie I have ever had. I served this for dessert at Easter and there wasn't any left. I'm not fond of graham cracker crust so I substituted a shortbread crust. The tips on how many limes.. and how many cans of condensed milk.. from other reviews helped

This key lime pie is absolutely delicious and simple as can be.  My daughter and I made it for Easter dinner and it was a hit.  We used 2 cans of condensed milk and had some trouble getting more than a teaspoon of zest from our lime (got to buy a zester!), but those were the only variations.  I also did not really see the bubbles bursting, but I removed the pie after 8 minutes and that seemed to be the perfect amount of time.  Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe!!

Super easy recipe and the pie tasted delicious.  I was worried about it getting too sweet but it's perfectly balanced with a nice blend of sweet and tart.  Very refreshing!

Excellent -so fast & easy!  I used 2 (14oz) cans of fat-free sweetened condensed milk (which is still incredibly high in calories), fat-free sour cream, Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice and just a pinch of lime zest.  I made a crust out of some shortbread cookies and a little butter only because I was out of graham crackers.  It took 16 minutes in the oven before I saw the "tiny bubbles" on the surface of the pie that the recipe refers to but the pie didn't brown and it was the perfect texture.  This is extremely rich but I like it because it means that a little goes a long way!

Very good and easy to make. Pretty rich so I might consider cutting the sweet just a bit next time. It's a great recipe if you need to make some quickly.

An amazing pie!  Very easy, very creamy.  I made a lightly sweetened whipped cream to top it and it offset the sweet, rich flavor perfectly.  I upped the key lime juice to 1 c. but would increase it a little more next time.  Delicious!!

This pie is sooo yummy!  I'm from Oklahoma & couldn't find key limes or key lime juice anywhere.  So, I used regular lime juice and I was very impressed with the finished product.  The pie is quite rich but that didn't stop me from going back for seconds.  I also made my own graham cracker crust and added grated lime peel in it instead of adding it to my pie.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My family and I absolutely LOVED this recipe. My daughter wanted a Key Lime Pie for her birthday and this is the recipe I chose. I've never made a Key Lime Pie before, but with this recipe, I'll make it again. The only thing I did differently was make my own graham cracker crust. I wanted it completely homemade. Other than that, this recipe was fabulous!

This recipe is the best!  Made it for my boyfriend which eats this pie at many restaurants and he says it is the best he's ever eaten.  This was my first time having key lime pie and it was awesome! The texture is creamy and delicious. This will stay in my recipe box and be used many more times, thank you for the GREAT recipe!

This turned out great! I lived in Key Largo for a while and really missed the flavor of the Keys. As an added bonus I used a fat free crust and fat free sweetened condensed milk to ease the guilt a bit. Everything turned out perfect and I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks

Delicious!!  I didn't have key limes so I used regular limes and I think it was less tart.  Really, really good!

Absolutely the only key lime pie recipe you will ever need! It's easy to make and people love it. Even using regular limes, it tastes great. I made no changes except I didn't use Key limes. I will make this over and over again.

I made this for my husband's birthday, and he told me this was the best key lime pie he has ever had!!! I ended up adding an extra 1/4 cup of lime juice and about 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice to make it more tart, and I also made my own graham cracker crust. This is a fantastic recipe!! Thank you!

This was my first time making Key Lime pie. Excellent!! I used light sour cream and this came out amazing! I did have to bake it for 20 minutes and it came out perfectly. Really really good with a small spoonful of Cool Whip on top.

Woah! This tastes so yummy... and I do not even care much for Key Lime Pie... however my son wanted to work with limes today and talked me into it! The hardest part was squeezing the juice from the limes.. but my son thought that was the fun part! I will keep this one and use it again! Thanks so much for such an easy recipe!

I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk (which was almost three cups) and I used regular store bought limes (took about 6 or so). This was DELICIOUS! It tasted very authentic, and I lived in Florida and sampled some of the best.

AMAZINGLY EASY for a quick Key Lime Pie that's also good!  The flavor is a tad different than the traditional, but it's good and the ease of preparation makes it great.  My sister is an afficianado of key lime pies and it passed her review - "not quite exact, but very very good".

I tried this recipe out of desperation.  I couldn't let my husband come home with another one of those nasty frozen box pies.  I am happy to discover what real key lime pie is supposed to taste like.  Beautiful flavor and texture... no need for changes.  It's a keeper for sure!

My SVP decided one day to have a cook-off to win an I-Pod. I made this recipe, a first time Key Lime pie for me. I made my own Graham Cracker crust and homemade whipped cream which I spread on top of the pie. All judges commented on how this was the BEST Key Lime Pie they'd ever had, and I won, over very stiff competition. Every comment said the texture and taste were the absolute best. Don't buy from a store ever again--just whip up this super easy pie!

I could not belive how easy this recipe was. I followed the recipe and the results were good. To me it had a better taste after two days in the fridge. No calorie counting for sure! Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

This pie was SO delicious, I will definitely be making it again.

The reason it got only 4 stars was because the recipe calls for a tad too much lime juice.  Next time I will cut it down to 1/2 cup and it will get 5 stars!

I made this Key Lime Pie recently, and it was a hit. I enjoyed the creamy texture of this pie. I liked it much better than the cheesecake-like texture I'm accustomed to eating. I received many compliments on this pie and requests to make it again.

Awsome recipe!!! I got so many compliments on this pie at my company's christmas party. I used somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 c. key lime juice (only because I ran out of limes to squeeze) but it still turned out great!

Fabulous pie!  This is really pretty quick and simple to make.  I added a few drops of green food coloring and because I had a frozen pie crust I had made a few weeks earlier, I baked the pie crust and after it cooled, added the key lime mixture.  It was so good, it didn't even need whipped topping, but was excellent with a dollop. I also used Mexican limes which were available at the grocery store and are a little larger than key limes.  They were very juicy and was quicker to get the 3/4 cup of lime juice. I couldn't tell the difference in taste.

This was my first time making key lime pie. Myboyfriend is a connoisseur and he thought it was "AMAZING". I was never a fan of key lime but have become a huge fan since trying this recipe. I have made my third one this week, as the one I made for thanksgiving got eaten up and my boyfriend "needed" more and a friend who had a special request.  I made one with homemade crust and one with store bought graham..liked the store bought better actually. Otherwise follwed recipe to a T and it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe...and for earning me alot of extra point with my boyfriend ;-)

This was my first stab at key lime pie but my boyfriend is a connoisseur so I was nervous to make this recipe, (especially because this was the only one that didn't call for eggs).  I used regular limes instead of key limes and it worked just fine.  My bf said it's the best key lime he has ever tasted (and he should know, he used to live in Florida).  I will definitely make this recipe again. One more thing; there was way more filling than could fit into one, 9 inch pic crust.  I got mini pie crusts and made mini pies with the rest.

Simply wonderful!  I used bottled key lime juice for simplicity and didn't have the lime zest but I think that I'll use it the next time.  This is a great easy recipe!

I followed the recipe as written, except I added a tablespoon of lime zest to the heavy whipping cream. I left this pie at a friend's house and I got four phone calls saying this was the best key lime pie they had ever tasted. My ex even took the remainder home and almost got sick eating so much. She said she could not quit eating it. Oh, happy days.

Very easy to make. I'm not a big fan of Key Lime Pie, but I liked this one. I made it for a birthday party and it was a big hit with everyone. I used 2 Mexican Limes and 6 Key Limes. I used a juicer rather than hand squeezing the juice.

BEST Key Lime Pie I've ever had.  Super easy to make. Made my own crust. I followed the advice of others and squeezed about 20 key limes for 3/4 cup juice.  This gave it a great lime flavor.  Baked it for about 9 minutes.  It was PERFECT!!!

Excellent, excellent - only made a few modifications. Used 1 1/2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and used 2/3 cup of frozen limeade concentrate thawed (my secret ingredient) and also bumped up the zest of limes to two. 

Had to cook for about 18 minutes and let it cool 1/2 hr and then placed in the fridge. I never knew key lime pie was so easy to make!

Really easy and really tasty.  I used home made crust which put the pie over the top!  I used 2/3 cup of the "double strength" concentrate and zest from 2 regular limes. 2 cans of condensed milk was perfect for an 8" pie.  I baked it 8 minutes (as others suggested), saw the tiny bubbles and took it right out.  Perfect! I look forward to another reason to make this pie--I loved "sampling" the filling as I tweaked the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

THIS IS EXCELLENT.  I USED FAT FREE CONDENSED MILK.  NEXT TIME WOULD USE 1 CUP KEY LIME JUICE.  ALSO, BAKED 20-25 MINUTES (IT NEVER DID BUBBLE BUT WAS PERFECT).  THE LIME ZEST IS A "MUST".

I made this with a graham cracker crust instead of buying store bought. This was a great, refreshing summertime dessert! I think the more zest added, the better the flavor is! I've already made it twice in one week!

im fourteen and made this pie, so that tells you its really easy to make. my whole family gave it a 10/10! i used fat free sweetened condensed milk and light sour cream. it makes all the difference if you use a homemade graham cracker crust, which i did. there's no way to mess this dessert up, so try it!

Oh My!!!! This is a delicious pie! My 8 yr old boy loves this just as much.  Next time I make this I am going to make my own graham cracker crust.  I like the crust thick and the store bought just isnt thick enough.  But this pie gets all thumbs up!!

Excellent pie and so easy to make. I've never even had Key Lime Pie before but a co-worker really wanted one so I tried it out. Everyone loved it. Like another reviewer, mine never had bursting bubbles so I took it out just before 10 minutes. The center was very slightly runny; I probably could have left it in a few more minutes without problem.

Great! Great! Great!  I followed this recipe to the letter (I did use pre-bottled key lime juice-none that I could find) and it was SO good.  My sister who loves KLP said it was the best she's ever had.  She said that I can just keep making it for her at every family event.  I used the mini crusts instead of the big one and it was nice after letting them chill, I put a spoonful of whipped cream (homemade not cool-whip) and a slice of lime that I dusted with sugar.  It looked professionally done, so much so that my husband teased that I just bought them not made them.  This one I will be using over and over again!

I made this for my parents when they came to visit my new house.  Key Lime is my Dad's favorite and he said it was better then any restaurant version he has had.  It was delicious!  Thank you for sharing.  I am glad I choose this version.
I had Mexican limes, since that is what my grocery store had and I only needed to juice 8 of them - with the help of a reamer (thank goodness for that).

I made this pie for my family.  It was so easy and absolutely delicious.  It is, by far, the best key lime pie I have ever tasted.

Delicious, of course, it's key lime pie!  As as a side note, based solely on my observation, you will not notice the pinhole bubbles unless you physically remove the pie from the oven.  Eight minutes was perfect for my pies.

I registered on this site just so I could rate this recipe.  It was wonderful!  My husband said it was perfect!  I don't think he's ever said that before.  His friend begged me to make him one for his birthday.  Everyone at the party loved it.  If they only knew how easy it was.

Key lime pie has been a long time favorite of mine and this recipe is the easiest and tastiest key lime pie I've ever made! I followed the directions to the letter....I made six individual mini pies and had a lot left over but no more graham cracker crust so I made a crust out of vanilla wafers (20 wafers + 3 tbsp butter + 2 tbsp brown sugar). This one turned out even better than the mini pies.

I converted the servings to 10. I ended up with 2 pies! AND the crusts that I used were the 10 serving ones! Anyway it turned out great! I used the lemon extract in my whip cream. Great hit on the 4th of July!!

This is the "AWESOMEST" key lime pie I've ever had. I have made it 3 times since I found the recipe about 2 weeks ago. It is sooooo easy and sooooo delicious. A must try!!
Thanks for the great recipe!

Fear the Key Lime Pie no more with this recipe! I needed to make 100 slices of Key Lime Pie for a luncheon theater & I am so pleased that I chose this recipe! The pies set up beautifully, tasted delicious, and were very easy to prepare. Because of the volume of desserts I needed to serve, I did use a prepared graham cracker crust- But I used an extra large one ( 2 extra servings/each crust)and the quantity of pie filling was just right for the over sized crust. We topped each slice with whipped cream and sprinkled lime zest over that for a sassy service. It was so good, I made one for my own Memorial Day picnic at home!

This was a wonderful pie, very easy to make and it was gone in no time.  I will make again and will think twice before I order it when I go out b/c it is too easy to make at home!

I really enjoyed this recipie. It was the first key lime pie I had ever made.  I think next time to reduce the sweetness of the milk, I will only add 1 and 1/2 cans of milk and supplement the rest with eggs (not sure the ratio as of yet, but I think two eggs should work).  It was a knock out recipie!

This was my first time making a key lime pie, and it turned out AMAZING! I made homemade graham cracker crust and homemade whip cream to really make it shine. This pie had a perfect consistency and taste (not too sweet or tart) and was really easy to make. I'll be making this one again for sure!

A dessert this good should not be so easy to make. I used 2 cans of condensed milk and because I didn't have access to key limes, used half lime and half lemon juice as another reviewer suggested. I live in Ireland, so I made a crust from digestive biscuits rather than graham crackers. I chose the recipe because it looked simple and I could make it ahead, but my guests couldn't have been more appreciative if I'd slaved over it for hours. Nice creamy texture.

The only Key Lime Pie recipe I will ever use again!  Everything about this pie was great!  Easy to put together, quick to bake, tastes delicious, wonderful texture.  We do not have Key Limes available, so i used bottled Key Lime juice and rind from regular limes.  It still came out really good! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

So easy and easily the best key lime pie I've made at home.  I made it for my family at Christmas this past year and we all agreed that it was as good as any we got in the Keys.
