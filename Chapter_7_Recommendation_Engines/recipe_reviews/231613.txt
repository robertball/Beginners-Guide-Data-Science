These brownies were outstanding! Everyone at our family get together was raving about them! The texture is not that of a traditional brownie- they were very light and silky, almost mousse like. I think the beer cut down on the sugar as these weren't overly sweet, just a nice balance of sweetness. I will definitely be making these again!!!

Great recipe!  Unlike a lot of recipes with alcohol, I could actually taste the beer in these brownies and the flavor wasn't overwhelming.  Changes: I cut the sugar down by 1/4 cup (I generally do this in recipes); used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips instead of chopping 8 oz; and melted the chocolate in the microwave for 1 min, stirred, then 20 seconds more in the mic instead of the double boiler.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will mix the semisweet chocolate chips in so that there can be gooey chocolate bits throughout.

Made these this afternoon for a potluck, and they were devoured! I forgot to add the chocolate chips on top, but that didn't matter. For the powdered sugar, I put about 1/4 cup in a strainer, then tapped the strainer over the brownies to make a nice topping. Due to allergies, I left out the nuts. They weren't gooey at all, and they're more of a cake-like texture. The kids want me to make them again tomorrow!

I've made these brownies many times in the past 10 years.  I usually substitute Young's Double Chocolate Stout for the Guinness to "up" the chocolate level.  I even made these as an entry for a local chocolate festival contest and had many customers tell me they voted for me because they loved these brownies so much.

This recipe is so quick and easy! The brownies came out great! They are very rich and moist. I made a few changes due to lack of ingredients such as: using milk instead of beer, using walnuts instead of pecans, microwaving the butter and chocolate mixture, and not adding chocolate chips on top.  I had to bake it for around 45-50 minutes instead, but it tastes absolutely divine!

They were perfect! I added half a bag of Heathbar Crunch, but didn't notice them that much. I used a 9x9 pan. They were very thick, and took longer to cook, but were delicious. I also butter my pans, and use white sugar to dusk, instead of flour. It gives a sweeter, crunchier, more pleasing result than the taste of flour. They were more of a cake than a fudgier brownie, but he loved them, and they were for him. They are very rich with the additional chocolate chips on top. Again, I would do them without it, but "he" prefers them this way. It is nice to make something that comes out exactly as you had hoped.

Super sweet, super rich fudgy brownies! The chocolate seems strong enough that the beer taste doesn't show up as strong as thought it might.  When nothing but a chocolate fix will do, these are definitely the thing to serve!  Thanks for the recipe!

It was OK. The texture was too "cakey" and besides the actual chocolate chip topping, the brownies were not very sweet, to the point of being bland

These were great.  I replaced 1/2 cup of the morsels with the new cherry filled morsels and it made the brownies have a Black Forest flavor, well loved by the recipients.

I made it just as written and they are very good.  They are dense and fudgy.   I'm putting them in the fridge and will serve for dessert Saint Patrick's day with some ice cream.

The texture of these brownies is like that of a flourless torte.  A made the recipe without any modifications.  I thought they were great--my only complaint is that I wished a bit more of the flavor of the Guinness came through.

Brownies made with beer!!!!!
When I saw it I had to try it.
Skeptical up to the very end, I was sure these would be a bomb.
And, add to that, I'm not a big fan of brownies.
So when I say THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!!! 
Believe me.
Not too gooey, not too cakey,  a perfect in between.
And just sweet enough that you can still taste the chocolate.
I most definitely will be making these again.

So good! They aren't too sweet, and the Guinness is not overpowering within the mix. Perfect for eating while sipping a non-dark stout Irish beer or whiskey.

Superb - and a lovely  trick to turn for St. Pat's!   I had concerns putting that pan in the oven; the batter is quite "loose"; but the eggs did their job. I might substitute a merlot instead sometime...

These brownies have a dense, fudgy texture, a deep, dark chocolate flavor, and are not overly sweet. They're pretty quick to put together, and baked for me in about 22 minutes.

I had to beat my neighbors away with a stick for these.  The recipe turned out so well and the preparation was not very difficult at all.  I did not add Pecans( personal preference). Thank you for sharing this incredible recipe.

It's not an every day brownie, but it is worth it for special occasions when you want something a little special. I couldn't taste the beer at all. Mostly you will just taste chocolate.

Very disappointing.  Not nearly as good as something from a box.  Also concur w/ reviewers who stated:  this needed more salt, and this was very difficult without standing mixer.

The recipe NEEDS SALT!!  I made it, even adding a bit more salt than it called for and it was fudgy blah!  Came home form the party and sprinkled salt on a brownie and it came to life!!  The next time i make this I will add about 7/8 t. table salt, or a whole t. of kosher salt.   Maybe more.  It was a shame to waste all that chocolate and have so little real flavor. With salt, it is a 5 star recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is on the site.  I thought the little piece I had was good but maybe a waste of a good bottle of Guinness Extra Stout Import that I would enjoy in a glass; however, everyone else raved about them.
The deep, complex chocolate mix and the texture of these brownies drew plenty of attention and I will be making them again making sure that I get a full brownie.

Don’t know if it is because I’m in Colorado, but they were very very dry. But had an amazing flavor.

Outstanding recipe - the stout adds a deep, earthy layer to the flavor. I made these and they were gone in less than an hour. Definitely a keeper.

I realized after I made these brownies that I choose my receipes based on ingredients rather then process...I wanted this to be a perfect dessert for St Paddy’s day and it was just OK. I was excited about the addition of the Irish stout.  The ingredients were  expensive for me compared to box brownies.  I found it hard to physically make these brownies without a  stand alone mixer, which would have made it much easier. 
It was very rich and tasted more like a piece of fudge rather then a brownie.  None of my guests could eat more then a small sliver of dessert since it was so thick and rich.. However since I still have a good portion of the ingredients left I may secure some help and try it one more time. My brownies did not look like the picture!

I made exactly as written (except for the nuts, due to an allergy), and the brownies were excellent!  Perfect sweet ending to my savory Steak and Guinness Pie main dish for St. Patrick's Day!   With four different types of chocolate in the ingredients, these are a chocolate lover's dream (yet not too sweet).  I will definitely be making them again!

Although the recipe was not quick and easy, it was certainly worth the effort! These are decadent, creamy, rich brownies. This may become a St. Patrick's Day tradition for us.

I made these yesterday for a St. Patrick's Day Party.  The recipe was quite easy to follow.  I did not vary the recipe with the exception of using walnuts instead of pecans.  It  used about 3/4 of one of those tall cans of Guineness.  (Not to worry I finished off the can as I cleaned up. )  I didn't have a double boiler but used a covered skillet with about 2 inches of water---put all the chocolate and butter in a 2 cup measure and place the cover on top of the measure cup, stirring occasionally with a narrow spatula.   When the brownies came out of the  oven, they smelled soooo good....rich and chocolatey.    I cut the brownie pieces diagonally to make diamonds (about 1-1/2 inches) and placed them in muffin papers, then  dusted them with confectioners' sugar.  They were a HIT!!  I wouldn't serve them much larger as they are so rich and delicious.  I will definitely make them again.

While the prep is puttery, the results was awesome. I didn’t have any Guinness so I substituted a brown ale, and that worked just fine. Cut the pieces small as they brownies are rich and dense.

I baked the batter in muffin liners/pans and the serving size was too big.  These are super rich.  I mixed the semisweet chocolate into the batter, instead of dropping it on top.  If you love chocolate, this is an excellent recipe!  I used Guinness Extra Stout and could taste a hint of beer, but not much.  The dusting of confectioner's sugar is essential.

I can’t take the credit... my husband actually made it because I had a cold. But I “supervised”. The texture turned out amazing. It’s more like a fudge than a brownie. My pan may be a little smaller than 9x13 and therefore it took a little longer to bake. Maybe an extra 10 minutes (and we like our brownies under done so we should’ve baked them longer)   A little goes a long way. Small pieces are a must. It was VERY rich. All in all I liked it, but I’m more partial to a flourless torte. (But again, I did have a cold)

They’re awful.  Bitter tasting cake-like brownie that has no flavor to commend it.

I made these brownies two days in a row the first as a test batch in which I used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of a full cup of white sugar and because I only had one 4 oz bar of Ghiradhelli 60% cocoa I used a 4 oz bar of semi-sweet.  I also melted the butter and the chocolate in the microwave; much quicker and easier.  I mixed all the ingredients except the beer and the batter was pretty thick.  Then I added the beer and the mix became very wet and there was alot of extra liquid.  I didn't think all the liquid would absorb so I added a 1/2 c. of flour.  I also used whole wheat flour for the whole recipe.  I baked for 30 minutes and forgot to put the chips on top.  The brownies came out with a cake like consistency and they were ok probably should have only cooked them for 25 minutes.  The next night I made the recipe exactly written except for only using 1/2 c. of sugar and whole wheat flour.  The batter was again had alot of excess liquid and kind of slopped into the pan.  I cooked them first for 25 minutes but they middle was still uncooked and there was liquid in the corners of the pan so I put them back in for 10 more minutes and let cool for 30 minutes.  OMG!!!!  The chocolate flavor is intense and the consistency of the batter was more like fudge(very dense).  My husband, who is the king of brownie loving even commented on the chocolate flavor in the second batch.  I don't normally make brownies from scratch because I use Ghiradhelli box mix and they turn out really well

These brownies are absolutely amazing. I've made them several times and they've received rave reviews every time (and lots of requests for the recipe!). They're less sweet than most brownies and more like a flourless chocolate cake consistency. The first time I made them I thought four kinds of chocolate was a little much...but they come together to make the most INCREDIBLE dessert.

These were good and rich and gooey brownies.  We had just the right amount of leftover Rogue Double Chocolate Stout for this recipe.  We could taste the beer, but the flavor was nice.
