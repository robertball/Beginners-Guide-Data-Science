I've been searching for a tea that reminds me of a sugar cookie.  This is delightful.  I used Bigelow decaffeinated vanilla tea and it was perfect.  Thanks for this recipe!

This jazzed up my Sleepy Time Tea that I like to drink to wind down in the evening. I used stevia instead of sugar and heavy cream instead of milk, to make it low carb. Delicious little treat.

I used Earl Grey tea and it was yummy! Next time I'm gonna try to use cream instead of milk, and replace sugar with honey.

A most unusual tea. I used orange pekoe tea but think I would like this better using Earl Grey. The vanilla might be a bit much for my taste. I might cut it in half next time. The cinnamon collects in the bottom of the cup, so you have to be careful not to swallow it in that last drink.

I loved this! I love tea, and this is great on a cold day. It had the perfect flavour, but I found that the ground cinnamon made it a little bit grainy, and it was difficult to have the last sip because of it. But all in all, awesome recipe!
