Don't get me wrong, this was really good, but it is in no way a main dish meal.  The taste is a really subtle lemon flavor that won't over power anything.  I used mine under chicken scampi and it complimented the chicken really well.  
More importantly, it is super simplet to make.  However, I really felt that a pound of pasta was way too much as a side dish.  It says for four people, but we could have fed twice that many.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  When I first tried it, it was good, but tasted like it needed something, so I tried adding a sprinkle of parmesan...it was excellent!  Also, I did use fresh basil.

I made this for a main dish since I forgot to pull down any meat for dinner. This is very easy to make but I spruced it up with a little garlic salt and parmesan cheese. I bet this would go great with an italian type main dish such as chicken milano or something like that. I enjoyed it and the leftovers heated up well.... but again, if you plan to make this a maindish be sure to spruce it up with some other spices....otherwise you might think it's too bland. Thanks for posting Jane!

Tried twice.  First time was s0-s0.  The second time with modifications:2/3 c. olive oil, 2/3 c. parm cheese, 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/3 c. fresh chopped basil, 1 tbs lemon zest.  Heck, this is an entirely new recipe!  Whisk all the ingredients together and toss with Spaghetti.

This is a good light side dish for summer.  I halved the recipe and I think it could have used more of the lemon pepper sauce.  Next time I will make the full recipe of sauce for 4 oz. of pasta.

Light and refreshing, with the wonderful flavors and preparation for pasta that I grew up with and love.  I don't always use lemon juice, but it is SO nice here.  I used fresh basil rather than dried and a little minced garlic.  Perfectly flavored and perfectly "springlike."  Served this with "Pork Tenderloin Diane" and "Asparagus with Garlic and Onions," recipes also from this site.  This was an ideal, 5-star dinner to welcome the approach of spring.

I read all the reviews and from them created a composite recipe that turned out very well, and that I am now addicted to. I used angel hair and doubled the oil so it wouldn't stick. I cooked some garlic in the oil, used less basil, and added some lemon pepper and salt. It turned out very well!

I made some chagnes, and this turned out very good! I used fettucini for that pasta, I used butter instead of olive oil, and I used lemon pepper instead of just plain pepper. I didn't measure the lemon juice, just added as much as I thought would taste good. Yummy!

This was alright, I liked the lemon juice addition (com[ared to another recipe I have) but I think that lemon pepper is the best way to go with this one.  I also skipped the basil (which I thought to be a bit much) and added a tbsp. Mrs. Dash garlic basil tomato seasoning.  I also added some cooked broccoli & diced carrots for a nice side dish.  Thanks Jane.

Needed a quick side dish for a grocery store rotisserie chicken, and this looked great. I used butter instead of oil because.. well, butter is better than oil in everything. Didn't have straight basil, used italian seasoning instead. So good - oh, used bow-tie pasta to get the kids to eat it and they went nuts. NUTS.

I don't mind eating plain noodles...in fact I eat them pretty regularly.  My husband does not like this recipe.  He isn't that big of a plain noodle fan.  I don't think the recipe had enough flavor for the ingredients that were used.  I'm sorry but I don't think we will make this again.  Thanks anyway for the post.

This is a nice light side dish....with some changes.  I used half the amount of spaghetti called for in the recipe and also added 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, about 1 tsp of lemon pepper and 1/3 cup parmesan cheese.  Once the extra ingredients were added, this turned out to be a very nice side served with baked salmon.

Basil overkill! I would definitely recommend even less than the half I used, and possibly adding some garlic salt.

this was a great idea.  I used no egg noodles. I made salmon and haddock, this went well, with no cholesterol, a healthy filling side dish to a meal.  I added lemon pepper and a dash o parmesan.

My son and I both enjoyed this recipe. I added extra lemon juice and used lemon pepper. We also added shrimp and topped it with red pepper flakes and parmesan. It was very easy to prepare.

I made this for me and my boys for lunch and what a hit!  My picky 3-1/2 year old even went back for seconds!  I cut the pasta to a 1/2 lb of fettuccine because it was what I had on hand.  I kept all the other measurements the same and it had the perfect flavor.  I did use lemon pepper in place of the regular pepper per previous reviewers and added a dash of garlic and herb seasoning.  Next time I'm going to add a clove of garlic but otherwise make it the same.  Thank you Jane, this was a hit!

This is a good side dish.  Making it to the recipe was too plain.  By adding more olive oil and parm cheese, it makes a great side dish to fish.

This is a great recipe when you tweak it! There were several comments already that said that it was sour, I found that a little sugar helped this problem as well as a little salt! Also I found that adding garlic salt further enhanced the flavor. I 1/2 the basil because it was just to strong and decreased the lemon juice by 1T. I added onion, tomato, broccoli and cauliflower and it made a great dish to bring to my pot luck party!

As a side dish I'd rate this a four, as a main dish a two, so that's how I ended with a three! This recipe needs some work, so I halved the basil and that was plenty. I also added fresh romano cheese, garlic salt, a touch of salt, and Mrs. Dash Lemon pepper seasoning. It was pretty flavorful then. Eating this by itself got to be too much, but I think it would be excellent with some shrimp or chicken or as a side to beef. I wouldn't make it as a main dish again.

This is a fantastic and versatile side dish.  We ate it with seared scallops in wine sauce, but it would be good with just about any kind of meat that has a little sauce to it.  We used a good extra-virgin olive oil, fresh basil, and a decent dose of kosher salt with this (the salt is essential!)

This was a very interesting side dish, easy to prepare, very inexpensive, and something different from the same old pasta. I used 6 oz. angel hair pasta.  3 T of lemon pepper seasoning instead of the lemon juice and black pepper. It needed more olive oil as it soaked up all the oil very quickly and seemed a little dry. My family agreed it was okay, they would eat it again, but not a favorite.

Yummy!  I did add salt, and also some halved artichoke hearts that I needed to use up.  My husband would have liked it better with some anchovies and capers...next time, I guess.  Thanks!

This was a great side dish to go with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan also from this site.
I cut down on the lemon and used half regular olive oil and half garlic flavored olive oil. Will definitely keep in my recipe box.

I served this with cajun chicken and the flavors complimented each other well.  I did add some garlic salt, but very little. I could see where some people would prefer more salt though.  I will use this recipe again maybe next time I will add some fresh chopped plum tomatos.

I followed this recipe to the tee and we all thought it was pretty bland. It wasn't bad it just had no flavor really. I think it would probably be better if you used butter and dill with the lemon juice instead of basil and olive oil.

Good stuff. Bland, but perfectly balanced for the garlic lemon double stuffed chicken. Have it all with a glass of wine - food heaven.

Just okay. When I first made it, it was too bland. I made it again. and I had to increase the amount of lemon juice to spruce up the flavor. I also added minced garlic, lemon pepper, hot pepper flakes, 2 tbsp of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of heavy cream. Served with greek shrimp. Not sure I will make the pasta again.

These noodles were pretty good. It seemed like something was missing or the lemon was too strong. I think next time I will add parmesan cheese or a little less lemon, but will make again.

As one reviewer said, there is no way this would be a main dish. But it is a good base for a light and tasty chicken and pasta dish! First, I substituted lemon pepper for the ground black pepper. Then I added chicken, marinated in bottled lemon pepper marinade, grilled on the BBQ and cut into 1 inch cubes. I also added sauteed minced garlic and sliced green onions and added them to the pasta mix along with some baby peas. Now, it's fit for a main dish.

I agree with the other reviewers this is more a side dish.  I made it as a side dish for pan fried Talapia and it was a huge hit. I added the parmesan cheese at the end as suggusted and my husband love it!

Nice and easy recipe.  I used angle hair pasta for finer texture.  It absorbed the sauce very nicely.  This is definitely a keeper.

Very easy and tasty. I added a little more basil & lemon juice. Also minced fresh garlic, tiny pear tomatoes (sliced in half) & grated Asiago cheese on the finest setting (so it looks like snow). Tasty, healthy and looks pretty on the plate.

Thank you for the yummy recipe!

I loved this recipe!  It's a perfect side dish.  If you're looking for something light to eat with a main dish, this is perfect.  It's different than the usual.  I didn't measure anything, just made it perfect to my taste.

This was pretty bland.  After following the recipe exactly (except using only 10 oz. pasta) I tasted it, and it tasted like.... pasta.  So I added lemon pepper, and parmesan on top.  It was better this way.  We had this with Greek-Style Rib Eye Steaks, from this site, and it was a good thing to serve with that, since the steaks provided lots of flavor.

I made this as a side dish for the Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls also from this site submitted by Chompy. 

The only thing I added was Lemon Pepper and I used whole wheat thin spaghetti. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I think I'd like to try and add some grilled summer squash and zucchini. There was a subtle lemon flavor which my family appreciated. A great start for a variety of different dishes. Thanks Jane!

This was really quite tasty even though at first I had my doubts. I served it hot. I did add some garlic salt (about 1/2 tsp. for 2 servings). Served with some pork tenderloins & a salad.

I had to give this 3*s because as written, it was pretty bland. I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings (just me for lunch), decreasing the pasta & I used an olive oil pressed w/ lemons. Took  I'm Nuts Too's suggestion of using Mrs. Dash Tomato, Basil & Garlic seasoning instead of basil & topped it w/ parmesan cheese but it was still pretty bland so I added some lemon pepper as well as a bit of season-all salt. It was much improved but still only 4*s. It wsa good for lunch & it would make a good side pasta for many dishes....thanks Jane!

The flavor definitely has a good start.  I made it exactly as instructed and I agree with others that the olive oil wasn't enough.  Next time, I think I'll try the lemon pepper idea to bring out more flavor.

Yum. You definately have to enjoy eating plain pasta to like this. I didn't mind it and will probably use again as a side dish, but my husband is not a huge fan of pasta didn't care for it. It just tasted like cooked noodles to him.

This just wasnt that fabulous. I LOVE lemon but this was just to bitter. I cut the basil in half like others said to, but it just didnt cut it. I ended up having to add seasoned pepper and about 2 more tablespoons of olive oil. I will not be making this again for myself. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because my 17 month old loved it, and it was REALLY quick to make.

I'm afraid I didn't care much for this - it's not that it tasted bad, it was just extremely bland. I had to add a whole bunch of other ingrediants to this to make it acceptable to bring to the table...

Love this side dish! The first 2 times I made it I followed the recipe to a T. Tonight I decided to use orzo pasta & added parmesan on top  - so good! Thanks for sharing this light, summery recipe!

I read all reviews before beginning this. Most are the same, not enough flavor. Well I approached this like “Midnight Spaghetti”. I used the olive oil called for and added garlic. Then added the lemon juice, some lime margarita mix, and tossed in a ton of other spices and only made roughly 1/4 of the noodles as a trial though still made the amount of sauce as stated plus the pasta water etc. My advice..at least triple the sauce, add additional spices to taste, top with pepper, salt, crushed red pepper, and Parmesan cheese. Will definitely make again.

I made this and added more olive oil, minced garlic , Parmesan and lemon pepper seasoning and it turned out great. Good base, just have to tweak it to your liking.

Made this to go with the Grilled Lemon Chicken recipe by KRCTLC (which my family LOVES).  I found it to be a satisfactory compliment but not much flavor; my family found it "ok".  I might make it again, but it will need modifications.

Yuck.  Too much lemon.  I made this with a Lemon Pepper Salmon for my dad and we both like a hint of lemon.  This was like lemon explosion.  We tasted it and it was just bad :(

It wasn't fantastic but definitely good enough that I made it twice. It makes a fantastic side dish for chicken. First time I made it, I made a lemon pepper chicken breast and heat up some green beans. It was a perfect and filling meal. I will definitely be making this as a side again in the future as well.

I think this is good.  I didn't measure anything, just threw the ingredients together until I liked it, and it was done!  I added a little garlic powder (be careful on this because the flavor of the garlic comes on strong), Italian seasonings, and mixed butter and olive oil.  We added a little cooked broccoli and used it as a side dish.  I think I'll try zuchini and yellow squash next time - and there will be a next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe as the starting point to replicate a lemon pepper pasta I had while eating out at a restaurant.  While it didn't match the restaurant's dish well, it is a good place for me to start and tinker with.  This recipe easily livens up a simple pasta dinner--use this instead of buttering your pasta!

This didn't do a thing for me.I used roasted garlic olive oil. But I think butter would give it an improved flavor. It was better after Parm cheese was added.

As others have said, this is a really nice when served under chicken, but it is a bit bland on its own.  I wanted it for lunch the day after making the recipe as written, so to give it that "something extra" I added garlic, some sun-dried tomatoes I had to use up, and some parmesan cheese. those additions made it a great light lunch.  thanks for sharing this one!

My boyfriend and I both found this pasta kind of "blah" - we ate it, but won't be making it again.  The basil seems to overpower everything else, so unless you really like the basil flavor you might want to try something else.

I've made this a couple of times now, exactly as written. I've eaten it by itself, and as a main dish, it's pretty basic, but I'm sure that as a side dish it'd be a great complement to stronger flavored main dishes. The taste was okay when served hot, but I sort of preferred it served cold - it's kind of nice that way. The flavor's pretty mild, but the recipe overall is pretty easy to make. For what it is, I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars.

Great alone or topped with seasoned steamed broccoli. Used cayenne pepper (slightly smaller amount than recipe) instead of black pepper. I'll use a little less lemon next time so it's not so sour.

I tried this before adding garlic salt and parmesean cheese and thought it was a little bland. Next time, I will probably use butter so my daughter may enjoy it a little more. With my changes, it is a 5 star, but as written a 4.

As a side dish, this was simply not good... We salvaged this by topping with our CHICKEN SCARPARIELLO (from this site).  Mixing it was actually a winner - the sauce complemented it well.

While this dish (IMO) is not a 5 star recipe, it is certainly easy and will go nicely with a main dish that provides dominant flavouring.  Like other reviewers, I cut the pasta way down (for just the 2 of us, using Grain Wise whole grain spaghetti).  I too added lemon pepper seasoning and 2 cloves of minced garlic.  Also sprinkled with freshly grated parm at the end.  It did go quite nicely with steamed carrots and Asian Rainbow Trout (from this site - which is FAB)!

Tastes even better if refrigerated overnight.  A very lite and inexpensive dish to have at a BBQ.

This is a very nice lite pasta dish.  It's great because most of the ingredients you can have on hand.  Only thing I would do is probably make a 1/2 recipe more of the sauce.  Other than that my husband and I loved it and I will make it again!

After reading previous reviews I ended up making double the sauce, and I'm really glad I did as it was still kind of bland.  I used about 1 T. lemon pepper as others had suggested, but as I'm a big fan of black pepper I think I may have preferred to use just that or half black pepper and half lemon pepper.

This would make a nice complement to a more fragrant main dish, like lemon chicken or fish, but it's pretty boring to serve alone.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 is because my 2 and 4 year old LOVED it.  They ate it as a main dish and kept asking for more, and in my book that's worth an extra star for kid-friendly.

Pasta dish went very good with Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls (On this site). Doesn't taste good after microwaving! Added double the sauce mixture as well.
Will make again!

I made this as a side dish to go with grilled salmon with a balsamic glaze so I wanted something light that would not overpower my main dish. I personally thought it was slightly bland but my other six dinner guests loved it went for seconds. It ws very light and I will probably make it again.

Yummy! I used 1/2 a pound of pasta, with all the sauce. I realized halfway into this dish that I was out of basil, so I had to substitute thyme instead. Very good!

It actually deserves a 4.5.  The pasta was a touch dry. I cut the dried basil to 1 teaspoon.  I substituted 1 teaspoon lemon pepper for the ground black pepper (as suggested by others), added 1 teaspoon garlic salt, and 1/3 cup parmesan. Great side dish for the chicken we had for dinner.

This was just too bland. I only used a 1/4 of the ingredients because I was cooking for two, and wound up throwing out half of it. I might try this again but only with modifications.

Very good.  Would be better as a side dish than a main dish, I think.  Although, it would be great for a summer entree as it is nice and light tasting.  I doubled the amount of sauce to put on the pasta, and served with parmasean.  I also used lemon pepper instead of normal pepper, as others have suggested.  It gave it more of a punch.

This was a good side dish....however it was a little strong in the basil area.  I served it hot a dinner but at lunch i served it like a salad and it was way better cold than hot.  So that is why it has four stars...because it was salvagable by having it for a salad.

This was a great recipe for a side dish.  It would go well with chicken or fish.  I would suggest only a half a pack of noodles though.  That's what I used and it turned out very nice.

I tried this with a lemon pepper-marinated chicken breast. It didn't really suit us (myself, husband, and a dinner guest). It lacked a lot of flavor, and just wasn't something we enjoyed. The lemon almost made it too bitter. I compensated by trying to add extra olive oil, but it still didn't help us enough to actually enjoy it. We halved the basil, because it just seemed like too much! I don't recommend this dish.

This was a good quick and easy dish i made for dinner tonight- my parents and brothers loved it.  I just added some cut up chicken thighs, zuchinis, and green onions that i sauteed in the same marinade and it made this into a great meal.

I cut up some chicken and cooked it with a little lemon pepper and tossed it with the pasta. It made a great very quick dinner. And kids love it.

I wish you could rate a recipe with zero stars.  This was awful.  We each tried a noodle and then made baked potatoes instead of eating this.

I made this w/ angel hair pasta and think that was best as the flavor is a bit delicate.  I spruced it up a bit w/ some onion and garlic powder and a little salt.  It was delitefully refreshing and light tasting.  It was great that way but would definately compliment a chicken or seafood dish nicely.
