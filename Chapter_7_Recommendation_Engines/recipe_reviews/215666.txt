This was fantastic!  I feel I have an edge on the city dwellers though as I was able to use fresh shell beans and cucumbers  from the garden and locally produced maple syrup.  I really miss living in the city and know that this dish would be just as good with any kind of canned beans if you can't get fresh at the farmers market over in Union Square (if they still have it there).  Thanks for a great salad recipe!

I was a bit disappointed in this. The dressing was very good, but to me it just didn't complement the fava beans (I used garden-fresh favas and romas). I'm glad I tried this recipe, but I'll keep looking for something to use with all the beans coming from my garden.

This salad is amazing! I didn't have fava beans so I used a medley of what I had and it was delicious! Thank you

I was looking for a simple but tasty dressing for a bean medley salad. This was amazing. I added some salt and it seemed to help the flavours come out more.

I doubled this recipe, which I looked up mainly for the vegan dressing.  My photo shows how I enlarged the recipe with other beans and peppers, plus parsley and cilantro from my winter garden.

It was a colorful and welcome vegan addition to a Thanksgiving feast.  Will make again.  The touch of maple syrup in the dressings is just right.

The dressing is very good!  I also used what I had on hand...garbanzo beans, black eyed peas.  Also added some tomatoes & green pepper.  I think a couple of slices of cooked bacon would be good in this salad (sorry vegans!).

This was very good.  I really liked the dressing.  Even my 2 year old liked the salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

wonderful! couldn't find fava beans so used butter beans and northern beans and rinsed them off before adding to salad.

I used cannelini beans, for a lack of fava beans, and I also cut the onion by half, because my onion was HUGE! I used de seeded regular tomatoes, because I was out of romas, as well. I added a tiny bit of salt, to help bring out some of the flavors. I think the dressing compliments the beans and the veggies quite nicely. I subbed agave for the maple syrup as well. I used half of a giant cucumber, and next time will use the whole thing. I am eating this as we speak, before even letting it sit, because it is that good. I can't wait to have this at lunch break tonight!
