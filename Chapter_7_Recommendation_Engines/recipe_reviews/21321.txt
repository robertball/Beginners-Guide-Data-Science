This was great. although i did it a bit different. i used about a half lb of the next size down shrimp without tails. i didnt bother to slice them. i mixed up the ingredients, let them sit in it for a bit then broiled them in the oven. was delicious mixed in with my fettucinni alfredo. will make again. thanx.

This was really good, but I did do a few things differently.  I added just a bit of chicken stock and some lemon juice.  It made the butter sauce a bit thicker and stick to the shrimp better.  It tasted great and I know I will be making this again. Thanks for posting.

Four stars as written, but I felt it could use the addition of  fresh, minced parsley, fresh lemon juice, and salt and pepper.  I used all olive oil, no butter, as I marinated the shrimp for about an hour and a half before broiling them for just 2-3 minutes per side.  Excellent, light seasoning, perfect for the delicately flavored shrimp. I served this over "Lemony Caesar Salad," also from this site.

Delicious! I added salt and pepper to taste, chopped up some fresh parsley from my garden and let the shrimp marinate for about 30 min. Before grilling I skewered the shrimp, after grilling I poured extra butter/garlic over the shrimp and Voila! happy family :)  Thanks Nessy.

Fantastic!--I increased the amount of garlic, coarsely chopped it (versus mincing it) and let the shrimp marinate in it for a little while before grilling.

This was great! I used my George Foreman to grill these and it was done in 2-3 minutes tops! The only thing I did different was toss the shrimp in the coating instead of brushing it on. I put them on the grill and then spooned the remaining herbs and sauce over the shrimp. It wasn't as buttery tasting as I hoped it would be but wow! The flavour was great because the grill sorta pressed the herbs onto the shrimp so it stuck nicely. I served with Spaghetti Olio (from this site) so it wouldn't take away from the flavour of the shrimp, the combination was perfect! Thanks!

This is a very easy and quick recipe that adds subtle flavor to the shrimp.  Although I felt it could use a little more jazz, I appreciate that the garlic  didnâ€™t overpower the shrimp flavor at all.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but I followed this recipe word for word, and when I basted my butter/garlic sauce on the shrimp, the drppings caught fire and ruined the shrimp. They were totally charred and inedible. Too bad, cuz until they went up in a giant shrimp inferno, they smelled pretty good...

Great and simple recipe.  I sauteed the shrimp in the sauce since I don't have a grill and it turned out really well. Put shrimp over linguine and topped with some parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make this again!!!

Another winner and an excellent way to make Scampi quickly. I used the tip for marinating the shrimp (used part of the sauce in a baggie); I also added white pepper, dried parsley, and chives along with a LOT of garlic: chopped, ground, powder, pepper - well actually a little of each. Can't have TOO much garlic in Scampi, right? I used my Geo Forman grill inside. I will prepare this dish again.

Very easy to make and quite tasty...could use a bit more spice to it, however.
