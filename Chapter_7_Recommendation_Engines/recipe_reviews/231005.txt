I made these in my Showtime Rotisserie (about 1 1/2 hours). Divine! I don't use garlic salt so I swapped that for garlic powder. One tablespoon of Kosher salt was plenty. I ground the fennel seeds in my mortar as done in the video. The recipe doesn't mention this. I used Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce, which is HOT, but the heat balanced out nicely with the sweetness of the sugar and orange juice. Everyone loved these, and they didn't last long!

These are sticky and spicy tasty bites.  The recipe does not state to crush the fennel seeds - I don't like whole fennel seed so I crushed mine and then watched the video to see Chef John crushing the fennel.  As for the cooking method, it left the ribs a little drier than we like.  Next time I would season them and double wrap in foil and cook low and slow as directed - then glaze and finish in the oven or on the grill.  Overall, very good flavor, a little on the spicy side.  Watch the amount of chili paste if you don't want them too spicy.

It does have the flavor of sausage.  We loved it.  I used all the ingredients as stated except for the amount of glaze.  I was only making one rack of ribs but I  made enough glaze for 2 racks and I am glad I did.  I never would have had enough if I had cut that in half.  The rub being cut in half for the 1 rack was fine.  This is a keeper.  Can't wait to try it on friends to see the expression on their faces when they taste it.  Thank you submitter.

we really enjoyed this but felt like the sauce overpowered the sausage flavor.. i suggested to bf making the sauce again and using it on chicken wings.. he agreed.. i used sriracha for the chile garlic sauce and added some pinot grigio as i reduced the sauce a little too much.. still tasted great.. ty for the recipe

OMG these are so good! My fiancé loved these! I thought the orange glaze would be odd but it's perfect with the fennel. The only complaint I have is that the ribs were a tad bit dry. I'll do as another reviewer suggested & cover the ribs with foil while they cook for the first 1 1/2 hours. I served the ribs with twice baked potatoes & a green salad. Comfort food!

These are awesome, just the way Chef John posted them. The only deviation I made was that I couldn't find hot chili paste, so I substituted chili garlic sauce. I've already made it twice in the last 2 months and have ribs waiting that I bought last night. Thanks for the recipe Chef.

This recipe is a cracker! Huge success on first try - family loved it and the ribs went fast! Followed the instructions diligently - used a little more cayenne pepper than suggested - it was delicious! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe - our July 4th gathering was a blast.

I made this for everyone out and the lake and it was a hit. I only made the recipe with half the chili paste for the kids, but still delicious. If you like a saucier rib (as I do), I would suggest making 1.5 - 2 times the glaze. Will definitely make again with extra glaze!
