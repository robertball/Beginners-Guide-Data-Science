This is really good.  The curry really works with the squash and all of the ingredients together are quite tasty.  I used 1/2 pound do shrimp which is just slightly more than the 3/4 c than the recipe calls for.  I also used Tuscan herb olive oil which added to the flavor.  Definitely give it a try!

I loved this recipe that uses my favorite squash! I liked how the curry worked so well with the squash and shrimp. I thought it needed a bit of creaminess to distribute the flavors, so added about 2-3 tbs sour cream once the veggies and shrimp were off the heat.

This was fantastic!  I did a couple of changes- baked the squash in the oven because I had it on for something else. Also I didn't have shrimp so I left it off. I will definitely make this again!!
