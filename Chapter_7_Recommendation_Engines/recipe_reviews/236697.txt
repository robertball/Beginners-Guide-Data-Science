Made this today. Probably won't get 6 servings out of it. All in all, it was very good. About the only changes I made were, I browned the beef cubes before dumping them into the crock and I was afraid that it was going to be too dry so, I added a 480ml container of beef broth. In hindsight, I most likely didn't need to add the broth, as there seems to be a lot of liquid left over, but, I notice that another poster also added beef broth. Actually, I intend to freeze the leftover liquid and use as gravy? some other time. Will most definitely be making this again.

I made this yesterday, it was the best beef stew ever!!!!  I added 32 oz of beef broth, and added a whole 15oz can of tomato sauce, because I didn't want to waste it.  I put in some celery also.  I used the beefy onion soup mix, because that is what I had.  I cooked it for 4 hrs. on high!  Everyone loved it!  Added alittle water with some corn starch for thickening, because of the extra liquid & it came out perfect!  Today, I added more potatoes & carrots and we finished it today!  Will make this recipe a go to one for Beef Stew!!!!

I really like this recipe - it is a great base stew and not too soupy - which is very important in our house.  Based on other reviews and feedback from my family, I have modified it over time to the following:  I brown the meat and substitute celery for the onion (I keep the onion soup mix).  I use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, add 2 tablespoons worchestershire sauce and 1 beef boullion dissolved in 1 cup boiling water.   Enjoy!

This is indeed easy and hearty.  I added Lawry's season salt, garlic powder and one can of mushrooms.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used one can of diced tomatoes.  I thought the flavors were very good.  The key to the whole thing is the mushroom soup.  Very good.  The next time I make this I will add more beef.  This is a keeper.

Stuck to the recipe more or less. Used bottom round roast and added  a Coleman's beef bourguignon sachet and on low for 6 hrs in a slow crock pot.........Perfect!

I made this today for dinner. Easy and yummy! It only took me about 30 minutes prep time.  I browned the stew meat (about 3 lbs) prior to adding it to the slow cooker. I also altered the recipe by adding  mushrooms,  a rutabaga, about a tablespoon of worchestershire, and approx. 1/3 c. red wine, 1/3 c. beef broth and about 1/2 c. of beef gravy. The original recipe broth to meat and vegetable ratio was good, but since I added ingredients I wanted to increase the broth. I liked my additions. Very yummy. I will make this again soon. I'm sure the recipe would have been great as is. I think the cream of mushroom soup tomato sauce and onion soup mix are a winning combination. Thank you!!!

Absolutely delicious. I browned the beef first though and instead of using dried parsley I used fresh. It turned out great and my family fell in love with it. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Made this tonight. It turned out great! Really easy to throw together, took about 20 mins. Cooked on high for 4.5 hours on high. This is too easy not to make again! Added mushrooms and celery and cut back on the carrots too. Just our personal preference.

I made the beef stew without the mushroom soup and it was perfect.  This was my first time creating a great stew.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was very good, I added probaby about 1 1/2 cups or 2 of water. Tastes a tad better using Golden Mushroom instead of the Cream of Mushroom Soup.

I replaced the onion dry soup mix with Knorr vegetable soup mix, the one used for spinach dip. Then I added 8 ounces of babybella mushrooms sliced thick.  It came out awesome.

This was just okay to me. My family agreed. I felt it lacked flavor. The meat was delicious and I did 1.5lbs of lean stew meat. If I make again, I will add at least another pound of meat. Also, I used 15oz of organic tomato sauce and added a can of cream of chicken, along with cream of celery. Without the addition of liquid, it wouldn’t have been a stew. I used organic Idaho russet potatoes—wouldn’t recommend. I’ll do gold potatoes, if making again. I browned the beef beforehand with olive oil, Himalayan salt, onion powder and garlic powder. Again, the meat was the best part. I also added a beef bullion cube to the stew. To go with it, we had cottage cheese and biscuits. The stew smelled so good in the crockpot all day, so I was seriously disappointed after tasting. Maybe, better luck next time??

A very delicious recipe, I added one cup of frozen mixed vegetables to the recipe and use an 18 ounce of creamed mushroom soup. It was thick but very tasty and yielded enough for four good size portions. Would definitely make this one again. Served with a side of bread !

This stew is really good. I made it following the recipe and the only change I will make next time is to cut the tomato sauce in half and add some beef bouillon as we prefer a little more of a beef broth rather than tomato. Great easy recipe!

This stew was spot on.  My husband told me this was the best stew he has ever had.  The only changes I made was I added 16oz of tomato sauce.  I also added 1 cup of beef broth.  This will be a staple in my house!

I made this, but instead of cutting up the beef, I made it like a pot roast. When I was putting the ingredients into the crockpot I didn’t think the liquid would be enough. But it was. Came out fantastic.

Absolutely loved it! Only change I made is I added celery. :) My only complaint is even after it was supposed to be done, my veggies weren't as soft as I would have liked them to be but it was still amazing and a huge hit! :)

Easy and yummy. Followed the recipe. Didn’t use the beef broth some reviewers suggested. There is plenty of liquid following the recipe. Next time I’d add peas and maybe mushrooms. Barley would be good in this too.

This was great and so easy! Based on other reviews, I did add some beef stock and some red wine. I also through in some frozen peas. Turned out great and the whole family loved it! Thanks!

Great winter meal, hearty and satisfying. I added peas and corn because I had them already to go. I used whole pearl onions too, delicious. Will absolutely make again.

I made this recipe twice. Definitely great comfort food. The first time I made this stew, I followed the recipe to the tee and it came out a bit too thick and too spicy for my taste. The second time I made it, I made two changes.
I added 1 cup of 50% reduced sodium beef stock (I started out adding a 1/2 cup of beef stock, but wind up adding a cup). the other was that I reduced the amount of Black pepper by half (1/4 tsp). Both changes made this recipe better for me. I'd make it again, but my way.

It SMELLS like beef stew ????!  I wanted a little pep to it, so I added a small can (or two ??) of sliced jalapeño.  This recipe is a perfect beef stew starter.

Pretty good. My husband loved it. Made it mostly the same except was out of cream of mushroom and used a golden mushroom soup. Easy to make.

My first attempt at cooking this turned out great. I added less potatoes than the recipe asked for & added in one carton of mushrooms. I also added about 1-1.5 cups of liquid to the sauce before pouring it over everything which resulted in a thick but runny sauce at the end. The next time I cook this I'll definitely sear the beef so the pieces have more flavor to them. Overall this dish is great & easy to customize.

I used tomato paste instead of sauce, used 2 pkgs of dry onion soup, stew meat seasoned with salt , pepper, and lightly floured before placing in crock pot to give  a hearty gravy consistency. Added Worcestershire approx 4 T.

This stew is so good! I added 3 stalks of celery but other then that I stayed true to the recipe for the most part. It's so easy and has a very quick prep time. So far I've only had it by it's self which is great but it tastes like it'd be good on pasta or rice. I think I'm gonna make a big pot of this one day and take it over to my neighbors. Then everyone will love me and tell me they like it. : )
