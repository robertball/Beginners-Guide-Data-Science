These tomatoes are fantastic!! A great way to use winter tomatoes, they become very sweet and tasty when roasted. Sometimes I only use 2-3 cloves of garlic and place the slices between the tomatoes in the roasting dish. Also I use dried basil if I don't have fresh on hand. I usually roast them the night before and put them in the fridge. Then the next day I chop them up and heat them up and mix with hot pasta, then sprinkle with romano cheese - Delicious!

I loved this! I just pushed thick slivers of garlic right into the tomato halves. I think these would be incredible with some slices of really good mozzerella melted on top. Also, I am going to make a large panfull of these, dice them up and freeze to use in pasta sauce. The flavor is just outstanding. Thanks so much, Allie!

Yummy! Instead of whole garlic cloves inserted between the tomatoes, I simply used jarred fresh minced garlic spooned on top of the tomatoes. Great with grilled ribeyes.

Serving this on the dinner plate was like completing your outfit with accessories!  So pretty and really adds a little color and verve.  Rather than using the whole cloves of garlic I just sprinkled on a little minced garlic on each of the tomato halves. Because I needed this to share the oven with the fish I was making, I roasted these at 425 degrees for 25 minutes and it was perfect. This was fresh and flavorful, a far cry from the stewed tomatoes with croutons I remember as a kid!

Loved it! With the garlic cloves(lots), I tucked  button mushrooms in between the tomatoes. Grated mozzerella on top for last 10 minutes. Served it at a luncheon, on a bed of lettuce with dollops of cottage cheese around. Looked & tasted great !
A keeper...thanks !

In a word - FABULOUS!!  I have made these three times now, and each time they have been great.  The first time I made as written and served as a side dish.  The second and third times I used grape tomatoes, minced garlic and just a little oil, lots of fresh black pepper and salt to taste.  Fresh basil is key on this one.  Tossed everything together and roasted.  Used in a panini sandwich - wonderful, but a little messy.  Last night we used these to top a white pizza - YUM!

I was wanting to make some roasted tomatoes after seeing a similar recipe on 5 Ingredient Fix on the Food Network.  So glad I found this incredibly EASY recipe.  I don't why, but sometimes the simplest things just really hit the spot.  No need for tons of vinegars and fancy wines all the time.  I changed the method a bit.  I minced the garlic, stirred it in wit the olive oil and just let it 'hang out' for a while so the flavors could infuse.  I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I just took about 1/2 tsp. of dried and mixed in the oil and garlic.  I then too the tomato halves and gently tossed them with the oil mixture in a plastic bag and then poured into a shallow glass pie dish, making sure to turn the cut side up.  Then I seasoned with sale and fresh black pepper.  I don't think I needed to roast mine the full time, and they came out super yummy!

Outstanding flavor with most tomato varieties!  Have made this numerous times with different kinds of tomatoes.  This time I used small Campari tomatoes (larger than Cherry, but smaller than Plum). Placed tomato halves (seeds side up) on jelly roll pan lined with non-stick foil.  Placed torn pieces of fresh basil leaves on each tomato half. Sliced medium yellow onion and only 5 cloves of crushed garlic cloves then tossed in with tomato halves. Olive oil prinkled liberally over tomatoes, onions and garlic.  400 degree pre-heated oven for only 30 minutes.

Maybe someone can give me suggestions.  I didn't use Roma tomatoes, but I had some "Campari" tomatoes on hand, which are in between Roma and Cherry tomatoes.  Do you seed your tomatoes before you roast them?  Mine came out of the oven with a ton of liquid on the bottom of the pan.  I still thought they were quite good.

Oh my goodness.  Instant favorite.  So good!  The only thing I disagree with is the idea that this could possibly serve four.  Haha!  I made a double batch and my other half and I demolished all but three halves.  Roasting the tomatoes makes them like tomato candy.

Awesome!I had 5 roma tomatoes that I halved. I put them onto a parchment paper which was on a baking sheet. easy clean up for me. I then cut some garlic cloves in half and dropped them onto the roma tomatoe. I also put some garlic slivers into the tomatoes. I added a handful of fresh chopped basil, little rock salt, fresh black pepper. I drizzled a little olive oil over the tomatoes and baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Wonderfully sweet and fresh. The tomatoes were soften, juicy and so pretty with fresh green basil sprinkled all over. I'll be using this recipe for pasta sauces, and other dishes that call for tomatoes. Love this recipe. Ali thank you for sharing.

Good simple flavor.  I added parmasan cheese on top after I pulled them out of the oven.  Also I scooped the seeds and gel out before baking.

This is such a great, light recipe. The only change I made was that I chopped the garlic cloves to get as much flavor from the garlic as I could. It was delicious. You can add various other items to this dish to please your taste buds. This one is a keeper. Thanks so much

This was great, although I roasted them at about 300 degrees for 60 minutes and toped with Gouda cheese in the last 5 minutes. The family loved them for mother's day.

I've made this a few times now for my family, which tends to get stuck in recipe ruts, and they love it! I like to chop/crush fresh basil from my garden and sprinkle it on with hand minced garlic and coarsely ground sea salt. Delish!

i have been doing roasted tomatoes for a long time. i use romas exclusively. the only thing i do different is a drizzle with good balsamic vinegar. i also use minced garlic rather than cloves. and finally be sure to sprinkle them with some sugar.

I have made and enjoyed these for years.  I also have made additions as some other users have mentioned.  For the person who said they had a lot of juice left in the pan... try cooking cedar plank salmon, etc., or poaching a piece of fish & then drizzle the pan juices over the fish.  So good, it makes you want to slap yo mama!

These are great. I skipped the fresh basil and used shallots to add extra garlic/onion flavor to these. The tomatoes are the perfect for a veggie sandwich!

Yum! These are so easy and so delicious. I served it as a side dish with chicken and rice and it was just the burst of color and flavor we needed. I used crushed garlic which I rubbed into the tomatoes, and dried basil.

Added kalamata olives and jarred roasted peppers and artichoke hearts (all my favorites).  Wonderful, so glad I found the original recipe.  Thank you, Ali.

Make these all the time.  However, I toss all ingredients in a bowl, add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, a pinch of sea salt and a few grinds of fresh black pepper.  Have also added thyme.  Can be used with any fresh or dried herbs one may have on hand.  Excellent basic recipe.  Experiment with different combinations.  Also excellent served on grilled baguette - fun and easy party appetizer.  As others have mentioned, can also make a wonderful fresh pasta toss.

I was very liberal with the olive oil.  AFter roasting, I cooled them then pureed them in the food processor.  Added some more fresh italian herbs from the garden and tossed it over pasta!

I added Italian seasoning because I didn't have basil at hand and it was great. I didn't really get how placing the garlic in the pan worked so I wedged them right into the tomatoes and it was great.

Delicious. My tomatoes and garlic were perfectly roasted in 40 minutes. A big hit with my oldest son. I think cheese would be a nice addition, but these are also really nice and fresh-tasting without it. Thanks!

This has become a new holiday favorite around my house.  My sister's a vegetarian, so anything I can make that's simple for her is great.  The only thing I do differently is add a little mozzarella cheese just before I take it out of the oven.

This was absoutely FANTASTIC! What a great way to use the extra Roma's from my garden before they go bad. Very very very easy and very very very tasty. I added a couple slices of red onion to the dish. Then added parmesan cheese right before serving. If you like fresh tomatoes you will LOVE this!

Try putting the tomato into yellow bell peppers with the garlic tucked in around them. The Red and yellow looks really nice.

My vegan friend loved these, but I think they required a little doctoring--it's best with a bit more salt and some extra spices.

I diced these tomatoes up and added an onion as well for the purpose of adding it to onion spaghetti (from this site) that I make regularly. It never made it to the spaghetti as my son ate half and boyfriend the other half before I got to. Both raving about how delicious it was. Going to make again soon and maybe next time I’ll get to use it for the spaghetti. Thanks for an instant hit.

Simple and delicious! Somehow with the fragrant aroma, and using tomato, basil and garlic, I imagine eating pizza, without all the loaded extra carbs and calories. It's also great to dip fresh French Bread into the warm olive oil in the dish. This recipe is a new favorite of my friends and family.

I make mine the same way. I usually do a large amount at a time and freeze the leftovers.  I don't put the basil on until I'm ready to serve it. My favorite way to use them is mixed with pasta and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.

Perfect!  Used dried basil and served as a side with baked fish in foil.

These were pretty good. I didn't have fresh basil so I used a combination of dried basil and dried oregano.

These were excellent.  I used this recipe to make roasted tomatoes to use in the recipe "Fire Roasted Tomato and Spinach Pasta" from this site.

I don't understand what the big deal is.  I wasn't blown away by this recipe either.  Sorry.

This makes a very tasty side-dish to serve with lasagna, or other Italian dishes. Super simple to make: takes about 5 minutes to prepare. Watch the tomatoes carefully near the end of their cooking so they get dried out. I like to sprinkle a small amount of parmesan cheese on them near the end of baking. The full cloves of garlic are really tasty: just don't eat this on a weeknight if you have a meeting to attend in the morning!

This was ok and very simple ... I wasn't completely blown away.  I love tomatoes so of course I thought it was good, but didn't think it was unbelievable.

These smelled so good while they were roasting.  They went really well with grilled London Broil and macaroni and cheese.
