I made it exactly as written, with the exception of halving it, since I was the only one that would be eating it. Next time, I think I will use a little less ginger, just because the it was a little stronger than I like.  All in all good and different from regular Cole slaw. I especially liked that sweet tart contrast of the mango.

Delicious! Will definitely make again! A great alternative to boring regular coleslaw
