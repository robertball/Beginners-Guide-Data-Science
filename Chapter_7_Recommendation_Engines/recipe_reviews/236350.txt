This recipe was mediocre at best. I used only 8 ounces of pasta and that was plenty in proportion to the rest of the ingredients. I marinated the ribs for 24 hours, upped the fresh rosemary to two sprigs and added desperately needed salt after baking. While I was sadly disappointed by this recipe, my husband thought it was just o.k. He suggested adding sun-dried tomatoes, which I will do on the reheat for lunches. Love the campanelle pasta, just not the recipe. Thank you, Barilla, for your fine products!

A nice change of pace. I cooked my ribs on the grill in a lipped baking sheet covered in foil for 3 hours at a low low temp, then added the wine and cooked another hour covered. The ribs feel right off the bone. I liked the color the purple cabbage added to the dish. This would be a great way to us up leftover ribs after a BBQ.

Started with the best quality ingredients: Imported Parmesan cheese, Colavita EVOO and Barilla Pasta. Also used country style ribs, marinated overnight in fresh Rosemary. The cabbage turned a pretty shade of green when it was cooked. If you don't care for or can't eat pork, lamb would work well and taste nice with this pasta. I really like this recipe. It's a definite five-star recipe.

We had to make a lot of adjustments to make this work for us, but it turned out delicious! I made the marinade as stated but added salt to the chops. Before i baked the pork I seasoned it with essence. I halved the pasta as someone else suggested. For the sauce I doubled the garlic, added half of an onion sliced, and also added about 1/2 c more wine. When the pork was done I also added those pan juices to the sauce. I omitted the butter mainly because I forgot. Oh well, it didn't need it and neither did we! Ha!

My husband does not eat pork so I took Cynthia Ross' suggestion and used lamb.  It was delicious.  My husband thought it was good. I liked the cabbage and pasta element.I will probably use this recipe again in the future.   Thanks for the recipe!

A little extra work but this is worth it.  I substituted boneless pork loin for the ribs.  Used the same cooking method. I also used freshly grated Parmesan cheese in place of Parmigiano-Reggiano, worked fine.  I also added the residual wine from the roasting pan into the sauce to add more flavor, worked very well! This is very good and we will probably have this again!

Not something I would normally prepare for dinner, but it was quite good.  I used bone in pork ribs and just cook them 30 min @ the higher temp and 20 at the lower temp and then sliced the meat into the cabbage.  I could not find the campanelle, so I used Rigatoni I had on hand, using 1/2 the amount listed in recipe.

This is a really nice recipe. Different and we loved pasta and cabbage! Could use a little more herbs but all around a definite keeper! I haven't made Barilla Campanelle in a long time and its such a great texture and shape I will be making again and again.

Tried this on the family. Some loved it and some were so so.  It would be easy to add some more to spice this up.  Great taste.

I've made this a few times.  The flavors are mild and the texture is good.  I, also add the pan drippings to the sauce.  The family loves it. I only gave 4 stars because the campanelle is so hard to find.

I made this for our family dinner night so everyone was there to try it.  It was really good.  I thought it was a lot of work getting all the meat off the rib bones but we all liked it and it was tasty.  It would be nice if it was a little more colorful though I think.  All in all it was not hard and everyone liked it.  I added some alfredo to the leftovers and heated, it was good also.
