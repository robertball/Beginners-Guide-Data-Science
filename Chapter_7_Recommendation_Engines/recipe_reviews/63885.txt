These are wonderful.  The only thing that I did differently was instead of adding the cooking water, I added milk.  I just like the consistencey and taste much better that way.  Thank you...these were delicious.

I made so many mistakes when making these, and they still turned out!  1.  I didn't realize I was almost out of taters, so I had to use what was left: 1 small russet, 2 small Yukon Golds and 2 mediums Reds.  2.  I forgot to roast the garlic, so I just boiled it with the potatoes.  3.  I forgot to add the boulion, but sprinkled some powdered stuff on after cooking.  4.  Forgot to soften cream cheese, so I had to use some of the spreadable stuff from the fridge but there were probably only 2 tabelspoons left.  With all my mistakes, this could have been a big disaster, but they were still yummy!  Can't wait to try them again the right way!

Sad that this is listed under "low carb:side dishes" because potatoes are not low carb. I was thinking there would be a secret replacement ingredient that would replace the potatoes to make it seem potato-ish but be low carb. Nope. So, as fabulous as this sounds, it won't be going on my table.

This was a good recipe.  I made a few changes though.  I used powdered garlic, milk instead of the boiled water, salt instead of chicken flavored bouillon and more cream cheese than the recipe called for.  I will use this recipe again.  Just prefer the traditional method.  Oh, I also left the skins on the potatoes.

Wow, fantastic recipe that my garlic lovin' crew really liked!  Hey "Ronbrownlaw", did you by chance not roast the garlic first? Roasting takes the bite out and leaves you with a mild and sweet tasting garlic.

Yummmo! These are by far the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted. I used an 8 oz. brick of cream cheese and added a few splashes of milk to give the potatoes a creamier texture because they seemed a little too dry. Huge hit!

These were fantastic! We used the leftovers for potato pancakes the next morning.  Added 1 egg & 1/4 cup flour with 4 cups of potatos & fry.  Absolutely fabulous!  ***UPDATE*** I have made these several times since my initial review.  I have to say that they are not completely foolproof. Although still delicious, a few times they turned out gummy.  I'm not sure what causes this sometimes & not others.  The potatoes maybe?

Probably the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  I didn't have regular garlic so I used a big slice of elephant garlic instead.  I didn't want to take the time to bake the garlic so I put it in the microwave until it was soft (30 sec) then cut up into tiny pieces.  I also put in a large tablespoon of horseradish sause to give it a little kick.  Excellent!!

One word: Awesome. I did add more garlic than called for. 

I doubled the recipe and I can tell you the original would never serve 6! I had 6 for dinner and thank god I doubled it as once we all had a serving there was little left over.

My God.  These were absolutely amazing.  I simmered and cooked 3 large skinned red potatoes in 5 cans of chicken broth.  I mashed the potatoes, put 1/3 cup of cream cheese, and probably 3/4 cup or 1 cup of chicken broth (I used the rest for chicken soup).  I added 1/4 cup of fresh parsley and I forgot to add my roasted garlic since it wasn't done yet.  This tasted awesome even WITHOUT the garlic. MMMM!!!!!

These were DELICIOUS! Forgot to add the parsley though (just realized that now lol) and they were still fabulous! I had served them with the "Cornish Game Hens with Garlic and Rosemary" recipe from this site and just used the garlic that was roasting with the birds. I also used milk instead of broth (I like my potatoes very creamy) My whole family enjoyed these VERY much! Even my 6 yr old had seconds!

Yumm, a keeper!  These were so creamy.  I have made mashed with roasted garlic and cream cheese before but guess I didn't have the right proportions.  This recipe is fool-proof.  You don't taste the cream cheese, the potatoes are light and fluffy(I always use electric mixer; don't like lumpy potatoes) and cooking in the boullion brought another layer of flavor without overpowering; all just the right balance for a perfect mashed potato...and can be made fat free too if one uses f.f. cream cheese.

Great recipe!  I just made this for Thanksgiving and will make it again and again.  Instead of water to boil the potatoes, I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth and skipped the bouillon.  Also, when I was roasting the garlic, I followed the recipe and roasted them for 45 minutes, they turned out burnt black and crispy.  So, I ended up using granulated garlic as a last resort.  Next time, I will probably roast the garlic for 20 minutes, not 45.

Made this for a 4-person dinner party, with chicken marsala, and the meal was a hit.  The cream cheese is a great flavor twist!  We used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon.

These really are the best, and sooo easy.  The first time I made these, I used milk thinking the buillon would make it too watery.  I was wrong, the milk combined with the cream cheese made it too thick.  Buillon is the way to go.  These are OH SO GOOD!!!!  Oh, I substituted the parsley with chives.

So much better than regular mashed potatoes, with great color. Followed directions word for word... only I had to keep the cooked potatoes in the pot for 20 minutes waiting for stuffing to finish cooking. Potatoes didn't overcook, but they seemed to get cold quickly. I figure that's from them sitting in the pot, but I will DEFINATELY make these again. My boyfriend and mom loved them.

This recipe had to be doctored up way too much. I do not mind having to add something a little extra but this honestly did not taste that good w/out that extra something. I added some onion salt, galic powder  garlic salt, and a little butter. Also, a previous reviewer had suggested using Yokon Gold potatoes. Although I had stuck with the red potato I would heed her advice!

Yum yum yum!  These are some GREAT mashed potatoes.  I highly recommend that you press the garlic after you roast it (since the mixer didn't QUITE get it into little chunks), but still a wonderful recipe for mashed potatoes.

The combination of roasted garlic and cream cheese made these the best mashed potatoes I've ever made. The cream cheese is subtle. My friend couldn't tell what was in them, aside from the garlic. Can't wait to make again, even though these are fattening!

These have been a favorite for years.   The bouillon, cream cheese and roasted garlic make it.    Don't substitute.   Yukon golds would work too, but the red skin is pretty.   Yeah, sure add a little cream or half and half if you must but otherwise follow the recipe!

These have to be some of THE BEST potatoes I have made. Everyone loves them! Even though the recipe says it serves 6, I'd say it serves more like 3-4. The roasted garlic is wonderful, as well as the cream cheese. Using the left over potato juice makes the flavor excellent. I'll be making these again for sure!

I found these potatoes to be excellent, just what I was looking for in terms of having a garlic taste that was not overpowering.  I used unskinned yukon gold mashed potatoes per previous reviews, and really thought this added a buttery taste. I think I'd prefer them over red potatoes in this side.  A great and easy method for roasting garlic too, I enjoyed how the garlic mellowed and was not as sharp, much easier to work with as well.

Theses potatoes were very good.  I used milk though instead of water and I forgot to add parsley, but they were still delious.

If I could give more stars I would.  This IS my NEW garlic potato recipe.  I think the boulionn is what makes this one stand out from the rest.  Absolutely delicious whether coupled with some steaks from the grill or complimenting your Holiday meats.  5 + stars!

This was an easy way to turn everyday mashed potatoes into a delicious and attractive side dish.   The creamy texture and rich garlicky flavour means you don't need to have gravy.

These potatoes were a real hit.  My company loved them.  My daughter took the recipe for company she was having and they all loved it too.  This is my new favourite mashed potato recipe.  I didn't leave the skins on - but my daughter did and said they looked prettier.

This dish was so yummy!   I loved the cream cheese in the potatoes.  They were so creamy, however, I did add extra.  I also added some chopped up chives.  I will definately make these again!

I've been making these and variations of this recipe for a while now.  Each and every time is receives great reviews.  Adding 2 tbs of unsalted butter (depending on the saltiness of the stock) to finish brought them to a slightly creamier texture and a richer flavor.  Also used an entire bulb of garlic, each clove exposed and drizzled with EV olive oil, salt and pepper.

I consider myself a connoisseur of mashed potatoes, and must say that these are among the very best. Full of flavor and perfect texture. Just make sure you don't put in too much of the cooking liquid, or they can get a little runny.  Even then, I inhalled them!

These were okay, just make sure you don't add too much of the water/juice because it will taste too salty but some people may like that taste.

These were SO delicious!  I am a beginner cook and could not believe that I made these!  They taste like they're from a fancy restaraunt.  They were easy too.  I don't think you could put in too much garlic.  Very very light and fluffy!  Mmm... will definetly make again!

These are most delicious mashed potatoes, my kids don't like them but my husband and I do.
They're so good I don't even care if the kids won't eat them, I still make them!

They also have way less fat and calories than regular mashed potatoes and they're easy to make.

Left out the bouillon and added whipping cream and skim milk. Also, used regular garlic out of a jar and didn't bother roasting. Very good.

This was great!  Didn't have time to roast garlic, so just threw 7 cloves in with the potatoes to cook.  Turned out great.  Served Melody's Glazed Corn Beef and JoelsGirl Irish Heritage Cabbage..was a hit.
