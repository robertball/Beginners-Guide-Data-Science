in my opinion, the recipe itself was a bit too bland for me and could have definately used some more sugar! it might taste better if the pudding wasn't sugar-free, but kept the remaining ingredients reduced in fat.

This is a fabulous banana pudding...not only is it yummy, but it is relatively good for you.  I downsized the recipe and used one cheesecake and one vanilla sugar-free instant pudding.  I also didn't have any sour cream, so I didn't include it in the pudding.  I also used extra splenda because I thought it couldn't hurt.  Yummy!

This is the low-fat version of banana pudding.  I loosely followed this recipe.  I did use lowfat cream cheese, yogurt in place of sour cream, lite cool whip, 2 packages of sugar free pudding (couldn't find 1 oz pkgs); no sweetener and 4 cups of milk.  It came together quickly and made for a very nice presentation.  Taste was good, but I have had better banana pudding.  Company really liked it and that is what mattered to me.

Our friends raved... & we're Southern, y'all!!!  Used 2 vanilla & 1 banana cream pudding packs &  replaced Splenda with about 1 1/2 teaspoons Agave. Chilled it about 2 hours, and everybody went back for seconds. Love a light recipe hit!! Will make it again!
