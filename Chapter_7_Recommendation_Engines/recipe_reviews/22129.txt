My mother used to make this dish. It was one of my favorites. Still is.

I'm half Chinese and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed in these results. I followed the recipe closely but the sherry was WAY too strong and we ended throwing most of the recipe away.

I thought this was very easy and very tasty. My 11 year old didn't care for the smell. Think it was from the sesame oil. My 2 year old loved the noodles. I will make this again. Maybe add different veggies to it too. I did use Chardonnay unstead of sherry.
