I have been making a similar recipe for years. I only use half the sugar. My husband and kids think its way too sweet otherwise. And I also use mandarin oranges instead of bananas. I put them in @ the same time as the pineapple. Soo good.

My mama's recipe is very similar but we add mandarin oranges (drained) and not so much sugar. Instead of whipping cream, we use cool whip. If it gets too juicy, the marshmellows will soak it up. Yumm :)

This recipe is simple to do and is a hit at any holiday party. Be sure to buy extra bags of fresh cranberries to freeze them so you can enjoy this in the summer as well. 
Also something that the kids can help you prepare.

My family loved this salad. I added 2 finely chopped cups of apples and it was wonderful. My dad is the only cranberry fan in our family but everyone loved this salad.

This was the first cranberry salad I have ever made and I was so glad I picked this recipe to make, it is so delicious.I have never been a big fan of cranberry salads but this one I have a hard time stop eating it.:)I did a couple things that other reviewers suggested;I added mandarin oranges instead of the bananas and I put them in at the same time as pineapple and I put in 11/2 cups of sugar and next time I make it I think I will go with even less.And I used cool whip instead of whipped cream,I think I used more than a cup.I just put in the amount I wanted to.

I have made this for the last three Thanksgivings and I love it.  My family has mixed feelings about it just because the ones who don't like it, don't like anything related to cranberry.  I don't use the banana and I use half Splenda and half sugar to cut some calories.  I also use Cool Whip instead of heavy whipping cream.  The ingredients are few and the directions are easy...worth a try!

I saw this recipe and had to make it because it looked so good, and I was not disappointed! I used cool whip, but otherwise stuck to the original recipe, and I would gladly make this year-round for a dessert, it was delicious!

Yummy! Good salad to go with savory food. And it was nice that there wasn't any geletin in this one so it didn't need to set up.

This salad was really good. I was looking for another side dish to add to my Christms Eve dinner and this was perfect. The only change I made was to add the marshmallows about 4-5 hours before serving because I thought they might get soggy if they sat overnight.

I served this for thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Even my husband that was skeptical was raving about it.  It reminded us of a smoothie.

This is similar to a family recipe I lost... NO BANANA! maybe that's just me...  I also put it back in the frig after folding in the whipped cream.  When it all 'sets' it gets even better!
