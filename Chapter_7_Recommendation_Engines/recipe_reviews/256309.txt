3 1 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/256309/creamy-chipotle-tomato-bisque/ ... Lil Snoo, this is some good soup!  :)  Changes were slight because ran out:  only 1/4c onion, okay, maybe a third cup; 2 1/2c chicken broth; 2/3c heavy cream.  Since I can't go through a can of chipotle peppers quickly, I puree the contents & freeze by Ts.  I used 3T, which would be more than two peppers.  I'll try 2Ts or actual peppers & sauce. next time. Too hot for some, but, with it being smokey & creamy, too; not me.  :)  It's some good soup.  'Not super rich, but still creamy.  Nice-warm-up soup!  A big one for me is that it isn't too tomatoey.  I don't care for cream of tomato soup.  This is spicy soup with tomatoes & cream.  Bueno!  :D  'Only way to improve might be adding  fresh cilantro or tortilla strips as she suggested.   Oh, oh, oh!  I didn't have the fire-roasted so added 1/8t liquid smoke & 1/4t granulated garlic to regular diced toms.

Beware!  For those who are sensitive to hot, spicy food, this is.....spicy hot!  But, in all fairness, I have to say that after we got passed the heat it was really good.  I did up the taste a bit by using 1 t. Trader Joes Chili Lime Seasoning and 1 t. of Cumin.  Next time I would add even more, plus decrease the chipotle peppers to just one.  Thanks France C for the recipe.  We enjoyed it...in spite of the heat!!!

I will start this with I have hated tomato soup since I was a little kid but this may have become my new favorite soup. I thought the spice was perfect, I added some sour cream to my son's to cool it down. If you are not a huge fan of chipotle and spicy things you may wan to cut the amount of peppers down to one or maybe even just the adobo. Otherwise, I made this exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. I crumbled tortilla chips into it but a grilled cheese would have been better!

Really tasty soup! This went really well with our Ham & Cheese Sliders tonight! I'm kind of a spice wimp, so I skipped the chipotle peppers and only used the adobo sauce - which was just right for me. Thanks, LilSnoo, for sharing your recipe!

This is very good and super easy to throw together. I had it on the table in less than 20 minutes. It's pretty spicy but that smoky  roasted flavor keeps you going back for more. Thank you for the recipe.

We'll make again and decided if we'll keep it or not. We followed recipes except added liquid smoke as others suggested. We decided to reduce chipotle pepper to 1 next time and only use 1/8 tsp liquid smoke to try. I thought it seemed very runny, but hubby thought ok.  I'd like to thicken it just a little next time.

Super easy and tasty, it's probably 4-1/2 stars in my book. The chipotle is brilliant; I would actually add more.  I didn't realize that the recipe called for tomatoes with garlic, and garlic would help. I will experiment with an additional herb or two for optimum flavor.  I used half and half (no heavy cream in the house), and a bit less because I supplemented each bowl with a dollop of sour cream. I might try yogurt instead for the tang. This is a LOT better than canned soup, and not much harder.

Absolutely delicious! I used almond milk instead of heavy cream, and  while not as creamy, it is still wonderful. I only used one chipotle and that was perfect amount of spice for me. Topped with some green onions, and it makes for a quick and tasty dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Soooo good! Wouldn't change a thing! If you wanted to make this soup for a special occasion you could throw in some lump crab meat at the end after you puree the soup. Delicious!

I picked this recipe because it was something out of my "comfort" zone. My 7 year old despises tomatoes and I've never cooked with cumin or adobo sauce. That being said, this recipe turned out great. My kids cleaned their bowls, as did my husband and I. I paired it with grilled cheese and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. It had a delicious flavor and was very filling. There was something in it that was slightly...overpowering (I think it was the peppers which I've never cooked with) but that didn't stop us from enjoying it. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was a great, easy to put together soup.  It was creamy and flavorful with the smoky chipotles.  Next time, I plan to use less of the chipotle, because it was a little too spicy for my husband.
I highly recommend for an easy weeknight soup and sandwich dinner!
