Okay another good mashed potato recipe!  I didn't add the green onions (didn't have).  My only addition to this was 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used a potato masher (instead of a mixer) to mash potatoes, so I had a few lumps.  If you want a smoother texture before baking in the oven make sure to use a mixer.  I put the remainder cheese on top the last 5 minutes of baking.

I've made these many times now. A few things I always do: I like to make my mashed potatoes with a combo of mostly potatoes, some broccoli and cauliflower. The veggies will disintegrate after they are cooked and mixed with a mixer or by hand.(I throw in the broc/cauliflower in the last 10-12 minutes that the potatoes are boiling, -Have to try to sneak in some veggies for the kids.) Prepare as usual adding some butter, salt and pepper and reduce milk substituting some sour cream in there. I add in garlic as well. Add in the sauteed peppers and onions, then the cheese, bacon and mix together. Top with cheddar, bacon pieces and green onions for a really colorful and pretty dish.  Family always requests that I bring this!

This was SO great!. I used leftover mashers for this recipe, although it would be fairly quick to whip them up for this recipe as well. I made a few minor alterations- to the mashed potatoes, I simply added some of that precooked microwave bacon(it was only 30 seconds to nuke and chop), Then I omitted the pepper - I simply added my chopped bacon, chopped green onion, cheddar, and I added about 8 oz. of sour cream- mixed it up and sprinkled the remaining cheddar on top- and these were fantastic! Even my picky hubby and 18 mo. old loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are everything you love about twice baked potatoes (except for the skin!) without the fuss. I made this using "Rich Mashed Potatoes," also from this site.  The peppers, especially, added great flavor and color. I also sprinkled this with more crumbled bacon and chopped green onion during the last five minutes of cooking time.  Couldn't be easier, prettier, or more delicious! I served this for a dinner get-together and  there wasn't a spoonful left.

I thought these were really good and really easy.  I used instant mashed potatoes made w/out butter and skim milk, green onion instead of the onion and green peppers.  Did not saute the onion to omit the oil.  Used FF cheese and turkey bacon to help lighten up the recipe.  It was very good!!!  The cheese just gets heated instead of really melting but my picky family loved it.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe! Everyone in the house went back for seconds. I did make some alterations, though. One of the best things about this is how versatile it is. I replaced the onion and green pepper with green onions, and since we have a vegetarian in the house, I omitted the bacon. I also added a dash of garlic powder. Next time I'll probably use half of the pepper this recipe called for, it was a bit much for my tastes. I'll definitely be making it again! Thanks so much for sharing!

Always a family favorite.  I use leftover mashed potatoes to fix this dish.  It is so versatile...you can saute mushrooms with the onions, add chilies, whatever you like on your baked potatoes.  I always leave the last addition of cheese until the last few minutes of baking and have used a variety of chesses, also.  Great with baby swiss.  Thanks for the recipe, Margaret.

YUM! Oh my, what a wonderful flavour! I threw in my cheese with my onions when my onions were done to melt the cheese, it sounds messy and icky, but it is quite nice.

Very good recipe!!  I left out the green pepper as I did not have any.  I used green onions rather than regular onions and added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic.

Very good and great way to use up leftovers mashed potatoes   Didn't have cheddar cheese so used mozarella instead.  Also added 1/2 lb. of bacon, a 1/4 chopped jalepeno, and seasoned salt (to taste).

I had some left-over mashed potatoes to use up, so I thought I would try this recipe. I didn't have any green pepper on hand, just a couple of green onions, that I chopped up. I didn't saute them I just added them to the potatoes along with some cheddar cheese, salt and pepper. I put the potato mixture in two small ramekins and baked for about 25 min. I then added some reserved cheese, green onion and some bacon bits on top. So tasty!

I made this for our dinner guest last night and they absolutely loved it, seconds were in order. I didn't have any green peppers and our guest aren't fans of them anyway. So I just mixed the chopped green onions right into the potatoes instead of pre-cooking them. I used Suzy's red mashed potatoes on this website for the potatoes. Topped with more cheese after it was baked. This is a great recipe to use up any leftover mashed potatoes...if there is such a thing. Thanks Margaret.

This was really tasty. The potatoes puffed up and were really fluffy.  I was lazy and used Hormel Real Bacon from Costco and the flavour was still real nice.  I can't say I can think of a way to improve on this recipe.  We will be enjoying the leftovers warmed up tomorrow.  Thanks Margaret.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these potatos.  I make them ALL the time-- the pair really well with ham, and chicken fried steaks :)
The last few times, I tried a variation that makes them even more rich and creamy.  Don't add the green pepper; instead of vegetable oil, use about 4 tbs of melted butter; reserve the bacon grease, and use about 3-4 tbs of that; add heavy cream or milk to smooth potatos out; add cream cheese, sour cream, sharp cheddar.  Add onion powder, salt and pepper to taste.  I was kinda just throwing random things in to add lots of flavor to it. Obviously not the healthiest variation, but it is SO yummy.

Huge hit at potluck dinner! As others suggested, I added 2 garlic cloves and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also waited until 10 minutes before the dish was done to add the cheese to the top. I added one cup of cheese to the top instead of just 1/2 cup.   I used instant potatoes and oscar meyer bacon crumbles (not bits) and it turned out great!

I made this for Easter dinner along with the Garlic Prime Rib (Chef Mike) recipe on this site. So decadent and super yummy. I made boiled 5 lbs. of potatoes so I had no idea how many cups of mashed potatoes I had. Omitted the onion and green pepper. Added 1+ cup of sour cream and green onions. Mixed it all up in my KitchenAid mixer and baked it in a huge buttered casserole dish with more cheese and bacon on top. My husband (who doesn't care for potatoes) thought these were superb! Definitely adding to my holiday menus!! DELICIOSO!!

This was such a good use of those leftover Thanksgiving m.p.s.  And healthier the typical recipe for 2x bakeds.  I was lazy and used real (prepared)bacon bits and they still came out good.  I baked them with slice of pancetta on top, which helped make up for the bacon shortcut. Also, skipped the salt.

I used green onions (I did not saute them), finely chopped red pepper instead of green (as we don't care for green peppers--I did saute these with a little fresh garlic), I prepared the mashed potatoes with butter and sour cream and I doubled the bacon. I only used a pinch of sea salt and I added garlic powder. We thought this was very tasty and I'm glad I made the changes I did.

A family favorite. I omitted the green peppers - I don't like them. I added more onion and bacon - because I love those flavors. Have added a Mexician cheese blend. It was the potato requested for this year's Christmas dinner.

Not too bad.  I was trying to find a way to use up oodles of mashed spuds after thanksgiving (my hubby got carried away peeling them) and this was pretty good.

This was really good.  I didn't use green peppers.  I used green onion, added garlic, white pepper, sour cream and heavy whipping cream, for texture.  I also added parmesan on top, which browned nicely. I may try this with prosciutto next time.

I made this tonight along side a roast pork and the end result was good - but not outstanding.  I didn't use green pepper because we don't like them - but I followed the directions for everything else.  The end result was creamy and good - but it was missing something - just not sure what.

I have to admit, I was a little "iffy" about the green pepper beforehand. Used 1/2 a red onion, chopped, most of a bell pepper, even soy milk in the mashed potatoes. The guys (and me) devoured this!  Thanks so much!

This is a great tasting side dish that my family fought over.  I followed the recipe as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The next time I prepare this dish I will add a clove of garlic (I love, love, love garlic).

SALTY! These were too salty for us with the bacon and 1 tsp of salt.  I had to make another two cups of unsalted mashed potatoes to mix in with the original four cups just to balance it out.  I might try this again without adding the 1 tsp of salt.

This was a great starter recipe! Like others, I added garlic, sour cream and used a combination of cheddar and jack cheeses. I also cooked the potatoes in chicken broth. Thanks so much for the idea!!

i have to say this recipe has started a wonderful trend! I had to make a few alterations as I didn't have everything required for the exact recipe. I used 7-8 small red potatoes, wrapped them in foil and baked (about 50 minutes). i let them cool for a little bit, put them in a bowl, mashed with a fork, added about 2 tbls of butter and a little milk, a little garlic salt and a pinch of lemon pepper. (w/ a little reg. salt and pepper.) sauteed green peppers and onions. I mixed the potatoes, butter, milk, spices, w/ 1/2 the cheese (i cut about 10 pieces into slivers w/ a knife) w/ mixer.(it will be thick) then i added the peppers and onions and mixed in w/ a fork. I put all that in a lightly greased 2qt pan, covered w/ remaining cheese and baked for about 20 minutes until the cheese was melted. (cooking time may vary, mine was pretty fast-due to potatoes being just baked before i mashed them so they were still warm).  I've made this twice in 2 weeks. MY BOYFRIEND AND I LOVE IT!!!!!

P.S. I added 1 cup of sour cream like others suggested and loved it!

Love it...easy to make & tastes great!  I didn't have shredded cheddar cheese..so I used Pizza blend shredded cheese instead and it worked just as good.    Also,  I cooked my bacon first then I drained all the grease but  just a little and sauteed my peppers and onions with a little garlic powder...It turned out wonderful.  Made Italian Meatloaf  (recipe from here...it was awesome)  and they went well together.

I wanted some "crunch" on top of the potatoes, so I crushed some Funyuns and sprinkled them over the top.  That was a big hit with my husband!  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper into the mixture, then sprinkled the tops with a bit of paprika.

I decided not to change the recipe because I always alter recipes and I thought that mashed potatoes of all things could not be skrewed up... i was wrong. Please... PLEASE... do what other reviewers suggest... add sour cream, ranch, anything... just read what they have to say and believe it.

Didn't add green pepper because son-in-law doesn't like it. Delicious so I don't think peppers are needed. Made the potatoes day before Easter and reheated in oven. Entire crowd enjoyed the potatoes with ham and fresh asparagus.

I made a version of this and it turned out great! I used green and white onion, left out the green peppers, used butter instead of oil, 2 cups sour cream, some herbs and seasomings and a couple tblsp Dijon Mustard. Mixed it all up and put it in a baking dish. Topped with cheddar cheese and baked for about 35 mins till hot and bubbly. Basically I turned it into a casserole. SOOO good!

Excellent mashed potatoes! I did sub green onions for the reg onions, cooking the whites w/the green peppers & just throwing in the greens when it was ready to go in the oven. I used "Traditional Mashed Potatoes" from AR. Thanks!!

YUM! Used bacon bits instead of fresh bacon and added green onions on top with the cheese, which I personally think made the dish even more spectacular. Add a bit of sour cream on top when finished, and these are perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I added milk and butter to my mash potatoes – and whipped them with the mixer.  After I added all the other ingredients – and transferred to baking dish – the potatoes seemed a little moist (maybe too much milk in mashed potatoes) so I baked for 10 min longer.  Turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome dish! I didn't use bell pepper as I didn't have any so used some green onion instead. Made as is but mashed my potatoes with milk, butter, Tony's, and a few tbsp sour cream. This is a keeper!

I used green onions, red bell peppers, mushrooms, and mexican shredded cheese..plus added crumbled bacon.  This recipe turned out fantastic.  I took the advice of others and added the cheese ten min prior to end baking time.

I add one beaten egg and 1/2 cup sour cream to make it fluffy, but then I always add sour cream to my mashed potatoes.  Rather then mix in vegetables, I just sauted bell peppers, onions and mushrooms for people to add according to their tasted.  Served with a steak dinner.

Good...next time I'll kick it up a notch with some cayenne.  I did add 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno without the seeds.  I used the leftover potatoes the next day to make soup.

I used the recipe for Day Before Mashed Potatoes as the base.  I omitted the onion and green pepper and added green onions.  I also added 1/3 cup milk to thin out the potatoes as they were a bit dry for my taste. Instead of topping with cheese I cooked then topped with chives before serving.

OMG, soooo good! I love stuffed baked potatoes and this tastes exactly like them without having to maintain the potato skin! The only thing I changed with the recipe was I omitted green peppers as my husband doesn't care for them and I used green onions (no need to fry) instead of regular onion.

My mashed were hot when put into bake. They dried out a little. In future I will just serve the mashed potato with half the cheese plus the other ingredients, and forgo the baking.I used the bacon fat when whipping the potatoes,maybe that contributed to the dryness, otherwise followed recipe as written.

Great recipe to "eyeball" ingredients. I omitted the green pepper, and added a dollop of ranch dressing. I also mixed in fresh green onions instead of sauteing white ones. What's not to like here? Yummy!!

On the sugguestion of other cooks I did add about 1/4 c. of sour cream.  Instead of cooking onions in oil, I used the grease from frying the bacon.  It tastes great.

This turned out pretty good.  I did not have green pepper, so I left that out. But it was pretty tasty.

This was fantastic with a couple changes.  I omitted the green pepper and onion and used sauteed scallions instead.  I reserved a little of the green onion and bacon to sprinkle on top too.  Will make again and again!

I've made this three or four times now for holiday dinners or when guests are coming over. It's really good! I used an old cheddar the last time I made it and found it added a nice kick. It's a tasty side dish and definitely worth making.

Yummy and easy!  I omitted the green pepper and added 3 chopped scallions, 1/2 cup of sour cream and garlic salt to taste.  I also substituted pepper jack cheese for the cheddar and it turned out fabulous!

excellent,  I used the mash potatoes from http://allrecipes.com/recipe/traditional-mashed-potatoes/detail.aspx.  So i skip the pepper and salt since it was already in the potatoes.

I do not know if I did something wrong but I followed the recipe almost exactly, with some of the changes that others reviewed. But the onion flavor was overwhelming and it was extremely salty. I may try again with this type of recipe...but not this one. We wasted nearly the whole batch.

Yummy!! Only did a couple things different. I sauteed the onions and peppers in a tablespoon of the bacon grease instead of oil. I added all the cheese to the mixture instead of using half in the mix and the rest on top (I find cheese gets too hard when melted on top). And I added the crumbled bacon to the top after cooking it (I think bacon gets a little soggy when being combined in the mix and then cooking it). Thanks for the recipe!

I kind of liked it and my BF completely hated. My problem was that it wasn't flavored enough-maybe it needed more salt??? i don't know! and the cheese wasn't as present as i hoped.My boyfriends problem was the onions-be strongly believes that onions do not belong on mash potatoes. I am not going to dismiss this recipe though, next time i make it i plan on layering it with ground beef-and only adding onions to the ground beef NOT the potatoes-kind of like a shepherds pie.

This was nice for using leftover mashed potatoes w/out all the twice-baked difficulty and a little more flavor than regular mashed potatoes.

Very good.  I cut up the bacon and cooked it with the onions and peppers at the same time, then drained it all on a paper towel.  I used yukon gold potatoes which have such a smooth texture.  My small family of four (two young-uns) ate almost the entire dish.  They said it's a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  Since my husband and I are both lactose intolerant, I had to substitute anything dairy, so I followed the base recipe, nixed the onion and green pepper, and used plain soy milk, Tofutti Sour Cream, and Veggie Shreds Monterrey Jack/Cheddar cheese blend and bacon of course :)  Can't even tell the difference! YUM!!!

What a delicious way to serve twice-baked potatoes, but with much less effort!  Rave reviews by my guests, and I even left out the onions because one guest has an alergy to them.  I did add sour cream, but otherwise, followed the recipe as stated.  Great to make ahead as well.

Awesome!  Tasted just like potato skins!  I used the frozen microwave steamed potatoes, and followed the recipe exactly.  The kids and hubby loved this.  It's for  sure a keeper!

Probably deserves a higher rating, but I couldn't follow the exact recipe due to picky eaters. I left out the fresh onions (used minced), green peppers, and bacon, so it lacked some flavor.  I did add some pepper and I still liked it alot, but I'm going to have to try some other seasonings to perk it up next time.

Really good. I love twiced baked potatoes so this seemed like an easier way to go. I think it could use double the bacon and tripple the cheese. I need mine extra, extra cheesy out of preference. I also think the sharper the cheese the better.

Yummy!! I wish I'd found this when I was pregnant with my son, I would kill for potato skins :) I don't measure anything and I don't put in the onion or green pepper. If I have them, I'll sometimes put in green onion, but my guys are happy with just cheese and bacon. I also put in sour cream.

This recipe was tops!  I didn't have green peppers and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream for a little bit of a "tater skins" taste.  This was easily prepared earlier in the day in the crockpot and had a nice crunch to it when prepared this way.  Great recipe-loved by all!

Who knew that adding green peppers would make a world of difference?! I also put minced roasted garlic to the mix. This recipe was hands down the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, I will never eat it again any other way! The BF and my friends absolutely loved it. Thank you for sharing this!

Hello! This is a keeper! Like the recipe says, use whatever you like on a baked potato. I didn't use as much green pepper, and yet added/sauteed green onions. Top with additional crumbled bacon, chives, and cheese when serving. I agree that adding the cheese on top (that melts) should be added the last 5-10 minutes. Good stuff!

It was good. I cheated and used instant potatoes, maybe that's why it was great. Will try again with the real thing next time.

Fantastic!  I didn't use the bell pepper because it sounded like a bizarre addition to mashed potatoes, but the overall end result was delicious.    I minced my onion rather than chopping it to conceal it better.

These were excellent! I left the bacon on the side for people to sprinkle on, so that our mixed vegetarian/nonveg family could all eat it. It was liked by everyone and will certainly make again. Thanks!

Very good recipe, made it for a dinner party. As did others I added sour cream to the mashed potatoes and I substituted green onions for regular onion. Turned out wonderful and I will definitely make again.

This is a good recipe but not great. I felt that it was missing something. I just read a few of the reviews and decided it was missing sour cream I really think that would have made this a GREAT recipe. I will make this recipe again and use some sour cream. I also think using different kinds of cheese such as pepper jack would give it a bit a kick.

This was soooo good!  Kind of like a "loaded" twice-baked mashed potato!  I added some garlic powder (because I add it to everything) and it was still a little bland for my taste.  I ended up adding quite a bit more salt than the recipe called for but overall I love this recipe and will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so yummy, there was barely any for leftovers.  Next time I will double the recipe so that we have leftovers.  It was a hit!

This was really tasty!  I used green onions instead of the green pepper and onion mixture, added some minced garlic to the sauted onions.  I used fake bacon instead of real (I am a vegetarian) and this tasted FANTASTIC!  I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I added a bit extra salt and pepper at the end because it was a tad bit bland - but otherwise excellent!

Overall, the recipe is a great starting point.  For my mashed potatoes, I used gold potatoes whipped with about 5 tbsp. of butter and 1/2 c. sour cream.  I then added raw (didn't saute - will soften during baking) green onion to the potatoes, instead of regular, left out the green pepper, and added about 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Mixed in some of the bacon and cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Transferred to my baking dish and sprinkled the remaining cheese and bacon on top.  Baked and drooled at the sight of the melting cheese  :D  Very, very good recipe idea!  Will be sure to use on a regular basis!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  Since my family loves cheese, I use the whole cup of cheese in the mashed potatoes and then sprinkle more cheese on top before baking.

We loved this recipe.  I prepared my potatoes with sour cream and left out the green peppers because my boyfriend doesn't like them.  I also used colby/cheddar cheese crumbles instead of shredded and it was so good.  My 10 month old son even gobbled these up!

This recipe was delicious, though I did a bit of a variation. I didn't add any green pepper, so I added twice the amount of onion. It turned out beautifully. I highly recommend this one for a nice side dish at a bbq

Made as written and it was very good!I think baking just until heated through and cheese melts is plenty. It was a tad dry but still good.

These were very good.  If your mashed potatoes are made ahead of time it needs to bake at least 30 minutes.  I also added garlic and next time I think I will add sour cream.

This was a really good recipe which everyone in my family loved, i just made a few changes, i put fish flakes instead of becon cos my family doesn't like becon much, and put garlic and a little more pepper to give it a extra flavour, i increased the baking time to 30 mins because of the fish. It was a simple and a tasty meal

These were very good.  Used leftover regular mashed potatoes, omitted the green pepper and the oil, added some FF sour cream, green onions, garlic powder, bacon bits, and the cheddar cheese of course, mixed it all together, and topped with more grated cheddar cheese and baked in the oven.  Thanks for sharing!!

I dont really like mashed potatoes but most of my family does so I am always looking for a creative way to dress them up - this was it!! I didnt have a green pepper but I did have a red one so I used that - I doulbled the bacon and used more cheese than called for and added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mix - it was great -my kids were a no go (they are 3 and 4 and dont like much) but the rest of us were happy

I used to make a similar but more simplistic version of this when my kids were younger. Was looking for the recipe when i came across this one and i'm glad I did!! The bacon and peppers in this changed the taste completely and made it that much better! Thank you!

We really enjoyed this. I used instant potatoes. I skipped the onion and green pepper, and instead cut up two green onions and sauteed them in about 1.5 tbs of 'I can't believe its not butter' with a tsp of minced garlic. I used Colby cheese, and after adding the onion/garlic mixture, bacon, and cheese to the potatoes, I added a little sour cream to make the mixture more smooth and uniform. We had this with 'Tanya's southern fried Louisiana chicken' and while it was a good side dish for fried chicken, the potatoes were very hearty and filling. Hubby and I agreed that this dish might be better served on its own, instead of a side dish. All in all this is an easy, tasty dish, especially if you love loaded mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing!

Yummmm! Great new way to use up my leftover mashed potatoes. I used turkey bacon and didn't like how it was soft. I like the cripy pork bacon for this dish much better. So if you make these go all out.

These totally ROCKED!! The only things I did differently was I used 1/2 green peppers and 1/2 red peppers, and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic. Will definitely make again! Thanks for a great recipe! :-)

This recipe was soooo good!  The family ate it up!  Made the mashed potatoes with lots of butter and half and half, used 1 cup crumbled feta cheese in the mix and a parmesan mixture on top. The flavor was so yummy!!  I added more potatoes then recipe says and it was still great!

Loved this.  I used instant potatoes instead of real mashed potatoes.  I also left out the green pepper as we don't like it much.  Otherwise it was great and I shared it with my family.

This was a great potato recipe - so good with halibut, but could go with just about anything. I used red pepper instead of green, and chives instead of onion (I added them to the pepper for the last few minutes of sauteeing). It only took 15 minutes for the cheese to melt - but my potatoes were warm.Thanks for the recipe Margaret.
