This was a different and very tasty way to fix sweet potatoes for the holidays.  I made it several times and changed it a bit to suit my taste and time schedule.  Instead of peeling and slicing the apples, I just chunked them with the peels on and I also doubled the amount of maple syrup and butter.  It was a BIG hit with my family.

I think I will cut the syrup in 1/2 next time, it was way to sweet for me.  I also added a little nutmeg for some depth (pecans would have been good too)

Really good recipe though, will make again!

I made these for Easter.  I used two large (29 oz.) cans of sweet potatoes drained.  As one reviewer suggested I doubled the butter and syrup (used real maple syrup). Assembled them into a crock Sat. night and stuck it in the fridge uncooked.  When I awoke Sun. morning I popped the crock into the crockpot and cooked on low. It was ready when we returned from church 4-5 hours later.  For the amount of work involved (comparing it to other sweet potato recipes where you have to use a mixer, etc.)I was surprised at how delicious these were! Will make again (at the request of my 6 sons and husband) many, many times--especially holidays.
