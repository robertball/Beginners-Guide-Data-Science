My husband has been talking fondly of this dish for years so I finally researched AR and fortunately found this recipe. After reading the other reviews, I decided to use some of the other cook's advise with great success. I baked the potatoes on the oven rack after slathering with EVOO and kosher salt (lightly). The tuna mixture was seasoned with 2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, 1/3 cp maoy and 1/3 cp sour cream along with the scallion onions. My husband was thrilled and announced, "now this is comfort food!". Thank you, Nascargirl and your thoughtful stepmom!

This is sort of like a tuna casserole in potato form. Was a big hit with kids, they didn't even notice there was fish. However, it didn't go over well with me. The texture was a little funny.

It was good but if you cut the amount of mayo in half and add sour cream, it's even better.

This was actually really good. I microwaved the potatoes for 10 min (5min then turned over and another 5min). Added salt and pepper to the tuna, pot, mayo, green onion mix.

If you are tired of tuna sandwiches or tuna caserole, this is a great change for canned tuna. I used a little bit more mayo, I think it depends on the size of the potatoes, and added Tony Chazery's for some spice. Very good.

I thought these were very good and my 8 year old son loved them (he kept eating the filling while I was stuffing the skins). My husband thought they were OK and my picky 9 year old daughter would't eat them. But they're not tuna lovers so that is not a surprise. If you do like tuna, you'll love these. Thanks for the great idea.

This recipe was just okay.  It was a little dry and I even used half mayo half sour cream.  Next time I am thinking of adding butter and more salt to the mixture.  I also just nuked the potatoes then finished them in the oven.  Something I will try again.

instead of baking these for an hour i nuked them 5 mins, flipped them, and nuked them another 5 mins. after i scooped out the flesh (to which i added garlic powder and celery salt)i placed them flesh side down and rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. i baked them directly on the oven rack with a baking sheet on the rack beneath it to catch any potato ooze.after much contemplation i served with garlic toast topped with sauteed mushrooms in garlic(also from this site). thanks for a different approach to using inexpensive tuna.

We ate these for lunch, and they were great. I used 6 potatoes since some of mine were smallish. I added 1 tsp. of yellow curry to the mix and used fat free miricle whip instead of mayo. I also used mozzerella instead of cheddar since I thought it would go better with the curry. I think these would have been a tiny bit on the boring side if I hadn't of added the curry, but still would have been pretty good.

Why I love allrecipes!  This was in various women's magazines in about 1968 before we had started to worry about fat.  I liked it then, made it often, tossed the recipe because it was so simple I didn't need it but more than 40 years later I'd forgotten the ratios.  It's good as is but a little dressing up with spice or down with fat doesn't hurt.  This is comfort food.

I had lost the recipe for potunas & took a chance on a recipe search since my mother had gotten the recipe back in the 1960s.  So glad to find it again!  These are delicious left over - cold or warmed.  Thanks Nascargirl88 & allrecipes!

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. We had dubbed it Tuna Boats by dinnertime, though Potunas is quite an inventive name. I added Creole Seasoning to the mixture to spice it up and ended up using about 1/4 cup reduced fat sour cream and 1/2 cup light mayo. This is such an economical, tasty, and simple meal; I'm glad I found it! Thanks!

My husband and I really like this recipe. My boys aren't so crazy about it, but we like to make it every now and then. Perfect comfort food! Kinda of like combining potato soup with a tuna casserole. Yum.

This has been a staple in our house for thirty years or more. We usually use chives because they are growing right outside the kitchen door. We put most of the cheese into the potato mixture and then add a topping -- beat two egg whites until stiff, fold in a couple of tablespoons of mayo and the remaining cheese.
     The topping browns during the final bake. Great comfort food. Chopped onion and chopped red bell pepper are other good additions. Haven't tried sautéed mushrooms but bet they would be great. It is a very forgiving recipe. TIP: use a melon baller to remove the inside of the baked potato. It is much easier to control as compared to a spoon.

We really enjoy this for a change up of the ordinary.  Lots of options: Crumble bacon on top, add green onions, different spices to add a twist (italian, seafood, etc.) and super easy to make.

Nice flavour combination! The first time I made it just as written and it turned out great; my young kids liked it and the adults enjoyed it too. The next time I made it I didn't plan ahead and so quickly boiled & mashed the potatoes and blended the remaining ingredients together, then spread it into an oven pan and baked 20 minutes. Turned out fluffy with a crispy top, and shaved about 40 minutes off the baking time.

We really enjoyed these.  I let my potatoes bake for a little over an hour.  It was a little difficult to scrap out the insides, my potatoes kept wanting to fall apart.  I used 8 potatoes, 3 packets of tuna and 2 cups of shredded cheese and found the filling to be plenty to stuff all the halves.  I also added some salt, pepper and about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic to the mixture.  Taste was good and easy to make!

haha . simple & nice .
i ran out of cheese and green onions, but it was still good.
When I scooped the potatoes out, I left some potato inside, baked it the second time with the mix, and the potato that was left with the skin was delicious .

Very tasty although I changed it a bit.  Used a little milk and margarine in the potato mix along with a little more mayo.  Also, I used chopped red onions instead of the green (didn't have them.)  Family ate it all!

Much better than expected. I made them with smaller red potatoes & without the cheese. They would make great appetizers. Next time we want to try it with sour cream.

I used 8 medium potatoes, 4 cans of tuna, and mozzerella, and I added a little bit of frozen broccoli and salt. I also "eyeballed" everything so I'm not sure of measurements. I think I should have baked the potatoes a little longer (they were hard to mash up) but they came out tasty and my family loved them! I had a lot of extra filling that I put in a cassarole and topped with cheese.

Delicious, satsifying and simple to make. Even my boyfriend (the frozen ready meal addict) loved these!

Usually when I try something different, my kids give it the thumbs down, but we all liked this one.

I thought that these were really good.  I added a lot more mayonaise and cheese-can't even say how much-just added until it was creamy like I like it-so mine were definately more fattening!  I thought that these were a nice change of pace for dinner.  Husband liked them as well.  Easy to make too.
