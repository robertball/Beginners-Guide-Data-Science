Delicious. I had a jar of cranberry jalapeno sauce so I used that and I used corn tortillas that I cut into small circles and then crisped up in a mini muffin tin. These are dinner tonight, along with a bowl of homemade soup. Added salt and pepper

I made this for our dart league and got so many compliments about how good this was. They all wanted the recipe. I wonder, though, could you use chicken too, instead of turkey?
