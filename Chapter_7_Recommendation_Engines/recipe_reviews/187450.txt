I think the problem some people had with rising was because I was taught to use a metal baking pan for yorkshire puds, preferably cast iron for the heat retention; and it has to be hot, hot, hot before you add the batter.  Also, if you don't drain the fat from the meat and use that instead of adding butter to the batter you will get a more meaty flavor.  I sauteed my veggies til they were almost soft, then browned the meat in my cast iron frying pan, then popped the pan into the oven until it was good and hot before I added the batter.  My Yorkie rose so high it almost crawled out of the pan!

Well first of all, it tasted great, but I did things a little different. First of all I cooked the beef first because usually when you make yorkshire you are supposed to bake right away, never set aside batter! I sauteed beef, onions, celery, and carrots. Added to it about 2 tbsp each HP sauce and Tony Romas Bold n spicy bbq sauce, Also about 1 tbsp beef oxo. When ready I whipped together the yorkshire mix, with a wisk (not a mixer) and layered the beef and pudding mix in a large rectangle pyrex, this way the yorkshire isn't burning on top and runny in the middle, or sunken into the beef. It actually nicely coated around the beef mix like a quiche almost, and the top had about 10 little peaks of golden brown yorkshire. Something is still off a bit, and there should be more rising done, but overall, the family was satisfied with the taste and texture, done this way. Next time I think I'll add corn too, it is kind of like sheperds pie when you have no potatoes in the house!

My husband loved this!  Loved it!  I made it using my extra large iron skillet and the Yorkshire mixture rose as expected - it was beautiful!  I did add two tablespoons of our favorite BBQ sauce (honey mesquite) which enhanced the flavor a lot.  This one is a keeper for us.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. I added 1 cup beef broth and 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup diced onions and 2 garlic cloves grated. I saute'ed the onion and garlic, then added ground beef and browned the meat , then added Worcestershire sauce and Steak sauce, also salt and pepper. I then added tomatoes, carrots and celery, and beef broth and then simmered until all the liquid had reduced down. I then prepared the Yorkshire pudding mixture according to the recipe. Then I put the meat mixture in a metal baking pan that had been heated in the oven before. I packed the meat tightly together and flattened it, then poured Yorkshire pudding mixture on top and baked for 55 minutes in oven. The Yorkshire pudding rose but did fall down when it came out of the oven, but it was still delicious.

Easy to make but definitely needs more flavor. Perhaps if one were to increase the amount of steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce...

I really enjoyed this recipe. So did my 1 year old and ten year old. I added mushrooms to it and sprinkled a little more a1 sauce after we sat down to eat. It does seem more like a quiche but I'm not sure what the difference is supposed to be. Either way, I like the carrots and think that next time I'll add some peas or green beans and maybe some green pepper. I enjoyed it.

Very good recipe for Yorkshire but found the beef mixture bland.  Try adding 1/ 2 of a pkg of Onion soup mix to your favorite gravy mixture then the mixture of beef and make it a gravy...always nice to pour over the yorkies!

I like this idea. But I just had to review this before I had a go at it ,I'm married to a Yorkshireman, and if I gave him Yorkies cooked this way he would have a fit!!!  Firstly no raising agent is used in real Yorkies, all purpose flour, yes, but only one egg with one cup.  finally the oven needs to be stupidly hot, at least 200, this is why some reviews are upset by lack of rise, 175 will never make good puffy Yorkshire puddings.

Did not open oven door, but top still didn't raise. It just sunk down into the meat mixture, and kind of ended up tasting a little "eggy". I agree that the steak sauce could have been increased, although the flavor of the meat mixture was good. I put my celery & carrots in with the burger & onions while browning to start them cooking. I was afraid 45 minutes in oven would not cook them fully. I was right, even with the precooking, they were still a little underdone. Overall not bad though.

The taste is good but the pudding mixture just sank into the ground beef and did not rise.

Fairly easy to put together, and my whole family liked it.  I had to throw the batter into my blender b/c the melted butter solidified when I added the cold milk, so I would suggest letting the milk come to room temp first.  

This was exactly what I had in mind when I was looking for recipes for dinner tonight.

Just made this for the first time (and probably the last) for dinner tonight.  I increased the onion and celery and added some Montreal Steak Seasonings to the ground beef mixture.  The taste wasn't too bad but the texture was awful. The topping did not rise "tall" like the recipe said.  It sank into the meat and made it kind of quiche like.  BTW,  I dind't open the oven door while it was cooking so that wasn't the problem.  Not worth the effort or ingredients.

A hearty dish to make with things you have on hand, more s&p recommended. Don't open the oven door to peek and topping will not drop.

Made this for my Dad because I don't eat meat. He said the meat had a good flavor so gave that a slightly higher rating. The problem was the Yorkshire. Let me start by saying I make popovers (basically the same as Yorkshire pudding) often and always successfully. The trick is to make sure everything you use is as warm as possible. Ingredients should be room temp if not warmer. Oven should be HOT, so should the pan you are putting the ingredients in. The higher the temp of everything you are using, the better your rise will be (there really is a science to it that I won't get into here). Despite my experience, I could not get this dough to rise. I actually had the oven at 425 and would recommend 450. Make sure that the hamburg is HOT when you pour the batter on. Using individual popover pans (or cupcake pans, or ramekins) might encourage more rise also. In any case, there was not enough hamburg to balance the batter so it just got suspended in the batter and made a doughy popover with bits of hamburg in it. See my photo. My Dad rarely gives my dishes a rating below an 8 and his comment on this was "you can't nail it every time". I did taste the dough and we both agreed it was too dense and eggy. My Dad wound up picking the hamburg out of it. Just not good. Sorry, I wish I had a better review, I had big hopes for this one! Thanks for posting anyway.

I made it almost exactly like the the instructions but I forgot to saute the onions with the meat, I just added them raw, so I cooked it an extra 5 minutes. It turned out perfect. The top was brown, it rose like it was supposed to, the moisture content was perfect. We loved it, very good dish!

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious as did my 3 kids and my husband! I added a little more A1 and some garlic powder to my meat, and left in the oven for an additional 10 mins. It was amazing! I will be making this again!

Okay, here's what you do...  You pre-fry the onions, celery and carrots with a little olive oil and garlic salt until the onions are translucent.  Then, you add this mixture to the cooked ground beef; then add your Worchestershire and A1 sauce and stir.  Then cover with your Yorkshire pudding mixture and bake in the oven.  I guarantee it will not be bland.

This was a great base BUT I found that you need a gravy with it because it was some what dry.... I added a large can of cream of mushroom soup with like a 1/4 cup of milk to the left overs and it was wonderful.... Next time gonna try with brown gravy or onion/mushroom gravy to it

I made this tonight-first time ever had Yorkshire anything. I would make it again, but it needs a little more kick in flavor. I did not use carrots or celery, but everything else was the same. I’m guessing the celery gives off more taste, but they can sometimes overpower a dish.

Pudding was nice and moist, not  too cakey and kept the meat from drying out while baking. 
I used Chipotle BBQ sauce and it gave the meat mixture a nice kick. 
I will definitely make this recipe again, adding more veggies like peas and mushrooms to balance out the meat.

Flavorful and simple to make. I've made this 2 or 3 times now and it's a nice change up to our regular meal line up.

I read the other reviews and they're certainly right about following the classic rules of Yorkshire pudding: room temp ingredients, whisk it at the last moment and a Hot oven!  I also added some beef broth and steak spice to the hamburger and sautéed onion and garlic first.  I will make it again with the modifications.

We'd never had this type of dish before and it reminds me of dinner quiche. Very tasty flavor, but the texture is a little different. Would make again!

Easier than I expected and turned out great.  I normally don't do well with things that "rise", but no problems.  Used bison instead of lean beef and highly recommend it.  (Less grease to deal with the better.) Also added diced radishes just because I had them.  Used glass pyrex baking dish and pudding rose beautifully.  Flavor would seem to be driven by your choice of steak sauce.  I used Heinz 57 and ketchup and enjoyed it.  Will definitely make again.

This needs gravy. By the time the Yorkshire pudding was done, my beef mixture was very dry underneath.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I had always wanted to make Yorkshire pudding since I tasted it years ago at a Renaissance Faire.  I did make some changes after reading other reviews.   I did not drain the beef and instead added 2 T four, 1 cup hot water and a beef boullion cube to make a sauce; seasoned with dried basil, thyme, salt and pepper.  Also, I used ½ cup red bell pepper instead of the carrots, and increased the Worcestershire sauce  to 2 tablespoons (did not have  steak sauce).  To make sure the pudding rose I brought eggs to room temperature, warmed the milk and used a pre-heated 8x8 inch aluminum pan.  Hubby loved it, and I will definitely be making it again.  Yummy and such good comfort food!

It was very good! My first Yorkshire. With meat. 2 changes made were no celery because husband doesn't like it tho I used celery salt, and I made meat mixture before the pudding mixture. I feel that is the problem some are having getting it to rise. I'm thinking of trying some different variations in seasonings. I will definitely try again!  ( I did not press my meat mixture into pan so pudding filled in around meat. But it got nice and fluffy!)

I used Pamela's gluten free mix instead of the flour,  baking soda,  and salt because we are gluten intolerant.  This was very tasty tho I had to add seasonings to the meat mixture... The recipe would have been very bland.  I also added Parmesan cheese to the topping batter.

Very tasty!  I did change a few things.  I cooked the veggies with the beef and added a shot (or two) of Tabasco and about a teaspoon of dried basil.  I pressed the beef so the Yorkshire would stay on top.  Next time I make this I will add something to keep the beef together.  My husband says to skip the Tabasco next time.

This meal was a huge hit with all five of my kids and my husband. It was nice and simple to make and clean up was a breeze. I chose to add broccoli in place of the carrots and celery. I didn't have any A1 steak sauce on hand so I threw in ground mustard, worcestershire, dry mustard, dried parsley,salt and pepper. By setting the serving size to feed 8, I was able to have two 9x11 casserole dish meals. This recipe is going into my regular family meals for sure.

Took advice from other commenters, used a cast iron skillet.  Turned out great but next time I will add some gravy or something with the beef to add some moisture and extra flavor.

Loved it. Cooked the veggies with the meat in a cast iron skillet, added the "batter" and put the hot skillet in the oven.   I don't think it would have turned out so well without the cast iron or something comparable.   It's the same principle when making a cobbler.  Without the already heated cast iron the bread does not cook right.

I used people's tips when it came to the Yorkshire pudding (ingredients room temp, cook @ 400, etc). However, did my own thing w/ground beef. I did mexican...taco season like instructions on pack & added salsa & corn...delicious!!!!

This was just so-so for my family.  I think it could have used more meat.  I made it as directed and ended up adding minced garlic, and nature season.  Also added some bullion, flour and milk and made a light gravy to give it some moisture.  It came out just right, guess it's just not to our taste.  Thank you for sharing.

It was decent. Good parts are that it rose well, was a little crisp at the top edges like baked mashed potatoes and the texture was interesting. Bad parts (to me anyway), it was bland overall. I added more spice to the meat. Also will add something, perhaps cream cheese to the pudding part as that was bland too. I ended up with sriracha on it (and will be considering a sriracha cream cheese pudding or at least a layer of cream cheese before the pudding? for next time haha :) I would also reduce the butter as it had a pool of grease on the top in the middle. It did get absorbed back into the pudding when I let it cool a little, but it said to serve immediately and it didn't look appetizing! This might have happened because I used a round tall dish, not sure. Will try a long one next time! Overall good. I had seconds :)

I made this in a 9-inch pie plate.  I thought the flavor was okay, but would add more seasonings next time.  I added 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and did not have a problem with my dough rising.  I think next time I will decrease the flour to 3/4 cup and the milk to 1 cup.

I make this regularly. I use a cast iron pan to brown my meat and onion and usually just use a frozen mixed veg to add to meat mix. Then I make the pudding batter. I pat the meat down well so there aren't open spaces, pour the batter right over the meat in the cast iron and pop it in the oven. It rises well every time.

Very yummy!Especially if youre looking for a homey meal. I took the tip on cooking it in my cast iron pan and the Yorkshire rose beautifully. Substituted olive oil for butter and also used half of beef bouillon.

I made this and it didn't rise at all and was really greasy despite draining the beef.

Very easy to make, and very tasty, filling.  Nice all in one hot meal.
