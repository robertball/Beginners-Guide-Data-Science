Good flavor. I used turkey sausage and add diced onion in cooking the meat. Will make this again.

Big on flavor, super easy to pull together, and a short list of ingredients.  No alterations needed.  What more could you ask for?

It is amazing how so few ingredients result in such a flavorful and delicious dish. Needs no tweaking at all. I made it exactly as written, my entire family loved it - their bowls were practically licked clean. Served with cornbread as stated by another reviewer. This will be a regular in our home, but from now on I will always make double and hope for some leftovers!

Like another reviewer, I sauteed some chopped onion in a little olive oil to start, then added the diced sausage. I used a can (2 cups) of chicken broth instead of 1 cup, and cooked it down a bit longer (like 30 minutes) which gave the flavors time to "meld" and thickened it up some. Spouse thought it was a tad salty, which could have been my fault from using twice as much broth and cooking it down. Next time I'll use low sodium broth, and maybe No Salt Added beans. Sprinkled some grated cheddar on top. Good recipe, a bit unusual, but quick and easy. Will make again with low sodium ingredients.

Wow! Absolutely delicious! I made exactly as the recipe stated and my family loved it. We didn't have any leftovers. Seriously simple, easy, and delicious. This one is going into the keep on hand ingredients so I can whip it up whenever I need a quick meal! Served with cornbread.

Smoked Sausage White Bean Chili Haiku: "Onion, garlic too. This really was amazing! I simmered all day." Browned 1/2 onion chopped and 1 minced garlic clove w/ the sausage, and then served ours w/ an easy biscuit recipe, shredded cheese, and chopped cilantro: we fell in love w/ this "chili." But what put it over the top was I simmered the leftovers the next day w/ a huge handful of kale, and added a splash of Chipotle Tabasco -- /drool. I'm more tempted to call it "Soup" than chili, but whatever it was in my bowl made me, my chompers, my belly, and my family crazy happy.

This was fantastic! My family loved it as written, but when I made a few alterations they liked it even better. They wanted a few more beans, so I added one more can of beans and half to a full can of chopped chilies. I also added a little more liquid so it was a tad more soupy. May need a little more spices to taste if you're making liquid and bean adjustments. Definitely top with an extra sharp cheddar and some parsley (we also tried cilantro, but it was better with parsley believe it or not!).

Very flavorful!  Because we enjoy some heat, I substituted 1 seeded and minced jalapeno for the green chilies, and added 1/2 of a minced onion when I browned the sausage.  As someone else did, I used the entire can of chicken broth and simmered twice as long.  For chili powder, I used 1 t. chili powder, 1/2 t. hot chili powder, and 1/2 t. chipotle chili powder.  This recipe comes together quickly.  We'll definitely be making this again.

This was a delicious recipe. I didn't use canned beans, because I didn't have any. However, I did cook dried white beans and proceeded with the recipe. I also used red pepper flakes instead of the green chilies; again, because that's what I had on hand!
One of the other reviewers suggested this was more of a soup so I used corn starch to thicken.
I will add the green chilies to my next grocery run and will definitely make this again. The family enjoyed this chili.

I make this all the time.  I changed a few things to our taste.  I use chilli seasoning mix, and canned petite diced tomatoes along with the sausage and beans . I also omit the green chilies since we don't care for them. We then garnish with sour cream.
It's even better the next day!

This was very good, but I did add/substitute a few things to make it a little more hearty and more like a soup. I used cannellini beans instead of great Northern, and added a chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic, yellow & red bell pepper (browned with sausage), coarsely chopped carrot, a can of ranch style beans, 2 cups of water, and some oregano. Simmered for about an hour and took off the lid at the end to reduce and thicken. Delicious!

I made this recipe while we were snowed in.  It was my first time trying chili using smoked sausage.  So, I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  That was a waste of worry!  My family absolutely loved it!  It was even better the next day!  We had itwith brunch.  i will definitely be making this one again.   The only thing missing was cornbread!

This was pretty good and mild, can't really call it chili.  Next time I'm definitely adding onions and garlic, maybe some oregano.  It just needs more spices.  I did use turkey smoked sausage though so that might have added to the mildness.

I doubled the broth and added rice.  Was very tasty! The whole family loved it.  Was a little spicy for one of my kids so I’ll do less chili powder next time.

We loved this chili! I used one can of tri colored beans and one can of black beans. Also only used half of the chili powder and half of the cumin because I didn't want it too spicy. Next time I'll use 3/4 of the called for amounts of seasonings. Excellent, quick meal.

I just made the simple basic recipe with a few additions. I did not think this would taste so rich & complex with so few ingredients so I was very surprised! Optional additions I did: sautéed onions, peppers, some leftover herb rice, & corn. I used canelli beans instead of northern since that’s what I had.

I utilized this to get rid of some leftover sausage that was at the end of fridge life. I had 3 cheap bratwurst-sized polish sausages and kept the rest of the measurements as close as I could. I didn't have any green chiles so I sauteed half an onion with the sausage and crushed up a can of whole tomatoes. I didn't use all the juice in the can, only as much as I needed to up the flavor. I generously seasoned it with cumin, cayenne, and hot sauce. Topped with cheese and ate it with tortilla chips. It became a kind of thick dip almost. Certainly not health food, but incredibly helpful in on a frugal day and it *really* stuck to my ribs.

Great flavor. So easy! Made only two changes - added a little cornstarch (1 tablespoon with little water) to thicken it, and cooked it for about half an hour while I made some cornbread.  Will definitely make again - highly recommend!

It's awfully salty as written, so I didn't like it on its own, but I really like it mixed with white rice to balance out the excess sodium.

We loved this, but I did make some changes.  I used Country Style bulk sausage  and used a whole can of chicken broth along with 2 cans of white beans and an extra can of Tri-Bean blend.   We added chopped green onions along with sour cream and grated cheese when serving.

I used canned white beans in chili sauce and didn't drain.  I didn't need as much chicken broth (1/4 cup).  As suggested by others, I added onion.  I also added  a small amount of brown sugar (maybe 1T).  This was super quick and easy to make and was enjoyed by the whole family.

Super easy! I just added some tobacco, a little lime juice, and some cheese before serving. Great for a weeknight meal!

This is a nice, easy recipe for those days you want something quick and yummy before running out the door.  I would add a little onion the next time but it was good just as it is.

Liked by all!  I used some white kidney beans and some great northern beans, but otherwise did as written.  Served with cheddar cheese and some cornbread.  Yum!

This is a nice recipe, but I did think it needed some onion and garlic. I ended up adding dried minced onion and garlic powder for flavor. I will make this again (DH really liked it, and it was SO easy), but I will saute an onion and some garlic first, then add the sausage. I mashed some of the beans and simmered a bit longer than suggested. I also added cilantro at the end. This reminds me more of a bean soup than chili, and my DH really likes bean soup.

Delicious.  Had a ton of flavor.  Did add 1 extra can of beans.  Next time I will cut the sausage in smaller pieces.  My pieces were kind of hard to eat.  I used kielbasa for the sausage.  Loved it.

I made two versions of this, one with hot beef smoked sausage, one with chicken sausage.  I too added onion and garlic to both and added fresh spinach to the chicken sausage version.  We both really enjoyed it.

My daughter-in-law made this and served it with a tossed salad.  Although I was full with one bowl, I was a bit disappointed there wasn't enough for seconds, not to mention leftovers the next day!  Such a quick and simple recipe that is great as is, but I'd love to try adding some other veggies when I make this...maybe some red peppers or tomato for color.  I will definitely be making a trip to the store when I get home so I can make this soon!

This was a big hit in our house.  Added 1/2 of a medium yellow onion and 2 cloves of chopped garlic and sauteed them in a little olive oil to start.  I removed them from the dutch oven and followed the recipe after that (added the onions and garlic to the sausage with the other ingredients).  This was very simple and quick and was good comfort food on a cold winter evening.

I used ground bison instead of sausage, a small chopped onion mixed in, fresh green chilies, & chicken stock instead of broth. The results? Delicious!
