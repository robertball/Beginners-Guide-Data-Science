I made this salad in 15 minutes, it is so easy.  I used Italian Pesto Salad Dressing.  This is perfect as a side dish or for lunch.

This bean salad was super easy and very tasty.  I also added a can of drained, cut string beans and a few diced scallions for extra flavor.  Yum!

This is so easy and nutritious!  I added some chopped onion and used Roma tomatoes instead of the red peppers.  Very good.

This is a quick and simple recipe.  My family loves it and the longer it is in the fridge the better it gets.  They continue to ask for it afte it is gone.
We had a similar recipe years ago and nobody has used in awhile.  Everyone loved it.
Thanks for the great ideas and recipes.  After 35 years of cooking it helps to recall old recipes and try new ones.

My  husband adored this.  I, too, thought it was very good.  The kids (2 and 5) wouldn't touch it, but I'll keep trying!

I didn't really care for this as the texture of the three beans put together wasn't very appealing. Instead of throwing it away, though, I put it in the food processor and made it into a "spread" that I put on crackers and also on a tortilla with turkey, romaine, and swiss cheese. I might make this again, but as a spread instead of a salad.
