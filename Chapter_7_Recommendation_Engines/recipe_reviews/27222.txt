This is a fabulous cheese cake I have made for 5 years.  It is even better when made w/ a pre-fab graham cracker crust (get the extra serving size). I'm so happy to have the recipe print-out.  I've been using the tiny recipe from the top of the condensed milk can, and the letters are getting smaller all the time :)

Think I would give this five stars plus, if that were an option.  This was such a big hit for Thanksgiving.  Just a couple of tweaks I'll mention -- used a graham cracker crust. Also, after reading a couple of comments on too-sweet canned cranberries, I made my own, ("Cranberry Sauce I", I belive -- 1 c. o.j., 12 oz of fresh cranberries and just 3/4 cup sugar, instead of the 1 c. called for, cook for about 10 min.) so I could control the sugar (obviously).  Anyway, like I said, HUGE hit at our house -- thanks for a great recipe!!!

Rich and sweet. For the life of me I can't figure out how all of that recipe was supposed to fit into a 9" pie crust... and I even had the deep dish crust. So my pie didn't turn out visually very nice (in fact it oozed out everywhere), but so what! It tasted great, and we just pretended it was a cobbler, instead! :) I'd like to experiment with a little cinnamon and/or nutmeg in this recipe next time.

This pie became a personal tradition of mine!  It's rich and creamy, while the cranberry sauce adds a wonderful tartness and then it's topped off by a golden nutty crunch. I've made it probably 8 times and it aways turns out beautifully.  A real crowd pleaser!  I find it's even better when chilled overnight in the fridge.

Yummy!  This pie was delicious!  I was dubious about putting it in the oven, but I did anyway and it turned out great!  I did a couple of things differently.  First, I added the brown sugar to the crumb mixture instead of the cranberry mixture.  I also ommited the cornstarch.  I basically just put the cranberry sauce on top.  I also used a graham cracker crust.  I'll be making this again!

This was a delicious pie, although I gave it 4 stars because the cranberries were a little too sweet.  I would absolutely make this again as is, but I'd also like to try using fresh cranberries and making my own cranberry sauce to make it less sweet.  Everyone loved this one.  I think it would also be good with a graham cracker crust, since it is basically a cheescake.

This is a great recipe!  I used low-fat sweetened condensed milk and reduced fat cream cheese.  My husband never suspected that it was low-fat.  I am planning to make one for his company's Thanksgiving covered dish - he thinks they will love it.

Okay so I did switch the fruit up a bit and went with fresh raspberries and blackberries (currently in season) but I kept everything else the same and it was delicious! This is a keeper!

i just brought this to a potluck today. it got rave reviews. there were several desserts but this one was the only one that had people going back for seconds! i made my own cranberry sauce (simmer 15 mins until thickened - 2c. cranberries, 1c. sugar, 1/2c. orange juice) and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  i have also tried this with an almond crumb crust and topping and i think i liked that even better. (in a food processor combine 1c. flour, 2 1/2 cups ground almonds, 3/4c. sugar, 3/4 c. butter. pulse until clumps form. reserve 1.5 cups for the topping then press the rest into the pie plate, no need to prebake crust)

Basically, this is a good recipe, however, I think the canned cranberry sauce is too sweet for the already sweet filling.  I'm going to try making it with freshly cooked cranberries that I won't sweetened too much.  I relate this recipe to the one that calls for the sour cherries and I like that better.

Soo good!  I feel this recipe really needs to be cooled AND chilled before serving.  Cut into the pie after a couple hours of cooling on a rack and the cheesecake layer had a very odd texture... but excellent the next morning.

I used a small pie pan and had leftover ingredients, and after a bit of thinking I took some foil muffin liner, pressed the crumb mixture at the bottom of each one, filled them half full with the cheesecake mixture, and spooned the cranberry mixture on top of them, then baked them for a short amount of time (forgot to keep track). They turned out wonderfully, and the next time I make this recipe I think I'll cut out the pie part entirely and make miniature cheesecake cups!

This was wonderful! My husband kept raving about it. I did use a graham cracker crust instead of a regular crust, the first time and the second time I used individual graham cracker crust which made them perfect.

I didn't care for this pie but with several tweaks it could be good.  The crumb topping wasn't that great, I think I would omit the flour next time.  The creamcheese turned gritty the next day.  Plus there was so much of the cranberry misture left over.  A graham cracker crust would have been better.

This was definitely better after being refrigerated overnight.  One problem I had is that the cranberry sunk right through the cream cheese layer before I could spread it evenly.  I also wished for more tartness in the cranberry layer.  But it tasted good and I would probably make it again.

Great pie!!  I use a graham cracker crust (extra serving size) It's rich, smooth, and not too sweet because of the cranberries. A very simple recipe, and it's a hit every time I make it! Definately a keeper...

This was a huge hit, but I did have to make some alterations to make it perfect. Like other reviews suggested, I made a Graham cracker crust. I didn't add sugar to the cranberry sauce, and I put the brown sugar in the nut crumble topping instead. I also made this in a 10" tart pan instead of a pie pan, and it fit perfectly, looked beautiful as a tart, and was a big crowd pleaser!

Went over really well for thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.   Not too hard to make.  Used fresh cranberry recipe instead of can.  Will make this a tradition every year.

I've made this pie several times for family gatherings using different nuts in the topping.  This pie comes out perfectly everytime and is as beautiful to look at as it is wonderful to eat.

I took this pie to our 20009 family Christmas gathering and it was a hit.  Very tasty and turned out great.  I give it 4 stars because I veered from the original recipe and made it with a shortbread crust instead.  I also used 1/2 a can of jellied cranberry sauce and a 1/2 cup of whole (defrosted) cranberries.  Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I found this recipe a few years ago and have made it every Thanksgiving. It is wonderful as is,but I too have had problems with it spilling over. The sweet, with the tangy and the crunch on top is a perfect combo. The only thing I do different is use pecan pieces cause I don't like walnuts. Would definitely recommend trying.

I agree with KVICKRY's comments.  We didn't eat it until the next day and the cheesecake part was mealy and crumbly.  I liked the lemon flavor though - not overpowering.  I did enjoy the nut topping.  If I made again, I would use a graham cracker crust.

This is tasty.  But I agree with others, it would be good in a graham cracker crust.  Also, I may try using  fresh cranberries on top instead of pre-made sauce.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I received nothing but praise.  Everyone loved it.  Not one slice was left.  It's perfect for the holidays.  I plan to make it for Christmas.  The pie is not too sweet and has a nice blend of flavors.

I would give this 5 stars if I would have known I was making a cheesecake cranberry pie before hand.  As cheesecake goes, this is scrumptous but I'm not much of a cheesecake fan.  Please-change the title to reflect what kind of pie it is!

I use the deep dish pie crusts but find that the recipe overflows and looks messy so this time I did not pour the cream cheese mixture or the cranberry mixture so full and it turned out perfect!

This is a pretty amazing pie with a graham cracker crust.  I didn't add quite as much sugar to the cranberry sauce; I thought that was sweet enough.  I found the crumb topping to be lacking, so I bulked it up with oatmeal.  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.

I made this for my family at thanksgiving and they loved it! Even the "dessert snobs" loved it. I did end up adding a little more flour to the topping mix because it was too sticky... but other than that, I found the recipe perfect and not too sweet. The only people that would find this too sweet are the same ones that will say some desserts are "too rich".

Surprisingly delicious! I guess I always expected cranberry flavored things to be less sweet, but this one was the perfect amount of sweetness. I actually made everything from scratch, including the crust and the cranberry sauce, and it came out wonderfully. Everybody loved it, and this was the winner over a pumpkin cheesecake served at the same Thanksgiving dinner.

I rated it five star because my step daughter ate two pieces and doesn't eat sweets ever.and her spouse asked for the recipe.    That was Thanksgiving 09 and am now making it for another part of the family Christmas dinner.  I'll tell you how they rate it.  I went down to give my husband a piece the day after Thanksgiving and my 14 year old son and taken what was left to his bedroom late that night.

This was easy to make and tasted great.  I made it for the first time for a small dinner party.  I served it at room temp.  Everyone loved it.  The next day I had a piece from the refig and it was fab!!! Next time I will serve it cold.

Made this for Thanksgiving today and it was a big hit! I followed this recipe exactly but used a graham cracker crust (the larger size that has "two extra servings"). I didn't have any problem with spillage... it was actually quite perfect. I will definitely be making this again!
