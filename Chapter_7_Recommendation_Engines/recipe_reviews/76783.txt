I make this 2-3 times a week because I can't get enough of it! I have started making it in the microwave. I put the PB, honey and cinnamon in a glass measuring cup and put in the microwave for 1 min. then I stir it and microwave it for 1 more min. After its done I stir in the vanilla then pour it over the oats in a large mixing bowl. I've used the figs(they're very yummy) but I don't think its any better than a mix of raisins and craisins(what I usually use). I also always use diff. nuts because I don't like peanuts very much. I've used almonds, walnuts and pistachios that I roasted during the last 10 mins. of baking the granola. They all tasted great. All in all this recipe is very versatile! Sometimes I throw in extra oats (like 4 1/2 cups total) for a slightly dryer granola or I'll add these instant steel cut oats called "Coach's Oats" and it doesn't taste any different but is healthier. I usually use all natural PB (just mashed peanuts) and I haven't noticed a big difference between salted/unsalted or smooth/crunchy. It does taste sweeter if you use regular PB but its still delicious w/the healthy kind! Even reduced fat PB tastes great!.

As a peanut butter lover, this is the BEST granola.  The first reviewer is correct, there should be 4 CUPS of oats added!!  I also added wheat germ, walnuts, and pumpkin seeds.

This is delicious!  I didn't follow exactly because I didn't have peanuts or figs, and I added wheat germ and flax seed.  This will be something that I keep on hand from now on.  I will try as written next time.  I think you can play around with this one and have amazing results.

Hmm. On one hand, the recipe's written with only 1 cup of oats; on the other hand, as many people have correctly pointed out, the recipe on Jif's site calls for 4 cups of oats - big discrepancy. I first tried the Jif site's recipe (4 cups oats), and found the mixture not unpleasant, but neither sweet nor PB-ery enough. Then I tried this one, and while it delivered much more PB flavor, I found it very sloppy and prone to burning in the oven. So I give up, and I'll just keep looking for a better recipe. I believe if the reviews for this recipe reflected the fact that many people used 4 cups of oats instead of 1, the overall rating would be much lower, so proceed with caution.

This is delicious!  I love being able to make my own granola without any preservatives.  I love the peanut butter/honey combo.  The recipe does, indeed, need 4 cups of oats and not 1.  I halved the recipe, and it still yielded about 3 1/2 cups.

This was good. If you are going to make it spend the extra dollar and get the Quaker oats. They seem to help keep the recipe from becoming "crumbly like". As you spread it on the baking sheet you can sqeeze the granola and it will make clusters.

I used Trader Joe's organic peanut butter. I didn't have figs so I added dried blueberries. The kids had this for breakfast this morning and I have to tell you.....it was absolutely silent. They enjoyed it to the point of no sound at the breakfast table. Win for mom and kids. I'm SO making this again, though I might try a different dried fruit next time. Maybe apples or cranberries? NOTE: I also checked the JIF website and their original recipe also called for four cups of oats, so that's what I went with. If it wasn't for AMIEH's review, I would have had a mess on my hands.

I think it is better with 4 cups of oats, not 1.  Everything else is the same and it is the best granola I've ever had!

I added chocolate chips to mine, which ended up melting over the clusters.  It turned out fantastic. The only thing I left out was peanuts, but that's only because I forgot at the store.  Next time, I'll definately make sure to grab some. I actually didn't like the taste that much(not sweet enough for me), at first, but then I found that I couldn't stop eating it.  Rather than putting it all in one container, I put it in a bunch of smaller ones so I wouldn't eat it all at once.

This recipe was awesome! Of course you need 4 cups of rolled oats, but if you run out of them you can always substitute in cereal! I made this recipe twice and ran out of rolled oats so I added some cheerios which was a great addition! Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. I thought it was OK. I was expecting a bit more from all of the reviews. Probably won't make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't turn out very good. It didn't seem to have enough flavor for me. Also I think the oven temp should be lower, mine started "burning" after only 20 minutes at 300. I don't think I'll try this again

This is highly addictive!!! Even my kids like it far more than I was expecting! Love it and can't wait to experiment with some add-ins and variations. And YES you do need 4 cups of oats, NOT 1!

My peanut butter-loving husband loves this.  I use chunky peanut butter instead of creamy & leave out the nuts & figs.  Very easy to make!

Very easy, you can change the recipe to fit what you have on hand.  Definately make again.  I used almonds and more oats instead of peanuts and figs

Great recipe.  Even though I didn't make it exactly per the recipe, I gave it a 5 because the flavor was fantastic.  I tweaked it per what I had on hand.  It was great, and I'm sure it would be even better made per the recipe. My tweaks... I added 1 cup each of rolled barley, rolled rye flakes, sweetened coconut, flax seed, roasted sunflower seeds to the oatmeal.  I didn't have peanuts or figs on hand, so I didn't add those.  I also added 2 egg whites to the peanut butter / honey mix. Everything else, I kept the same.  I suspect these would also be good baked into granola bars.  Thanks JIF!  Love this recipe.

I used all natural peanut butter instead of Jif, and it worked great! I left out the dried fruit because my husband doesn't care for it. He loved this!

it's healthier than a no-bake and tastes just as good:) I took a bag to school every day this week and it was such a satisfying snack.  I didn't add dried figs or peanuts, and added 1 crushed up bar of Hershey's milk chocolate.  and it smells great while it's baking- my roommates were drooling all around the apartment!!

Liked it as is but loved it the  2nd time I made it!, I used multigrain hot cereal (oats, barley, wheat, quinoa, rye and flaxseed) added salted almonds instead of peanuts and some sunflower seeds. Remember to bake it on parchment paper and there's no mess to clean up! This is a must in our house and now the neighborhood kids ask for it when they come over!

I made this for a birthday gift, and it was a huge hit. This granola is so delicious. I did not add any figs. I highly recommend this to any granola junkie.
