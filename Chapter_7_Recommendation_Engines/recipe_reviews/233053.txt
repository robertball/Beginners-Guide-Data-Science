I tried this recipe this weekend, and it was super easy to make and was a crowd-pleaser! I served with crackers and apples.

So easy to make and full of flavor.  In addition to serving over cream cheese as recommended by the recipe author, this would make a fantastic topping for crostini.  Thanks Alexis for sharing your recipe, this is a keeper.

Awesome recipe. Two garlic cloves were enough. I added fresh basil and used goat cheese instead, which took this to the next level. Wonderful flavour and texture. Can't wait to make it again.

Sooo easy and good! I added about 3/4 cup canned pitted green olives (not the kind you find in a jar in a pickle brine) just because we love this type of olive and 1/3 cup of chopped kalamata olives as the recipe states.  I added about a teaspoon of drained and chopped capers also! I used the olive the tomatoes were packed in.  VERY FLAVORFUL! Wonderful with the cream cheese but also very good spread onto crostini bread! Thank you Alexis! This is a keeper!

This is  delicious with a few alterations:  I use Mezzeta Garlic-Stuffed Green olives, reserving the pickled garlic to be used in the recipe (because it's milder than raw garlic, use 5-6 cloves);  a 3oz bag of smoked,  julienned California sun-dried tomatoes (chopped, no oil); finally, I serve it over goat cheese.

Simply wonderful! I have made this recipe several times and never have any leftover. Delicious! The only change  I've made is that I use oven-dried tomatoes from my garden.

Fantastic!  I  actually just used 3/4 of the sun dried tomatoes that the recipe called for and it turned out wonderful. I used 3 huge cloves of garlic but stuck to the original recipe.  I served it with a garlic infused crusty french bread and it was sublime.

YES, use the oil the tomatoes came in. This dish is now at the top of my peoples’ list of what they want me to bring to our gatherings.  Thank goodness, it’s so easy to make.

Very good!  Unfortunately I could only find the sweet california sun dried tomatoes and yes it was a little sweeter.  Didn't stop the rave compliments.  I will look for the other tomatoes next time.

Liked the tanginess and saltiness; nice balance. Preferred having with the  texture and light flavor of goat cheese than the cream cheese. Served with 'party bread' and water crackers.

I added capers and used goat cheese instead.  I found it helpful to use a food chopper for the olives but  sun dried tomatoes don't work in the chopper.  The tapenade keeps for a good long time.

I used extra black olives and extra green olives, but those were the only changes that I made.  It was absolutely fantastic!!  I made it for my boyfriend and we both loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.  This will be making an appearance at my house quite a bit!
