As a side note, I always chuckle when people rate a recipe without first trying it "as-written" and then say it isn't good. With this recipe in particular, following the instructions at least once is lesson in learning you won't regret. We were very impressed with this chili.  We did make it as written, the only variable being the "dark beer" we selected (since the recipe doesn't specify a brand).  We chose not to use Guiness and used a locally brewed dark that's a bit less sweet since previous reviews had suggested that the recipe had too much sugar. I'd have to agree.  Next time we make it (and it was good enough that there will be a next time!), we'll cut back on cocoa and just a bit on the sugar, as other reviewers suggested.  That said, as-is, it's an excellent recipe. I strongly encourage you to make it exactly as written first, so you know what adjustments you need to suit your taste--it's not "too" anything--it has a nice mix of sweet and spice and it's hard to say how much you'll need to adjust to suit your taste.  The balance of flavors is really quite impressive. In other regards, the texture, consistency, and ratio of meat & beans is just right.

I made this recipe for an informal chili "contest" among friends and was disappointed that the flavor was too sweet.  However, when I pulled the leftovers out of my refridgerator the next day, the flavors had mingled and mellowed into something I can only describe as fantastic!  If you're making the chili to eat the same day, decrease the sugar, by all means.  But if you've got the time, let the pot chill; the result is well worth the wait.

absolutely amazing...I've actually been making this chili since last fall, but haven't rated it. as the weather has been a bit like fall here, it was time to bring out the famed chili recipe. three people stopped by sunday and decided to stay for dinner after sticking their fingers in the pot....they're still talking about it! I only use 1 chili pepper and 1 TBLSPN chili powder so it's not so spicy. I use guiness beer, espresso, 1 large can kidney beans, 1 large can pinto beans, and 1 small can black beans instead of entirely kidney. I teamed it with the amusement park cornbread recipe on this site...another fabulous find! thank you, thank you!

Bob's was the first chili recipe I found with over 300 reviews, so I knew it must have something unique going for it.  I read the last 50 or so reviews and modifications, finding that the majority of reviewers commented on the marked enhancement of flavors when the chili was prepared a day in advance.  Being a person who likes only mildly spicy food (my forehead starts to drip) I could see that modifications to the underlying spiciness would be easy.  I like anything with beer in it (especially my stomach) and chocolate is also a favorite.  My wife responded that with these flavors, it might be more Mexican.

My recipe modifications consisted of following others' lead and mixing the type of beans (1 can kidney, black, chili and Great Northern), reducing the sugar a bit, also I substituted 3/4 # of coarsely ground beef for the sirloin. I like a thicker chili so I poured off the liquid of all but the chili beans, as they were in a "chili sauce" with cumin and cayenne.  I used only 2 hot chili peppers, finely chopped, and reduced the chili powder to about 2 1/2 T.  I had some Bitburger Bier and knew that it was a bit more "hoppy" or bitter, but I think any beer will do.  My preparation modifications consisted of mixing all but the cooked ingredients first and letting them cohabit in the frig for several hours.  I started the simmering process as I began to prepare the meat, onions and garlic, then mixed them into the simmering pot and let it carry on for a couple of hours.  Th

Excellent Chili recipe. I love it because it has so much rich flavor, not just a tomato based chili flavor. The steak chunks are perfectly tender and delicious.

Made this last night for the 6th time. I finally have it down with modifications. The suggestions I have are 1. Use 1\4 cup brown sugar, I got many "too sweet" complaints. 2. Drain and rinse beans before adding. 3. Bump Ground beef to 1 1\2 pounds and sirloin to at least 1 pound. 4. Use other beans besides Kidney, I split 50-50 between black and dark red kidney. 5. Add a second can of diced tomatoes.

The chili is much better the next day, my wife said it is the best batch so far. If you use 4 jalapeno peppers I think it gives a perfect medium heat on the chili.

Hi Everyone. I am the original poster of this recipe. I posted it back in 2000 under the name ROBTX99, which I no longer use. I want to thank everyone for their great reviews, and suggestions. I spent a few years developing this recipe until I got just how I wanted it. I also now reduce the sugar a little at the suggestion of reviews received. Someone recently posted that this is a copy of a recipe used by Sam Adams. Not sure where that came from since this is my orignal recipe that I have been making since the 1990's. It has won numerous chili cookoffs over the years. Thanks again and ENJOY!

Made this the other night for the family.  I used Samuel Adams Black Lager for the beer, Starbucks Christmas Blend for the coffee and homemade veal stock I keep on hand for the beef broth. I also used half kidney beans, half black.  

I used four different peppers that looked good in the market at the time. In this case 1 Anaheim, 1 Serrano, 1 Jalape√±o and 1 Poblano--these are mostly on the less hot side of the Scoville scale.  People, when the recipe calls for "hot chile peppers" you're not going to find them in the market marked as such, there are MANY kinds of chile peppers and the ones you choose will make your recipe more or less hot.  For example, if you replaced Habanero for the Anaheim in the peppers I used you'd have a MUCH higher heat content. 
It turned really well.  My wife--not a big chili fan--loved it.  I used the full brown sugar and liked the sweetness.  I would recommend trying it full sugar first to see if you prefer it that way.  It starts out sweet and the chili peppers kick in as an after-taste.  Served it with cheddar corn bread and the leftover beer and it was a big hit.  The next day it was even better as the flavors come together and sirloin really tenderizes while marinating in the chili overnight.

My only complaint is that it had too many beans.  But that's a personal preference. Next time I'll cut the beans in half and add more meat instead.

This chili is awesome!!!!!  The sweetness balances out the spiciness; the spiciness brings out the sweetness.  A perfect combination. This recipe was such a hit!!  I was a bit skeptical about some of the ingredients and had to put a little $$ into buying the spices, but ohmigod, is it worth it!  I used just ground beef, and also wasn't sure which peppers to buy, so I used the ones labeled "long hot peppers", which added only a green pepper flavor.  Absolutely DO NOT leave out the cayenne pepper!!!  I did the first time and it was okay, just a little blah.  My second batch I added the cayenne and WOW, what a difference.  Probably could leave out the cayenne if you used hotter peppers like jalapeno or serrano, etc.  This recipe is a definite "keeper" and is definitely worth the extra prep work and buying the extra spices that I didn't have on hand.  I will definitely be making this chili again.  I usually hate chunks of vegetables but it all cooks down together and is soooo good!  The addition of coffee, cocoa, and dark beer "scared" me at first since i don't like beer and had never used coffee and cocoa in anything other than desserts, but NO WORRIES, MON.  Don't be scared.  This stuff is awesome exactly as the author wrote it!!!

The thing I regret most about this recipe is that I HAD to sample it before serving and then I was too full by dinner time!  I did, on the other hand watch my husband go back again & again!  I browned the ground beef & sirloin, drained it & threw it in the crock pot for 7 hours (it was still sweet after about 4 hours, so I let it keep going).  I will add a little more "heat" next time (we like it hot & the kids eat my regular version).  Thanks Bob!

I found that the taste was much better the day after the chili was made.  This recipe was a lot of work compared with my other dishes and I am not sure if it was worth the effort.

Best chili ever!  I love the unique flavor that the coffee, beer and cocoa add!!  I did however change the recipe a bit after trying it.  First off, I agree with several other reviewers about cutting down on the brown sugar.  The original version was much too sweet for me! Also, I only use top sirloin (or any roast that I find on sale) and no ground beef.  I cube the meat and marinate it overnight in my crockpot in the fridge with the onions, garlic, beer, coffee, beef broth, sugar, peppers and all the spices.  Next morning, I turn on the crockpot and let it cook all day while I'm at work.  When I get home, I add the diced tomotoes, tomato paste and kidney beans and cook for another 1/2 hr or so.  Using the crockpot is the least work for me and gives me a great chili with very tender meat chunks.  Yummy!  Thanks Bob!!

This is great chili!  There is absolutely nothing ordinary about this recipe- which is what made me want to try this.  I love the fact that it is a blend of odd ingredients and not the usual bland, easy, safe route!  I blended all the wet ingredients into a dutch oven and refrigerated it for 24 hours- giving it a chance to meld.  Then I added the meat and let it simmer for 2 hours.  I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cans of pintos.  Omitted the corriander (which was $5.00 a bottle) and cut the sugar in half like others suggested.  I, too, added an extra tablespoon of chili powder (4 1/2 total).  It was so good!  I used low sodium broth and forgot the salt (!).  It needed it.  Next time I wont forget the salt!  Try this recipe.  You will be so proud of the results!  It is a keeper!!

Complete update from 8/2011 review. It's 8 yrs later and I've made this recipe w/my own personal tweaks at least 2 x's a year. VERY versatile recipe you can modify knowing your own likes, heat level, etc.  I used to modify the entire batch with heat level but I now remove a 3rd before adding any wake you up type chili peppers (it's only  1  person that can't take ANY heat). However to start: I use 3 oz  tomato paste, I use my own beef bone broth but only  1 cup. I only add 2 can's of beans (blk and drk red kidney). I grow my own tomatoes so I can a few 32 oz jar w/Hatch chili peppers just for making this. I defo reduce the sweet level and use a healthy tsp of black-strap molasses with a few drops of liquid sucralose. (I don't even own normal sugar anymore). The cocoa powder is still 1 rounded tsp. The beer: I prefer to use an Amber style as the dark can be a little overwhelming.  I still use all coarse ground sirloin or lean organic ground beef because that's just how I roll. I now add one of those stick packets of freeze dried coffee instead of more liquid. I brown the beef/onions/garlic with seasoning together and then simmer with the beer/coffee/cocoa/beef stock for about an hour prior to adding in anything else. Once I incorporate the tomatoes, paste and beans in, I remove 4 cups then add to the rest at least 2 jalapeno's, more Hatch peppers/chili powder (I make a blend as well)  and well, more of most all spices.  Once I get it spicy enough for myself - both parts get re

Very good! Really good! I did use just half the brown sugar, otherwise I made this recipe to the tee. Actually, it's very close to the chili I usually make, but this has the cocoa powder, coriander and coffee added to it, which I feel adds a very nice body.  Most wonderful. I give it a 10-fart salute!!!  √ú

Made this last night, following the suggestion to cut back on the brown sugar.  Used Sam Adams Chocolate Bock, and a tablespoon of instant coffee (I had a request not to make it too watery) and the flavors were great.  I left out the chiles, as my chili seasoning blend has a lot of heat.  When I mentioned the ingredients, I got some strange looks, but we all agreed it had wonderful depth and flavor.  Will be making it again, and may be adding some ground chipotle for an ever richer taste.

Nice complexity of flavors!  I had no sirloin, so I used all ground beef, ground cumin instead of cumin seed, one large jalapeno instead of the 4 chili peppers, and I added 1/4 cup cornmeal to the mix as my family likes the hint of masa flavor.  After browning the ground beef, onions and garlic, I threw it all in the crock pot for the afternoon.  Next time I will use just 1/4 cup of brown sugar as this batch was just a tad too sweet for our taste.  Overall, a winner!

I know I don't need to add more stars but this recipe deserves it! I've been making this for over a year now and it's a hit every time. I make extra and freeze it because it's that good! I double the ground beef because my boyfriend loves meaty chili and use a full pound of steak. I also use fresh cut roma tomatoes and don't worry about peeling or seeding them. I also use two cans kidney beans, one can black beans, and one can pinto beans and Killian's beer. I have never heard a bad word about this chili. Use all ingredients, don't be afraid of the strange ones! I serve with Cinnamon Rolls III from this site which are to die for as well. Yum! ****Update**** I just finished putting all ingredients in to the crock pot and came online to check out new reviews. I noticed the nutrition information for this recipe and got to thinking. The recipe never states that the meat should be drained, but I always do. I probably stand there straining for a good minute and a half w/ a steady stream of grease coming out of the pan. I think this greatly reduces the caloric content w/o sacrificing taste, in my opinion. Also, I am a believer in draining and rinsing the beans before adding them as this will wash off lots of sodium. With salt already added to the chili, it doesn't need any more. I also add an extra can of tomato paste and two small cans of tomato sauce since I use fresh tomatoes. Still a fantastic fall recipe. This is the first time we've had this meal since winter and I can't wait!

First off I have to say, this is NOT a chili for those who like the "Chili-in-a-box", or the Chili spice or chili-mix-in-a-box that you buy at the store.
This is for the more bold of us who love to search and find a blend of different chili recipes to have to on hand to suit the most varying of tastes.
This one is a KILLER recipe, worth purchasing every spice, beer, and as mentioned different chili's to use.
I baked cheese & corn bread right on top of this chili for a complete meal and it was extra extrodinary.
My hats off to you Bob!

How many reviews are we up to now?  It doesn't matter; this recipe is incredible and deserves all the praise it can get!  I planned on making it one night and then got called out to dinner with a friend.  I put all the components together in bowls (step 1 in one bowl and step 2 in another) and left them in the fridge for 3 or 4 days before actually cooking.  By this time, the beer had gone flat, but no worries.  I think the flavors all melded nicely in the fridge and my first bite of this coffee-chocolate-beer concoction knocked my socks off.  DO NOT HALF THIS RECIPE!  You'll regret it as you'll wish you had more of this wonderful dish.  I used 2 jalapenos and one long green chili (anaheim?) but found it could use even more spice than that.  Enjoy!  Thanks Bob!

This was amazing chili bursting with incredible flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but added quite a few splashes of Tobasco for more heat.  The next time I make this (and there will be a next time!!!), I will adjust with a few changes -- add more cubed sirloin, drain the beef mixture after browning, and also drain the kidney beans.  The recipe didn't call for these steps, and I thought the mixture came out very soupy.  I had to add some dissolved corn starch during the last 1/2 hour of cooking to thicken it up a bit.  I may also add an additional can of diced tomatoes (drained) as I like the texture of having more tomato pieces.

IF YOU PLAN ON ADDING CORN CHIPS TO THE TOP OF YOUR CHILI, THIS RECIPE IS NOT FOR YOU.  This chili is a perfect 10. Doubters don't be fooled; this is not your average, run of the mill chili that we have all gotten used to eating, but what my wife affectionately coined, "the Beef Wellington of Chili."   I changed nothing (although I doubled the cubed sirlion and added ground sirlion instead of straight gound beef) and could not believe the wonderful flavors this chili produced.  It was unlike anything we had ever tasted.  All of the other postings say how good this chili is the next day;  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow.  Thank you so much Bob, this is by far the best recipe I have ever encountered on allrecipe.com.

David and a very happy Wife

I had doubts about the cocoa powder and beer, but I tried it anyway. I can't believe how subtle the two ingredients turned out to be, and it's amazing how complimentary they are to this recipe. Those two things really make the chili! I brought some chili into work and every single person loved it! It's that good. I left out the jalepenos as a personal preference, and in the future I'll leave out the sirloin.  Ground beef is enough as far as meat is concerned. I'll be making this again.

The worst chili recipe I have ever encountered.  I don't understand, I could swear that I cooked it exactly as listed, but did half the brown sugar.  I slow cooked for 10 hours, and it came out bitter tasting with the taste of coffee and beer very prevalent.  I almost want to try again because with that many reviews, I MUST have messed up somewhere, however I don't want to waste my money on it.  Sorry.  :-(

I don't know how, with all the diverse tastes people have, that this chili can satisfy everyone--but it does.  I had men tell me that this is the best chili they've had in their lives!  (I followed the recipe exactly, using mild chili peppers.)  It tasted a bit different each time I made it--and when my mother made it--but I recommend following the recipe exactly.  It'll taste even better the next day.

I liked (not loved) this chili, but left out a tbsp of chili powder, only added 1 chili pepper and substituted pinto and white beans for the kidney beans.  Also, another reviewer said they definitely could taste the beer and coffee in the recipe, but my family (who doesn't like beer or coffee) couldn't taste either at all!  Also, I really love sweet things, but this was a little too sweet with the whole 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

Absolutely my fave chili recipe. One pound of ground beef is enough, also reduced the beans down to 3 cans (2 kidney, 1 chili bean). Increased tomatos to 2 cans since I omited the coffee. Used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Used one anaheim pepper, chopped. Added in paprika and pepper. I threw it all into the crock pot on high for 3-4 hours.

Perhaps my hopes were too high! I really didn't like this chili much, nor did any of my guests. It was sweet!!! I'm from Chicago, so maybe thats why I didn't care for this. Chicago style chili would never have even a hint of sweet.

Great chili recipe! I was a little apprehensive about the amount of sugar in this recipe so I cut it by half and it was fine. The cayennne pepper added the perfect amount of spice so I substituted mild peppers for the hot. The beer, coffee and cocoa powder give this dish a wonderful full bodied flavor. My husband is the chili maker in our family and he thought this was much better than his own.

This has definitely become my family's #! favourite chili recipe  over the years!  I love the perfect combination of the cocoa, coffee and beer and mixture of spices.  The ingredients blend together in such a way that the unique combination gets wild raves from everyone I've ever served it to!   The only thing I do differently is chop the beef sirloin into small cubes and brown it first, then add the ground beef, drain any grease and then add the onions garlic and after it's browned.   This recipe makes a large quantity and freezes very well - either in plastic freezer bags, or sometimes I also add both rice and corn as well (which accompanies this chili recipe to a T) in the same container for a fully prepared freezer meal to save for later.

O.k., so this chili was THE BEST EVER!  I am making mine in the slow cooker.  It will probably take forever to cook beacuse everytime I pass through the kitchen I lift the lid to have another taste.  
I didn't follow the recipe exactly though.  I used all ground beef.  I also added black beans, a can of corn, and mushrooms.  But as far as the beer, coffee, sugar, and cocoa go, I'll be using them when I make chili from now on.  
Oh, I also only used a third cup of brown sugar, and found the amount to be perfect.  
I LOVE the sweet taste with the background of heat.
I'm so excited about this chili that I can't stop typing about it!

This is the only chili I make..never any leftovers I have to hide a bowl if I want one the next day. I'v made a couple of changes tho. Instead of using ground beef and cubed serloin. I use 2Lbs of stew beef cut up into about 1 inch cubes. cook with onions and garlic just until browned. mix all the ingrediants as directed.I also add 1 tsp of cinnamon. verry tasty!!! I cook it on a crockpot about 6 hrs. for best results cook in a cast iron pot hanging from a tripod over an open fire.I serv the chili over fritos with sour cream and sharp chedder cheese on top. Just remember from there on out it will be your job to make the chili !!!!

My wife used this recipe in her company chili cookoff and won FIRST place. Even beating her boss whose been the reighning chili champ.. Wonderful recipe. This recipe is awesome!! We used 3 peppers instead of 4 and used 1/4 cup brown sugar rather then the full amount. The starbucks verona and the guiness worked well together.Cut down on the beans and added only two cans. It was the only crock pot that was sitting empty, ha ha. Thanks for the recipe bob, we are making another batch today..

Great, The kids loved this.  I used half the brown sugar, Guiness as the beer, added twice the amount of sirloin and two links of mild italian sausage. I cooked it all day so that the liquid cooked down and it was nice and thick at the end of the evening.

This was an excellent recipe, and an especially good "base" recipe to work from and change to suit your tastes.  The dark beer I used was from a local brewery and was Dogfish Head Chicory Stout, I also used chopped chipotle peppers in adobe sauce instead of regular hot peppers; 1 can kidney beans, 2 cans black beans, and 1 can pinto beans; and chicory coffee. The chicory flavors of the stout and coffee went really well with the brown sugar and cocoa flavor, and all melded well together, mellowing it out.  The spice was also good from the chipotles - a good-tasting smokey rich heat. I didn't have any beef broth so I left that out.  I used some corn starch mixed with some of the coffee to thicken, and I also like corn in my chili so I added drained canned corn which also gave the dish extra texture and color. Delcious!

Finally a chili recipe that is absolutely PERFECT! I've been using this recipe for over 2 years. My family, friends, and parents AND children of our soccer club get-togethers always ask me to bring this chili when we converge. I enjoy cooking and baking immensely, but I can't think of another recipe that I gave out more often than this one! Mega kudos :)

Great chili!  I am not sure if I'll be making again because it didn't taste like a traditional chili recipe, which is what my entire family loves.  I followed the recipe exactly, but felt it was a bit on the sweet side and we all could taste the beer, which just didn't work.

Outstanding chili, I get rave reviews everytime I make it.  I have changed things slightly but not much from the origianl recipe.  I have a hispanic friend who says it reminds him of mole (I've never had mole before so I will have to take his word for it).

The combination of the beer and coffee with the sugar in the broth of this chili is phenomenal.  The cumin and chili powder, along with all the other spices give it a rich, full-bodied flavour that will knock your socks off.  This here, is the makings of the best chili on earth.  

My customizations, and the reason I don't give it 4 stars is that it habitually turns out quite wet, so I add an extra can of tomato paste and just leave out the beef broth.  I also tend to add some veggies to lighten up the very heavy chili and bean concentration.  A zuchini, a carrot, a can of corn, an extra onion, nothing exotic.  It just makes it a little healthier and a little lighter.  Also, I have been told by my very carnivorous DH that it's better with the veggies.

I have made this recipe about 6 times now. Original the first time, with a few changes along the way. Instead of beef sirloin, I use ground pork. Substitute ground cumin, a little more than a tablespoon. Nix the cocoa powder, add a dash of cinnamon, alternate beans - 2 cans red kidney beans, 2 cans black beans, and instead of hot chile peppers, I use a spattering of sweet peppers, and either some jalepe√±o's or a habanero. My husband thinks this is the best thing I make, and he regularly comes home from work with the ingredients to make it, and invites friends over to "try my wife's chili." So you know it's good.

This has become my base chili recipe.  Obviously, I change a thing here and there...it's chili after all!   However, this recipe gives the most flavorful chili i've ever tasted.  The beer/coffee addition is awesome!

I have my own chili recipe but wanted to try something different. This recipe is awesome. This is not only my opinion but also from family and friends. I did cut the brown sugar in half and gave it more of a kick by using Rotel tomatoes in a can with chilis. I also let it sit over night in the fridge.

I am making this again because the first time it was ruined from all the sugar. Update: I made it again and it was not good.  It had a tinny taste and the spices were not enough to cover that up.  I guess my search for chili continues . . .

I've been working with this recipe for about a year, trying to perfect it to my tastes and work out a few minor bugs.  I've made at least 10 batches in 10 months, adjusting each time -- and now it is perfect.  Basically, read the reviews and adjust logically.  I made a zillion tweaks -- two of them were to slash the sugar and the tomato paste drastically.  Make your own, as needed.  I ain't telling the rest, because it's now winning me rave reviews everywhere and, basically, I'm competitive. :)

The ingredients seem a litte odd for chili as I've known it, but like others I tried it without changing the recipe much (I omitted the chili peppers).  I have to say this was the best chili I've ever eaten and my wife said the same.  It's down right addicting! Anyone reading this should throw away any other chili recipes because this is the only one you'll need.  If it's better then next day like others have said, then I can't wait for tomorrow!!!

Out of this world!  This is absolutely the best chili I have ever tasted!  I served this at a sledding party -- for both kids and adults-- and everyone raved.  There wasn't a speck left over.  I used really rich,dark,flavorful Quebec beer and was afraid it might be too strong, but it was great.  I substituted pork and beans in tomato sauce for half the kidney beans, and that was good, too.  I will definitely add this to my list of "all time favorites"!

I've been using this recipe for over a year now. Normally I find recipes and need to tweak them. Not in this case! I'd say it's perfect. Recently I've started preparing it all the night before, and cooking in the crockpot on "Low" for about 5 hours. I had to do this because my work schedule and such changed, so I have less time in the evening. Cooking it in the Crock was wonderful!

My son said I made the world's best chili after I made this.  I made it for a church potluck and the whole pot got devoured.  I sometimes double the recipe and freeze leftovers.  Last time I made this my husband helped and sauteed the onions and garlic first in some leftover bacon grease, which is not all that healthy for you but gave it a great flavor.

I have made this chili several times to rave reviews from friends. I usually leave out the cubed beef and go with ground turkey instead to try for a healthier take. I've added chopped corn (you can throw the frozen corn right in just do it early so it'll cook), various types of beans, bell peppers- it's always delicious. This is a sweet chili with a hot kick to it. It's definitely unique- and it reminds me of college since it had my 4 food groups from college: sugar, chocolate, coffee and beer!

I loved this chili and so did my family.  I would cut the sugar in half next time.  I also used ground beef instead of sirloin.  I didnt use the beer because it was too sweet already.  I did 1/2 cup coffee, and i cut back on the peppers.  Yum yum though!

This is the best chili ever. Cook it every superbowl and it's gone with 20mins. Huge hit!  I agree with only using half the sugar.

This is by far the best chili I've ever had.  I've made this recipe at least a dozen times over the past 2 years and received nothing short of rave reviews.  I think it is fabulous as written although often make a few adjustments depending on availability of ingredients.  It is a very "forgiving" chili this way and always turns out delicious despite my alterations and "eye ball" measurements.  I usually use 1 3/4 lbs lean ground sirloin rather than the sirloin/ground beef mix, omit the veg oil, substitute 1/2T cumin powder for the 1T cumin seeds, omit the salt, and substitute 1-2 fresh jalepenos for the hot chile peppers.  Sometimes I use less sugar, but not always--depending on how I'm feeling.  And sometimes I use 1/2 kidney beans and 1/2 pinto beans--all added at the same time for sake of simplicity. I use my husband's dark stout homebrew and coffee left over in the pot from morning.  Bob you're a genious, thank you!

OK-I did it. Let me tell you. Sounds crazy, but AMAZING. Flavor amazing. I made it the night before, but it tasted pretty good that night! I used Bud light and some hungarian hot pepper which was all they had at my food store I also used red kidney beans and cannoli beans and ground sirloin. FOLLOW THIS RECIPE WITH THE coffee and beer and brown sugar and you will really love it. My inlaws and outlaws are not chili people but I made it and they all loved it. THE BEST CHILI EVER!!

This was an excellent chili!  Delicious and better the next day.  I advise to make ahead & let the flavors really come out. I used green chili peppers 5 rather than 8 (I doubled the recipe).  It had just the right amount of heat for us. I like a sweet chili with some kick but not enough that you are sweating. This was perfect. The sirloin made a richer heartier chili.  I didn't have a dark beer so threw in some regular Budweiser. Will make again.
Additional info as of 4/18/07 - Okay, have made this again... Even my 2 yr old can't get enough of it! You have got to make this chili.  I do not add the cayene pepper until the end and add little by little until I get the heat that I am looking for.  I am going to make this for a chili cookoff in the fall.

YUM!  I loved this chili!  I did lower the brown sugar to just a tablespoon because my dad doesn't like sweet chili.  I would have liked it sweet too though.  I also used just hamburger meat because of preference.  I tasted it while it was cooking and increased the chili powder to 5 T and the cumin to 2 T.  I like it to have a little bite.  But overall this was a great recipe, you can just tweak it slightly for your tastes.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for a chili party and nobody liked it!  I thought I couldn't go wrong with 600+ excellent ratings, but I was wrong!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was too sweet and too spicy (I love spice!).  I used serrano peppers and I would recommend jalapenos to anyone who dares try this recipe.  Most of my guests said that it lacked something, but we couldn't figure out what it was.  Ironically, it was sweet and spicy, but lacked flavor!  I would not recommend this recipe... Sorry, Bob!  But, you have plenty of other fans!

This is the chili recipe that got me started. I was looking for a fun, complex, spicy chili like the ones I had in the midwest, and decided to try this. It's amazing, and what's best about it, is that it gives you a great base to experiment with and create your own, unique bowl of chili. The modifications I make are: No cocoa, half the amount of sugar, and the amount / type of chilis I use depends on who I'm making it for. For a mixed crowd with people who may not like overly spicy dishes, two completely seeded jalapenos will be just enough to give it the bite. If you like it nice and HOT, use 2 habaneros. Another great way is 1 habanero, 1 jalapeno and a teaspoon of Thai red chili sauce. Also, it is very important you use a good beer. I used to used cheap stuff at first and it's a waste. A nice dark, creamy European beer is the way to go.

Really, Really good. I didn't have the 1 1/2 hr simmer time to wait so I browned the meat and onion and put everything else in the crock pot for around 12 hrs on low. It turned out GREAT. From now on this is the only Chili receipe I will use.

Good, interesting tasting chili!  With conflicting reviews on the amount of sugar, I tried to add the sugar to taste but with all the spices, etc. it was hard to tell when it was enough.  I ended up putting in just umder the 1/2 cup it called for.  The result was definitely sweet.  Even with the super strong coffee and beer I put in.  Next time, 1/4 cup will be enough for me.  I suggest others do the same and add more if they'd like at the end.  I liked the chunks of cubed sirloin along with the ground beef -- nice touch.  I do have a craving for a more tomato-y chili with the traditional taste so this won't be my regular chili although now that I've bought all the different spices, I will be making this again and again!

Fantastic !! I made it for a Fiesta theme     party and it was a big hit . It's so easy to make as everything goes into one pot! The only thing I changed was instead of fresh chilies, I bought the diced tomatoes with chilies . I've made it 3 times since Sept.Thanks

I made this chili and was shocked at how great it was.  There are so many flavors that attack your tongue.  It's amazing!!!!
It wasn't spicy enough for me so I did add extra chili pepper and cayenne pepper.  Otherwise the best chili I've ever had!!

Best chili I've ever had...  My guests agree wholeheartedly.  I was a little leary of the ingredients, and it smelled very strongly of beer at the beginning of the cooking stage, but the end result was out of this world.  I used 2 cans kidney beans and 2 cans black beans for variety.  YUM, YUM!

A bit intimidating, but in the end, a true confidence builder for the chili first timer!  

I've eaten my fair share of chili (i'm from Ohio, most of it influenced by the Cincinnati variety) but have never made it.  I spent a winter Sunday morning putting this puppy together, hauled it over to a late Christmas celebration, and three people at nearly the entire batch.

For whatever reason, I decided to make a couple of modifications.  I skipped the cubed sirloin and just bumped the ground (chuck) a little, doubled the garlic (i convinced myself they were small cloves), exchanged both tomato products with a large (29oz) can of tomato sauce (i don't like bits of tomato), halved the bean count, and for peppers, i used one anaheim, two jalepenos and one _fourth_ of a habanero.  

After reading all of the reviews, I was curious about the brown sugar.  I asked my mom about it and she said "you're making chili, not sloppy joes!", so i skipped it...but in the end, added about a teaspoon and a half of molasses just for the mental image of it pouring in.

As far as process goes, i think the one big winner was a recommendation from my step-dad.  In step 2, i switched the sauces and the spices.  After the meat, garlic and onions were browned and ready to go, i (forgot to drain them and) poured the spices in.  I kept the heat low and just let the whole heavenly combo get to know each other while cleand and chopped (or in the case of the habanero, chippity-chop-chopped) the peppers

I rated this recipe back in 2000. This is still our favorite Chili recipe.
My review is as follows: 

This Recipe was FABULOUS. 

I cut back a bit on the spices:
1 Tablespoon of Chili powerder, 
1/2 teaspoon of the 1 teaspoon spices
And only 1 peppper.....because I could
tell from the ingredients that it would
be two hot for my taste and stomach.

I also cut the kidney beans in half and
added some a cup of corn.

I have for a long time, been looking for 
a good chili recipe. This is definately a
keeper!

Best chili I've ever had. I'm not sure that it matters (although some reviewers seem to think so) but I'm in TX and my husband was born and raised here. We were both blown away by this chili. Neither of us thought it was too sweet or too hot or too anything. The ingredients came together in perfect harmony and it was just right. Not a drop was wasted and I'm happy to report that it freezes very well. 

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it as written. At the end of the cook time, it tasted fantastic but was a little thinner than I prefer so I drained and rinsed a can of black beans, pulsed them in the food processor to mash them up, and then mixed them into the chili. It thickened right up and went from a 4.5 to 5 stars. 

Second time I made a couple changes. Drained and rinsed kidney beans and only used 2 cans. Doubled tomatoes and drained them. Chili had a much better consistency but still wasn't quite thick enough so I stirred in a can of mashed black beans again and voila. I'll do it this way every time now. Oh, I couldn't find my whole cumin seeds anywhere the second time so I subbed 1/2 T ground cumin. Still delish. I'll use whole cumin in the future but just mentioning in case anyone is wondering if it can be subbed and by how much.

Both times making this chili I used Shiner Bohemian Black Lager and Anaheim Peppers. The first time I used Starbucks Pike Place Coffee and the second time I used Starbucks Mocha Coffee.

The depth of flavor in this chili is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly this first time. I was suprised it was so soupy though. My family did not like that it was soupy but did like the taste. I did use the crock pot and cooked on high for 5 hours and did brown and drain the meat. So much better than packaged chili mix. Will make it again. Upate..I made this again and cut out liquid by draining and rinsing beans and lowering amounts of all other liquids. Can out much better the 2nd time!

2017 - This is our go to Chili recipe now!  We love it!  I have given it out to many others who also love it! I always get mega kudos when I make it for parties.

I've made this recipe many times since I first tried it in November 2000. The version I printed out then is the same minus the brown sugar. It works as a vegetarian chili as well, using Match Meats ground beef.

This was really good and also froze well. The only thing I will change next time is to only add a half bottle of beer. I used a dark stout, which added great flavor, but overpowered. That's saying something coming from a beer lover! If you use a lighter beer it might be okay to use the whole thing.

I followed the recipe as closely as I could, only making changes to fit our family's liking.  Used 2 1/2 pounds ground beef instead of the sirloin & 2 cans diced tomatoes (b/c it didn't look like it was enough)...oh & I didn't see hot chili peppers at the store, so I used one jalapeno instead.    Came out fabulous! I made it in the crock pot for ease of transportation & it turned out great.  Compliments all around.  Served it with sour cream & cheese on top ...YUM!!

We made this chili for about 2 years with no alterations and always loved it, especially when topped with sour cream and cheese. Recently our modifications have been small. We've reduced the number of chili peppers to 2 (usually choosing jalapenos) and we've added 1/2 cup of orange juice for a little more pizzazz. We've never thought it too sweet. You taste the sugar on the attack, then the savory, and lastly the heat.

This chili was very good, but the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I like my chili thick, and this one was a little thinner than I would prefer.  Next time, I will not put any sugar in it and cut down on the water.  Great overall though.

I have never made chili and haven't had it in probably 15 years so I waited to review it until I got real chili eaters to taste it.  RAVE REVIEWS.  I almost made it in the slow cooker and I'm glad I didn't because of the amount of liquid.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/8 c. based on other reviews and cut to two peppers but will use 4 next time.  Only used 2 cans of beans in the hopes that my bean-hating husband would try it (no such luck).  I cooked it longer than suggested just to make it a little thicker.  If I'm being honest, I ate it for dinner, breakfast (yes, breakfast) and dinner again.  Already sharing the recipe.  Thank you!!!

Great recipe!  Made it last Christmas for adult children and they all loved it. Recently won 3rd place in a chili competition at work (out of 21 different entries) using oatmeal stout, a combination of fresh jalapeno peppers and canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (use only 1 canned chipotle pepper for every 2 chili peppers in recipe--you can freeze remaining canned chipotle peppers in ice cube trays and pop into a ziplock bag when frozen for other uses), and a mixture of kidney and black beans.  I also halve the brown sugar.  I always make this the day before serving--flavors are definitely better!  Serve with Fritos, sour cream (helps take the heat out of the chili), fresh tomatoes, green onions, and cheese for people to "build" their own bowl.

I can see why some people like this mix, but I don't consider it to be chili.  It tastes more like barbequed beef with a sweet barbeque sauce.  Made this an another chili for a party, and people who arrived late got to eat this because the other one was gone.  Only my one brother liked it because he was starving, and his wife doesn't cook for him often.

I think this might be more of a Cincinatti chili, rather than a Texas Chili.

I have given VERY few recipes 5 stars...in my life, this one deserves it!!!!  Good job Bob! Like others, I used all ground beef. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, and 2 tablespoons ancho chili powder (instead of regular chili powder--ancho is milder and more dimensional). I used all kidney beans and drained them very well. Lastly, in lieu of fresh chile peppers I used only 2 canned chipotle peppers (in adobo sauce)--I love the smokey flavor they contribute. You will NOT be disappointed with this recipe. Note: serve with sour cream, grated cheddar, chopped fresh cilantro and sliced green onions, or chives.

Absolutey wonderful recipe.  I consider myself somewhat of a chili snob or aficionado--that sounds so much better than snob-- Anyway I tweaked this wonderful dish only slightly to suit my tastes. I added one can of refried beans for 30 minutes to thicken slightly and I also added some XXX hot sauce (2 TBS.) and floated 2 Habaneros or Scotch Bonnetts for the full 2 hours. Cut brown sugar to a third. This gets better with age.  Its now 9:35 AM and I'm finishing up yet another bowl.  Thanks Bob

This recipe is super....nice and thick!  I can't eat fresh onions or fresh chili peppers so I added some corn, regular green pepper, dehydrated
onion and a few sundried chili peppers.  I also decreased the kidney beans to 2 1/2 cans because the meat should be the main focus.  I threw away all my other chili recipes and it was a hit among the people I shared it with.  Cornbread and real butter are wonderful with it.  Thanks!

You may look askance at some of the ingredients, but I assure you, they all come together into a wonderful whole.  This is a great and flavourful chili for those who realize that pain is not a flavour.  It has a nice kick (and guests can always add more spice), but isn't overwhelmingly hot.

This is a great recipe but decided to change it just a bit because I like to experiment.  I used chipolte peppers. I also added celery and regular peppers.

Amazing! My husband loved this. I made a few tweaks. I did not add the hot chili peppers. I changed the beans up a bit, and I added bacon. I've been searching for the perfect chili recipe for a long time. Now, I've found it!

Very bold, very hearty flavors.  Rich but not too much.  I did cut back on the chili powder and cayenne a little only because we do not like a ton of spice, and its still got enough of a bite for us. Its just half way into its simmer and I love what I've "taste tested" so far.  Will absolutely be saving this one to the recipe box.

This is phenomenal!  I've been looking for a new chili recipe that didn't have a thousand ingredients and I decided to try this.  The coffee/beer/cocoa really intrigued me.  Who knew you could put those things together and have it turn out wonderful?!  I cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup because of the comments of it being too sweet.  It does have a sweetness to it, but (to me) it was not too much.  This will be my football chili from now on!  Thank you!

Very nicely done. Great blend of spices and has that 'chunky' texture with the cubed sirloin that makes each bite just radiate those spices on your palate. Leave out the beans and you've got some Real Honest to Goodness chili here.

I make this chilli at least once a month.  I just cut down on the chilli powder to make it less potent for the 'weak of heart'.  Love the idea of beer and coffee!  That's what sold me!

This is by far the best chili I've ever had.  The flavor is so complex and yummy!  The only change I made was reduce the brown sugar, per other reviews.  I used between 2 TBSP and 1/4 cup.  I used a Kona blend coffee and a brown ale and this came out great.  A definite keeper, thank you!

This is a great recipie!  Thanks for the ideas!  Chili is just that...an all American great dinner that no-where else in world do they "get it".  The merging of beans and meat with different spices will crack even the most difficult of smiles.  I followed to the T.  Great, yummie and awesome!  You decide where to go from there...kick up the heat or sweaten up the pot!

Great stuff! Made this chili for Halloween and it was a big hit. Doubled a batch a day ahead of time and reheated in a crock pot. Since I was cooking for kids and old people I skipped the cayenne and didn't double the hot peppers, used the original 4 jalapenos. Complex flavors but not spicy.

This chili is really good.  The one caveat is that I tasted it when it was done & the flavor seemed to be a bit flat.  However, we let it mellow for 24 hours before eating it, and the chili has a rich flavor, combining sweet and hot, and it is wonderfully thick.  Do be patient and let the chili sit overnight.  It is not significantly hot, even using four jalape√±os.  The combination of ground and cubed beef makes for nice texture.  I may still try other chili recipes, but my husband and I agree that this one is a keeper.  The ingredient list was intriguing, and the finished product was worth the time & effort I put into it.  Thanks for a great recipe

Hands down best chili recipe I have ever made. We just had a chili feed and invited about 100 people over, I made several batches and no one went hungry and everyone loved it. I am now passing the recipe on to others. MODIFICATIONS - I forgot the peppers, cut the sugar down by half, used only ground beef and used Coors Light beer cuz it's one we had on hand. I started the chili on Thursday night to marinate everything, cooked it all together on Friday, reheated everything Saturday and served it that night. It was not too sweet, and by letting it sit for a few days only enhanced the flavor. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

I cut the cayenne and fresh chile amounts in half (I used jalapenos) because I am a whimp.  Also cut the sugar in half because I do not like too much sweet.  The result was mild and perfect for me.  Kids thought it was too spicy.  Husband thought it wasn't spicy enough.  Spice aside, the flavor was awesome and I will certainly make this again.

Update: I've made this recipe three times in the last couple months. I accidentally made the best batch of chili, ever, when I used a sweet chocolate stout. When I taste-tested the chili, I thought it would come out too sweet, so I added a bit of dark chocolate balsamic vinegar. I let it cook in the crock pot all night, then let it sit in the fridge all day. Oh. My. God. The BEST chili I've ever had. Spicy, slightly sweet, an a bit of tang. Seriously addictive!

I wish I could give this 10 stars! This is awesome and people are always surprised to hear the ingredients. It is a really great idea to use real steak in the chili too. I fix this up, spoon into my big crock pot dish, let it chill in the fridge overnight and serve at an annual fall chili get-together the next day - perfect for allowing me to enjoy myself at the party instead of slaving away in the kitchen all day!

This chili recipe is awesome.  I did make a couple changes because I was worried that it would be too spicey for my 5 and 3 year old.  I put in 2 T chili powder and 2 jalapenos, instead of the 3 1/2 T and 4 chili peppers.  I think I could have put in the rest of the chili powder and it still would have been mild enough for my girls.  Oh, I did add a green pepper since it was in my fridge too.  It was delicious... even my 5 year old tore it up.  We just added a little cheddar and couple crackers and oh my goodness... amazing.  It's sweet, and then it kicks you in the butt... just a little.  : )  MAKE IT!

We have dubbed this "OUR" chili.  We have made this for years and love, love, love this chili.  We cut down on the beans by a can and add more beef but other than that we make it exactly the same.  Oh, and we add a Guiness beer for more bold beer flavor.  You will enjoy this chili.

This is the best chili in the world!! I don't even know how many times I have made this! I always give the credit to Bob. At first I was worried about the beer & coffee, but they blend SO well with the other ingredients! For this recipe, some of my friends have joined the All-Recipes family!

Like others have said, the recipe in the orginal form left something to be desired.  I put it in the crockpot overnight and then put it in the fridge all day to let the flavors develop.  After heating it up I added an extra tsp. of garlic salt, about a 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin, a tablespoon oregano and 2 tbsp cocoa.  I left out the sugar altogether and the cayenne because I don't like really spicy food, also added an extra can of tomato paste oh, and a pound of sausage at the beginning. I think next time I would use more sirloin. And I used chili beans instead of kidney.  NOW I have a winner!  Going to a chili cookoff tonight-wish me luck!

I'd give this a 10 star rating if I could.  I've made this for a couple of years, and I LOVE it!  I don't care for the beef cubes in this recipe, though.  I have made it with them in the past, but I think I will omit them when I make it this weekend for Superbowl XL.  My only complaint is that it does not fit my crockpot, so I have to make it over my stove, making it harder to transport when taking this super awesome chili to other's houses.  And yes, you do need all those crazy ingredients to make this recipe work.  We are NOT beer drinkers, and we buy beer just for this recipe, once a year.
Oh, and if the chili is a bit to strong for your palatte, add some rice and a dollop of sour cream to mellow it a bit, but still enjoy the flavors!

I omitted the beer just because I did not have time to go to the store, and instead of the chili peppers I added a small jar of salsa.  I used powerded cumin instead of the cumin seeds and I like to add a little more chili powder/cumin and cayenne than suggested.  The amount of beans was overwhelming so next time I will cut back a can. This was one of the best chilis I have ever had.

Oh My Goodness!!!  This is the best Chili ever.  My three year old son had so much fun helping me make this Chili.  And he had so much fun eating it too!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used cumin powder instead of the seeds.  Thick and flovorful.  Absolutely yummy.  Thanks!

This is just the BEST chili recipe ever.  I have substituted skinless boneless chicken breast for the sirloin, I've omited the beef broth or the tomato paste when I didn't have them on hand, I've substituted tomato sauce or tomato puree for the broth.  It comes out great every time. It's very user and pantry friendly :)  

The only real changes I made were to scale the recipe down to 4 servings (although it's even better left over) decrease the chili peppers and to add diced green pepper, parsley, garlic and basil. I also put all the beans in at once and simmer for about 2 hours, adding a little water if it gets too thick while simmering.  It has alot of unusual ingredients (coffee, cocoa etc) which is what made me want to try it. Surprisingly they all work together well. Serve this with some warm garlic bread and a crisp salad and you have a delicious and easy meal.  My DH who doesn't like Chili said this is the best!

I've made this using the original recipe and since then with modifications.  As is, I give it a 3 , but with modifications it's a 5 so I gave it an average of 4.  All that tomato paste and brown sugar makes for one very sweet chili.  I lessened the tomato paste to 1 can, and only used about 1-2 tbsp brown sugar and after that the results were fantastic.  Yum!

Wow!  This is the first review I've written, and there's a reason for it!  While I was making this chili, I would taste it periodically and hated it.  I used Guiness like recommended and had used jalepeno peppers instead of chili peppers. I was starting to think I had something wrong with my taste buds considering all the positive reviews.  After it was done, I added shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream...a must do...because that made this chili without a doubt the best I've ever had.  I eliminated one can of beans, and I do think that was plenty.  But the ground beef and sirloin really make this a chunky soup.  yummy!

The most awesome chili I have ever eaten, let alone made!  I did adjust the seasonings a bit to fit my family's taste.  I found the longer you simmer it, the thicker it gets, so don't worry about how thin it looks initially.  Fabulously complex blend of flavors.  I'll never make chili from an envelope again!  Thanks, Bob, and reviewers who offered comments and modifications!  I'll be making this a lot this winter!

Well, the first day I made it I thought it tasted "ok" but the day after, OUTTA THIS WORLD!. I used only sirloin, and jalapenos instead of chile peppers, substituted black beans for half of the beans. We used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. If you are going to try this, please give yourself a day for the flavors to meld, it really tastes much better the day after it is made. We used Shiner Bach beer - superb!

Where on earth did I go wrong? I followed this recipe to the tee. It smells great and I made it the day before and couldn't wait to eat it.... My husband thought it was too sweet. And I don't want to be harsh but I got a migraine from something in there. I really wish this would have been as great as I had hoped... but I'd rather not make it again then take the chance to give the ceramic bowl that much close attention.... Thanks anyways Bob...

After reading all the reviews I was very excited to try out this recipe. I was so unhappy with the results. We all love to eat chili, but I couldn't even stomach it after the second bite. You could taste everything from the coffee to the beer to the suger and they really dont mix well!

I too was skeptical about the ingredients of this chili, however was pleasantly surprised on how wonderful it tasted.  The only thing I will change for next time is cut back on the brown sugar.  Thanks for sharing Bob!

I followed all of the directions exactly and it didn't turn out the way I thought it would be.  The flavor is too bizarre, hot and tangy at the same time.  My family said it was too spicy and they didn't quite like the flavor such as beer (Wicked Ale) and coffee in it.  I'm sure this recipe is popular with other people but this isn't what I was looking for.  I would definitely NOT make this again.

Onto my search for the perfect chili!

9/15/2004 - I'm surprised people still rate this so high.

Thought this chili was delicious! A nice change from a package of chili seasoning. I used ground venison instead of the cube sirloin. Next time I will use less sugar as we found it to be a little too sweet.

Oh my, is this ever good!!! I cut the coffee and brown sugar in half, left out the beer, added fresh cilantro and black beans instead of kidney beans. Yummy. It was a little firey for my mild tongued family, but I loved it and so did my guests. I'm making it again and will tone the spices down a bit for the sake of my husband, but I know he'll love it!!! Try it out even though some of the ingredients sound a little strange. You won't be sorry.

This was very good.  We don't like beans so I added an extra pound of ground beef.  I also didn't have any coriander..didn't miss it.  I also threw the tomatoes in the blender so there would be no chunks..Everyone loved it.

I was pretty scared to try this, it does sound awful.  Don't be intimidated by the ingredients, it was delicious!

I used Sam Adams because I didn't have any Guinness.  I cut the brown sugar in half like others suggested.  YUM!

Kids don't like it?  All 6 of our kids ate it and asked for more!

Everyone in my house had different feelings about it. I all the different flavors in it somehow dulled each other out. My boyfriend liked it, except he could tatse the chocolate and didn't like that. Our roommate thought it was to spicy. We all thought it was to sweet. All and all it was okay. My biggest mistake was using my favorite beer "Arcadia Starboard Stout", it's an oatmeal stout and you could definetly taste it.

I am kind of a self proclaimed chili aficionado.  This is without a doubt the best chili I have ever tasted.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  It is a little spicy but that can be altered to individual tastes.  I give this recipe a huge thumbs up!

Some of the best chili I have ever eaten.  Not particularly difficult to make.  Some odd ingredients which I think make it special without creating a peculiar flavor.  Give it a shot.  I used French Vanila coffee to accentuate the cocoa.  Worked well!

Very good chili.  I added a touch of sweet, though, by adding about a cup of apple cider and a fourth of a cup of brown sugar.

Great chunky and spicy chili.  It is great served over rice with sharp cheddar cheese on the top.  Great on those cold winter nights.

Have made this chili several times, as said before by many others make it according the the directions before you decide to tweak it. I like adding a little more spice because I like my chili hot but this is by far my all time favorite.

Recipe is great. I prefer a little less sweet and a little more smoke. Next time I will cook this recipe (and there will definitely be a next time) with half the amount of brown sugar and I will add a can of chipotle peppers with the sauce. This should add some smoke and cut back on how sweet it is.

As another reviewer stated, I would make this as is and then change it for your tastes. As written, it is a "Bean chili with meat" recipe. That means that every bite will be full of beans with some slight meat pieces. If you want "Meat chili with beans", meaning each bite will have meat and a few beans, I would reduce the beans from 4 cans to 3 and increase the sirloin to 1 1/4 pounds if you like a beef stew texture or increase the ground meat to 1 1/2 pounds if you like a ground beef texture. AS FAR AS THE SUGAR goes, use 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup and taste it when the chili is done. If you still think it needs sugar just stir it in. BAM sugar problem solved. Now you don't have to worry if you should use less sugar. Also, the recipe does not state to wash the beans or not. I dumped all four cans with juice in and it was fine. If you like thick chili (like spoon it on a cracker) then I would throw the juice out before I put the beans in or cook longer without a lid on. The next time I am going to add some corn so that it has a crunch to it.

I won 2nd place in a chili cook off with this recipe.  My fiance can't stop talking about how good it was, and I've promised to make it again.  I didn't have a problem with it being too sweet, as some reviewers suggested, but I did make it the day before I served it.  Only change I made was to use two cans pinto beans and two cans kidney, instead of four cans kidney.  The only reason I did that is just because I really like pinto beans :)

Very good. I made it the day ahead, as suggested by other reviews. I also cut the sugar in half and it was plenty sweet for me. I used Guiness beer which I think was too strong. I also used just three cans of beans though four would be o.k but I liked three. Very good. A keeper.

Absolutely fabulous. I've cooked this recipe twice; the first time I thought it was a little too sweet, so I cut back on the brown sugar. The second time, it was even better! Both times, the leftovers were even better! I had friends calling and asking when the next time I was cooking chili. This dish and sweet cornbread, is the bomb!

The best chili ever! If you don't have all the spices it can be a bit expensive to get but it's worth it! This chili has so much flavor and with the sirloin added in, it makes it even more rich. I think it's the more unusual ingredients that give it it's bold flavors like the coffee, cocoa powder, and of course the beer. It's the perfect mix between spicy and sweet. It'll be a winner in your house! Just try it because you won't be disappointed.

Excellent recipe!  Like others said, it was a little sweet the first day, but the second day it was amazing!  When I make it again I will use 2 cans of Kidney beans, 2 cans of Pinto beans, and one can of black beans instead of all Kidney beans.

Very,Very Good! I usually do not alter recipes, and the only reason I did with this is, several of the items I did not have on hand! I substituted the cubed sirloin for 1 pound of hot Italian sausage, and omited the beer. The Guys Devoured it!! will definately make this again. from now on, this is my "go to" Chili Recipe!

I really like this one.  Reduced sugar by half and didn't add any fresh peppers because the people I was entertaining a mixed crowd and not everyone can eat spicey.  I will make it again and add habanero peppers for a slow burn.  Great recipe ROBTX99.

I love chili and this recipe is amazing. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I didn't feel like making any and it still came out fabulous. I did add an extra pepper...with the seeds and also I cut the beef broth in half and added an equal part of spicy V8.

I won my office chili cookoff with this recipe!  Fantastic.  Followed the directions exactly as stated EXCEPT I used a dark Bavarian beer and 2 shots of Espresso.  Other than that everything was exactly the same.  And yes, it is better the next day.  Although I did find myself eating it as it was cooking.  Amazing flavor!

I tried this recipe recently and really enjoyed it. However, I did omit the hot chili peppers and cubed sirloin (added 1/2 lb more ground beef). I used Young's Double Chocolate Stout for the beer. This was great over pasta. I think this made a lot more than 8 servings, because we were eating it for several days.

One of the best chili recipes I have tried!!! I love the diversity of this recipe, with a few alterations, you can change the taste drastically. I am a avid coffee drinker, but opted out of the straight coffee and instead combined it with the beer by using Red Hook's DB Stout (this is a double esspresso Stout). Also slow cooked this over night in a crockpot, by doing so I included the full amount of brown sugar and added 1/4cup of sugar in the raw. Since this was slow cooked over 12hrs then cooled and stored 12hrs, and re-heated I was able to add 3 habaneros, and 6 jalapenos with just the right eatable heat. Also draining and mixing up the bean type worked great!

Made this many times. Always excellent. Though, from memory, I drain two of the cans of beans. Add the beans with liquid first. Then, nearer to the end, add the beans without liquid. Use my espresso machine for the coffee. Increase the amount of cubed sirloin. Really, really, tasty. I'm Australian, and have thrown down the gauntlet to my Texan buddy for a chili cooking competition. I'm gonna knock his socks off with this.

I received some wonderful warm "fuzzies" for this dish last night! Made the recipe almost to the letter and it was great. It had a fantastic and wonderful "mole sauce" flavor that is so different from everyday chili. Only changes, I used extra hamburger, sirloin and pinto beans (that's what I had). At the end I added an extra teaspoon of salt and an extra teaspoon of chili powder. Topped with Tillimook sharp cheddar and chopped Walla Walla sweat onion. I had started this in the morning and then cooled it down in a water bath so I could put it in the fridge. I wanted to let it cool to see if I could get the flavors to blend a bit more, you know how things always taste better the next day. Any way after 4 hours in the cold box I heated it up and eight of us enjoyed a wonderful dinner with some great cornbread (Honey Cornbread) from this site! Like others have said, "Don't change it before you've tried it" and DO make it the day before if possible!

This was the best chili I have ever had! It is the first chili I have made on my own and I am not sure I will want to try another now! The spices work so great together! It sounds like a lot of work because of all the ingredients but it's really not! And it is well worth it! I left out the chili peppers mainly because I didn't find them at the store but I think it was perfect. It was slightly spicy and sweet at the same time. GREAT RECIPE!!

i have made this chili for so many occasions, and dinner parties. it is wonderful, and gets nice and thick. the only thing i usually alter:   i/o Kidney Beans, i use Black Beans & add one box of frozen corn, and use chicken i/o beef.   it's perfect and hearty!

Won 2 church chili cook-offs with this recipe! It is best eaten the next day! Don't change the brown sugar... or any amounts of ingredients... Be sure to wear gloves when cutting the peppers... Yummy stuff!

Great chili as is! I make this all the time, but we are spice lightweights so I reduce the chilis to 1 and the cayenne altogether.  I also replace a pound of the meat with 2 extra jars of beans.

I really liked this recipe for chili.  I added some tabasco for a kick as well as some hot cherry peppers to spice it up more.  Will make again.

I was really excited to make this chili with beer however the taste of the beer was still too strong no matter how long I cooked it.  I added some gravy master and some more beef broth.  It is still good but not perfect.

This chili is spectacular. I followed the recipe exactly except in a few instances. 1. I browned the ground beef and sirloin in a separate pan so I could drain the grease. 2. I halved the amount of brown sugar. 3. I used a can of peeled, diced tomatoes with jalapenos and Anaheim chiles instead of hot peppers. Chickening out on the peppers is my only regret. My chili didn't have the heat I wanted. Next time I'll use hot peppers. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

Loved this recipe. Will make from now on as it got great reviews from the family.  Changed a couple things to match what I had on hand.  Used 2 lbs ground beef, black beans, added one can of corn, drained, and used ground cumin instead of seeds. Everything else was followed.  Don't let the "soupiness" in the beginning upset you.  Give it plenty of time to cook down on low heat.  S00000 good.

Not that this needs another review, but it was delicious! The only change i made was instead of the cocoa and the sugar, I just grated and tossed in some semi-sweet chocolate i had in the fridge. Way to go!!!

I made a few changes/additions to this chili and won a chili contest on SuperBowl Sunday with it.  Making chili was never my thing, and this was the first time that I had ever made chili for others to eat.  Great recipe!

This is the best chili I have ever made...and maybe ever tasted.  I would not use kidney beans though..something smaller.  Black beans maybe?  I get so many compliments.  And definitely leave out the sugar...too sweet for my taste.

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews it has received. I followed the recipe to a T. I did not care for it at all. Too sweet and too much beer.  I'll stick to my traditional chili recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly aside from two minor changes. 1) I used half of the recommended amount of brown sugar. A quarter of a cup seemed too sweet, and if I needed to I could add the remaining two tablespoons later. 2) Regretfully, I had to leave out the ground coriander as I will not pay $5 for a teensy jar of ground coriander.

This is the best chili I have ever had. The coffee and the cocoa disappear into the background, leaving just a dark and slightly bitter hint floating through the chili. The beer added a rich and robust flavor that paired very well with the beef. There is just the right ratio of liquid to beans and it thickens up just fine on its own as it simmers.

The only changes I will make next time will be to find that ground coriander and add it and to use the beer to de-glaze the bottom of my pot after browning the meat and onions. I think that with all of the coriander added and the de-glazing of the pot this recipe will cement its place as best chili ever.

I like chili. I like to try new chili because I don't know how to think up my own chili. With that said, this was an excellent chili! I personally found it to be just a tad (only a tad) too sweet. I doubled this when I made it, so next time will not double the sugar and I think it will be fine. It had a wonderful, comforting taste on a cold day. I like the sneak-up-on-you spicy that is not overwhelming. Thanks for a great recipe. Maybe now I'll stop cruising around chili recipes. :) naaaah! I like chili!

We all agreed this made some of the very best chili we have ever eaten. I used 2 lbs. ground sirloin, 3 T canned diced jalapeno, only 1 can kidney & 1 can pinto beans, and a Texas-German bock amber beer. This chili had fabulous flavor, a little sweet but the heat from the chiles follows. I add a splash of hot pepper sauce or lime juice at the table or vinegar (my Daddy's secret) at the table to give it tang. I've had this one in my recipe file for over a year now and just finally got around trying it and sure wish we'd tried this one last year! Thanks for posting this, it's a new favorite here.

This is by far the best chili I have ever had or made.  I LOVE how the cocoa and beer really make for a complex, rich flavor.  I also love the two different types of beef.  All around the BEST!

I don't know what I can say about this chili that has not already been said. It is fantastic! Probably like everyone else here, I was quite intrigued yet VERY dubious of the ingredients. Coffee, beer, and cocoa would be the last things I would have ever thought to put in chili but boy did they all work. The chili does not taste like beer or coffee or cocoa though. All the flavors sort of meld together nicely to creat a new unique flavorful chili. Not one of the flavors is overbearing. It's just the right bit of sweetness, just the right bit of savory, and just the right bit of spicy. My husband said it was the best chili he's ever had and my four year-old, who normally isn't a big fan of chili, had four helpings and didn't find it to be too spicy.
This is for sure a keeper!

Seriously this was such a great recipe. Like others I was immediately intrigued with the ingredients and I'm so glad I decided to go ahead and try it. I did make a few alterations so here goes:

2.3 lbs ground beef (instead of gb AND sirloin)
1 12 oz. Michelob Amber Bock beer
2/3 cups brown sugar (and it WASNT too much!)
Only 3 cans of beans: one chili, one light red kidney and one dark red
and for the chilis I used 4 large hot finger peppers and it was just the amount of spicy to taste great and keep your mouth warm

Other than that I followed the exact recipe. It was delicious! Thanks so much for posting it!

Absolutely delicious!  Won 3rd place in my company's chili cook-off (which really means 1st since we usually award our clients)!  Slight changes to suit my tastes, however.  I dont like the texture of beans, so as filler i substituted hominy (mexican corn) instead.  i also omitted the cayenne pepper because i ran out.  the recipe is a little sweet (the way i like it), so to make it more savory, i also added 1 pound of smoked bacon, cooked, but not crisped.  Pair it with sweet cornbread (there is a great recipe on this site that i used with this one) and you have a winner!

Probably the best chili I've ever had. I used 4 jalepeno peppers added an extra 1/2lb each sirloin and ground beef and then followed the recipe as written. Came out perfect. Not too sweet like others have written.

This has to be one of my favourite chilli recipes.  Make sure to cut the meat small, to get a really tender chilli and let it simmer for as long as you can.
I only use 2 cans of beans as I find that is enough.

What a great chili recipe!  The only thing I would change is to cut back on the brown sugar by about half.  It was just a tad too sweet.

I have been wanting (and waiting) to find a good chili recipe to add to my "keeper" file for a long while and this one could be it....  I liked the "sweet" taste, but my bf wasn't crazy about it (probably because he prefers his chili hot - and without beans!!!).  I'll make this again, but only with a few changes.  First, I will use half the amount of brown sugar called for (1/4 cup or maybe even 1/8 cup per other's suggestions), a hotter pepper (jalapenos aren't hot enough for us), maybe more seasoning (?), ground spicy sausage in place of or substituted for half of the beef (I heard sausage is good in chili) OR all cubed beef and only 1/2 to 2 cans of beans.  I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because of all of the modifications that will be needed when I make it again.  This goes particularly well with corn bread or Pillsbury's refrigerated bread sticks. Thanks for sharing!

Oh this was nice! I had fresh ground and brewed short blacks  in this recipe and the chilli powder was home made from a mix of dried tobasco  and cayenne chillis (about 35 in total to get the 3 1/2 tablespoons). the 'chile peppers' i used were red savina habaneros (yes I am insane but I like it hot). The beer i used was guinness. I put a little bit too much sugar in the mix, but it's still a fabulous recipe.

I had read at least 100 of the reviews before I tried the chili, and decided to use a bit less coffee and beer. I also reduced the recipe to 4 portions.I was very impressed! From the very begining the chili had a great taste, although I did let it simmer 4 hours and next time I would add the full amount from the beer (I used an irish guinness).My boyfriend thought it was great as well and he is normally pretty picky,plus this is the first time I felt like I could eat chili without tons of cheese and sour cream. It tastes good just how it is, althouh I did add a bit more cayenne pepper since we live in Germany and spicy peppers are quite hard to find.

This was amazing, and I'm not even a chili lover! It was a chilly (ha ha), overcast day, perfectly suited for something like this, so I searched for something I figured I'd like, and this was it. Granted, it has lots of ingredients, but it goes quickly and doesn't need to cook all day. I added just a couple things to suit my taste, that being a few chopped chipotle peppers for that smoky taste and a tablespoon or so of barbecue sauce to give it a little sweetness. I'm now officially a chili fan!

Too sweet.  Too hot.  Too many ingredients.  Strange flavor.  My family would not eat it.

I should have known from the weird ingredients (cocoa powder and beer) that this would not be good.  It was okay, but it had such a strange flavour and smell to it, that when I served this at a party I had to put tons of shredded cheese on top to mask the weird flavour.  Everyone said it was good, but you could find much simpler recipes that are much more tasty.  I definitely won't be making this again.  It was extremely watery as well.

Great chili. I had to substitute stew meat that I had on hand for the beef sirloin and red cooking wine for the beer (1/4 cup). Then I forgot to get the hot chili peppers at the grocery store, so I threw in about 1-2 tablespoons of chopped jalapeno pepper that I had in my freezer. I simmered it for about 2-4 hours then put in crockpot for the rest of the evening. Unfortunately, my husband and I only got to have one bowl of this great chili, 'cuz it won 2nd place at our church's annual chili cookoff and of course, everyone wanted to try it and we went home with an empty pot!

I don't know that I would even give it the one star.  I couldn't even finish one bowl of this chili much less 8 servings of it.  It is too sweet and tastes an awful lot like beer.  I am not much of a beer drinker, so if you are you may really like this one.

Totally yummy, but a little too sweet, even though I used only half the sugar. Next time, I will reduce further. I doubled the recipe, had 10 people over, and they ate almost the entire pot. I paired the chili with the "Best ever corn muffins" from this site, and the people ate and ate! The chili is G O O D, really, really good. And you can easily adapt the recipe to suit you, like I left out most of the peppers because my Mom isn't into spicy stuff. I also left out the onions, because my husband is allergic to them, but upped the garlic a lot. It was just so good, and I was amazed at how much people ate. Thanks for making me look like a gourmet!

6th Place Chili. Try something else.  I cooked it exactly as directed for a chili contest in Texas (where people know their chili).  As soon as I finished cooking it, I tasted it and was so disappointed.  It's so mediocre.  It's not bad, but it's not great.  In a blind chili cook-off with 15 enteries and 12 judges, this chili got 6th place.  I was amazed it even placed.

This was fantastic.  Anyone who said the beer and coffee were overpowering probably did not cook it long enough.  I used Coor's Light and Duncan Donuts coffee.  My husband loved it, and he is very picky about his chili.

Awesome!  I don't eat chili, but I made this for my (very picky) boyfriend who does.  I've tried a few chili recipies out on him, and he's liked them all right, but this one took the cake.  He told me, "This is 400 times better than the last chili recipe you tried--this is a man's chili."  I pretty much followed the directions, except I cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 cup, which made the chili "borderline" on sweetness according to the picky bf.  Also, he doesn't like hot chile peppers, so I cut those out and added some extra pepper and chili powder instead.

This is the BEST chili I have ever tasted, its the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. After the Superbowl Party debut of this one, i had 3 different friends ask me to make it again! WE like Guiness for the dark beer and Peets Ethiopian for the coffee. Throw some Sour cream in to cut the heat.

WOW....Took the advise of others & pretty much followed the recipe as is, except for all ground beef & only 2 chili peppers. The only thing I will do different next time (& there will be a next time) will be to use 3 chili peppers & maybe a tad less cocoa powder...out of all those very different ingredients, that was the one I could pick out. Also, as per other reviewers,good the first time around...even better the next day. Makes me wish there were more leftovers in order to try for day 3. At any rate; Thanks Bob, for an outstanding chili recipe.

This chili was delicious!  I made it at home first, and then over the holidays 
I had my mom make it for a large crowd.  I was a huge hit!!  I will definitley
 be making this again. My one change was adding only 2 cans of beans.

Great! It took a few bites to aquire a taste for it, but my husband and I thought it was great. My 2 & 3 yr old ate it up. Next time I will probably add a can of rotel tomatoes and cut out the chilis.

Superb recipe, simple to make, but I cut the sugar in half as did many others as well as add a few more chiles. Fantastic flavor providing spice hidden behind an abundance of flavor.

Excellent!!  I won the chili cookoff at work with this recipe!  I added diced mushrooms, green peppers and red peppers, more hamburger and only half the beans.  I would definately make again - but next time I will add more chili and jalepeno peppers - they gave the chili wonderful flavor.  I was a little scared of the spice, but it wasn't hot at all!  thanks for a great recipe!

In all fairness, I am culinary challenged. But my version of this chili was so offensive it was laughable. When I told my husband what was in it, his response was "Well, no wonder." I was so sure this would be great from all the other reviews, I'm sure it was me. I'm not a big meat eater so I left most of the meat out AND the brown sugar figuring it wasn't key. But other than that, I followed the recipe. This was some scary chili. At least we got a good laugh. No dinner, but a good laugh.

Oh my goodness! This is an incredible recipe!  The only thing I changed was to cut the sugar in half as other reviews suggested and to cut the beer in a third (4 oz. vs. 12 oz.) - I am taking it to a church potluck LOL

The ingredients mingle so well and there is such depth of flavor!  This is becoming my permanent chili recipe.  Definitely try it!  Of course cocoa works!  It is in the spicy mexican dish "mole" - it works wonderfully in chili, too.  Thanks for sharing with us Bob!

An absolute hit with family and guests everytime. It is a nice mixture of flavors. I would add less Brown sugar (too sweet). I also think the prep time is off, it took a bit longer to prepare.

Wow, I loved this!  What unusual ingredients--beer, coffee and COCOA POWDER!  I couldn't resist!  But my family wouldn't touch it.  It is a very dark looking chili.  Too bad for them.  But I used it as a learning experience, and tried adding some of these off the wall ingredients to my own tried and true chili recipe, making it just a little more unique!

The chili was very flavorful...I used Shiner Bock for the dark beer...I felt that the coffee I used was a little too strong...I think the longer this simmers the better it tastes!

I love this recipe!  For variation I use Chocolate Stout or Guiness for the dark beer.  I also will put half of it in a casserole and cover it with a cornbread mixture and bake it.  Yummy!

I read my mother the list of ingredients and she thought I was nuts!  But I will admit that I liked the chili, though I added a little more brown sugar.  We found it even better the second day!  My two year old though it was great.

Howdy!  That is one great chili recipie.  Weird ingredients for sure, but comes out great.  I used Starbucks coffee and Guiness beer and could taste it in the finished product.  Wasn't mouth burning hot at all.  Went great with the "Absolute Mexican Cornbread" and another Guiness.  Next time, I'll splash in some habenero hot sauce and give it some *real* punch.

WOW!  Made some minor adjustments to suit my taste (no beer, but beef boullion granules and tomato sauce instead) lime juice and 1 can of diced chile peppers.  Wonderful flavor and texture.  Spicy and med-hot, just right!

Awesome chili!  My father has always thought he had a corner on the chili market - but this really out does his.  I did actually have to increase some of the spices to suit my husband - but hey, we do live in Texas.

This recipe is a hearty and tasty recipe that can easily be modified to your taste without ruining the overall flavour. I made it without he beer and coffee and it was fantastic.

Great chili! Followed the recipe but did make a couple additions, green, red and yellow peppers, chopped and added as well as cremini mushrooms and some button mushrooms and a bit more cayenne, as I like my chili super spicy. Was great with some baguette, sour cream grated cheese and green onion on top :) 
will make it again for sure with a bottle of Flying Monkeys The Chocolate Manifesto (triple chocolate stout) I want to try next time, and maybe 1/2 espresso stout :)

Very good recipe, though I did tone down the sugar to half, use 2 cans of diced tomatoes, also doubled the ground beef to two lbs and skipped the sirloin (didn't have any). I also used 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans kidney beans, instead of all kidney beans. Very tasty, my husband loves.

Excellent Recipe!  Made for Super Bowl and it was a winning touchdown.  

Only deviation from the recipe, I didn't use all the hot chili's.  I used one large jalepe√±o.  The chili was a bit on the sweet side, but will use 1/4 cup brown sugar next time.  Wonderful flavor, and is more amazing the longer it cooks or better yet the next day.  This is a keeper.  Thank You ROBTX99!

I have only tried making chili a few times, thinking it was a mysteriously cultural sort of dish.  I followed this recipe to the tee (sort of), and it was AMAZING!  I didn't have enough chili powder so I used a little chipotle.  We had the kids come over and they took all of the leftovers.  I didn't use any ground beef, substituting sirloin tips instead.  This is without a doubt the best chili I ever ate, and I'm not just saying that because I made it.  The only thing missing was cornbread.  This is a keeper!

I've made this chill maybe 30 times since I first saw this recipe, and am only now commenting on it. One thing I LOVE about it is that you can leave out certain ingredients, and it STILL tastes awesome. So many times I've been like, "Darn! I forgot the beef stock! This is gonna suck now." And NAY. Still awesome.

Far too sweet.  The next time I will use less brown sugar.  But if it tastes better the next day, as so many raters indicated, I will give it another try.  I sure hope so because I made a very large amount!!,

I thought the ingredients in this recipe (beer, coffee, and cocoa) would be an interesting spike, especially since I use cocoa and coffee in other keep-sake recipes of mine as the special hidden ingredient.  The balance of spiciness, saltiness, sourness and sweetness must be considered not only in each dish, but also between the six or more dishes shared per serving--and this recipe just didn't have it.  This dish is just a bunch of "interesting" ingredients thrown into a pot.  I didn't take the time to really read the reviews like I normally do, and wish I did.  After reading all the five stars from reviewers, they have heavily doctored and changed the recipe--of course it will be fantastic now.  One review said she has been making it consecutively for 10 MONTHS in a row in order to perfect it; a recipe that takes that long to help is one that isn't worth saving.  This chili is just OK--barely, but definitely not one I will ever make again.  One other reviewer said she doesn't think the end result is worth the effort, and I have to agree.

my fianc√© and I have made this chili recipe multiple times and it is OUTSTANDING! Everyone raves about it and we have yet to tire of it. We added the spices to our taste instead of following the measurements, we also renamed it Chewbacca Chili because it's such a hardy and stout chili that we felt it was appropriate. It is really best if you can allow it to cook and simmer all day before serving it.

Made this for the second time tonight. For the most part I really stuck to the recipe and and have to say this is just wonderful recipe. Thank you ROBTX99! I am so happy w/ the flavor, very intense and sophisticated. Hot, and sweet... worthy of a chili contest for sure! Here are my notes with just a few changes from the original ...1.5 Tbsp Williams Chili Seasoning, 1.5 Tbsp McCormick Chili Powder, 2 tsp. Chipotle Chili Powder, 1 tsp. African Bird Pepper. Steven's Point Belgian White Ale, no Cayenne, 1 lb. cubed sirloin, 1.5 lbs chili beef, 3/4 yellow onion, 2 Serranos, 1 Caribbean Red Habanero, 1 Anaheim Chile, Pintos instead of Kidney Beans

This was ok. It is sweet like the reviews say, so I would cut back on the sugar. I also made the boilermaker tailgate chili recipe from allrecipes. The boilermaker recipe has way too many ingredients, but it was really good, so perhaps it's worth all the work and ingredients. This recipe is much simpler, but wasn't as good. My husband also said he thought it needed more meat and less beans.

I took the lady's advice to try it before judging it.  I changed a couple of things to match what I had on hand.  I used very lean ground sirloin only. I did change the beans to a dark and light mix.  I used crushed tomatoes that were very thick instead of the paste.  The real secret is the coffe, chocolate, beer and brown sugar.  That gives the depth and richness I percieve.  I tried the chili before adding the chocolate, coffee and brown sugar, and it was plain and a bit flat.  Adding those three items sealed it.  I always use those three in my baked bean recipe.  I used about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, per so many people's opiniom.  I will use this  recipe again, perhaps with the sirloin cubes, to see what that might add.  Kudos, Sir!

IN ADDITION:  I won an association Chili cook off against six (6) other  contestants with my variation of this.

This is the ONLY chili I make... and have been for the past 9 years!  I use Guinness for the beer, and sometimes dutch process cocoa.  Just the right amount of heat, enough to feel it, but not so much my very mild son won't eat it.  Have won several scout "cook-off's" with this recipe.

Excellent Chili recipe. I have made this twice already this winter and I am making it again tonight.  I think I have tweaked it to my liking pretty well so this third time should be great.  Some things I have noticed.  The coffee flavor is quite strong.  I used a Starbucks dark roast the first time, and the coffee flavor was a bit strong for my liking.  I switched to a milder brew the second time and liked it much better. The spiciness level depends a lot on what peppers you use. I used two Jalapenos and some Serrano and the flavor was a bit mild for my taste. I think I could add a Habernero or two and call it good. I have also found that a little Sriracha goes really well in this Chili. I don't really like traditional Chili Beans, so I put a lot of Black Beans in mine, and it works well. Lastly, I do this crock pot style and it turns out great.  For anyone who is looking to get more adventurous with their Chili, this is a fantastic recipe to do so.  It's easily tweakable to your tastes and it's pretty solid right out of the gate.

I'm pretty sure I've tasted this before.  I definitely recall drawing out a couple of strange ingredients from a person who had the best darn chili I've eaten in quite a while.  

I tried to keep it as close to the receipe as possible, without overflowing my 3 1/2 Qt slowcooker.  I reduced my amount of beans to two cans drained and the sirloin beef was a little over 1lb, since 3/4 lb is a rarity at the store. 

I also used almost one chopped green pepper, 1 onion instead of two, Stella Belgium beer,  2 large chile peppers (which may have taken the place of 4).  I also forgot, but added 30 mins later into 10hr low cook, 1 tsp of Better than Bullion Beef Stock (no water).  

This is the 2nd chili recipe I've tried from this site, and have to say this is definitely unique and complex, and quite yummy.  The first was just so boring, it tasted like cafeteria prison food.  

It's very good as-is, but I'll be attempting with 1/4 packed brown sugar and draining/rinsing the beans and browned meat.  It was just a tad too oily, even though I drained, and just a tad too sweet.  

Kudos to the originator.  Love the hot and sweet.

This is great chili.  I did not add the 4 peppers called for, but add one teaspoon of chipolte powder.  I also only used a heaping tablespoon of the brown sugar.  It turned out great.

Excellent mix of flavours.  Perfect for a wintery day.  Very good for reheating the next day.  Goes great with a dolop of sour cream or shredded cheese.

This turned out excellent I added 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (Embasa brand) and 1 cup of chopped sweet potatoe to this recipe and it was a huge hit.  I loved the sweetness of the potatoe!  Excellent recipe

I love chili and this recipe was no exception. It did have a nice bold taste with the dark beer and coffee. Served with Absolute Mexican Cornbread.

I am an avid cook, and love to try new recipes.  When looking for a new chili recipe, this one appealed to me because it had over 1000 reviews and 18000 saves.  As suggested by some earlier reviewers, i made the recipe exactly as per the instructions the first time (except that i used ground turkey and chopped chicken rather than beef).  For peppers, i used a poblano, a jalapeno and a cubanelle.  i made it one day in advance because the consensusa among prior reviewers was that the flavors melded better over time.  This is one of the most delicious and richest chilis that i've ever had.  Everyone loved it.  I started a new batch tonight using leftover turkey from our Easter dinner.  Not sure whether i'm going to try canned chipotle chilis or use a few poblanos.  Either one would work and would add a different dimension to the chili- which i think is what i like the most about this chili, it provides a great base from which you can personalize to suit your family's tastes

This is the best chili recipe I've made yet.  I did make a couple of modifications:  I use cubanelle peppers so the fire isn't over powering, an extra bottle of Guinness, a full pound or more of sirloin (trimmed well), and cook a bit longer.  I also use a combination of beans for variety (navy and kidney most recently).

This is a very tasty and meaty chili rich in flavor. I will cut back on the sugar next time. Excellent with beer bread and/or amusement park cornbread, once again I would cut back on the sugar on either bread.

Best chili I have every had!  Used less chili powder (2T, not 3T) and it was still quite spicy. Served it with Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this site and the pairing was perfect. Didn't tell family about the coffee and beer ingredients til after they raved about how good it was.  Will be making this again!

I am not a chili person however a young man at work introduced me to this recipe and I love it.  It has very distinct flavors and is sure to please all.  Though when I prepare, I use less beans.

Halved the recipe. Adjusted the liquids to use a full can of Guinness (I added a beef bouillon cube & instant espresso powder to the beer, and added water as necessary to have the right amount of liquid). Only had ground beef so used that for the full amount of meat. I blend an all-purpose seasoning that contains all of the spices indicated (as well as cocoa powder, instant espresso powder and brown sugar) so I used that and seasoned to taste. Only used one can of mixed beans as my boys don't care much for beans. Omitted the chile peppers. Served with 'Sweet Cornbread Cake' and 'Honey Butter', both from AR.

This is the first time that I've written a Review on any website, but felt that it was necessary in this case. I followed the recipe exactly as written and have to say it was the worst chili that I have ever tasted. To me it was like drinking a thick, sweet tomato soup. I'm only sorry that I wasted all of the meat and other ingredients I used. I will try now to add a few things to change the flavor to that of real chili and hopefully make it edible. If I can't, down the disposal it goes.

By far my favorite chili recipe.  For the chili peppers I like to use 2 pablanos and 2 serranos, 1 tbsp ground cumin instead of cumin seeds, and up to 28 oz of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced.  The longer the simmer the better.

I made this exactly as written and was really disappointed with this recipe. When I saw that it used coffee and beer (my two favorite beverages) I knew I just had to try it. Unfortunately, all of these flavors just don't work together. You wind up with a chili that's too sweet and lacks kick. I won't make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly, and was impressed with the results. My husband loved the chili, and said it tasted like Wendy's. (Believe it or not, that IS a compliment!) The flavor is nicely complex - not as pedestrian as Wendy's, in my opinion. I thought there was a little too much cocoa, but I'm not a chili connoisseur. Overall, I think I would make this again for my husband, but reduce the cocoa a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this chili last night for a chili cookoff contest, and I won second!  I was super pumped!  This chili really is amazing.  I only changed a little bit of the recipe to fit my taste preference.  I used the full amount of brown sugar and I didn't think it tasted too sweet like the rest of the reviews said, although I can't handle alot of heat.  I only used 3 tablespoons of chili powder and only one jalapeno pepper.  I think the balance of sweet and spice turned out perfectly from me.  I'm totally adopting this as my go-to chili recipe!

I was tired of the same old chili that I've been making for years and thought I'd try something a bit different. Everyone that tried this loved it including myself. Many thanks to the chef!!!

I really don't eat chili but my husband RAVED about this recipe when I made it and I love the way my house smells when its cooking. We don't throw any out, he eats it for days!
Update: I now eat chili and we have been using this recipe for about 4 years as a base. My husband is more hands on making it now and he uses the different hot peppers he grows. He likes to use Sam Adams Oktoberfest for the beer and we use jarred tomatoes from his dad's garden. We also skip the oil in the beginning since the ground beef makes its own grease and we like to put sweet corn in too. Aside from that, we really don't stray from this recipe and its fantastic every time. My brother invites himself over when we make it.

This is a great recipie! Philosophically, I think of chili as a way to use up leftover stuff, or what you've got on hand, and this recipe adapts well. I made it with just under a pound of gr. beef (why can't the packages be even!) and some leftover dark meat chicken instead of the sirloin. I added this cooked chicken with the second batch of beans. We may increase the garlic next time. Oh, and I didn't have a can of peeled and diced tomatoes, so I used half a jar of commercial spahgetti sauce. I love the beer and cocoa flavors! I will definitely make this again, possibly in the crock pot, although I may have to get a pressure cooker to handle our family's increased bean consumption.

I followed the recipe as is other than cutting back the sugar some and not so many cans of beans.  We made it the night before and let it simmer in the crockpot for a few hours before retiring it to the fridge.  The next day we placed it back in the crockpot and believe me, the wait was worth it.  Trust the other reviewers when they say the next day is much better!!  I was even skeptical the night before and was worried I may have wasted a lot of ingredients.   I will make this again and again.

I read several reviews and took DAVISAM1's advice.  I cooked the chili as directed, put it in the fridge overnight andserved it the next day to my husband, sons, and son-in-law.  WOWO!  This is fantastic and not sweet anymore.  THEY ATE IT ALL! I had to cook up another pot today to chill overnight for the OU Texas game tomorrow afternoon.  I've NEVER made 2 big pots of chili in 2 days!  What a great recipe!!!  Okies and Texans alike will love this recipe.

Fantastic Recipe! This recipe has everything I look for in a recipe. It was nice and hot but it held the flaors together well. I was worried about the amout of sugar and cocoa but I trusted the recipe and it rewarded me. Of course it is better the next day as with most chili.

This is like a party in your mouth - layered flavors.  I'm not a fan of chili but this one I can't stop thinking about! Honestly, make it the day before you want to eat/serve it.  The spices need time to marry.

I've been making this for years and it's my only go to recipe. The only changes I make is to reduce the cocoa powder and brown sugar and I like to up the meat and add corn and bell peppers.

Really great! I found myself comparing it to the blue ribbon chili at the local cook off - this is way better than any restaurant chili I've had.  I did a couple things differently than the recipe. Other reviews mentioned it being too sweet so I cut the brown sugar back to 1/3 cup. I (accidentally) used too much beer and poured an entire 14.9 can of Guinness Draught in instead of only 12 oz. Can't say that was bad, though. Instead of four cans of kidney beans, I substituted two of the cans for a can of pinto and a can of black beans. Lastly, this may not be a change, but since the type of onion or chili pepper was not specified I used red onions and serrano peppers.   All in all the spiciness and overall taste was great! I'd love to find a way to improve this the next time I make it, but I'm not sure what to change.

This has been my default chili recipe since I first made it. The best beer to use, IMHO, is Lagunitas Brown Shugga because it has that slight sweetness to it. I cut down the sugar to maybe about 3 tablespoons and work my way up depending to taste. This is the best! My family and I love it!

I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past couple of years.  The flavor is incredible and the sirloin adds a great texture. However, my wife and kids don't like things too spicy, so I do not use the chili peppers.  I do slice my own peppers and add them later as a topping, along with shredded cheddar and chopped red onions.  I also add more chili powder than the recipe calls for (I add it to taste).  Everyone I have made this for has called it some of the best chili they've ever had.  The only time I've ever had better chili was at a chili cook off!  This is the perfect meal to make on a Sunday and enjoy the rest of the week!

Wicked good!  Made it for the fellas who came over to watch the Jets/Chargers game tonight.  I made two versions - one as directed and one very tame version for the kids (no beans, beer or coffee).  Both were a hit, but I even had some of the boys asking for more of the "original" version.  Great stuff!  This one is in the top 10 for sure.

I have been making this chili for over 5 years.  It is the most delicious, debt of flavor dish I make.  Kids and adults love it!!!  Obviously for kiddos leave out the peppers and beans, but for adults add both and it is ALWAYS a hit!  

I cannot tell you how delicious it is.  Just making it today for a cold snowy day in the south.  WE LOVE IT

Was way too sweet for me and my husband.  I had high hopes that it would be better the next day, based on the reviews I read, but it was still too sweet.   If I were to make this again, I'd probably leave out the brown sugar altogether.

Do not be put off my the strange ingredients.  It is a well rounded chili dish.  I am sure I would have given it 5 stars, but I messed up on the cumin.  I did not have cumin seeds, only ground cumin.  I really should have reduced the ground cumin but completely forgot.  I will review again after I make it once more (using the cumin seeds).

This takes a giant leap of faith to risk wasting almost 2 #'s of meat.  It's hard to imagine chili with coffee, cocoa & coriander.  That being said, I'm glad I took the risk--this stuff is amazing!!  As other reviewer's have noted--definitely let the flavors blend overnight.  It went from 'what have I done' to 'if I wasn't stuffed I'd have a 3rd bowl!'  Incredible!!  Thanks for the excellent reviews (I cut back on chili powder & brown sugar, used 2 seeded jalape√±os. Also increased tomatoes & mixed the beans--kidney, chili, black).  Thanks so much ROBTX99 for an excellent, though very different chili recipe!

I loved this recipe, and so did the crowd I fed with it, but tonight I'm making it again and will reduce the sugar by 3/4. I thought it was too sweet. I'll add 1/4 cup of brown sugar rather than 1 cup.    I served it with a basic cornbread recipe I found on this site and it was really excellent, very rich and flavorful, and the chocolate added complexity.

Perfect chili recipe as is. If you're very sensitive to heat or have kids that are, I would halve or omit the cayenne, but the amount here isn't spicy to my taste.

The chocolate, coffee, and sugar are well balanced and give this recipe a rich and complex flavor.  It could have been spicier for me, but my wife who doesn't like spicy foods liked it as is.

This was the best chili I have ever made!  I cut the brown sugar down to 2 T and used whatever beer I had (which wasn't dark) and I couldn't believe the flavors!  Gave the recipe to 2 friends of mine who also made it and said it was the best!  The sauce is so dark and rich! Served it at a party with every fixing you could imagine and it was gone in a flash. You really need to try this.
Added note:  Not that this chili could use any improvement, but I bought a chocolate beer (didn't know they made it ) and used instead of the beer and cocoa powder.  SO GOOD!

Never had a chili quite like this, and while the ingredients are a bit different, the combination of flavors is awesome.  I tweaked it just a little... added a little more meat, used 2 decent sized chopped jalapenos (with the seeds), and at the end, added a little water and flour just to thicken it slightly.  Everything else was done exactly to the letter.  The heat was perfect for my family's tastes, and the beer/coffee/cocoa give it a wonderful flavor.  This is now my favorite chili!

I love this Chili. I've made this recipe as is several times, but have adapted it to my taste. Instead of jalapenos I use 2-3 canned chipotles(I like the smokey flavor), also add 2-3 more cans of white kidney beans because I like more beans. As with any recipe it's an excellent base recipe you can make your own

SHOCKED!!!  This chili is now THE chili.  I always try to follow exactly the first time, but I hate kidney beans so I used 2 cans pinto, one can great northern.  I also only used 2 chopped jalepenos instead of 4 because of the kiddos.....that is all I changed....it was a HUGE hit....even with my brothers girlfriend who doesn't like chili.  Thanks for an awesome....excentric recipe.  Never could have imagined this combination would render such an intense flavor.

SIMPLY THE BEST CHILI--EVER! I have been making this chili for about 4 years and EVERYTIME I make it people are droolig and going back for seconds and then begging me for the recipe. I like a variety of beans so The only mod I make is to I add 1 can pinto and 1 can mild chili beans instead of all kidney. And I don't love cilantro so I omit the seeds but the balance of flavors is so perfect in this recipe it would be so easy to add/reduce to make it exactly perfect for your tastes. Enjoy!

The differences in mine: 

*  I omitted the oil and sirloin
*  I used 2 lbs of ground chuck
*  I added a can of extra hot Rotel
*  I used root beer instead of beer
*  I used jarred beef base instead of canned broth
*  I added some fresh tomato from the garden
*  I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar
*  I omitted the coriander
*  I used extra salt (Lowry's garlic salt & Tony's Creole seasoning)
*  I cooked my own beans the day before (1/2 lb dried kidneys)
*  I used 2 chopped jalepenos

My husband took it to work, and it got all eaten.  One guy had 5 bowls (said it was the best chili he'd had in his life) and another had 3.  It was a hit!

My husband was in a chili cook-off with my sister and father (who both think they make the best chili.) Well, my husband burnt his chili (which was probably a blessing since it didn't taste to well to begin with). Anyway, I searched the site and read the reviews and decided to make it. My husband took the credit and the 1st place ribbon. It really is a great chili!!!! Thanks for the recipe.

This was good chilli - dont get me wrong - its just that I dont think it was better than normal chilli without the weird additions (ie beer, coffee, cocoa).  My daughter wouldnt eat it - said it tasted weird - I liked it although there was an unusual flavour.  If I made this again I would leave out the beer & coffee - I would still use the cocoa as it gives a smoothness to the sauce that I really liked.

We participated in a chile cookoff last night using this recipe. We won first place! I have a coffee roasting business and we definitely wanted one that used coffee. Local businesses make up the teams and it is sponsored by our Chamber of Commerce. We made a roux with the coffee concentrate we use in our business and some flour before adding. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Excellent tasting chili. Used jalapenos instead of chili peppers. Added a half of red and green bell pepper. Used  pork steak instead of sirloin. Chopped onions and jalepenos for a topping and shredded cheddar.

I love this chili recipe! It's definitely different but in a good way. I added a can of corn, a green bell pepper and 3 jalapenos to mine for some more veggies. Makes plenty for leftovers and to freezer as well!

Amazing chili! I like my chili thick so instead of beef broth I just added beef bullion so I got the flavor without the liquid. Once the flavors meld together the results are a rich, deep flavored dark chili! We loved it!

made this with ground venison and WOW is it tasty!!!  I am making it again on Sunday with venison meat (bambi good!) I used bacon grease instead of regular oil, adds just a more smoky flavor.  I will be adding more heat to my bowl of chili, cannot make the entire chili too hot since my husband has acid reflux... 

Overall a WONDERFUL recipe!

This is- hands down- the best chili I've ever cooked!!!  I used high quality chili powder and used 2 Tbsp of regular red chili powder and 1 Tbsp of chipolte chili powder- so it was HOT.  I added a big can of crushed tomatoes (28 oz) in addition to the 1 small can and used all the brown sugar to mediate the heat from my chili powder. (Regular grocery store chili powder does NOT require the extra tomatoes and only needs a scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar- I've made it that way before too) It was perfect!  I did NOT add the beef broth because I wanted it to be thick.  This is perfect- a little hot- a little sweet and soooooooooo full of flavor.  (I used an Old Peculiar for the beer).  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!  Served with homesteader cornbread (on this site)- sooooooo good too!!!!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!!

This was better than my normal chili - by a lot, actually.  I've never used cocoa powder or coffee in my chili before, but it adds so much depth and flavor.  Yum!  I used chipotle peppers (2), which I pureed with the canned tomatoes, threw in some worcestershire sauce, used all ground turkey and less brown sugar.  It seemed rather liquidy to me (because I also went light on the beans), so I left out the can of beef broth and just threw in some granuals. It was delicious and I will likely follow this guide for all future pots of chili.  Thanks!

My husband loves this chili!  He thinks it is very good.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.. and he thought it was too "sweet" - so I took the advice of others and only added 1 tbps of brown sugar.  I also cut back on the beans and used 2 cans and only used ground beef for the meet.

This is one of the best chili I have ever made. Don't be put off by the ingredients..sounds weird but it makes for a great full bodied chili. The only thing I'd changed was the amount of brown sugar..I think I'd only used about 1/4 of a cup and I didn't use sirloin. I'd just used 2 pounds of extra lean ground beef instead. 
Also after I'd sauteed everything and let it simmer for about 10 minutes on the stove I'd transfered it to my slow cooker. 

This one is a keeper.

Good Lord!  This is some good stuff!  I followed it almost exactly except for the following: 1) 2 lb ground beef just because I didn't have any sirloin; 
2) Used 1/4 cup brown sugar as per other suggestions; 
3) Did not use as much salt; 
4) Used 1 can each: dark red kidney, light kidney, black beans, pinto beans; 
5) Did not use hot peppers.

Awesome chili.  The only thing I changed was the brown sugar.  Using only 1/4 cup is the perfect amount.

The description mentions ground cumin, but the recipe calls for cumin seeds?  I used cumin seeds but will definitely switch to ground next time around.  
I love the depth of flavor in this chili and will definitely make it again.  I halved the sugar and will probably use even less next time as well.
The only big change I made was to use fire roasted tomatoes, which were delicious.

This Chili has a great taste and great bite. I wowed my family with this one. I cut the coffee and sugar in half and only used ground beef. Next time and there will be a next time I may cute the heat down a little for the kids. Overall this is probably the best beef chili recipe I've seen.

I've made this chili several times, and always get rave reviews.  It's become known among my family and friends as "my" chili recipe (although none of them know I got it on the internet).  The coffee, beer and cocoa powder combine for such a rich, complex flavor.  I can't get enough of this stuff!  For people who aren't crazy about spicy food, I'd suggest easing up on the chili powder and using mild peppers.  Personally I like it just the way it is.  Bottom line: modify ingredients to taste if necessary, but this recipe deserves no less than 5 stars!

Amazing Chili recipe and a real crowd pleaser. I make this chili at least once a month and never tire of it.  Leftovers freeze well and we have a new family favorite with the leftovers - we serve this over noodles with grated cheese, onions and pickled jalapenos. . .sort of our take on Cincinnati style chili.

This chili is amazing! I've been making it for 5 years and I wouldn't change a thing! 

If you do make it - please follow the recipe as is. Some of the ingredients seem unorthodox where chili is concerned, but trust me and many other reviewers when we say that it really is the best chili ever!!

We've been making and sharing this recipe for 3 years.  There's not a better chili recipe out there.  This one is king!!!!!  The only change we make is increasing the beef sirloin from 3/4 pound to a full pound.  Try this recipe and you will be a fan yourself.  Thanks Bob for a great recipe!!!

I LOVE this chili.  A great sweet dark chili.  I have made this several times but increase the number of chili peppers (a lot) and I don't bother to remove ribs and seeds for extra heat. I also use one bottle of guinness in place of the beer and coffee.

Do make this recipe as it is written and you'll see that is an excellant dish. I was concerned about the various ingredients and my husband didn't want me to use the coffee or cocoa, but I did and it was great! Every family member liked the flavors and consistency. I'll put in less sugar next time as it was just a bit sweet for my taste - but again, it is such a great recipe. Adventurous and yummy!

2 words...  FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!  I just won a chili cookoff with this recipe.  I did make some minor changes; used hot italian sausage, half the tomato paste, half the brown sugar, used Guiness beer and Starbucks coffee.  I was also only able to fit 3 cans of beans into the crockpot, so I used one can black beans, one can light kidney and one can hot chili beans.  Will make again, the only thing I will do different is save some for me...  my crockpot was empty when I left!  Thanks Bob!

OUTSTANDING!  Most complex flavors I've ever tasted in a chili.  I agree with other reviewers that the brown sugar needs to be cut in half.

I make this recipe every year. i am vegetarian so i add veggie crumbles instead of meat. i also omit the beef broth and just add another can of tomatoes. I also use about 1/3 to 1/2 a small can of diced canned jalapenos instead of fresh ones. I love this recipe and can't wait every year to make it in september and october. my mother-in-law says it is the best chili she has ever had.

I thought the flavor of this chili was very good, but it had no heat.  I used 4 jaleno peppers.  Next time I will try something much spicier.  I used all ground beef.  I made it for my Superbowl party (Yay Steelers!) and everyone gobbled it up, even the kids.

Let me tell you, Bob delivers on his promise.  
Here's what I wasn't so sure about:
1. What kind of onions did he prefer to use?  I went with white.
2. Ground Beef I used 80/20 
3. I thought chuck eye was ideal for this recipe as it‚Äôs cheaper, has more marbling than sirloin, and it's delicious. 
4. "dark beer" is extremely vague to me. Did he use "Stouts" (like Guinness)or "Ales" (Newcastle)or "Lagers' (Yuengling)? I went with a Sam Adams Winter Lager. 
5. I lightly salted and peppered the meats, additionally seasoning the chuck eye with a couple 2-3 pinches of Lowry‚Äôs seasoning salt. 
I browned the cubed meat FIRST, then ground beef, and THEN I added the onions. Then I added the garlic. I decided to hold off on the final can of beans as it was now a little bean heavy (even to this bean lover).  
I know what it means to slow simmer, and that‚Äôs what I did, and I feel that it cooked down a little too much, even though my desired result was a thick chili.  Next time I‚Äôll either cook it 30-40 minutes less, or add a little water in the end.
A lot of reviewers said this recipe was too spicy.  I‚Äôm no fire head, but I thought it could have been considerably hotter.  And I used jalape√±os for my chili peppers.  Next time I will double the amount of cayenne pepper, as cayenne isn‚Äôt a brutal heat, and has a nice flavor.
All in all, I liked this recipe a lot.  Next time I‚Äôll probably cut back on the ground beef and double the amount of cubed chuck eye steak..  Thanks Bob!

WE tried this recipe on reccommendation from one of my coworker and I love this chili recipe!  I cooked it with 2lbs of lean ground beef and added 2 cans of pinto beans and 2 cans of kidney beans.  My husband and neighbors loved it.  We used Starbucks Verona coffee like we normally brew in the mornings and used Firestone Double Barrel Lager (dark amber beer).  This chili was FABULOUS!  We are making it again this weekend with Guiness and 1 can of navy beans.  The options are endless!  This is a MUST try.

I served this to guests and they could barely eat it. Came out a little too spicy. Even my husband could barely get it down. Makes a lot more than 8 servings, and I had to spoon out about 4 ladle - fulls to make it less soupy.

From the reviews, I expected a great tasting chili that would appeal to everyone in my family.  I followed the recipe exactly but found that it was a little sweet and had an unusual taste that my kids did not like.  My husband liked it but was the only one out of four.

This is a very good recipe I used a teaspoon of Habanero Tabasco sauce which more than offsets the  brown sugar I actually used 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar and an extra table spoon of cocoa powder, the Habanero sauce gives the chili a little tropical influence since the sauce includes mango,banana,tamarind and papaya puree, I also used jack daniels instead of beer and pinto and black beans along with the kidney beans. I would suggest using less cayenne/chili powder and use mild chili peppers since the habanero sauce is plenty hot enough.

A very different flavor on this chili...the family wasn't wild about it.  It took forever to make, and it was a disappointment after seeing all the good reviews.

WOW!  Who'da thunk that such an eclectic combination of ingrediants could be so delicious??  Got RAVE REVIEWS from BF and bro...only changes I made: 5 cloves garlic, halved the brown sugar (and PLENTY sweet enough!!!), 1 kidney and 1 great northen bean right off, then another kidney later, increased toms to 3 cans and it was PERFECT, and used 3 large jalepanos as our grocery didn't have hot chiles (God bless MT eh??)  THIS RECIPE IS KICK'N!

Absolutely delicious. Due to my lack of a few ingerdients, I fudged a little bit on this recipe but apparently not enough to change the flavor to something unsavory. The only thing I might do differently next time (and there will be several next times) is add a little less brown sugar. It was JUST a little too sweet for me, but the rest of the flavor was right on. It wasn't hot enough to set your mouth and lips on fire, but there was a good warm heat after you ate your first few bites. Excellent.

I am not a chili fan but I made this recipe for a chili cook off and I won first place. They said when you put it in your mouth it doesn't taste spicy but just as it goes down it hits ya! They all loved it and I gave the recipe to quite a few people. The only thing I changed is that I only put a 1/4 cup of brown sugar in and I put 3 cans of kidney beans in. I also didnt have cumin seeds so I just used ground cumin ( 1/2 Tbsp.) As the beer I used Guiness. Thanks for a fantastic chili recipe Bob!

This chili is great.  I have made it several times now, and everyone loves it.  The coffee, beer, and cocoa powder gives it a unique flavor.  I usually make it with just ground beef because I never have sirloin handy and it still tastes great.  Also peppers can be added, or taken away to appeal to everyones heat level.  Thanks for the great recipe

I have made this recipe on several occasions, using many of the additional suggestions from these reviews, and it is definitely my favorite chili recipe.  I put it to the test yesterday, in a chili cook-off with some pretty serious contenders.  I didn't expect to win, but by an almost unanimous vote, I did!  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe that i have made many times. For a variation try adding less ground beef and replacing it with a smoked or spicy sausage. I made it for friends and it was agreed that it added a whole dimension to the recipe.

Despite the high average rating and the dominance of positive comments, I was a skeptic. (I thought people were either prone to hyperbole, or Bob had a large family posting reviews.) 

But it really is as good as people say it is. I'm a really bad cook, and even I was able to make the best pot of chili I've tasted...and I've tasted a lot of chili. (I'm a bad cook, but a great eater.)

My advice is to make it the first time "as is." (I don't normally like sweet-tasting chili either, but using the recommended 1/2 cup wasn't a problem for me.) Several of the negative reviews noted that they changed the recipe, and that may be the problem. 

Don't be put off by the weird ingredients (have you seen that sweet potato burrito recipe on this site--another example!) Awesome chili.

Excellent!  The beer is a must and don't worry about the alcohol...it will evaporate while it cooks in just a few minutes.  The last 5 minutes of cooking I added 1/2 chopped cilantro and the juice of 1 fresh lime.  I served it with Chili Fritos brand corn chips, shredded chedder cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.  My family and guests loved it!

This is a wonderful chili. I was a little nervous about whether or not the beer or chocolate would be noticible in the final product but after cooking for a few hours all of the flavors meld together beautifully and no one ingredient stood out. I thought there might be too much liquid at first but trusted another reviewer's comment and when completely cooked the chili ended up the perfect consistency. The only ingredient I didn't use was the cubed sirloin and instead just doubled the ground beef. We like our chili over thick mashed potatoes. I'm glad I made a double batch!

I just placed first place tonight in a chili contest with this recipe as a base! I did cut down the brown sugar, added roasted red peppers, montreal steak seasoning and jalapenos in place of the chiles. Also, I did half the beef broth and used spicy V8. It was excellent. When I told people the ingredients they were skeptical but in the end...they came to realize. I did change this a recipe bit but it was a great recipe to start with. This is now a standard in my book. Oh, also be sure to use a nice dark beer. If it is cooked for several hours on low the taste really melds together nicely!

Best chili I've ever tasted.  I've made this chili probably 10 times now.  I think it's best with Guinness or Guinness Extra Stout.  And it's *definitely* better the second day after it's been in the refrigerator overnight.  Excellent beyond description with some shredded extra sharp cheddar and a big spoonful of sour cream on top, and tortilla chips on the side.  Also excellent with ground turkey or chicken instead of ground beef, and cubed chicken breast instead of sirloin.

My husband thought this recipe was great. It was tangy, but not hot. I will be making this again and again. It has a lot of ingredients, but well worth it. I could not find the Cumin seed so I used 1/2 tablespoon of ground Cumin.

I was a little apprehensive about making this chili because of the ingredients, and after I made it, I had to do some tweaking because we don't like sweet chili.  I added 2 capfuls of liquid smoke, and about 6 shakes of worchestershire sauce. Next time I will not add the brown sugar at all.   Instead of using tomato paste as called for in the recipe, I used 2 can of chili diced tomatoes and no beef broth.  I figured if it needed it when I got through, I could add it then.  I also only added 2 cans of kidney beans and that seemed to be plenty.  I only rated this 3 stars because of all th adjustments I had to do, but overall, it was pretty good.  Trying it on hubby tonight.

I agree with most of the reviewers who stated this chili was too sweet.  It also tasted like a spaghetti-red concoction, which I was not looking for.  I was so excited to try it because of all the rave reviews, but sadly disappointed.  I think it has some elements that are worth keeping.  When or if I try this again, I will only add alittle sugar to taste (1T?), omit the tomato paste--this is what is overwhelming and makes it taste like spaghetti sauce.  I did not have ground coriander, but I doubt it would have altered the taste.  I used 1T of ground cumin vs. cumin seeds.  I also added some roasted red peppers.  Used only a few cans of beans and 1 onion.  1 can of green chilies, depending on how hot it is preferred.  Overall, this was just soso.

I tripled this recipe to feed 30 for a potluck.  I made it a day ahead because chili is always better the next day.  It did have a pretty strong coffee flavor at first, but after sitting overnight and reheating it was absolutely perfect, and I received many many compliments.  Made exactly as listed except I halved the amount of beans, and it was PERFECT!!

Wow.  This was a dynamite chile.  I agree with the people who said it reminded them of a Cincinnati chile but it has no cinnamon, so it was closer to a sweet texas chile than a 'nnati.  Made some sweet cornbread to go with it, and it was a huge success.  I added xtra cayenne for heat after trying the finished product (my house likes to bring the fire).  As is though - a great recipe for any chilly day.

Excellent recipe.  I gave it 4 because, as others have said, this is MUCH better the next day, so it can't be thrown together for an evening meal.  It was edible the first night, but that was about it.  The next day, however, it was awesome!  I used Amber Bock also (I was contemplating Sam Adams' Triple Bock, but wasn't sure if that would be too dark or not), and used a combination of Serrano and Habenero peppers for the "hot chile peppers".  This goes in my box, but only if I make it on Saturday to have for Sunday's dinner

This chili was a very interesting one.  I made it for a Chili Cook Off on the 17th of October and we took 2nd place in the judges taste test and 1st place in the People's Choice.  There were 33 teams entered.  We altered the recipe a bit.  We only used half of the brown sugar and 2 cans of the kidney beans.

This was my first time making chili. I found it a bit time consuming to prepare, but it was worth it. I used Guinness for the beer and 4 different types of beans instead of all kidney beans. I will make one change for next time. I will omit the brown sugar. I cut it down to 1/4 cup according to the other reviews and it was still too sweet for my liking. Otherwise, a great recipe!

This was quite the crowd pleaser!  I doubled the recipe and prepared it in a 10 quart stock pot.  I found it best to saute the onions and garlic separately as well as brown the beef cubes and ground beef separately.  I used a large mixing bowl to contain the items before adding into the chili pot.  This method allowed me to drain off a lot of fat from the beef before adding in.  The rest of the ingedients I combined in the stock pot and brought up to temperature before adding in the beef, onions, and garlic.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out very nice. I do suggest though, that if you're cooking on an electric stove, don't turn it all the way down to LOW when simmering.  Keep it a notch or two above.  After adding the last batch of beans, 30 mins later, they were still not tender enough.  I also suggest simmering as long as possible to make the beef cubes more tender.  I made a double batch (we're freezing half of it)... we're expecting friends this weekend and I can't wait for them to have some.  And of course, don't forget the shredded cheese and sour cream.  YUM!  Thanks Bob!

Bob, I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!  You are a chili makin' wizard :)  This is the best chili I have ever tasted!!!  Suggestion to those who do not like spicy foods--omit the fresh chili peppers and some of the cayenne.  But to those who can handle it--this chili is wonderful as is.

This chili turned out very good. I took another reviewer's advice and I did not make any variations to the recipe since this was the first time I've tried this chili. It tasted different from the chili I usually make, but thats what I expected. I think the sweet taste makes it unique. I will not ditch my other chili recipe, but I will make this one again for a little change of pace. It is worth a try unless you already know that you do not care for a sweeter chili.

Thick, not overwhelminly spicy, and hearty.  Awesome Chili!  My husband, like others mentioned in these reviews suggested that this chili is better than his.  Being that he proclaimed himself the Chili King, I did feel a little smug on this one.  When looking for a chili recipie, I noted all the ingredients, and a few non traditional ones and took this as a "chili cookoff type of chili" and went for it.  No regrets!  I was unable to obtain tomato paste.  I live in the boonies and the lone supermarket does not sell it, so I pureed an additional can of diced tomatoes.  Chili peppers were also not available, so I added an extra tsp on chili powder.

Loved this Chili Recipe. Served to my husband who is not big on Chili at all and he loved it. I made this in the slowcooker on low for about 10 hours. It appeared a little thin so I thickened it with a corn/flour water mixture (similar to thickening gravey) and let it go for a while longer. Also substituted 2 cans of the Kidney beans in exchange for 1 can of corn - added some color. Even better the next day.

This is awesome chili! Some of the ingredients seemed odd, but I figured `why not!`. It all blended together and had great flavor. I read other review and decided to use a variety of beans(2 cans kidney, 1 pinto, 1 black). I used cubed venison steak instead of sirloin. It had to simmer for about 5 hours for the steak to tenderize, but it was wonderful! I also cut down on the sugar since I had read other reviews and we were eating it the same day we made it. If you like spicy food, I think this chili was just the right balance of spicy & sweet.

I truly believe that anyone who says that they didn't like this recipe must have done something wrong.  It is TERRIFIC and I HATE chili.  As many others did, I too omited the sirloin because I felt that the other flavors would overpower it, and I'm glad I did.  I also used Coors Lite instead of dark beer because that's what I had in the house.  I used mild peppers (by accident) and then added some Tabasco sauce.  I made this the day before Super Bowl for my hubby since I'm going to a scrapbooking convention.  It worked out great,(making it the day before) because as many reviewers stated, "It tastes even better the next day!"  Yum, and GO RAIDERS!!!!

We really didn't care for this. The flavor seemed very strong and bitter. I hated to throw all of it away so I strained off and discarded the liquid and made my normal chili base for the remaining meat. It was pretty good the next day.

I entered this chili in our local chili cook-off and it did not fare very well.  Many of the "judges" felt that it was too mushy.  It does have a good flavor, though.

Absolutely LOVED this chili.  I of course made some modifications.  Substituted ground pork for half the ground beef.  Was nice, but not a huge difference.  I think all-beef would have been even better.  Cut back on the amount of sugar as people recommended.  Also reduced the amount of beef stock as the chili seemed wet enough.  Even relocated Texans approved of this recipe.

This is the same recipe, word for word, posted by Bob in 2003.  Is this the same person as "Bob"?  It is my all-time favorite for chili.  Following this recipe, my husband has won the chili cook-off at work three years in a row.

Great chili! For an earthier flavor I added an extra tablespoon of Chili Powder, Cumin, and Unsweetened cocoa. Left out the chilies. My hubby's fishing buds all wanted the recipe!Thanks for sharing, Bob.

Like this one needs another review!  I used half the brown sugar as suggested, added a green and a red pepper, and skipped the hot peppers.  It was still pretty spicy!  My 12 yo daughter prefers my chili,(which is basically spaghetti sauce with chili powder and beans)that just means that I get this all to myself!!!  The last time I made it for the folks at work, and they all raved about it!

WOW! This chili will make you look like a primo cook...guaranteed!  I doubled this recipe to serve a gang and EVERYONE loved it.  The unusual ingredients meld together so wonderfully and it is like no other chili that I have ever tasted.  If you are looking for a great chili recipe look no further. YUMMY!  Thanks Bob!

We thought this was quite good.  Next time, though, I'll use only 8 oz of beer and I'll make sure it's bitter dark beer, not regular.  Yummy!

Very Good.  Made with Great Northern and Kidney Beans.  Used Yuengling Lager and Local Coffee shop's Sumatra Blend.  This will become my standard recipe for Chili.  Did require some effort to prepare, but worth it.  Thanks Bob, nice job.

This recipe was very Good!  My husband, brother and father, and mother all loved it, I was not as big of a fan, only because I knew what was in it.  I usually make mine from a mix, (and will again) this is a little work, but they all say it is worth it!  Will make again!  SOON

What a treat for breakfast!, We loved it! We could not believe the ingredients, sugar, beer, coffee and coco! My family enjoyed it too and took the rest of a 5qt pot to work for our team meeting and it was gone. This is a repeat order in the near future.  One thing different I added a bottle of 6 oz of extra-hot hot sauce due the sweet flavor it had and left the coco out,  the hot sauce gave it a extra kick to it.

Excellent!  I used Boddington's beer (The Cream of Manchester) added a green & red pepper, threw it all in the crockpot and let it simmer all day.

When I first looked at it I thought it was awful, but after cooking, it was truly something special. The best chili I've ever made!

I served it with grated double Gloucester cheese and half-fat creme freche.  Yumm!!

It was worth all the tears (from cutting the onions).  I used black beans and added a habanero pepper for spice (I was out of cayenne).  1/2 hour into cooking it smelled AWFUL but a day later- after the flavors had time to blend, it is AWESOME! What a great recipe- It almost rivals the MEXICAN CORN chowder (found at this site). I'll definitely make this again and again.

I was intrigued by the unique ingredients, so I had to try it.  One thing I need to point out here is if you do not like beer or coffee then don't make this recipe.  I could defintately strongly taste both of them in the chili.  If you like beer and coffee on their own, then this is the recipe for you.  It was definately a thick, dark chili but I won't be making it again.

Weird recipe.  We had fun making it, but threw the whole batch out after trying the first bowl.  Too sweet - and the dark beer/coffee flavor was just bizarre.  Made for a fun day of cooking together, though!

Our teen-agers loved this. What an economical way to feed their hungry friends! The leftovers were just as good. We even froze a batch and thawed it out a week later when our son and friends showed up from college unexpectedly. They thought we had slaved all day!

I made this recipe for our Super Bowl party, and there was nothing left. It has a kind of smoky flavor, which may come from either the beer or the coffee.  I think it's a recipe worth trying, because it may suit your taste. Personally, I will continue my search for a recipe that I enjoy more.

Greate recipe!  I used only 4-6 cans of beans (with some black beans).  Also I increased the ground beef by 1/2 a pound.  For the chiles I used 5 red chiles, 3 green chiles, 1 serrano pepper, and 1 habanero.  It has medium-hot spicy-ness.  Once it sits, though, the leftovers will be a bit hotter.

I left out the sugar both times I have made this. I thought the consistency was a little too thick and it was heavy on the meat and beans when I made it the first time, so I cut out 2 cans of beans and added 3 cans of diced tomatoes in garlic. I also added another onion. PERFECT!

Great recipe to have on a cold snowy night. Liquidy and different flavors at first, but as it simmered, it thickened up nicely and the flavors mingled perfectly. Reminded me of the difference between a just opened bottle of cabernet and the remarkable taste after it has been allowed to breathe for awhile. After reading other reviews I chose to cut sugar back to 1/4 cup. Also, didn't use the fresh chili peppers as I didn't have them, but added a bit of habenero sauce instead. Used only 3 cans of beans total. Excellent recipe - can't wait to have it after it has aged a couple of days in the refrigerator!

The flavor is unbelievably good. It's complex and delicious. Shades of mole. Perfect, utterly perfect, chili for the whole family. I serve it over fritos with sharp cheddar cheese, and sour cream on top. Chili Pie! Won a office chili cook-off with this recipe!

4/9/19  I've made this wonderful chili numerous times over the past 8 years, but never added peppers.  Today I added less than recipe calls for:  I don't care for the burning sensation on the roof of my mouth, and for me the hotness just took away from enjoying all the flavors.  I am sad, but now I know  *smile*

I've made this recipe 10+ times now, and it is my go-to recipe for a great pot of chili that everyone can enjoy. Make this as-is and it's a complete winner, but after making it so many times, I've made a few tiny adaptations:

1 - I use 50% less brown sugar, and 50% more cocoa powder. It cuts the sweetness down. 
2 - I use three cans of beans, not two. 
3 - I finish it with a splash of white vinegar about 30 minutes before it's finished, just to 'tang' it up a bit. 

Really good recipe, it's a hall-of-famer.

Came out excellent & it was a hit, I scaled back on the sugar a little only used 1/3 cup  absolutely no sweetness issues at all.  Also used strong Spanish espresso instead of coffee and a local stout. I cut back on the beans by a can and used 1 1/2 lb sirloin ground and 1 lb cubed . Next time I may try adding a little bacon to it. It was good on the first day, but letting it cool  and reheating the following day it was spectacular, the flavors really came out. I definitely recommended letting this sit for a day before eating if you can wait.  I garnished it with some cheddar & had cornbread on the side. This recipe is definitely a keeper sooo good!

I have won two chili cook-offs with this recipe and plan on winning again this weekend. My only change is to use 1lb each of the ground and cubed beef and I sear the cubes before combining them with other ingredients. I also use only one chili pepper for more mass-appeal.

I don't care for chili, but my girlfriend said she was making it for dinner, so I thought, "Well, why not find a recipe and give it a try."  I read the reviews before I made it.  Initially, the lovely photo of the chili is what caught my eye.  I made this with the spices I had.  1) I used powdered chipotle chile pepper for the cayenne, 2) Powdered cumin because I didn't have the seeds, and 3) 2 tbsp. chili powder for the 3.5 tbsp.  

I also didn't use the hot chile peppers because I am not a big fan of too much heat in my food nor is my tummy.

It was terrific!  I liked the sweetness from the brown sugar, as it balanced out the strong coffee, dark beer and some of the heat.  Although, some here might laugh at the "some of the heat" statement.  :-)

This is a keeper and will make it again.

This is an excellent chili with wonderfully complex flavor, but even after reading the reviews and halving the brown sugar, it was two sweet for us, so I knocked a star off.  I like some sugar in my chili recipes, but not so much that it is so noticeable. I even waited a few days to write this review,  thinking the sweetness would subside after hanging out in the fridge a bit, but it didn't. That being said, the complexity and texture was wonderful, so I will make this again, but will cut back the sugar to 1/8 c to see if that is the ticket.  The spice was just right for us (I cut back on the cayenne and peppers because I'm pretty wimpy) Followed the recipe as written with the following changes: 2 kidney beans/2 pinto beans; 1/4 c brown sugar; 1/4 t cayenne and 2 hot chile peppers.  I feel these changes did not make enough difference to the recipe to alter the rating. Once I get the sweetness where I want it, this will be a strong 5.

This is the definition of chili for me!  It's sweet, spicy, and full of complex flavor.  I make the recipe as is and it always comes out perfectly.  Leftovers the next day are even better.  I usually freeze half the recipe for dinner another day and it thaws out wonderfully as well.  A total win.  This will be "my" recipe for chili from now on.

This was really delicious. I was very intrigued by the idea of adding the Guinness and it was very rich and had real depth. I will make it again and again

This is the best chili I have ever eaten!!  I used red chili flakes instead of the chilis (because I was too lazy to go the store).

This is the best chili recipe I've ever tried. I made some modifications to suit my family. I substituted ground turkey and chicken broth.  I also left out the hot chili peppers.  I used four different kinds of beans.  The coffee, dark beer and cocoa powder really make this chili exceptional.

I did make a few changes but the chili was amazing! I only used 1 pound of ground beef and skipped the sirloin to make this more budget friendly. I also used 2 cans of red kidney beans, 1 black beans, 1 pinto. Also, a large can of tomatoes. I like runny chili and I thought it was perfect. Fantastic flavor!

Best chili ever! My family's meals consist mainly of recipes on this website, and this is by far the best. We didn't change anything with the recipe, and it is perfect as it is. This is definitely worth the effort! It also makes a LOT of chili, so you will have plenty of leftovers.

Hands down this is the best Chili recipe on the PLANET!!!  I do not care for chili, I make it because my family loves it.  With that being said, I am now converted..........I have made this chili for all kinds of large group gatherings and repeatedly get asked for the recipe.  Just simply follow the recipe, don't leave out ingredients!!!  Fool proof!

I needed a recipe for a chilli cook off and went with this. I know I don't like too sweet so I cut the brown sugar down to 1/3cup and added whole 14.9oz of guiness. I also used one habenaro pepper instead of chillies. ITS AWESOME!!! Just enough heat and sweet. The complexity of the cocoa powder and beer are beautiful!!! This is now my goto chilli recipe!

Great recipe, I make this for the most part as is...with a couple exceptions. Depending on who I am making it for, I will use ground venison instead of beef. I also cut back on the sugar. I do not like a "sweet" chili. After making it following the recipe I have since switched to using a solid baking chocolate. I prefer using either 60% bittersweet or 100% unsweetened cocoa and not milk chocolate. I also use a mix of beans: black, kidney and pinto. The spices used are in the perfect proportion, and wouldn't modify a thing there.

Amazing. I only added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, then I added some green and  red bell peppers, and some celery. I also let it simmer for a bit longer. 
I paired this with a salad and my cornbread with jalapenos. Amazing meal. leftovers for lunch were amazing. :)

Unique ingredients make a delicious flavor! I love how the spices blend with the sweetness.  I didn't change a thing except I used kidney and black beans together.  We topped it with shredded Mexican cheese and a dollop of sour cream.The family loved it.

This recipe is too sweet for chili. Some of the other spices gave it an unusually dull taste as well, which I didn't like. I had to doctor it up just to make it palatable, and then it was just ok.

Wow! This was my first attempt at chili and my husband and I loved it! I was hoping my kids would eat it so I cut the cumin coriander and Cayenne in half. We don't like a lot of beans so I only used two cans. I used one can of red kidney beans which I washed with water ans 1 can of chili beans including the jalapeno sauce. I also used diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Finally I only used one large jalapeno pepper and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Thanks. Will make again soon!!

One of the best chilis I've ever made. I read the negative reviews saying that it was too sweet as is, and knowing I don't like sweet chili, I left out the brown sugar and was thrilled with the results!

It was good enough that I've made it a couple of times. Next time I will make it with 3 cans of beans, however. 4 cans of beans is just too many, even for a family that enjoys beans as much as my family does.

I love this recipe! Tastes so much like my mom's chili (which my boyfriend calls "Christmas Chili" because of all the flavors), which is so amazing. I add in cinnamon sticks, leave out the chili peppers and use four different kinds of beans. I throw everything in the crock pot to cook all day while I'm at work - coming home to this chili all ready to eat is so comforting and absolutely delicious!
Throw a little cheese and sour cream on top and get some corn bread to go with it and you're all set. Yummm.

Even with half the brown sugar, it was on the sweet side.  We added another can of tomatoes and a teaspoon of vinegar and it helped cut the sweetness. I would add sugar one tablespoon at a time.  Otherwise, a great recipe!

This chili was so amazing! I used 2 jalapenos, a hot pepper and a habanero pepper. I didn't think it was too sweet at all. I even added a little ketchup. I think I did cut the sugar a tiny bit though because I didn't have the full amount on hand. This was the first time I ever made chili and I won the family cook off!

This was an excellent recipe. If you like strong flavors like dark chocolate and dark coffee, you will enjoy it. For a less spicy version for my guests, I used two poblano peppers and two jalape√±os, and I used a milder cayenne pepper. I also used 100% dark baking chocolate in place of cocoa powder.

I read all the reviews saying this recipe was too sweet so I reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  What a mistake!  I could not even taste the sweetness so next time I will use the 1/2 cup measurement.  I also do not like it hot so I added only 1 poblano pepper but I will try 2 next time.  I did use all the chilli and cayenne and liked it....

Made a big batch of this chili.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the results pretty underwhelming at first, so I let it sit in the fridge overnight and tried it again the next day -- delicious!  Will make this again but give it more time to develop the flavors.

Everybody loves this chili.  It has a different flavor than most.  I alter the taste slightly by adding less chili powder & no cayenne pepper to suite my younger children.  I also add less brown sugar & more beef broth. I get asked for this recipe alot!  That is a testament in itself!

Yep, it's really good.  I am *not* a chili lover but DH and the kids are so I made it for them and I couldn't stop "tasting" from the pot!  I had to sub a bit on the beans; I didn't have 4 cans but it was all good.  Has been added to the repertoire.

I made this recipe lastnight and it was amazing! I agree it was a bit sweet; I will decrease the brown sugar by half next time. I look forward to tring it again today to see if the sweetness has subsided. I used two jalapeno peppers and 4 serrano peppers (seeds removed). I chose Shiner's Bohemian Black Lagar for the dark beer. I didn't use beans. My husbands believes beans don't belong in chili. I doubled the sirlion and used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef. Thank you Rob for the amazing recipe!

This is first class. The only alteration I would make is using a little less beer and a little less garlic. It is otherwise superb.

Okay this is amazing chili. I've made this about 5 times. The last 2 times I omitted the meat because I've recently become a vegetarian and its still great. I add carrot, green and red pepper and corn when I do it vegetarian style. I never add the coffee because I'm scared of the flavor and caffeine. I also never add the cocoa because I never have any, but I'd be willing to try! Also, the last time I threw in dry beans and everything cooked fine, but harsh on the digestion tract. If you throw in dry beans- make sure to rinse them GOOD!

This recipe is a copy from Sam Adams.  It is intended for a bottle of the Boston Lager.  I make it at least once year for football sunday with my buddies.  Recipe is good as is.  The longer it simmers the better it gets.

I fed this to a group of friends and they loved it.  I was really worried about it the day before, but, like others said, it settled over night and ended up being amazing.  I tripled the recipe, but left the coffee at 1 cup.  I'm really sensitive to the coffee taste so I didn't want too much.  

Great recipe!  Thanks.

Not sure what chili most of the rest of you ate, but this was the worst chili ever...Entered a chili cook off at work (with 17 total entries) they allowed two recipes per entrant so I made my usual and decided to try this one as my second entry for something sweeter. My original came in second place and this one came in dead last. Dont waste your time on this one.

Today I made this recipe for the first time. Maybe I should have followed the recipe exactly, but I made a few changes of my own. I did not have any dark beer. So I used what I had and it was light. But I used Dark brown sugar. I also did not have any cumin seed so I used the powder. And used Celery seed along with it. I added a couple other things like chili sauce. I had no puree so I used tomato sauce. All in all it is wonderful. I let it simmer in a crock pot all night and took it to work Wow!!! everyone loved it. It is a little sweet but with the heat you can't beat it.

This is pretty good chili, but a little too sweet for my taste. I halved the cayenne and the heat was still there but at a level my kids could tolerate. I added a touch of soy sauce and a dash of liquid smoke. Those changes, plus cheese on top, made the dish much more to my liking.

This recipe was the first chili recipe I have ever made, loved the sweetness, smokiness, and slow heat that this recipe has, I used 1 bottle of guinness, omitted the 3/4 pound beef sirloin, and doubled the ground beef, I also omitted the chile peppers, this still had the perfect blend of spicy, next time I would only use a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

This is very good chili.  The green chili's made it too hot for my taste, but everyone else in my household enjoyed it.  Also, I had no dark beer, so I just used what I had on hand.

Excellent recipe!  It was a little sweet initially, but it definitely mellows out after cooking or the next day.  We did use 2 cans of black beans to replace the kidney beans which I thought added a better flavor.  We also used a couple of Anaheim chilis to add color/flavor as well as two jalapenos.

In case anyone is scared off by the price of sirloin: I've made this a few times using just ground beef, and it's great. I decided to skip the brown sugar, a bit too sweet for me, and I'll add other veggies if I have them. This is a great, versitile recipe- great flavors and easy to adapt to whatever is in your pantry.

This has been our favorite chili recipe for years. I make this to satisfy my husband's craving for red meat. It stores beautifully in the freezer. I vacuum seal individual servings so he can have chili anytime. He likes his served over Fritos and topped with cheese.

I'm giving it 4.5. I didn't sense the overwhelming "strange order/taste" that some had experienced. I cut the recipe in half since it was just two of us, so I just kind of guessed on half a can of beer. I added in 3 strips of bacon, an extra clove of garlic and some red pepper flakes, I toned down the brown sugar a tiny bit, but other than that, I left it as is. It had a nice mix of spicy and sweet.

This is my go to chili recipe. * I use half of the sugar- way too sweet as is. I like to tweak it with more cumin and chili powder. Delish!!

This is the best chili I have ever had!!!!! My Husband loved it also. I plan on making this over and over... I was reserved about the ingrediants, However I followed it to the letter and the blend of the flavors is quite remarkable.

Iv made this recipe for years now and love it.... I have modified it a little. If you are like me  the original recipe it  sometimes a little too sweet and taste a hell of a lot better  the next day... my only thing is i like to eat the chili the same day i cook it....so here is what i did to make if great from day one!!!  1. I cut out the brown sugar... I found that if you cut out the brown sugar and just use regular sweetened coco powder it provides just enough sweet with the hott. 2. Instead if the beef broth try and use beef bouillon cubes  it really gives the chili a better overall taste. 3. This part isn't for everyone but for me I'm not crazy about beans so I sometimes  cut them out all together and cube up some potatoes..... to tell you the truth all my friends say the chili taste better when i use the potatoes.      I hope this helped at least one person!

I have made this twice already and I'm making a double batch for our Super Bowl party this weekend! Excellent chili...but a bit sweet with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, so I only use a table spoon or so! Since I'm not a bean lover I only use a can or two of beans instead of the 4 cans it calls for and I also add an extra can of diced tomaotes with green chili's! YUM

This was a really good, basic chili. Not very spicy, but it still had great flavor. I used ground chicken instead of the ground beef. I also put it in the slow cooker and let it cook overnight. My only advice if you are using the slow cooker is to not add the beans until the last hour. I added 2 cans at the beginning and 2 at the end. The beans that were added first were kind of soft. Made this for a small get together and almost all of it was gone afterward.

This chili was okay.  If I make it again, I will definitely leave out the sugar and will put in all the kidney beans at the start.  I didn't care for the texture of the kidney beans that weren't cooked for the entire time.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an additional can of tomatoes as my husband really likes them in his chili.  Consistency was good, but flavor was off a bit for my taste.

No doubt about it, this is the best chili I've ever had or made. My husband and I love it. It's very rich tasting, zingy without being so hot you can't taste it. It does not taste like Mexican chili, the flavors are very different. Sometimes I make it on the stove, other times after browning the meat and onions I put it in the slow cooker. Either way, it's completely delicious.

We thought it was fantastic. Definitely a keeper. Meatier than most with a dark, rich and smokey flavor. Will make this for family gatherings soon.

This is the one we've been using for the last six years. We use less sugar. We don't find coriander here in Taiwan. We substitute pork because beef is really expensive here, so really it's a pork chili I guess.

Excellent! I had my doubts based on the seemingly odd ingredients, but this recipe is a winner! The only midifications I made were to use two cans of diced tomatoes, cut the brown sugar in half and sub out 1/2 of the kidney beans for black beans. The chili was the best I've ever made and my husband is already looking forward to the leftovers.

We've been using this recipe for two years now. I give it four stars because we always cut the brown sugar at least by half if not further down and use one can of black beans, pinto beans, and dark red beans. Everyone always questions it at first, but after it's all stirred together they understand. Wonderful recipe.

OUTSTANDING!!! The combination of flavors in this chili makes it unlike any I've ever had. Doubled the recipe because there were about 10 people at my house to watch football and there was absolutely nothing left.

I have to say I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be given the other ratings/reviews. I am not sure if I will make it again, I have a different recipe I like much better. However, I definitely think the sugar would need to be cut back it seemed a little sweet. My husband liked it ok, but I just didn't enjoy the flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly. BF and I both thought it was pretty good and over the course of 3 days ate most of it. I froze the rest. This did taste a lot like my moms chili, which is good too but has fewer ingredients then this one. Will try another recipe next time but will keep this one on file just in case. I also wanted to note after reading some other reviews that I did not find this chili too sweet and did not taste the beer or chocolate. It was just a good basic chili.

I've just gotten back into cooking and found this recipe for chili.  It is by far the best chili I've ever put in my mouth.  My husband is finicky about his chili and he can't stop eating this stuff.  He even met me at lunch today and said if he didn't have that chili he didn't want anything...and this is coming from a man that NEVER eats left overs!!

This was great in my slowcooker. I used dried beans which I started the night before. I added homemade canned roasted tomatoes. The beer and chocolate were inspired ingredients. By far my favorite chili recipe. thank you so much for sharing!

Excellent chili.  I used two rather than four peppers (they were around 7" long), but otherwise followed the recipe.    Lots of ingredients, but easy to make.   Put half in the freezer for another day.

I decided to make this chili for the first time for my neighborhood chili cookoff and WON! We had 12 chilis in the contest including the chili from Wendys (to throw people off). Mine won and Wendy's was 2nd! This chili has just the right amount of sweet and spicy! EXCELLENT!

Truly great chili recipe.  This could almost be a "copy-cat" recipe for the Steak 'n Shake restaurant chili, which is highly regarded.  Just finished a bowl of this "Cincinnati Style" and it really took me back to my midwest/upper south roots.  I made one pre-emptive change, which is that combining hamburger with chopped steak basically is still just hamburger. I substituted 3/4 pounds of pork loin chops for the sirloin.  I chopped them finely in my food processor.  Another thing I do is once the meat/onion mixture is browned, I throw it back in the fp for another spin to really mince it finely and bring out all of the meat flavor (creates more surface to mass, basic chemistry).  When you combine beef and pork like this the meat sensation will really "pop" - try it in your pasties, shepard's pie, red sauces, etc.  Otherwise I went strictly by the book.  And what a good book it was.  This is a real keeper of a recipe and I can't wait to try it tomorrow after it's had time overnight to "gel."

Okay, I admit the list of ingredients left me skeptical but peaked my interest enough to try this.  When I first made this 2 years ago, my husband saw me adding beer, coffee, and chocolate and gave me a look like I had lost my mind.  But after taking his first bite, he was hooked!!  We make this several times each winter (Arizona is too hot to have this any other time) and each time the family loves it.  My family back in Mississippi heard me raving about it and asked me to make it when we went back "home" for Christmas.  I made it with deer instead of ground beef and they all were impressed with the outcome. I will look no further for a chili recipe...this is a keeper!!

I changed to 20 servings for a superbowl party- it was almost gone!  everyone loved it. Since I changed to 20 I did cut down on the onion and jalapeno peppers- I added 3 onions instead of 5 and 3 jalapenos instead of 10- came out great!

This is fantastic.  I made this for the first time today and I can't stop eating it!!  I don't normally like spicy food, but, the flavors in this chili are out of this world.  Everything goes together so well and makes for the best chili ever!  I will never make another chili recipe.  This is a keeper!!  Thanks so much!

Love this recipe!!! I did lay off the brown sugar though, instead of a half a cup, I put a tablespoon in. Also instead of cocoa powder,I broke up a little 4oz. bar of Hershey's extra dark chocolate!!! Perfect balance of sweet and heat!!! Great recipe, a keeper!!!!!

Won a Chili contest with this recipe ("Best Tasting") and never made chili before in my life. Used Sam Adams for the beer and Seattle's Best for the coffee. Marinated the steak for 24 hours with oil, salt and pepper. I live in Japan so chili peppers are hard to get so I used mini bell peppers instead. Also, after cooking the chili, I chilled overnight. Simply delicious.

Great chili recipe made even better with the helpful suggestions of others and my own secret additions.  I'm a seasoned cook who knows what I like and don't like, so admittingly I rarely if ever follow a recipe to the letter and from the raves I get, I'm obviously doing something right!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! We made it exactly as the recipe is written (that's the only way to know what to change the next time, after all!), and we were really happy with the turnout.  The only thing that I felt it lacked was acidity-it is rather sweet and mellow, with a kick in the afterburn, but I found that topping it with a little diced tomato, onion and a squeeze of lime gives just the right amount of acid and brings out the complexity of flavors even further!  To those who complain that it has a bitterness to it-taste your coffee before you add it to the pot. It could be your brew or the type of beans. We used Smithwicks beer-really nice flavor!  We will definitely be making this chili again....and again!

This was a winner.  A little sweet but great flavor.  The only change I made was to add 1 cup chopped green pepper.

I have made this chili a bunch of times and have modified the recipe very little.  I will double up on the sirloin and instead of cubing it I will rough chop it in my food processor (not so much that it is ground).  I will vary the beer (usually any dark beer I have on hand).  I add an additional can of diced tomatoes.  Beans will vary depending on what I want.  I will simmer 2 - 2.5 hours.  If I want a thicker chili I will add a cornstarch slurry (maybe one tablespoon in cold water) the last half-hour of simmering.  As many reviews have shown, this recipe lends itself to personal modification.  Every other chili I try is good, but it always seems to be missing something compared to this one.

We love this recipe - we've tweaked the ingredients a little (switched to light beer) and a tad more brown sugar and it's a hit.  Everyone just loves it!

I've been making this a while, and kept forgetting to rate it...  This is my favorite chili recipe, and I make it several times during the cold months.  I use different beans depending on what I'm in the mood for, and I use 2-4 jalapeno peppers depending on who will be eating... in-laws can't stand spicy.  This has a LOT of ingredients, but they all blend together nicely to make a dark, hearty, satisfying meal.  It's starting to get cold here, and people are already asking me when I will make "the chili" again!  One of the first things I saved in my recipe box, and I am so glad I did.

Absolutely the best!  This is the only chili I make.  I double the ground meat and omit the cubed sirloin.  Always forget the hot peppers but it is awesome anyway.  Made this at least a dozen time.

We LOVE this chili,although we cut the sugar for dietary reasons as well as taste, and I probably modified some others ways the last few times I've made it,but I do that to ALL recipes!! I admire anyone who publishes/shares a recipe! Great job!!

I made this chili almost exactly as it is written except I didn't have dark beer so I used light.  It was phenomenal!!!  Everyone was raving about it and asking me for the recipe.  It is worth all the time and ingredients!  You will not be sorry.

I haven't tasted it myself, but made it for Superbowl Sunday.  They were wiping the pot with bread to get the last bits.  Never having made chili before I followed the recipe as best I could.  Only used a couple of jalapenos but pretty much kept the rest.  I will make this again.

Wow, this turned out great!  I cooked this in a crockpot on low overnight for a "soup" potluck at my work today.  I made a couple of changes to it: I left out the beef broth completely (in the slow cooker it is not needed), used one large white onion, a little more sirloin, 3 teaspoons minced garlic, 2 Serrano chilies (one with seeds), half kidney - half pinto beans, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and everything else the same.  (So not too different).   I also used Guinness beer.   While the beef, onions & garlic were cooking I threw everything else into the crockpot to mix it up and then dumped in the meat.   It was the favorite "soup" of the day!  Next time I'll use three or four chilies to add a bit more heat and make sure sour cream is handy for people who need to tame it.  With two (and seeds) it had a slight after-burn but not enough for me.  :)  I had a bottle of habanero Tabasco sauce handy for anyone like me.

Fantastic chili.  The use of cocoa and coffee give it great complexity.  My only small suggestions.  Next time, I will cut back on the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I will also use a bit more spice.  Specifically, I will add a 1/2 tsp "Texas Gunpowder"  brand of dried jalepeno powder, and perhaps a generous sprinkle of chipotle chilis.  (I actually already did this on 1st batch as it didn't taste spicy enough for my families palate. 

In summary.  This chili rates 5 stars on two accounts.   1.  It tastes great  and 2.  It is easy to prepare, without a lot of chili voodoo.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Yuengling Black & Tan beer. I may add a little more heat or a little less sweet next time, but I'd also be satisfied if I made it again exactly the same way.
  
This is the first thing I have made in the last year of living with my boyfriend that he has actually liked enough to take the leftovers to work the next day!  I halved the recipe, but then I was jealous there weren't leftovers for me to take too!

Wow!!!!!  This chili is fantastic!!!!  I have been looking for a "good" chili recipe, and ecstatic to have found an amazing one.  My fiance' hadn't even taken more than two bites, and was exclaiming over the taste.  What's more, he took leftovers for lunch the next day, and said all his co-workers were drooling over the aroma that was coming from the microwave.  Thanks for a great recipe that is now in my "keeper" file.

This was very good chili with few modifications.  I only used dash of coco, 3tbs of sugar, 1 can of kidney, 1 can of black and 1 can of pinto beans.  Didn't put sirloin because not a big fan of red meat, left out cumin seeds (didn't have any) and used only 2 hot peppers.  We thought that was perfect as the heat.  So with THOSE CHANGES, it was 4 stars.

This my favorite chili recipe. I have made it for numerous parties and have yet to find someone who didn't like it. I now reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and used buffalo instead of beef. Other than that, this recipe is perfect just as written.

I have made this recipe a number of times.  It is great exactly as written but does really well with some changes too.  I generally substitute 2 can red beans for 2 of the kidneys and ease up on the jalapenos. Taste as you go so you can customize this to your liking.  This chili is not too spicey for me but for the in-laws, I have them dollop sour cream on top to soften the heat.  Thanks for recipe!

The sauce was perfect! A little bit of spice with a little bit of sweet. Very good!

OMG . . if you are looking for a chili recipe that doesn't take all day to cook, this is the one!  It is fabulous.  The only things I change is I add 2 cans of kidney beans and one can of black beans and only half a jalapeno.

Oh my Gosh can I say this is the best Chili I've ever had!   A girl from work brought it in and all I can think about is making this chili myself.  I just don't like beans so I will make it without beans.

My husband wont let me make any other chili. He begs and begs me to make this. So I make a gigantic batch and freeze it. That way I can  have some on hand when ever he gets that crazed "I need chili" look in his eye.

I'm not looking any further for a great chili recipe after finding this one.  Like others I decrease the brown sugar (I use 1/8 c); sometimes I add the jalapenos & sometimes not, depending on whom I'm serving.  It has an incredible complexity and depth of flavor.  My whole family loves it. It's definitely worth 5 stars in my humble opinion.

The amount of chili peppers and cayenne pepper worried me so I cut back to 1/4 the pepper.  The results were GREAT! Wonderful flavor.

Ive made this several times. Every time I have people begging me for the recipe or to make it again. I enjoy it because I can change the way I make it, and measuring isn't nessisary.. Only thing I change is brown sugar, just a little works. Otherwise it tends to be a little to sweet.

An excellent basic chili.  I took this camping and was a great meal by the campfire!  My only modifications were to omit the salt and 6 oz of tomato paste (to cut back on the sodium). As with all chilis, I try to make it a day before and serve the next day to allow the flavors to blend.

Followed the recipe exactly, loved it.  Guests loved it.  Will make this again...I love the complex flavor, yet it still tastes like good old chili.  Next time I will definitely halve the sugar, as others have suggested.  (I also made this with Homesteaders cornbread from this site...YUMMERS!!)

This was hardly edible after simmering for two hours...the beer taste was too strong and it was too sweet.  However, it tasted much better after sitting in the refrigerator for a day, so I gave it three stars.  However, even after the flavors had a chance to meld in the refrigerator, it was still just okay.  I've made much better chili for much less money and effort.  I won't be making this again.

yuck...too sweet for one thing...and just had a bizarre taste I thought.  I had to add an entire package of taco seasoning just to give this a little kick (and yes, that's even with 1 tsp of cayenne)

Absolutely THE best.  One word of advice. Cut the sugar in half--then proceed to taste. (You can always add more but you can't take away). I used 2 seeded jalepinos and diced red and green bell pepper.  YUM!!

This is an awesome chili!  It has a nice, rich flavor.  I wouldn't cut down on the sugar one bit.  The sweetness offsets the heat of the peppers perfectly.  I used two cans of kidney beans, a can of black beans, and a can of pinto beans.  I also left out the serloin.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as written, and it was fabulous.  For the peppers, I chose two anaheim peppers and two jalepenos.  This chili goes great with cornbread!

I thought that I was going to have a surefire hit on my hands with this one just from reading all of the great reviews, but I was pretty disappointed with this.  I don't eat chili but I made it for my superbowl party, and everyone who ate it either said that it was missing something or that it was "only ok".  It also never really thickened up at all, even after adding quite a bit of corn starch.  Not a bad recipe by any means, but I probably won't be making this again due to the expense and the lackluster reviews it got.  The only changes I made were to cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 1.25lbs of cubed sirloin, and I used two cans of beans (drained) instead of four.

My husband found this and so we tried it.. I have to say this is the best chili we have ever tasted. I used to think my mother's was the best but there is no comparison. The only change I made was 2 less cans of kidney beans and used 1/4 tsp of brown sugar...It is the best....

I took the advice of others and cut the brown sugar back to 1/4 C.  This chili has a very well-rounded flavour.  I made this for dinner one night for friends.  Everybody had seconds and by the end of the meal the crockpot was empty.

I've been making this chili recipe for over 20 years.  Over the years I've adjusted the recipe to how we like it but I still make this recipe pretty close to original recipe

I don't add beer to it and I normally leave out jalapenos since my husband doesn't like them. Yes, this is a sweeter chili but our family loves it. The cocoa powder is great in this - it can be adjusted depending on how sweet you like it. Same with the brown sugar. You don't have to add it in. (My daughter and her husband love this recipe without the sugar and they add in various peppers for the heat.) 

I've made this with a variety n of meats. I usually use chuck roast chopped into chunks but there are times I've also used various cuts of sirloin or steak cut into small chunks. Sometimes I only use ground beef. I've even used ground turkey. It's all good. 

I've won several office cook-off's using this recipe and everyone always says I make the best chili!

I made this chili recipe exactly as described, hadn't bothered to read the reviews prior though.  I was a bit concerned about the 1/2 cup of brown sugar but thought with all the other flavors it would mellow out the sugar.  Although this was very good, a bit too sweet for my taste.  I will make this again but perhaps only using 1/4 or maybe even no brown sugar.  I really enjoyed the taste of the steak, hadn't made chili before with anything other than ground beef but the steak was awesome.  Next time I will probably add more steak too.

This is an awesome chili recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and made it the night before.  It was quite delicious the next day.  I don't think I'll ever make another chili recipe again.  Absolutely the best I've ever had!

This is my new favorite chili recipe!  We used only 1/4 c. brown sugar.  For the peppers we used 2 jalapeno peppers and 2 habanero peppers (seeds removed).  The day we made the chili it turned out a little to spicy, but by the following day the flavors had mellowed and it had the perfect amount of heat.

I've never made chili before, but we had a neighborhood chili cook-off last weekend, and I used this recipe.  I won 1st place!  It has an unsual, complex flavor, but it IS very sweet.  Based on other reviews, I cut the brown sugar by half, but I think I could have done away with it entirely.

Well, I have been simmering this chili for the last 2 hours and read previous reviews not to taste or eat it until the next day.  I beg to differ!  It's fanstastic - and it was an hour into the cooking process.  Can't say enough about this recipe.  Changes I made were 2 cans of beans (red kidney and chili) and additional pound of hot italian sausage.  Lost the cayenne pepper on the way from the grocery store but think it is definitely spicy enough with the hot italian sausage added.  Oh yeah, the jalapenos I used were HUGE, so I used two.

May just have found our favorite chili recipe.  I did tweak it a bit..I used a pound of hot Jimmy Dean instead of steak and added chopped onion.  I eliminated cocoa because I did not have any. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again, if not always.

Yeah, I'll back the peeps on this one. Bob has come up with something different here. However, as in most chili recipes, it always better the NEXT DAY. So, make ahead and let the flavours develop overnight. Serve with moist cornbread and lots of chili toppings. All good.

Fantastic chili. I make this every year for our annual Halloween party of over 150 people! Everyone loves it. I serve it with chopped onions & shredded cheddar. I also use all premium ground beef.

The complexity of flavors with the coffee, beer and cocoa is wonderful and rich.  I added some chipotle peppers since I didn't have any fresh hot peppers also only added 1/4 cup brown sugar (per other reviewers comments) and it tastes perfect for us.

The best! I've tried about 6 different recipes for chili and used the little packets (gasp!), but this is hands down the best.  My family likes a little less heat so used 2 chilis instead of 4.  Also, I agree with previous reviewers about the brown sugar; next time I'll cut it down to about 1/4 cup. I used 2 cans of pinto beans and 2 cans of kidney beans. . .loved it. Thanks!

This has been my chili  recipe for about 4 years now. I use guiness usually unless I can find Double Chocolate Stout, which rocks. I follow pretty much to suit with the recipe, but we use bison instead of beef. It gives it a more beefy flavor without the fatty beef taste. Sometimes I will add masa to thicken it up because it gets a little soupy. Serve with cornbread and Fritos. My new husband has decided it is OUR recipe now, not just MINE.

Great chili recipe with a unique taste. I  used a Celebration Ale for the beer in the recipe and put sour cream and cheese on top when I served it. After cooking the meat and onions, I put all of it in my large crockpot and cooked it on low for 5 hours. Excellent!

Made to recipe as directed without modification...was okay, had a more complex and very sweet flavor than I would expect/like from a chili.  Tried the day after reheating, had a little more flavor, but still the same.  If I do make it again, will most certainly cut sugar/coca down 3/4 the amount, and also add a ton more jalape√±o peppers to spice it up.

This chili is amazing!  I don't keep beer in the house, but I used amaretto flavored coffee beans for the coffee.  Substituted the sirlion with a little pepperoni,  Excellent!   I'll make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so yummy.  I am a diabetic,  so I left out the beer,  and cut the brown sugar by 1/2,  and still the coffee and beef broth made this the best chili I've ever made.

This was an ingredient packed chili, that looked great. I just personally did not enjoy the flavor. I thought it had a strange taste. I feel the beer was a little overpowering.

Like many others, I was concerned about the ingredients; I do find that letting it simmer the full time is necessary.  Excellent, very thick and spicy.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was really good.  I tweaked the recipe a bit: I don't like beef so I substituted pork, I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cans of black beans, cut the tomato paste in half and added only one and a half tablespoons of sugar.  Next time I would cut back on the chili powders; my husband loved it but I was struggling a bit with the spice.  The sauce was lovely and thick, and the mix of flavors was terrific.  The whole house smelled good while it was cooking!

Excellent Chili!!! I used two pounds of hamburger instead of steak. Couldn't find red hot chile peppers, so I used jalapenos. This recipe has such great flavor without being too hot. My 3 year old ate this and loved it. Defenitely will make again.

This was a really great chili.  I used 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of the beef and a combo of black beans and kidney beans.  I used 2 chili peppers and 2 green peppers, as I was afraid of it being too spicy, but the chilis did not add as much heat as I would have thought, 4 would have been fine.  This was a big hit at a dinner party I had and I will be making this again!

Took this to the chili cook off last night.  Half of it disappeared and all our friends enjoyed, but no awards, darn it!  I must keep searching for the BEST chili recipe!!  By the way, we also cut the sugar in half, and reduced beans by 1/4.  Who won, you ask?  A white bean chicken chili (it got our vote too).

Love this recipe. I have made it as is. Super good but for my preference I cut down to 1 can of tomato paste and used 1/2 cup brown sugar. I love beans, so I use 4 cans but I could see how some would only use 2.

Having picky eaters, I was skeptical that this would be a hit in our house.  I shouldn't have worried.  It was a definate hit with the kids as well as at the cookout at work.  I did alter the spices a bit as my husband and kids don't like hot/spicy foods.  I also leave out the beans as they won't eat them and make it a meat only chili.  I've tried several different beers, and the one our family likes best is Killian Red.

My family LOVED this recipe...I left out the corriander and to stretch out the quanity I added an extra lb of ground beef *please BEWARE recipe does not call for draining the meat* I think it would have been too greasy if meat was not drained.  I am entering this recipe in a chili cook off at work.

Made as directed and served with choice of rice or pasta and shredded cheese for garnish.  All agreed it is the best chili
they'd ever tasted.  Only change from the recipe was to use
l can each small red beans, black beans, and kidney beans.
Wish I had doubled the recipe!

Truly a hit with the men, this chili recipe is much different than ones I have used in the past.  We all liked it alot.  I will try it next time in the crockpot since the chunks of sirloin were not as tender as I would have liked.  I rarely use fresh hot peppers so I loitered at the produce section hoping for someone to come along and show me which peppers were chile peppers!  Alas, no one came.  I checked out the canned peppers and found a jar that said "chile jalapeno peppers" so I went back to the produce section and grabbed the jalapeno's.  I was too scared to use 4 peppers; used 3 instead.  I need not have worried, it was not too hot and next time I will use four.  Great recipe!  Fun to make.

I was really sceptical about how this chili would taste but because of all the positive reviews I gave it a try. It really is fabulous. I used only a 1/4 cup of brown sugar (as several other reviewers suggested). It was just right. Used Guinness and Seattle's Best Post Alley blend coffee.

I just made this recipe (kind of) for a family reunion (of extremely non-adventurous eaters).  I had to make a few changes (less hot peppers, less chili powder & cayene pepper; ran out of kidney beans so I used more meat).  It was "hot" enough to satisfy the hearty, adventurous few without scaring off the meek!  All in all, a great crowd pleaser.  Do let it cook longer than the recipe calls for.  I cooked mine for 2 hours, put it in the fridge overnight then reheated it in the morning before putting it in a crockpot on low for the duration of the picnic (or until it ran out!).  Now I wish I made extra so we'd have leftovers.  Even my extremely fussy husband liked this one! ****UPDATE**** I made this chili for a company sponsored luncheon and made enough for 80 people (I don't recommend doing that unless you have the proper pans, though!) and still have people clamoring for me to make it again!

We have made this chili at least ten times in my house, and every time everyone enjoys it.  The only way, however, to get my children to eat it is by spooning it over elbow macaroni and adding cheddar and sour cream, they call it "chili mac" and they love it!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Will make again and again!

Made this without the beer (did not have any). It tasted wonderful. I decided to put a shot of Jack Daniel's in it afterwards, it was great. The booze enhanced the flavors. This recipe does not need beer or any alcohal to taste good though. It is the best chili recipe I have made. I make a great chili, but this is better!

Awesome!  --NO BEAN VARIATION!!--
I am religious about having no beans in my chili.  If you fall in the same camp, here is a terrific adjustment:
Substitute 1.5 lbs of ground Buffalo or other lean ground meat and brown with the other ingredients in Step 1.  Triple the garlic to 9 cloves.  Instead of beans , FINELY CHOP (food processor works best) 8 husked tomatillos and add when the recipe calls for kidney beans.  To adjust the sweetness, use only 1/4 cup brown sugar and two teaspoons of honey!! The best beer for flavor if you can find it is Shiner Bock. For the chile peppers, I used 1 cup of sliced jalepenos.  Slow cooked, or even pressure cooked, this is a champion quality chili.

YUM! I followed this recipe exactly and it's fantastic. Not too hot either. Don't leave out the cocoa and coffee, it makes a huge difference, even though it's a subtle flavor.

I made this recipe for two days in a row. The first time, I did exactly as the recipe instructed, but no coriander because i didn't have it. It came out great and soon got a request for a repeat. Next day i made it again but used all ground beef and left it to cook in the crock pot after browning, making sure to check every now and then. I also reduced the sugar to half and doubled the oregano, to tweak to my taste. It came out fantastic, even better than the first time I made it, I think. Nowadays, I am known to be this gal who makes fabulous chili, which has gotten to be quite popular at potlucks. Thanks, Bob, for this wonderful recipe!

Super easy...I prefer to use all ground beef (because it's the way I like chili).  I also cut the amount of brown sugar in half. It's not hot enough for me so I put in double the cayenne as well as the jalapenos. You could even try tobasco because it would give it a little  extra flavor because there is something missing flavor wise.  That being said it's very simple, very fool proof.  For my taste it's not the best chili I have ever tasted, but EVERYONE loves it!  You can't
 go wrong.

Holy cow this was supreme!!! I used only beef sirloin and did not include the cayenne pepper or fresh chili peppers as I was going to feed to my 2 and 4 year olds...I also topped it with a dollop of sour cream (for the kids benefit), shallots and cheese.  I didn't cook it as long as I would have liked, to really get the meat tender - but the bowls were all but licked clean and my husband went looking for more. Even my 4 year old, who is VERY fussy asked if there was more! I actually came back here to copy the recipe for a friend...just fantastic!

I cut this recipe in half because I wasn't sure what I was getting into.  Wow! Should've made the whole thing. Three in my family and we were scrapping the bottom of the pan.  It has an unusual taste for chili but it really was yummy. I did add a bit of hickory salt and comparatively everyone liked that even better.  Next time I might cut down on the sugar a bit.  Will make again.

I was a bit doubtful of the coffee and the beer, but I did as other members said, and I used a can of Guinness.  I also did not want to add the sugar, as I really don't like sweet meat sauces.  But I ended up adding the sugar as it was bitter without.  I thought the chili was just "okay" the first night, but tried it again for lunch the next day.  It was WAY better the next day, and was very good!!  I will make it again, but will only serve it after it has had a chance to sit for a day.

Excellent, with very complex flavors, due to the coffee, dark beer (I used Guiness), brown sugar and chocolate, all which shown through even more because I prepared it a day in advance. Not too tomatoe-y, which I liked. The combo of ground beef and cubed sirloin gave it more interest and texture as well. My advice? Prepare it the day before so all the flavors (liquid & spices) can develop more.  I did sear off the cubed sirloin at a high temp separately as well, and it tenderized nicely after the slow 1 1/2 hr. simmer. I also only used 2 cans of beans (the kidney beans I used were big) and that seemed like more than enough. Sweet...spicy...earthy...all in one! Maybe the best I've ever had. No need for thickeners which can make some chilis "gummy". Served w/Best Ever Corn Muffins from allrecipes.com, a salad, and cold beer. A winner, and worth the effort!

This is now our staple chili recipe.  I find that the amount of sugar to add depends a lot on the kind of beer you use.  I suggest waiting to add the sugar until the end and then adding to taste.

I made this exactly as listed with only two exceptions-- I used ground cumin instead of seeds, and I cooked up the meat and onions in a separate pan before adding it to the pot so that it would be easier to drain the grease. The peppers I chose were Anaheim, and I used Guinness for the beer, which I think made a difference. This was so tasty, and I think it benefits from very close following of the ingredients, as well as using quality ingredients. You hardly taste the individual cocoa powder, beer and coffee-- it all blends together as a sauce so well. I will definitely make this again.

It was the best I ever had and I am not a big chili fan. I followed the recipe exactly, except slow cooked it for several hours and used no salt ingredients and didn't add any add'l salt.  People can add their own to taste.   Next time, I would reduce the amount of sugar or eliminate it and use 5 chili peppers instead of 4.  I would probably use all beef sirloin or replace ground beef with gorund turkey.

This recipe is definately a keeper, the flavor is exquisite....I used all the ingredients exactly as listed, except I substituted ground moose for the ground beef and sirloin and used Guinness Beer.  Oh, what flavor! My hat goes off the the creator of this fine recipe.

followed this recipe to the T. Made with a Bass Ale.  Turned out very good. Only suggestion would be to dump the ground beef, use 2 punds cubed sirloin.  Cut the suger in half, and kick up the heat a little.  Happy Cooking!

Fantastic!  I omitted the sugar entirely based on other reviewers comments, and left the seeds and ribs on the peppers (I used jalapenos), and it came out perfectly.  I recommend using Negro Modelo beer, which is a dark mexican beer.  If it's not quite hot enough for your taste, a few drops of habenero hot sauce helps.

Being from Texas, this just wasn't at all what I'm used to chili tasting like.  It was WAY too sweet!  I would just leave out the brown sugar all together.  It was also VERY labor intensive for the result.  I served 10 people and not a one raved about this recipe...think they were being polite.  Sorry, Bob-just not my taste in chili!

This was a pretty good chili and I would probably make it again but omit at least one can of the beans as it seemed to thin out the chili and cut the spicy flavor we look forward to in our chili.

This is a fun chili to try, though I probably won't make it again.  It was a very good recipe for a sweeter chili, for which I generally don't care.  But the flavors were really interesting.  It tastes best now, after being refrigerated for two nights.  I can see why some say it's similar to barbecue, but it's not exactly like that.  You should expect sweet chili with some hotness from the peppers, and unexpected mixtures of tastes.

This recipe was great!  I did modify to make in the slow cooker, and it really came out wonderfully.  Instead of the 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes in puree, and kept most of the other ingredients and liquid amounts the same.  I did use 3 lbs of lean stew meat, increased the amount of onions and garlic and spices (except cayenne which I kept at 1 tsp and sugar at 1/2 c.), and used Demara sugar instead of brown sugar since that is what I had on hand.  I browned the beef with onions and garlic, and then added everything (minus hot peppers - my family likes mild food) in the crock pot.  After 8.5 hours on low it was great!  Today I had left overs, and it was even better.  Next time I may cut down a little bit on the sugar and cayenne, but I thought the heat level was just right.

I made this Chili for a Super Bowl party, and everyone loved it!  I used all cubed beef and no ground (just a personal preference) and added more Cayenne for an extra kick.  This is now my standard chili recipe!

As I was monitoring the development of this chili, I was extremely skeptical.  All the ingredients (beer, coffe, cocoa, sugar) dominated the flavor following their individual addition.  Yet, the final product is irresistible!  I'm a personal chef, and made this for a few of my clients... a big hit!

I must say that I was quite skeptical about this recipe when I read the ingredients, but with all of the positive reviews, I had to try it!  I made it tonight for dinner, only using 1/4 cup brown sugar as others suggested and substituting a can of pinto beans for a can of kidneys.  I omited the peppers, because I am feeding a small child, but found the flavor to be WONDERFUL!  This will definitely be my new chili recipe.  I used a black and tan beer, in which the flavor was detectable, but I love beer and loved this chili!  I added some hot sauce to my bowl, as it wasn't spicy enough for me (probably since I omitted the peppers), a dollop of sour cream and the Tortilla Gold chips.  YUM YUM!  Recommended, for sure!  P.S.  My 3 year old loved it too!

After reading lots of the reviews on this recipe, I decided that I had to try it.  5 STARS to Bob for this recipe!  This was the best chili that I've ever made.  Even my husband raved about it. I even made a neighbor try it after they turned thier nose up when I told them about the beer, coffee & cocoa.  Needless to say I had to print them a copy of this recipe too. I used 3 Habenaro peppers and only 1 can of kidney beans because my husband doesn't care for them. I also made this a day ahead of time, because everyone knows chili tastes better the second day.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!

I've tried this chili twice because of all the rave reviews it received.  I don't think I'll be trying it a third time.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar the second time and still it was waaaay too sweet.  I had to put some salsa in it so the vinegar would offset the sweetness.  Also, be sure to use dark beer as specified--I made the mistake of using a Guiness the first time--too strong!  Next time I make chili, I'll go with the regular "red" kind.

Very good. I cooked 5 hours in the slow cooker on low the night before, then reheated in the slow cooker for 3 hours on low the next day. You could slightly detect the beer flavor, but overall had excellent flavor. I used 1 jalapeno pepper instead of the 4 hot peppers recommended. Flavorful, but not hot. 3 cans of kidney beans seemed perfect. Awesome texture/thickness. Also used 1/4 cup brown sugar based on other reviews.

This is a great recipe except for one thing: not enough beef! I will make it again but I'll double the beef. I'll probably also add about a quarter to half teaspoon of Dave's Insanity Sauce to give it a little more bite. Bottom line, if you want a serious pot of chili this recipe is a grand place to start! The combination of ingredients is supurb. I gave a couple of quarts to my sister and haven't heard her response yet, but I'm sure she'll say it needs more peppers. But recipes are made to be tweaked; more beef, more peppers (or pepper sauce), and this will be excellent stuff!

This chili fast became a favorite in our house. I agree that this is best after sitting overnight so I usually make it the day before I want to serve it. No matter how big a batch I make so there are leftovers for the week they are gone in a couple days. I often substitue a can of green chilis for dicing up hot peppers myself and it works fine. I don't like beer but you can't taste it in theis chili and it is not as good without it. DO NOT try in slow cooker if you don't like beer taste as it had strong beer flavor when I tired it.

This was pretty good. I could stand for it being a bit hotter, so next time I'll add some more red pepper.

I made two changes, one out of necessity and one out of desire. I love green peppers in my chili, so I added two green bell peppers, chopped. The other change is that I used sweetened cocoa mix instead of unsweetened cocoa (since I had none of the latter) and to cut back on the sweetness overall I cut the sugar in half.

This is another recipie which tastes better a day later.

I have to say this worked out really well.  The only thing I did a little different was add 1.5 small, chopped Jalepeno peppers - this gave it a nice little zing that added a lot - I find most Chilis end up tasting like modified spaghetti sauce - this was not - also let it simmer to thicken up - other than that kudo's very good.

I made this chili for my daughter's first birthday party and it was a big hit. I did alter the recipie a little though. I knew a lot of people were not big spicy people so I cut down on the cayenne pepper and other peppers. I didn't add the beer either. I only added 2 cans of beans. It was great. I will make it again for the cold winter days ahead.

Wow!  This was my first experience preparing chili from scratch, and this turned out as good as the previous reviews indicated!  I did leave out the cayenne and hot peppers since my family doesn't like food quite that spicy, and the spice level was perfect for us-- my daughter really enjoyed it.  I also used only 2 cans of black beans because my husband isn't a big fan of beans.  Only other substitution was a package of "stew beef" instead of the sirloin, which added great beef texture and flavor at a lower price.  Even better the next day!

The chili was fabulous!!!  I noticed that several people commented on the expense of the spices--you can get wonderful spices REALLY cheap at an Indian store or any ethnic store.  You can also buy the spices whole at the Indian store and grind them yourself.  Toast the cumin seed in a dry frypan until lightly browned and put them in a pepper mill and crush when needed--adds great flavor to any dish it calls for.

I decided to try this recipe for myself.  It seems everyone has an opinion on it, how to make it work for them, how to improve it, etc.  I decided to make it exactly as it was stated, except lessening the heat by using only two peppers.  The coffee was provided by my neighbor since I am not a coffee drinker.  I'm not a beer drinker, either, but I visited the local liquor store.  The owner chose a dark beer from right here in Wisconsin for me to use.  The results of this chili were FANTASTIC!  I made it for a chili party.  I arrived later than planned.  Most of the guests had already eaten but when I left two hours later, my crockpot was nearly empty!  Thankfully, I had saved some at home to eat the next day and to share with my neighbors.  Thank you, Bob, for sharing such a unique recipe.  I'll be making this chili often during the coming winter months.

Awesome chili! Very thick and hearty, very tasty. Since my kids would be eating this, I cut back on the chili powder and cayenne, and didn't add the peppers. It was a bit sweet, but figured it was because I omitted a lot of the heat. I'll play with those ingredients next time. It does smell a bit weird for a while when cooking (i could smell and taste the beer), but the flavors do come together beautifully when it's done. It was even better the next night!

After all the hype from the last several hundred reviews, I have to admit this chili was disappointing.  It wasn't bad...just not the "knock your socks off" fabulous concoction I thought it would be.  I followed the recipe exactly and it's O.K., but I'll stick to my usual season and taste as I go method of making chili.  I probably rated it only 3 stars not because it wasn't good, but because I was so let down!

Absolutely the BEST chili I've ever made, and keeps very well. Lots of depth and flavors to it. I used a very, very dark beer, and Dutch processed cocoa and loved the flavour.

Like others, I had my doubts about this recipe.  I had 1 1/2 lb of sirloin I wanted to use in something, so after an ingredient search, found this chili.  I fixed it tonight (using the 1 1/2 lb), and everyone (husband, 2 early-20's sons) loved it.  I cut back the chili powder to 2 Tbl, beans to 1 can of pintos (not big bean fans), cayenne to 1/2 tsp, and 2 jalapeno chilis.  I only had ground cumin, so I substituted 1 tsp of that for the 1 Tbl cumin seeds.  I used a slotted spoon to scoop it out in bowls, then we each make our own burrito with a warm flour tortilla and some grated cheese, rolled them up and went to town.  Oh yes, I got a late start so it only simmered 1/2 hour, but it was still intense, thick and good.  After reading other reviews, I'm looking forward to having it tomorrow for leftovers.  I guess I'll have to retire my old chili recipe that I've been making for some 20 years.  This one is much better.  Bob, you're a great chilihead!

This has got to be the best chili recipe ever!  My hubby just loved it...he brought some to work and his boss ate two bowlfuls!  I have subsequently emailed him the recipe to avoid him bugging hubby about me making more, LOL!  Our local grocery didn't have any sirloin so we just used 2 lbs. of lean ground beef.  Fantastic with garlic bread for dipping.  Wasn't as hot as we like it, so will add more chili peppers next time.  Cheers!

Followed the recipe exactly, except used stew meat rather than sirloin. Best Chili I have ever tasted. My family agrees. Next time, I will brown the meat first, remove from the pan and cook the onion. Then return the meat and complete the recipe.

This really is what I consider the mother of all chili recipes. I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested you make the recipe exactly as stated once, and go from there. Do NOT omit the 'exotic' ingredients like coffee and cocoa and beer as they are key to the balance of different flavors that come out after the chili has had a chance to blend in the fridge around 24 hours. Don't decide that because you don't like beer, you won't add it. In the chili it won't taste like beer. Here is the final recipe for me---I like things medium spicy. I make everything exactly as is, with the following exceptions: 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 TBSPS chili powder, 3/4 tsp cayenne, 2 or 3 hot chili peppers (Anaheim and Serrano). This gives me just the right balance of sweetness and heat while not overpowering the other flavors, and has been a hit with friends and family. And do use the sirloin cubes; it really adds to the texture and final result.

By far the best I've ever tasted/made! Only I cut the brown sugar in half, used Amber Bock as my beer of choice and added Jalapinto beans (Trappey's) for a touch more kick. Delicious. The main reason I continue to search for recipes at this site! Thanks.
A favorite amoung friends who think I'm a genius.

Believe the hype, this is a great recipe!  For the most part, I prepared it as is, however ended up using only 3 red chile peppers as one of the peppers that I had cut into had gone bad.  I also used just a tad less cayenne pepper as was making it for a party we were having and not everyone likes their chili hot.  That said, it was really rather mild, so next time, I'll definetly be sure to use 4 peppers and all of the cayenne.  And regarding the sugar, I tend to like my chili sweet so found that part to be ok. This was a big hit that has now become our  house recipe for chili!

This is now my favorite chili recipe. The whole family loved it, served with hot corn bread. I don't know why anyone would say they could taste the beer and coffee, unless they didn't follow the recipe. I made it in the crock pot, with all ground beef. Next time I think I will try it with chicken. Delicious!

This chili was awesome!  I submitted it in a chili cook-off this past Saturday and I won first place.  I'm not sure why people have had a problem with it tasting like the beer & coffee, but it didn't at all!!  It might have something to do with them not following the recipe completely or maybe not cooking it long enough.  Excellent recipe, Bob!!!

Absolutely the best chili ever!  Every time I make this it is a hit and doesn't last through the 2nd day.  My husband and kidney beans don't necessarily mix well, so we reduce the beans by half, but make up for it by adding extra hamburger and sirloin.  I have recently started reducing all the liquids by just a little so the chili will have a thicker consistency. I love the sweet and spicey.  This is awesome!  Thanks Bob!

This was a really unique and surprisingly tasty chili.  I was nervous when I saw the ingredient list, but like everyone commmented, it all comes togetether well and really does tastes better the next day.  The only thing I did different, is I added more cayenne, chili peppers and sirloin than the recipe asked for and I didn't think it was at all too sweet.  We added shredded monterey jack cheese, oyster crackers and a dollop of sour cream to top it off.  Great recipe!

Whatever possessed you to put coffee in chili?  I must admit that scared me a little even though I love coffee ;)  But this is one terrific and unusual chili.  I could take it even more spicy.  I did take others' advice and added the brown sugar to taste.  About half of what was called for was plenty sweet for me.  Hubby would die if he knew he ate (and LOVED) something with coffee in it.  I will make this again and again.

hhmmm...the chili was very good, very different. The unusual ingredients blended well, but it was very sweet though, to the point that it was too distracting...  I  highly recommend slowly adding sugar to taste. Then this would be a five-star.

WOW! I was a little nervous about making chili with these ingredients, but it was so worth the risk! You wont believe how much flavor it has. I dont usually eat "Hot" dishes so I used two chili peppers instead of four. It still had a kick to it. Everyone that tasted it was floored!I gave some to my inlaws and earned some serious brownie points!

This chili is wonderful! Even though it may look like alot of unusual ingredients, the flavors meld together so well. This is a keeper! The chili does taste better the next day. So from now on I'll make it a day in advance. The only change I'm going to make to this recipe is, I'll add more ground beef and omit the sirloin. My kids were not fond of the chunks of meat. But they're not meat lovers anyway. Bob, Thanks so much for this great recipe.

Bob, this is an incredible chili.  I made it exactly as your recipe stated and wouldn't change a thing.  My dh about fell off his chair because it was SO good.  Up until now he was the self-proclaimed chili king and he has humbly turned over his crown to you! ;-P  I promptly went out the next day and bought triple the ingredients and cooked up and froze several more batches (is this ever good when it defrosts! Wow!)  Thanks for sharing this!

The ingredients are rather strange but I love chili so I gave it a try. I also figured that if I were going to rate this and be accurate recipe shouldn't be modified, otherwise you would not be rating the recipe. Not sure why users do that.

Anyway, it turned out to be a decent recipe and it is better a day later. Others liked it and I give it an above average rating. Not sure if I will cook it again since I like chile with a variety of fresh peppers for the heat instead of chili powder.

WOW! This is the BEST Chili I've ever tasted.I doubled the recipe and took to a small snow festival attended by about 45 people. Rave reveiws from everyone and they all wanted the recipe.  I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar because other reviewers mentioned the sweetness. The combination of ingredients was wonderful. I made it one day and served it the next.

I'll start by saying my husband loved this chili, although it did not win in a work chili cook-off.
I followed the recipe exactly except that I used light beer, 1/8 cup brown sugar, and left out hot chili peppers.  I cooked it the night before, put in the fridge, and reheated in the crock pot the next day.  I think the flavors melded together even more over night.  Comments from co-workers were that it had a unique and interesting flavor.  Some could taste the beer, although I did not.  It had a subtle spice, but it wasn't spicy.  Next time I would add the chiles, and use all ground beef.

My daughter tought the chili was a little bit good (which is an excellent review for her) and my husband was so delighted to finally eat REAL chili. However I have cut back on the spices. I only used 1 teaspoon of chili powder with one and a half hot chili pepper that I removed half through cooking. I also put more garlic than suggested.

Ok...this is good stuff!  The recipe is also very fogiving.  First off...I didn't have dark beer.  The 7-11 I stopped at didn't have any in the single cans/bottles and since I'm not a beer drinker I didn't want a 6 pack.  I bought a Miller Genuine Draft.  I also bought a cup of Dark French Roast coffee while I was there!  Whoever stated in their review that the coffee and beer flavors came through must not have cooked it long enough.  I do not drink beer OR coffee, but found no hint of their individual flavors. 

As many other reviewers...I used all ground beef.
I didn't want to bother with peppers, so used Rotel with chilies.  I also had only 1 can of tomato paste, so I threw in a 2nd can of Rotel.

I cut the chili powder and cumin amounts slightly and only used about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also had to leave out the beans, since my boyfriend won't eat them.  I heated some seperately in a small pan and added them to my bowl. The resulting chili was just marvelous, even with changes!

This was a huge hit at our Super Bowl party!  Hope you like it!  We totally doubted the ingredients, but it worked great!  We used Guiness, but will use Foster's or Killian's next time for a slightly mellower flavor.  We only used one hot pepper and it was perfect for those who like flavor but don't like flaming spicy food.  It is a definite repeat!!!

This was the best chili my husband had ever had. We did not use the fresh chili peppers and it was on the spicy side. We also cut the kidney beans in half and used chili beans. I will hold on to this recipe for sure!!!!!!

I was very nervous making this chili with the odd ingredients, but with all the reviews, I just had to give it a try.  It really did turn out well, but I wasn't as excited about it as many of the reviewers.  However, my husband thought it was the best chili he has ever tasted.  He said that usually chili is chili but this was just a little more unique and flavorful.  I will make it again and next time try it on guests.

I didn't care for this chili. To me, it had an odd taste. Maybe it was the coffee or the beer, or both??? My husband thought it was okay, but my two daughters did not care for it at all.

My husband and friends enjoyed this chili.  I halved the ground beef and mixed in ground Chorizo
sausage and also used the spicy chili beans.  Glad I made a double batch to freeze for the holidays.

Well, with 200 reviews, I don't suppose one more could hurt.  Let me tell you this, first of all.  I really don't like beer, and I did a double take when I saw that a whole can of dark beer was to be put in here.  Anyhow, I sucked up my inhibitions and followed this recipe to the last little detail, and let me tell you, it was worth EVERY shred of effort.  It's fantastic!  The taste isn't exactly like any chili I've had before, but it is a wonderful surprise.  For those of you who like a little spice, I would actually recommend adding a few *more* peppers - that, or the ones I used weren't that potent.  Regardless, try this recipe out, now!  Oh yeah, and I made it with ground chicken instead.  No problems there!  (Added note:  I tried it later with beef, exactly as specified, for a party, and I had many requests for the recipe!)

Very Good.  I didn't have beer coffee or cumin.  I also added bell peppers and beef base.  KI used Garbanzo beans because they are the only beans I like.  Wonderful and filling on a "chilli" California night.

I made this in a slow cooker, using a little less beer, broth, and coffee to adjust to the cooker, and it turned out pretty well.  I didn't tell my guinea pig family about the unusual ingredients, and they didn't notice any weird flavors, though I thought I could pick up on the coffee a little.  Overall, very tasty, and better on the second day.

My husband makes this Chili often in the winter.  Our kids love it!  We have also toned down the spices as needed for some friends who do not like spicy.  Great recipe that we have made and served to many friends and family!

i have made this recipe several times and even made a double batch one time and froze it.  i love it.  the sweetness balances out the heat from the hot peppers.  i like it pretty hot.  i have used different chilie peppers.  i liked them all except the jalapeno.  this recipe is quick to make after you get all the ingredients together.  a long simmer is not necessary.

This Chili is awesome!  Since I work during the day, I made this one night after dinner, so I could reheat the next night for dinner.  It tasted even better the next day!  For the dark beer I used Mississipi Black and Tan.  I also used 4 fresh diced jalapeno peppers instead of the cayenne.  I am definitly going to make this again, and again, and again.  My family LOVED IT!!!

This is great chili! It's actually the first homemade chili that I've been pleased with. My grandma who has eaten a lot of chili in her life said it was the best she has ever had and called me up to ask me who REALLY made it. I'm making a pot of it tonight to take to our Mother's Day barbeque on Sunday, it will go fast, everyone loves this chili. Thanks Robert, fabulous recipe!

I've made this 2 times now and I must admit that this is an amazing chili.  The first time I used half as much brown sugar and 1 can of pinto and 1 can of kidney beans.  Being from Texas, I thought it was still a little too sweet so the second time I used no brown sugar and the 2 cans of beans from above.  This recipie is definately going in my recipie box.

I found this to be the basis for a very good chili recipe.  I have made it twice now with my own changes,  I personnaly think that much chili powder is overkill and cut the amount in half.  I also added a whole habenero pepper to the pot for some great flavour.  For the beer I used Guiness stout, and I cut the sugar (brown) in half as well.  This chili has a well balanced flavour between spices.  Very good.

This was not good - it was too sweet even though I didn't add any sugar.

This chili recipe is fantastic!  I've never had such a flavorful chili.  The heat will depend on what kind of fresh chile you use.  I used jalapeno chiles and the heat was perfect.  Your mileage may vary.  Also, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup per the advice in other reviews.  I think it would have been too sweet otherwise.

This is a most superb recipe!  I heeded other reviewers' comments and cut down the sugar, and it was just right.  I also use stout instead of beer, and home-cooked black beans, and THEN the big secret!  Stick it in the crockpot to cook all day!  The flavours are full and complex, and the colour is amazing.  People go through vast amounts of this, and it's adaptable, too.  Purists can leave it as is, but it can be padded out with bell peppers and corn, or served on a nice fluffy mound of Arroz Blanco.

As unusual as it might look to put cocoa powder, coffee and beer into a chile recipe this was very good.  The only thing I might change next time would be to cut back a little on the brown sugar...... otherwise excellent recipe!

This was So Yummy! It is a very Hearty Chili! My kids devoured it. I used Newcastle Brown Ale. For the first 2 cans of beans I used Kidney beans, but for the last 2 I used Cannellini and Pinto,which gives it a nice color. I also only used 1 tbsp of brown sugar. This will become a regular weekend dish at my house!

This is so wonderful.  We don't like beans so we skip the beans and it is still full and hearty.  Thanks!

Excellent Chili!! The best chili I have ever tasted (don't tell my mom)!! I used 2 pounds of ground beef and excluded the sirloin. And I only used 2 cans of kidney beans plus 1 can of black beans. Instead of the chili peppers, I used Jalepenos, and the end result was fantastic. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was superb. Will definately use this as my standard for chili from now on.

This recipe was REALLY good.  My brother who doesnt eat beans ate the entire bowl without picking anything out.  I did, however use small white beans (habichuelas, by Goya) instead of the other beans.

This chili knocks mine off the list. It is possibly the best chili that I have ever eaten.

Best chili we have eaten in years...I agree about decreasing the sugar in half or more. I added 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder and 1 tbs minced garlic. Served it to company and had them all coming back for more!

This is the perfect chili recipe!  I am so GLAD that I did NOT alter the ingredients as some people have!   It was not at all too sweet...it was fantastic!  The best chili I have ever made and eaten.  I could live on this stuff!  I will keep all these ingredients on hand from now on because to change this recipe would be tampering with perfection! YUMMMMM!

I just made this for the second time, it is a family favorite of ours now. I ordered bread bowls from a bakery and served the chili in them hollowed out, I also made one batch hotter and after simmering in a crock pot they were both great. It is just as good (and cheaper) without the sirloin, and for the kids, I doubled the ground beef and eliminated the beans. I also chopped the onions and celery very fine in a chopper, so the kids wouldn't see them, but it still had the flavor. Very good recipe!

Kind of a pricey concoction to put together if you don't have all the ingredients on hand. I liked the overall product but recieved mixed reviews from others. I think next time I may cut back on the brown sugar a bit and also cut in half the dark beer and coffee added. Needs to be hotter! I'll be adding more hot peppers next time as well.

Very easy to make, especially as a beginner cook, although a little time consuming to measure out and mix the long list of ingredients. Delicious with a side of buttered bread!

Robert, I have to say that your chili recipe is delicious.  I made it for some friends and they all loved it.  They all took some leftovers for lunch the next day.  I served the chili with grated cheddar cheese, a scoop of sour cream and chopped green onions... yummy!  P.S. I also suggest that the recipe should use a little less brown sugar.

I was looking for a good chili recipe and came across this one.  My boyfriend and I both love it!  I don't like kidney beans so I used 2 or 3 cans of pinto beans instead and in place of the diced tomatoes substituted diced tomatoes with green chilies.  The flavor is fantastic.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  It was too sweet, which was the overriding taste to me. I would use much less sugar.  I would also use a more stout beer.

This was the best chili I have ever made.  I used a pound of ground buffalo, reduced the sugar to one fourth cup like so many others did and used one jalapeno pepper as I thought the chili powder and cayenne were enough for a spicy hot effect. I also only used 3 cans of kidney beans. I think this is one of those dishes that gets better after it sits for a night and you have it the next day. However, I think I ate a goodly amount as it was cooking. If you are a chili lover, definitely try this one.  Thanks Robert for a great recipe!

WOW!! I tested this on my husband, a good frined (who loves everything I make --but would tell if it wasn't) and my 2yr old daughter. My son refused to try it, but I'm working on him! I made it with 2 cans of beans, 1/2 the sugar and no cayenne (the chili powder I used was pretty spicy!).  I served it over corn chips and topped with cheese.  It was even better on day 3!  Next time I'll double the recipe and freeze half of it.  Do you have anymore great recipes Robert?

I loved this chili recipe. I was a little worried about the weird ingredients. It was my first time making chili. I will use this as an old faithful. I also used less brown sugar. But I will try more next time. I wasn't sweet at all.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow!  What a fabulous chili!  Believe me, I had my doubts especially with ingredients like beer, coffee, and unsweetened cocoa powder, but the end result was nothing short of AWESOME!!  My family loved it, especially my very picky husband who makes everything from scratch.  I search high and low for special recipes to share with my family and this was is definitely #1!

Great recipe, but a little sweet.  Next time I'll cut the brown suger to 1/4 cup, and use a regular, non dark beer.  I'll be making this one again.

This chili was awesome. I made it for a superbowl party - the guys could not get enough. It is excellent with chopped onions, cheddar, and sourcream!!

This had a fantastic overall flavor. I didn't have any dark beer, so I substituted it with coca-cola -- and it gave it a really nice aftertaste. I the added a few drops of Louisiana Hot Sauce to the recipe, which spiced up the sweetness.

Ok, you got me. The king of "this can't be that good" has to take a step back and admit, it is that good. Easily the best chili I've had in many years. I altered the spice a bit by only adding 2 chili peppers, and a teaspoon of honey, but I have to tell you, I really enjoyed this chili.

This recipe is excellent even without beans!!!  I have made this several times over the past two months in my crockpot.  We enjoy serving this chili over tortilla chips with lots of cheese, or in a bowl with corn bread.  I have deleted all other chili recipes from my database!

I was very disapointed in the turnout of this recipe. It had a very powerful spice flavor. If your not used to having dishes with these spices in them, leave them out!! I should have done this, and it probably would have been ok. Ive learned a lesson. Ill sitck to my old recipe. sorry

This is my all-time favorite chili recipe, and I get compliments every time I make it.  Something about the richness of the cocoa, beer and coffee plus a little sweetness just really works so well here.  I usually use extra meat, about 1.5lb ground beef and 1.5lb sirloin that I cut into cubes myself. I try to saut√© the beef and onions for a little while to tenderize the beef cubes. I also use 2-3 jalape√±os instead of the other peppers due to convenience.  I will add more or less cayenne based on the spiciness of the jalape√±os.  Love this recipe and make this chili several times per year!

Unique and tasty.   I used less than half the beer to mellow that flavor.  I put in spicy Thai red chilies by dicing up the pointy half of the chili along with the seeds, then putting the remaining chili in whole (sans seeds) as an extra challenge for those up to it.

Overall I liked this recipe.  the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a little bit sweet for my taste.  I omitted the beans as I live in Texas and don't want to be arrested.

This is the BEST chili I have ever had. I won 2 chili cook offs with this with just one change. I used UN drained mild chili beans. I will try roasted chili peppers next time just for fun. I threw out my old recipe of 40 yrs.

We make lots of chili during winter in the Midwest and this one always gets raving reviews from anyone who try‚Äôs mine.  I omit the chili peppers because I use various chili powders that have their own ‚Äúbite‚Äù.  We love spicy but I think it‚Äôs better to err on the safe side and add more spice at the end to your liking rather than chance making it too spicy and having it Be too much for the average person.

Perfect balance of sweet, savory and spicy.  Outstanding recipe!  The cocoa, the beer, the coffee and the brown sugar are spectacular combinations!

This chili is currently simmering on my stove and I just took a closer look at the recipe print-out to discover the date I printed it....February 2010! This chili has been part of my life longer than my daughter!!! It has become our traditional ‚Äúfamily‚Äù chili and we make it on New Year‚Äôs Day and during the Super Bowl every year. We are known among our friends and family for this delicious chili. I have other, easier, cheaper, weekday chili recipes, but truly, this is THE BEST. The combination of spices, bitter ingredients (coffee, beer, cocoa) and sweet (brown sugar, tomato paste) is perfect. The flavors simmer together so beautifully. We serve it with shredded cheddar and fresh cilantro.  Make this chili immediately. You won‚Äôt regret it!!!

I made this exactly to the recipe cutting the sugar a bit as most has recommended.  The flavor was OK and the addition of the chocolate/coffee/beer was nice.  However, it was so dense it was like eating clay.  It sat it sat in the stomach like lead and was not very enjoyable.  I may use the coffee/chocolate/beer triad again but in a different recipe.

I made this just as the recipe created. It is dark, rich and delicious! This isn't too spicy (I would add extra spice at mealtime), so those with a more sensitive palate would not be on fire. It has a wonderful, full-bodied flavor. We served with sour cream, fritos and cheese. AWESOME!

Love this chili recipe.  Been making this for several years. Easy with great flavor.  This is good option for people who are not crazy about a lot of tomato.  Can cut down the heat by using less spice and pepper without sacrificing flavor. The next day it really is at another level of goodness.

When making chili you MUST cook it, let it cool for a day, and re-heat.  If you don't, you're going to get an inferior dish.  A lot of people forget this.  This is a great recipe and If you follow it you will make great chili every time.  I reduced the amount of chili peppers, the recipe calls for 4.. that's very spicy.  I used 2 and it had a nice kick to it.  I thought it called for more salt, but that's a very subjective thing.

This is very good. In fact, it's the only chili my husband really likes. I add an extra pound of ground beef to make it meatier but it's not really necessary.

I like how dark and chiliesh this looks. I didn‚Äôt think it was too sweet and the addition of brown sugar took away the acidic taste of the tomatoes and the cocoa is a great addition to give it depth. I didn‚Äôt add the beer because I thought it would be too liquidy. I had to freeze this for a camping trip later on but it tasted good. I also used all tne spices but cut back on cayenne. I wasn‚Äôt sure that everyone likes it hot. I also had an envelope of chili seasoning I wanted to use up so that may add some heat to it. I think when I thaw this I‚Äôll add corn and maybe an extra can of beans to stretch it. UPDATE; I thawed and heated the chile in a slowcooker and it was really good. Served with fresh buns and the meal was 2 thumbs up.

I have been making this recipe for the last five or six years for parties and everyone loves it. I add extra hot peppers habaneros jalapenos basically any kind of hot pepper you got to spice it up a bit for those who like it really spicy.

I made this to the recipe except lessened the heat by a third. It‚Äôs far too sweet for my taste. The four cans of beans I initially thought was too much but in the end was exactly right.  I‚Äôll make this again. Next time with half the brown sugar, a little more meat and that third of heat.

Our favorite chili recipe! There is a food truck that visits our worksite and their chili is delicious. The cook told me two ingredients that was in the chili and I searched All Recipes to see what came up and this is the first one that was returned. When I saw the amount of reviews and the rating I decided I would try it. The food truck chili taste exactly like this with the exception being they don‚Äôt have any ground beef in it.This is exceptional and it is our favorite!

I doubled the recipe and otherwise tried to stay as true to it as what I had available. I did use ground pork instead of beef and used more diced tomatoes instead of paste, because I didn't have those items. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. The flavor was fabulous, but my only complaint is it was too sweet for my liking. It wasn't quite as thick as I'd like; though,  that was my fault, because of the lack of tomato paste. I'll definitely be making it again, but with about half the amount of sugar called for and with the tomato paste.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out super good.  I would have preferred that my peppers have a little more kick as this was  for the most part mild.  However, the flavor is outstanding and this is now my favorite recipe.  Highly recommended.

It‚Äôs just ok. It‚Äôs trying too hard. You don‚Äôt need the beer chocolate or coffee. The sirloin is unnecessary as well. Coriander was nice... I made this as directed and it‚Äôs a bit hot, and quite mediocre. There are much better recipes on here. Follow the better rated ones.

Freaking awesome! I left out the peppers, and just used ground meat because that was what I had on hand. 
I get praises all the time when I serve this!

I made this chili but altered it for my dad low sodium diet. Thus I cut the few high sodium ingredients by half and used ground chicken no beef. It it very good!

Really good!!! I did make a few modifications based on what I had though.  I used a can of Yuengling for the beer and 2 jalape√±os for the peppers. I did drain the meat before adding the spices and everything and only used one big can of chili beans instead of the 4 cans because I'm not a big bean fan. And followed some suggestions to only use 1/4 cup sugar but think a little more might be better next time. - it wasn't quite sweet enough the next day. I also used a tablespoon of espresso powder because I didn't have coffee.  My husband said it was better than his chili ;) Will definitely make again!

The coffee simply overpowered everything.  In order to fix it, I added the following:  4 oz. green chiles, 1 tsp. ground chipotle, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp. ground cumin, and 1 Tablespoon Cholula hot sauce (replacing 1/2 tsp. of the cayenne.  The amount of brown sugar made it too sweet.  I think 1/2 tsp. molasses would be an improvement.  The additions helped to correct the problems of (1) lack of cumin made it not even taste like chili (2) overwhelming coffee flavor.  I will be looking for a new recipe next time.

I was making this for friends so reduced the amount of chilli powder in recipe out of caution, but there really was no need as the flavour balance would have been able to accommodate the heat which I took away. Recipe is absolutely fantastic, all of it was eaten and bowls were actually licked, and there is no need to change a thing. To make this it required a little re-stocking of spices but so happy the recipe is so good as the second time I make it the dish will cost basically nothing to make and I know it will be requested. The addition of dark beer and coffee is incredible because it adds that depth to the flavour.

I‚Äôve made this several times, As written and with slight modifications. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and omitted the  chili peppers because it is extremely hot even without them . This is the only one that I make.

This is a very interesting recipe.  As with all chili recipes, modifications can be made for personal taste.  I used all stew beef for mine and made it in the crock pot.  Only 1 onion, which I cooked while I browned the meat, and then a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans (not 4 cans of beans).  The beans do need to be drained.  There's a lot of liquid there.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and used a nice Porter for the beer.  I also just used a large can of diced green chilies and only 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 2 Tbsp of chili powder.  We found the spice just fine that way.  Oddly, the flavors mesh.  Yes, it's sweet, but not in a bad way just a surprising way.

I have been making this for over 10 years now. It is fabulous. The longer you let it cook the better, the longer you let it cool the more flavorful it gets.

I half the brown sugar, it was too sweet when I did the whole amount.  I also put my in the crockpot on low for 4-6 hours.  Other than that I make it as is and my family loves it!  The chunks of sirloin are my husband‚Äôs favorite part.  It is a great recipe!

This was my first time cooking chili and it came out great. I made it as written except for the 4 chili peppers, I used 1 jalape√±o instead- I have some family members who won‚Äôt eat anything spicy hot.  I used Sam Adams Boston Lager for the beer.  This chili was nice and thick, with a good balance of sweet and spicy flavor, and no mouth burning heat.  The sirloin chunks were a nice addition- my husband immediately picked up on the fact this wasn‚Äôt just a usual all ground beef chili and remarked ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why this so good‚Äù.  I like that this has more flavor than many tomato tasting chili‚Äôs, and I like the sweetness- it sets this chili apart. I will definitely make this again.

Almost 3 years ago to the day, I found this recipe and it has become my all time go-to recipe for chili!! I make triple batches and freeze a lot and give some away to family. The peppers are the only thing I cut back on...too many kids tummies to spice it up too much! Oh and I cut back on the sugar as well! I hope everyone enjoys this as much as my family does!!

Delicious. Used 1# venison & 1# organic lean ground sirloin, as that‚Äôs what I had. OMG. What a wonderful chili & I don‚Äôt even like chili. Husband is a big fan. Topped with grated sharp white cheddar, dollop of sour cream & chopped scallions.

I loved it with the exception of one thing. I'd omit the brown sugar.  I agree that a little sugar offsets the strong tomato taste but I'm going to add just  a bit of white sugar next time.  I even cut the brown sugar in half and waited a day.. but no.  Too sweet.  Aside from that, the layers of flavor are awesome!   
Coffee, Chocolate, and beer.. who knew?  Use what you like.. they'll meld into something awesome!!  I used one Poblano and two Jalapeno peppers. And don't forget the coriander.  Spices are everything.

This has become on of my favorite chili recipes. I have yet to make it that someone doesn't ask for the recipe.  The only change that I make is to cut back on the sugar a bit, simply because I don't like sweet chili. It has a great flavor.

This is a great recipe!   I used all ground beef, but other than that, made as directed.  I wasn't sure what a "hot chili pepper" was, so I used jalapenos.  I had one very large one and I used about 3/4 of it.  I'll use more next time.  Hubby said it was hot enough, but I would have liked it a bit hotter.  We both agree that this recipe is a keeper!

This chili is so yummy!! I made a few changes. Only added 2 peppers & only used 2 TBL of Chili powder. I also added 3 TBL mixed with water of Masa tamale flour. It gave the chili a nice corn balance. 
I can see how it will taste even better tomorrow!!

Holy cow! I made this tonight and it is unbelievably amazing! I thought with a list of ingredients like that that it would either be inedible or incredibly delicious. Best chili ever! I followed the recipe but went with the suggestions of others to halve the brown sugar. I'll never make chili another way again.

I made this exactly as printed except for slightly more meat and light beer.  I live with the same wimps as another poster so I left out the cayenne.. I will put Franks Sauce on the side.  This is amazing!  I have other chili recipes I was pretty proud of, but this one tops them all!  Right now I am roasting some Anaheim peppers  to mix in, just because I had extra....

I have been making this recipe every fall for the past 10 years.  It is fantastic every time.  My husband loves the sirloin  chunks, and I love the richness added by the chocolate, coffee and beer.  This recipe won the family chili cookoff!

No real changes. You can add or subtract the amount of beans or the quantity or heat level of the fresh peppers, or slightly adjust garlic, but I wouldn't mess with the recipe beyond that.

Fantastic recipe. I've made this a lot, and it's one of my favorites. The first time I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Afterwards, I've enjoyed making a vegetarian version using button mushrooms chopped fine instead of ground beef, and thick cut portobellos instead of sirloin. I also sub 2 cans of black beans instead of all 4 kidney beans, which gives it a nice SW flavor. I like to use some home-made cold brew for the coffee, as it has a nice, smooth, sweet, low-acidity flavor compared to hot brewed coffee. Great recipe, one of our favorites!

Sublime. My go to Chili forever! I renamed it -- (playing on it's Irish slant with the Guinness.)  Prepared a crockpot of it for a work chili cook off.   Does not assault your senses, separate notes of the coca and coffee shine through. This recipe is the more sophisticated of the competitors I went against - weeks later,  coworkers were still telling me how much they loved it. They were expecting a red hot "Hormel can" type of Chili - pasty or "chalky."  Not this one.  I use a $17 dollar piece of Sirloin, Sirloin on the hamburger.  Last batch, for fun I added Beef Tips in addition.  They ate every last drop.  You can also pair this with a chilled Dark Beer or Stout, or a nice Cabernet Sauvignon.

Really good chili - sweet with a touch of heat.  I doubled the meat portions because I prefer a chunkier chili, but it would be delicious as listed.  Highly recommended!

Followed this recipe to a "T".  Absolutely the Worst Chili I've ever made.  Waste of time and money - no one liked it.  Way to sweet - questioned the brown sugar but put it in as called for - should have gone with my instinct.  Unless you LOVE sweet, don't bother with this one :(

It's a fair bit of work, but worth every second. The coffee, beer and chocolate additions and the other spices made it a flavour bomb.  I  made a couple of changes because of what I had on hand.  Since I didn't have any fresh chilis, I used a Tablespoon of chili flakes instead. I added 1 sweet and 1 spicy sausage and omitted the sirloin.  I also halved the sugar as per other reviews. Finally, I soaked one cup of white beans overnight and added them instead of the first 2 cans of kidney beans. An hour before serving, I added 1 can of kidney beans and one of black beans, again because I had those on hand. I served the chili with pumpkin cornbread and a green salad. This is the only chili recipe I think I'll ever use now. It was a big hit at a dinner for 6 -- so thanks for posting!

This chili was everything. It is on the sweeter side as people have said, but the flavor is so deep, that doesn't even matter. I cut down the beans by half, and did one can of kidney and one black, and to compensate I added ground turkey. I used one poblano and one jalape√±o and then used a can of mild green chiles and of hot green chiles (each 4oz). I would almost suggest using two cans of hot and skipping the mild though. I let mine sit overnight and served it the following day at chili cookoff where I competed with 10 other chilis in a traditional category and I won! Had only about a spoonful left in the pot when all was said and done.  It not only tasted amazing, but smelled and looked amazing as well. Definitely going to be hard to top!

This would be an amazing chili if it wasn't for the sugar. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone  in my household thought it was too sweet. I'll definitely make it again, but omit the sugar...maybe add a few TBLS.

I have a more traditional chili recipe that is really good but it's not sweet, so I wanted something that the kids might like with some sweet heat. They enjoy spicy food and eat Creole gumbo often.  We all enjoyed this recipe very much.  I soaked and cooked the kidney beans and finished the recipe in a croc.  I used an extra stout.  It's definitely sweet, which is a good departure from standard dry heat.

Delicious. Sauteed beef, drained and then saut√©ed onions, chilis and garlic. Added beef back in with spices to toast and then added liquids. Used instant coffee powder which I added with beef and then added a cup of water. Made with beer before but used wine this time. Excellent spicy, sweet and thick chili.

This is a delicious and unique recipe!  After reading quite a few of the reviews, decided to cut the beans and sugar in half.  Also did not have coriander seed so put quite a bit of cilantro which turned out quite nice!

Excellent rich flavor!  I used a little more brown sugar and skipped the oregano; I also used 2 lbs of ground beef since I didn't have steak.  Still awesome.  Will use this again for certain.

I just won the annual chili cook off at my work with this chili! 

Some minor tweaks - I used ground sirloin rather can cubed, and I increased the weight of meats. 1 1/2lb of ground beef and a full pound of the sirloin. Lowered the amount of brown sugar to 1/4cup, but it could have used an extra tablespoon, so I'll try it again that way. I also drained and rinsed all the beans, which I changed to 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cans of black beans. With the increase of meat, I also increased the salt by half a teaspoon. To decrease the heat because I work with some weenies I only used 3 jalepenos. 

I also made it a day ahead of time, stuck it in the fridge and heated it up in the crockpot the day of the cook off. Most of my amendments were from suggestions of fellow reviewers--including the original creator of the recipe. This is a great chili, I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to canned chili after this.

I made it exactly as written and did agree with the other reviews that it is better the next day.  The next time I make this (and I will), I'm going to cut the brown sugar in half to 1/4 cup.  If then it's not sweet enough, I will increase it to a  1/3 of a cup on my 3rd time making it until we get the desired sweetness.  We both loved it.  One thing I did change is the amount of jalapenos, I only used 3 instead of 4.

We don't do spicy, left out peppers and cut cayenne in 1/2. Good flavor, next time I make it I'm going to cut back on brown sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly. I did add a little bit of diced pork chop to the mix because I had a couple left over. I did take the suggestion of other cooks and made it one day and then we ate at the next and it was amazing. I will definitely make this again.

Great chili recipe!  I ended up tweaking it a little just because my family doesn't like really spicy food so I didn't put as much cayenne pepper and did not put any hot peppers in it.   What I substituted the peppers with is red and green bell peppers which still made it look like I put the hot peppers in but without the kick.  I did add more of the Guinness stout beer and a small amount of vinegar to cut the sweetness some.    Making it again tonight to go to a chili cook off tomorrow.  Just hoping I can recreate it the way I did the first time because it was wonderful!!

I made this with a few modifications.  No sugar at all.  Added a can of season Black Beans.  Added a bit of Smoked Side.  I also used hotter fresh peppers from the produce department.  I used half Olive oil instead of Vegetable.
It is delicious with a healthy kick.

This recipe is almost identical to a version I use in competition .
This is an excellent chili recipe, take an extra 10 minutes and do it like the recipe says.
Pretty much normal list of  ingredients by Texas standards, none too hard to find. Just like other reviewers say, people will not be able to tell what the special richness is, just bold and beefy.Only difference is I steep a few whole dried chilis, then puree them to add some depth. Also, if you are looking for some great chili powder options, look up Penderys of Fort Worth. More types of chili powder than you can believe, you'll find a good mix there. I drive there but you can order online

This chili recipe is amazing! Great flavors! The modifications I made were I used only 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 2 cans  and 2 cans pinto. I  also used a regular beer instead of dark because we don't like the taste of dark beer, though next time I will probably use one that's a little stronger. We just don't even like cooking with Guinness, its too overpowering. For the peppers I used two habanero and 2 jalape√±o. I cleaned them well so not too spicy. Loved this recipe.

I have been making this chili for a number of years. It's always a big hit! That being said, experience and personal preferences have caused me to make a few slight changes:

I like sweet things, but found that I preferred this recipe when using only 1/4 cup brown sugar.

I also found that 4 cans of beans was way too many for my liking! So I reduced the beans to two cans and also switched to black beans (drained) instead of kidney. I find they hold up longer and offer another layer of texture to the chili. 

For the beer, I usually use a good dark Stout (like Guiness), and I don't use coffee from my coffee-maker. I find making a very strong cup of instant coffee works just fine, plus it's easier to adjust the strength of the coffee.

I'm not a huge green pepper fan, so I usually use a red pepper.

I like it spicy, so I usually use 4 jalapeno peppers, finely chopped, but leave the seeds only in two of the peppers. 

These days I prefer to make this dish in a slow-cooker. Without a doubt, this wonderful chili tastes even better the next day and it is so worth it leaving it cook away in the slow-cooker!

I switched to 4 stars instead of 5, because I realized it doesn't make sense to give the original recipe 5 stars if, in fact, I found it preferable to make a number of modifications to the original recipe. So, to me, after my modifications, the 4-star chili became a 5-star chili.

It was unique and good.  If I use it again I would prefer less chili powder and less salt.

I actually made mine in my pressure cooker first for 30 minutes and then I left it on warm overnight. I made all of the ingredients just like the recipe said.  As another reviewer states, it's a lot better the next day after all the flavors come together!  I will warn though (and I do like spicy!) that with the four Serrano peppers it does have a slow burn after a bowl so I definitely might use two instead next time.  As for the flavor, with the coffee, Guiness, and brown sugar, it's perfect after it sits in the fridge for a bit. Awesome recipe with plenty of complex flavors.

Amazing! Loved how the flavors all came together so well. Let it sit, and it's even better the following day. I'm a little confused on how anyone could give this chili a low rating, because it was better than any chili I have tasted. Love the small kick at the end. My husband and I will be making this again, soon!

Best chili I've ever had! I have made this many times and now have friends calling me asking where to find this recipe.  I've made it as is a couple times and it is excellent. I have added a couple strips of bacon while browning the beef for some extra flavor on the last couple cooks which is awesome also

I used Chipotle peppers which gave it a much more smokier taste and I cut the brown sugar by half, aside from that this recipe is awesome. Another variation is to try it with Chorizo instead of the cubed sirloin.

This was as advertised a different, sweet take on Chili with the beer/coffee and the coca powder/brown sugar.  IT had a fantastic flavor on the front and back end.  Had enough spice to get your attention without leaving you needing to find the nearest glass of milk.  Definitely a keeper and one that we tried again using Chicken and Chicken stock.. just as good!

Not a fan of super spicey foods...so instead of the hot peppers and diced tomatoes...I used Rotel's tomatos and green chili peppers which still allowed for the extra spice without too much...and after reading the reviews...cut back on the sugar...Will make again....

I didn't add the coffee or beer, I added some sausage, but I also did it on my smoker in a Dutch Oven.  It was excellent chili.  I just tied for first place in a chili cook off.  (I tied with a Buffalo Chicken Chili, so this was the favorite of the "regular" chili's.)

A few changes: 1/3 cup brown sugar, rather than chili peppers I used 2 poblano peppers and 2 sriracha peppers (due to the snow-pocalypse of 2016 the store was out). I used to cans of dark kidney beans, one can of black chili beans, and one can of red beans. Used a can of Guinness for the beer. 
Seared .75 lb top round steak (cut into 0.5 in cubes, added 1 lb ground beef, cooked until 1/2 way browned, added onion and garlic. Plan to simmer 1.5 hours, allow to cool, place in fridge overnight, reheat, then serve. will update review tomorrow.

I added a bit of vinegar hoping to cut some of the sweetness out, next time I'll reduce the amount of brown sugar and probably leave out the cubed sirloin.  But the beer, chocolate, coffee and spices and peppers are a great combination

This was the best chili I have ever tasted and I am from Texas! perfect blend of seasoning all colliding together and creating a palate masterpiece. In the end I had the family fighting over the leftovers and who was going to take some to work the next day. I will definitely be making it again and again. I made one alteration and I added ground chuck.

Made it tonight initial flavors very tastee. Now melding in fridge for tommorows family xmas eve party.  We are huge craft beer lovers and were tasked with coming up with a recipe that involved  beer in the recipe and a beer paring to go with.  I used Oscar Blues Imperial Russian Stout which has notes of  chocolate covered carmel and coffee.  Beer was rich and black in color. Used 6 ounces Paul Newmans Own Special Blend coffee. Used the sirlion but instead of  ground beef  used ground bison from Costco.  Also added two cans of stems and pieces mushrooms ...drained.  And added two cans of diced tomatos with green chili's, two jalapeno, two dark red kidney and two black beans .  Hope the beer didn't add to much coffe and chocolate.....Will see  Going to serve with jalapeno green onion ale corn bread yum yum . Can't wait till xmas eve to try it...Merry Christmas

One of the best recipes for chili I have ever made. Perfect as written for the timid eater or easily juiced up  to whatever level you and your friends can take with Ghost Chillis, serranos, and habenaros. I have a group that loves heat. The beer and sugar balance the heat. First class recipe.

I made this chili several years ago with very minor changes and it was absolutely delicious. I had printed and saved it under it's original name "Ultimate Chili" and couldn't find it in my "collections" when I came back to look for it. For some reason it had been renamed and had disappeared from my saved recipes.  Not happy with this new site and wondering how many other of my saved recipes may have disappeared.

This is a great, extremely delicious recipe. I use a combination of jalapenos, habaneros and ghost chili peppers in mine, sometimes leave out the jalapenos, love spicy food.  I do not like to alter recipes very much, but for the beans I use two cans of dark red kidney beans, a can of black beans, and a can of pinto beans. I also leave out the brown sugar only because I don't like brown sugar. I'm sure for people who do like it, it is delicious in it as well :)

I have made this twice! Second time was on request!!! I made just two changes, I used 2 pounds ground chuck instead of the hamburger/sirloin combo. Then I swapped 2 cans of kidney beans (4 is a lot of beans!) for 1 extra can of diced tomatoes!!! Everyone loves it and tried to guess the exotic ingredients!!!!

I have made this chili many times.  Overtime I have tweaked pretty minor things to suit our preferences but the chili stands on it own "as written".  FOr anyone wondering -- my tweaks were only 2 cans of beans. I like 1 can kidney, 1 can northern and using Penzeys Chipotle powder in lieu of Cayenne. I like the smoky tones of chipotle.  I think the coffee, chocolate and beer add a nice rich flavor.  I have not cut back on the brown sugar because I like the sweet followed by a spicy finish.  As for beer, I mostly use guiness but lately have been just buying a single darker style beer recommended by my liquor store only because we're not beer drinkers and the rest goes to waste. In this last back I used an oatmeal stout and it was just as tasty.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  Took it to the university I work at for our office's annual chili cook-off. Our President attends and I won the Presidents choice award. Even better than 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place, IMHO!! Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is the best chili recipe out there. Choose a good dark beer, a good coffee and add or minus tomato paste, depends on what kind of thickness you desire. Amazingly awesome. We have made this probably over 20 times.

I made this chili close to the recipe, except I used ground Turkey.  Very flavorful and hearty.  I will definitely prepare this recipe again.

Absolutely the best chili you will ever taste.  I made this chili exactly as the recipe is set out.  Don't modify it if you haven't tasted it the way it was intended, first.  I have been making this chili for at least 5 years now, sometimes I use just ground beef, instead of the sirloin also.  And I never have left overs.  It is surely a crowd pleaser.  Kudos to Bob!

First review even thought I've used AR for years! I tried this chili 2 hours after I made it. I thought it was awful. I put it in the fridge for a couple of days because our family got busy. When we all finally sat down to a meal again, I was nervous. It was great!! It definitely needs time to come together. I cut the sugar in half per others suggestions and added an additional can of beef broth because it got very thick sitting for so long. I also cut back on meat just for personal preference. Otherwise, it was superb!

This is the base recipe for chili that I have consulted for over 2 years now. The very first time I followed it exactly - well almost, I think I used canned green chile's - and I was very impressed. Nowadays I leave out the beef broth and oregano, using a bit of beef bullion and another beer (not too sweet) instead. I always use Brooks Chili Hot beans and canned green chiles, and I usually add spicier peppers - 2 jalape√±o and 2 serrano, or habanero if nobody else is digging into it. I use coriander seeds instead of ground, and I use ground in addition to whole cumin seeds. I also use about half the recommended brown sugar. I've made a lot of different modifications over the course of using this recipe, but I always come back to use it as a base because it's really a fantastic chili.

Best chili I have ever made. It now replaces my old standby recipe of 28 years. The only chage I made was reducing the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. I left all else the same and we loved it.

It was too sweet. 

I would suggest cutting the brown sugar or cutting it in half at least.

 I add  salt later.

I have made this 3 times and everyone loves it. I don't even measure things accurately and it still tastes great. It is rich tasting and smokey. I use white beans. Delish for Grey Cup or Superbowl. I agree with others that it tastes far better the next day, so make it ahead.

Amazing depth of flavors in this chile!  It's like when wine snobs describe a good wine, very complex mixture of flavors that hit your palat at different times.  I made the recipe as written except for the beans, I did 2 cans in the beginning, and only added one 30 minutes before serving.  I used Negro Modello beer and thought it added the right flavor.  The texture of this chili is perfect as well, I love the mix of ground beef and chunks of sirloin too!  This is a keeper for sure!

It's 5 stars as long as you half the suggested amount on the brown sugar.  Too sweet otherwise.

UNIQUE & INCREDIBLE.  I tweeted it a little.  I put in dark baking chocolate instead of cocoa; black & kidney beans;
2-cups of strong coffee [steeped in french press].
Added extra cayenne to each bowl served for an extra kick!
Topped it with a dollop of sour cream & sprig of cilantro.

This recipe is awesome.  I do not put in any sugar or brown sugar.  If I don't have any beer, I will double the beef broth. I use 4 or 5 cans of different beans. Pinto, red, kidney, black and chili beans. I use 3 or 4 smoked jalapenos, depending on the size.  I have actually won chili contests with this recipe.  Thanks!!

Really good, although at first taste I wasn't sure.  By the 2nd day, I knew it was my favorite chili.  I'm not one to change recipes but I did add a can of corn for another veggie and some color.

My family's fav. chili recipe!  I need to go easy on the red pepper or it'd be just a little too spicy for our daughter.  Used coffee instead of beer when don't have beer in hand or to cut down on calories.  Either way, still tasty!

This is an excellent recipe! The coffee and beer and brown sugar really give a depth of flavor and complexity to this chili. As some reviewers mentioned I also decrease the amount of brown sugar significantly and substitute a can or two of black beans for some of the kidney beans. I also use a combination of half ground beef and half sausage for the meat. Lastly, I usually use a can of tomato soup instead of the beef broth.

I'm a huge chili over. My husband? Not so much. I had made this twice before he actually tried it. Now my hubby wants to make this every time we make our menu for the month!! It is the absolute BEST chili ever! And the best beer to use is Moose Drool. It adds just the right flavor. :-)

Tried it as close to instructions as possible and decided to tailor to our taste on the second batch. I added 1.5 lbs of meat, and seasoned it with Montreal Steak spice and Worcestershire sauce at least an hour before browning it. I cut half a pound of bacon in squares and cooked in a large sauce pan, removed the bacon and saved about 30ml of fat in the pan instead of the vegetable oil and cooked the rest of the meat in the same pan. Once the small sirloin cubes were browned and ground meat, garlic and onions were cooked, I dumped it all in a crock pot for a nice long 8hrs of slow cooking, we ate the next day for a deeper flavor. I used a Guinness, espresso beans to make the coffee, 2 habaneros for the peppers, wishing I would have had some chipotles on hand. Only one can of beans is enough for us. What you get is that sweet meaty chili and then the heat builds up. Heat lovers will want more fire.

THIS CHILI IS NOT SPICY AT ALL. There is a slight hint of spice in this chili, but it is a SWEET chili. I'm talking verging on the sweetness of candy sweet. While that may be a great thing for people who don't like or can't eat spicy foods, this is completely contrary to the kind of chili I grew up with. There is a definite distinct flavor in this chili that, while it's not a bad flavor, it is not worth beating down anyone's kitchen doors for. 

My favorite part of this chili was the steak chunks, and I will be implementing steak chunks in all future chili recipes, because I loved the texture it gave. However, over-all, this was a disappointing chili considering all the five-star ratings it received. I will not be making it again.

I make this chili ALL the time. The coffee and cocoa powder is KEY to making it rich. The type of peppers you put in will determine the spice level - the chili powder and one jalapeno is tame for even mild tasters. We usually put in 2 jalapeno and 1 habenero.  I would recommend dicing the onion and peppers up very small to help distribute the heat too. I usually halve this recipe, 1 lb ground beef (no chuck), 1 full can 14.5 tomatoes and a mix of kidney and chili/pinto beans - I drain the beans and tomatoes so it's not too watery.

This recipe the way is written is great! Of course like others, I modified some of the ingredients. I used 2.5 lbs of ground sirloin and 1 lb of Italian sausage with the casing removed. I saut√©ed a large onion, 3 stalks of celery, 1 green pepper and 1 yellow pepper in bacon fat. Added to my meat mixture. I used one can of chili beans, 1 can of white kidney beans not drained and I can of drained black beans. I used 4 bouillon cubes instead of the beef both because I wanted my chili to have a thicker consistency. I used Guiness beer and Starbuck's coffee. I used 4 cans of diced tomatoes, added some Worcester sauce, removed the coriander seeds and upped the chili powder to 4 Tbsps. I used 2 jalape√±o peppers, 1 Serrano, 1 poblano and 1 Anaheim pepper. I simmered for 4 hours and my husband and stepson LOVED it(I used the 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was not too sweet). I vacuumed packed  and frozen most and put a little aside for the next day and it was even better!

Too sweet for me but my son liked it and especially liked the sweetness. We both liked the depth the beer and cocoa gave it. The texture was perfect! Very comforting.

Made this last night for the first time for a group of restaurateurs no less and it went down a storm! I used extra mince instead of the sirloin and was a little heavier than suggested on the seasoning and it came out even better than expected! Also made sure I used a high quality beer, wheat based and largely on the hoppy side without the usual hints of banana that comes with a wheat beer.

I used this recipe in my first ever cooking contest and won 1st place.  I was a little skeptical with the odd combination of ingredients however, it tasted great.  Reading the other reviews it was noted that it is a little sweet the first day so I cut back on the brown sugar and I added more cumin, cayenne pepper, chili pepper, and 2 pounds more graound beef instead of the cubed sirloin.  I also added bell peppers and celery.  This is a very thick, spicy yet sweet recipe.  I can‚Äôt tell you enough how good this recipe was.  The other contestants were surprised when they heard what ingredients were in the recipe.  My suggestion is you make it as the recipe calls then tweak it to your taste.

I see why this received mixed revues.  I personally did not add brown sugar because I do not like sweet chili and I prefer chili beans to kidney beans.  My other change is that I hate anything with dark beer so I used a regular beer, but I followed everything else.  I thought it still needed a bit of flavor so I added a touch of white vinegar and love it.  My husband said it was delicious.  If you don't like beer you can substitute additional broth, which I believe I will do next time.

This had a very full chili flavor. I will use this recipe again in the future. I will probably cut the brown sugar back to either 1/3 cup or 1/4 cup.

This was wayyyy too sweet and I did not care for the mix of beer and coffee.  One or the other might be good.  I had several others taste it and they liked it a tad more but all agreed it was too sweet.

Love this recipe. When I made it the first time last winter I made it according to the original ingredients except for the sirloin, I used shaved steak because that what was I had,  that cooks down and almost melts into the chili! However, it was too hot and way too many beans. So, now I cut back the chili to 3 T mexican chili powder, 1/2 tsp of cayenne, I can of red kidney beans, 2 fresh jalapenas without ribs or seeds, and my husbands request of 2 15oz cans of hominy. I used Sam Adams Holiday Porter.  We top it with sour cream and grated cheddar cheese. This chili is so rich in taste!  The chocolate, the coffee, and the brown sugar balance the spices and the heat.  Absolutely fantastic!!

So amazing, I limit it to 3 cans of beans (put 2 in for the 2 hours and the 1 for 30 minutes.) I put jalapeno instead of chili.  I make it EXTRA spicy to get rid of how sweet it is.  I also limit the amount of brown sugar I use to less than the serving.  SO DELISH.

I've made this chili over and over again for several years. My husband loves it. I've used many variations after making it once or twice as written. This is definitely a chili you can change a bit to suit your tastes. My husband's and my tastes are that we like it sweet and with a lot of meat. I actually double the brown sugar and steak. But I cut the fat off the steak. That makes a sweet chili but it also has a kick. Some people definitely wouldn't like it my way but I think it's truly amazing.

I first printed this recipe in 2002 and have been making it ever since.  It has been a family favorite for years, and I just about panicked last year when I thought I lost this recipe and could not find it on the website (the name had changed slightly since 2002).  The only change that I made in the beginning was to use 1/2 the brown sugar and a can of rotel instead of chopping up chile peppers.  I always start it first thing in the morning in the crock pot and it is awesome by dinner.  We are finally hitting a frigid 59 degrees in Florida this weekend and this recipe is definitely on my agenda.

I've made this chili 3 times now and everyone that tries it says its the best chili they've ever had!! Thank you for sharing this recipe it is definitely one of my go to dishes now. I also love food you can throw in the crock pot and let it go, which is how I make this chili!! If you think coffee, beer, cocoa sound weird in chili you are correct lol but the taste is wonderful compliments to the chef :)

I loved the flavors in this chili - especially the flavors that were imparted by the beer, coffee and cocoa - they gave it a rich flavor beyond any other chili I've ever tried.  

My husband loved this!

Best chili I've ever had.  I cut the beans in half and doubled the meat...replaced the chili powder with same amount of Blended New Mexico Chile Peppers...upped the hot chili peppers from 4 to 6 and cut the brown sugar to 1/8 cup.  Taste was AMAZING...coulda been a little thicker, a little more heat and a TAD less sweet, but nearly perfect.

This chili is so delicious..it has the most amazing flavor!I've been making it for several years now.This is the Only chili recipe that I will use.And I'm the kind of person that loves to try different recipes. I make mine in the crockpot and let it cook all day. I do only use 1/4 cup brown sugar. I tried it both ways and I just prefer it with a little less. Maybe because my cornbread is so sweet. I also leave the chili peppers out and instead use 2 cans pinto beans with peppers added in place of 2 of the kidney beans. That's the only changes I make and this is just perfect chili! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Didn't have any brown sugar on hand, so used 1 tsp of molasses but it was a bit too sweet and a bit too spicy (if that's even possible) for me. Great ideas, but just seemed a bit much for me.

Just the right chili for my family of 6!  Not too sweet & not too spicy & just right in the middle.  It would be super easy to increase the heat with more pepper if that's what you like.  I can not do beer or coffee due to food allergies but even without these, this was a HIT with all my 4 kids, and husband.

Hubby that doesn't like chili thought this was great! I love chili, and thought it was just OK. Used a combo of pintos and white beans (we don‚Äôt like kidney). Needed more seasonings.

I love this recipe, though I have yet to make it with beer.  Just have not gotten around to it yet.  It is sweet and spicy, requested by family often, and fabulous as leftovers.

Yum yum yum.... This is a fantastic recipe!! Please do try this recipe as written to start. The combination of coco, coffee, and dark beer may sound strange but it is really great!! I didn't have any beef broth on hand so I used chicken broth. Do try this recipe. You will not want to go back to any other chili recipe!!

Made it the night before for Halloween and didn't change a thing!  Only omitted the ground beef and it still came out wonderful-everyone liked it.  Served it with the Taste of Home bread bowls-Superb!

This is a delicious chili! It turns out dark and rich, the combination of sirloin and ground beef gives a nice texture combination. I would add more hot peppers next time as I like a spicy chili. It is definitely on the sweet side which I like but be aware if you don't like sweet chili reduce the sugar.

I cut the brown sugar to 2 Tbsp but it was too sweet for me.  It did come in 2nd at a chili cook off at a friends Halloween party!  It was good but I prefer spicy to sweet so I probably won't make this again.

We thought with the strange combination of ingredients it could just work.  The flavor was interesting, but not what I usually have in mind when I think "Chili".  We made WAY more than 8 servings and had to cut the two remaining cans of beans because the pot was full.  The flavor is interesting, but way too sweet.  I don't think we'll be attempting this one again any time soon.  It's too complex for the strange result.

I made this the day before a party and thought it was just so-so.  However, I froze it and heated it up a few days later.  It was so much better!  It's a great recipe, but improves with time.  I thought it was missing something, so I added a little hot sauce and more salt.  Wonderful with fritos or tortilla chips and cheese to top it off!

Took it to a potluck and it was a hit!!  People were asking if it was a secret recipe. Chili is our friends favorite food and he declared this absolutely fabulous!! We made it in the crock pot and there was not room for the whole bottle of beer so we only used half, but that was all we changed and it was great. It is not a thick chili but has more liquid than most, which I like.

Good recipe!  It makes a ton, so be sure you have enough people around to eat it up!  It was pretty spicy (without the jalepenos) because I added an extra tsp of cayenne.  It was JUST RIGHT!  Nice recipe!

I have been making this recipe for several years and my husband thinks it's the best! I like other reviewers halve the sugar, and also use 2 jalepenos...4 is way too hot for me. The heat and flavor increase by the second day. I always make it with the homesteader cornbread recipe also on this site! YUM!
Perfect for a rainy day!

simple & amazing! 
we have made this... ok my husband has made this many times! Usually when famiyl is over for dinner it is a great make ahead of time meal. It takes  some time to prepare all the ingrediants but once its in the crock pot dinner is as good as done! 

The mixture of flavors & textures just wonderful! I have printed & given this recipe to many friends family & co workers.

This could be a personal preference on the sugar--but MUCH toooooo sweet.  Made exactly as stated other than omitted all but one jalapeno pepper and added a can of green chilis for myself(kids and husbands heartburn) and forgot to buy the dark beer so I used regular Coors Light. I love my chili hot--so perhaps  not getting to add all the peppers made a difference in the sweetness factor??? I keep eating it--but NONE of family was impressed.  Sad to say buy they would rather I buy Chilo-O mix than try any other homemade recipes.  (Not that I will listen!) The best one I have found so far has been the copy cat Wendy's chili recipe and I still have to tweak---any other suggestions?

I served this for dinner and got raves.  I'm not a beer drinker and was afraid it would have a "beer" taste.  Instead it gave the chili a nice flavor after it had simmered.  I'm looking forward to tasting the "next day" leftovers.

I started making this 6 yrs ago for Penn State tailgates- and haven't stopped since! My only tweak is nipping the sugar a bit and adding sausage instead of steak.  THE BEST!!! Thanks Bob!

I have made this recipe for over a year now.  It is by far the best I have tried.  Iuse lorna eby's suggestions and also up the steak amount.  No peppers (kids).  It is now part of our xmas eve tradition.  Thanks!

Really is an awesome chili recipe, I couldn't stop eating it the next day! 
I had to try this one after everything I read. I actually doubled the recipe, and started to be a little nervous once I put everything together in the pot because some of the ingredients are kind of different, but like all the other reviews say, it works and really is very good. Definitely tastes better after sitting overnight in the fridge. I used all ground beef instead of cubed steak and used ground cumin instead of cumin seeds (used about half as much also).  

Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is Chili is absolutely the best!  I always make it in the winter, when  we have friends over to watch Football games.  All of my friends crave this stuff year round.  I remember reading the ingredients the first time and thought to myself cocoa, beer, coffee?  It all works out, and this stuff is hands down the  best chili I have ever had.  Stop reading this review, and start making this chili.  You can thank the person that posted this later!!

This is a great basic chili recipe which I've made over and over again. I usually make a full pot then freeze it into smaller portions to eat later since it's just myself and my husband. Used to take it to work with us for lunch and actually had people stop and ask to try it...or if we'd bring some in for them too :-)

Great recipe! I only added 1/2 the cans of beans and it was sooooo good! Very spicy and makes a great dipping soup for grilled cheese sandwiches! I didn't  have a dark beer and used a light-colored one instead and it was terrific! Definately my new go-to chili recipe!

I made this last year for Super Bowl and came looking for it again for this year. Yes, it sounds weird. But it was GOOOOOD.  Last year was the first year I had no chilli leftovers, and it's not because my chilli wasn't good before - it was just that this was the best.

I couldn't believe that I made it my self! So delicious, my husband and I licked our bowls clean! Used ground turkey instead of ground beef and only had 2 cans of kidney beans on hand. Followed the rest to a tee. This will be a staple in our house!

This was a wonderful chili.  I followed the recipe except for substituting the chili peppers with a green pepper.  My kids say it's too spicy so I will cut back the cayenne next time to see if they like that more.  There are a few cornbread recipes on this site that compliments this nicely.

I made this recipe for a football game.  The hostess also made a pot of chile.  This recipe was gone while the other remained untouched.  I knew I had a hit when the guys were scraping the last morsels with corn bread. Excellent. Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

A wonderful recipe for Chili, which tastes like Chili should. My recipe I've been using for years remindes me of spaghetti sauce with chili powder. The family loved this recipe and were shocked at some of the ingredients used. *Yummy*

I have made this chili more than once and it has always been a hit; anyone who questions the combo of beer, cocoa and coffee has to realize that each of those flavours are complimentary and the Guinness already does have notes of both coffee and chocolate. It should also be noted that some of the negative reviews which site the presence of cocoa as a reason for the sweetness may have been using something other than the ingredient listed (unsweetened cocoa is bitter, not sweet). The combination of chocolate and spice is common and goes together beautifully. If it's too sweet cut down or omit the brown sugar, otherwise this recipe is a keeper for me and a whole warehouse full of men who always ask me to bring it in for pot luck work lunches :)

Unbelievable recipe...only changes were to double the meat and cut down on the beans (hubby's request) and didn't include the peppers (to be kid friendly).

Outstanding!  Boy, this chili definitely has a kick to it! I'm going to fix this quite often.  Like some of the other ratings, I didn't add quite as much brown sugar...probably only 1/4 cup.  I also didn't add the chili peppers. With as much cayenne pepper, I didn't think it needed those.  I didn't have beef broth.  I had vegetable broth instead and it still turned out great!

Delicious!  I won a chili cook-off with this recipe as the basis.  Of course, I always change things -- if I remember correctly I added more of the cocoa and more red pepper flakes.  It was very spicy -- definitely needed cheese and sour cream on it.  YUM!  People were raving!

The best chili recipe ever!  This is a big crowd-pleaser -- the amount of heat is just enough to satisfy those who like spicy chili, but not enough to scare people away.  I usually halve the beans and add more sirloin.  I've started making double batches because it's so easy to freeze and reheat.  Mmm...winter comfort food!

Wow!  This is the BEST chili I've ever had.  I received many compliments when I made it for friends.  I substituted sausage for the sirloin, since that was all I had.  I also used a variety of bean in the chili to add different levels of color.  I'm making my second pot right now for my friends tomorrow, and I can hardly wait!

We didn't enjoy this all that much.  It almost seemed like a waste of good beer and coffee.  I only used 1/2 the sugar and it was still way too sweet.  There was just something that wasn't right, something missing.  My boyfriend who will usually eat 3 huge bowls of chili only had one and I had to choke my small bowl down.  I gave this 3 stars, though, because it tasted better a couple days later (this was too expensive to let go to waste!).  Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll move on and find one better suited to our tastes.

This chili is the best, best ever! It is well worth the effort. Make it as is with the beer, coffee, and chocolate. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very good chili.  I always add more garlic to everything because I like it, and I also left out the fresh chile peppers, but other than that I made it as-is and it's fantastic.

I made this yesterday and DH and I both enjoyed it. I served it on top of a few Fritos with chopped onion, grated cheddar and sour cream for toppings. This isn't our typical Texas style chili, but since I wanted something different it was perfect. The changes/adjustments I made due to reading the reviews and using what I had on hand: 1 can of chili beans and 2 cans of great northern beans instead of the kidney beans, less than 1/4 c. of brown sugar (I would use even less next time) and no beer. I will definitely make this again and I plan on having the beer...to add to it and to drink with it! I think this would be great used as a hot dip by adding lots of cheddar cheese. It would be much better than the canned chili I usually use (canned chili for the dip - never as a bowl to eat!). Thanks Bob!!

So good and so easy! I was asked to bring chili to an office potluck, and have never made it before in my life. I turned to AllRecipes.com and looked for the one with 5 stars and the most reviews. When I read that people made this for chili cook off's I was sold. Everyone at my office raved, including people who go to chili cook off's! I took the advise of others and only put in 1/4c brown sugar, 3 cans of beans and doubled the ground beef to stay on budget and feed lots of people. Great recipe and a real crowd pleaser!

This chili was a hit at my super bowl party yesterday.  It wasn't as spicy as I had expected but terrific nonetheless.  I'll definitely make it again!

Excellent! We enjoyed the small cubed steak mixed with ground chuck. Everytime I reheat it, we can smell the beer! Used Negra Modelo and it was wonderful for this recipe. Will definitely cut back sugar next time because it is pretty sweet. Used up to 3 cans of kidney beans.

I made this recipe exactly as written, for the exception of only adding 2 cans of beans instead of 4.  At first, the taste of coffee was overpowering, and I was concerned.  As it cooked in the slow cooker, the flavors joined together.  I did add more of the flavorings than called for to help hide the coffee flavor.  I will keep on my search for the best chili recipe.

This chili was delicious! My only complaint is that it is much too sweet for my taste.  Next time, I will take the advice of others, and cut the sugar quantity in half.  I also accidentally left out the coriander, but I don't think it would have made any difference.  The other indgredients give this chili more than enough flavor.

I wasn't a fan of chili until I made this for my family.  WE LOVE IT!  I have made it four times in the last 3 weeks.  The addition of Beer, Coffee and Brown Sugar (some of our favorite things) made this really yummy and perfect for leftovers!  Defintely use the sour cream and cheese as a compliment.

Definitely a killer chili. This was delicious but I found the flavor a tad overwhelming. Next time I will add a bit less salt and sugar and perhaps cut back a smidgeon on the spices.

Unfortunately I took a recommendation of a previous reviewer to put it in the crockpot.  I wanted a recipe that would cook while a late football game was on.
It wasn't very good but my family ate it.  I will try again with the original recipe.  It sounds yummy!

It took me a long time to cook and all this time I was not sure if it would be edible as it tasted really bitter and the flavours didn't meld together. I added extra sugar, lemon juice and tomatoes. My boyfriend and his mate quite liked it with grated cheese and sour cream but I still thought it weird. Was wonderful the next day though!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  He ate 2 huge bowls and got sick because he ate so much!  I did not have any coriander on hand, so it was ommited, but you couldn't tell.  Make sure you let it cook for at least an hour.  I noticed the flavor changed (for the better) after simmering for a while.

I made this for my bunco group and everyone loved it.  (the theme was beer/Oktoberfest)  To be honest, the heat factor was almost outside my comfort zone, but I'm a big wimp about spicy foods.  Still, I thought the flavor was great and the recipe was relatively easy to make.  

I left out the coriander (because I didn't have it) and used less brown sugar.

I was really excited to try this after all the great reviews, but I was pretty disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the ground beef. I froze all the ingredients before cooking (to minimize prep time) but it may have altered the flavor. It was pretty bitter. It had a lot of spice, but not a lot of desirable taste. I'm sure it was just me. I should try it again without freezing, but for now I'll look for an easier recipe. Thanks, anyway.

This was an unusual recipe, but I decided to try it anyway.We all liked it alot. I cut the beans in half because we like our chili more meaty. I will definately make it again!

Great recipe.  Best homemade chili I've ever made, thats for sure. I only had a green bell pepper & a jalepeno, but it was still amazing. Thanks for sharing a great recipe Bob!

This recipe was great!  I did make a few changes: I used 2 pounds of ground turkey, omitted the chile peppers and sprinkled a small amount of red pepper flakes for a little kick! We don't like our chile too hot.

WAY too many ingredients.  I'm a bachelor and like recipes with as few ingredients as possible.  This may be a "great" chili, but one I won't be cooking.

Absolutely WONDERFUL! My husband loved it. I changed the half cup of brown sugar to a fourth. The grocery store I went to was out of the fresh hot chili peppers so I substituted them for 4 fresh hot jalapeno peppers, I also use ground cumin instead if the whole seeds. My inlaws loved it as well. This does take a long time to make but it is well worth it. I will try with the red chili peppers next time but it was AWESOMW with the jalapeno. THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE. It is a favorite in my house!

THE BEST CHILI WE EVER HAD!!  I ONLY ADDED 2 OF THE 4 FRESH HOT PEPPERS, AND IT WAS JUST RIGHT FOR US, NOT TOO HOT AND NOT TOO SWEET.  I MAY ADD AN EXTRA CAN OF TOMATO NEXT TIME.  DONT LEAVE OUT THE SIRLOIN, IT MAKES IT EXTRA SPECIAL AND GETS VERY TENDER. MAKE SURE YOU COOK IT THE FULL 2 HRS, ITW WORTH THE WAIT! I HAVE TO WONDER IF BOB IS A FIREMAN, TO HAVE SUCH A FAB RECIPEE FOR CHILI!! THANKS!

I just made this and it was great!!!  My husband loved it but best of all my picky 8 yr old son loved it as well.  I would have never made this if it hadn't been for the wonderful reviews, they were so helpful.  When I doubled the recipe I only put in one beer and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added an extra can of diced tomatoes and it tasted perfect.  Who would of thought that cocoa, beer and coffee would go so well in chili.

This is outstanding.  I didn't have any coriander and I don't think it really mattered.  My 4 kids (6,7,9,10)all love this.  My husband wants to invite all of his friends over for it!  I only used 2 cans of kidney beans and I think it was plenty.  Also, I just used 2lbs ground beef and no sirloin.  This will make anyone look they can cook. Thanks Bob!!

WOW!!!! This is the strangest concoction I have ever made. I brought it to work and got good reviews and I enjoyed it as well. I CAN'T handle spicy stuff and this is WICKED spicy, but the sweetness balances it when you taste it. Your mouth goes crazy with the blend of different flavors! As much as I liked this, I still use my "regular" chili recipe whenever I want regular ole chili! I use this one when I want something different. (It needs a better name than Chili I, as its too interesting for such a bland name!)

This recipe was out of this world! After browning the meat, I placed everything in a large slow cooker overnight on low, for a grad. party early afternoon the next day.   I did not have beer in the house, so I added wine instead (white zinfandel).  When I woke up, I added the final 2 cans of beans and cooked for 1/2 hour more.  It was the first dish to go and EVERYONE raved about it!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe:  Best chili ever!!!

Great recipe. I was curious to try this out with all the different ingredents.  I tried it the first night I made it an it tasted bitter and I was worried but I let it simmer on low for six hours and allowed the flavors to mix. Very good chili. I served it at a party the next day and everyone loved it.

I was a little apprehensive with all the odd ingredients but the reviews were so good I thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I did!  It was, hands down, the best chili I've ever had.  Served it at a Superbowl party and everyone loved it.  I would have liked it a little more spicy myself but everyone else thought it was just right.  It has officially replaced my previous chili recipe.

WOW!  Hot stuff darling.  This curled my husbands tounge...and he was literally crying for more.  I found it a tad spicy myself, cut down on the cayenne pepper with the next batch.  This is by far, the best Chili recipe I've ever had.....don't tell my mother!!

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times and I have cravings for it.  Now that I have made this one I don't like eating anyone elses, I have a biased opinion.  I cook it longer on low heat and I serve it over rice and cheese.  My family also enjoys it, I have a 18 month old and he loves it; I add some sour cream to his just to take away from the spice a little bit.  I didn't think that it tasted like a tradional chile and I didn't think that it was to sweet but everyone has different tastes,  I recommend this recipe!

My family cannot believe how wonderful this chili is with the cocoa and beer and coffee.  I use all beef sirloin.  It's easier to cut when partially frozen.

THANK YOU, BOB!!  I've been trying to find a really good chili recipe, and this is it.  Did exactly as the recipe said, except I used 2 cans of red kidney beans and 2 cans white kidney beans.  
My husband says it's the best he's ever had.

Wow! Now I know why this has 5 stars and so many great reviews! It was the best chili I've ever made. The flavor of the cocoa and coffee and beer really added something. This is my new chili recipe!! It even freezes well.
Thanks Bob!

I've never made chili before and my family loved this! The sauce is outstanding. I modified the recipe for our taste and used suggestions from other posting: knocked the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, used 2 cans of kidney beans, since we don't like it hot I used only 1 chili pepper and no cayenne.

By family vote, I just got another excellent recipe for dinner.

Wow! This is good chili... I stuck as  close to the recipe as I could with the ingredients I had on hand.  I am on a low carb diet so I did omit the brown sugar and it was still rich dark and yummy.  I used the chili powder to taste since I can't get the Mexican chili powder right now as I am out of the country.  The Mexican chili powder is a blend of chili powder, cumin, paprika, etc. and is medium hot compared to  straight chili powder.  I think this is why some people had the problem of the chili being too hot.  My opinion is to use all the ingredients as listed, making sure the chili powder is the Mexican type, not the fiery hot type, try using brown sugar and leave it out if you don't like sweet at all and you will be pleased with the results.

A little too sweet for my taste. Next time maybe cut the sugar in half. Otherwise, pretty good.

Rave reviews by all!!! All 6 dinner guests commented that it was the richest and the best chili they'd ever tasted!  The only thing I changed was the beef sirloin...and used filet mignon instead, only because I already had it on hand and had bought it at an incredible sale at the store.  Recipe is now posted on the fridge at the cabin!!!

I made this chili for work and went over great! They could not believe all the weird things in the chili. I did alter your recipe slightly. Instead of cubed beef I made a roast and slow cooked it until the meat came apart in sherds with the ground beef it gave the chili a wonderful texture. Also I used Jalapeno peppers instead of chilis and used 8 of them. My 16 year old son had told the whole neighborhood that I was making chili with beer, coffee and chocolate in it. I had a line at my front door for taste tasting!! It was great!

After reading the combination of ingredients, I couldn't help but try this recipe!  I don't like a lot of spice, so I didn't add the peppers or cayenne pepper, but did add an extra tablespoon of chili powder.  I was also too cheap to buy ground coriander ($5 a jar!) so I replaced it with celery salt.  This recipe is very good!

I doubled this recipe and served it for the Superbowl.  Everyone raved about the chili, even though the game didn't turn out the way we would have liked.  The only thing I changed was to add about 1/2 tsp more salt.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  This chili was EXCELLENT!

This is a very good recipe.  I left out the beer,chili peppers and used cumin powder.  My Grandkids don't like it to hot.  I also used my own prepared small red beans instead of kidney beans.  Kids loved it.

All I can think is that they make chili powder MUCH hotter here in England than they do in the United States!  I made the first pot and had to throw it away because it was SO hot.  I made the second pot using less than a quarter of the chili powder, no cayenne and only two chili peppers.  I used all stew meat and doubled up on the coffee, cocoa, cumin, oregano and coriander.  I also used Guinness.  The second pot was wonderful and definitely a keeper. The coffee and cocoa really had flavour.

This recipe is simply THE BEST!!  I changed only a few things, I use black beans and pinto beans, no kidney beans.  I also use Ancho Chili Powder, and Negro Pasilla Chili Powder.  I season the meat as it's cooking, then season the whole pot as well.  I also use the hot coffee to dissolve the brown sugar & cocoa powder, then add the spices in & pour all into the chili.  Great Recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  I made this for 30 people and also made a vegan version based on this recipe.  I used guinness for the beer and added some black beans in place of some of the kidney beans.  Everyone loved it and was quite surprised when I told them some of the ingredients.  For the vegan version, I omitted the meat, broth, cocoa and beer, and added more black beans along with some extra vegetables, such as green beans and green bell peppers.  I also made up some vegan taco filling (ground beef substitute) as an option to put in it.

I was really excited about this recipe because it has so many great reviews; but,  I just didn't care much for it.  Waaaaaay to much sugar!!!  The dark beer really does give it a boost, and the chocolate too.

This was good but it lacked the punch in the face hot flavor, I added a couple habanero peppers and a few other things to take care of it. I'll make it again but with some doctoring.

As son of a Texan, I approve highly.  Very similar to Texas chili, with the exception of the ground beef.  I left the ground beef in and have to admit I liked it.  I also added red, green and yellow pepper that I prepared with the onion.  As husband of a German, I unfortunately had to turn the heat down a bit, the recommended amount of chili and cayanne pepper does not make for a heat level the extreme majority of Americans would not enjoy.  Awesome recipe, I will definitely make this again.

Well, my husband really loved this, but I wasn't a big fan of it.  I think it had too much of a coffee flavor, personally.  But, the husband has forbidden me to scrap the recipe completely, so it looks like I'll be making modifications until I'm happy with it.  Not what I was expecting though...

Wow! What a great recipe! I'm not even a big chili eater, but love this one.  We never eat leftovers, but it was way better the second day and even the third.  I used all cubed sirloin and half of the recommended brown sugar, which turned out to be perfect. Didn't have any chili peppers or dark beer, so I used half a can of regular beer and dried crushed red pepper.  Next time I will use the chilis and dark beer. Thanks, this one went into my regular recipe box!

Sorry, but I thought this chili was, at best, just okay.  I would have given this chili 1 star, but my husband thought it was "pretty good."  Something about the flavor of this chili was just not working for me.  I didn't find this chili spicy AT ALL.  I will not make this chili again.

I've been making this chili for years, and it's always a huge hit.  I made it exactly as written the first time and, like others, thought  it was a bit too sweet. I now cut the sugar in half and add some smoked paprika.  So good!

I eliminated the cheyenne pepper and chili peppers because we don't like things hot.  I was worried about the 3-1/2 T. of chili powder, but it was fine.  I made the beans in my pressure cooker rather than using canned.  I used 2 cups of dried kidney beans and 2 cups of dried red beans.  Very good.  I will make it again.

all i can say is "excellent." very good chili. i made this as written, except used all hamburger since i had no sirloin. also i mashed the 4th can of beans for more thickness.
for my personal preference i will probably halve the brown sugar next time. and there will be a next time, this is a keeper!

Like all the rest of the reviews said....One of the best Chili recipes out there. I made it for company, it was a huge hit. Since it was for company, I did leave out the peppers, but did add ground cumin. I put some hot sauce on the table for anyone who wanted to "heat" it up more.

This chili is quite delicious. I was intrigued by the list of ingredients and thought that I should try to make it. Until now I had only eaten chili out of a can. This chili was very good and my family enjoyed it. I used only ground beef, because that's the way my father likes it. Also I couldn't find cumin seeds, so I substituted ground cumin. The recipes calls for hot chile peppers, so I just used four serrano peppers, two with seeds and veins, and two without. The chili has a very good balance of sweet and spicy. I didn't use the beer in the recipe, because my mother doesn't like it. But this recipe is a keeper in my recipe box.

I have to say I was very disappointed with this recipe after I read all of the rave reviews.  It was just so-so.  I won't ever make this one again!  I guess I was expecting something great because of the other reviews, but it definitely wasn't, in my opinion.

I made this recipe for the first time and it was really wonderful in flavor, I did not add peppers but I should have. When I make this recipe again, I will add more meat and probably 2 cans of beans, my family loved it but they thought it was a bit soupy and would have preferred it to be thicker. I am not a chili eater and I have never made chili so this was an awesome find for me here in All Recipes my favorite recipe finder!
Thank you BOB!

The ingredients are ususual and the smell was odd at first but that went away and was good. Will make again and play with the recipe.   Better the second day.  We only used one can of beans and that was enough for us.  We will increase the ground beef next time and leave out the cubed sirloin.  Maybe we didn't cook the sirloin long enough but it seemed weird to chew my chili.

Very Good.  Made a few small changes.  Used 2 cans of kidney beans and about 1 1/2 pounds cubed sirloin and 1 ppound ground beef.  I made it in the crock pot and let it cook on low all day.  I was a little apprehensive after asembling it.  But when I got home from work and tasted it after cooking all day, my apprehension was unwarranted.  Definitly will make again.

This chili was fantastic! I didn't have dark beer so I used regular and I don't like beer anyway so I only used 1/2 can.  Also instead of 4 cans of kidney beans I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cans of pinto beans.  I also did not use hot peppers because of my children and it was still spicy enough. My family and I enjoyed this recipe and I will definately make it again!

My family (even my fussy 7 year old) thought this chili was awesome!  I was a little skeptical because I had never made chili with beer, coffee or cocoa but the tastes were wonderful.  We topped with sour cream, cheese and Fritos and it made an excellent dinner. Thanks Bob!

This is hands-down the best chili I have ever tasted.  I have entered a few competitions with it and have done well in them.   Over time, I have made just a few modifications, including the following:
* I use the darkest ale/malted beer/beer that I can find, and I use the entire can/bottle ( but not if it is a huge volume).
* I get a good chuck roast and cut it into small pieces in place of the specified beef.
* I use four different cans of beens:  kidney beans, chili beans, hot chil beans, and whatever other beans look good. 

People always love this chili.   I have made it at least 50 times, and I try other recipes from time to time‚Äîbut this is the one I keep coming back to on cold, wet days like today.

I made this for the office for lunch it was loved by all, even the people that wanted beanless chili ate this up!  I quadrupled the recipe so I had some for home and work and it wasn't too spicy----which is ok because I wanted people to spice it up the way they wanted.  It was suggested I enter this in the chili cookoff, I'll make sure to note where and from whom I got it!  Thanks Bob!

This recipe is really good.  I gave it four stars because, after all the reviews, I was expecting to be wowed by this great chili.  I didn't think it was exceptional or even special.  Still, it is a lot better than the store bought spice packets and I will use this recipe as my staple until I find a better one.

Actually 4 1/2 stars.  I really loved the flavor of this chili, my husband thought it was "different tasting" (what does he know, anyway)  I thought it was great, it was a little different than traditional chili, but differnt in a good way, the beer and coffee add an excellent taste, When mine was simmering, I thought it was a bit too thin, so I thickened it, which I shouldn't have done, because after it simmered for a while it got WAY too thick, my fault, next time I will leave it AS IS.  All the spices were perfect in combination and in proportion.

Incredible Chili.  I modified it using 3 beers, different chili's=cerrano's, less onion and a lot less beans/more meat....the way me and friends like it.  Everyone raves about it.  Oh also added 1 red, 1 yellow, and 1 orange pepper.  Ads a bit of sweetness to it.

I love this!!! Omitted sirloin & used 2 lbs. lean gr. beef. Used 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/2 t. cayenne, & 3 cans kidney beans.(left out chile peppers) Yes, lots of ingredients- but worth it!!!!

Awesome recipe!  I'm on the Weight Watcher's Core plan, so I didn't add the brown sugar, beer or chocolate and only added 2 chili's instead of 4 (to spare my wife).  Still came out great!

This chili is so good you'll eat it when you are too full! I followed the recipe pretty close, used yellow chili peppers instead of green, heat was perfect for us,my 9 year old son could eat it. Simmered for two hours on stove, then left in fridge overnight, put in crock pot on low for 4 hours the next day. I think the cocoa and coffee give it a roasted flavor, set off nicely by the brown sugar and beer.

This chili was good.  I thought it was a little too sweet even after cutting the brown sugar in half, but it still had a good taste.  I didn't add any chili peppers, and I thought it had a nice kick to it.

This was just ok. At first it was lovely but it left a bitter after taste in your mouth. I have never made chili before. Think I will try another recipe without such crazy ingredients before I play around with this one. I think it was the coffee which gave it the bitter flavour.

I tied for third place in a chili contest with this recipe.  It is your stereotypical-tasting chili, but there's nothing outstanding about it.  It's a good standard recipe to keep.

Very good recipe.  I've made it exactly to spec, following the recipe to a T and had rave reviews.  Last night, I threw it together, reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, using ground beef only, substituting spicy V8 in place of the beef broth and rather than one cup of coffee, used one cup of spicy V8 with 1 tablespoon of instant coffee granules.  Tastes just as good, especially after sitting in the fridge overnight!

I've cooked a lot of chili, and this is by far the best.  I use dried chipotle chilies soaked in boiling water instead of fresh chilies, and if I have chipotle chili powder I use a bit of that too.  Amazing.

Woah! Awesome chili recipe!!  A friend recommended it, so I tried it the first time for a family dinner.  It was a huge hit, albeit A LITTLE SPICEY! I used HOT chili powder (on 2 tsps) but I think next time I'll cut that back even more.  Only 1 tbsp brown sugar as well, as so many have recommended.  This one's sure to become a family favourite.  Thank you Bob, wherever you are!

We never made Chili from scratch before. My office had a Chili cook-off so we tried this one. FIRST PLACE - out of 14 contestants. I used a Pale Ale beer and only 2 cans of kidney beans and let it simmer in a crock pot for 8 hours.
This ones a keeper --  Thanks Bob!

It certainly has potential.  I used Miller light rather than a dark beer, which I believe was a mistake, as the resulting coffee and sweet taste was too strong.  Next time, I'll use a good dark beer and reduce the brown sugar.

This chili was great! I only used 1 onion and 2 cans of beans, I am not a big fan of either. I used 1 habanero pepper b/c my husband likes his food really spicy. I will make this again!

This was my first attempt at chili.  It was really easy and everyone loved it.  I'm a little white Italian girl from Boston so anything with "heat" scares me!  I now live in San Diego where Mexican and spicy foods are king so I'm trying to adjust to my friends' tastes.  I only used one jalapeno and to me, that was spicy enough.  That was really the only complaint from the crowd and that was my fault so I can't give it less than 5 stars even though they didn't rate it as high.  They all said that it was a great 1st attempt!  I had to thicken it up with a little bit of cornstarch but I loved it and will make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.  :)  Oh, I agree that it's better the second day, especially if you don't like it as spicy.  Today is day three and I brought some leftovers for lunch.  Yum!

Awesome Chili!   I like my Chili spicy so I added crushed red pepper, more cayanne, and tobasco. The spicyness really goes well with the sweetness.  My guess is those that found this too sweet cut back on the spice.  I also use black beans along with the kidney beans.  Dont skimp on the spice and use all the ingredients!  The cocoa, brown sugar, coffee and beer make this.  Tastes even better the next day and smells incredible!

Great recipe! This is the second time I have used this recipe. I omitted the beans since I do not care for them. I also added a variety of 7 different peppers (including jalepenos, yellow, red and green pepper). I used Amerbock beer. The first time I made it I went overboard with the HOT peppers, and got a suggestion from another member to add cocoa or hersey kisses to the recipe to tone it down. I used cocoa, and it worked.

Excellent Chili recipe, the beer, cocoa and coffee give it a different taste. My boyfriend said "I can tell there is a whole lot of things in there but I can't put my finger on any of them" His friends also enjoyed it even the one that never eats anywhere but his own home and a fast food restaurant had two bowls! It is even better the next day!  Bravo Bob!

This chili recipe was pretty good.  Waaaay too many kidney beans though.  I'd definately scale it back a bit.  And, I didn't really find it that spicy hot, but again, everyone's tastes are different.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I didn't use beef broth, however used 1 cup demi-glace.  It really added some richness.

Definately better on day two.

My husband made this chili himself.  He followed the instructions to a T and it came out perfectly.  We're entering it into a chili cookoff this weekend and I'm confident that we'll win.  Great recipe!

This recipe was great!  My husband absolutely loved it.  He kept saying how good it was all night.  He even cleaned the kitchen after dinner as thanks for making such good chili.  My husband even mentioned passing the recipe on to our children. And to top it all off, he said that it was better then his mother's chili, and he was serious.  The only thing I changed on the recipe was the peppers.  I skipped adding those to cut down on the spice. I also added a little extra ground beef for a meatier taste.  This is an awesome recipe.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!! It has a great deep chili flavor -- much more than my regular chili. I didn't have the sirloin cubes, I just used a combo of 1/2 TVP & 1/2 ground beef & extra green peppers & onions. I stay away from too spicy stuff for the kids & hubby, and this recipe is a great balance of flavor & heat. Also, the flexibility makes this recipe awesome for any and all substitutions! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is awesome!  The only thing I did differently was cut the brown sugar in half based on what other reviewers said.  I entered in a chili cookoff and took first place out of 13 chilis.  Definitely a keeper!!

Some of the ingredients may look strange, but this was really good.  I had a couple of friends over to taste test this with me - we couldn't stop eating it.  I used all ground beef, light beer, and 2/3 kidney beans 1/3 black beans.  Turned out very tasty!

The best chili, bar none. The ingredients can be easily adjusted to suit, but make sure you add them all! You won't regret it.

i made this recipe and thought it extremely dark & rich-was very excited for the result and i guess there was too much hype- It was a little sweet and thick for my taste and not enough tomato taste. Could only eat one bowl- felt very heavy. Husband didn't care for it-i made it for him. It was definitely edible however- good and spicey. Smell phenomenal. Lots of work.

After seeing coffee, beer and cocoa in this recipe I thought it was a little weird but I tell you it's AWESOME! For years my chili has been too tomatoee, this solves that problem.  It's beefy and rich. For a family of 4 I cut everything back by half except the meat (we love meat) and it was plenty.  Thanks BOB.

It was very interesting!  My husband and I liked it, but I don't think it will become our "regular" chili recipe--I prefer the "Ultimate Chili".  Tied for third in the chili cookoff (out of seven chilis submitted).

This is definetly a different tasting chili. My family and friends enjoyed it. Does have a strong beer taste to it. It was easy to make in the crock pot. Great on those cold winter days. Boy are we having those this winter. Thanks Bob for a chili recipe that is different from the typical chili.

With all the great reviews and the 5-star rating, I was really hoping I would win the chili cookoff where I work!  Well, I didn't, in fact, mine got the least votes of any of the 10 entries.  But I thought it was really very good, loved the layers of flavor that the unusual combination of ingredients gave. I made the recipe with only two minor changes; I omitted the sirloin and used all ground beef, and reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, based on other reviews and suggestions.  Oh well, you win some, you lose some!

As with others, I was a little hesitant because of some of the ingredients.  However, it was excellent!  My husband loved it. 3 out of the 4 children loved it.  The other child ate it, but said it was a little spicy for her.

Good! very good!  But I still like better the very simple, yet even more delicious chili made with Bush's Chili Magic to which I add ground beef and a can of tomatoes.  Chopped onion optional.

This chili is great!  Everybody I gave it to just loved it!  The only changes I made were I used ground turkey instead of beef to cut back on the fat.  Lots of ingredients give it a unique flavor.  Definitely a winner!

cooked in crock pot for 5 hours 1 1/2 days before serving and then put in refridgerator.  absolutely awesome!!.  I would suggest draining cans of kidney beans before adding to thicken it up slightly, but will have again!

Very tasty! I added 1c chx broth, some chopped jalapenos & extra garlic, I only used 1/4c brown sugar, other than that exactly as written. Served with Amusement park cornbread (found here) & shredded Mexican style cheese. Wonderful flavor especially on days 2 & 3. Thanks Bob!

This was really, really good chili. I have three chili recipes (this one being the newest) and this one beats the other two by far. I modified it a bit, cutting down on the amount of brown sugar (I used a little over a half a cup), plus I mixed kidney and black beans for variety. I also only cooked the black beans for about 10 minutes at the end, since I didn't want them to end up too soft.

The one other modification I would make would be to cut down on the cayenne, as it was a tad too fiery (this from someone who loves very hot food).

Otherwise, highly recommended! Make with a side of fresh cornbread and you're set for a cold winter's night.

Was good but needed some changes made. 2nd time I made it I added more Chili powder ( 5 TBLS in total ) and less cocoa powder. Was better that way. Still would recommend it for chilli lovers.

Very tasty.   A BIT too sweet for my tastes, but not bad enough to lose any stars over it.

I mistakenly used sweet (not hot chili) peppers and one fewer can of beans.  Perhaps that would have made all the difference in counteracting the extra sweetness.

All the guests said it was perfect!

This chili was OK.  Too sweet for my family's taste.  If I make it again I'd leave out the brown sugar and maybe cut down on the beer.

Excellent!  I used just 1 can of tomato paste and 1/4 cup brown sugar and omitted the hot chili peppers.  Great spice without being too hot.

I gave this 4 only because my husband and mother in law loved it. It was way to sweet and I added more coffee,beer and tomatoes than what the recipe called for. I probably wont make it again, but for those who like sweet chili go for it!

Found this recipe a little time consuming. Flavor was pretty good, but not great.  I read the previous reviews, and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, used 2 cans of beans, increased the meats by 1/2 lb each, used 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/green chilies, only 1 can of tomato paste & decreased the peppers to 2.  My family said they preferred my mom's chili recipe, and we're known for trying new recipes (as many as 5 a week) so it can't be because we're close-minded.  Thanks for the recipe, though.  It was fun to try something new.

Thought this one sounded a bit odd, but I was looking for something a little different.  I used 2 tablespoons instant coffee and 8 ounces of water instead of brewed coffee and I used stewing beef and doubled the amount. The flavor was great.  Everybody loved it and even wanted in the next night.

Wow!!  Great, but I changed a couple of things: used more meat, less beans, 2T instant coffe granules instead of cup coffee, and added bacon and fresh chopped bell and hot peppers.  This is the first "hot" dish I've ever made where my hubby didn't feel the urge to add tobasco sauce!

This was outstanding!  The choice of green chile peppers really can alter the degree of spice in this dish.  And choosing one beer over another can be another means of changing the flavor.  Just be ready to chop a lot of onions!

Made this for the superbowl and WOW!! As a first time chili-maker, it was a lot of work but worth it! I tried to double it (had about 16 people). I would say this recipe would feed 12-15 people as-is,not 8! No need to double it. I think I chose very hot chili peppers, as it had a VERY strong BITE and maybe I shouldnt have doubled the chili powder or cayenne.  I kept adding more brown sugar to take away the bite but that didnt work. It was probably the fresh chili peppers.  
It was still EXCELLENT with some sour cream and the "absolute Mexican cornbread"-see review- it was a HUGE HIT!!

It was a little spicy for my taste, even just using one chili pepper.  Next time, I will cut back on the cayenne pepper.

This chili is the absolute best!  My husband is from Texas and it is hard to find a chili hot enough and spicy enough for him, but this one filled the bill. Best tasting chili I have ever had. I used only 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar instead of what was written.  I will make it over and over again. Thank you!!Elaine

Great rich taste. I used Guiness extra stout (bottle w/o widget) and a variety of beans. The chili peppers were hot but after cooking had no sting. I left out the cayanne. Also, I used less than 1/8 c. br. sugar. Thanks to previous reviewers for heads up, (don't forget the extras:onions, sour cream, and cheese!)

This is by far the best chili I've ever eaten.  I  admit was a little leary of putting beer, coffee and cocoa in a perfectly good pot of chili, but I was so surprised at how flavorful it made the chili.  I made a pot one night and took it to work the next day (a snowy day), and it was gone in no time flat.  I had to fight for a bowl of it myself!  Just try it, you'll love it.

I made this on a snowy Saturday night as we had people over to watch a football game.  Everyone loved it!!!  Some people ate with spoons sprinkled with shredded cheddar and some preferred to eat it with tortilla chips!!!  Either way, the best I have ever had!!  I also added about 10 drops of tabasco sauce to heat it up a little more...

This was my first attempt at chili and it was a home run!!! I used half as much brown sugar as suggested and it was perfect. That's why I love this website: being able to read everyone's reviews and suggestions so that you know the recipe will be perfect the first time you make it.

I tried this recipe out on the guys I work with as a test before I made it for Superbowl Sunday. Everyone said it was great, little sweet, but great. I will probably leave out the brown sugar the next time I make it. I used Guiness Extra Stout beer. Very tasty.

Fantastic chili - served it on New Year's Day.  doubled the hamburger and dropped the steak and cut back 1/2 of the brown sugar.  Made a second pot with habanero peppers.  Love the scalable ability of this site - changed it to 15 servings and it worked great!

I made this chili last year for my New Year's Eve soup fest.  It was a rousing success and was requested by my guests to be on the menu again this year.  There are a lot of ingredients so it takes some time to make (especially if you size up the recipe as I did) but it is well worth the work.  It is quite spicy so it is not for the tender tummy, but if you like chili, you will definitely love this one.

This was extremely acidic and hurt my stomach so much I couldn't eat anything for a few days.  The flavor is good-don't put in all the sugar-just don't eat too much.

This is a pretty good chili and it was fun adding all kinds of weird things and having it come out this impressive, but in my opinion, it's still not the ultimate. (I'll let you know when I figure out what that is!) I halved the amount of brown sugar as others suggested, and it was still too much on the sweet side for my husband.

This is amazing!  It is still simmering on the stove as I type this.  I can't get over the complexity of flavors in this.  I cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons and also cut the chili powder to about 2 1/2 tablespoons because I ran out!  I used a Guiness and had the added bonus of drinking the rest of it while I got everything together.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was a little hard to make and took longer than I would have liked but was very good. Next time I will leave out two cans of beans and double the meat.

Yummy and a bit different flavor than traditional chili.  I, too, cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup and will probably cut back even more next time.  I used chili peppers with a rating of 3 but next time will go for a 6 or 7.  Also, NO beans; my boyfriend and I hate them so I used 1.5 lb. of steak tips and 1 lb. of hamburger.  Also will add mushrooms; this is a great base recipe -- I'm looking forward to making it again and playing around it.

I made this chili recipe this weekend and my husband and I LOVED it!  We've eaten it as leftovers twice since I first made it.  My husband thinks that it is the best chili that he has ever had.  Great served with some grated Cheddar on top and cornbread on the side (or as my husband ate it with the chili on top of the cornbread!).  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!

I just won the chili cook-off at my daughters school using this recipe! Just so you know, there were eleven entries. This was the first time I ever made chili. Everyone loved it.  I opted for the 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I slow cooked mine for twice the recommended time. Also, instead of using sirloin I used 7 bone steak cut into pretty small cubes. The meat was very tender. A bit on the meat to bean ratio: I used one less can of beans and twice that of the sirloin, in my case 7 bone steak.  Also, instead of beef broth I used a rich homemade chicken broth. Everything else remained just as the recipe called for. Thanks Robert!

Being from Texas, this chili was a little to sweet for us.  I only added half of the brown 
sugar but I think next time, I will leave it out all together.  It had a great texture,
we all liked the use of ground beef and cubed sirloin.  Overall, it was a good recipe.
Just needed some personal tweaking!  Thanks!

This really is an excellent chili recipe. However, I did cut the brown sugar in half, which I found to be just the perfect amount of sweetness (I don't like it real sweet). Things I will do next time I make it: I used 4 jalapenos, but next time I will not cut out so much of the heat (I like it hot). I will also cut out one can of kidney beans and add celery to the recipe and may use stewed tomatoes instead becuase I like some chunky tomatoes. But definitely a recipe worth keeping!

WOW! The chili is simmering on this perfect fall New England day, does life get any better?  This will definitely become "my" standard chili recipe - a keeper!  I added lime juice, a little molasses and ground dried chipotle pepper to this already complex blend of ingredients and it worked.  Also, cut back on sugar and beans - used 2 19 oz. cans.  Can't wait to serve it to hubby tonight!

This recipe works really well with venison. I used 2 cans of black beans instead though, but still was tasty. Not spicy enough for me, but very user friendly.

This chili is wonderful.  My kids hated chili, unless they tried this chili.  I did cut the sugar, beans and chili peppers in half (because of the little ones). Next time I'll make two batches, one mild and one hot.

I made this one with both Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Guiness and by far my family liked it better with the Sierra.  I used half of the brown sugar and used 2lbs. ground beef with no sirloin.  It was fantastic. I also used only 2 cans of beans, as my family is not that fond of kidney beans.  This tasted AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  My husband begs me to make it all the time!

This is an awesome chili recipe.  I was surprised how well the coffee and brown sugar accented the overall taste.  If you are a chili lover, this is the recipe for you.  I have given the recipe out to all my friends.

This is a great recipe and I will use it again.  It was a little spicy so next time I might not add so many peppers.  I used everybody's suggestions and added half as much brown sugar so it wasn't sweet at all.  Very good.

Great tasting Chili although WAY TOO SWEET.  The overall texture and flavor is outstanding although like I said it is way too sweet.  I'll make this again but I will cut out the Brown Sugar and cut back on the Beans and hot Chili peppers.

This is great chilli.  BEWARE, it is spicy!!!  It does tend to be a little on sweet side as well.  However, the texture and complexity of the the overall taste cannot be beat.  If you want to impress your friends, use this recipe!

Without a doubt the best we have ever eaten. My husband wants it all the time. Would love to freeze it but it doesn't last long enough to do so. I too would cut down on the sugar the next time I make it. I also used a chuck  roast cut into small bitesize pieces in place of the sirloin and it was still delicious!!!

Thanks Robert for a wonderful and very tasty chili recipe!  People can alter it just a little to their likings. I didn't put cayenne pepper, only put 1/4 cup of brown sugar like many other people did, and put two fresh peppers. I put sour cream and grated cheddar cheese on top with corn tortillia chips to dip!

I had made chili before from mom's recipe, which is really great, but decided to give this one a try based on the rave reviews. Instead of two onions I used one green pepper with one large onion. It also seemed like a lot of beans so I used about 2 1/2 cans. I added a little bit more meat, about two pounds, and two chili peppers rather than 4. It came out great...the sirloin steak was a nice addition. Next time I would add over 2 pounds of meat...the chili was not as thick as I would have liked, probably because I cut back on the beans.

I made this recipe for Father's Day and even though it was a hot California day it was devoured.  I was told that it was better than any restaurant chili.  I did use the Guiness Dark Beer and also StarBucks expresso beans.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. Natalie Machado

I made this chili this morning and serverd it to friends for lunch.  I knew when I got all the ingredients together and had a quick taste, that this was the Chili for me!  I could'nt stop tasting it as it progressed to the finish line.  
I did not use the hot chilies, used just ground beef, and  added 1/8th of a cup of brown sugar, and used only 1 can of beans.  I did however add 1/2 cup of diced red, green, and yellow peppers, and a dash of hot crushed peppers to the pot.  I used a German double bock beer, Salvator, and Starbucks Colombian decaf coffee. I garnished it with a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions. 

I enjoyed eating this chili because of the complex layer of flavours that I could detect.

This is the best chili I have ever made.  I can hardly wait to taste it tomorrow after the flavours have melded. 

My friend Tim was here for lunch.  His comments were "we should name this chili, Colombian Chilie, have it Uruguay!"  We had a hoot over that!

I love all things spicy, and really enjoyed this recipe. I used 4 whole fresh jalapenos chopped up and Guiness beer. Loved the flavor! Might be too spicy for some, but we loved it!

I like it, I ate it all, but it's too sweet for my taste.  Tons of brown sugar and cocoa powder.  Good, but I like other chili better.

This was really good!  The last time I made chili, I botched up the recipe really bad, but this time it turned out wonderful.  I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate so I used some regular baking cocoa and a spoonful of shortening and it turned out wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and my dinner guests LOVED it.  I am DEFINITELY going to make this again!  Corrie Sasser :)

I have changed this recipe just a little, I didn't like the sweet taste that the tomato paste
gave to this other wise great recipe so I substuted one 4oz can of tomato sauce,
and one 12oz can of spicy tomato juice, and found it to be more to my liking.

I just made this for a chili cook-off at work and tied for 3rd place (out of 12 entries)! I substituted ground turkey and turkey breast cutlets for the beef and steak, and chicken broth for the beef broth-- no one even seemed to notice. I didn't have quite enough chili powder and used a little less of the green chilis. I also substited half of the canned beans with organic red chili beans that I soaked and cooked ahead of time. It was the spiciest of all the chilis there today. Probably too spicy for most kids.

I cut the recipe in half and only used one can of beans since we are not big fans of beans.  I also used 1 lb. of ground beef since I didn't have the steak.  Turned out great and thickened up nicely for leftovers the next day.  A winner!

While the Chili is *Very* good, i feel the the result of the recipe gives you something with not enough meat and too much beans.  I'd suggest upping the amount of the first, and decreasing the amount of the latter.

*Great* sauce recipe, though.   The cocoa, coffee and beer are interesting ingredients, and add to the appeal of this recipe.

"awesome" - I left out the coriander and the cocoa, but the rest of the ingredients were definitely worth the effort!  Hearty and spicy - A HUGE hit!

I made this for the Superbowl yesterday.  Granted it was only my husband and I, but we both LOVED it!  I have to say it was the best chili I have ever tasted.  I loved the way the remaining two cans of beans were added during the last half hour.  I think that made a big difference in the texture.   And the sirloin chunks were so tender and juicy.  Nice touch.   I can't wait to make this for a group of people.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Bob.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made a pot for my husband to take to work for their chili cookoff and was a little apprehensive of their reaction due to the unusual ingredients.  I shouldn't have worried though, they loved it and my husband brought a very empty pot home.

I have been searching for a hearty filling chili recipe to susbstitute those wick fowler 2 alarm chili packets at the supermarket.  This recipe blew those packets out of the water!!  In the last 3 weeks I have made this three times and my fiancee' and I can't get enough of it on those cold winter nights.  I have substituted the beer for beef bouillon cubes and added a litte more cayenne for extra kick.  This will be in my permanent recipe file.
