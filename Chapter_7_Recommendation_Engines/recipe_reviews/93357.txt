I made one as stated in the recipe so that I could review it honestly (except using a can of Pizza Dough). The rest we had "build your own Calzone" night. I had sauteed mushrooms, canadian bacon, and Italian sausage. For us the meat one was better. I have enough of everything to make myself lunch tomorrow. I will spread the top with garlic butter next time before cooking (the top was hard & dry). Also, mine did not need the whole cooking time. Really easy quick supper.

Delicious! I followed the recipe except for the dough. I used Pillsbury Refridgerated Pizza Dough (one roll made 4 square calzones). It was really yummy & since I didn't have to roll out dough, it was really a quick meal to put together. Near the end of the cook time (it was definitely less than 30 minutes) I brushed egg white on the top to give it that glazed texture.
I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe! I used two packages of spinach and only one egg, my usual garlic/onion powders and Pillsbury pizza dough in the tube instead of the bread dough. It rolled out so nicely too. I brushed the top with egg white and sprinkled with parm and garlic powder. Marinara sauce on the side completed this very pretty picture. Family loved it and thanks!

Wow! Great Recipe guys!! Nice one for the Recipe of the Week! Now, I have made these a few times and I found that they were even BETTER when you added about half a tablespoon of Mayo mixed with a sprinkle of chili powder and chives. TRUST me, It may sound wierd but you WON'T be dissapointed.

These were pretty good.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it in just a little olive oil with mushrooms, garlic, and onion.

I too used the pizza crust which made 4 calzones and cooked in about 20 minutes.  I halfed everything except the spinach and seasonings and added lots of garlic and some diced cooked chicken (because my husband won't eat anything without meat).  It was quick and easy and really good served with some marinara on the side.

I modified this a little bit to get a pretty good dinner set up. I made my own dough in the breadmaker, added onion and garlic powder, as well as an egg yolk to the cheese mixture, and used drained, canned spinach instead of frozen. I liked how these tasted, although I think I might like some meat in them next time.

These were good. The hardest part is working with the dough. The dough needs to be at room temp, it is so much easier to work with when it's not cold.

These were FANTASTIC! I made them with the "Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust" from this site. I can't believe how many I ate... These are now my favourite calzones. The recipe makes a huge amount of filling. I had almost half left over, so DARN! - I had to make more the next day. So delicious!

I don't think this recipe deserves 5 stars as written, but modified it was great! Here's what I did based on other's imput and my own tastes: First of all, I used frozen pizza dough (I just don't like the fakey taste or texture from the Pillsbury refrig. kind). Then for the cheese mixture I cut back and didn't use all of the container of ricotta (others have complained about too much), I added 3 sauteed cloves of chopped garlic that had been sauteed in a bit of olive oil, some chopped up turkey pepperoni (surprisingly good) and 2 Tablespoons of Kraft mayo. I know you're thinking that the mayo sounds gross, but I saw it from another reviewer and it brought to mind a fabulous pizza recipe from the Pampered Chef that contains a little mayo. I cut a small vent/slit on the tops & brushed with olive oil and baked on a pizza stone. They looked beautiful and tasted delicious dipped in pasta sauce (Bertolli's Tomato Basil, my fave). Give this a try - It is great to gather everyone's wisdom & with modifications, this makes a great calzone.

After reading other reviews, I made a few changes to this recipe and it turned out great (meaning my kids actually liked it) and it was pretty fast.  First, I cut the recipe in half.  Instead of buying different cheeses, I skipped the ricotta and just used a 2 cup package of shredded Italian cheeses.  I also added some sauteed onions, garlic, and red pepper to the spinach mixture.  I used way less of the Italian seasoning.  Finally, I bought Pillsbury's thin crust pizza dough instead of bread dough.  I realized that if I unrolled the dough and held it by the edges, it would stretch out on its own.  Then I cut it into rectangles, filled half the rectangle, and folded over.  My calzones weren't in the traditional form, but no one cared.  I brushed the top with olive oil and added a bit of parmesan.  Be careful with the baking time.  My calzones only took about 15 minutes.

I doubled the recipe so we could freeze one calzone for later enjoyment.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T".  Well, almost.  I used frozen pizza dough instead of white bread dough, and made a tomato sauce dipping sauce to accompany the calzone.  Based on other reviewers who said it needed garlic, I added a lot of garlic in the dipping sauce.  Next time, I'll add the garlic to the spinach and ricotta mixture.

These were soo good! Instead of using frozen bread dough I made Emeril's deep dish pizza dough...which you can find on foodtv.com. I made them for dinner last night for some of my friends and they devoured them! Next time I'm going to add some artichoke hearts and some sun-dried tomatoes!

One of my family's favorites now! I like using the fresh bread dough and not the frozen as I found the frozen one rises too much and made the calzones to thick.

These were very good - and so much easier than I thought a calzone would be.  I made half with the spinach and the other half by using diced pepparoni, onion, and green pepper.  Served with marinara sauce for dipping.  Also, like another reviewer, I used the refridgerated pizza dough.  Very good and would make again for a quick Italian dinner during the week.

I made this great, super simple recipe for dinner last night. Like other reviewers, to make it even easier I used the Pillsbury Pizza Dough in a can. I also added sauted garlic & onion, crushed red pepper seasoning & pepperoni pieces to the recipe. Served it with salad & warm sauce. Absolutely excellent! Definately a keeper!

These are so delectable! to be creative, I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a teaspoon of cocoa powder. WOW. It was even better than the original! it sounds pretty weird, I know, but trust me and try it!

Very good. I made a few exceptions. I only used one egg and added a lot of fresh basil. Instead of using frozen spinach, I used fresh, chopped spinach. Added 4 large cloves of garlic. To assemble, put a spoon of sauce on the dough, heaping pile of fresh spinach and two scoops of cheese mixture. Will definitely make again!!

I halved the recipe (just 2 people at home)but did use all the spinach and added soem diced pepperoni.  I used homemade whole wheat bread dough, and brushed them with an egg white wash before baking.  They were crispy and delicious!!  I will definately make these again!

I used pie dough but it worked out well.  I also used only shredded chicken, spinach, riccota, and a touch of evo, as traditional calzones do not have sauce inside.  I will try again but next time with a different dough.

Make sure to roll out the dough pretty thin. Otherwise, there is a lot of dough in each calzone.

These came out delicious.  I followed the recipe exact, except for the dough.  I made my own pizza dough but next time to save time I will buy the store bought dough.  They were really tasty and I even ate the calzone cold for lunch and was really good.  will make again!

I added vegetables to the filling and made some bread dough in my bread machine and this was excellent. A great way to sneak spinach into the family.

These were good - I think that they would be better with the addition of some garlic to the filling. Pretty easy if you don't mind rolling out the dough. Next time I will make sure that I have some marinara sauce on hand, I think that would make them even better!

This is a really good recipe!  I added chicken to it.  I only added about 1/2 of the ricotta cheese.  I also separated the dough into smaller rectangles because when I have made calzones in the past with the dough just cut in half it seemed to be too much dough.  This way turned out perfect.

I make something pretty similar to this, but have a few additions that really make it pop.  1) Decrease the Italian seasoning or skip it completely.  Instead, brush some pesto onto the inside of the dough before you roll it up (store bought Progresso works- cheap and easy).  2) Instead of frozen bread dough, you can buy fresh pizza dough in the cheese or deli section of most grocery stores.  Tastes amazing.  3) Ricotta is optional.  Just the spinach and mozzarella combo with the spinach works great as long as you serve it warm.

I made these calzones for dinner last night and my husband and I both thought they were pretty good. To the filling, I added chopped salami and pepperoni, some red pepper flakes, and I decreased the Italian seasoning by half. Overall, this wasn't one of my favorite calzone fillings(which is too bad, since I had a lot of filling left over), so I probably won't make it again, but I'm glad I gave it a try at least.

Excellent.....used 1 tube of Pillsbury pizza crust, rolled it out and cut into 4 rectangles. Used 1 box of spinach, 3 small cloves of garlic and 1/4 chopped onion (which I sauteed in olive oil, a little nutmeg, 1 c. ricotta, dried basil and oregano, 1 egg and a handful of parm. Filled the four rectangles perfectly with no leftover and then added mozz. cheese to the top of the spinach mixture. Folded over and crimped edges and lightly brushed with olive oil and baked on a silpat on my cookie sheet. Served with my homemade marinara sauce with lots of fresh basil. Family loved these. Also made Giada's recipe for Spicy Tomato Soup on Foodnetwork on the side. Yummy dinner. Great calzones...will try again with real pizza dough and different fillings. Thanks for a great recipe that you can make to taste!

These were amazing!  I added a little bit of cut up pepperoni, because I was feeling a little carnivorous.  I made a meal of these calzones, the "Cheesiest Potato Soup," and Faccacio (spelling?) bread (all from this site).  The Calzones were the best thing involved.  I had a little trouble flattening out the white bread dough, but next time I'll have purchased a rolling pin, and hopefully that will help me.  The recipe makes a LOT of stuffing.  I froze the rest of my stuffing to make more calzones in a few days, I hope it holds up okay in the freezer!

These were very easy to  make.  I used the refrigerated pizza dough for the crust and added a good measure of garlic powder to the spinach/cheese mix.  Very tasty.  Thanks.

Delicious!  I also used pizza crust because I had some in the fridge.  I didn't use spinach, but used pepperoni, mushrooms, green pepper and onions.  These were delicious!  Ranch is also an excellent dipping sauce!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We're big fans of calzones and we love spinach puffs at Greek restaurants, so I figured we'd like these.  I made my own pizza dough and added 3 cloves of garlic.  Then I put a jar of Ragu with some red wine on to simmer while they baked.  They were an excellent dipped in red sauce.  It was a great Sunday night meal that also fed my husband Monday and Tuesday while I was out.

I had a couple friends over for dinner and I decided to use this as a base recipe (with the exception of using pizza dough). I ended up adding some onion and garlic powder in with the mixture as well as chicken and bacon. I also brushed the tops with egg whites when it was close to being done and sprinkled garlic salt on top. And because I'm not the biggest fan of marinara sauce, I provided the choice of marinara or alfredo sauce to dip it in. It was AMAZING! My only complaint was after I added the bacon and chicken, there was far too much. My 2 friends and I each had a large calzone and then I ended up bringing the left overs to my sisters house for a dinner party the next night and we made mini calzones for appetizers. I would say we made at least 20 three inch calzones before running out of pizza dough and I still had quite a bit of filling left. I don't usually cook so I didn't realize how much 3 chicken breasts and some bacon would add to the total amount of filling.

I made 4 large calzones instead of 8. They turned out gigantic and yummy. Two things I would do differently next time is make sure I had some red sauce/marinara for dipping and I would definitely add mushrooms and onions to the mixture. I will also stick to the recipe about making 8 as no one could finish the jumbo versions. This recipe could easily be altered to anyones preference.

I have made these at least 30 times with a few additions to the filling. I add 10 button mushrooms and cook then dice 3 chicken breasts. I place all the ingredients into my food processor and pulse it for about a minute. It ends up being a double batch, but I make 2 batches of pizza dough from my bread machine and after baking it all, I toss the leftovers into the freezer for another meal. I control how big I want them to be.  I once served them as an appetizer, making them really small (although somewhat tedious) but everyone raved. My hubby likes these served with pizza sauce, my kids prefer ranch dressing.  REALLY YUMMY!

Just remember that a calzone is similar to just taking a pizza and folding it in half to eat. Visualizing it that way, I modified this the second time I made it. First time was the exact recipe, but the second time I made these modifications:

- added artichokes, onions, garlic, and mushrooms. 
- added asiago cheese to the mix.
- used THIN pizza crust dough from the grocery instead of the frozen bread dough as recommended in the recipe. Made two large calzones instead of small serving sized versions.

Keep the cheeses and if you want to use marinara sauce, do not put that in the calzone otherwise you risk the dough being too soaked coming out of the oven and it will easily fall apart. If you have leftover filling, this easily freezes in the freezer for use later on!

The filling makes a big batch, so you can use it for a party or freeze what you don't use. We've turned calzone night into a party, everybody rolls out their own dough, adds their own ingredients and we hang out while they're baking. Makes for fun conversation and personality-typing!

Unbelievably Good! I actually made a huge mistake, which thank goodness turned out great. I read the ingredients in the morning and decided to make this for dinner. I didn't see the word "dough" — duh! I thought it said "bread"! So, when it came time to make dinner, I forged ahead with my slices of whole wheat "bread". I rolled each piece out as thin as I could get it. I brushed the edges with an egg wash (added salt & pepper) and filled as per the directions. I placed them on my cookie sheet and brushed each calzone with more egg wash. It turned out great!!! I will definitely make this again, but I will have to decide if I should make the same mistake twice.

Makes too much filling.  Egg once mixed with cheeses does not store well in a fridge for any length of time so if using the egg, mix it as a 2nd mixing stage once you know how much filling you're actually going to use.

Stock recipe sorta bland, this is one to really get creative on, but is a solid base point for making something that when cooked should look awfully similar to a calzone.

Ideas:  Dill? Salt? Gouda? Colby-Jack?  Meats? buttered garlic?  Add just about anything you wanna add into the mix to add an edge to it (The cheeses are mild aka bland) would be my recommendation for other people cooking it.

My husband and I loved this!  I did make some modifications. I scaled this recipe to four servings and with my additions below I had enough filling for 8 servings. Additions: 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder, 2 handfuls of fresh sliced mushrooms, and 1 (2.25oz) can of sliced black olives. I used a (13.5)can of Pillsbury pizza,but should have used two cans because I had a quart of filling leftover. Used an ice cream scooper to dish the filling onto 4 inch circles of dough. I did brush each calzone with olive oil and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  Served with pureed marinara sauce.  Very Yummy!

My husband and I LOVE these calzones!!  I was nervous about making them for dinner as my husband is a meat-guy but he really enjoyed them.  I added a bit of Italian seasonings and used Pilsbury pizza crust.  I brushed the tops of the calzones with melted butter mixed with garlic with gave an extra touch.  The recipe made four huge calzones with extra filling.  I froze the leftover fillings and then used them later stuffed into pasta shells and topped with spagetti sauce (baked covered about 20 min - made enough for 3 people).  This was amazing!!

A friend of mine made these. I asked him for the recipe, he sent me here, and I'm giving it five stars! They had just the right balance of cheese and spinach. My friend made whole wheat dough instead of buy something prepared, and they were fantastic.

I'll give this five stars because my children (ages 5 and 12) both thought they were "yummy" and ate a whole calzone dipped in sauce. That's a green vegy and a red vegy!! As a mom I'm thrilled to get them to eat vegetagles without complaint. I made my own pizza dough in the bread machine, so I had my oven temp on at 375 (400 sounded too high for my oven and I thought the dough would burn). They turned out great. I'll add a bit of fresh garlic next time, too. Does anyone know if these freeze well either prepared but not baked or after they have been baked? Thank you for the recipe!!

I'm not a big fan of calzones (I usually find the bread too much) but I am a big fan of spinach. I'm giving this a 5 because I discovered it is just as wonderful WITHOUT any bread. I didn't have crescent rolls or frozen bread dough on hand, so used pizza dough instead. I also didn't resize the dough, just added more filling and cut them in half for 2 servings. I did add extra spinach (did I mention I love spinach?) Had some filling left over so put serving sizes into custard cups, cover loosely with foil and baked along with the others.  Perfect! My brother loved it with the bread - I loved it without!

I was out of ricotta so I used large curd cottage cheese & when they were nearly done baking they burst & spilled out on the pan (but that crispy, cheesey stuff was tastey!).  Brushed them with garlic butter & coarse salt prior to baking & we dipped ours in jarred spaghetti sauce thickened with 2 TBs of tomato paste, WOW!  fast dinner, fattening & tastey.

This was average.  My husband didn't like it at all.  I thought it was okay, but a bit bland, even when served with marinara sauce.  If I made it again, I would definitely add garlic and perhaps some sauteed onion and/ or bell peppers.

This was pretty good, at least the men in my family liked it a lot. I made my own dough, used low fat ricotta and only used one scant tablepoon of Italian seasoning which we felt was plenty for us.  Good recipe!

I made these with frozen bread dough, sauteed fresh spinach and added 4 cloves fresh garlic and a small onion sauteed. Tossed in some red pepper flakes and crumbled italian turkey sausage. Left out the ricotta cause I didn't have it handy, then wrapped each one with a few sliced roasted hot peppers. Yum gave it a four because I altered it so much.

We loved these versatile calzones.  I added black olives and canadian bacon, but the options are endless.  The filling oozed out of mine.  Maybe I filled them too full, or didn't seal the edges enough.  They were still fabulous.  I used my favorite pizza dough recipe and we dipped them in pizza sauce.

My family and I love this recipe.  The only change I made is using two pre-made pizza crusts instead of the bread dough.  I have made this recipe several times and you can halve the recipe by halfing the cheeses.  We top them with warm spaghetti sauce right before eating.  They have tuened out great every time for me.

Okay.  I made them with pizza dough and added crushed red pepper.  They were satisfying and fairly no-hassle to prepare, so I'll probably make them again, but may try adding some more ingredients next time.  Seems like a recipe kids would love.

I made this for me and my bf, I ended up with a lot of extra filling so I baked it in a custard dish.  I made my own pizza dough from scratch  Mix 1 packet of yeast 1 teaspoon of sugar 1 cup of water (let sit for 10 min)  1 Tablespoon of olive oil 1 teaspoon of salt 3 cups of flour  Let rise for 1 hour then follow the recipe as above.  Turned out great.  I also had a can of diced tomatoes simmer for the baking time and added some oregano and basil for dipping.  I was out of canned marinara.

Giving this four instead of five b/c I doctored up the filling a bit. I added sauteed garlic, onions, mushrooms, and pepperoni to the spinach and cheese mixture. Used Pillsbury's frozen pizza dough, per another reviewer's recommendation. Brushed an egg wash over the calzones before popping them in the oven for about 20 minutes. They looked and tasted great. Really easy, fun, tasty dish.

I actually used Pillsberry crescents instead of white bread! It worked great! It only cooked for about 20 minutes!  You should cook it until the tops are a deeper brown, that way the bottoms get done perfectly! We actually paired this with a homeade fettucini! Delicious!

My entire family, aged 18 months to 29+ loved this recipe.  I used canned pizza dough and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  This was easy and delicious.  An earlier reviewer suggested brushing egg whites on top, and it did add a nice shiny glaze to the calzone.  This one is a great master recipe for a calzone.  I can't wait to make it again.

spinach mixture was great.  we even personalized a few for the kiddos (turkey pepperoni, sausage, feta - etc) - the issue is with the dough.  very thick as it is a bread - so if you can't get it rolled thin enough - you end up wasting most of the finished product to get to the good stuff.  would be best with home made dough - but all in all good concept - not an easy throw together weekday dinner.  this one takes some prep and good amount of clean up (dough, flour, etc).

These were wonderful and very quick to mix up.  I used pizza dough as some suggested.  I've always added a pinch of nutmeg to ricotta mixtures, so did so in this case as well.  Lovely.  Will try some of the variations suggested.

I gave it 2 stars because they were vey nice looking, but the taste was very bad. The cheeses were too bland and the overpowering flavor was the italian seasoning - way overpowering flavor. I used the freezer bread dough like the recipe called for and you really have to seal the edges good or they'll pop open while cooking. I would recommend doing an egg white wash on the tops before baking. The filling just wasn't good.

These were tasteless and unedible. After spending hours making them I ended up trowing the whole batch in the trash.

I've never made calzones before.. so, I was nervous going in. I added a tablespoon of chopped garlic. The calzones turned out lovely. Looked very presentable. My boyfriend suggested adding Italian sausage. Along with another reviewer, I think adding mushrooms would be phenomenal. Just need to find your own taste preference. Overall, I loved this recipe and will definitely be making it again.

These were pretty good.  I agree with other reviewers that they were a bit bland and could use some garlic and onion salt.  Instead of the frozen bread dough, I used jiffy pizza crust mix (I box for 2 calzones).  I also added pepperoni.  Even after brushing the calzones with olive oil, the crusts got crunchy, so I would suggest being very generous with the application.

These were really great!  My whole family liked them.  I used refrigerated pizza dough and I used 3T fresh mixture of oregano, basil, garlic chives and thyme and 1T dried Italian seasoning and I thought that was right on with the spices.  I also cut up a spicy brat and added that to the mix which was really good. And I added 1/2T mayo and a dash of hot pepper sauce like other reviewers suggested. I like pizza dough spread really thin on these, otherwise they seem to bready to me.

We loved these! I added chopped tomato to some of them. Wouldn't recommend it as the liquid would allow the dough to seal.

REVISED: I made these once before and my husband wasn't crazy about them; he said they tasted too much like ricotta cheese.  However, I made them again for myself and the kids and whaddya know, they were delicious!  All four kids gobbled them up!  I made them just as the recipe stated with the addition of sauteed onion and garlic. Turns out it's just my husband who's crazy.

Very good!  I followed the recipe quite closely and it turned out great for my first time trying Calzones.  I'm glad I read the other reviews because 20 minutes was definately enough and the brush with garlic butter kept it from getting hard. This is a keeper!

I'm not sure if they were unbelievable, but they were very tasty indeed.  I used frozen pizza dough, my pizza spice grinder instead of the Italian seasoning and 1 1/2 tbs mayo, like another reviewer suggested.  I also sauteed some mushrooms in butter and a dash of garlic powder.  Brushed the tops with melted butter. I did have a difficult time shaping the pizza dough, so they weren't a beautiful presentation, but delicious anyway!  I was able to get 12 calzones out of the filling.  Dipped in homemade spaghetti sauce.  We will definately be putting this recipes into rotation- my kids LOVED it, my husband loved it and I really enjoyed it too.  very easy for a busy night, if you have everything frozen ahead of time.

Our local "pizza guy" is going to be very upset because he just lost my family's standing order for no fewer than 10 of his calzones each and every week. I made these last night for dinner, following the recipe exactly (except I brushed the tops with olive oil and adjusted the fillings to accommodate family member preferences: I like spinach, my husband likes ham, my boys pepperoni and my daughter requested sausage; I will definitely experiment with other stuffings in the future). In my family, it's all about the cheese, and the proportions indicated here were near PERFECT for our purposes. Slitting the tops before baking was a great suggestion, and made for an attractive presentation. In addition, I was VERY (and most pleasantly) surprised when I compared my cost to make these vs. the price we USED to pay to have them delivered (less than $25 vs. approx. $75 -- when you include taxes and tip). I always thought calzones should be easy to make, but for some reason, it never crossed my mind they could be baked in anything but a pizza oven. My infrawave oven cooked 2 at a time in 22 minute "sessions" so I simply reheated the 4 I had cooked first in my microwave before serving (with cups of marinara sauce, ranch and blue cheese dressings as side accompaniments). A real keeper of a recipe. I believe I will be making these AT LEAST once a week from now on.

These were ok, a little bland, next time I will add garlic or nutmeg to the filling. I do love the taste of the spinach. I made my own pizza dough and there was just enough filling for 8 calzones. Nothing really exciting and I am not sure if I would make again. Used all fresh cheeses.

I just made these tonight, and the family loved them.  A few changes I made were using homemade pizza dough, adding some garlic salt, oregano, and cut-up pepperoni.  I also put some shallow slits on the top, and brushed the tops with olive oil and sprinkled with a little sea salt.  Will be making again soon!

I think this recipe is a good base for a great calzone.  I served with generic pasta sauce from Supertarget and it was really good overall.  I halved the recipe since it's only the hubby and me and made the recipe almost exactly as written, except I added pepperoni to add more flavor.  With that said, next time I'll reduce the amount of italian seasoning a bit (thought it was really strong), reduce the amount of ricotta cheese and add more mozarella cheese.  I will also add a clove a garlic, dice up the pepperoni and add some onions and/or mushrooms. Great recipe though to alter and adapt to your own personal preferences!!

I followed the recipe with a few minor modifications.  I used Pillsbury Pizza Dough.  I wanted to make small    ones, so I cut out 5 inch circles and was able to get 6 or 7 from each roll of dough. I scaled the recipe to make 12 servings and used 1 and half rolls of dough and still had a bunch of filling leftover.  I brushed the tops with an egg wash and sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese   before baking.  They came out great, although when I make then again I will probably add some garlic powder and some additional seasonings. I also made Quick Sausage and Pepper Calzones from this site and served with warmed spaghetti sauce.

My boyfriend LOVED this.  I used the pizza dough, onions, and garlic powder as suggested.  I also added chicken since he won't eat something without meat.  It was a huge hit.  Only made 4 with the pillsbury pizza dough, so I have a lot of the filling left.  I'd recommend cutting the recipe down to 4  or 5 servings if you end up using the dough, or just buying two tubes.

The cheese blend is excellent! It gets a little intense when it's in too big of chunks, but when we added Italian sausage, onions, and mushrooms, the flavors came out in a very pleasing combination.

Quite good - also bought Pillsbury pizza crust (which was ok - a little like crescent rolls so might try another one next time). Forgot the parmesan and felt really stupid.  This needs some dipping sauce - I had leftover spaghetti sauce and that really elevated this recipe from great to incredible.

Good! I added 8 oz sauteed mini bella mushrooms to this and used low fat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta.  I also put some turkey pepperoni in some of the calzones.  Before baking, brush with olive oil and sprinkle some fresh crushed garlic on top for a delicious garlic flavor!

Nice basic recipe to get you started in the right direction.  I used a can of pizza dough as another reviewer suggested.  I also added cooked chicken, marinara sauce and sauteed mushrooms and onion.  It was the additions to the recipe that made my family love it.

this recipe is very easy.  I made homemade white bread dough instead of the refridgerated dough pkg.  I think the filling could us a bit more...maybe artichoke hears, or chicken pieces.

These calzones were pretty easy to make and tasted good.  Mine needed less bake time (the tops got too hard and brown for my liking) and next time I'll add meat/other toppings to the filling.

Filling is a little bland but a good, flavorful dipping sauce helps.  Next time I'll try adding some red pepper flakes to it. Also recommend brushing them with olive oil before baking for a nice brown crust.

Just made these for dinner tonight.  YUMMY!  Made exactly as the recipe stated except used sausage and pepperoni instead of spinach (didn't have any).  Added a side of pizza sauce topped w/cheese on the side for dipping.  My family loved every bit of it!!

These are really easy and fast.  I'm giving it a four only because I felt it needed more flavor and added more seasoning than the recipe called for, but thats a personal preference thing and I will definitely be making these again! Thanks :)

My kids ate them! I would have liked if they had a little more flavor. But, I will still make them again. I love how easy they are!

So good!  I didn't have any ricotta cheese on hand so I unfortunately had to omit it.  I added a little crushed red pepper and some cooked mild italian sausage (for my meat eating men) and used fresh pizza dough the first time I made these.  The second time I used Pillsbury pizza dough as suggested by a few other reviewers.  It was easier, but I didn't like it as much.  Great recipe!

Except it was a pain dealing with the pizza crust I used - too stretchy.  I had way too much filling also.

Loved this! I went a little easy on the mozza and Parm cheeses to make it more healthy, but I'm sure it would be even better if I hadn't. I added 2 chopped roma tomatoes and a cup or so of chopped fresh mushrooms. I also used one egg instead of two and didn't miss anything. Needs just a pinch of salt. My hubby and toddler went to town on this! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this with a pizza dough recipe.  I added chopped red bell pepper and cooked chicken to the filling - I only made 1/2 the filling recipe and it made 5 calzones.  Turned out very nice.  Will definitely use this one again - very amenable to tweaking.

These were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  It was a great way to use up some spinach and get the flavor I was craving without going through all the time lasagna requires.

These were really easy to make and tasted very good. I used my pizza dough recipe for my bread machine to make the dough.  My husband thinks they would be even better with chicken - although we enjoyed them as they were!

My kids had "build your own calzone" night. I too used pizza crust and brushed egg over the top. I also used fresh spinach which I sautéed in olive oil and garlic. I found some organic (chicken) Italian sausage and pan fried that to go in the calzones. I followed the recipe for the cheese filling and had my kids help mix it. This was a really fun and easy dinner to make!

Really tasty!  I used 2 tubes of ready made pizza dough and baked for 25 min.  Next time I would use more spinach, less ricotta and only 1 egg.  It was a little too quiche like for me.  My guys loved them!

I made these into bite-sized calzones.  I had about half of the mixture leftover, so I would suggest doubling the amount of white bread dough to use all of it.  I also baked it for half of the time.  Add some marinara for dipping and you're good to go!

I used pre-made pizza dough, which made it super easy and they were yummy!  I would probably coat the top with butter as another reviewer suggested since they do turn out a bit hard on top.  Definitely didn't need 30 minutes cook time; as it was, the cheese was running out... So good though!

I didn't realize the recipe called for 2 lbs of dough; I had only bought 1 lb, but everything still came out fine. I made one long (log) calzone, and the top/middle was busting at the seams, but of course it didn't change the taste and just made it look that more appealing. I also added garlic powder to the filling but that would be optional to someone else.

Very good, very easy-my kind of cooking. ;o) Tried the pizza crust and it worked perfectly. The elasticity of the dough let it stretch easily without tearing. Thank you, Wheatfields, for the delicious filling. Thank you, reviewers, for the pizza crust suggestion.

I really waned to like these, but I found them nothing special. I made them using the whole wheat and honey pizza dough recipe from this site instead of the canned dough the recipe calls for, but I doubt it made that much difference. I don't think I'll make these again.

My kids (age 5,7) actually made these with a little help! We forgot the parmesan cheese and only had 1 TBS italian seasoning left and they still came fanstastic. I would probably stick with the 1 TBS seasoning as any more might have been too much. Great way to sneak little spinach in their diet! We added pepperoni to half of them and we sprayed the tops with a little butter spray about 10 min before they were done. Next time will try with sausage and mushrooms.

This is such an easy recipe! I agree it needed some extra spice: I used more Italian seasoning and some garlic salt. I saved one egg white and brushed it and extra garlic salt on the tops of the calzones before baking. Great recipe to share with my vegetarian roommate!

Being a poor college student, I made some substitutions and they still turned out incredibly delicious! I put in one package of softened cream cheese instead of ricotta, which I know is no proper substitution, but it made the mix creamy like it needed to be, and it turned out yummy! Also, I used powdered parmesan, which works if you don't have the grate-able stuff on hand. And then I added the garlic salt and onion powder as well as cooked, cubed chicken. I brushed the outside with butter and sprinkled with parmesan, as someone else said. My husband told me we need to make these again really soon!

This makes a lot of filling--maybe too much.  I added 1 T of Italian seasoning and 3 cloves of garlic to the filling.  I brushed an olive oil, salt, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder combo onto the tops of the calzones, and then sprinkled parmeasan cheese over it.  Baked them on a pizza stone. 4.5 stars.

delicious!  I did an egg wash on top and sprinkled with kosher salt and a little shredded parm.  Ours were perfectly done after 26 minutes.  For dipping, I made a sauce by pureeing 1 small sized can of plum tomatoes with a clove of garlic and some italian seasoning, then simmered while the calzones cooked.  Delicious!

I used homemade pizza dough ("Pizza Dough II"), and in this case, the less-browned ones were better than the well-browned ones. I think the freshness of people's Italian seasoning makes a difference-- I opened a fresh bottle and 1 and 1/2 tbsp. of seasoning was plenty to me.

Fantastic - family loved it.  I used whole wheat dough from the bakery at the supermarket (healthier).  I substitued green peppers for spinach on my daughter's request.  I would like to try to spinach next time.  I served heated sauce on the side to dip cut up pieces in.  Yum, yum :)

This recipe is simply delicious. I did end up using pizza dough (the thick crust kind)  thanks to the tips of other. Before serving I poured marinara sauce on top and it was so tasty. Next time I think that I will use less Italian seasoning because it was quite strong. The cooking time was only about 20 minutes.

We tried this the other night.  I used the breadmaker to make whole wheat pizza dough for the bread part.  They were great!  I was estimating the spinach and the ricotta because the containers I bought were larger than the recipe called for.  It seemed it could've used a bit more spinach.  Other than that it was great!

My family loved this recipe! Especially my kids. My daughter actually went back for seconds, which she never does! The only thing I did different was use fresh chopped spinach. Thanks for a wonderful recipe and great way to get the kids to eat a green veggie.

The basic idea of this is good. I didn't like the spinach so I am going to try it with other things mixed in (ham, green peppers and pineapple).

A great recipe - loved it. I added 1/3 cup of feta cheese to the filling and reduced the same amount of ricotta. A local bakery sells frozen pizza dough (about 24 ounces each). I defrosted one, and cut it into 6 pieces - it was a delicious crust for the calzone. It sealed well (I crimped the edges with a fork) and it wasn't too ' bready.' I used  about 1/2 cup of filling on each calzone - I still have quite a bit left over - I'm going to use it to make turnovers with some phyllo dough leftover from another recipe.

Very good recipe! I used Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust instead of the frozen bread dough and I like the texture that you end up with. Other additions that I recommend would be a dash of garlic powder (to taste) and any other good additions to the filling that you have around (black olives, mushrooms, etc). Very good meal to pull together rather quickly when you want something filling and comforting.

I thought this was a very quick and easy recipe. I only made 2 small modifications. I used 2 cans of Pillsbury pizza dough instead of making my own dough. I also added a layer of Canadian bacon slices on top of the spinach/ ricotta mixture. My husband loved this one.

Great tasting recipe.  I used the 10 oz. package of frozen spinach and the loaf of frozen bread, but halved the rest of the ingredients, and ended up with just a large amount to fill the 8 pieces of dough.  The dough was easy enough that my seven year old granddaughter rolled out the eight pieces of dough.  She really enjoyed herself and was very proud that she was able to do it.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe. Did not have spinach so I subbed it with broccoli. Very good. Will make again with pepperoni and cheese and get pizza sauce for dipping. Thanks for the great recipe.

I'll admit I changed this up a lot to suit our personal tastes, but the results were great!  Added meat and onions, and omitted some of the cheese.  Brushed the top with garlic butter for some added flavor.. We'll make this again and again!

Yummy! First time making calzones and it went well. I added some hot italian sausage, yellow squash, mushrooms and it was excellent. I like the ease with the premade dough but I had a hard time rolling it out. Maybe it was me but everytime I rolled the dough out it would bounce right back to it's tiny little shape. I also did not need to cut into 8 pieces only 4.  Just for fun, I put marinara sauce in one calzone. It was good with and without it. Also I brushed some buttery garlic on top before baking. YUMMMMMMMY!

This was very good. I cut the recipe in half and it made 4 good-sized calzones. I think there's a typo with the amount of Italian seasoning to use.  I used 1 teaspoon and it was just right.  I also used the Pillsbury pizza crust (in the dairy section) and it worked great.

This recipe was delicious but the white bread dough was very difficult to work with. I'm not sure if it was the brand I bought or what. But the outcome was really tasty. Instead of ricotta I used cottage cheese for a lighter alternative, and it didn't seem to take away from the calzones at all. The second night when we ate the leftovers, my husband thought it was "too much spinach" but he still ate it all. They need to be dipped in marinara for the best flavor.

Pretty good made following the recipe (somewhat dry), but it was way better the second time I made it--added more cheese (mixture of chedder/jack, and extra mozzarella) and a package of cream cheese.

Love this recipe. I did cut the italian seasoning down by half.
Try making with cottage cheese because Hailey doesn't like ricotta cheese.
I also bought the pizza dough in the dairy isle at P&C

With a few minor changes this recipe is AWESOME. I used canned pizza dough, cut the cheeses way down & added more veggies (bell pepper, mushroom, onion) and spices to the mix. Very hearty & yummy.

This was a good starter recipe.  I was worried that it wouldn't be flavorful enough so I added sauteed garlic, mushrooms and onions to the mixture.  I also used regular fresh pizza dough.  I brushed the calzones with egg and garlic powder for extra flavor.  I will make these again.

These were great, I've made them twice in the past week. I used cottage cheese because I like the taste better, pre-made pizza dough, a lot of fresh spinach and I brushed the calzones with egg whites before baking them. I froze a couple unbaked to have for later and they turned out just as good.

These are delicious. I used fresh mozzarella and they came out great. Next time, maybe stuff them little less as most of the calzones leaked while baking.

This was ok.  My husband loved them.  I followed other reviews and used pillsbury pizza crust, that was good.  I did not like the filling.  I also followed other reviews and added saute'd onion and garlic, I thought that was very strange in a calzone, next time I will just add onion and garlic spice.  I  would also use less ricotta and more mozzerella.

Didn't like the frozen bread dough. It was flat and not fluffy like I'd hoped for. Added pepperoni but could've used a little more flavor. Garlic,onion,other veggies would've been nice.I did like the mixture though, it just need "more".

YUMMY!  I made these for my Bunko girls and they loved them (Hubby did too)!  I also added mushrooms and garlic and used canned pizza dough as recommended by previous reviewers.  DELISH!

Yum! What a quick, easy recipe! I incorporated the suggestions of others  adding mayo, chili powder and fresh garlic to the spinach mixture and brushing the tops with butter and garlic. I also used pillsbury biscuts, which tasted great but did not hold much stuffing and tended to unwrap. Thanks for the great tips everyone!

I did not have frozen dough so I used Pillsbery pizza dough which was quick and easy.  I covered the calzones with tin foil for the first 15 min so that they would not get too brown and I cooked Italian pork sausage with chopped onion and then added it to the stuffing for more flavor.  I served them with spaghetti sauce on the side for dipping and they were a hit!

I made one without salt and pepper because I wasn't sure of the flavor profile, but it was great. I couldn't find frozen bread or pizza dough, so I used canned biscuits (one for the top and on for the bottom). It came out really well! 
I made one as the instructions state, and look forward to trying it with everyone's modifications.

Im sorry, but this dish wasn't that good. Everyone in my family disliked this meal. It was took much trouble to make this dish, and then finding out it, that this dish wasn't even that good. I forced myself to eat this dish so that my mom didn't get up about wasting good. I was begging for dish to be finished already. My mom even tried putting ham in it and it still wasn't very tasty. I'm kinda of a vegetable lover and I do like spinach, but this meal was nasty and hard to make.

This was a very good filling.  The changes I made were to sauté Italian sausage, drain and cool.  Next I mixed the ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan with a wooden spoon in a bowl, next added the eggs.  I mixed this well and added half of a head of fresh spinach.  I found the frozen to be too watery.
Once the sausage was cool I spread it to the bottom of the calzone then covered it with the cheese mixture.  Next I sealed the calzone and proceeded with the cooking instructions,  I covered it with Chef John's tomato sauce and it was delicious!

Overall pretty good. The amount of italian seasoning called for is a bit much. I added chopped chicken as someone suggested, which was a good addition. I also used 2 cans of pizza dough, which cuts down prep time. I only baked for 25 min.

Really solid recipe for how quick and easy it is. I made it for dinner and had the leftovers the next day on a plane trip. They were still great room temp. This would be a successful lunch box item.

very good recipe- i did make a slight adjustment adding sausage and using a refrigerated pizza roll, but followed everything else as stated. after some effort, was able to coax a 5 year old to try it despite the "green stuff" and it disappeared within minutes. used excess dough to make breadsticks. served with a cucumber & tomato salad. delish :)

5 stars for this one because it's extremely simple to make and tastes great. Simplicity is one of my biggest factors when it comes to cooking dinner. We ate this with Ragu sauce. Next time I will cook these a little longer, as mine were doughey in spots.

These were wonderfully delicious! I made them, exactly as stated in the recipe, to take to a homebound family, and they raved about them.  Couldn't wait to get the recipe!  I did have some leftover filling, so the next night I used the Pillsbury Pizza Dough as per Ellie's review from 3/07, and my husband loved them also.  I'll definitely use the refrigerated pizza dough next time, as the only hard part for me was rolling out the bread dough with my arthritic hands.

Wonderful.  My hubby gave it a 'thumbs up'.  My kids (twin 6 year olds, 4 year old &18 monthold) all ateevery bite.  The flavor was perfect for our taste.  We used a marinara sauce for dipping.  It did require plenty of planning ahead- it took all day for the frozen loaf to rise- next time I may try the premade pizza crust.  The kids were all amazed to see a rolling pin in action.  It was a family affair for this dinner.  I brushed the calzones with a beaten egg- they looked beautiful when done.  I can't wait to make it for guests.

I really liked these calzones, but instead of bread I used crescent rolls so it wouldn't be so much bread to eat.  It turned out great.  I also added pesto to the mix. Will make again.

Awesome recipe!  Everyone in the family just loves it.  It does take quite a bit of prep time, but well worth it.  I made a double batch and froze them; making it an easy after school meal.

Love it! The only alteration I made was using jarred Classico Pesto for extra flavoring - about 1/4 or so. Makes it real good. We also top with sphagetti sauce.
Thanks, great recipe.

We didn't care much for these. If I made them again, I would add something more to the filling. Proscuitto, Ham, or Chicken for example. I think this filling is better off in a pasta shell.

These were pretty good.  I halved the filling and used 1 thawed loaf of frozen white bread dough (make sure it is room temperature, so it's easy to work with).  I only used about 0.5 tsp of Italian seasoning (could have omitted it totally), and added some garlic powder.    It was just perfect to make 4 calzones.  We thought the balance of spinach/cheese was just right.  Made great leftovers, too!

Not very good, unless you LOVE the taste of "dried Italian Seasoning".  I would reduce that spice by at least 50% and add anything else....garlic, onion, pepperoni.  Tomato sauce for dipping was a must because it had very little taste. Also, there was way too much filling for the amount of bread dough the recipe called for.

Yummy. Used extra moz and pizza dough. Served with homemade marinara. Had waaaaay too much filling leftover, so we made a spinach pizza--it was delicious too!

Yummy. I used whole wheat frozen bread and it was ok, next time I'll try my pizza dough around it. Definately needs extra garlic!

This recipe is a keeper! Very tasty, even the kids enjoyed them. I used fresh spinach and added 1TBL. minced garlic to the mixture. For the dough I used Jiffy Pizza Crust Mix (4-boxes). Also served them with little cups of pizza sauce for dipping as suggested.

At first taste they are pretty good, but after a while the spinach are ricotta gets to you.  I would like to try this recipe again with a smaller filling-to-dough ratio.  Also, maybe with something to add to the filling such as pepperoni or bacon bits.

My DH made these calzones for dinner tonight and they were fabulous...but he did change some things.  Here is what he did: added about 3 Tbsp of miracle whip, 1 tsp chili powder (could have used more), 1/2-1 tsp each garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper.  We also used "light" ricotta and part skim mozarella, but we both felt as though the amount of all three cheeses could have been reduced a lot.  Lastly, we used pillsbury pizza dough instead of frozen bread dough.  The end result was really, really yummy...but we had A LOT of spinach filling left over because we only made 4 calzones, but this filling would be really good for homeade ravioli or manicotti, so I froze half of the filling for later use.

I loved this recipe except that I like a home made dough.  So, I used one from another recipe..combined the 2 and am more than satisfied!  These are so great because you can vary the filling to whatever you are craving!  thanks

Very forgiving recipe!  I lessened the ricotta cheese because I hate ricotta, and doubled the parmesan and mozarella.  I also sauteed an onion and a carton of mushrooms and added that into the filling.  I ran out of pizza dough and so I filled squares of refrigerated crescent dough.  Also a couple slits in the top will keep the calzones from bursting.  My husband loved this!

This was pretty good. I added fresh garlic and used low fat ricotta as well as refrigerated pizza crust. I made 4 good size calzones from this and still had a lot of filling left over (which I froze).  I wasn't crazy about the pizza dough so I think next time I will make my own dough, something that has a little more flavor.  We did dip in spaghetti sauce.  Delicious.

I topped the calzones with some tomato-mushroom sauce!  MMmmm...it turned out delicious, but be sure to top them with the sauce.
