These are really delicious! As my cookies were palm size big each, one was enough to fill. I love the molasses taste in the dough. My husband loved them; although one was enough, he ate 3 at once! My dough wasn't smooth enough and I added 3 tablespoons of yoghurt water. I also used less butter and some olive oil to make it healthier. Thanks for the 5 star recipe.

Super yummy cookies! these are like date squares in a cookie form. 
I scaled  the recipe to 12 servings to use 1 cup of butter, which yielded 29 cookies using a 2 1/4" cutter. 
I changed the method to creaming the butter and brown sugar, then adding in the salt, baking soda, molasses and eggs, beating again then stirring in the flour and rolled oats by hand with a spoon.. I only used 1/4 tsp of salt, 2 tsps is way too much. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. 
This dough is too soft to roll out, I put it between 2 sheets of parchment paper which worked like a charm, then placed in the freezer while I made the date filling. When the dough was more solid it cut easily and I was able to use the scraps to roll out again.
For the date filling, I omitted the walnuts and used all dates for both amounts, I halved the sugar and used orange juice for the water, I needed more juice as it was too dry while cooking down, I aslo added 1/4 tsp orange zest. I made this recipe for Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless

Good cookie, very heavy and filling.   They were not the easiest to roll out, I think using quick oats would have made rolling easier than the large flake I used.  They took me a long time to put together and I don't think I would make them again.

My daughter and I have to be careful with these cookies! One day, we each had SIX and mine were a lot bigger than pictured! They are sooo rich and delicious without being sugary sweet. I got tired of rolling and cutting them, so last time I just made then as bars. Press 1/2 the dough in a greased 7x11 inch pan. Cover with date mixture and the other 1/2 of the dough. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes or until slightly brown and puffing up a little. If using a 9x11 pan, I'd reduce baking time to 15 minutes or so.  GREAT recipe--thanks Carole!
