This was lunch for the kids today--I made two sandwiches. I used a little more cream cheese and (homemade) strawberry freezer jam. The kids loved them. My oldest boy asked if he could have another when he finished his first.

Wow! This was "Berry Good" and a complete departure from the typical "PB&J" sandwich I'm used to having. I gave it a try for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. I toasted the whole grain bread first and it had a nice light crunch which was complimented by the sweetness of fresh fruit. Very easy and very tasty! Next time I might even add in a little sliced banana or try different fruit and jam combinations.

Yummy sandwich!  I made some substitutions for what I had on hand (full calorie cream cheese, regular whole wheat bread, raspberry jam instead of strawberry).  It was really "berry good"!  I guess it's true, nobody doesn't like Sara Lee!

The perfect bridal shower or cocktail sandwich.  I made these using whole wheat bread, and spreading some cream cheese on each side, with thinly sliced strawberries in the middle.  I used a large flower cutter as big as the bread, then cut them in half, assembling them in full flowers on the plate.  Everyone raved, and they were the first item gone....even a toddler there with his mother loved them.  A definte keeper, and perfect with cucumber sandwiches for a light sweet alternative sandwich.

Made this for my little guy for breakfast this morning and he LOVED it! I used whipped cream cheese and white bread that I toasted because that's what I had. I tasted it and thought it was great too! This will definately be made again! Thanks for sharing. :)
