This is a fabulous cheesecake recipe, but I wanted to warn all those low-fat junkies out there that this recipe should not be modified.  I made it once as directed (except used Oreo crumbs for the crust, which I highly recommend) and it turned out perfectly - tasted amazing!  I made it a second time with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was really disappointing.  I'm usually all for low-fat modifications because often you can't really tell and it makes sweets a lot healthier, but resist the temptation here.  It just doesn't taste right and the texture is off.  Go all out on this if you're going to make it.  And do make it because you will seriously impress your friends and family.

WOW, If i could, I would give this recipe 10 stars. I made it for a church function last night, and I had people coming up to me all night telling me how fabulous it was, one girl scraped the bottom of the platter and showed me she had to o that just to get a taste. another man ate his, and his wife's peice, and tried to steal some one elses! I must have said thank you 100 times.  I  Used chocolate graham cracker for the crust, milk chocolate intead of semi-sweet, and baked it in  a water bath. I was perfect. I cut it first into slices ( so it would be easier to serve) then I melted  some more caramel, and some chocolate and alternates swirling them over the cut peices, which worked out nicely becuase it oozed down into the slices and made it taste even yummier, and It looked prettier than if I had to cut it already decorated!   thnak you so much for this reipe, definetly making this again!!

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious!! The caramel layer was not hard, as some "turtle" type cheesecakes get, I followed the recipe exactly, making sure the ingredients were at room temperature. I baked in a 325 oven for exactly 50 mins. with a 9" cake pan full of hot, boiled water on the oven rack  beneath the rack the cheesecake was on.  The cheesecake had a 2-3" wobbly circle, in the centre at this point.  I turned my oven off, cracked the door open and left it for a good 4-5 hours until it was completely cool.  It set up beautifully, with NO cracks.  I then transferred it to the fridge, and decorated it the next day with sweetened whipped cream that I had added some whip cream stabilizer to.  I also sprinkled the piped cream with some chopped pecans, and added a cherry on top of each dollop of cream.  To cut, I ran hot water on the knife, and wiped it off between each cut.  It cut beautifully!!  I served it with some Smucker's caramel sauce.  Delish!! My sil absolutely loved it!! (i made it for her 40th b-day)

I've made many cheesecakes, but this certainly cracks the top three! The recipe is relatively easy and a cinch to alter to make it your own. I used the Nestle chocolate/caramel swirl chips and as always, substituted a can of Dulce de Leche (La Lechera) for the caramels. Using La Lechera gives you the same results but in a fraction of the time. The cheesecake was rich and creamy-- a big hit!

This is a great cheesecake!  Cheesecakes are so hard to get perfect-make sure cream cheese is at room temperature, along with the eggs!  If you do get tiny lumps, they don't ruin the cheesecake; it's just not as pretty.  Make sure your crust doesn't have any leaks for the caramel layer to go through, or you'll have a hard time getting the pie out of the pan!  I will probably pour the caramel over the top when serving instead next time.  The caramel is chewy in the crust, something some people may not like.  Excellent recipe!

This was the first time I've ever made a "real" cheesecake and it was a big hit!  It wasn't too difficult, but I did make a few changes...I made my crust out of Oreo crumbs instead, and I would say it needs more caramel for the layer over the crust (maybe 50 caramels instead, because you could hardly see the layer) and then maybe more pecans too...but it was great and everybody asked for the recipe!  Thanks!!!

Great recipe. I too, made the crust using chocolate graham crackers (2 packages). Instead of making the caramel, I purchased smuckers caramel to save time. Just make sure it's the thicker caramel. I toasted the pecan pieces before adding them to the caramel. I also used Ghirardelli milk chocolate (about a cup and a half of chips). I baked as instructed but with no water bath. 50 minutes in a 325 degree oven and then let it set in the oven for 2 hours. Do not open the oven door! It turned out perfectly, no cracks!! So good, so rich! I made this for my bosses birthday and everyone raved about it. The whole thing was gone in no time! Unfortunately I didn't grab a piece in time to take home to my husband as promised. Looks like I'll have to make another one!!!

I must agree with 'Chaenyn' in saying "what do you do with the carmel sauce???"  I assume from the line in the 'intro' about the ribbon of carmel through the cake, it is to be poured in as a swirl or layer?  Clarifying that would be MOST helpful.  It was delicious and I did swirl it in.

I, too, substituted Oreo cookie crumbs for the graham crackers.  I made this for a belated birthday cake for my husband (he's an over the road trucker), and it's definitely a WINNER!  I'm also a first-time cheesecake maker, and the recipe is very easy!

This cheesecake was a hit.  I made it for my family at Thanksgiving and they loved it!!  I had to fight to get a slice of my own cheesecake.  I made one little change, I tried this recipe at home and I thought the chocolate made it too rich.  So, when I made it for my family I just left the chocolate out of the mix.  Instead, I drizzeld melted chocolate on the cheesecake before serving.  It didn't matter to them b/c they ate it up!!

Wow, this was GREAT!!! So rich, but so tasty. My husband who doesn't like cheesecake even ate some! I doubled the caramel mixture, and used chocolate teddy grahmns for the crust. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and there were NOOO cracks at all. It looked beautiful and my mother in law LOVED it :)

Excellent recipe!  I made a few modifications--used a mixture of 3/4 chocolate wafer cookies to 1/4 honey grahams and reduced the sugar in the crust to 2 T.  Added a bit more sugar to the cheesecake mixture, and toasted the pecans before chopping and adding to the caramel.  Served with homemade caramel sauce and whipped cream with cocoa sweetened with the caramel.  Very nice.  Great texture, straightforward directions.  Would definitely make this again.  Husband said it was the best cheesecake he'd ever eaten, and he is not even a big cheesecake fan:-)  Thanks for the great recipe!

oh my-lanta! This was ahhh-mazing! I made this for a co-workers birthday, and everyone loved it. It came out perfect, no cracks or anything. Followed the recipe exactly. I did cook it for 50 minutes, next time I might add 5 min or so, the inside middle was just a bit mushy. I did drizzle mine with some melted milk chocolate chips for looks. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so excellent.  Everyone loved it.  Instead of having all chocolate, I swirled it in for a mix of vanilla and chocolate.  Very rich!

I made this cake yesterday and it is wonderful!!  I had to leave out the pecans because my husband doesn't like nuts.  This cake was still perfect -- the caramel, the chocolate -- everything was just right.  I served it to my guests last night and everyone raved about it.  In fact, several people took the recipe home with them, that's how much they loved it!!

I used chocolate cookie crumbs for this cake.  It is DELICIOUS. Two things i will do different next time:  1) use about 50 caramels for the filling as 30 was not enough.  2) Use more milk in the carmel as it end up a little harder then I would like.  I put carmel on top too and almost doubled the amount of milk it asked for and it was still thick but not "chewy"   Over all one of my favorite cheesecakes for sure.

Wonderfully decadent and TOTALLY worth the calories!! So creamy and sweet. Chocolate heaven, followed by a layer of luscious caramel. OMG!!!! I made 2 of these cheesecakes for my husband's birthday party. I made them exactly according to the recipe. I also boned up on the subject of cheesecakes by first reading AllRecipes' cheesecake articles. Very helpful.  Anyway, I made the graham cracker crumbs by whirling the broken crackers in the food processor. Very easy. I made sure to use room temperature eggs and softened cream cheese, and (as per the AllRecipes instructions) to beat the ingredients thoroughly yet gently, so as to avoid creating air bubbles.  I baked the first cheesecake sitting in a hot water bath. Wrapped the pan in heavy duty foil, but water still got inside somehow, which gave me a scare. So for the second cake, I put the water bath on the lower oven rack. I'm not sure if it made a difference. The first one (the one sitting in the water bath) actually got a small crack, while the second one did not. Go figure.  I had planned to serve the cheesecake slices drizzled with caramel sauce (and I bought a jar of Smuckers) but in the end I forgot all about it. We did try the caramel sauce later with leftovers, but although it made the cheesecake look very pretty on the plate, it's really not necessary unless you have a VERY sweet tooth.  The reason I made 2 cakes was to ensure plenty of leftovers to enjoy later. Just for the record, it worked out perfectly. One was alm

OMG this was so good!  I made it with splenda so I could have some myself - and it was to die for!  I made this for a birthday for one of the secretaries in our school and not one piece was left.  Everyone loved this!!! I also used reduced fat cream cheese instead of regular.

This was great!!!...I don't like it when I hear people changing the recipe but I did and I am glad. I didn't put any caramel in the crust. Instead I put a layer of filling and then some caramel and then the rest of the filling. PERFECT! The crust wasn't hard to cut into or eat! Try this for a great dessert!

Great cheesecake! Left out the pecans (hubby doesn't like them) and used a bar of Lindt dark chocolate instead of the chocolate chips. Fantastic!

I get rave reviews every time I present this desert.  I've added my own flair by adding hot fudge topping and a drizzle of carmel to the top.  A choco-holic's dream!

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will try it with an oreo crust.  Can't wait to make it again!

Question...We were invited to a dinner party and one of our friends made this recipe. I have to say that this is literally THE BEST cheesecake I have ever had. I am trying to make it today but I have a lot of leftover of the filling. Has anyone else had this problem?

I was looking for a desert to bring to my son's 5th grade dinner & desert auction.  This recipe seemed to hit all the marks for high dollars, cheesecake, chocolate and carmel.  I used walnuts instead of pecans. It cooked beautifully.  It earned $45 for my son's class.  The family that bought it said it was great.  I think I will make one for my family for Valentine's Day.

This was my first time baking a chocolate cheesecake and it couldn't have been easier or tastier.  I loved it and so did my family & guests.  I didn't use caramels on the crust but instead used Caramel Sundae Syrup and generously drizzled it all over the crust before adding the filling.  It was not messy and very easy to do.  The tips about the water pan under the cheesecake and the cooling in the cake worked perfectly.  Thank you so much for a divine recipe.

I made this for my friend's birthday (she's a cheesecake fiend!) and she loved it. Of course she twisted my arm and made me have a slice too! I used the Praline Sundae sauce from this site as I forgot to purchase caramels, added and extra 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese and an extra egg and it was to die for. Talk about eyes rolling back in your head. Next time I'll try to make it low carb with a pecan crust and splenda in the filling. Thank you Amy!

It was not clear on what to do with the caramel sauce.  I have tried it mixed with the chocolate cheese mixture and as a layer.  Both are good.  With some clarification this would be a 5 star recipe.

I followed the recipe but found the directions a little confusing. I didn't understand the 1/3 filling in chocolate and then in pie it just didn't make sense to me. For times sake i picked up an Oreo pie crust and then followed as described. I had so much filling left (which could have been from using the pie crust) that I made two cheesecakes with It! I decorated it with pecans and it came out wonderful! Lots of compliments. 4 stars for lack of clear directions

pretty good cake. i love the cheesecake at the store with chocolate chips and caramel with the cake itself being chocolate. this cake proved to be even better than store bought. i liked everything about except the crust which was a bit lacking. i made for my brother's 21st birthday.

It could have used a little more chocolate in my opinion, but my husband loved it when I made it for our anniversary.  Unfortunately the layer of caramel and pecans made cutting difficult.

Taste was good but consistency was a little off.  I followed the directions exaclty so I don't know what the problem was.  I have made hundreds of different cheesecakes and never had this happen.

Made this for a family birthday and it was a big hit!  It's wonderfully rich so I'd suggest cutting your slices small.  It might be even better with an oreo crust!

I use allrecipes for almost all of my new recipes (and think it's honestly the best) and this is my first time writing a review but I absolutely have to for this recipe! It was by far the best dessert I have ever made. I made it for my family for Thanksgiving and they absolutely loved it -- I even overheard my sister telling my father that it was better than the Cheesecake Factory. I followed the recipe exactly and made more of the caramel/milk mixture (this time w/o pecans) the next day and spread it over the top of the cake. Incredible! I cannot wait to make it again!

This was soooo wonderful. I brought it to the neighbors and everyone loved it. I would say that the crust was a little to hard to cut, but maybe it was too thick or something.

This is the best cheesecake I have had.  I made the crust from chocolate filled Oreos, filling included in crust, about 3/4 of the bag.  I sauted the pecans in butter with a couple sprinkles of salt.  I really beat the filling to get a lot of air in.  This is not as heavy as most cheesecakes, much creamier, more chocolaty.  Next time I will double the caramel and use Ghiradelli double chocolate chips.  I also mixed the rest of the chips straight into the filling for baking.  YUM!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake after many failures years ago... it turned out perfect! Absolutely delicious.  I did have a few small bubbles on top, but no cracks.  I took it by my mom for Easter and everyone loved it.  She took the leftovers to work and they loved it, too. This was the best!!!

Made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving dinner with my in-laws and was a big hit. But made small changes to the recipe though. I melted the caramels with a lot more milk and used almond slivers and the much more spreadable mixture is nicer on top of the cake instead of on the crust. Next time, I'll make this with a Oreo cookies. This one is definitely a keeper.

Excellent Cheesecake. The caramel does harden in the refrigerator which makes it difficult to cut. I might suggest not using the caramel, but melting some and pouring over the top when served. Either way... Delectible. Thanks for this recipe.

This was very rich and    delicious.  The caramel really hardens and is hard to cut through when it's cold, but who cares because the cheesecake is yummy.  It's really rich, which is probably a good thing because otherwise I'd probably eat it all.

It's well worth the slightly lengthy (and possibly messy) prep time. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and dark chocolate for the cake itself, and it was a huge hit at the party I made it for. The pecan-caramel layer is hard to cut through if you don't have a good serving knife, though.

Would probably please a true chocolate lover but I found the heavy chocolate flavour overpowered the caramel/pecan one. Maybe I just don't like chocolate cheesecake that much!

This was super good!  Rich but not too bad - I put extra whipped cream on the top to offset the heaviness.  It didn't really look too pretty though - the caramel layer didn't stiffen up as much as I had hoped - so it was running down the sides of the cake.  But wow it tasted amazing!

This cheesecake was DELICIOUS!!  I made a few small variations.  For example, instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used the Nestle caramel and chocolate chips.  It was so good!  This one is definetly going into the recipe book!  The instructions were a little confusing, but easy to figure out.  I highly recommend this cheesecake!

Wowsers!  This puppy is rich!  Very good, although I would have liked a different chocolate than semi-sweet.  I think next time I might try with something a bit "higer end".  Very easy and tasty.  In-laws loved it.

Something seems to be missing from the instructions. The "filling" is mixed with the chocolate; which filling? the caramel filling or the cream cheese filling?

This was EXCELLENT!  I made this for my husband's birthday, and he said it was the best cheesecake he'd ever had.  I improvised on the recipe a bit.  I used about 50 caramels as suggested by others (I just bought a bad of individually wrapped caramels and used the whole bag).  I also poured some melted chocolate on top of the caramel pecan mixture (I did this after I poured the caramel/pecan mixture onto the crust and put in fridge for 30 minutes).  Then, instead of mixing the rest of the melted chocolate into the cheesecake batter, I poured the cheesecake batter into the crust (on top of caramel/pecan layer and chocolate layer) and then just poured melted chocolate on top of cheesecake mixture and swirled the chocolate in (so it was more of a marbled cheesecake).  I also added a chopped up Skor candy bar to the cheesecake mixture.  I also poured melted caramel and chocolate on top of the cheesecake once it was finished baking.  To serve, I topped with whipped cream and a piece of Skor candy bar.  Delicious!

i have made this several times, it is a fabulous cheesecake.  I used oreo cookie crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs and added extra sugar to the crust mixture.  Another time I used a crust made of simply chocolate cake mix and butter.  it was a huge hit.  just cut about 3/4 of a stick of butter into the cake mix until the peices of butter are very small.  press into springform pan and cook for about 5 minutes and cool before putting the caramel and nuts in.  You won't be able to spread the caramel, however, on this soft crust so I just put it in spoonful by spoonful.  Yummy!

Wow, this recipe was very good! I made this for my husband's birthday, along with a huge dish of lasagna. I don't suggest that! This is a very good cheesecake, I got lots of compliments on it. But very rich and filling. It was simple to make, although it did take some time. I melted both the caramels and chocolate chips in the microwave (suggest defrost) with no problem. A good addition: melt additional caramel and drizzle on top. Will definitely make this again!

This is a really great recipe.  It is time consuming but well worth it.  It helps if you have someone to unwrap the carmels while you are doing some of the other thing like chopping the nuts.  I was thinking that peanuts in place of the pecans would be good may try that next time.  Like someone else wrote don't believe anyone who gives this recipe anything other than 5 stars.

Ultimately tasted great. Confusing that "filling" is talking about 2 different things. Putting cake in fridge made caramel rock hard.

It was very good but the crust is way too chewy with the layer of caramel. The cake did not crack since I placed the water pan in oven with it.

I used mint Oreos for the crust and added the filling to the chips when melting them.  Didnt use the caramels or oecans and used mint flavoring instead of vanilla.  Changed it to a chocolate mint recipe.

Made this for my mom’s birthday!  She LOVED it!  I took the recommendation to make an Oreo cookie crust, followed the instructions & had some additional chocolate for drizzling.  It was delicious!  Very rich, one slice was more than sufficient for me.

I found it terribly difficult to melt the chocolate pieces in the double boiler, it took well over an hour and still did not completely melt. I split the recipe for the mix in half, made half with Dark Chocolate & half with White Chocolate. I eliminated the pecans, as I do not like nuts and pecans are not easily available in Thailand. I did not like layering the caramel over the cracker crust, next time I will mix it in with the batter. Graham crackers are not available here also so I used Australian made malt crackers which tasted very similar to the graham cracker. I did not feel too bad about having to read the recipe 3 times to discover layering the caramel on the crust as mentioned in instruction 1 after reading other reviews. Also, I refuse to use any Nabisco Products after the owner Mondelez' chose to eliminate hundreds of American jobs to manufacture Oreos in Mexico (and give the CEO a multi million dollar bonus)

I had my mom make this for my birthday because I LOVE caramel and cheesecake and chocolate and it was amazing. She did say that she added more Carmel per other people's comments and the crust came out a bit hard to cut through (tasted great though) so I'd stick to the recipe if you're going to use plastic forks, otherwise go for it! This may be my new every birthday cake.

So rich and good! The crust totally made this the best cheesecake ever. I didn't have Carmels so I used Carmel sauce instead. I made strawberry sauce to pour over before serving and grated dark chocolate on top. Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had.

Excellent! The only change I made was I made my own caramel....IF YOU DO THAT, be sure to add the milk to your recipe just like this cheesecake recipe says because I didn't and the caramel got really hard after I baked and then chilled my cheesecake. That is what I will do different next time. God's Blessings!

I thought the cheesecake was fabulous!  Just before serving, I drizzled thin circles of alternating hot fudge sauce and thick caramel sauce (purchased).  Many people who ate it raved about how delicious it was!  I plan to try it with different kinds of crusts so I can eat it too; I am gluten-free and all but the crust is okay for me to have.

Super rich. Too sweet. If you make one be prepared to give all your friends a slice because it's that rich. It's really good but only a little bite every now and then.

So yummy!!  I did not have any graham crackers, so I used oreos instead and oh my gosh, soooooo good!!!  It was my first cheesecake ever.  I did the water bath and it did crack a little, but nothing too bad.  I only had 15 caramels so can't wait to make again with the full amount b.c the caramel taste is so yummy with the chocolate!  This is not too rich at all!  Perfect!

This cheesecake is amazing! I made this for my husband and he loved it so much that he is willing to do anything I want for another one! The key to making this perfect is to use your favorite chocolate. I used Godiva chocolate truffles, since they are my husbands favorite, and they melted down perfectly! Also, I only did a thin layer of caramel mixture on the bottom and swirled the rest on top. I baked it in a water bath for 50 minutes,then shut off the oven,cracked the door and left it for about 3 hours. There wasn't a single crack and this was my first attempt at a cheesecake! Also, before I served it I melted down more caramel and chocolate and drizzled it on top with some chopped pecans. Beautiful and tasty!

It's my birthday tomorrow, so I made this for my cake.  I halved the recipe and made two 4" cheesecakes.  My husband and I split one tonight to "test" it.  :)  I love chocolate, but this was a little too much.  I think this would be a wonderful turtle cheesecake.  If I make this again, I would only turn 1/3 of the batter to be chocolate and swirl it with the regular batter.  Then I would top it with some hot fudge and fresh whipped cream before serving.  The crust and caramel were perfect, just a tad too chocolatly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly but used chocolate grahams and baked for 1 hour, turned off the oven and left it in to cool for 2 hours. It came out picture perfect. Served with chocolate and caramel syrup, whipped cream and pecans on top. My entire family loved it

Scrumptious. The only problem I had was that the butter in the crust melted and leaked out the bottom of my springform pan and made my oven smoke. I baked it for an hour and then craked the oven door until the middle was set. Then I refrigerated it for a day. It was my Valentine's Day gift for my husband, and he really liked it. We ate it with a bit of Cool-whip and chopped up pecans.

One of the best cheesecake recipes I have ever made. Make extra caramel mixture to pour in the bottom as well as on top to make a nice presentation.

This is a great cheesecake!  I've made it twice now.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I used 45 caramels, 5 tbsp half & half, and 1 cup toasted pecans.  It gives you a little more filling to spread around and I love the toasted pecan flavor.

This is a delicious recipe. I did not find it too hard to make, and the end result was delicious!! It seems as though I had to cook it a bit longer than it called for, but that may vary from oven to oven. It is a delicious rich chocolate cheesecake with a scrumptious layer of caramels and pecans. Highly recommended.

I made this for Christmas and my family RAVED about it! The different things I did to the recipe are as follows:

1) I used a whole bag of caramels (minus a couple for snacking ;) ) instead of 30. So I doubled the milk too. I think that helped the caramel to not be too hard in the end.

2) I used chocolate graham crackers instead of regular for the crust.

3) I used a whole bag of graham crackers (they come in two separate bags within the box) instead of just a cup. I never have enough crust. So I added another 1/4 cup of butter to the crust.

4) I didn't 'chill' the caramel/crust, I just left it sitting out on the counter for a few hours before adding the filling.

5) I used 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup Wilton's semi-sweet chocolate buds for the chocolate to go in the cheesecake.

6) Lastly, I topped of the cheesecake with some caramel sundae topping and mini semi-sweet morsels. It was beautiful!

Other than that, I did as the recipe said. Mine didn't crack at all and it wasn't that difficult to cut through the caramel layer. Of course it was a little tougher than your average crust, but not that hard.

I, personally, found it VERY sweet, but I'm giving it a 5 because every person told me it was "incredible" and my sister told me, "This is really good fancy restaurant quality!" I can't imagine serving it with more caramel sauce...it was sweet enough!
I will definately make it again since everyone loved it so. It's a keeper!

Delish!!  Everybody raved about this cheesecake. I did use a little extra caramel. The caramel layer is so yummy it tastes like something a little different than just plane caramel. People kept asking me "what is in that curst?"  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this for a coworker and everyone that had a piece loved it! I did not have any problem with the caramel layer being hard to cut through and I made extra caramel sauce to pour over the cheesecake which was  so good!  My one friend said that it was a nice balance of sweetness as the chocolate cheesecake wasn't overwhelmingly sweet . The only substitution that I did was I used shortbread cookies for the crust instead of graham cracker crumbs and used only one tablespoon of suger in the crust. I like the cookie crust as it seems to stay softer when baked and doesn't get hard. I will make this again for sure!

I may have to come back and edit this later because the cheesecake is still in the oven, but WHOA! this may be another winner. I was inspired to try this recipe because a couple of weeks ago I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time. While there I shared a piece of the most delectable dessert my tastebuds have ever had the pleasure of trying: White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. Well, this recipe sounds pretty close to that one, I think, with a couple of substitutions, and will be perfect for a going-away party for one of my daughter's teachers...

I've used macadamia nuts instead of pecans. And, instead of completely mixing the chocolate with the cheesecake filling, I spooned 1/2 the filling onto the crust and caramel mixture; on top of that, I spooned 3 T melted chocolate and marbled it w/ a knife; I poured the remaining filling into the pan, spooned and marbled another 3-4 T chocolate. Voila! Beautiful! Also, and I know how silly it is considering how full of fat and calories this dessert is, I didn't want a trans-fat-laden crust: I crushed some Newman's Own organic alphabet cookies for the crust instead of using regular graham crackers. I can't wait to see how it turns out!

Once it's done and cooled, I plan on piping some homemade vanilla and chocolate whipped cream around the edges and garnishing the middle with some roasted macadamia nuts and a little more whipped cream. I'm hoping to post a picture when it's ready. :-D

Wow, this cheesecake was a monster hit at a get-together with some family and friends.  I already have requests to make it again.  The tip of placing the pan of water and cooling slowly in the oven was spot on!  I have rarely seen a prettier cheesecake.  I would highly recommend this recipe .

I brought this cheesecake to work and everyone raved about it! Four people specifically said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. I also had a post-it note on my computer that said "that was the worst crappiest, despicable, delicious, awesome, incredibly yummiest cake I've ever had!"

I think that says it all!!!

This was good but it was too rich for our family's taste.  I made it in a 9X13 flat cake pan because I didn't have a spring form pan.  It worked fine, although I did make a bit more of the caramel sauce to account for the bigger surface area (I added 15 more caramels and 1 more Tbsp of milk).  Otherwise I didn't adjust the ingredients at all.

Nothing spectacular about this recipe.  Not worth the effort.  I agree with others that the directions are a bit unclear.  The caramel layer became too hard to cut through.

This cheesecake was to die for! I recently searched this website specifically for a caramel chocolate cheesecake to make for a holiday dinner party I was having. It was fairly easy to make, and people raved! It tasted heavenly and was exactly what I was looking for. I substituted the pecans for walnuts because it was all I had in the house, and I used about 1 cup more graham cracker and more butter than the recipe called for, and also took the advice of others and used extra caramels. 
I highly recommend trying this recipe!

I made this cheesecake for my boyfriend's birthday, and both he and my roommate said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. It is pretty difficult to cut, because the caramel/pecan layer hardens. It actually bent my serving utensil. Otherwise very good.

This was an excellent recipe.  The whole family loved it. It is very time consuming because of  unwrapping the caramels, however it was worth it.  I did add 10 extra caramels for the bottom and then added 20 caramels to spread on top of pie. I also used oreo crumbs for the bottom. This was a delicious treat.

Ecellent! This was my first cheesecake and I am so happy with the results. My husband and children loved it! I used crushed oreo cookies with a sprinkle of cinnamon instead of graham crackers for the crust and also added swirls of chocolate and caramel sprinkled with pecans on top of the cheesecake for presentation.

Marvelous!  Used the Oreo crust as suggested, a few extra caramels and pecans.  But this recipe would be most excellent without a thing changed.  Definitely a repeat!
