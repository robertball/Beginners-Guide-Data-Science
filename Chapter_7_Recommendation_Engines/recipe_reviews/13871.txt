I looked around at recipes on this site and didn't find anything better.  Here's my twist:  Before I cube the bread, I spread it with butter then sprinkle it liberally with cinnamon sugar.  It sticks to the bread and bakes into the pudding.  Very good.  Other than that, this recipe is wonderful!

This bread pudding is so good! It was a hit at Thanksgiving this year. I also sprinkled in some cinnamon along with the nutmeg and brown sugar as some others suggested, great idea!

Fabulous recipe which has been enjoyed by everyone who tasted it. I used Challah bread instead of French bread (and a lot more than the recipe calls for). I also used quite a bit more brown sugar and pecans on the top, and made a bourbon sauce to finish it with. Delicious!

Great bread pudding!! I made a few slight changes...I used half cream & half milk, crossaints instead of french bread and increased the amount of bread significantly.  I didn't have nuts so I just topped with brown sugar, cinnamon & nutmeg.  I also made the brown sugar sauce from this site and served the bread pudding with it.  WONDERFUL!!

This was a really nice bread pudding.  I brought it to my boyfriends parents' house for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit (in a crowd that's usuallly not big on dessert!).  To make it a little richer (for the holidays) I used 3 eggs and 2 egg yolks and also used cream for 1/3 of the milk.  I also used the new Splenda baking blend to cut the sugar--no discernible difference.

This was fabulous.  I did add cinnamon and it needed to bake for over an hour, but smothered with whipped cream, it's delicious!

Great use of leftover bread! As a matter of fact, I'm eating the rest of it now. I added raisins and cinnamon to mine. Wonderful recipe made with ingredients found in the pantry.

I've never really had bread pudding before, but my mom claims to be an expert, and she dubbed this "EXCELLENT!" I just heated up a cup of half and half and a cup of skim milk in the microwave as my "scalded" milk. I didn't use nuts because I was too lazy/exhausted from work/kids/etc. to chop them right now, but sprinkled a little snack pack of raisins on top. For the bread, I used a starting to go moldy bag of Amoroso rolls- I cut the moldy bits off, of course! Great recipe. Thanks!

This is by far the best bread pudding recipe that I've found. It isn't too sweet, and the custard makes a perfect base for pretty much any combination of bread-puddingy flavors that strike your fancy.

I took another reviewer's advice and brushed butter,  sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg on the bread before I cut it into chunks. I then pretty much stuck to the recipe, but topped it with sliced apples and walnuts sprinkled with nutmeg, brown sugar, and cinnamon. It was great! I've put this recipe in my stack to reuse over and over.

Very good!  Will try to add cinnamon nex time and the bread can be varied.  Would be delicious with Whiskey sauce or brown sugar sauce.

Yes, this recipe is the Bomb! It was my first time making bread pudding and it was delicious :) Yum! I added a bit more white sugar and topped with caramel sauce after done cooking. I also added 1/2 cup more milk bc I wanted it soft and gooey. But the original recipe was delicious too. Everyone kept saying it was too much sugar, but I thought it fine. I actually added more sugar the 2nd time bc it wasn't sweet enough for me. But everyone's taste buds are different. The only thing I have to say is the nutmeg is very strong, so I would lightly sprinkle it. You can also substitute for cinnamon if you prefer. Still great!!

Great!  I made homeade yeast rolls from this site for Thanksgiving, froze some, and eat a bunch...lol...the receipe made 36 rolls, so I made this bread pudding out of the leftovers and it was really good!  I did add a teaspoon of Watkins cinnamon, omitted the nuts (dad has no teeth), and scalding the milk is unneccessary.  Just heat the milk as it is already pasturized and temper it into the egg mixture! We really enjoyed it!  Thanks!

Great texture. It was a little bland, so I'll definitely add more spices and maybe some fruit next time.

This recipe was fantastic! The only thing i changed was the bread. I had a bag of day old Brioche dinner rolls that were about to go bad so i used them instead and i made some lemon curd to go with it. Wonderful recipe and im definitely making it again!

I very much enjoyed this recipe!  It is so simple and very tasty.  And adding cinnamon sugar to the actual bread before you put the other stuff on like other users suggested makes it even better. Thanks for this recipe.

I don't rate very often... love love loved this recipe.  I have never made bread pudding myself but we had left over cinnamon rolls from the can and they were awful (not like we remembered when we were kids) and we wanted to turn them into something for an evening dessert and so I found this recipe, used the dried cinnamon rolls as the bread and the only thing I did was add raisins and it was perfect.

I highly altered this recipe, but it was a great starting point :)

Changes I made:
 - Used homemade Challah instead of french bread
 - Replaced the milk with half and half and only used 1 1/3 C.
 - Added about 3/4 C dried sweetened cranberries and the 2/3 C orange juice I reconstituted them in (cooked the lot on the stove for about 10 min).
 - Left out the nutmeg (didn't have any) and the pecans.

Served it with a simple caramel sauce:
 - 1/2 C each of butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cream - cooked together on the stove for a few minutes until hot and well combined.  

Next time I plan on reducing the sugar a bit since the challah, sweetened cranberries, and orange juice added plenty on their own.

I have never had bread pudding before but had lots of leftover bread from Thanksgiving so I needed a recipe to use it all up. WOW! Amazing taste! It was DELICIOUS! I left out the nutmeg because I don't like the flavor and it was fabulous. Making this again for a Christmas Party next week. Quick and easy!

THIS WAS THE BEST BREAD PUDDING, I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE, BUT DID TAKE THE ADVISE OF ANOTHER REVIEWER AND BUTTERED THE BREAD THEN DIPPED IN CINNAMON & SUGAR,ADDED JUST WHITE SUGAR & CINNAMON FOR THE TOP. I USED ASSORTED BREADS,WHITE, 1 ENGLISH ~ MUFFIN & ARTISIAN BREAD THAT WAS GETTING HARD,I DID LEAVE THE MIXTURE SOAK A BIT BEFORE PUTTING IN THE OVEN,IT WAS A HIT WITH ALL THAT ATE IT! NO NUTS~~

Wow!  This was sooo good!  Definitely a good way to use up some day-old bread.  Only change I made was to toss the bread cubes in some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  Oh, and I served this with a big dollop of whipped cream.  No leftovers!  I will definitely make this again!

In my 63 years I have never made bread pudding, but I tried this recipe and it turned out great! I don't know why I have never tried making bread pudding because I like it, I did add cinnemon.

This is a great recipe and very easy.  I doubled the batch and am so glad that I did (because it's so delicious).  I followed the tip of another reader and coated the bread cubes with a little drizzled butter, cinnamon and sugar ahead of time.  I also doubled the brown sugar.  This was the first time that I've ever used a warm bath baking dish method.  It was so easy and yummy!  Thank you.

I made this recipe for my New Year's Day dinner and it was a hit.  My mom (who hates bread pudding) loved it!  Since I like a firmer pudding with more bread & less custard, I used about an extra half-cup of bread cubes.  It came out perfect for my taste - firm but still sweet and creamy - with just a hint of nutmeg and a wonderful vanilla aroma and taste.  I did alter the recipe a bit by using half milk & half cream.  I've made others and tasted others but this is my favorite bread pudding!  This recipe is very easy to follow and the results seem foolproof.  It is awesome alone but you can "kick it up a notch" with the Brown Sugar Sauce recipe on this site.  Thanks so much for submitting this great recipe!  It is going to be my traditional New Year's dinner dessert YAY!

I am not sure if I did something wrong but this did not come out good. The top tasted fine but the rest was not to my liking. Even while it was baking, the smell was not that strong considering the nutmeg and vanilla.It ended up in the trash. A waste of ingredients.I would not make it again.

Super good! I had some boring white sandwich bread and decided to try out a bread pudding recipe, to get some use out of the bread. This bread pudding is delicious!!! I like that it doesnt call for raisins. I like raisins, but not in bread pudding. I did not make a sauce to drizze on top, and it saw still so good! My husband loved this too! My little tiny dogs were begging for a taste! This recipe was the BEST!!!!

Very yummy recipe. I especially enjoyed it with the pecans added and also added a little bit of the Brown Sugar Sauce found here on this site! I will make this again come fall/winter time.

Delicous! But did tweak it a bit. I added a can of apple pie filling on bottom of dish .You should scald the milk as it helps dissolve the sugar in the egg mixture. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar totaling the same amount per recipe. Added more vanilla for flavor and cinnamon & nutmeg to egg mixture. Added raisins. Topped with brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and pecans. Made a carmel sauce on side of dish. Loved it served warm invite friends to enjoy they go together!!

Good recipe!!! I suggest buttering each slice and adding some of the sugar from the original directions and adding cinnamon to it.   We also added some Bailey's Irish Cream to the egg mixture. Not too much but it helps give the recipe a subtle hint. ;-)

This is my first time trying bread pudding...it's very good.  I doubled the recipe and used a mixture of leftover italian bread and some homemade honey wheat bread that was starting to dry out.  I think next time I make it I will do what others have suggested with the butter, cinnamon/sugar and add raisins.  But as is it is very good too.

Love it! I also add a little cinnamon to the top before baking, and I alter just a little--I mix all ingredients together before baking, instead of just pouring on top and sticking in the oven. Delicious!

Loved it!  Made this last night (1st attempt at bread pudding) and its delicious.  I used walnuts, buttermilk bread and was out of nutmeg.  Very happy with this dessert and will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  I soaked raisins in rum for 10 minutes while I was preparing the mixture.  Drained them and added before baking.  Also, a good source of bread if the day old section of the grocery store.

Extraordinary comfort food!  I used leftover french rolls, and yes, I buttered and added cinnamon/sugar to the bread before cutting, as other reviewers have done.  Delicious crunch on the top, creamy and rich in the middle.

Pretty darn good, although just a bit too sweet for my tastes.  I'll probably reduce the sugar to 1/3c next time.  2 1/2 cups of bread did not seem like enough, so I added extra (probably about a cup).  I also mixed a few dashes of cinnamon into the egg mixture.  I don't know if it was water bath, but the bread pudding cooked perfectly in my old oven that loves to cook unevenly and burn things.

This pudding have a very good texture and easy to be cut into small portion without any problem.  The only problem is that I forget to sprinkle brown sugar before bake it but it's still delicious.

This is a great recipe.  The use of french bread and the crunchy sugar and nuts on top give it wonderful texture.  A lot more interesting than most bread puddings.

Thus bread pudding is Lovely?
I used homemade amish bread and farm fresh Rhode Island Red eggs.I whipped the eggs untill they started to peak a bit after adding the sugar  & vanilla. It really made a beautiful custard in this dish. Bravo!!

We made this recipe in my FACS class as a way to use leftover bread, milk and eggs from another cooking project. Most of the kids had never heard of bread pudding, but now they all want the recipe for their cookbooks. Easy and delicious. We drizzled a little caramel sauce on top and used cinnamon apple bread instead of white bread, no other changes, it was perfect!

This bread pudding is delicious!  5 kids and 2 adults tried it, and we all LOVED it!  We had a little whipped cream on top (I left out the pecans.)  Tonight, I am trying it with some blueberries.  Thanks for sharing this!!!!

Very good basic bread pudding.  I used leftover rolls from the Virginia Box Bread recipe on this site.  The only changes I made were to add about a tsp of cinnamon to the egg mixture & used twice the amount of brown sugar on top.  Oh, I also added just a little bit of lemon zest to the egg mixture as well.  Will be making again & playing with the versatility of the recipe!

This was very good with fresh fruit It took a lot longer to cook but I think I made it a little thick in a caserol instead of the baking pan. I did add a lot more nutmeg and mixed it as well as sprinkling on the top. I also used cinnamon to flavor. And we loved it!!

Made this today and my husbands still raving about it.  Next time I will drizzle a little rum sauce over the top.  I used Brosche bread and soy milk (my husband has a lactose problem).

I once taste bread pudding in the hotel I stayed and I like that bread pudding a lot. This is the first bread pudding I try and so far I'm very satisfied with the results as the taste is similar to the one I've tasted before. The only thing I changed is the amount of sugar as I feel the sugar is just too much for my taste. All that's left is to create a good sauce to eat with it and this recipe will be perfect :D

I used a whole loaf of day old french bread.  Like another reviewer, I buttered and sprinkled sliced bread w/ cinnamon before cubing.  I used half buttermilk (because I already had it) and half milk, and topped liberally with brown sugar and cinnamon.  It was excellent and easy.

I skipped the nutmeg and pecans and used cinnamon and sugar.  It tasted great, I loved that it wasn't too sweet.

Really good. Bain-marie baking gives me a lovely custard texture and I loved it! I baked two batches in one day just because it was so simple and so tasty at the same time.

This is a really good recipe for basic bread pudding.  Mine turned out a little dry on top so next time I will make a little more of the pudding.  I also added chocolate chips - a handful in between the first and second layers of bread and another handful on top.  This is my husband's favorite way to eat bread pudding and it turned out pretty yummy.  I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg because my husband is allergic to nuts.
