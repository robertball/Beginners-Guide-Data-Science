So far this is the best pound cake I have ever eaten or made. I did make some minor changes, first of all I creamed the butter, shortening, and sugar for 25 mins, it was so light and fluffy( that is the secert to a great cake base).Then I added 1 egg at a time and beat for 30 seconds apeice. I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract.I also added 1 tablespoon of corn starch for each cup of flour (the cornstarch turns the all-purpose flour into cake flour). Last but not least I made some sour milk by adding 1 tablespoon of vinger and 1/4 teaspoon of vinger to the milk and let it turn while I was creaming the first 3 ingredients ( sour milk is just homemade buttermilk) Also start and end with the dry ingredients. Do not over beat when you start adding the dry ingredients or the cake will be tough. I baked the cake at 325 dregrees for 90 mins, but start checking after 60 mins. The last 20 mins I tented the cake with foil shinny side up away from the cake. Ummmmm, ummmm, good this cake was not dense at all it was so light, best pound cake to date.

Excellent pound cake which will be perfect for the wedding cake I'm about to make !  I used all butter instead of butter and shortening and reduced the milk by about 40ml since butter has 15% water compared to shortening.  Also reduced sugar to 2 1/4 cups.  As with other reviewers, had to cover the cake at  about 40 min. since the crust was already browned and only cooked it for just over an hour.  Very moist, soft, fine crumb cake.

I loved this cake! Okay, let me start off by saying that I NEVER bake! I learned some things from my mother when i was younger, but that's about it. This recipe was sooooo easy to follow!! I was trying to re-create a birthday cake recipe that is a childhood memory. I knew the old recipe was a pound cake, and I was hoping with all the great reviews this cake would live up. It did! I frosted it with the "Special Buttercream" recipe from this site and it was amazing! I made a Barbie doll cake with the wilton wonder mold.

Let's talk about the cake though: baked in 90 minutes, came out with a golden crust that was perfect for frosting b/c there were NO crumbs. When the cake was cut into, you could SEE how moist it was! The flavor is not sweet at all, and was a great balance with the sweet buttercream frosting. It was alomst white (which I loved!) Could that be b/c I used clear vanilla extract? I dunno, I had it on hand so I used it. Either way, I loved the color! I loved how easy it was to bake, and I loved how great it tasted! Thank you very much for sharing and I know this recipe will be used over and over again for many years to come!

I used this recipe for two wedding cakes that I made, based on caption from BROWNEYES230117. Not only is it structurely sound for a tiered wedding cake, it is delicious! I received rave reviews on the moistness and flavor. Over two hundred people tried and loved it. One note: this recipe as is will fill one 12" round pan 2" high. I have also make 1 1/2 the recipe to make four 8" round pans 2" high (generously). I would think it will make three 8" rounds with one batch.

oh my God!!!!! This was my first time ever making a pound cake from scratch and WOW!! Did it come out pretty.  I made the one sub which was all butter(1.5 cup) omiting the shortening.  And yes PLEASE cover with foil when it turns the perfect color.  My nephew told me to cut my last peice because the rest of the cake was his, lol.  Oh and make sure you have time to make it.  Beat the sugar for at least 25 mins. and  bake from a cold oven.  Oh and don't forget to lick the bowl!!!

Made it exactly as the recipe showed...The top did brown up quick in about 40 minutes so I covered it with foil.  It was done in a little over an hour.  Very moist- not too sweet like other reviewers have commented...I'll make it again!!!

This was the best cake I've ever had, hands down.  Wow!  Super moist, buttery, light, just perfect!

I made a glaze for it with cinnamon, allspice, confectioners sugar, melted butter and vanilla & spooned it over the top while warm.  

Everyone raved. This is my new standard recipe for all cake occasions.

This cake is very easy to make and tastes great! I made an orange flavoured version. I modified it a little: I used 1 1/2 cup of margerine instead of butter and shortening; 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup orange juice in place of 1 1/4 cup milk. I also added 10g of emulsifier and the zest of 1 orange. I beat it with the lowest speed to get a fine texture. It was ready after only 45 mins but the outside crust was a little too brown for my liking. Next time I will reduce the temp to 150-160 C and bake it for 30-40 mins.

Great recipe for the classic pound cake. Dense, tender, fine crumb; deliciously adorned with nothing more than sweet vanilla flavor.  Well-written, accurate directions.  I scaled the recipe down to six servings which yielded 12 cupcakes that I baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.

I needed a cake that was sturdy and tasty and this was it! I followed the recipe exactly, but made a round four-layer cake. It was sooo good! I had made it for a birthday cake, so I frosted it with buttercream, but the cake would have been just as delicious without any frosting.

I would give this pound cake a 10 if I could!  It is FABULOUS and moist.  (I used two sticks of Blue Bonnett margarine instead of butter.)  I am 51 years old and have never made a pound cake in my life, much less one from scratch.  I made the first one with a hand mixer a few days before Christmas and got rave reviews at the law firm where I work and my family.  Even my neighbor (who considers himself a pound cake expert) was floored by how good this one was.  I made two more for a gathering on Christmas eve and my family's Christmas dinner.  I have now ordered Kitchenaid stand mixer and plan to make lots and lots more of these fabulous cakes with variations.  Thank you so much for putting this recipe on the internet!!!!!

After reading the reviews I made some modifications mostly from "Carthecook".  I substituted butter milk for the plain milk and added extra vanilla and 1 tsp lemon extract.  This cake was delicious!  I found it got better sitting over night in the fridge.  It is moist and the lemon really added a light refreshing zing to the cake. I used powdered sugar, cream, vanilla and lemon extract to make a glaze. Yummm!

I found the recipe was perfect just the way it is. I read the way carthecook approached it and had considered it, but it seemed like too much & a whole new recipe.  I did reduce the sugar from 3 cups to 2 the first time, based on one rating that said it was too sweet; then reduced to 2 & 1/2 cups the second time I baked the cake.  The recipe proved itself flawless each time.  Thank you.

Way....too sweet. Already cut the sugar in 2.5 cups when i red the recipe but still too sweet.So you can't realy taste the buttery flavor because all you taste is sugar.

Followed recipe exactly, with exception of forgetting the sugar and vigorously beating it in after the eggs. It's delicious! I've already eaten too much. Perfect for the strawberry trifle birthday dessert

wonderful pound cake. I do recommend checking on the cake after 60 minutes of baking, and if needed put foil on top for the last 20 minutes, so the top (bottom of the cake) is not burned. GREAT TASTING CAKE!

I made a vegan version of this using 'egg replacer' and soya milk mixed with water (60-40 ratio) and the result was a very nice soft cake. Everyone in my family loved it; thx for the great recipe!

I loved it I totally agree with CarThe Cook...Between the both of you I made a prefect pound cake..I altered by using cake flour instead of flour...and i used 1tsp of almond extract and 11/4 tsp of vanilla extract...as far as the butter, sugar, and shortening I beat it for 15-20 min...and i used heavy cream instead of milk....This was my second time making a pound cake and this was a great great recipe...Love it thank you and thanks to carthecook

I made this cake for strawberry short cake.  It was very good.  I checked it after 1 hour and it was done, so I would recommend checking it early.  I am at high altitude maybe that was the difference.

This cake was great! I made it for a birthday and it was a huge success. I didn't use all of the sugar that the ingredients said to use. It actually wasn't sweet enough, so next time I will use all of the sugar. It is a very moist cake and all of my friends loved the texture! I would absolutely recommend this!

I bake breads all the time but have never tried a cake. I used the ingredients in the amounts listed except I used all butter (no shortening) and I followed the directions given by "CARTHECOOK" in her review. I just used regular milk (not soured). My Oh My! What a great airy pound cake!

i give it a 3 because HOLY MOLY if you really used 3 cups of sugar, i truly cant see how anyone could consume it. i used barely 2 cups sugar and its no where near what REAL POUND CAKE is supposed to taste like. however going by instructions , perfect way to actually make it come together. my advice is lower to say maybe 1 1/2 cups sugar that way you can GLAZE THE  THING!

Great recipe! I substituted vegetable oil for the shortening and the results were spectacular. This cake was a big hit with my family and friends and has become a permanent part of my recipe collection.

This is the best pound cake I have ever had! I took another reviewer's suggestion and added lemon extract. I put in 1 tsp and it was PERFECT! I made cupcakes (2 doz from one batch), filled them with a strawberry puree and topped them with a whip cream frosting. OMG....so good.

This is a fantastic pound cake! I did make one substitution in that I used an extra stick of butter instead of the shortening. It does make a lot of batter, so if you really wanted to, you could make three 8" layer cakes, maybe even four. It's also a very dense cake, so a small slice is filling, but it's so delicious! I topped mine with homemade whipped cream frosting and put some strawberries in the center. So good!

I read the great reviews and went strictly by the recipe, but the cake didn't taste good to me. The texture was fine, but the taste was too bland. It didn't taste like a typical poundcake that I am used to, like the kind the ladies bake at church bake sales, or the local bakery butter poundcake. I'm not sure why, but the taste simply wasn't there. Sorry.

Awesome Pound Cake!  It was super moist and very easy to make.  The mixer did all the work.  I did add a little orange zest but that was the only adjustment.  My family loved this!!!!!

Great recipe. Halved the sugar for two cakes. They turned out great and so delicious! Check to see if your cake is done around 60 minutes - in my oven  80 to 90 min is too long!

Excellent.  Followed directions exactly, and creamed butter, shortening and sugar 25 minutes.  Stuck to my pan, but is still delicious.  Just baked for family, and they won't care if it isn't exactly perfect looking since it tastes so good!

Best pound cake recipe ever. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and kept everything else and wow, it tasted better than cake mix, so moist, not dense at all, perfectly sweet. This is really the no fail cake. Even my husband loved it and he usually doesn't eat cakes or sweet stuffs, but devoured this cake without frosting.

i gave it 5 stars for simplicity and the ability to substitute successfully:  While it seems impossible, I made it a mission to make this delectable dessert "healthy-ish."  I used 1 cup of Lite ICBINB and 1/4 cup butter (for flavor,) 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of stevia, 3 eggs, 2 tbls of vanilla, 1 cup of skim milk, 3 cups of whole wheat flour, and 3 tbls of cornstarch.  I can honestly say that the family loved it and didn't miss a thing...it came out beautifully and tasted oh so sinful.  Mission accomplished!  Yum!

It tasted good but I couldn't serve it b/c it burned after only 60 minutes of cooking.  I had to tent with foil after just 30 minutes.  I suppose my oven could be off-temp, but I've never experienced anything like this before.

Great recipe!!! A keeper, easy to make, great taste and nice grain.  I just took out of oven and I am making a symple syrup of 1/4 of sugar, 1/4 cup water and boiling it.  When cooled I will add a tsp of Chambord Liqour (rapsberry flavored) and moist it with this.  The cake itself is moist but I like flavoring syrups on my cakes.

I have made this pound cake several times and it's perfect every time.  I have added 1/2 c. finely chopped marachino cherries and today I'm going to try a blueberry version.  Love this recipe and will continue to use it often.

By far the best pound cake recipe I have come across!! Even though I used only 1 cup of butter no shortening and 2 1/2 cups of sugar it still was fantastic. I had to whip the butter and sugar for about 20 minutes or so and added the eggs one at a time mixing each one in for 30 seconds each. So light and smooth, the crumb was fine mmmmmm just perfect! Great for birthday or wedding cakes!!

YUM!! I just made this cake ... We eat ours without icing as my husband and I are not big fans of it. I made 2 changes. 1st i used all butter and I reduced the sugar by half a cup. It was done in about 65 minutes. I also covered the top around 45 minutes as it was done. I will definitely be making it again and will reduce sugar to two cups as this cake was still too sweet.

This is a pretty good pound cake. The consistancy is off a little. I think there's just a tad too much sugar in it for me. If I make this one again, I think I'll cut the sugar by 1/4 to 2/3 cup. The taste is good with just the vanilla, but like I said it's a little sweeter than I'm used to in a pound cake. I give it an A-.

I tried the cake but forgot the salt.  I am not sure if that made a difference, but it tasted a little too sweet.  Next time I will try it without as much sugar.  It came out perfect as far as the rise and how it looked.  However it taste a little like sweet cornbread......not sure what happened.

I made this cake for my friends birthday party. It was amazing! I did make the changes that people said about the lemon, which made it just wonderful. This cake was fluffy and the best pound cake i have made so far! I used fondant and "best buttercream frosting" on it!   Thanks for the good recipe!

Well, I didn't make this cake but I did have a piece of the one that Klassy made.  Delicious and I will be trying to make one real soon.  Some did not like the three cups of sugar but it was fine to me.  The cake was not overly sweet.  I do agree that it doesn't need any type of glaze...it was perfect as is.  I would like to try it with stawberries and whipped cream!

Perfect recipe!  The only thing is that the cooking time should be reduced to about 50 minutes.  I didn't use an icing or glaze.  This cake is wonderful as is.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent cake. I made them for my office christmas party and everyone loved them. I did follow the suggestion of creaming the butter, shortening, and sugar together for 25 minutes, the only difference is that I used confectioner's sugar and it became a lot fluffier than granulated sugar, and allowed the butter to get to room temperature. But I do recommend this recipe to everyone!

It was simply the best!  So this year instead of spending $50 on a birthday cake for my son's party, I'm gonna make this cake! Everyone loved it!  Only recommendation, if you don't like real sweet cakes then try cutting the sugar down a tad bit.

I was not overly impressed by the results.  The kids kept opening the oven so the middle sank.  The top got a little over cooked and the bottom just right.  I will try it again, but after the kids are in bed, and just half the recipe so I will be able to give it a 'real' try.

This was a pretty good base recipe. I did make some changes. I don’t use shortening so I subbed coconut oil. I cut the sugar to 2.5 cups based on the conflicting reviews, some said too sweet others said wasn’t sweet enough. I think ultimately I would cut sugar to 1.5, maybe 1.75 cups. I doubled the vanilla to 2 tablespoons. I used 3/4 cup of buttermilk and 1/2 cup of skim ricotta cheese instead of the 1.25 cups of milk. Finally, I added a tablespoon or more of lemon zest. It turned out pretty good, but I thought with the 2.5 cups of sugar it was still a bit too sweet. It’s a good recipe but you will need to tweak it to suite your taste.

Cooked on 325 (1st cake burned on 350). Didn't sift flour, or add baking soda. Added lemon extract for more flavor, reduced milk, and added cream cheese (that almost another  identical recipe from site utilized). Just don't keep shortening so used all  butter ( 3 sticks). Very tasty.

We accidentally left a whole carton of eggs out of the fridge so we needed to use them up. I had to make several substitutions as I couldn't get to the store. I used coconut oil instead of shortening (that stuff'll kill you anyway!) and 2 cups of brown sugar in place of 2 of the cups of white sugar... Came out super awesome anyway! It was just a darker color like a spice cake but it tasted great. It was done late last night and it was gone by early morning. :)

Wonderful pound cake! I made this for a graduation party and iced it with my homemade butter cream icing. Everyone loved it.

Great cake! I used all butter, otherwise followed the recipe, and it turned out perfect, my husbands new favorite. I did start checking it after 60 minutes, and it was done. I topped it with chocolate buttercream,  took it to a family gathering, and was told not to change a thing!

Believe all the positive reviews for this one!  I've made this cake 3 days in a row now.  It has yet to last 24 hrs after making it.  My 4 kids all love it (and there are very few things all 4 of them love!).  I followed CARTHECOOK's advice about creaming butter and sugar for 25 minutes.  I used 2 sticks butter, one stick Earth Balance.  I used about 1 3/4 cup sugar.  Great cake!!  So moist and nice flavor.  My kids love it with the Vanilla Glaze recipe from this site.  For my husband and I, I drizzled melted chocolate over it - yum!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made an exception to the recipe based on personal preference. I used all butter. Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Hands-down, the absolute best cake I've ever baked. I divided batter between two pans and frosted the layers with a frosting recommended by one of the other reviewers.. Moist. Flavorful. Beautiful texture. Thanks for a great recipe!! (BTW, I creamed the butter and sugar for 25 minutes as suggested by CARTHECOOK.)

Good recipe.  I feel like something is missing.  I think I will add fresh lemon juice and zest next time instead of Lemon extract as recommended on one of the reviews.  Family ate it, but not as fast as usual.  Will definitely make it again.

This is amazing "pound" cake.  I've always found pound cakes to be a little dangerous..too dense, not enough flavor, difficult to layer, and so on.  This cake is, hands down, the most amazing cake (period) I've ever made.  Yes, yes, cream the sugar and butter for the full 25 minutes, it makes all the difference.  Add your eggs one at a time, and mix each for at least 30 seconds.  I used half regular milk and half buttermilk.  Also, I followed the recommendation of substituting a bit of lemon extract for some of the vanilla with a fantastic result.  I made two (rather thick) layers, and then split those for a beautiful 4 layer cake...made some strawberry filling...and it was spectacular!!!  This will be my go-to cake recipe from this point on!

Based on the reviews, I adjusted the amount of sugar to 2.25 cups and I used brown sugar. Came out really good. Would make it again and maybe add some flavoring. Great around-the-house-during-the-week-something-to-satisfy-my-sweet-tooth cake! ??

This is the best pound cake I've ever made!! It was moist, delicious, and just perfect. Did I already say it was delicious? This will be my number one pound cake recipe. I think the balance of butter and butter flavored Crisco is the reason why this cake was so..... moist. I used Vanilla Butternut flavoring instead of vanilla as I think it has a better flavor than regular vanilla flavoring.

I made this recipe into cupcakes (I stopped at 24 and threw the rest of the batter away).  WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR.  The bottom of my cupcake papers were VERY oily.  The tops of the cupcakes were crunchy and flat.  The insides were a beautiful light and fluffy texture.  Not sure if baking as cupcakes instead of a cake made a difference, but I am not going to try again to find out.  EDIT--9/23/14--Had to come back and change my rating.  Tasted these again last night and this morning and what a difference in the taste!  Still just a little too sweet, so will cut back a LITTLE on the sugar.  The tops of my cupcakes have turned out to be my favorite part--not crunchy now, kind of a chewy texture (not sure how to describe).  I did not put any frosting on them.  Just wish they weren't flat.  Might be something I did.  Will definitely make these again.

It came out nice and fluffy. Modified the serving size to 6 as I only had two eggs, baked in a loaf pan and it was ready in 40 minutes. I also followed CARTHECOOK suggestions. I only used butter and next time I'll reduce the sugar.

I just made this cake and we love it! It is the perfect Pound Cake recipe. I did take the advice of one reviewer and I cut the sugar down to 2-1/2 cups, I also baked mine on 325o, it took about an hour and 15 minutes, and it turned out moist and Delicious! You can add any flavoring, nuts, chocolate chips, to this recipe and personalize it to your taste! LOVE IT!

This was my first time baking a cake from scratch, and I loved it!  My oven bakes this cake just right in 45 minutes. I usually make two cakes with this recipe because the batter is too much for one 12 cup bundt pan. My only complaint is that I need more people to bake for. I would eat way too much if I made this cake often.

I have made this cake twice, loved it! Moist and delicious. My oven runs a little hot so I reduced bake time to 60 min. turned out GREAT.
I adjusted the recipe to make a Christmas wreath cake. I substituted 10oz of egg whites for the eggs to give me a white pound cake and I substituted 1/2 of the vanilla with peppermint extract. Prior to adding to the pan I removed half of the batter putting it into 2 bowls to which I added red and green food coloring. Then put half the remaining batter into the pan, added the red and then the green batter, then the remaining white batter. Then I marbled the mixture in the pan. To add a little holiday flare to the cake I divided 1 container of white butter cream frosting into 3 microwaveable bowls and added red and green food coloring to 2 of the bowls and microwaved for 20 seconds each. I drizzled the white, red and green frosting over the cake. Turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it.

I have tried other pound cake recipes but this one was the best. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar, I used 2 cups instead of 3. The taste was just right, I also put a cream cheese glaze over the cake. Perfect.

Made only two change and used 2 cups of sugar for fear it might be to sweet as said by others and I used 2 loaf pans instead of a bundt pan. It could have used slightly more sugar. The cake is lighter and airy than what I think a pound cake should be. Other than that it was very moist and ok. I think it will change some after cooling.

I adjusted this cake to a serving size of 50 and it made 2-10in wilton round pans, 2-9-in rounds, and 2 6-inch rounds....this cake was awesome! I made a baby shower cake with it and it ices and stakes great! I got a ton of complements on this cake and several women at the shower wanted the recipe!

It turned out perfect! I picked this recipe because I had all of the ingredients on hand. I used butter-flavored Crisco for the shortening, and it was great! It was perfectly moist, not too dense, and had a beautiful color. I took the advice and covered the cake with foil after the first 20 minutes - a great suggestion - and it was finished in 60 minutes. 
I had some extra frozen berries I heated up, added a small amount of sugar and lemon juice, and it was amazing! A+ from this baker!

Do not let the pan sit for 10 minutes only before putting it on a cooling rack.  I NEVER do that, but the directions said to, so I did, and the cake fell to pieces.  Our housefull of boys didnt mind, but this mistake drove me absolutely nuts.  I was hoping to glaze it as well, but it couldnt happen.  Ah, well.  Live and learn. Hubby said this tasted better than his mothers, but he may have just been trying to make me feel better about my messy attempt at pound cake.

I have made this recipe twice and everyone has raved about it.  I add a little more vanilla, but that is the only change I make.

I made this for a carved 3D airplane cake I was making. The density was perfect and held its shape great. Easy to ice as well! Next time, i will cut back on the sugar as it seemed a bit sweet.

Great recipe! The only thing I did different was to use all butter instead of shortening, and I decreased the milk to 1 cup. It turned out great, very moist!

This was a very good Pound Cake.
 At first I thought using shortning
 along with butter was a little much.
 I noticed when I cut the cake,it was
 hard to cut and tough on the outside
 but all so moist on the inside.I made
 a nice Vanilla glaze drizzle.My family
 enjoyed the cake.My mother said the 
 Cake is more like a Coffee Cake,and
 that it would go good with Coffee or
 Cocoa.

Wonderful recipe. My husband thought it was an angel food cake. It was so easy to do. I am never good at baking but this one is proving me wrong. Kept the recipe as is, did not change a thing. Thank you.

This was easy to make and turned out perfect.  I do not bake much and my co-workers were very impressed. Moist, not too sweet.  I used a recipe for lemon glaze that I found on this site.

Yummy pound cake, thanks for sharing.  I made two loaves instead of the traditional way and adjusted the amount of ingredietns accordingly.  Great with a cup of coffee.
