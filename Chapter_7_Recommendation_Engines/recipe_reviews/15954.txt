I thought that the recipe was really a great one.  The only thing is...if you are using a regular (not deep dish) pie crust, this recipe makes two pies.  I found this out the hard way.  I thought that since it says it only makes one pie that I would double the recipe for two...Right??  Wrong...I ended up with four pies.  This is not a bad thing, though.  The neighborhood just loved it too!!

All Lemon Lovers must try this pie.  I've made this twice and recommend filling 2 shells(Mrs Smith's 9")instead of one, replace milk with half and half, increase lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  If not set in 40 minutes of baking, watch closely or every few minutes to finish; you may need to cover the crust edges to prevent thse from overbaking.  After baking, allow to cool fully then refridgerate for at least several hours or overnight before serving. With my alterations, 1/8 of each pie is 5 points on WeightWatchers. Worth every point!

This one deserves 5 stars.  Very rich, you only need a small piece.  I substituted cream for the milk, and used 1/3 cup instead of 1 cup, for a 9-inch pie.  Yummy!  One of our favorites now.

This is my favorite pie--AFTER I made these changes: cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, cut the milk to 1/2 cup evaporated milk. It is the perfect amount for the pie pan and the thicker batter cooks quicker. Really yummy!!!

I made this pie today, following the recipe exactly. With that said, it is not as bad as some have said. It certainly doesn't deserve 1 star. I thought it had a great lemon taste. I did have some problem with it setting up, but I put it in the frig for an hour or so after baking and cooling and it set up fine. It IS time consuming to grate all of that lemon zest. It probably took 6 lemons to get 3 TBSPNs of zest. My husband did the grating, though! Thanks for the post, we had fun making this (my 3yo patted the pie crust!), thanks for a good family kitchen memory! Note: I used REAL butter in this, not margarine. That may have something to do with people's reviews. I think real butter is needed for this kind of pie. Also, as another sidenote, my husband did not like this pie, and I almost bumped it down a star. But then he rarely likes anything I make, much less desserts, so to be fair I left my 4 star rating.(:

I followed the directions to the "t" and ended up with enough filling for two pies.  I used the regular frozen kind,  not the deep dish.  This isn't a bad thing, because the crusts are sold in 2 packs.  

I let mine sit in the fridge overnight because I like my pie cold...mmm.

It's not fair to give a recipe a bad review if you are the one who changed the ingredients-I wish everyone would remember that!

I was craving this pie and came across this recepie and it's awsome!  My in-laws's were over for dinner and they absolutely loved it.  I have to tell you that I did make a little change.  I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup of milk.  It was rich and really, really delicious.  Try it, you won't be dissapointed.

I've made this twice in the past week. My husband and I both prefer it to lemon meringue pie. I've made pies professionally for quite a few years. This recipe makes a 10 inch pie. There is too much filling for a 9 inch pie. I used 1/2 heavy cream the first time and it was almost too rich and interfered with the tart/sweet lemon flavor. The second time I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half. That is the combination we prefer. I only had 2 lemons, which made about 2 tablespoons of zest and it was plenty. You need to use butter, no substitutes. This pie is meant to be rich and sweet, combined with the unique texture from the cornmeal. Wonderful. Will be my go to lemon pie from now on. I did have to increase the baking time for a bit, but just kept an eye on it. This pie benefits from sitting for a few hours and we like it best cold.

I made this pie today and it was absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I agree that it's a "keeper".  Based on others' comments, I was concerned with having filling left over so I used a store-bought piecrust (Pillsbury) (found in the dairy case in the long skinny box) and rolled it out bigger so that it would fit in my 10" pyrex pie plate.  It ended up being perfect as I had just the right amount of filling.  I also used half and half instead of the milk and the next time I will cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.  I cooked it for 50 minutes which I think was perfect for the 10" pie and it set up very nicely in the fridge - it cut beautifully!!

Hello Carolyn, I made your lemon chess pie today.  It really turned out wonderful.  I had enough filling for 2, 8" pie pans.  I was going to save them until tommorrow, but one of them is gone already (wonder who ate all of that?).    Thanks,  Red

I love anything with lemon in it, and this recipe has all the lemon flavor and taste you could ask for. I followed the recipe to a tee the first time, but found it way too sweet, to me. I made it again and cut the sugar in half and it was perfect. It has just the right balance of tart and sweet with a custard-like texture. 5 stars and highly recommended!

W-a-y too sweet and custard-y.  We almost had to pour it out of the pan it was so loose.  Not what I was looking for in a Lemon Chess pie.

I was so excited to make this, but had a few difficulties.  I used a 9" deep dish pie crust and still had too much filling.  Even after removing 1/4 cup, it still ran over.  Also needs to bake longer... 40 minutes in my oven and it was still very liquid.  Great flavor, though... the lemon zest makes it wonderful.

Very good pie. I used the zest of one large lemon and substituted lemon oil and extract for the rest. I used half and half instead of milk for a richer taste and 1/3 cup lemon juice. I know chess pies are meant to be sweet but 2 cups of sugar would have made this pie way too sweet for my taste so I only used 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect. This recipe makes a lot of filling. I used a deep dish pie shell and still had some leftover. Will make again.

LOVE this pie. I used 1/2 cup of juice and 1 1/4 cup sugar. I think maybe it's regional to want it as sweet as this recipe is. So you might like it as sweet as it's written. I like it a little more tart.

This is my first ever chess pie, after having only read about them, and I was glad I tried this as I'm a huge lemon fan.  This will not replace my fav, lemon meringue, but for those who enjoy lemony things, this is a delight.

Don't waste your time ...it's missing some key ingredients that would make it good and it's got too much of what makes it bad (sugar and Bill Clinton's name don't help) ... try Lemon Chess II instead of this one.

This was excellent! I made this for Christmas Eve and it was fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly, allowing the top of the pie to become golden brown before removing from the oven. The center was not set when it came out of the oven. It sat on the counter cooling for a few hours and then the center was nice and firm. You cannot cut this pie when it comes straight from the oven. It is the perfect dessert after a rich, heavy meal.

Too much milk and egg to be a chess pie, but not enought to be a custard pie.  Not my favorite.  The in-laws liked it though. One extra star for them.

Flavor was very good, but the pie had to set overnight, and it was still very loose and custardy. Didn't like the texture at all. I also cut the sugar back 1/2 a cup, as 2 cups of sugar in a pie is too much for me. I only used the zest of 1.5 lemons instead of 3 tb. and that was plenty of lemon flavor. Just giving this 4 stars because of the flavor.

This was an excellent treat for a large crowd of guys on a warm day. Thank you very much!  They loved it warm. They asked for another one so the next day it was cold and they raved!  This will be made many times over!

This was excellent! For dietary reasons, I substituted oil for butter and soy milk for the milk and it worked fine. Definetly cut the sugar by at least half a cup, and I think it needs another 1/4 cup of lemon juice to give it a bit more tart flavor. This is great!

This reminded me of a Domino's pizza - it looked so delicious but the taste was very bland and disappointing.  Somehow the whole was much less than the sum of the parts - real butter, eggs, milk, real lemon juice, sugar and homemade piecrust should have been wonderful, and they just weren't.  To me the only point of dessert is to taste great, and this pie just didn't make the cut.

As other reviewers noted, there was not enough lemon flavor from 1/4 c. lemon juice, the recipe makes a lot of filling (completely filling a homemade 9" piecrust with tall crimped edges), and it takes about twice the recommended time to cook.

This may very well be Clinton's favorite pie, but my gram gave me a recipe from a cook book that belonged to her great grandmother from the early 1800's.  Never the less, this is a great and tasty pie!!!

I've just tried this recipe for the first time, and it's really terrific. Next time I might add a little more lemon zest to push the lemon flavor just a bit.  The recipe makes 1 deep-dish or 2 regular pies. It does need some time to set after baking. My 2 pies rested for about 3 hours before being served, and they set beautifully.

So easy and delicious. This makes the perfect lemon chess pie. I did allow it to bake for an extra 15 minutes or so until it set completely, and then put it in the refrigerator until it was  completely cool. Will definitely make over and over again.

Last night, I made this and another dessert for a church luncheon and if I had known how good this pie was going to turn out, I would have made two of these instead. This is a rich dessert with a pleasant lemon flavor that's not tart or overpowering. This pie would be perfect served with fresh mixed berries on the side.

My husband wanted a chess pie and I have never made one.  I looked for a good recipe and decided on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked mine for over an hour and had to cover the crust to prevent burning.  I took it out of the oven when the middle was set.  My husband really enjoyed this.  He said it isn't old fashioned chess pie like his grandmother used to make but it was still tasty.  It was very lemony, and it helped to cut the pure sugar taste of most chess pies.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was due to the cooking time and the consistency of the final product.  As you can see in my photo, the filling was still a little loose.  The pie was very hard to serve and would fall apart in a few seconds after being put on the plate.  Still tasty! Thanks for a great new twist on an old classic!

I made this for Mothers Day and it turned out lovely. I bought 2 frozen pie crusts, not deep dish! I took the suggestion and used half & half instead of milk and used 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4. I took the lazy way out and rather than zest lemons I bought lemon peel from the spice isle, I didn't have a lot of time since I had to bake it Saturday after work. I used splenda instead of sugar. Let it cook and then in the fridge overnight and took it to my mother-in-law for dinner. Everyone loved it and it cut beautifully. Since I did 2 pies it only took 35 minutes in the oven. I'll be sure and make this again!

I made this pie today on Election Day & it was easy & turned out perfect. I used a roll out Pillsbury crust in a 9 inch pie plate & cooked at 350 for 45 minutes,and it was very delicious. I used only one cup sugar (by accident but it tasted great!)& 1/2 cup of lemon (because we like it tart),real butter,& fat free milk. Great easy recipe! Thanks for sharing! (and we LOVE Bill Clinton!!) ; )

It took 50 minutes to bake to get center set, but the taste is lemony without being in your face, and sweet without being overly so.  A little tweaking next time with time and a half-recipe, and we'll be in 5-star territory. Easy and delicious.

Yummy!! Instead of a pie crust I decided to use tart shells. They were amazingly delicious. Also, I went with heavy cream  3/4 cup and 1/4 (reg)milk. Thanks for the recipe.

Good, not stellar- I used a 9 inch deep dish and all the filling and it didn't overflow at all, the pie was nice and thick.  Cooked until just the middle shook a little and took it out to cool.

This pie was very good.  I read the reviews and someone said it made two pies.  Not for my nine inch shell.  I tried it in two shells, not enough in either, so i poured one into the other, thus the entire recipe and made one pie in a nine inch shell.  I baked it ten minutes more, tested it with a knife, that came out clean and it came out the perfect texture.  Just the right amount of sweet and tart.  Everyone liked it at the Thanksgiving dinner.

This pie is delicious!  I increase the lemon juice to 1/3 or 1/2 cup because I like a more lemony flavor.  Someone reviewed this recipe recently saying it was kinda dry.  The person must have messed up the recipe because I've made this many, many times and it has NEVER been anywhere close to dry.  The pie filling part remains pretty gelatinous.

Very yummy!  I cut the sugar down to 1-1/4 cup, that was still a little too sweet for my tastes.  I had a nice "custardy" texture.  I also mad a fresh lemon whipped cream to serve with it.   Also, it makes 1-9" deep dish pie.

This was just okay for us. I decided to make this as written and although the flavor wasn't bad (other than being way  sweet)the texture was really strange. It's not really like a custard but rather mushy. After reading other reviews, i had 2 crusts ready to go and didn't have nearly enough filling for both. One deep dish pie would have been perfect. I probably will not make this again. Sorry Bill!

This pie was very simple to make, set up well, and cuts nicely.  But it had very little lemon taste and was a bit too sweet for my taste.  (I did cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.)  For curiosity's sake, I looked up "chess pie," and found it has NO connection to chess, but may have developed from a cheese tart.  Or, when someone asked, "Hey, what kind of pie is this?" the answer was, "It's just pie," which became "jus' pie" and finally corrupted to "chess pie."  In my opinion it's OK, but it's just pie, not really a spectacular lemon pie.

I had been looking for a recipe for chess pie for years and when I came across this one I figured to give a try.  It was a nice twist from the basic chess pie I tried in the past.  It is a winner!

I can't count how many times I've made this pie for various dinners & family, outings, and it's ALWAYS come out perfect!
But I do cut down the amount of sugar by half a cup. (It doesn't need to be THAT sweet)

Perfect!  My office raved!  Top seemed a bit overly browned, but seemed to provide an almost-caramel-crispy topping.  Fabulous lemon flavor!

Yep, made it several times and used buttermilk in lieu of the milk or 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 half'n'half.  Pretty creamy stuff. Used 1/2 teaspoon intense natural lemon extract with the zest. All these little changes are fine. Only commnent otherwise is the oven setting may be too high and the time too short. I moved it back to 300F and let it cook 20 min longer and it really set up. At 350F and 40minutes it didn't set up in the center.  Also when you lower an oven setting and increase the cook time, more H2O evaporates and that contributes to the custard to set easily. But not an issue really.

I took previous advice and upped the lemon juice to 1/2 cup and made TWO 9" pies (I used frozen store-bought crusts).

This was delicious and cooling! I took these to work and got a lot of compliments. Chess pie is not common here in Missouri, but had quite a few co-workers enjoy them.

It may have been the crusts I used, but the longer-than-normal baking times did something magical to the crusts, they tasted more like shortbread. Yum!

Amazing, amazing, amazing. I made this for Thanksgiving and received rave reviews. Like some of the other reviews noted...this recipe makes one DEEP DISH pie perfectly! If using regular size pie shells, plan on making either two pies or having left over filling.

After a very busy day & trying to teach my daughter Abigail to make pies. I had some leftover pie crust &  decided to whip this up. Much to my dismay after it completed cooking I discovered I completely forgot the milk! :/  It was delicious even though it lacked the ingredient for making it a custard!

Wow!! This was wonderful! My tweeks were, only had about 1 1/2 tbsp of lemon zest and had a little over 1/4 cup of lemon juice from 4 small lemons. I did have to cook it about 55 minutes before the knife came out clean but the only downfall with that is we had to wait longer!

This was good - definitely needs to sit for a while before eating. I thought it needed to be more lemony but others were fine with it.

This pie is very sweet.  My husband loved it.  The texture is great and it set up very well.  I doubled the recipe and made three pies.  I prefer the Creamy Lemon Pie made with Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed milk but my hubby preferred this one.

I made this recipe for the first time last Thanksgiving, and it was such a hit that it will certainly be a tradition from now on! My only change was to reduce the amount of lemon zest to 2 tablespoons.  Move over lemon meringue!

I made this for a Pi Day celebration (March 14!) and it was a huge hit. I had never made a custard pie before and this one came out great. As others have mentioned, it does make more than 1 pie (I used two store bought deep-dish Mrs. Smith's) so be preparred.

This was a great surprise. It looked strange as it was mixed, did not look smooth at all. I did not think it will be successful. Much to my happy surprise, it was amazing. I used 1 cup of sugar only and 3/4 milk, and added 1/4 extra lemon like someone else suggested. I had the perfect amount for a deep dish pie. It was delicious, will make again for sure.

It was not a hit with my family at all for the Thanksgiving holidays.  Very disappointing; my daughter Love "Lemon Chess Pie" and she was not happy at all.  She told me not to try a this reciepe again, just stick with the family one that I usually make.  I'm not a fan but it was awful.

Very lemony pie. I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was the first dessert to go.   Be careful of the cooking time. My pie was still jiggly at 40 minutes, so I left it for 4 more minutes. It was over baked and cracked deeply when it cooled. Still great, though.

I love this pie, made a few times. I would describe it as lemon curd pie, those scone lovers out there...you know what that means! Taste better the second day. If you want a real lemony flavor, less sugar, by about half and meyer lemons. Wow! Great!

Did what another suggested: instead of one pie, replace milk with half and half and increase lemon juice to 1/2 cup - used lemon zest of 2 large lemons. EXCELLENT ! Smooth, creamy, just excellent. THANK YOU

Very nice lemon flavor. We gave it five stars.   Need a large 9 inch pie shell or can make two smaller pies (reducing cooking time).  I will be making this again.  Thaks for posting.

Good pie! If you are using a regular 9 inch pie crust, take note of JANET BURGIN's review warning that this recipe makes enough filling for 2 crusts. If I were to make this again, I would probably use half and half instead of milk, and use more lemon zest. Other than that, this was pretty good! Thanks, Carolyn!

This is the easiest and most delicious pie I have made.  I have a 10-inch pie plate and I used it to make this recipe and I orignally thought it might come out to "thin" no way it was perfect.  I took it to church for a luncheon and it was a big hit!

This was absolutely wonderful.  It deserves more than a mere 5 stars.  Made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it was great.  I did use a 9" deep-dish shell though since most reviewers seemed to think there was too much batter for a regular 9" crust.  For those who think it's too sweet, it's a chess pie...it's SUPPOSED to be sweet.  After all, the main ingredients in a chess pie are lots of sugar and lots of eggs.  For those reviewers who had problems with the recipe, all I can say is "learn how to follow directions".

This is the best recipe!!I give it 5 gold stars!! I would say, just make sure that you use fresh lemons for the lemon zest and use EXACTLY 1/4 cup of the fresh squeezed lemon juice!(no more or less!) I used a store bought Deep Dish pie shell and this pie turned out great, (which was nice considering I made it for company!).This pie is delicious and quick and easy too make!! A pie recipe (originating in the South) its a wonderful custardy ,lemony pie that has the right balance of sweet & tart! When I make this pie,this is always the recipe I use!  2 Enthusiastic Thumbs Up! TRY IT ~ YOU'LL LIKE IT!!

I have tried several different lemon chess pie recipes until I found this one. My family and friends love this pie. This Thanksgiving I made 2 of them and they were gone while there were leftovers of the rest of the pies.

I have made this pie for the second time today.  I am glad I read the reviews before making it the first time. I used my French White Quiche dish (10inch X 3inch) and it is PERFECT fit for the entire recipe. I love anything lemon. I loved my grandmother's Chess Pie.  A total winner~! I serve it with 'real' whipped cream and sliced strawberries and a spring of mint.  A crowd pleaser~!  Thanks~! I do have to increase the baking time by about 10 to 12 minutes. No problem in setting-up and it comes out the same color as the picture used in this recipe.

Yes this is a awesome chess pie. I double up on the lemon flavor and before cooling in the refrigerator I put a little more lemon juice on top of the pie to settle in more flavor.

I left off the corn meal. To compensate, I used 1/2 cup of milk.

This was very good! I took the advice of other reviews by increasing the lemon juice to 1/2 cup. It tasted great--not too tart and not too sweet; the flavor of the lemon really shined. My only caveat is that my pie did not look nearly as "pretty" as the display picture. Instead of a smooth custard, mine appeared grainy, even though it did cut cleanly. Perhaps I didn't mix it enough. All said, 5 stars for my new go-to lemon pie.

This recipe is wonderful.  I did modify it as follows:  Added 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4, and reduced milk to 1/3 cup.   In addition I added a teaspoon of lemon juice and 1/3 cup of sour cream.    I baked in a wide, deep-dish pie shell and the amount of pie filling was perfect.

My crust came out soggy a litte soggy in spots, but thats my fault. I did not know that I need to bake the crust a few minutes before putting in the filling. Also I think it is because the butter content of the filling. I will make again but I think I will, cut down the butter and use cream the next time I make this pie.

This was pretty good.  If I could add a half star I would.  If I make this again I'll use cream instead of milk as another reviewer suggested, and reduce the amount of sugar a bit.

Have never made a home made lemon chess pie until tonight.  Followed the recipe pretty closely because of the reviews.
Reduced the sugar by 1/3 c. but think 1/2 c. reduction would bring out the lemon flavor more.  Also, had a deep dish pie crust that I did not thaw and it cooked perfectly including the edges.  There is to much liquid so next time I'll reduce the  quantity of milk by half (I used fat free half and half because it's what I had.)  Also, even though the photo shows a more custard type layer at the top I didn't expect that and was looking for a more smooth consistency throughout.  Going to refrigerate and let it firm up some.  This needs to bake the day before you need it.  The flavor was nice lemony but very sweet.

The pie was good. It just wasn't tart enough for me.
I really like for the lemon flavoring  to be tart.
 Also,  it made a nice full 9 inch pie.  
Check the size of your pie pan. Most of the pie pans at your local
grocery store are smaller than 9 inches.

I make this pie at least once a month. The only thing I change is I always top it with shredded coconut and sometimes I add 1 cup of loose shredded coconut. I have given out this recipe at least 50 times, that is how much everyone loves it.

Awesome pie! I would recommend using a deep dish pie pan as this overflowed my regular pan. No worries though, I simply ladled some into a small casserole and baked it along with the pie. I  didn't miss the crust at all.

I had not had chess pie in years and had an uncontrollable urge to bake this pie.  It was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste. I don't know that I'll make it again, but if I do, I will certainly cut the sugar.

Excellent lemon flavor & custard-y texture, altering only by using no milk & 1/4cup freshly squeezed lemon juice. Perfect for one 10" deep dish pie with a high, fluted edge.

Good but not quite as good as I'd hoped. Everyone liked it but I'm not sure people would ask for it. Pumpkin pie and "French Coconut Pie" were the big winners at our Thanksgiving. This did beat out cookies and cherry fluff. I expect this varies a lot though depending on the quality of one's lemons.

Very good, very easy. I made it with Meyer lemons, so I took the suggestions of some posters by increasing the juice and cutting back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. It was lemon-y but very mild. I made it the night before I needed it and left it in the refrigerator overnight, and the texture was just right.

Great  Recipe!! Used a 10 inch deep dish.   Took longer to bake about 20 mins. It was  first pie to go. No leftovers.

Really enjoyed this, with a few adaptations. Definitely sweet enough with 1-1/2 cups sugar instead of 2. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and added an extra tablespoon of zest. Also added a few splashes of vanilla extract. Next time we might substitute cream for the milk.
One recipe was plenty to fill a deep dish pie shell, although it did take longer to heat. 40 minutes was not enough (we used a toaster/convection oven). I kept an eye on it and ended up cooking about 55 minutes. Top was nicely browned but not burnt. Filling was still soupy but pie set nicely after resting on the counter for a while. We tried the first piece while still slightly warm. Delicious & perfectly tart. Pie did weep a bit, but not a problem (and I bet it won't do again once refrigerated).
I hope it's not apocryphal that this is one of Bill Clinton's favorites. We made it to console ourselves after the debacle of the 2016 election.

This came out exactly how I wanted it to. Very simple and yummy! Do get the deep dish crust, or you will need two regular.

This is my favorite pie, and when I moved from my hometown, I couldn't find it.  This recipe gave me my favorite pie back.  Now this is my entire family's favorite pie.

I had no idea what to expect as I'd never tried chess pie before, let alone making it from scratch. I was confused about the instruction to bake  until set. I baked this nearly twice as long and it never set in the middle. The top did get a deep golden brown, which I thought was good from the pictures. However, the top spongy part was too thick in the end. The custard was ok, but grainy from the corn meal. It was edible only because of the strong lemon flavor.  I don't think I like this kind of pie in general, but the lemon saved this one. Yet another Southern thing I don't get!

I loved this pie - a big  hit at my house. It was rich, creamy, lemon-y.  I made a few tweaks - I used 2T of cornmeal and eliminated the flour. I had 4 lemons which was more than enough lemon juice but yielded only about 1.5T of zest and I added a tiny drop of vanilla. Mine took a little longer to bake at 50 min but was picture perfect coming out of the oven. I made this yesterday and am eager to make it again even though I've got half the pie left in the fridge.

I have made this pie ever since it was first posted. It has become a must have for the holidays.The only change I have ever made was to use Splenda rather than sugar. Makes 2 pies.

I followed the directions exactly, used real butter and everything...but this turned out so greasy-buttery for me, and the texture was odd - as another reviewer said, it's like it's trying to be a hybrid of a chess and a custard pie, but not really succeeding at either. Plus, there wasn't enough lemon flavor as others have said. Thanks for the recipe; it wasn't bad, but I think I will look for another lemon chess pie to better suit my personal preferences.

I used 1 cup sugar instead of 2 cups, and 1/2 cup passion fruit juice instead of 1/4 cup lemon juice. I decreased the amount of milk to 3/4 cup. I'm glad I took others' advice to decrease the sugar; it was sweet enough with the changes.  Tastes way better after it's been chilled.  I will definitely make it again.

Very good, great flavor, it does make quite a bit more than a 9" pie shell, tried a deep dish and still had left over filling. Will make again probably trying the extra juice and two pie shells.

This recipe was fantastic!!!  I personally would give it 5 stars because I love lemon- to the point of scraping off the meringue on a lemon meringue pie.  However it was a little too overpowering for my husband and a friend who also like lemon but aren't as fanatical as myself.  I halved the recipe as other reviewers advised and it was the perfect amount for my 9" crust.

Very good recipe - I followed the earlier suggestion of using two smaller pie shells, worked out perfectly.

The only challenge for me was getting the 3 tablespoons of lemon zest. I ended up scrapping too deep and got some of the white membrane from the lemon and that made the pies a tad bit sour.

Great recipe, but it makes TWO pies!!  This is exactly like my Grandma's lemon bars she used  to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used half and half instead of milk and my whole family loved them.  Thanks!!

This pie was excellent- I made both this pie and the "lemon chess pie I" at the same time and this pie was tops! I did add some lemon zest and used evaporated milk for a little more creaminess. Got rave reviews.
