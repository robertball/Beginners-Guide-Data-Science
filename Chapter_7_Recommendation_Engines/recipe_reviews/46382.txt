My husband ( who is not a meatloaf lover) thought this was the best meatloaf he has had yet. i thought it was good but was quit a bit too sweet. I also thought it had too much bread crumbs. next time I make it i will only add a tbsp. of brown sugar and maybe half the amount of breadcrumbs. the peaches suprisingly taste very well with the meat!

B ecause of this recipe I became a member today. I thought it was a strange recipe and thats is exactly why I had to try it and hands down it was one of the most unique meals I have ever had. After I made it I had to call me mom and tell her about it as a matter of fact I'll be making it for her to try I called my bestfriend as well. I'll be making this one over and over again. I love meatloaf and I love peaches so this was GREAT!!!!

What a neat combo!  I made it for my parents and we all enjoyed the interesting twist on meatloaf.  I used fresh peaches instead of canned and it still tasted amazing.

This recipe didn't sound very good but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try, plus I have a ton of fresh peaches. I had to use 2 lbs of ground beef because a 1 lb meatloaf is just not enough for my family. I ran out of breadcrumbs at 3/4 cup so I used enough French fried onions to make 1 cup and I used 1 cup of chopped sweet onions. I used fresh peaches sliced with the skin on and I doubled the sauce. It was really good. Hubby said it was okay, but my one son and I both loved it (my other son refuses to eat meat loaf, period). I will definitely make this again.

As is 3 stars.  Recommended changes:  Do not form the meat loaf as directed otherwise you will have a big pool of fat on top of your meatloaf. Just form like a traditional meatloaf.  Skip using sliced peaches and use a peach preserve instead. I think this balances out the meatloaf to sweetness ratio better.

I made this last night for company and got rave reviews.  Everyone took seconds. The loaf is a little denser than I normally prefer but wasn't a problem.  I used 8 small fresh peaches and mixed the slices in with the sauce.  I used only 1/2 tsp of salt which was plenty.  I shaped it into a normal meatloaf (with the indentation in the center to hold peaches &  sauce).  I just couldn't see where all the juices and fat were going to go other than the bottom of my oven otherwise.   I prepared it a bit ahead of time (about 1.5 hrs), and reheated for dinner. After cooking, I found the loaf solid enough to easily transfer it to a serving platter without mishap. Oh, last thought - I couldn't see the point of pricking the uncooked meatloaf with a fork before baking.  Meatloaf by its very nature is a permeable thing.  However, I can see pricking it before adding the peaches and sauce - although I didn't bother.  Fresh peaches tasted fresh: even after baking and reheating there was no doubt these were fresh peaches.  We got to talking about how compatible fruit and meat are: turkey/cranberry sauce, ham/pineapple and so on.  Peaches and meatloaf is a great combination.  Thanks for the post, I'll be making this again. BTW - I served it with mashed potatoes & caramelized onions, homemade baked beans and fresh tomatoes.

This was so good and so easy. The meatloaf turned out juicy and the peaches were a perfect complement. Even better the second day. I doubled the sauce topping because it just didn't seem like enough. I also added about a teaspoon of ginger and I might even add a little more next time but my husband and I loved it and it's going in the recipe rotation!

This sounded so weird, we just HAD to try it! Everyone LOVED this at my house. It is a great new twist to plain meatloaf. There is just something about that sweet peach flavor-I did still get the typical complaints about onions from my kids (what is it with kids and onions?) but everyone went back for seconds (and thirds). A+ recipe! We will use this regularly

This is a great recipe. I chose it because I know my fiance loves meatloaf and peaches, although we've never eaten them together! :-)  All that was available in the store when I went was a combo ground beef & pork, but it was still delicious. Although my fiance was a little "suspicious" of a fruit and meat "pie" at the beginning, he was won over when he took the first bite. The sauce really makes everything go together well. I'm definitely going to make this again. Thanks!!

I made this last night and I was only going to give this a 3 star because my husband and I thought it was a little too sweet.  The only changes I made was I used Splenda brown sugar because my husband is a diabetic and like another person before me I used a ready made dairy pie crust because I had it on hand.  I had 3/4's left over so I brought it to work today.  2 of my co workers loved it and asked for the recipe.  1 of my coworkers liked the flavor of the sauce but didn't care for the peaches on top.   Because of the rave reviews at work I gave it a 4 star.  I won't make it again because I really like my regular meatloaf a lot.  I tried this for a change of pace.

The meatloaf and sauce were really good.  Next time I make this I will double the sauce and leave the peaches for dessert.  Hubby and I are really having a great time trying new recipes since I found ALLRECIPES.COM.  I'm glad we tried this, cause now we know for sure you CAN teach old dogs new tricks.  This is making our life a lot more interesting.  After 47 years of cooking for the same man we now have something new an different to look forward to every now and then.  Thanks again, Diana

I'm not usually a fan of meatloaf so I thought I'd try something different and I was definitely pleased!  Loved the taste of the peaches with the meat...great combo.  The only thing I did different was use a pie crust, which I also really loved.  Will be making this again as my new meatloaf recipe.  Thank you!

This was really good. We enjoyed the pairing of peaches and ground beef. And, the sweet and sour sauce is my favorite for meatloaf. However, I do not think it serves 8. Maybe 4 at best. Barely that if you have a family full of rapidly growing boys with big appetites! Thanks for the recipe, it made for a unique meal.

This definitely had a neat taste to it.  Was a little bit salty.  I would probably make it again.  It's just like a sweet meatloaf.

Absolutely Delicious. I was a bit skeptical at first but after just following the original recipe, it turned out great. It was a nice sweet flavor.. I may experiment with Pinaple slices too. But that's just like a Hawaiian Burger. Anyways it was great! Will pass it on to others and definately use it again!

I'm a retired Navy Chief and took up cooking in 98 as a hobby. I was a bit skeptical about the peaches and ground beef, but it turned out great. I invited 2 friends over for lunch and the whole pie was gone in 20 minutes. Excellant recipe. :o))

AMAZING is the word my son and husband used to describe this! I wanted to find something 'different' and boy this was it and was surprisingly delicious! I would have NEVER imagined this one up. Great Job!

Great recipe. The meat crust is a good meatloaf, quite "creamy" thanks to the milk, and the sauce gives the pie a nice light bbq flavour. Pretty impressive, since very few people expect a meatloaf to look like a pie.

Made this wonderful meatloaf last night and my husband coudn't stop talking about it all night. I made the recipe as is...no customizing. I didn't think the amount vinegar was over powering. The only problem I had was the pool of grease after cooking the meat. I drained as much as I could but still ended up with a small pool after complete cooking period. Still...an absolute delight and a welcomed upgrade to the normal meatloaf. Who knew that peaches and meatloaf would taste soooo good together. Thanks Diana.

Not much of a ground beef lover but
this dish has changed my mind.
The flavors mask the ground
meat taste.

I sure wish I could remember who mentioned this on the buzz! I immediately thought of my mom when I saw it [though I got a funny look from her when I told her what was cooking (=] I tweaked it a bit. I used a 20 oz ground turkey. And when I got to Mom's house, I found my onion had gone bad )= so I replaced it with green onion (= I put 2 slices of whole grain bread in the blender for the bread crumbs. I used extra lean ground turkey, and was a bit surprised to have a puddle of fat on the pie when I pulled it out of the oven - but it was easy enough to simply pour it off. I used balsamic vinegar in the sauce - that was SO good! There were four of us, and everyone loved it (= I wanted to use diced peaches, but there weren't any at the store. I would still use diced next time, if I can find them - or chop my slices into smaller pieces.

Amazing!  Strange but delicious!  A family favourite already.  I used very lean beef and got a lot of fluid; solved the problem by substituting the 1 cup bread crumbs with a quarter cup Bulgur wheat.  I also add a finely grated carrot to the beef mix; reduce the sugar to 3 tablespoons - dark brown sugar.

We made this several times and it was as a big hit each time.  The first time I used fresh Red Haven peaches, and when they are in season, that is the way to go.  The peaches were a bit hard and that was great. In the winter  we use canned peaches and that is almost as good. 5 stars either way.

This was good, because I like meatloaf, but it didn't stand out among meatloaves. 

The peaches go well with ground beef, it's true, but I think I like regular meatloaf better. IT was a nice change, however.

Really good and really different.  I, too, used fresh peaches instead of canned and really liked it, although I wasn't too crazy about the "texture" of the meat.  Too creamy.  The peaches really dress is up, however.  The kids did not particularly care for this recipe.  However, I will make again, particularly when peaches are in season.

After reading the other reviews, I was really looking forward to this recipe. My meatloaf was nice and juicy, but the canned peaches didn't do it for me, although I see the potential, and the combo tasted good. I'd be curious to try it with fresh peaches. Now THAT would be yummy!

This is such a good recipe... It was a little dry but so dealable... I would cut down the cooking time 7-10 minutes tops! The sweet went great with the ground beef! I would make it again!

Very tasty!  The kids cleaned their plates and it was perfect for a non-meatloaf lover like me.  I did however use ground turkey and I think it could have cooked a bit less.  It's going in my keep 'em recipe book.  Thanks!

My family really enjoyed this recipe! I thought the kids would turn their noses up, but there were no leftovers, so that's a good sign!

To lighten it up, next time I'll use ground turkey in place of some of the beef.

My whole family loved this recipe (even the ones that never touch a piece of fruit!) It was so easy to make and reminded me a bit of "french meat pie" though not quite as rich. This would be a fun one to bring to pot luck suppers because it is so unsual.

This was the best meatloaf recipe I have come across.  It is very moist and the sauce compliments the peaches and meat.  I used fresh peaches and we did not find it overly sweet.  My husband went back for seconds.  A great recipe and I highly recommend it.

My DH made this for dinner over the weekend and we thought it was a little weird.  The meatloaf wasn't bad - and the peaches weren't bad....but the combination of the two ingredients together didn't jive with our tastes; so some people might like it, it's not for us.

Very good recipe, but I used a ground beef that had too much fat content. Next time I will use a leaner beef. My husband wrinkled his nose at it when he heard that there were peaches on it, but he loved it!!!

This is a very interesting combination - peaches & beef.  It was cooking when my husband came home and he said either it's gonna be really good or really nasty.  Well, it was really good.  The only thing I didn't have was onions but it still tasted good.  It's a pie shaped meatloaf with peaches on top.  Very good!

Very tasty and easy to make.  My nine-year old was a bit disconcerted with the peach/beef combination but she did eat it all!  Definitely a keeper!

My husband thought this would be excellent, because of his love for odd for.  And though it wasnt all that bad.. it was just meatloaf with peaches on top.

We loved this!  I made this out of curiousity---peaches and meatloaf?  But it was delicious.  It is the best meatloaf recipe I've come across, nice and moist, and a nice twist with the peaches.  My husband and kids loved it, and I made it for my parents and they loved it.  My father-in-law loves peaches in any form, so I'm trying this for my in-laws tonight.  This isn't a particularly fancy dish, but a great deviation from regular old meatloaf and worth a try!!

This sounded like a strange combination, but I was curious to try it. I found it overly sweet and the peaches and meat didn't seem to pair well.

Based on the other reviews I read I thought this dish would be really unique . . .but it just tasted like meatloaf and peaches.  Neither my husband nor I could eat more than one piece, ended up throwing the rest out.

Very Good! Used FRESH peaches sliced thin.  Also, added 1/2 c. chpd red pepper & 1 1/2 T. Worcestershire sauce to loaf mixture.  Increased gr. beef to 1 1/4 lb.  Increased ketchup & vinegar a bit (used raspbery blush vinegar).  Baked in a 10 1/2" quiche dish.  A lovely presentation!  The subtle sweet & sour sauce complimented the peaches & meatloaf to make a tasty dish.  Highly recommend!

This was good, but nothing spectacular.  I will probably not make this one again.  The peaches and the brown sugar gave it a nice sweet taste.

When going thru recipes, I kept passing this one over thinking it's weird but I'll try it someday.  Someday came today and it is so easy. It's a tad too sweet for me, but picky eater daughter loves it and grandkids will eat it. I have to admit that it's tasty and goes well with boiled potatoes and plain green beans.

Admittedly a bizarre concept, but it works wonderfully. So glad I tried it, the entire family loved it including my 21/2 year old granddaughter who dislikes meatloaf.

Made a few modifications: Doubled the ground beef (but kept recipe quantities of filler ingredients and seasonings.) used fresh peaches, skinned and thinly sliced. Doubled the glaze ingredients and used apple cider vinegar. Added about 1/4 tsp dry mustard to the glaze.

Don't be put off by this unusual pairing of meat and fruit. The recipe is quite simple and very tasty.

We loved this twist on our usual meatloaf made with applesauce—the Betty Crocker one from the 60’s.  I formed the  beef mixture into a round and baked it in a brownie pan. I did need to spoon off some juices st the halfway mark.  II used fresh peaches, which are wonderful here in August and made for a great and easy meal.

I was skeptical but curious enough to try it and it is a keeper. Hubby doesn't care for peaches but he ate two helpings of this. I served with loaded potatoes pancakes and roasted vegetables and it paired well with both. Very good!  Will be making this again.

I like meatloaf and this was extraordinary. I had wanted to use some ground bison and this worked very well. I had to adjust the cooking time,  since it was fully cooked at 25 minutes when I drained it, so I put it on low broil for 8 minutes to soften the peaches. I used balsamic vinegar and my peaches were in juice, not heavy syrup, so I added some of the juice. It was amazing and everyone loved it that tried it in my very picky family.

This was a GREAT idea! The peaches go with the beef very well. This is a great way to make that meatloaf different and good enough to come back for more.....the leftovers are better the next day.

This is a keeper.  Didn't want to waste the peach juice from the can, so used that instead of the milk.  I didn't have soft bread crumbs so I used 1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs.  Used 2 tblsp brown sugar instead of 1/4 cup.

To quote a dear friend "Who'd a thunk it?"  Peaches on Meatloaf!!!  I made it as written except used a 10" deep dish pie pan so the grease would have someplace to go. Hubby loved it; it was just a bit sweet for me.  It won't replace our usual meatloaf but I'll make it again and I think I'll sub chili sauce for the ketchup.
