If I could give this recipe 6 stars I would.  These are awesome.  Such a delicious twist on the plain old krispie treats!  If you use a 13x9 pan, as suggested in the recipe, it will fill the entire pan and make big tall krispie treats, but if you want them a little smaller, divide it up into 2 13x9 pans.  I ended up cutting tall ones in half to serve...but either way, they are wonderful.  Thanks MrsFisher!!

Super yummy of course with all the butter, brown sugar, cream, of course it's amazing.  My question is with the photo.  Where did the thick top layer come from?  Is it extra sauce?  I'm guessing you stir in 1/2 the sauce then use other 1/2 for the topping.  We popped some popcorn and used the extra sauce for that.

Almost too delicious!  Only variation is I used a can of sweetened condensed milk that I cooked in crockpot first, for the caramel sauce. Then added marshmallows and Rice Krispies!

I am a rice crispy lover, I don't know that I will be making them any other way! My family can't stop eating them! Worth (at the very least) trying once!

I was making a second batch before the first one had cooled.  My daughter needed a snack for a class at school.  I came across this recipe and after reading the rave reviews, decided to try it out.  AMAZING!!!  This is my first review as well.   It is that good, and I will definitely make this again!

Believe the reviews on this one!  I couldn't find flaked sea salt so used fine Pink Himalayan sea salt.  I wasn't sure if I needed to adjust amounts so added 1/2 teaspoon at a time and tasted after each addition.  I ended up using the full 2 teaspoons and it was perfect.  I used a 13x9 pan and also a 9x9 to get the height that I thought was good.  My finished bars were a titch over an inch high.  Everyone asked for the recipe on this one.  They still taste like Rice Krispie bars, but subtly and wonderfully different.  Great recipe!!

Excellent! I couldn't find gluten free cereal but made anyway. You can easily use a 16oz box of cereal without getting too dry. We also made a batch using toasted coconut marshmallows and topped with toasted unsweetened coconut.  We won't ever make them the old way from the cereal box recipe.  We've made 6 batches for Christmas treats to give away.

12 oz. cereal does not mean 12 ounces per your measuring cup, it means a whole box.  If you are going with a 12 fluid ounce measurement, you will have to run to the store for more cereal, which is a bummer when you are cooking.

The family members who made this gave it two stars (see above) but the people who ate it gave it 4s and 5s.  You absolutely need all the salt--otherwise it is ridiculously sweet (probably too sweet if you substitute the sweetened condensed like one reviewer suggested).

This recipe was fantastic, the caramel sauce was really decadent. But it seemed like I had too much marshallow caramel sauce, but not enough cereal, 12 oz of rice krispies was not enough. Maybe I measured the cereal wrong? I dont know, but it was still delicious, and I will make them again.

I never write reviews but I HAD to for this one.  I've tried a few dessert recipes with a caramel sauce before and I've never had one turn out as good as this one! This recipe is amazing for the salted caramel sauce alone.  The only change I made was to use cocoa krispies for a chocolate taste, otherwise this recipe is perfect!

Oh my word! These are delicious! If you have a major sweet tooth (like I do) you will love these! I used a 12" x 15" glass pan, and the height was perfect for me. I can see where putting this in a 13 x 9 would make very tall bars. I love how these are sweet and salty all in one bite. Will make again!

These were really good - just make sure you use a 12 oz box of cereal; not 12 ounces measured in a cup.

I've made these many times. They are beyond awesome. I will, as others have said never go back again. Soooo, on another note, I made these for adults adding a little (maybe1/4 cup) of Brandy to the Carmel mixture. I can't begin to express how incredibly good they were. Way over the top!!!!

I took these to a pot luck and everyone there loved them.  I used salted butter so cut down on the salt.  Used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup molasses sugar.  Mix them in a very large bowl or in a roasting pan because they cool quickly and become very hard to stir.
Will make this recipe over and over again and have shared it with friends as well.

I found these to be heavy and for the extra calories and ingredients just not worth it. I'll stick to the original.

Awesome.  Gourmet rice krispie treats.  Next time I make them, I may cut back on the butter.  I used one 9 x 13 pan and they came out two inches thick.  The sea salt flakes are worth it.

I made these today for a Superbowl gathering. I halved the recipe and still used a 9X13, worked just fine. They are very goey. I added some vanilla as well. The sweet and salty combo is a hit. Yummy!

Believe the star on this one.  Made it for a Superbowl party and it was a huge hit.  The only change I made was that I used regular sea salt instead of flaked but it was perfectly fine with the listed measurements.

Sometimes I am in the mood for rice krispy treats, but I am also feeling a little fancy. This recipe is great for that, and is always well received (also, when I need to bring something potluck-style, this isn't as much effort as a lot of other things that I do). This recipe is very good, but don't be afraid of the salt, as the salt really makes the whole thing pop. I would use the full amount of that for sure to get the best result.

I melted 1/4 cup butter with 1 cup milk chocolate chips & spread in the bottom of the prepared pan (I used 2 cookie pans) then followed the directions exactly. I used a small heart shaped cookie cutter for valentines. I put the scraps in a bowl for the family to enjoy & wrapped the hearts for giving away. Everyone loved them it’s definitely a keeper I will make them again.

Omg!! If I could give these 10 stars,  I would.  They are absolutely deliciously evil! 
I made extra sauce just to put on top.  I might try these with chocolate glaze on top as well.  
I added a bit extra salt for the top. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! Very yummy!

I made some changes based off of what I had on hand and also split the recipe between two 9x13 pans. They were a nice thickness. I did not use any corn syrup and used pink Himalayan salt, as I didn't have any sea salt. I left one pan plain but the other pan I melted a bag of milk chocolate chips to spread over the top. Both were delicious, but the chocolate topped ones were the bigger hit.

This is an awesome, easy gluten free dessert, and a nice "upscale" version of rice krispy bars.

Unfortunately, the cost of gluten-free rice krispies in my area run around $9.00 a box.  So I substituted for vanilla chex mix.  I found that I had too much goop in the syrup side for this cereal, and it made the recipe super sweet.  Small amounts okay to eat, but I imagine with 'real' rice krispies it might work.

Made these for my wife's popcorn potluck and they were a homerun.

I subbed butterscotch morsels for brown sugar and popcorn for the rice cereal.

We haven't seen the last of this recipe.

How do you get the carmel layer on top?  Picture does not match end result!

These were really good!  However as someone else mentioned, the picture is misleading as there is no mention of putting the mixture on top so it just all gets mixed in.  I used 35% cream to try and cut down on the calories, it did not thicken as much as it probably should have, but made no difference. Yummy ?? !

I call these Kryptonite because when I make them my healthy eating super powers are immediately gone and I must eat half the pan. Totally ridiculous. 

DO split these into 2 9x13 pans so they are easier to cut.

I made this for a work function and people were devouring them! now its a staple in my house! Only tip might be to add 1 teaspoon of salt and then add more salt on the top according to your preference!

I couldn't find GF rice cereal so I used GF honey corn flakes.  Other than being very gooey they were delicious!  Many people were asking for the recipe.

Took these to a potluck lunch, where there were gluten intolerant people, and they disappeared!  Loved them.  I added what was left of a bag of butterscotch chips (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup), and 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup shredded coconut.

My family loved this! Delicious variation. Only thing I did not like was the photo - misleading - thought the caramel topping shown in photo would have been included in the recipe.

Holy cow! This is so good! I have not made regular rice crispy treats since. The recipe is not difficult, and oh so good! My son and his college friends request this all the time. Thanks for a great variation on a classic recipe.

OMG!  Beware addictive personalities--this is so amazingly good, you can't have just one.  Served this today to 5 colleagues, one of whom begged to take the rest of the treats home so she could have them all to herself.  Made the entire recipe and split it between a 9x9 pan and a 7x11 pan and it made 24 very big pieces.  Made with 'brown rice'  crispy rice cereal the treats were very attractive looking.
