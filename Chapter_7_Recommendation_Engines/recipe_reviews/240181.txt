The lady at the deli counter LIED when she said this salad was difficult to make. Simple and delicious. Best when it gets a chance to it a few hours, so the raisins can absorb some of the juicy goodness. DEFINITELY will make this again!

I like this old fashion recipe better than the ones with added ingredients.

This is my go to recipe for carrot salad.  Depending on my mood I prepare it as written or jazz it up by adding additional ingredients like hulled sunflower seeds, pineapple, diced apple, or coconut.  Have never measured the mayo...but...Suspect  that my tastes call for well over 2 tablespoons.

I was looking forward to this recipe. Unfortunately, it was just okay. I made the dressing exactly as stated, but then doubled it as it was not enough to moisten the carrot mixture.

Nice because it's not sweet.  The lemon and salt are nice.

I did not have enough raisins, so I added some dried cranberries to make up the difference.  Also added more mayo than called for; I like carrot salad on the creamy side.  And for good measure, I added a squeeze of honey for a bit more sweetness.  Love the salad.

It was pretty good. I used organic rainbow carrots, dried cranberries and the dressing as per the recipe. Although I think Iâ€™ll add just a pinch of sugar in the dressing next time.
