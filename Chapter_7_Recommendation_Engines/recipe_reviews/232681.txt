My husband mostly made this recipe since he is the grill man. He followed the recipe ingredients including some good shakes of the Chinese five spice, garlic powder, and onion powder. We marinated our tenderloins for 8 hours (cutting the two into four 2-inch thick loins). He cooked this on the charcoal grill over indirect heat as directed, but He kept the water pan in the whole time. The loins being only 2 inches thick reached 145° in 40 minutes, so watch your time. I cooked the remaining marinade on the stove-top, adding in some cornstarch to thicken it and he basted the meat. Next time I'll make a batch and half of the sauce, it really was great tasting, but we really had to stretch it. We served over white rice with broccoli, all a great combination. Just a note, if you have a green egg cooker, there is a YouTube video on how you can cook this like the Cantonese do by hanging it in your grill.

I like this recipe and have made it three times, with modifications the second and third time. Some observations: Chinese use pork butt for Char Siu because we love the fat and it really is part and parcel to the authentic dish. That said, I used tenderloin the first time, pork sirloin roast the second, and pork shoulder the last. The latter/fatter cut was better in flavor and juiciness, but of course, less healthy.

I do like pretty red colored char siu but against my better judgement, I used the full 2 tablespoons of food color which was huge overkill.  I went with 1 tablespoon the second time and it was still way too much and stained my cutting board. Food coloring is terrible for our bodies so cut it way back, or not at all, or as suggested, substitute red bean paste or boil down some beets if you want it red. 

I also like five spice, but take care how much you use. It will overpower all other ingredients. I suggest 1/2 teaspoon or less.
Reserve 1/2 cup of the marinade for non-cross contaminated basting before you bag up the meat, and marinate it no less than overnight. It needs to be in the soup that long to penetrate. Don't cook it for an hour or you'll overcook. Use a thermometer and pull it at 145 degrees and let it rest. The water pan is a good suggestion if you are using leaner cuts. A whole butt roast makes a lot, so I portion it up and freeze pieces for later use. I just made 
Char Siu, doufu, fan (BBQ pork tofu over rice) using bean paste as the main seasoning f

My grill is under a snow bank, so I made this as close as I could on a pan on the stove.   I did cook with some of the extra marinade, so I probably got a little extra flavor from that.   Very nice.   I will probably make again.

Delicious!  And prepared in the oven...  

I used a pork shoulder roast (which was on sale), trimmed of fat and cut into 2"x5" pieces.  I also substituted cooking sherry for the rice wine, and I didn't use food coloring.  Cooked it in the oven at 350° on a wire rack set above a pan with about 1/2" of water in it for about 45 minutes.  Half-way through the cooking process, I brushed the meat with the marinade and then finished in the oven.  Tastes just like my favorite restaurant but much less expensive!

I'm a new cook learning from my mom. This is my 2nd time making this recipe and it's great. I used rice wine vinegar and baked it in the oven at 350 for 45 mins over a baking dish filled with water, brush them 1/2 way thru process with marinade. At the end put them in the boiler for about 2-4 mins to crisp the skin,  used tenderloin and served with white rice. Very good and close to Sam Woo BBQ a local and classic Chinese restaurant

I loved everything about this marinade, yum!  Only addition, a slug of rice wine vinegar, with all of the sweet going on, felt it needed a little acid balance.  Hubs grilled to perfection.  A keeper!  Thanks for the recipe, D & A.

This marinade tastes really good! those of you that used gin or sherry, the only thing I have to say is yuck! Next time get all the ingredients correctly if you really want to have good tasting meat. Something's you just don't substitute.

Not sure what went wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted cooking sherry for rice wine do to no availability and cooked in the oven as it's winter in Ak and grilling was not an option.  I marinated two pork tenderloins and cooked the first one after two hours in the marinade.  It wasn't very good and the flavor tasted way off.  So I let the second tenderloin marinate over night thinking maybe that would help.  It was even worse.  I usually like homemade asian recipes and I love bbq pork so not sure where this recipe went wrong as others seemed to really like it.  We will not make again.

this recipe was better than any restaurant, or store bought barbecue pork I have ever eaten. It remained moist tender and very flavorful. I left the tenderloin whole and slow cooked it on the grill. Will definitely be using this recipe again. Thank you for sharing.

We have made this a number of times. We always cooked it in the oven rather than the grill. When we forget to put it in to marinate early enough, we have cooked in the oven, in the marinade. Then we remove it and broil it to give it a glaze. Thanks for the great recipe.

Confusing instructions.  This said to cut the loin into 1.1/2-2" long STRIPS.  Given the shape of a tenderloin, I took that to mean SLICES and this made the pork VERY dried out after cooking...even though I didn't cook for half as long as recommended and basted regularly.   A similar recipe read “cut pork roast in half lengthwise and each half again lengthwise forming 4 long thick pieces of pork.”  That makes more sense! 2 halves might even be enough.

I made this as the directions and ingredients suggest except I couldn't put on the grill.  I pan fried each piece then placed in a 350 oven for 30mins and then under the broiler for 5 minutes .. my husband loved it and I have to admit it gave Paul's Kitchen , in Los Angeles, a run for the money.

Perfect! I grew up eating this in Southern California as all the Chinese places have BBQ Pork as a combo plate or alone et cetera. But I couldn't find it anywhere when I moved to the East Coast or Central US. So I decided to find a recipe and try making it myself. 

It came out perfect, thank you for posting this recipe.

This was so yummy. I marinated over night. I used pork loin chops that I cut into strips. I cooked it on the skillet one way it was nice and crispy. I put it in the oven with a casserole dish and wire rack at 350 for 15 min which was also good but I prefer the crisp. I will definitely be making this again!

Tasted just like it was from a Chinese bbq restaurant.  I skipped the red food colouring.  I couldn't find rice wine so I used gin based on a tip I saw online.

I didn't change a thing.    It came out awesome.

One suggestion would be to provide some guidance on how much 2 pork loins weigh.

I love this recipe just as written without the optional five-spice.  I sliced it up, stirred it with some vegetables, put it over fettuccine with soy sauce, and called it stir-fry.  It made me happy.

Tasted pretty close to my favorite chinese resturant  style bbq pork, and its pretty easy! I used teriyaki sauce only because  I didnt have any soy, and I added a little extra honey to make the marinade thicker and marinaded overnight.  I dont have a grill  so I roasted it in the oven, for the last 15 minutes I cranked up the heat to make it a little crisp. The hubby even liked it, so ill be making it again!

Super easy to make. Uses simple and staple ingredients. Left out the Chinese five spice but it turned out well. Trick was to marinate the pork overnight in the fridge. Then roasted it in the oven in a baking dish along with the remainder of the marinate.  Thanks for this recipe!

I liked the recipe but I did make some changes. I added a bit more five spice, ketchup was not really adding any flavor, added a teaspoon of lemon, a half teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of minced garlic. Otherwise it was good :)

I was suspicious of the cook time, based on a barbecue grill. Sure enough, I ended up with charcoal - a whole tenderloin wasted. The notes at the top say "indirect heat," but a typical gas grill isn't really indirect, and it is quite hot on its lowest setting.

This was delicious! I cooked half of a pork loin roast so I cut this recipe in half. Next time I’ll cut the pork loin in 4ths the long way. Pieces we’ve had in restaurants always seemed smaller diameter than ours. I marinated the pork in a gallon bag for about 28 hours. I followed it exactly except for two changes: 1st I left out the red food coloring. 2nd, I did not have any Rice Wine so I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar per a substitution link online. My husband was thrilled with the flavor. I don’t recall tasting the 5 spice in restaurant BBQ pork but we really enjoyed this.

I used store bought Lee Kum Kee brand Chinese BBQ sauce called Char Sui sauce which made it super easy.  Smeared the sauce on a couple of nice tenderloins and grilled it on the gas grill USING A GRILL MAT (which rock by the way) which cooked it evenly and nothing stuck to the mat.  The grill mats are great at keeping your grill clean and preventing food from burning but still has all the flavor of grilled food and grill marks too!  I was only using  the mats for fish, but discovered they are great for ALL grilling and no flare ups or burnt spots!  Tasted great, very authentic and the store bought sauce made it stupid simple to make and Mom and I chowed down and we took the leftovers on our car trip for lunch so we wouldn't have  to stop.

Didn't understand the cutting instructions. Used a boneless pork loin cut into three strips.reduced five spice to 1 1/2 tsps. Tastes just like what I buy at a Chinese restaurant. Could only find Chinese rice cooking wine but it worked. Great recipe, will make it again.

I added a teaspoon of sesame oil, and a clove of garlic (grated) to the marinade. I also  sliced the tenderloin in half, length ways, and marinated them whole.

Followed the recipe to the letter and this is awesome.  Don't change a thing, except you might want to double it, as four of us (2 adults and 2 17 y/o girls) ate it all, no leftovers!

I made this using a pork butt I had previously smoked.
Using this sauce recipe I made it more like burnt ends.
The only thing I omitted was the 5 spice as I don't care for it either. ( It has too much clove for my taste)

I will certainly do this again!

This was SO delicious! The only differences made were not pre-cutting the tenderloins (cooked them whole), cooked in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes on a rack over a sheet pan with a bit of water, then broiled for a few minutes to crisp and then sliced . . . Tasted just as good as restaurant bbq pork and will definitely make again!

This Char Siu recipe works BEAUTIFULLY with the "Baked Fried Rice" recipe found on this site.  Simply take 6 to 10 half-inch to one-inch slices of boneless pork chops, use a Jaccard  ( you passionate at-home chefs know what I mean here ) or meat tenderizer mallet on each slice before placing in the marinating bag.  Following step 2: TRIPLE the sauce for marinating ( OVER-NIGHT ) and saving the reserve ( in a separate container )  for basting, dipping AND pouring a generous amount on the last step of the mentioned "Baked Fried Rice" recipe.  Defintely will make this again!!

love it on the grill.  However, I've been kind of lazy lately and broiled it in my toaster oven.  I followed the marinade, placed the pork in a ziplock, marinated for at least 3 days on accident, made it extra tasty.  The only substitute was really teriyaki instead of soy, makes it more sweet, less salty.  I also don't like ketchup, used some Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce instead and then reduced the brown sugar.   I don't usually measure everything, just kind of eyeball it, but am usually pretty close.  Between broiling  in the toaster oven and the gas grill, can't really tell much of a difference.  15 minutes on broil makes it pretty glazed in the toaster, no need to flip, but you clean up and cook time is a little easier.  If I'm making a lot for many, I bust out the charcoal grill and it really steps it up a notch.

The 5 Spice powder was too overpowering for us and the ketchup was an odd taste. Pretty good.

I started with a Smithfield teriyaki pork loin. Instead of hoisin sauce and Chinese spice I sprinkled in turmeric, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cinnamon, ginger and cloves to taste. Turned out so delicious.  I will make this again.

I’m not sure my recipe counts as actual Chinese BBQ but it was delicious. 

Cutting it in pieces instead of cooking the pork loin uncut was so much tastier because each piece was juicy and charbroiled. 

I didn’t use indirect heat or a water pan and I think it was done in 29 minutes nor less.

Make this often using a whole pork tenderloin and then grilling.  Use more 5 spice powder and leave out the Red food coloring.  Leftovers are wonderful in Pork Fried Rice.

I have been looking for this BBQ for several years and finally discovered what it was called. I could not find 5 spice and looked up the ingredients and made my own 5 spice. Cook this meal exactly the way it is described. It’s great and taste just like it’s supposed to.

No changes other than leaving out the red food coloring. Mine ended up looking like it had a hint of red anyways. I cooked it in the oven at 375° and then broiled it for 2-3 minutes.

This was a fantastic recipe. I did omit the red food colouring, but it was exactly the taste I was looking for and tasted just like our fave Asian restaurants' BBQ pork.
We cooked ours on a smoker and we couldn't stop snacking on it. lol

I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect, it taste just like my Chinese Restaraunt. I used my copper crisper basket over a pot of water in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes, and it came out beautiful with a char and all. I’ve made it two  twice already.  I love love love this recipe, THANK YOU!

WARNING: This recipe is not for everyone. If you love char siu pork, I believe you'll love this recipe. However, the hoisin sauce and the Chinese Five Spice used in this (and most char siu recipes) have unique and distinctive flavors that some people will dislike immensely. 
I made this per the recipe with three exceptions. I had no Chinese wine so substituted garlic red wine vinegar that I had on hand, I omitted the traditional red food coloring, and I marinated the pork for 18 hours to maximize the flavor. It turned out fantastic, the wonderful char siu flavor I was yearning for. I couldn't resist eating a few pieces hot off the grill but the remainder is destined to be an ingredient in my fried rice. After cooling, I vacuum sealed the meat into 4 portions for freezing and future use. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is not char siu. I made the measurements in this recipe to work with half a pork tenderloin just to try it out. I cut out the red food colouring, only used 1.5 tbsp of honey, and added 1 clove of minced garlic and the taste was still way off. It was too sweet and the marinade didn't soak into the surface of the meat like it was supposed to.

I've never used ketchup in Chinese cooking for a good reason, and this "char siu" just proved to me why you should never use ketchup in traditional Chinese food. The marinade became too runny when I brushed it onto the meat near the end. I'm never making this recipe again.

Not too bad but we will definately cut down on the 5 spice powder by at least 1/2 the next time.  It was just too strong.  We cooked it low and slow on our Treager wood pellet grill with a pan of water in the grill as well, basting it every 5-7 minutes with the marinade which kept it very moist.

Great recipe! Taste was awesome.  I followed the cooking time but would take the meat off the grill sooner.  It was a bit dry but that is also due to using a pork loin.  I might try using a different cut of port next time.

This was so good!  The only "change" I made was how I cut the meat. I cut it so it could easily be skewered on soaked wooden skewers, then cooked @ 350* over a baking dish with 1 inch of water for 25 min.  Oh, and I left out the food coloring, no need for it.

This was ok, not quite what I was looking for.  I added garlic and onion powder, but should have added some fresh ginger since that may have been what was lacking.  My family did like it for something different.

This one was just ok for me.  I will say up front, I'm an apartment dweller who can't have a grill, so I made mine in the oven.  The port did turn out well, but the sauce wasn't spectacular.  The food coloring made it look more authentic, but it didn't add anything beyond turning the meat a bright red and staining my hands when the bag I was marinating in slipped.

The taste was fine, but not out of this world.  I probably won't make again, there are other recipes I enjoyed more.

I would skip the ketchup as it imparts a slight acidic taste, which to me isn't true to the taste of what char siu should be.
I would definitely add in the 5 spice powder though.

Made the marinade exactly as written except I used slightly less than 1tbsp food coloring, since that's all I had. I didn't cook them on the grill as suggested. Instead I cooked them on the stove top. My pork was thinly slice and it took far less than an hour to cook. The flavor was very good. Due to time constraints I only marinated them for an hour and I wish I would have let them marinate much longer.

This was really good but I feel like I've had a different recipe in the past that was better. Can't remember what was different about it though. I do know that with this one you need to thicken that sauce with a cornstarch slurry or it isn't going to stick if you do this on the grill. Thanks for sharing!

This was nice and juicy! I did both baking it and grilling it. Both were perfect! My husband thinks its a bit plain but I think its just perfect the way it is. I ran out of red food coloring and doubled the recipe and it still came out great.

This was excellent.  Added garlic.   All the Engels ate it.  I sliced up a roast but that was a lot of work plus lots of waste  so maybe try tenderloin next time.  Had 2 outside burners high on the bbq and cooked on the middled two with no heat.  Kept basting with the sauce (need to make a double batch for this tribe so we had some extra sauce with the rice).  Took about 45 minutes. Put pot of water on upper rack.    Made 4 cups of rice (uncooked) and was lots.  Marinated overnight.

I used this sauce on pork baby back ribs.  It was really good, but I only used half the suggested amount of Chinese Five Spice and that was plenty.  I will definitely this again with a pork butt or shoulder.

Very good!  I added some pureed garlic and red pepper flakes.  In the future, I think I will add some sriracha to give it a bit of heat.  I didn't bother with the food coloring.

I made this recipe - substituting the rice wine with gin - and it was amazing. This recipe is a keeper. Just follow the instructions and you will have a Great Dinner. Thank you for sharing!
