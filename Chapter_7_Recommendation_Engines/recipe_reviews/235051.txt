Good Marinade but be careful, it's very acidic. 20 minutes is good for this one! I always add a lot of garlic and herbs as they add so much for me. I used white wine vinegar and found this will not change the marinade time. I marinated chicken breasts and pork tenderloin. Both came out great on the grill but add a sauce because the vinegar sticks around.

This was good for a fat free marinade.  When used with chicken and pork chops the meat was a little dry.  It might be better used with chicken on the bone with skin to add flavor without adding fat to an already fatty dish.

This was ok.  I think it needed something, maybe a Tbs. of raw honey would have done the trick.  I used this on veggie kabobs and only marinated about 1 hour.
