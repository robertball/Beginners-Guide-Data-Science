I adapted this to make in my Instant PotÂ®. I put the beans in the pot and covered with water. I let them soak for about an hour, and then put on the lid, closed the vent, did manual 15 minutes, NPR (natural pressure release). While the beans were cooking, I sauteed the onions, carrots and garlic (and I added some of the inner, leafy ribs of celery that I had on hand). When the pressure released on the IP, I opened the lid and added the veggies, chicken stock and bay leaf. I closed the lid and cooked on manual for an additional 10 minutes.  I added the spinach and parsley to the hot soup, and stirred until the spinach was wilted. Worked great! Really tasty soup on a cold day. Thanks for the recipe!

It was a very good soup. However, I used a powder chicken bullion and added the amount of salt called for in the recipe. Ot was way too salty. I added chicken breast and rice to absorb some of the salt and it turned out perfect.

Delicious. I'll be making this regularly. I was looking for a soup that's high in pottasium and delicious, that doesn't have tomato. I forgot the parsley at the end, and I hate olive oil so I used Avacado oil, and vegetable stock instead of chicken. I also didn't buy enough spinach, used 5oz instead of 8. I love the spinach in it, and the fact it has some protein. I just might puree all of it so I can drink it in my car   where I work out of. Thanks!
