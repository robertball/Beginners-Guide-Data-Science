I have made this a few times now. Here is what I did with it lately that makes it a great, easy dinner.  1. Make 1.5x more of the wet dressing. 2. Chop up some big chunks of: red bell pepper, sweet onion, mushrooms, two zuchinnis. Toss to coat with a few TBSPS of the wet dressing.  3. Pound the chicken breasts and roll them. Secure with toothpicks and drape with bacon. Roll them around in the wet dressing to coat.  4. Line a biggish pan with foil. Arrange the chicken breasts and pour all the veggies in between.  5. Let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours.  6. Make a foil tent.  7. Bake covered @ 375 for the first 25 minutes, uncover for the last 20 minutes (or until chicken is done and veggies are fork tender). About 45-50 minutes.   This is yummy. You could probably roll up some nice goat cheese in the chicken if you are cheesy. But it is a pretty good dish. I always add a little extra garlic and a little extra worcestershire and a coupla pinches of sugar to the dressing because I like to tweak things.

Quick and easy.  Flavor was ok, but not great.  I followed the recipe exactly and it would have gotten one more star if it had called for boneless, skinless breasts.

Our chicken turned out wonderfully moist, but I just couldn't taste the flavorings.  I even pierced the skin of the chicken and brushed some glaze over the chicken before putting the bacon on, then brushed it some more and let marinate in the refrigerator for  several hours.  Perhaps doubling the glaze would help?  That said, everyone still loved it.

Cooking these in a pan leaves everything submerged in a very large amount of bacon grease...and I used center cut which has less fat.  This was good enough that I might make it again (wrapping the bacon around chicken tenders and placing in a skillet in a skillet) but bacon tends to make everything taste good...I'm not really sure if I could taste the spices.

UPDATE:  I made it again.  This time I upped the mustart to 2 tablespoons and added dry parsley and 1 teaspoon liquid smoke (hickory) to the glaze.  Then I baked it on a rack to allow the fat to drain.  Much better; yet the recipe as is still is only a 2 star at best.

Great tangy recipe.  I substituted the Worshteshire for regular soy sauce, but it still came out great.

I and my family really enjoyed this recipe.  It was good.  Probably the next time I make it I will marinate the chicken breast in some of the sauce the night before I cook it.  I'd like for more of the flavor and seasoning to penetrate the meat.  Also I will use chicken worchestershire next time.  It is lighter in color and more mild in flavor.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I like all the ingredients that went into it.  It was just bland to me and lacked flavor for my taste buds.  I would not make it again, my fiance said he would eat it again, but it did lack flavor.  I am going to try it again but jazz it up saucier.  I like the mustard and tumeric idea so we will see what happens.

This is a very nice, simple recipe. I put the glaze and and refriherated the chicken for a few hours before baking it to help the seasoning settle in. The chicken came out very tender. I served it with peas and garlic mashed potatoes and everyone enjoyed a great Sunday dinner.

Awesome! I made this dish for my sister and brother-in-law. He doesn't like chicken in fact he hates almost everything except spaghetti. He would eat spaghetti 7 days a week if my sister would let him. Anyway, he was leery, but tried a bite. I am so glad I made double the recipe because he ate 4 serving himself.

Not bad.  I made this in the crockpot and am a bit irritated bf put it on earlier as I didn't want the chicken to be over cooked.  But regardless that the chicken was a bit dry, it was good.  I doubled all of the sauce ingredients except the oil and added a can of chicken broth since I was putting it in the crockpot.  I also put in already cooked bacon.  Thanks for the recipe!  Bf liked it too.

Odd as it sounds, because 'everything is always better with bacon', this really isn't.  I've done it with bacon, and another time leaving the skin on, and the second had much better flavor and moisture.  Something in this mix just doesn't meld well with the flavor of the bacon (when you can taste the bacon at all, usually you can't).

I pan-seared the skin for about 5 minutes, then cooked this at 400 for 20 minutes (an hour at 350 is much too long, and I'm using rather large breasts).  Because I bake this in an oven-safe pan rather than a baking dish, it's quick work to make a very nice pan sauce with what's left over.

Other than the bacon and cook time, very tasty!

I loved this and my husband said “delightful change from our regular [baked] chicken”.  Recipe did not say to eat with or discard bacon.  I served it with the chicken.  Delicious.  Not really strong spice flavor but am sure it would have tasted different without them.  Love the yellow color from the Tumeric!

I substituted curry powder for the turmeric since I didn't have any  I also added some paprika to give it a little bit of smokiness along with the bacon. I also added some mushrooms and onions. The only thing I regret is putting the bacon between the halves of chicken. The bacon ended up soggy, undercooked and not crispy like I like it. But besides that it was amazing.
