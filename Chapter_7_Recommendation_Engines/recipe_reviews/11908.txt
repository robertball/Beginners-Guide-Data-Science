I sauted minced garlic, chopped onion, and chopped chicken breast in a pan. I boiled frozen veggies separately. I made sauce as stated and then added chicken, pasta, and veggies at the last minute. I put in a little more soup and milk than called for and it turned out great. I highly recommend this dish.

This recipe is good but it's not one I would serve with company.  When cooking the soup with the carrots and broccoli, it took too long and I wonder if that is why the sauce was too thick.  Once mixed with the pasta, it just didn't seem like there was enough or that something needed to be added (like double the sauce?).  I will still try again, and despite these minor flaws, it was good.

This is my boyfriend's new fav recipe~!!  Modifications:  I used fresh cut up boneless/skinless chicken breast instead of cans of chicken chunks.  I also added to the recipe the following: more milk (maybe 1 1/2 cups total), 1/2 cup condensed evaporated milk, 1/4 tsp. red pepper, a dash of hot salt, 1/2 diced onion and a big tbs of chopped garlic.  I followed the directions of the recipe except for #3.  Instead, I poured this sauce over the cut up fresh chicken breast I had in a pan and baked in oven approx. 45 min. or until chicken was done.  I kept the pasta separate until serving, when I then put some warm pasta on each dinner plate before pouring sauce and chicken over the pasta.  You won't believe how good it is!

After seeing the reviews, I simply added a bigger can of soup, fresh cooked chicken and some snow pea pods, cooked it a little longer. I will make this again...and again!

I didn't add the veggies because my fiance isn't a veggie kinda guy and I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  I also added more pepper because one of the bowties is tomato-based and he hates all things tomato-based.  Pepper and some italian seasoning took the tomato taste away.

We didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, but changed some things and it was still pretty good. Not something I'd write home about, and probably not something I'd serve to guests, but it was more than sufficient for an easy, tasty, fast meal. 

We cubed 1 large chicken breast (for 2 people), and seasoned it heavily with various spices such as garlic pepper, garlic salt, rotisserie chicken seasoning, onion powder, and 2 taps of cumin. 

After the chicken was finished sautéing, we poured the soup mixture into the pan with the chicken, and added (actually accidentally) a ½ cup of Parmesan cheese. We also put a tablespoon of sour cream into the soup to give it more of a tang, and then peppered it with ground peppercorns. We then laid this mixture and pasta on top of fresh bits of spinach. 

It is VERY salty, so I'd recommend lower sodium condensed soup, or not to salt any of the food during cooking.

Great recipe for the family. My wife and kids are not broccoli fans at all, my self included, but in super tiny pieces, it went well. Made mushrooms on the side for myself (wife and kids are not mushroom fans either, "tough bunch to cook for") and it was a HUGE hit for me. We'll have it again for sure.

This was a really nice twist on pasta sauce. It was very mushroomy, but really heavy. If you're watching your weight, this isn't for you. However, if you love mushrooms, gobble it up!

I made this recipe as is, except for using fresh chicken instead of canned - which I would think would only enhance the flavor.  It was bland to the point of being inedible, which surprised me since I like all of the ingredients.  I couldn't decide what spices to add to make it better, so I covered it in shredded cheddar cheese and stuck the lid back.  That made it so we could at least eat it.  This felt like it should have been a good "comfort food" kind of recipe, but we really did not care for it.

Delicious.  I substituted diced chicken breast cooked with diced onion and added the vegetables to the pasta to cook instead of cooking them in the sauce.  I will definately make this again.

Pretty good. I sauteed the chicken with minced garlic & onion, and added mrs. dash orighinal, a little garlic powder, and some onion salt. Delish.

Nice base recipe. I added onions and fresh mushrooms. I also added more garlic and parsley; so I term this a base recipe because its easy to add stuff to it. Not a gourmet recipe but a great use for leftovers!

Okay I altered this recipe a lot after reading the reviews on this recipe.  I already had chicken breasts marinating in the refrigerator in italian dressing.  I cut them into cubes and cooked them in a pan.  Took them out and in the same pan, I cooked a bag of frozen vegetables, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup til tender.  I then added cooked bowtie noodles and the chicken in the mixture and stir till all of it is combined.  Topped it off with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Really good.

I made this for my kids and myself tonight and we love it! My son has dietary restrictions so we made a few substitutions: 100% whole wheat bowtie pasta, soy milk, veggie parmesean cheese, and we used Tyson's Fitwise Roasted, Diced Chicken. It was excellent! The roasted chicken made the meal.

We are definitely going to be having this again!

This was eatable, but that's about it.  After reading the reviews and taking some suggestions, such as using sauteed onion and garlic and adding some spice, I still ended up with a pretty BLAND dish.  Not sure what would have helped this one out.

Kids really loved this one.  Easy to make.  I steamed the broccoli 5-8 minutes and added to sauce when almost done.  Next time I will add 1/2 c water to sauce to thin.

Tasty and easy. Some of my family added extra farfalle to their plate. I used a little more chicken than called for and thought maybe there could be even more.

The cream sauce is FANTASTIC! This is such an easy sauce to make for any pasta dish. I am def adding to my cookbook.
I did not use the canned chicken, we had grilled garlic pepper chicken that we had frozen from a couple weeks ago that I thawed and cubed instead. I also used green beans instead of broc because...we didn't have broc. i also used a scoop of the jared garlic instead of garlic powder.

This was the 1st time I made this and used everything low sodium and steamed the vegetables.  As well I cooked the chicken that had no preservatives in the sprayed can of 0 anything in it.  It was outstandingly awesome and even my son who didn't care for broccoli loved it.

Incorporating numerous suggestions - I changed the recipe up. 1) Doubled the sauce  2) I used crofchicken soup (only because I didn't have crofmushroom on hand)  3) I used more than two times the grated parmesan cheese - 2 cups. I also added some leftover brie and some slivers of gouda (left overs from New Year's Eve)  4) added italian seasonings and a sprinkle of red pepper  5) splash of white wine  6) left out the carrots as I didn't have any on hand and  7) used penne pasta instead of farfelle.  Kept the canned chicken only because we were in a rush after getting home from work. Next time will follow the advice of sauteing chicken with garlic.  Good base recipe and Husband rates this as a definite do-over.

Used this recipe as a base, changes I made: no cheese or milk! fresh chicken breast pieces stir-fried with fresh garlic, and fresh mushrooms sauteed with butter and a splash of chicken broth. Mixed them all together in one skillet, put in the CofM soup, added the broccoli, let it sit covered on very low heat. No carrots, but added the pasta at the last, with fresh tarragon and put it in the fridge for hubbys lunchies for the week. We usually do not eat processed food, but my husband is a fan of midwest-cassarole in the winter, and this was easy to make & take, plus he said it was delicious! So even tho I changed it up hugely, I did get the idea from this base recipe, and am gonna give it 5 stars.

Definitely a good recipe for a quick meal.  However, since I had the time, I added basil, white wine and red bell peppers.  Additionally, I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of canned chicken.  After reading some of the reviews I also doubled the sauce.  Overall, turned out to be a great dinner and worth keeping in my recipe box.

I took the advice of other posters and doubled the sauce.  I thought it was pretty good for a quick on-the-run family meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy, tasty recipe with a great deal of tweaking. I used boiled, chunked chicken instead of canned, I substituted 3 cloves of grated carlic and 2 tbs. of margarine for the garlic salt, and I needed to add more milk, as the sauce wasn't quite enough to cover it. I also used ample amounts of parmesean. I really liked it, I loved the way that little pieces of broccoli became part of the sauce. My boyfriend thought that it coudd use more flavor and spices, but after he doctored it up, he really liked it.

awesome recipe, altogether took about 30 minutes (honest!).  Awesome quick dinner for any day of the week.  However, I made minor alterations...I used one canned chicken instead of two...I ommitted the carrots because I didn't have any but added corn instead...I also used cream of chicken soup because I am not a fan of mushrooms...and I also added just about every spice I had in my cabinet (in moderation, less is more) not just the pepper and garlic powder.  Overall I will make this recipe often as you can tweek it to your liking.  Highly recommended...thanks Cyndie

Very easy and good. I don't think I'd change a thing. Definetly a meal that takes less than 30 minutes to make. I used left over chicken. If you don't like your veggies more tender simmer sauce about 5 minutes more. I imagen thawed frozen broccoli would work if you didn't have fresh.

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm! I probably won't add the chicken next time, instead grill a chicken breast and  slice it to put on top, but the rest of this dish was fantastic. I enjoyed this quite a bit.

Made this with 2 cups of pasta and it needed more sauce. I doubled the sauce, but that was too much. Maybe try with two cans mushroom soup but not as much milk?

This was an okay dish.  It came out fine except it was pretty bland and didn't have much to it.  
Also I would suggest substituting the cream of mushroom soup for another flavor, perhaps cream of broccoli or cream of chicken because you really can't taste the mushroom at all.
Probably won't make this again.

I used Campbell's classic Cream of Mushroom soup, and the flavor of this dish turned out to be so-so.  It was pretty bland.  However, when I reheated it for a second meal, I added olive oil, salt, pepper, and bacon bits, and it tasted a lot better.

1 problem, not enough liquid to soften the carrots and broccoli. I had to add liquid and ended up with some stuck to the bottom of the pot. I made a double batch and froze 1/2 for later this week. It was very good, the kids loved it.

I liked this dish.  I made it for company and everyone raved, but worried (consistently) about their waistlines.  Swimming in the pool afterwards eliminated this fear.  I substituted green beans for broccoli and everyone loved it.  Thanks,Cyndie!

My family raved over this dish. It is very easy and quick to make. I fried 2 cut-up  chicken breast with 1/2 can of mushrooms in a small amount of oil. I also used multi-colored spiral noodles. Serving cresant rolls and a tossed salad along side makes a nice addition.

Very easy and very tasty.  I substituted mushrooms for carrots.  Sauteed the mushrooms  with some garlic infused olive oil and a garlic paste.  I also cheated with frozen broccoli which I did not thaw out completely.  Mixed the sauce with the shrooms, then added the pasta, broccoli, and chicken and let simmer for about 10-15 minutes.

Good foundation recipe that can be easily adjusted based on what you have available.  I doubled to 2 cans of soup; 1 1/2 cups of milk & 1/2 cup of Italian 4 cheese blend.  I brought those ingredients to a boil then added 2 cups each of broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, and diagonally sliced carrots.  All veggies were fresh & cut to bite size.  I had a roasted chicken so added 2 cups of diced breast meat.   I turned the heat down to low for 8 minutes.  

Family gave it the thumbs up.  I'll be making it again.  It's a tasty, easy, middle of the week recipe.

I sauted onions, carrots, & peppers with garlic for several minutes.  Added broccoli & 2 pre-cooked chicken breasts which were  cut into small pieces for several minutes.  I mixed mushroom soup, milk with parmesan cheese and whisked until smooth.  Add to the vegetable & meat  mixture and heat.  Bring to a low boil and simmer until every is heated evenly.  Add cooked  pasta.  Let this simmer for a few minutes. Fast & easy to prepare.  Also very delicious.

I loved this recipe! Added two cloves of minced garlic, one cup milk, extra cheese, and baked it in the oven on 350 for 10 min, with an extra 5 min uncovered. 
Would be better to have real shredded chicken rather than canned chicken.

it tasted great in the pot. but i found it bland on the noodles. my adult kids loved it. they said it wasn't over powering, but still flavorful. so i'm going to try making this again but putting more garlic and some fresh garlic. maybe more cheese too.

I saw this recipe upon going to to the grocery store and picked up the soup I needed to make it. I tweaked the recipe and it turned out DELISH. I cooked 1 PC fresh chix breast untile about done and added the cream of mushroom soup and if added two cups of milk instead of 3/4 salt and pepper, garlic powder. I separately boiled fresh broccoli and carrots in the same pot mean while cooking the bow tie pasta. When pasta was finished I drained and added the soup chicken mixture when that began to boil and rise, additionally I added the veggies when complete. I then in a new pan put in a little Olive oil chopped up four large mushrooms and through them in, I also added about 1/4 cup of milk to make them flavorful and when they became Soft through them in the pot! (Also added cellary to soup mixture)--- great simple and fast dish!!!

Great basic recipe!  Because I made some minor additions/changes, I only gave 4 stars instead of 5.  
I had cooked chicken breasts with 3 garlic cloves all day in my crockpot, not knowing what to use them for. I found this recipe and made a couple minor changes. 
I cooked the farfalle pasta with frozen broccoli as someone else suggested. Great idea.  I put 2 tbsp butter in the pot while the pasta drained, added the cream of mushroom soup and milk, paprika, ground black pepper and red pepper flakes. A can of mushrooms went in with the shredded chicken breast. Then I added the pasta/broccoli mix back in, and folded in approx 3/4 cup of sour cream.  I heated through, topped with the parmesan cheese and YUMMY dinner!
