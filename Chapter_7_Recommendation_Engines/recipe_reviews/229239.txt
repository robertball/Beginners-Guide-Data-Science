I really liked the seasonings in this.. quite tasty. A friend had some home grown mild peppers so I threw in one of those and I used egg beaters. I added a little salt and a lot of cracked rainbow peppercorns because I am a pepper freak. I'll make this again. Next time I'll add a bit more egg

This was very tasty.  I used 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites.  I also used only half of the cheese.  It was very good though it did take about 46 minutes to cook!  Very easy too.  I omitted the onion because there was onion in the pico de gallo.  I will be making this one again!  Thanks for sharing!

Easy to prepare. I used more eggs and let it cook about 15 minutes longer until it was not runny. Easy to change ingredients if you want different flavors depending on your needs.

I used Mexican cheese blend instead of Italian . It should be cooked an hour instead of 40 min. as potatoes do d not seem done enough.

OMG!  This was awesome!  Needed something to make for guests this morning, had all the ingredients & added fresh chopped basil and it was amazingly good!  Don't forget to serve with fresh fruit on the side.

I didn't love this. I thought the ratio of eggs to potatoes was off / too many potatoes. I'd prefer more eggs. The Greek seasoning was also a little much for my taste. If I made again, I'd probably reduce the seasoning and add some sausage to make more of a breakfast casserole out of it.
