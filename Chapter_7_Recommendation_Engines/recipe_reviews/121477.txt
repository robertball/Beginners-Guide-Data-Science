It was very moist, but not flavorful enough. I used mayo instead of yogurt (no plain yogurt on hand), and changed the proportion to 1 part dijon and 2 parts mayo....but it still wasn't enough dijon: should have made it  2-3 dijon, 1 mayo or yogurt.  Needed some salt too.  I think with these adjustments, it will be much better.

Omg, this is so Tasty!! My husband was totally thrilled. It tasted even better than fried chicken. I used breadcrumbs instead of corn flakes and it worked really well. Will definitely make it again! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

We really enjoyed this! I used blsl chicken and didn't have the  salt-free blend, so I just created my own. It did take a bit longer in our oven, but we also had pretty large chicken pieces. Overall, a yummy dinner! I served with sauteed green beans and leftover curried rice pilaf from this site. Thanks for sharing!

I substituted mayo for yogurt and bumped up the Dijon to 2 teaspoons. I also added garlic & onion powders. My husband (picky eater) loved this & asked me to make it again.

I didn't make it exactly as written. Used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes, made my own spice/herb mixture, used  non-fat yogurt and a mozza-cheddar-jack combo instead of parmesan since I didn't have any. Baked about an hour. It turned out tender, juicy and quite tasty.

Spectacular! I followed the recipe mostly but substituted pinapple juice for lemon and Russian salad dressing for yogert at the specified qualities. Served with yellow rice w/ green and red peppers. I highly recommend this recipe, although I may add more spice next time.
