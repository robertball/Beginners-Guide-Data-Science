Quite good. I used gluten free croutons that I home made.  I believe that the submitter intended to write to line a baking sheet with parchment paper, not wax paper. Thank you for the recipe.

I liked this recipe, but had to change it a bit. My daughter even ate it and she doesn't like eggplant anything. I didn't have croutons, so I used panko breadcrumbs instead. I had to bake the eggplant longer, about 20 mins per side at 375. I would recommend using 1 large pan to bake the eggplant in and then take it out and use that same pan to bake it in with the sauce and cheese. I would not season the egg wash, I had to use 2 eggs, but would season the breadcrumbs, I had to use 3-4 cups. I seasoned the breadcrumbs with garlic and onion powder, red pepper flakes, s + p, and lots of it. Eggplant is so mild. I only had to bake it for 15 mins with the sauce and cheese. You could put turkey pepperonis on top when done or bake them on top with the eggplant. Overall, a good meal.

Instead of baking, I fried the eggplant in olive oil; instead of using crotons, I used bread crumbs. This was very tasty and flavorful.
