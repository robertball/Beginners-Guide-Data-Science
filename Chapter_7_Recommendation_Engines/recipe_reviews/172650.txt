Not what I expected from a lace cookie. The batter was very stiff... and the cookies came out very thick. Crunchy, not thin and crispy. I tried to flatten them out as much as I could, to no avail. A little less flour might help? I wouldn't wait an entire minute before shaping, they harden fast.

These not only didn't turn out but they didn't taste good.  I followed the recipe exactly and they didn't spread and they stuck to the silpat I used.  I didn't know anything stuck to silpat??? I won't make these again.
