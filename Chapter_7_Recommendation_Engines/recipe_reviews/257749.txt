I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could!  It was simple to prepare, and tasted like a luxury comfort food.  Tasted great for lunch the next day too!
Only thing I will do differently next time is mix the alfredo sauce in with the noodles as well as the shrimp and broccoli, rather than just pouring it over.

I will definitely make again. Changed the recipe a little by adding mushrooms, red peppers and seasoned the chicken before mixing in shrimp and other ingredients.  Family loved it.  Served with toss salad and crescent rolls.

Very hearty and satisfying.   I threw Panko bread crumbs on top.

I made this then regretted it due to the pasta. I gave some to my extended family to help eat for the week. But It was tasty. Shrimp broccoli and the noodles at the bottom. Perfect combo. Good as leftovers. Probably need to find a healthy substitute for the pasta If on a diet like me

Very easy to make and very delicious! The family loved it! Next time I think I'll try different pasta instead of the Angel Hair pasta. I also mixed in some tomatoes. Very good!

Turned out awesome! I used semi cooked spaghetti squash instead of pasta. And added sautéed mushrooms along with broccoli. Absolutely delicious.

We loved this recipe! I accidentally had a bit too much wine and forgot to put the leftovers in the fridge.  My husband was like “ well just make some more” lol.  So I did!  Yummy
