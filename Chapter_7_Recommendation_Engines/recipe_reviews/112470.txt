Good but not great.  Easy to throw together .  Be generous with the Pepper, Salt, and Paprika as it could use more flavor and perhaps a touch less water.

I make something similar to this often. My husband hunts pheasant. They are getting scarce now so I used Rock Cornish Game Hens this time. I left them whole, as I don't like the meat masserated from cooking so long. We like more texture. I cooked 4 hours & the meat was falling off the bone & the carrots were tender crisp & not mushy. I also sprinkled the tops of hens with Montreal chicken seasoning. Add so much more flavor. I really liked this recipe overall.

This was very easy to make.  I am always leery about any recipe that requires cannned soup.  I followed the recipe except I added corn instead of pea.  Great was to use up the pheasant thighs.

We agree first review.  Less water and more a little more spice would have been better.

This was the recipe I used for the first pheasants my husband shot since we've between married. I used whole breasts and took a cue about the extra spices.  He absolutely loved it and I will be making it again.
