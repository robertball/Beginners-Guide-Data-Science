Really, really tasty! These had really great flavor and not at all spicy even though I almost tripled the wing sauce for more flavor (I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce). I used hoagie buns that I needed to use up and added a bit of prepared Ranch dressing to the sauce mixture, which added a nice tang. I slathered the sauce on both sides of the buns, then layered as directed. My pepperjack cheese had *mysteriously* disappeared (thank you Mr. CookinBug), so I used a mixture of shredded mozzarella and cheddar. Will definitely make these again and again. Thanks :)

Terrific recipe.  I agree with many reviewers that 1) you can increase the wing sauce and 2) in should be baked open face to melt the cheese and get the sandwich nice and hot inside.  You could add other favorites like grilled onions to add to the already awesome flavor.  My teenage and older girls lived the sandwich.  Thanks!

Made this as an appetizer. Used french bread rounds. Spread sauce (w/double hot sauce), shredded chicken, crumbled bacon, and shredded cheese. Baked open face just until cheese was melted. Wonderful!

After reviewing feedback from several other users, I decided to mix the sauce into the chicken rather than use it as a condiment.  I also warmed the sandwiches open-faced and placed the tops on afterwards.  The only recommendation I would make for warming it this way is to reserve some of the sauce to place on the tops of the bread (to help hold it in place better).  This sandwich is so, so good!  You've got to try it!

Very good! I have a strong aversion to mayo, so I replaced it with cream cheese. Also added onions and cooked open faced.

If this recipe called for twice the amount of the hot sauce I would have rated it 5 stars!  I did double the hot sauce, so it was outstanding.  I used french bread, it was all I had, but everything else stayed the same.  Thank you for a new favorite!

YUM!  Such a simple recipe and so delicious!   I shredded the meat from a couple leftover grilled breasts and used sub rolls.  I increased the hot sauce as well and spread the sauce on both sides of the roll.  It did get a little crunchy in the oven, but I thought that was good.   Thank you for the recipe!

THIS WAS OK- SOUNDED GREAT- HUSBAND SAID IT WAS BLAND- I PUT MORE SEASONING IN HIS MADE SANDWICH- ADDED MORE WING SAUCE, GARLIC POWDER, PEPPER- MY SANDWICH DIDN'T WORK WELL WRAPPED UP IN FOIL AND BAKED- BOTTOM WAS REAL CRISPY (DONE ON CENTER RACK)- WHICH WAS OK BUT THE CHEESE WAS NOT MELTED INSIDE SANDWICH- . I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF THE SAUCE WENT ON BOTH SIDES- YOU ADDED YOUR MEATS AND THEN YOUR CHEESE AND OPEN FACED BROILED IT - JUST A THOUGHT- THANKS FOR LETTING ME TRY YOUR RECIPE-

This was delicious!  I mixed the sauce with the chicken.  My husband and I both loved it.  If you like it really spicy just add some cayenne or hot sauce to the sauce mix.

I am giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt because what I made I would consider a three-star.  Nothing all that special, no wow factor for us.  However, the problem may have been that I did not have hot buffalo wing sauce, so I used Frank’s hot sauce.  That may have made a difference that I’m not aware of.  I used grilled chicken and shredded it as soon as it came off the grill.  I also did use the roasted red peppers, using about half a pepper per sandwich, which I would increase if I make it again.  If I find the need to buy hot wing sauce in the future, I may just have to give this one another try.  UPDATE: 8/23/13 - I made this again and still didn't have the hot buffalo wing sauce, so rather than using Frank's again I nixed the "buffalo" aspect of this altogether and just served this with cajun mayo on the side.  Very good!

This is the most amazing sandwich I have ever eaten! Absolutely delicious!! The only changes I made was to double the buffalo sauce (I used Red Hot), and I grilled the chicken seasoned with Morton's Nature's Seasonings. I didn't actually shred the chicken just pulled it apart with my fingers in small pieces. Do not omit the roasted peppers..they give it a wonderful flavor! I wrapped the sandwich up in aluminum foil and cooked on the grill over indirect heat at around 300 degrees for about 25 minutes. I posted a picture of the one I fixed. I can't wait to fix this again!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I absolutely LOVE this sandwich... though this isn't the healthiest choice, it is amazing for a night off of my normal diet!  I, like many others, like my buffalo chicken spicy so I tripled the amount of buffalo sauce.  I also tossed the chicken is some of the sauce and before putting the sandwich in the oven, I poured some sauce on top of the chicken.  I also added some grilled onions.  LOVED this...!

Fantastic sandwich!  Will make often!  I used the spread (extra hot sauce) on both sides of the bread and cut the baking time down to 15 minutes (on fresh bakery rolls).  Pefect!

This was a good sandwich.  If I make it again, I'd probably buy the pre-cooked chicken strips you can get at the supermarket to put in place of the rotisserie chicken.  The rotisserie chicken made the sandwich a little 'slippery', but it wasn't bad.

My husband loved this. I made without the hot sauce for the boys and slathered extra hot sauce for hubs and I. Very tasty and a different take on Sunday lunch. Great with a side of homemade baked potato salad.

This was average.  I used baked buffalo chicken tenders (no breading) and made the sauce.  We liked the bacon and cheese with the chicken.  It's an okay weekend lunch, but not so much a weeknight dinner meal.

These were excellent!  My husband actually commented the next morning again about how good they were.  I did change a couple things.  First I did not have any pepperjack cheese, so we just used mozzarella.  Secondly, since some reviews said it wasn't really that hot I mixed my chicken (just boiled) with a little bit of butter and hot sauce and let it soak for a while and then followed the recipe as stated.  They weren't too hot (or too hot sauce tasting) for my liking and perfect for my hot sauce loving husband!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic sammy that Rob and I both loved!  I didn't measure the hot sauce but just kept sprinkling it in until I could taste the heat. What an amazing sauce this made so I made sure to use it on both slices of bread. I also placed the red peppers in the sandwich right from the get go and it was fine. We'll definitely be having this one again Jen and thank you!

Not bad for a Saturday evening dinner and a movie meal. This was really easy to prepare and the sauce was excellent. I'll probably use the sauce for other things too. I didn't have any peppers but I would like to try it again with them on it. I'm sure it will be even better.

Fantastic sandwich - a real hubby pleaser! I only made 4 sandwiches so halved the amount of mayo and sour cream, but still put about 3T of hot sauce. I also added some sliced jalapenos between the bacon and cheese. I just used some hot dog buns, left them open-faced and heated them in the 350 oven for about 6 minutes. Yum!

My wife and I went backand forth on this recipe.  Could be a great recipe for parties / gatherings but wasn't a "dinner" recipe.

Very good,  but you really must increase the wing sauce!  I tripled the sauce when I made it.  I also sauteed some onion slices in the bacon grease & added that to the sandwich, & hoagie rolls.  I used leftover diced chicken breast, and I think this will be a new standby for us in using up our leftovers!!

Needs a lot more hot sauce! I was worried the bacon would over power the other ingredients but actually it was delicious! I have added this to my recipe box :)

I didn't have sour cream, so I used blue cheese dressing to equal the sour cream.  The sandwich was devoured by my family.

I changed a few things according to what I had on hand like: turkey - bacon bits - motz. cheddar and blue cheese & sliced bread. I put butter on both pieces of bread and grilled the sandwich on the stove top.  Next time I'll put a little extra sauce on both pieces of bread as I felt it was too dry with the amount I put on & try to have all the ingreds. on hand to make it according to the recipe - but we liked it the cheasy way I made it also - which left me the desire to make it correctly!! Thanks for a new quick meal idea!!

I thought it was amazinf and very filling. I had also made pasta but it was not neccesary. I mixed the chicken and the sauce and it came out good. I also put the roasted peppers in before and it tasted good. I also didn't use italian bread but hamburger buns and it made it easy for individual serving. My picky sister even ate it and liked it! I will make it again.

We all (6 of us) found the amount of hot sauce to be perfect.  I felt like the bacon and peppers kind of blended in to everything so I'm not sure what I'll do w/ that next time.  It's easy enough to put together and the flavor is great so I'm going to do this again BUT I felt like the bread texture took away from the filling.  Going to try this as a wrap next time, maybe grilled, with some tomatoes, maybe some lettuce, red onion.......

My family loved these.  I used sub rolls and Perdue roasted chicken short cuts.  I broiled open faced for less that 10 minutes, chicken with peppers on bottom side and bacon with shredded pepperjack cheese on top side.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so easy!!  I am glad I avoided the temptation to alter the recipe before trying it.  The only modification I would make  is to decrease the mayo, and the buffalo sauce a little bit.  Great simple recipe.

These were very good.  I was a little pressed for time, so I just baked them at 350, open-faced long enough to melt the cheese.  The "dressing" is very good.  I may make this as a dip in the future for chicken wings or chicken nuggets.

This was a great and super easy dinner for me and my husband!  We used light sour cream and equal parts mayo to sour cream - added hot sauce & cayenne pepper and then mixed w/the chicken.  This would be even better if you mixed it up the night before to let the kick get into the chicken!  Also added light cheddar cheese to try to reduce the fat!  Added lettuce & tomato and scrumtious!

We've made this several times and love it!  I do add an extra tablespoon of buffalo sauce and use cheddar on the kids half of the sandwich, we like the pepperjack on our half.  This has also become our go to recipe when camping.  Prepare it the night before and wrap it in two halves so it cooks more evenly.  A hassle free meal after setting up the campsite.  Thank you!!!

My boyfriend absolutely loved this sandwhich. I mixed the "buffalo mayo" with the chicken and used chedder cheese. Not over cooking the bacon is crucial. I threw it in the oven open faced just to toast and melt the cheese. I think I'm gonna serve it with cole slaw next time

Great recipe. This is a go to summer recipe for me as the summer months are very crazy and busy.It works great if not everyone can be there when it is right out of the oven, it can always stay warm in the oven or can be eaten at room temp. It is a huge hit and the boys love that they can put what they want on it after I have followed the recipe. Thank you for this contribution!

This sandwich is INCREDIBLE!  What's not to love?  The spread is really delicious and I've even whipped up a batch of it to spread on other sandwiches.  This is definitely a new favorite for my husband and I.

Good sandwich!!  It was very simple recipe to make and I liked the mayonnaise/sour cream mix on the sandwich although we used regular hot sauce instead of buffalo wing sauce.  Unfortunately we did not have any roasted red bell peppers as I would have liked to have tried them.

As written i would give this 3 stars, because shredded rotisserie chicken doesnt really fit.  I would recommend trying this recipe using larger pieces of baked or even grilled chicken, and serving with celery sticks to break up the dish.

5 Stars because my whole family (hubby and 4 kids!) devoured it!  I made it just as described, but added sweet pickles to it after it was cooked.  I also had plenty of chicken, so I made a few extras on hamburger buns, which we thought were better than  the italian bread.  The buns were soft and steamed.  Very good, we will definitely make it again!

This sandwich was really very good. I made a few tweaks that I think may have improved the flavor: First, I had some left over blue cheese I added to the sandwich before baking- I loved how this turned out. Also, I added some red onions which really kicked things up a notch. I also crumbled the bacon and mixed it with the chicken, spread the dressing on both sides of the bread (I didn't use all of it), and I baked this sandwich open on a baking sheet on about 350 for maybe 7-10 minutes, if that. It was perfect!

Poor man's version-hot dog buns, fajita chicken strips, bacon, mozarella cheese, sharp cheddar cheese, mayo, horseradish sauce and hot pepper sauce.  Sprinkle with crushed red peppers. My husband loved it!  However, will put original items on grocery list for next time!

This is a great recipe!  I mixed the sauce, then divided it in half & added an extra tablespoon of hot wing sauce (Franks) to half of it - that was for hubby and I.  The "tamer" half I used for our son.  I cut the loaf of Italian bread in half and made one spicy half w/pepperjack & spicy sauce; one "tamer" half w/cheddarjack & regular sauce.  I wrapped both halves tightly in foil and grilled them over indirect heat on a preheated grill at approx. 300-325 degrees for 25 minutes. (Too hot to start the oven!)  Very good - we will definitely be having this a lot during the summer!  Served it with a salad of romaine, tomatoes, shaved parmesan and ranch dressing.  Perfect!

I enjoyed this very much, but do agree that the wing sauce needs to be upped a bit. But then again I love heat. I added extra wing sauce on my finished sandwich. I also pre-marinated and grilled some chicken then shredded it, instead of using rotisserie chicken, so this definitely made it more flavourful. I left out the bell peppers cause I had none but do plan on trying them the next time around. Good recipe and combination of ingredients. Thanks for posting.

I served this at a get together last night and everyone enjoyed it.  I did not double the hot sauce only because one of the individuals does not care for anything too spicy.  I did add some fried onions on top of the chicken.  Very good will make again.

So quick & easy...  And sooo good!  My whole family loved this one!  I made half a little less spicy and the other a little more spicy for the 4 alarm enthusiasts in our family.  Skipped the peppers, just because I didn't have them on hand.  Thanks for sharing!!

Oh my these were delicious! Not too spicy, just perfect.  I didn't add the roasted peppers simply because I didn't have any.  I made them on homemade rolls and with homemade onion rings.  This is definitely being added in my rotation.

This sandwich was amazing! I kept laughing every time I looked at the Italian loaf, because I thought "this is just rediculously huge; there's no way we'll eat all this." Needless to say, my fiance and I ate 3/4 of the sandwich! I used 3/4 lb of bacon (about 10 slices), a 1/2 cup of sour cream rather than 1/4, 5 Tblsp of hot sauce rather than 2, a whole jar (4 oz) of roasted red peppers, and I gutted the top slice of the bread so the sandwich would close better. Instead of rotisserie chicken, I grilled 3 large boneless chicken breasts (seasoned with salt and pepper) then cut them into strips. I then mixed the chicken up with the sauce mixture before placing on the bread. This is probably my new favorite sandwhich! Thank you for the recipe!

This was a great sandwich! We left off the onions, because I didn't have any and I doubled the hot wing sauce.  Other than that, made it just as said and we enjoyed it!  Will definately make again!

Very good! I agree that more wing sauce is called for (I used Stubb's Wicked Chicken Wing Sauce, which is a lot more flavorful than Frank's - and still felt I was lacking a little). I made these sandwiches for my Quizno's-loving sons and they were thrilled. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Not super spicy but just enough of a kick. I used cheddar cheese instead of pepperjack and it was a good substitute, but a cheese like provolone would be perfect for this sub. We did this on a couple of sub rolls instead of a big Italian loaf, and we all loved it. Definitely saving this one.

Started by slicing my loaf of break lengthwise, brushing w/butter and sprinkling with a little garlic, toasted in 350 oven for 10 min's.  Then mixed my chicken with the buffalo "sauce" ingredients, added sliced pepperjack to each side of my toasted bread, slathered on the buffalo chicken and baked open face for about 10 minutes.  The sauce needed a little more buffalo than called for, but with that, and the added garlic seasoning on the bread, this was a winner for us.  :)  Thanks for the post!

Pretty delicious sandwiches.  I used sriracha sauce because I didn't have any "buffalo wing" sauce.  I made some French rolls, scooped out the middle, filled them with the chicken, place bacon on top of the chicken, replaced the top of the roll, and then melted the cheese on top of the entire thing.  They were beautiful and they weren't too messy.

This was fantastic!  I didn't use a rotisserie chicken but grilled my own chicken breast that I brushed with the buffalo wing sauce as well.  I didn't do the roasted red peppers only because I didn't have any and didn't have time to roast any up myself.  SO GOOD!

I did change a few things.  I used cibatta rolls since we were wrapping them in foil to put on the grill out camping and I used 1/2 C Greek Yogurt, 2 T. Mayonnaise and 4 T. Hot Sauce.  My husband and his friends loved them and wanted to know when we were having them again.

Made this last night for dinner. My family loved it. I didn't find Italian bread at my grocery store. Used chabatta baguette instead. Since my son does not like spicy food I have brushed part of the bread with majo-sour cream mix without the hot sauce. the rest I did exactly as recipe says. the bread came out perfect. I have served it with Cesar salad without the croûtons. Definitely will do it again. Also can be great for a potluck.

These are sooooo good. Not great for you, but super yummy. I've been using that sauce mixture on other sandwiches as well..BLTS it's excellent on. I added a little romaine to our sandwiches after cooking just to add a little veggie...

Everyone loved this sandwich! I didn't think it would be big enough to feed four adults but it definitely was! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I didn't change a thing!

I totally loved this sandwich. I did drizzle a little of the sauce over the chicken to give it extra flavor and an extra mess factor. I also added 2 slices of bacon to each sandwich. I used boilio (?) rolls instead of the Italian loaf. These sandwiches are great and work awesome as football food. A definite make again! Thanks for sharing!

This was well received by all.  We added extra hot wing sauce because it just wasn't spicy enough.  It is a great recipe though!

Delicious and different! I broiled the sandwich open faced for the last few minutes..I would agree that shredded lettuce and/or tomato would add a crunch to the sandwich, which I  will try next time. Thanks..for a great recipe!!

This was sooo good!!! I made ours on hoagie rolls rather than a whole loaf and it worked out perfect! It was perfectly spicy for us (I guess it just depends on the type of sauce you use). This will definitely be made again and again! OH, and I didn't use the red peppers out of personal preference!

Really good!!  The sauce is just spicy enough (which was surprising to me) and the pepperjack totally makes it.  I wasn't sure about the bacon but it gives that nice salty edge.  If you've got leftover cooked chicken in the freezer this is a fantastic quick and easy supper after a long day.

This went over really well at my house. My husband requested that I put this in our regular rotation. I took the advise of other reviews and added more hot sauce, otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating. I think it should have some Ranch or Blue Cheese in there somewhere too.

These were good, but they definitely did not taste what I was expecting them to. They need more "heat" to come off as buffalo chicken, as well as ranch or bleu cheese to compliment and "cool" the "heat".

Delicious! Could use a bit more buffalo flavor, but it was a huge hit with my picky husband!

This was a good and easy recipe. We really enjoyed it. The one variation that I made, was to add more buffalo sauce. We like things a little spicy, and adding a little more sauce gave it an extra kick. Overall good recipe.

This recipe was so simple to make and tasted great!  Couldn't locate Italian bread, but French bread seemed like a good alternative.
