This is a great cookie...good with tea. It could either be a mild spice cookie or a spiffed up sugar cookie.

This recipe directs you to roll the dough thin and cut out rounds but I didn't think I could get a good "cut" with pecans in the dough. I finally decided to roll the dough into a 10 onch log and roll the log in pecans. I chilled it again (like a refrigerator cookie) and sliced into 1/4 rounds. The result was a soft spice cookie that was actually tasty.
