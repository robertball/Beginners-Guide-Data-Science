The cake part is delicious and the creme filling is light, though I'm nervous about raw egg whites in it. I took the photo of this dish. It was a huge success at work. Most were gone within an hour. I'd make them slightly smaller than a tablespoon size. They really spread out when baked and mine all overla[ped. I had to cook for 9 mins, as 8 mins made the centers too wet. Let them sit for 5 minutes minimum on the cookie sheets or they will fold up funny on the spatula. Great recipe I will make again!

I found recipe to be excellent! I've never ever made Whoopie Pies and geesh...why I hadn't before is beyond me. I didn't grease a baking sheet on this recipe. I used parchment paper and that might be my bonus verses the last review, who said her spread. I totally try to cut extra oils where I can, but follow the recipes to the best of a T as possible. I didn't change anything with the cookie type part at all. The frosting center, was slightly thick, so I adjusted with a little more milk to make it just a bit creamier. Not much but I wanted that slightly ooze affect. And I'd say the frosting didn't taste of marshmallow but that's okay. Because the recipe was quite nice.

These are absolutely delicious! The cakes made up better than I was expecting, they were pretty well perfect. It was unclear how large the drops needed to be on the cookie sheet and how far apart they needed to be, I did about a tablespoon-size and a couple inches apart, which worked out perfect. I had my oven at 340 Fahrenheit convect, and they were done in about 9 minutes. I let them cool on the cookie sheet about 5 minutes, and transferred to cookie rack. The filling however, did not work for me at all! I didn't have enough shortening, so I substituted butter instead, and the filling emulsified and melted butter got everywhere. But, it was still extremely delicious. The recipe made a whopping 32 whoopie pies, way more than I was expecting! Next time I will probably either make just a meringue for the filling, or whipped cream. But, very tasty!

I love the "cakes" on this recipe...never fond of shorting fillings, even though that is traditional...I used a fluff recipe. I hate to see raters substitute ingred. and then rate it poorly..baking is a science, so adjusting or substituting can really wreck a good recipe...trust me, the cake is perfect, no other recipe will be the same. Disolving the baking soda in water then adding it makes all the difference. And again fillings are always subject to preference.

These where amazing,my cakes came out a little big and thick and I think I made more than 12.  I am trying different pans to see if that was the reason, however everyone loved them anyway. I followed the recipe exactly except instead of hot water I used hot coffee because it was right there and I didn't want it to go to waste.  I have never made whoopie pies before and this was a very easy recipe to follow.  I was nervous about making the marshmallow filling but it came out beautifully.

These little cakes are really good. They are very cakes, have a lot of chocolate flavor and are the perfect texture for whoopie pies. This recipe does make a lot, but that was fine for me. I used a small ice cream-like scoop, probably a tablespoon size and they were the perfect size for my needs. I baked them for 9 minutes and that was perfect, soft and cakey. I took them to a Super Bowl party this past weekend and they were a hit. I did not fill them with the filling from this recipe, instead used a filling from the Martha Stewart website, it was more marshmallow-like, which I liked. I will try the filling from this recipe next time because I had to make two batches of the other filling.

We have never made whoopie pies before and these are amazing! They are perfect cakes. I followed the advice on here and followed the recipe exactly (which does NOT call for baking powder). We did use the Martha Stewart filling as someone here suggested.

I liked the texture and taste of the cake. I cut the recipe in half since it was for only three people and still got 16 nice size cakes. I also used silicon baking pads instead of greasing a baking sheet. Worked great. I personally don't like the frosting too much. The texture was smooth but didn't like the flour taste. I will use my classic buttercream frosting recipe instead. But all in all was very happy.

I had my kid's cooking class prepare this recipe.  The cake texture is great but needs more chocolate flavor, so next time I'll add 1 oz. melted unsweetened chocolate.  For the filling, we skipped the egg whites and added 4 oz. cream cheese.  Also substituted half of the  filling's shortening with butter. It would've been helpful to know how big a "large spoonful" of batter was; We used a 1/2 oz. cookie scoop and got 17 Whoopie pies (34 cookies).

This is my favorite whoopie pie recipe and I consider myself a whoopie pie connoisseur! My husband and I had whoopie pies  stacked up for our wedding cake. I make them exactly as directed. I drop them by the tablespoon and get enough cakes to make 36 whoopie pies. I double the frosting. In my opinion, whoopie pies should be frozen, then served partially defrosted.
