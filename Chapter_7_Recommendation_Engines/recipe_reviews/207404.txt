Honestly, I made the sauce and made my own salad.  If I had known how to make this stuff myself, I'd have never told anyone and kept the recipe a personal secret!  This can also be used as a sauce.  I put it on leftover rice and jerk chicken and I plan to put it on breakfast burrito leftovers too.  The flavor is very clean and bright and much more healthy than any salad dressing.  An ingenious way to incorporate more beans into one's diet.  Protein power.

Great vinaigrette!  I did not use the hot pepper sauce, as I served it to my kids & they enjoyed it as well.  I used the vinaigrette with a Tex-Mex salad: romaine, black beans, corn, tomatoes, bell peppers & tortilla chips.  Very tasty - this will be a staple vinaigrette.

Points for creativity on the bean thing.  Unfortunately, being a bean-based dressing...it does taste like souped-up beans in my book.  Good beans, mind you, but still... I added more of the other stuff to kinda down-play the starch factor, and I splashed in plenty of green tabasco.  Then I sweetened it up with a little sugar, and guess what -- Total vinaigrette success! I did put it on a more Mexican-style salad per the previous poster's suggestion.  Yummy :)

The radicchio was a little too bitter with everything else.  Other than that I thought it was really good.  The salad dressing does not taste great on its own but when used as a dressing it is really good!

I made this dressing and it was fabulous! I used a 4 ounce can of hatch green chiles and only a half Tablespoon of olive oil and it was fantastic on our salad. It's a little thicker than true vinaigrettes, but packed full of flavor. I couldn't even tell it was made from beans to make it creamy! Yum :)

I really wanted to like this.  I LOVE hominy, and I'm always looking for tasty ways to make things healthier.  Unfortunately, I found the bean based dressing weighed the salad down too much.  The flavor was OK, though I did agree with a previous reviewer that the raddichio was too bitter for this salad.  If yo√∫ aren't bothered by a very heavy dressing, then give this one a try.  Unfortunately, it wasn't for us.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with mmm...foodness.  This just tastes like pureed beans.  I tried adding in more hot sauce and green chilies, but I couldn't improve it.
