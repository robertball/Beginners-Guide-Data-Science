Jules2Jewels You are lucky your grandmother made these for you. We really liked them. A nice coconutty chew and a little crisp on the edge is just the way I like them. I threw a few butterscotch chips in the last batch, thought they were great with and without. Baking for 9 minutes worked perfectly for me

I used 1/4 cup less of both sugars as other reviews mentioned, added 1/4 tsp extra of baking powder, and chilled for about 30 minutes before baking.  These were exactly what I was looking for, like a Ranger cookie!  Shared some with a friend and neighbor, even after seveal days the cookies that were left were still soft.  My new favorite!

They cookies were good.  We went directly off this recipe.  However, they did end up very thin... Which is not what I had expected by looking at the picture on this recipe.

Every once in a while you find a recipe that you absolutely love.  For me, this is one of those recipes.  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it was just perfect.  The only change I made was to increase the baking time because I love cookies that have a little crunch.  Thanks for sharing your Grandmother’s recipe.

This was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly and these little guys turned out perfectly. I'm a sucker for rice krispies in desert-form, so their addition was original and necessary.

This is my default cookie recipe now. Thanks to the original poster.

I've looked for this recipe but never could find it. My mother made them in the 40's. I have to tweet the recipe for high altitude so not as much sugar and a little more flour or they spread too much and are way too thin. Thanks very much for the recipe. I'll make them today

Good recipe.  I did not add the white sugar, the recipe turned out good, and was plenty sweet.  I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Will make it again.

My mom always made a recipe similar to this. My cookies are not flat and greasy at all.  I'm giving 4 stars because this recipe needs more oats and Rice Krispies. I think my moms recipe is 5-star. ;)

My mom's recipe uses 1 cup Crisco, equal amounts of sugars (1 cup), 1 tsp of baking soda (no baking powder), 1 tsp vanilla (rather than 1 TB) and 2 cups each oats and Rice Krispies.  The other listed ingredients were the same. 

I love these. I have to smoosh the dough together, as it's dense and can fall apart a little. I like them crunchy, so 10-12 min on 350 is about perfect.

I posted a picture of how mine turn out. They definitely look different than all the others. ;)

It was so good, probably one of my favouritest recipes ever! Definitely will be making more of these cookies in the future. The only problem I had was that they needed to cook a bit longer

This recipe is fantastic!  I only put in 1 cup of brown and 1 cup of white sugar (ran out of brown), but the recipe was lots sweet enough.  I also pre-toasted my coconut in the oven before adding to the cookie dough.  Cooking time seemed okay.  Thanks for the recipe.  (I added chocolate chips and raisins to the dough, and this still turned out great.

I made this as described, turned out way too thin. It didn't look thin before baking, however, they spread way big! I suggest you place rather small ball on the cooking sheet, perhaps less than 1 TB size with 2" apart.  I did generous amount with a rule of thumb 2", and they all joined together!! Also too sticky to the baking sheet however the dough was soft, therefore a lot work to get them off the baking sheet! A lot of cookies were not presentable to my guest tonight, so I felt waste good amount of cookie dough.  Something has to be adjusted, amount of flour or liquid.  Also it look approx 12 min to be cooked, longer than 9 min.  However, the taste was good.  I liked the coconut texture with a bit of crunchiness.

This recipe is oddly similar to the well known ranger cookies with 2 very important things missing; an extra cup of Rice Krispies and an extra cup of oats. These were very thin as others have mentioned.

This is my favourite oatmeal cookie recipe. The chewy coconut and the crunch of the rice krispies together give these cookies a nice texture. I made it exactly as written. It was the right amount of sweetness, they were a little bit thin, but still great.

I loved the sound of this recipe and read all the trouble shooting ideas so I used 3 cups of flour and I used only 1cup of each of the sugars. I don't buy rice crispies so I omitted these. I also added 1cup of craisins and toasted my coconut.  With these additions I baked them for 12 minutes and they came out perfect. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is really, really good!  I love them with rice crispies; however, I have an old recipe that calls for crushed corn flakes instead.  I've made this recipe changing the rice crispies for the corn flakes and I think I prefer them.  The crunch of the corn flakes with oatmeal and coconut............yum!

I will make them again, saved to my favs. But I did decrease the sugars by about a 1/4 c. each. And CHILL them before you put them in the oven, makes them so they do not spread so much.  And make sure your butter is not melted, just barely softened.

These cookies are wonderful with a chewy caramel taste. What an awesome recipe for your grandmother to hand down to you. My children love them and so do I. These will become my new "go to" oatmeal cookie recipe. The center is soft when they come out of the oven so definitely let them cool a little on the baking sheet before removing.

Warning!  This cookie dough is too thin!  After I baked the first tray, I added flour & oatmeal to the dough.  I also shaped the cookies and rolled them in flour.  These cookies were much better.  We enjoyed the cookies and they had nice flavour.  I will make them again, BUT I will add flour.

These are the most delicious cookies ever -- even my daughter, who swears she doesn't like coconut, loved these and couldn't stay away! They didn't last long in our house as the whole family enjoyed them immensely. I made the recipe as written.

These cookies are delicious.  Chewy with a nice crunch. It made about 36 to 40, but we made them a little bigger. They did spread out some and were not as thick as the pic. That's just the way we like them.....as did everyone else!

Amazing! I took the other reviewers advice and put 1/4 cup less of each sugar. I also used sweetened shredded coconut as I wasn't sure which to buy.  Put the dough in the fridge for 45 minutes and the next baked. Soooooo goood!!!!!

This recipe is amazing!  I took the advice of others and cut back on the sugars and added more cereal.  I love this recipe and will be making it again and again!

Fantastic cookie. The middle of the cookie is chewy and soft with a little give (thanks to the brown sugar and coconut) and the edges turn out a little crispy.

I made the recipe exactly as described with one exception - I allowed the cookies to rest on the sheet pans for 8 minutes versus 2-3 minutes. I found that this longer time helped the cookies set-up properly because after 9 minutes in the oven when you pull the cookies out - the middle of the cookie appears ever so slightly wiggly/raw. The cooling down on the warm sheet pan allows for the middle to set properly and develops the "crispness" on the underside of the cookie.

My cookies did not turn out too flat, but they definitely were not "puffy". I would definitely make these again!

These are awesome.  I cut back on the sugar and added a bit more flour for our altitude.
Hubby said they are additive.  My new favorite go to cookie.

Chewy, Soft & the Rice Krispies give that soft crunch.


Didn’t have oatmeal substituted for instant individual packages works great. Also like this over other recipes calls for 1 cup of oatmeal not 2.

Very delicious! Crispy on the outside yet chewy on the inside. I would make them again. I made them with Uncle Bob's Red Mill Gluten-free 1-1 flour substitute and I don't think you would ever guess they are gluten-free. The first time I made them I must have put in too much butter or something because they spread out everywhere and had to be broken into pieces to enjoy, but in subsequent attempts they turned out perfect and are my new favorite cookie! Everyone I have shared them with asks for the recipe. Thanks Grandmother!

These are amazing! Everybody loves these amazing cookies. I do use slightly less sugar (1 cup brown and 3/4 white seems to be enough for me)

I think they would be great with added cocoa, or white chocolate chips, or other goodies- I'll be trying a few variations! But they are terrific as is. I do not have trouble with them spreading too much but I use the smaller, instant type oats and slightly less sugar, and my 1 TBS cookie dough schoop and do not flatten the balls at all. (when I use my cookie scoop the recipe makes about 70 cookies)

I followed it exactly.
Super easy, quite sweet, will reduce both sugars next time.
Made at least 5 dozen decent sized cookies.
Recommend this recipe!

These are yummy cookies!  I found that baking  one sheet of cookies at a time helped to keep them from spreading out.  When I make them again, I'll reduce the amount of sugar and add a little extra flour - just because I don't need them to be that sweet, and because I like my cookies a little less thin.

Two thumbs up! These are delicious cookies! I love the way they spread out so they are a bit thin. They are crunchy outside and chewy inside. Perfection! Unfortunately I didn't have coconut so I put in a little more Rice Cereal. Also I reduced the brown sugar and the white sugar by 1/4 cup each. They were still sweet enough and I may even reduce the sugars a bit more next time. These were exactly what I was looking for.

The taste was just like my grandma made back in the 60s. I will make these again, but since they spread badly during baking, I will 1) add two tablespoons of flour and 2) chill the dough before baking. If I could get them to look like the photo, they'd be a definite five-star in my book!

These cookies were pretty good. We were out of vanilla but they still turned out fine. They had the taste and texture I was going for. They didn't look very good coming out of the oven and I had to cut off the edges, but after that they looked good. My whole family loved them and so did I! Coconut cookies are difficult so, nice job!

So yummy!  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all and these cookies were great!  Next time, and there will be a next time!, I'll add some chocolate chips and/or nuts.
Grandma knows best!!!

Took much longer to cook- maybe because of high altitude. Could use less brown sugar.

I didn't have any rice cereal on hand so I doubled up on the oats (2 cups total) and cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup and they turned out great!! They have a great flavour to them from the coconut. 
Thanks for the recipe, I am definitely making these again!

So good! I made these as written except I did them dairy free by replacing the butter with a red palm and coconut oil shortening. They were excellent and got gobbled quickly by the family. I loved the crunch of the rice krispies - very different.

I made these cookies for a family friend for his birthday. But, rather than the cookies actually being a present for him, it was more of an excuse just so I could try out this awesome recipe. I have never thought of putting rice krispies in a cookies, let alone with oats and coconut, before and I was surprised to find that this recipe was a hit. They do come out thin, but I think that is a factor of what makes them so delicious. 

I used whole-wheat flour simply because I just ran out of all-purpose flour and was too lazy to run to the store, and they tasted just fine.

These worked out great.  Not flat (I dropped by balls rather than flattening).  I used Special K instead of rice krispies.  Kid approved.

Awesome! I made these with a few changes. First I doubled the batter because that wouldnt have been nearly enough for my son and his friends lol. I used unsweeetened coconut because this recipe already had enough sugar. I also added a 10 oz jar of lemon curd simply because I didnt know what else to do with it....WINNER!!!!!  this will be my new favorite cookie recipe.

Delicious! Amazing texture. I used *sweetened* flaked coconut, so I decided to only add 1/4 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup. I'll probably leave out the white sugar altogether next time because it was plenty sweet.

The BEST ever oatmeal coconut cookies!!!! My boyfriend wanted oatmeal coconut cookies for a Christmas , sooo I made them using Christmas coloured rice crispies! They were a big hit with EVERYONE!  I too reduced the sugar as our first batch we found too sweet.

Crispy, chewy, sweet cookie.  Cooking time was longer, 15 minutes.
