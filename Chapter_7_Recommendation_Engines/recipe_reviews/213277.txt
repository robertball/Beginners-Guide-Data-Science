I found a similar recipe on a picante sauce web site, I added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and threw in some onions! Very good!

It was a new taste and the little guys really liked it. I did it partly on the grill then cut them up and finished them in the oven with the sauce drizzled over and covered.  I will make it again... very easy.

I didnt use chicken breasts I used chicken legs. I followed everything else to the letter. My little girl liked this and it wasnt too spicy for her. She did dip hers into ranch and my step son followed suit. I dont know if I will make this again but it was easy.

It is quick and easy to make but it is nothing special for taste.
