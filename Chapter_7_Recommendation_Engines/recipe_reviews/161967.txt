I just did one small difference from the recipe, when I brought the sauce ingredients to a boil, I mixed up a little corn starch with cold water and thickened it.

I had all the ingredients on hand so I thought I would try this. It was a very light and delicate meal. I didn't have Holland House white cooking wine, so I substituted my homemade white wine and I doubled the sauce because I made 6 chicken breasts. We all liked this dish, but I thought the sauce was pretty thin and ran right through the noodles and pooled on the plate. This would be a great summer dinner if you are looking for something not too heavy. I would probably make it again, but I am still in search for that perfect chicken picata recipe.

This is really different, very tasty and the first time we had ever tasted capers.  Will make this again.  Did use a good white wine instead of the cooking wine.  Yummy!

My husband and I really liked this one! We ommitted the capers (my husband hates them) and changed the sauce around a little. I added 2 cups of chicken broth, instead of one and added a little cornstarch to thicken it. It was delicious!

I had tried several recipes and nothing was right until this one. So good! I did add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce but that's the only real change. I usually only cook 2 breasts but don't change the liquid amounts so there is more sauce.

Delicious...will definately make again...added a bit of flour to thicken sauce.  Will cut back on lemon juice a tiny bit next time.

There wasn't enough sauce and it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I was disappointed with this.

I didn't make too many changes to this recipe. The only thing different I do is I season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder. After I add the ingredients for the sauce to the pan, I add heavy whipping cream and simmer until it thickens to my liking. The heavy cream really makes this dish and This makes a great meal served over angel hair pasta!

I had to change this a little -- had no capers.  I used a chopped onion that I cooked with the chicken.  We LOVED this.  My nephew came over and he loved it too.  I would make a little more sauce and I will try it with capers. Yum.
