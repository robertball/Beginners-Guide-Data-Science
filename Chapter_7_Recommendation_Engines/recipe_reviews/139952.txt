I love this recipe. I think I may know what is happening with the "wispy thread". If you are holding your spoon over the pan of boiling sugar and water, the steam melts the thread. You have to drip it from the spoon away from the saucepan. I hold it over the pan's lid.

I made this with cherry jello and it was very good. I did not have corn syrup so I added 1/4 tsp of cream of tarter to the egg whites. I boiled the syrup in the microwave in a glass measuring cup for easy cleanup (about 10 minutes) I also used a stand mixer.It made SOOO much frosting though. It frosted a whole sponge tube cake (glorious sponge cake from this site)with enough frosting so you could not see the hole (at least 2 inches of frosting) and had enough left over for a whole large cool whip container. I would try half the recipe next time. My son has alread requested orange jello frosting. So much easier than traditional seven-minute.

its funny...i thought the frosting wouldn't turn out right but it turned out perfectly! the sugur that i was supposed 2 boil over the stove, got clear once it started to boil.. but it wouldnt get to the stringing whispy consistance when dripping from a spoon. and i wasnt going to wait for it to turn into rock candy! so i took it off a couple mins after it got clear. and then mixed in the strawberry gelitin and whipped the egg whites into the sugar mixture for about 5 mins and it turned out perfectly! very rich but not that overfilling feeling after eating marshmallows. PERFECT!

Wonderful recipe! I've never made a boiled frosting before, so this was a first attempt for mer, and it turned our great! I used unrflavoured gelatin and added a little vanilla to the finished product, and it tasted exactly like marshmallow (except even better!) The author is right when she says to use it right away. I put it in the fridge for a little while to use for later, and it set up so that it was too thick to spread. But heating it gently over some simmering water in a double boiler got it thin enough so that I could spread it. I also used it as a "cream" filling for some chocolate cupcakes and every body loved it. Thank you, your mom!

It was really good especially on tres-leches cake because the cake itself is rich.  The frosting is sweet but not too sweet and I used sugar free strawberry gelatin and it came out great.  I'm using that again on my tres-leches cake.

I had trouble with this -- couldn't find a thermometer, and the stuff in the pot never formed a "wispy thread", so I kept cooking...and it thickened almost to a solid and I had to toss it and start again.  I did eventually get it, and it came out okay, but I don't think I'll make this again -- it's just too artificial-tasting.

Recipe turned out wonderful.  Very easy to make, took about 10 minutes to get the syrup right.  Made enough for a very large angel food.

I didn't think this was going to turn out, but surprisingly it did and it was DELICIOUS. It tastes like a strawberry sucker! I wouldn't recommend using this to frost a layer cake, becuase its so gooey that it kind of just slides off. It gave me some trouble..

This was so gooey and sticky and sweet, yum.  I used blueberry jelly, topped icecream cone cupcakes with sprinkles on top - looked just like little icecreams and the kids loved them.  I overcooked the first batch and had to start again.  I found that when it was ready when it bubbled heaps and became thick and more syrupy, rather than stringy.  Would definately use again.  Don't know what to do with the left overs though?

Probably the most delishous cupcake topper ever!!! So much better than basic frosting! Love the bold strawberry flavor (I bet it would be great with any jello flavor). It was super easy to make, even though I messed up a little by adding the jello mix to the sugar and boiling it. I just boiled the mixture till it bubbled and wasn't too concerned on it being thready. So simple but tastes sooo good! I used it to top angel food cupcakes and it looked professional and so yummy! Looks great alone or with sprinkles and other toppers. Easy to spread with a knife or pipe (tried both). It holds its shape when you spread it leaving a perfect swirl at the top. I can't say enough great things about it, will definitely keep and make again! Thanks so much for posting it!
**UPDATE** I made this again last night with raspberry jello and it was just as awesome! I put it on chocolate angel food cupcakes and it looked perfect. I prefer the strawberry flavor but others liked the raspberry.

My kitchen is a gigantic pink sticky mess right now, and my angel food cupcakes have no frosting.  Normally I try a recipe a second time before determining whether I like it or not, but this time I am not sure if I dare attempt a second try.  I admit that it is probably my fault that this did not turn out, but I routinely make mistakes with cooking and other recipes, but without ending in chaos and disaster like this.  I should mention that I used liquid egg whites, rather than actual real eggs/egg whites, which I will NEVER do again.  And I really might just be mad that my stovetop, floor, counters, and just about every other surface in my kitchen is somehow covered in pink stickiness.  Totally not worth the trouble for me.

I have to say, after reading some of the difficulties others had with this recipe I was a little nervous to make it myself.  I took the advice to start whipping the egg whites while the syrup was still boiling.  I actually had huge success with this recipe.  Everyone loved how deliciously marshmallowy it was.  It really has just the right amount of strawberry sweetness.

It doesn't last very long though.  The batch was way more than I needed, and since I wasn't able to use it right away the leftover frosting became very grainy and was unusable after about 48 hours.  

I'll definitely make it again, but just make sure I'm using all of it right away so none goes to waste :)

This was very tasty. I used blueberry jello, any flavor works great. I had a little trouble with it, when I added the jello to the syrup it started to set up and was grainy. I think next time I'll add the jello at the beginning and let it boil and dissolve, or add it to the egg whites after beating and before adding the syrup (like with divinity). I will definatly be making this again and tweaking it until I get it right. The frosting consistency was perfect (aside from the tasty flavor granules) and it made enough to frost two round angel food cakes.

Just as described. I made this for frosting on cupcakes for my daughter's preschool party and everyone just had to have the frosting recipe! I did strawberry flavor on top of white cake cupcakes for valentine's day and topped each with a slice of strawberry in the shape of a heart. The frosting goes perfectly with white cake. Also, you can pipe it. I used a large star cupcake frosting tip and it came out very pretty.

Not sure how others got this to turn out so well. The directions are backwards. You need to have the egg whites ready first. You will not have time to whip them after you make the syrup. Got the same result as one of the others-- it turned rick hard upon sitting. Salvaged some, if you could work around the chunks! It was very sweet.

Oh My Word!  This is like strawberry marshmallow cream.  It is so light and fluffy and sweet.  I made it exactly as the recipe indicates, and it turned out perfect.  This is my new go-to for any fruit frosting... it would be delish as cherry or perhaps even lime!  So tasty and really quite simple.  Thank you!

This was pretty simple, and did taste good. My biggest complaint is that the finished frosting was kind of grainy from the Jello that didn't dissolve all the way. It was deliciously light and fluffy, just like marshmallow creme. It made a TON- I frosted 20 cupcakes (pretty generously) and probably could've done 20 more! I will try it again, maybe giving the gelatin more time to dissolve.

Didn't make any changes.  Made it just as recipe called for.  It was a little gritty from the gelatin, but you know what?  That's what I like about it so much that makes it special.  To me it tastes like and has the texture of cotton candy.  Yummm!  Have made several times and will make again.  I love this on top of banana cake the best!

Turned out great. My jello and sugar mixture froze up a bit so I added a tiny bit of warm water and it loosened up again. I used lime jello and the frosting turned out so light and fluffy I put piles of it on my cupcakes. Yum!

Technically this is an incorrect rating, as I was unable to finish it.    I know others commented that theirs turned rock-hard, and mine did too.  I will say the corn syrup was old, but somehow I think this was operator error.  I have no idea what I did wrong, but I have a small sauce pot half full with rock hard "candy".  I had to run out and buy frosting and in my rush I left it in the pot with the whisk.  They have become one.  lol  I'm hoping I can melt it back down and save my pot and whisk!  I admit, I'm afraid to try it again!

This is an amazing recipe. I did not add the jello, because I wanted more of a marshmallow frosting.  It came out perfect.

Delicious. It doesn't keep well, but that's usually not a problem. I use it to frost cupcakes made with the Simple White Cake recipe.

I loved this recipe! I put it on top of a banana cake for my daughter's birthday, and the cake and frosing really complimented each other.  I whipped the egg whites beforehand, because after reading the recipe, I thought it would easier that way.  However, for some reason, the frosting was a little grainy. Maybe I needed to mix it more and/or longer...but you know what?  The graininess made it TOTALLY AWESOME!  It reminded me of cotton candy!!  Really super good!!!  This was a delicious frosting, and such a stellar recipe.  I love it, I higly recommend it and I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will try using white chocolate pudding mix instead of strawberry jello and I think it just might work for the princess cake I will be making.

I gave this recipe 2 stars because it tasted good but I should have read the reviews before I made it.  After adding the jello my niece and I worked to get it off the sides of the saucepan to put into the whipped egg whites.  The group I served it to was none the wiser.  I just said it was strawberry "candies". Good taste but hard to work with.

This did not work out at all. Maybe I did something wrong, but nothing went right.

My family wasn't liking this type of frosting.  Way to sweet and odd texture.

Turned out PERFECT! Made a slight adjustment at the end since mine was grainy and not smooth as others had said. Fixed that by adding small amounts of water (1 Tbs at a time), letting the jello granules have a moment to absorb, beat on high until reforms a good thick consistancy and continue over and over till it was completely creamy!!! As a side note, I also started beating the egg white to get that ready while about 1/2 way done boiling the sugar mixture and glad I did because I discovered that once the sugar mixture was done and after adding the jello, it hardens VERY quickly and should be added to the "soft peeking beaten egg white" SOON!!

Would have rated this way higher if it turned out right!! I really thought I messed it up, until I logged back in to check the reviews again and someone else said they had the same mishap.  Mine turned rock hard but I tried to use it anyways and was grainy and had big hard chunks in it, I am going to try it again because I used berry fusion flavored jello and I LOVED the flavor.  Let you know how the next batch turns out.

The strawberry flavor is overwhelming and way too strong. Use sparingly. Good texture and dried to a light crusty topping.

Too sticky and tasted artificially sweet. Recipe also makes a ton, even halving it was more than enough for the cake.

Very sweet yet tasty icing! Made it with cherry jello for chocolate cupcakes for my boyfriend on Valentine's day. He loved it! This recipe also makes a LOT of frosting! The only problem I had was attaining the "wispy thread". It hardened after boiling for too long. I still used it, but of course it was somewhat grainy. I'd definitely take it off the heat once it turns clear- at that point it's on the verge of rock candy!

This frosting looks great! Not big on the taste, it's VERY sweet. It's the only frosting I have ever made that actually holds it's shape though! Anyone have a recipe like this for a chocolate frosting? Thanks for sharing.

I will try this again although it didn't turn out perfectly.  For some reason my frosting remained a little grainy despite being whipped for a good long time in the stand mixer.  My little girl loved it on her birthday cupcakes though and so did her friends.
