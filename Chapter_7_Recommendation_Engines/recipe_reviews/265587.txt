This is definitely two big servings, not just one. This tasted fine, but I liked it better heated and with a little more almond milk (which I used instead of soy). I'm not sure what pea protein powder is, so I used regular chocolate protein powder. I don't quite understand why the directions say to mix in a separate bowl and then transfer to a mason jar. I smashed the banana in the bottom of the jar and layered all the other ingredients on top. Then I put the lid on and shook the jar up. Worked perfectly.
