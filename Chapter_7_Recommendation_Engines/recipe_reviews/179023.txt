I actually thought these were good for a lower fat, lower sodium version of the original.  As for the only other review so far - the directions do say to cook the beans first.....I cooked mine till they were done and had no problem with hard beans. I did use non-fat milk. Only other comment I have is the picture provided by Campbell's definitely has more than 2 tbls. of the french fried onions but heck - I cheated too and added more.  I love those things!  Will use this recipe always in lieu of the original when I'm craving green bean casserole which isn't too often but occasionally.

This "healthful" version of traditional green bean casserole was very good.  No one at the table knew the difference.

This recipe is OK. Unless you like hard vegetables, cook the beans really well before putting in this dish... or buy two or three cans of green beans and use those instead. I also added chopped ham to mine... which would have been great if everything else wasn't crunchy (probably my own fault for not cooking beans enough prior to.) Perhaps this should be cooked at a higher temp.

We nade the healthy version of Green Bean Casserole and was pleasantly surprised at how much like the original. I did use frozen beans instead of fresh and had no problem getting them done. The family wondered why I went so light on the onions so next time, I will add a few more. This is quite good. I will make this from now on instead of the original.

Got great reviews at my Thanksgiving dinner. Doubled the recipe.  There wasn't enough sauce, so I added a 1/3 more sauce (extra soup left in the can).  Plus I used almost a whole large can of the onions -- it didn't seem over powering though.

Very good, but the recipe would be better written with cooking the beans as part of the instructions.  I didn't see the notes about pre-cooking the beans in the ingredients list and the rest of my holiday dinner was timed to be finished at the same time, but the beans were still not thoroughly cooked.

This is how I have made the green bean casserole from the original version, without seeing this recipe. I'm not sure if anyone knew the difference because my in laws seem to be heavy handed with salt while cooking, but I really didn't care. I don't care for all that salt and figured they could add salt if they felt it to be too bland. I however wouldn't skimp on the French's French Fried Onions! Also, the original version calls for a full cup of milk which makes it runny and soggy to me. So even if you prefer the other soup to this healthier version, take the less milk approach! Much better in my opinion!

Kept right with the recipe and enjoyed it.  I thought I'd miss the traditional flavor and the water chestnuts, but no. Very easy!

Great recipe using fresh green beans as opposed to all the ones calling for canned. I added (and balanced it into the recipe) fresh mushrooms. Added more soup and about 1/2 cup of fresh onion instead of onion powder. If you like you veggies crunchy...use the cook time specified. Otherwise, consider cooking it longer before adding the fried onions (stir more often to keep from burning).
