I used Truvia instead of Splenda. This was okay. Both my husband and I thought that this needed a few more tea bags and maybe less Truvia. When combining the Truvia with the lemonade concentrate, it was a little too sweet for us.

Iced tea is definitely cool and refreshing - especially on a hot summer day!  This was a nice half tea/half lemonade drink. And, it's definitely sweet so I did cut the amount of Splenda in half. Even with that it was a bit sweet for my taste, but my husband didn't seem to mind..

Was "OK", kids didn't like the Splenda taste.
