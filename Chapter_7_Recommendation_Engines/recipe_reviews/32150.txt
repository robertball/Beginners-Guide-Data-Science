Quick dinner tonight--I doubled this to make two sandwiches. I made this exact, using reduced fat mayonnaise and whole wheat bread. I paired this with homemade chunky tomato soup. Kids thought this was great.

I think some of the reveiws where very harsh in what they said.  Sometimes we need to be reminded of the simple things in life.  This could be a starter sandwich and then you could use your imagination on what to add to your sandwich.  Thanks Lorraine for reminding us about the simple things.

It was too rainy last night to grill, so we made club sandwiches instead.  There's nothing like hickory smoked bacon, fresh tomatoes, leafy green lettuce (as opposed to iceberg), and Boar's head turkey breast.  I also added some swiss cheese.  This was so good between toasted bread with a bit of mayo.  All that was left was to add a dill pickle and some kettle cooked chips.  Sometimes the simplest meals are the best!

This is a basic club sandwich you'll find on the menus of most restaurants in Canada with the exception, it doesn't include cheese whether it be processed or swiss. I always add salt and pepper, in moderation, to the tomatoes. I also find Miracle Whip rather than mayonnaise adds a little more pizzazz.

This a good basic recipe.  I used the 3 pieces as stated, however, I layered the turkey, bacon, veggie mix on both layers.  I also added avocado to the sandwich and served with a sliced dill pickle.

A "good" sandwich. With the exception of the third peice of bread (in the middle of the sandwich) - its much like the sandwiches I make normally. We tried one sandwich with 3 peices of toast but prefer to cram all the meat & veggies between 2 peices.  I also added some red onion and a squirt of dijon mustard. Thanks!

It sure is nice when someone takes the time and effort to provide guidelines (which may seem easy to some but are a real bonus for a learner like I am) to resolve the need for a quick snack.  It's also nice to see Hellman's seeming support for allrecipes.com.  I use nothing else but Hellman's because it is the only one I can find without SOY !

Sometimes basic is best.  Added some Colby Jack cheese and it was delicious.  Definately a keeper for those lazy Saturday afternoon lunches.  Thanks for the post.

I made these over the weekend.  They were not mind blowing, but they were good.  More important, they were fast and easy.  I microwaved my bacon to speed up and make clean up easier.

You would think it's crazy to have a recipe for a club sandwich. Like who doesn't know how to throw a sandwich together but it reminded me how long it's been since I had one. So I made this sandwich and my family went crazy. I added cheese, onion and lettuce to them. I put thousand Island dressing on mine and it was awesome. I served it with potato chips and it was so good. Something so simple made everyone so happy. Great for a quick supper.

This is my favorite sandwich. I used 4 slices bacon per sandwich. Shortcut was precooked bacon, so only had to crisp it in the microwave for a few seconds. I didn't stick to measurements as we like a deli style sandwich, (translated - piled high). I used shredded iceberg lettuce as well then sprinkled with salt and pepper. I built mine as a BLT on one side and then the shaved ham, shaved turkey, and aged swiss cheese on the other. YUMMERS! Tip: Cut these into quarters and use toothpicks to secure. My kids call this sandwich, "Mom's Masterpiece Sandwiches". I used rye bread because I like it, but my son liked his on white bread, toasted.

A wonderful club sandwich, just like one that you would pay $8-$10 for at a restaurant.  The only change I made was to add some ham to each sandwich.  We quadrupled the recipe to serve our family of 5, and everyone was more than happy.

Very good for a picnic!  We used turkey bacon and whole wheat bread.  We served them with fruit salad, corn on the cob, and baked beans.

Very Good Flavor Combination, But I Used 4oz Of Roasted "Real Turkey" Slices. Added Salt, And Pepper, Onion Slices, Cheddar Cheese, And Used Only Two Slice Of Neo-Tuscan Artisan Bread. Even Though I Made Large Modifications The Idea Of Bacon And Turkey Is A Great Combination.

Your basic club sandwich recipe and I love that you can find a basic recipe on this site. We prefer the breast lightly toasted and the bacon crisp.

This is a good basic recipe for beginner cooks. Kinda like a grilled cheese.
But everyone needs a starting point!
Personally, I prefer this type of sandwich with the addition of avocado, and Ranch dressing as opposed to Mayo.
In any event and whatever your personal preference, it's a true classic. Thank you, Lorraine... for the post.

Good sandwich.  I second the pre-cooked bacon.  I was a little "shy" about using it until this recipe, but it is sooo much easier.  We also used rye bread for this sandwich.

Great for leftover turkey! Buttered my bread and toasted it slightly in the oven. I built my sandwich with 2 breads though.

I made this for lunch today. Instead of tomato I added pickles, and I didn't have any ham at home. So basicaly I just had turkey, bacon, lettuce, pickles and mayo with toasted bread but it was amazing!

We loved it! I cooked up some turkey bacon in a skillet, toasted the bread, spread mayonnaise on each piece, put a piece of provolone cheese down topped with black forest deli turkey and romaine lettuce. Then put another piece of bread on top of that, and put 2 pieces of bacon, tomato, and a little more turkey. Cut into four's, secured with toothpicks, and served with a pickle. Delicious:) Thanks so much!

Had this sandwich twice in the last few days, not that I needed a recipe to make a club, but was a good reminder, of a very good, and easy meal.  Served with fries.  Thanks for a great reminder!!

Thanks Lorraine for reminding us that a Sandwich can be a great Saturday Night meal! I was scrambling at the last minute of a very busy day and remembered seeing this pictured on the front page yesterday. Served with Old Fashioned Onion Rings from this site and it was better than any carry out that I could have ordered. Thanks for sharing and the reminder!

We like to omit the third slice of bread, add onion and sometimes a slice of swiss cheese. Hubby likes a little mustard on his. Make sure that you toast the bread prior to spreading the mayo. I didn't think that the recipe was clear on that.

This is simple, quick and delicious. This sandwich is a classic and the toasted bread with a little mayo, deli turkey breast, turkey bacon and fresh locally grown manoa lettuce with slices of tomato is the most satisfying meal...I served this with hot soup. yum! UPDATE: My son liked this so much he asked for it again the very next day!!

Easy to make and very good. The trick to a good club sandwich is to use thick bacon fresh from your local butcher.

You wouldn't think you would need a recipe for something so basic, but the stacking order makes a big difference in the taste of a club sandwich. I like the meat at the top and the bottom and everything else in the middle. And of course, I add cheese.

Although this is a simple recipe, it was a nice change of pace for a quick and easy weeknight meal. I didn't put any lettuce on the sandwiches, but served a side salad with them. Sometimes we need to be reminded of the simple things :). Thanks, Lorraine!

Yikes,  As easy  as this recipe is, did anyone notice the nutritional value?  874 cals and 69 gr fat?  It would get more stars if it could be healthier!

Good sandwich.  Use any type of bread, cheese, or meat combination.  With a busy schedule, as everyone has, Club's are the way to go.

Though there isn't really anything special about this recipe...it's a club sandwich after all...I made it simply because I hadn't had a club sandwich in a long time. It was an easy and good sandwich.

I used deli sliced buffalo chicken & turkey bacon instead of turkey and bacon. Regular white bread works better than thick sliced loafs like sourdough.

This was the perfect quick dinner for a Sunday night and brought back memories from my childhood of going to the local diner.  It was easy to get together and very tasty!  I did use fresh turkey breast that I had left over in the freezer from Thanksgiving and I think the fresh turkey made all the difference.

I agree, some reviews on here are quite harsh. It's the simple things in life that make all the difference. This is a great, basic recipe to build upon. I'm happy to see a fellow cook provide guidelines for newbie cooks to follow (we all have to start somewhere, right?). Use your imagination and have fun with this. In keeping with my own advice, I used thick-cut peppered bacon (and LOTS of it!), hearty oat bread and garlic herb mayo. I also added several avocado slices to my sandwich (but not to my hubs' - he isn't a fan). Potato chips and a dill pickle spear hit the spot and and paired perfectly with our sandwiches. Thanks for sharing, Ms. Winkel! :-)

This was just what I was looking for.  I did add a slice of ham too with the turkey as I think a real club has that.  I appreciate how the layering was explained in the recipe.
