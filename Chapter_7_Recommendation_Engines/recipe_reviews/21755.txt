Easy to make - a wonderful Saturday morning treat!  Loved the orange flavored sauce.

Pretty tasty for bisquick.  I wasn't expecting too much for these but they surprised me, they came out very good.  Light & airy and yummy.  I added a little bit more milk as well as a pinch of sugar.  One thing to really watch out for, don't make these too huge because the edges will start to crack and not make a nice looking crepe.  These are especially good slathered with Nutella.

Made this for Valentine's Day and by far the best I've ever made. Crepes were incredible lite and is the key to this dish. Excellent!!
