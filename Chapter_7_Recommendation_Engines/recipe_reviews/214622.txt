Delightful!  I had a chicken and pasta dish that looked a bit bland, whipped this up and... voila! Looked and tasted gourmet.  I even made it simpler by pulsing in my food processor until it was the right consistency.  Thanks Phil!

Quick and easy, yet tasty. This makes a very small amount and is perfect for add to slices of french or sour dough bread before I grill them. Also, this is great on pasta with or without marinara. Phil's suggestion of swirling it into tomatos soup is great. One of my favorite restaurants makes a hearty tomato soup and it is served with basil puree on top.

Basil puree saves the day!  My kids were disappointed because I had no parmesan or nuts to make pesto, but then, I found this!  We made it to fit the amount of basil I had (probably less than this recipe intended), and it was a great sauce for our home made spinach noodles!  A little goes a long way for flavour, so it fed the whole family!

I added black pepper, red pepper and fresh garlic then blended everything. Great sauce that works well as a dressing when blended.

I got a very large bunch of organic basil at work and didn't know what to do with so much.  Ended up trying this recipe and freezing it in several small servings.  For a quick dinner one night, I cooked a stir fry and remembered I had these.  Add one serving and it made the dish.  Very tasty.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It is very good and a great way to use basil very quickly! It took me about 7 minutes and then added some to my dinner! I will definitely make again!
