I like to make this pizza with a refrigerated crescent roll crust. I just spray my cooking sheet with a little Pam, roll it out and seal the seams and pre-bake for 12-14 minutes or until brown. It tastes better than a packaged box crust (that's our family's opinion, I don't speak for anyone else). I also prefer to use a homemade barbeque sauce. My husband and kids will literally eat the whole pizza in 15 minutes. This is a great way to use leftover roast chicken or even crockpot pulled pork.

Great recipe.  Didn't add green or red pepper and used a refrigerated pizza dough.  Really a foolproof recipe.  Thank you!

Quick, easy, and delicious - perfect for a weeknight meal! Plus, it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken. And to think all I had to do was sautee some onions and peppers. I used red onion added a little yellow pepper for a little more color and sauteed everything with a little minced garlic for a flavor boost. I used a thin crust Boboli bread shell and some KC Masterpiece bbq sauce. I also used a Mexican blend cheese but I'm sure any cheese would do as long as it gets nice and bubbly!

YUM!  I made my own pizza crust because I am not a fan of mixes.
I didn't expect to like this nearly as much as I did.  Just writing this review is making my mouth water!
I will make this again and again!

This is a great and simple BBQ Chicken pizza, I don't think it would be nearly as tasty without a home made pizza crust (I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust). I diced my red and green bell pepper instead of julienne slicing (my son isn't a fan, and if they're in smaller pieces he doesn't seem to notice them much). We used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce and followed the directions and ingredents. It was very tasty and easy! I boiled and shredded my chicken and diced the veggies and sauteed them while my pizza dough was rising and it worked out well.

We love this recipe. I used it this time with this whole wheat dough recipe and it turned out pretty well.  I did bake it at 350 (did the dough for 10 minutes first) and then the topics at the same temp. for 15 minutes, but it probably could've been longer. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, cumin, salt & pepper and cut them into strips instead of shredding.

This is a great simple pizza. I made a couple minor changes - Once the chicken is half-cooked while frying, I'll throw in the onion and peppers and fry them all together for the last few minutes. This helps make the chicken more flavourful. I also spice the chicken with a bit of fajita seasoning or just some salt and pepper will work. I use Bullseye Original BBQ sauce. For the cheese, I used a combination of (all low fat) Monterey, Mozzarella and Cheddar. Pizza came out great! Next time I'll probably add some tomatos and try out a different BBQ sauce like Chipotle or smokey, perhaps throw some fried mushrooms in the mix as well.

I've never really done too much cooking before and I thought I'd give the recipe a try.  It turned out great even after an embarrassing rookie mistake:  apparently there is quite a bit of difference between green peppers and jalapenos as well as a difference between red peppers and chilies!  Nevertheless it still tasted great...just with a bit more of a kick!

Darn good pizza! I used the "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" recipe for the crust, but next time I think I`ll opt for a thin crust. I seasoned the chicken with some remaining herbs from the pizza crust recipe (a dash each of basil, oregano, and onion powder) as well as 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 3/4 tsp cumin. I then saut√©ed with 3 cloves of minced garlic. Definitely gonna use this recipe to impress my friends when they come over!

Didn't use any red pepper, just green.  Seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little cumin.  Used Premium Pizza Crust recipe from this site.  Very good.

I do this with a twist because we only like thin crust pizza. I brown a flour torilla shell on both sides then add cooked chicken, onions and mozarrella, then put in oven at 400 degrees for about 13 to 15 minutes. Perfect for individual pizzas when you use the medium size tortillas and can add extras to whoever wants more stuff on theirs. Makes great thin, crispy crust pizza and less fattening.

This was great. I'm in the habit of buying bulk chicken breast when it goes on sale and I always poach, shred and freeze some of it in small portions. That made this recipe really quick! I also cheated and bought a Boboli crust. If you like those, then it works great. A yummy dinner in 20 minutes!

Love this recipe... especially the boxed pizza crust.. way better than pre-made crusts. Love cheddar cheese. The only thing I changed was the sauce. I like 1/2 pizza sauce & 1/2 barbecue sauce... it makes it a little milder. Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious.. I just changed a couple small things. I sauteed one chicken breast with red, yellow, and orange sweet peppers (no green pepper on hand) and half a yellow onion. I added Trader Joe's bbq sauce (delicious, with a kick!) to the mixture while it cooked. I also used bobboli pizza crust (but Im sure pizza crust mix is better) and then baked it for about 15 mins. For cheese, I used a mozz, jack, and cheddar mix.. Anyway, it was sooo good and I will DEFINITELY do this again!

I had made Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue and wanted to make pizza with the leftovers, so I chose this recipe.  While I did not measure ingredients, I did use everything listed except the oil.  I cooked the onion and peppers in a teflon coated pan sprayed with Pam. I just spread a thin layer of Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce on the pizza dough since the chicken had already been cooked in bbq sauce.  I was surprised at how much I liked this recipe.  Definitely a keeper. ***Update 4-24-13 - I used pepper jack cheese and that took this over the top! Made it a 10!

This was not a five star recipe although easy and good in a pinch.  I made this exactly as directed and it was just ok.  It does not live up to other highly rated recipes on this website.

I think my husband said about 5 times how awesome this pizza was!  I made a few changes...I made the crust from scratch since I didn't have a any premix and pressed into a 9 X 13 inch pan.  I used prepared fajita chicken strips in a bag and cooked that on stove with the onion and peppers. I added 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning and salt and pepper also. Then I used Monterey Jack cheese instead.  Will add black olives next time also.  Will definately make this again!  Thanks for recipe!

Made this for supper last night using blackened chicken, all it all it was a delicious recipe, I think that I will make some changes next time though. I will use a savorier bbq sauce and go light on it, use a cajun pizza crust and add some red pepper (spicy) and sweet onions. The boys liked it only complaint too much sauce lol.

I am newly married (and learning how to cook) and my husband loved this!  The thought of BBQ Chicken Pizza sounded very repulsing to me, but it turned out to be very good. The pizza dough was kind of a pain to work with so next time I think I will try rolling out cressent roll dough instead.  But over all it was pretty good and pretty easy to make.  its a keeper.
