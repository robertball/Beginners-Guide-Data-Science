Delicious dish.. the higher milk to egg ratio made this very creamy rather than firm and I liked that a lot.  I cut back on the cheese a bit as well.   Right now the recipe show 1/2 CUP of dry mustard when the personal recipe shows 1/2 tsp.. Please dont use 1/2 cup of dry mustard...that would be a disaster

I made this recipe and liked it except for the cornflake topping.  we ended up scraping off the corn flakes and the rest was good.
