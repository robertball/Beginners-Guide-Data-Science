This recipe is good but missing a cooking temperature. I cooked at 375 F for the times suggested and it came out well. I added finely chopped walnuts to the filling and raisins to the topping since they are just necessary parts of sticky buns for me. If I try this again I think I will skip the stove top part and just mix the topping together including raisins and put it in the bottom of the pan layering the buns in and then Baking for 45mins and flipping them out like a traditional sticky or cinnamon bun. Overall it was good though!
