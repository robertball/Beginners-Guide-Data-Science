So easy and good! Perfect for a last minute dessert. I didn't have self rising flour so I added baking powder and salt. I also added cinnamon since we all like it. It was delicious. My family will be wanting me to make this one often.

I halved the recipe, except for the sugar, using 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown.  I also used 4 of the single serving peach cups instead of canned fruit.  added a good bit of vanilla and cinnamon to crust mix.  also sprinkled the tops of the peaches with brown sugar and cinnamon.  Baked for 40 min. in a 8x8 glass dish. This came out soooo good, no problems with raw center as others mentioned.  This is the recipe I will use for peach cobbler from now on!  So easy and quick and good! YUMMY!! Thanks so much!

This was great! We adjusted the recipe to serve 12 and cooked it in a 9x13 for 35 minutes. Then covered it with foil to prevent overbrowning and baked another 10 minutes. We also used fresh peaches ~6 cups (3 lbs) tossed with 1/4 cup or so of sugar. 

Bake in 9 x 13

I am basing my review off of my mom`s recipe. The recipes are very similar. The only difference is that she uses regular flour (add 2 t of baking powder) and the sugar is only 3/4 a cup of white sugar if using canned peaches.

For fresh soak in an added 3/4 c of white sugar. Also, she adds 1/4 t of salt. I use 1 t of vanilla extract and for the milk half the 3/4 c is half and half and the other half is whipping cream. I have always baked it in a an 8x8 dish (CLEAR GLASS for fruits always) and never ended up with a soggy cobbler.

I used 9 ripe freshly cooked peaches and juice for this recipe (9 peaches, 3/4 cup of peach juice, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, 3/4 cup sugar and 1/8 tsp cornstarch cook over Medium heat until tender. I made alterations to suit my families taste. for batter: 1 cup of self-rising flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup of milk. Hint: Evenly distribute the batter and peaches and juice working from the ouside/in. As even as possibe. Top with cinnomin before baking. I baked at 350 for 1 hour in a 10x10x2in. pyrex dish. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE PEACH COBBLER. Don't roll and weave dough it takes forever and it isn't as good as this recipe. Super Great recipe. 2 thumbs up.

This was really good!  Following some advice I changed the sugar to 3/4c white and 1/4c brown. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla to the "crust" mixture. Instead of one large can of peaches I had 2 smaller ones so I drained one and left the other in the syrup. Baked for about 40 min and it came out wonderfully! I had no problem with sogginess like others said.
**Update**  I've made this twice now and I think "sogginess" is dependent on baking dish size.  First time I did it in a larger dish with absolutely NO sogginess, second time in a smaller dish and the middle was all mushy. And a couple of hand fulls of oats over the top of the peaches really added something great to this!

Quick, easy, and delicious; my three favorite words.I made this once as is, which was totally wonderful. But the second time, for personal preference, I wanted to cut back on the sugar. I used 2/3 cup with half white and half light brown. The peach taste was more dramatic with less sugar, nonetheless, my guests really enjoyed this recipe as is. Easy and excellent. Thanks Fanny.

I was looking for a simple cobbler recipe to feed 450 people this last weekend, and without first trying it, I trusted the ratings on this one and just did it. It was wonderful! One thing to be sure to use unsalted butter.

Overall very good.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla for extra flavor.  Needs to cool at least 30 min before eating, though.

Not accustomed to self-rising flour, I had bought my first 5lbs for another recipe and was in search for other recipes and happened across this one - what a good find!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I used our home-canned peaches and sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the batter.  The first bite to the last was remarkably delicious! Fast & easy - a must try.

I've been making this recipe and receiving complements on it for years.  If using canned fruit, I first use heat and corn starch to thicken the syrup.  Add a pinch of cinnamon and a couple of tbs. of brown sugar to the peach filling. The brown sugar/cinnamon makes the peach filling. extra rich.  For fresh fruit, in a pot and on medium heat add 1/2 to 1 c. of water and 1/2 to 1 c. sugar to fruit (adjust by taste- different fruits will require more-less sugar and adding more-less water).  Bring to boil,  stir until filling thickens a little, and cool before pouring over batter.  Fresh blackberry cobbler is also a winner at my house.

I have been making this recipe for over 50 years.  It is my favorite cobbler recipe.  But slight changes:    1 c. flour, 1 c. sugar, 1 c. milk, 1 tsp baking powder.   I also put fruit in first, then pour this mixture over the top.   Sprinkle sugar over the top.     It is truly great!   Can be made with ANY fruit.  I like it with Blackberries best.   For true Southern flavor, serve with sweet cream poured over the bowl of hot cobbler.

Its nice to see a true southern cobbler.Its simple and easy. This is the way grandma made it..Be careful not to go too heavy on the canned peach syrup or it will be too gooey.I usually double the recipe for a 13x9 glass dish.But I only use the syrup from one can of peaches.

I've made this recipe (with a few small tweaks) several times and I love it. It always turns out perfect and it's so easy to make and cheap. I'm in college and don't have a whole lot of dishes to work with so I really love this recipe because all that gets dirty is the pan I make it in, a small tupperware for mixing, and a measuring cup.

So here's what I tweak: I use both white and brown sugar, and those add up to just a little over a cup. Mostly white sugar, probably about 3/4 of a cup. Then I add a little dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar and flour. A few drops of vanilla extract to the milk, and then I sprinkle more cinnamon and nutmeg over the peaches once I've spooned them over the crust mixture.

This is by far the best peach cobbler I've ever had. Between me, my roommate, and my boyfriend, it's gone in a night or two.

Very tasty, BUT I too, got a soggy mess.  I think next time the peaches should be close to drained (very little syrup) AND maybe 1/2 cup milk.  I knew putting the batter in the dish that it would not puff up and turn cakey - the batter was just too thin.  THen with all the peach syrup on top (even though I held back quite a bit) it was just too soupy.  Great taste though!

This is what I was looking for! It is great, I just had to adjust for the self rising flour since I didn't have any..I used all-purpose and added 1tsp of Baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt. I also used frozen blueberrys after I thawed them and sweetened them with sugar.(just drain some of the juice before adding them to the mixture!  Will Make AGAIN, and again and again...God Bless!

best peach cobbler you'll ever make. There are never any leftovers! Note: instead of milk you can use 3/4 cup of juice from the peaches, use rest of juice with peaches on top. and don't try to double the recipe (I have a large family and double almost everything) but for some reason this doesn't turn out right when doubled. Also works wonderful with cherry pie filling I usually make one of each they both disappear.

Awesome recipe!  After making as-is, I tweaked the 2nd time...I used regular flour and added 1 tsp baking soda.  I also added 1/4 tsp salt, and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also lightly sprinkled the top with brown sugar about halfway through baking...  PERFECTION!

Following advice of others, I baked this in my large casserole dish rather than my 2 qt to avoid a soggy middle and it turned out great!  I also used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  This was so good, I had to keep myself from eating it all!

This cobbler was excellent.  The only changes I made was that I used one cup of milk and flour instead of 3/4 cups.  I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture.  I baked it until the edges were golden brown.  To those reviewers complaining that the cobbler was soggy in the middle, a cobble is supposed to be somewhat soggy with a nice crunch from the edges.  If it wasn't, you'd be having sweet bread with peaches.

Tasty and good. I made a single serving with a peach cup in the microwave. Used a lot less sugar than called for (single serving 2 Tbl. only used 1, next time I will use a lot less. Added a little cinnamon, vanilla extract. Topped it with whipped cream.

Wonderful recipe!  Definately use a larger container to prevent soggy crust.  I can't believe the reviews that change the recipes, then have the nerve to lower the recipe's rating!  And one review said the baking soda made it bitter, when the recipe doesn't even have baking soda in it!  Thank you SLOANF for this recipe!

Very easy to make and great taste.  Modifications I made to the batter:  Add 2 tsp cinnamon,  Add 2 tsp vanilla,  Substituted 1/2 cup Splenda blend (which is 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar) for the 1 cup of sugar  Definitely a keeper and I plan on making it again.

I've made peach cobbler this way for many years,  but have always used    1/2 cup butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup self-rising flour  and 1 large can of peaches (in lite or heavey syrup) and basicly baked it the same way.  My family loves it.  It is good with ice cream.

This was very tasty! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla to the crust mixture. I used two cans of peaches since my cans were a little smaller, so I ended up with less breading, but it was great! We topped it with some vanilla ice cream and enjoyed it.

This was excellent.  I sprinkled sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking, and it was very yummy!  Next time I make it, though, I think I will put less butter than it calls for.

Amazingly good cobbler...and soooooo easy to put together...my only recommendation is to please please please follow the directions and use a deep baking dish or else put a baking sheet under a regular baking dish because this cobbler does bubble...it ended up all over the bottom of my oven!!

Awesome!  I made it on a cold night here in Florida and boy did the warmth stick to your ribs.  The only thing I would add to it would be cinnamon IN the mix before I bake it.  Other than that this is the hands down best recipe for Peach Cobbler!!

this is by far my favorite recipe. I've used it several times. Since I live in CA I either use fresh peaches, or frozen from my moms tree. This is so easy and it's delicious. One note though, I haven't figured out how to store it if we don't eat it all. The crust gets mushy, but I don't usually have that problem!!!  I wanted to add that I made this for a friend's son that is allergic to milk, so I made a really small portion and used soy. It made no difference. It was still delicious and he gobbled it up, enjoying his own personal dessert.

This was an outstanding base to a great peach cobbler.  I followed the advice of other reviews and added vanilla extract to the batter (approx 1tsp).  I then used two 15oz cans of peaches in heavy syrup.  Drained the juice of one and used the whole can of the other.  Before adding the peaches to the dish I added spices to the peaches only.  I also added a tsp of brown sugar in addition to the white sugar.  It was superb.  I had to make twice in two days because everybody did not get some.  It disappeared overnight.  Good thing this is a cinch to make.

This recipe turned out very soupy.  There was so much juice in the peach part that the topping just sunk in and disappeared (it might need some thickening agent).  Also, the baking soda made it taste kind of bitter.  It's too bad--it was for a bunch of guests and I was very embarrassed at how it turned out.

This cobbler was sooo yummy!  I did add 1 tsp cinnamon & 3/4 tsp nutmeg.  My husband is a peach cobbler fan & he said he wouldn't change a thing!  So great because everything you need is already in the kitchen... no special shopping trip needed!  I plan on keeping this recipe on hand... 'specially for when unexpected company drops by!

This was a horrible recipe....maybe I did something wrong...but yuck! The crust got beautiful and golden and yummy looking, but the inside was raw and gooey and gross, even after extra cvooking time! What an embarrassment in front of company.....I followed the recipe exactly. I won't make this again..

I made this with 1 small box of gluten free Bisquick, coconut sugar, Splenda brown sugar (1/2 and 1/2 in Bisquick mixture),substituted almond/ coconut milk (unsweetened) for the milk and Earth Balance butter.
Doubling the recipe as you see, with 6 C of fresh sliced peaches.

I used 1/2 C more of the coconut sugar to create a natural syrup, then tipping it off with approximately 1/2 C Splenda brown sugar mixed with cinnamon to taste.
Baked it for 40 mins at 350.

Peaches came out caramelized and with a thick natural syrup.

Great recipe for an "Eating Clean" alternative for those that are juicing for healthiness!  :-)

I always keep a can of peaches in my pantry so I can whip this up if ever I need a dessert.  So easy and so good. A few tips: Don't melt the butter. Just cut it in cubes and line the bottom of the pan. Also, to address the "soggy mess" issue, I was taught this recipe as the rule of ONE:

1 cube butter, 
1 cup self rising flour, 
1 cup sugar, 
1 cup milk, 
1 (15 OZ) can Peaches, (NOT 29 OZ), 
Cinnamon to taste, (Optional). 

Using 1 cup/cube of everything and 15 vs 29 oz. peaches takes care of the consistency problems. I've also brought it uncooked to a gathering, threw it in the oven when I arrived and we had hot peach cobbler with ice cream just in time for dessert. Yum!

This recipe gets 5 stars for how incredibly simple and easy it is.  All I did was add about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the top before baking. Would be amazing when peaches are in season.  Was a hit!

This was so good and so easy to make! I only had peaches in own juice so I didn't add all of the juice. This may have caused it to be just a little runny.

I had five large nectarines that needed a home.  I tried this recipe with fantastic results. I used 1/2cup regular sugar and 1/2cup brown sugar in the batter. It took 55 minutes to set up and came out delicious. Thanks for sharing this simple delight!

This tastes great, but it turned out greasy. 1/2 cup of butter is entirely too much. Once you scooped it out, you could see butter floating on top of the peaches. 

I made this again and just used 1 tablespoon of butter and I liked the result much better.  I also used 2 cans of peaches and drained them really well so that it wouldn't be soggy.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I followed the directions, but perhaps I did something wrong.  I found it to be very wet and runny!  Also, there wasn't nearly enough "crust".  I like a lot more crust and this was pretty thin.  I'll have to keep looking for a cobbler recipe that I like better.

This is just like my great Grandmother's recipe!  I added just a little more butter, I think it was 2 Tablespoons.  I also added another can of peaches, and baked it in a 9 by 13 inch non-stick pan and baked it fo about 1 hour.  But i love this recipe!!!

I liked this recipe but I did alter it a bit. I omitted the nutmeg. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, I used the peaches in the can with heavy syrup, I did drain some of the juice but not all. I let my mixture simmer for about 45mins in a pot. I poured it in a pan and added the spoonfuls of topping and put it in the oven for about 30 minutes. This was my second time trying a peach cobbler and the first time my family didn't care for at all. This one they loved. They even congratulated me. I will use this again.

This was very good!  I did drain the syrup from the peaches (as recommended from some reviewers) and I baked it in a 9.5inch dish.  It was ready in exactly 40mins.

I think this is a great recipe.  I just made it tonight, cut in half (small family), used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar added nutmeg and cinnamon on top and had to bake 40 minutes, but it came out great.  True there's not much crust, but I don't like much crust and what there was was crispy and delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This is so easy and so, so good (and I'm not even a cobbler fan!).  I've made this several times now at my boyfriend's insistence (everytime he does the shopping he comes home with a can of peaches, just for this).  I only use about half the butter and 3/4 cup of sugar, plus add a dash of vanilla and cinnamon. Definite keeper!

I must admit- I didn't think that this would turn out very well- but I was totally wrong! It turned out great! I took some of the suggestions and cut back on some of the sugar and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar- the taste was wonderful- not too sweet, just right. The only problem that I had was that it didn't really "look" all that great- I belive that I can fix that if I really try to distribute everything evenly and maybe add a little cinnamon or something to the top. Good stuff!

Good dessert in a pinch.  Definitely might have been better with ice cream, but sweet and tasty on its own.

Try sifting the flour and sugar together… It makes it so very airy....and switch the heavy syrup peaches to the light ones...if you're trying to watch your sugar… This was to be up in making it for years…enjoy!!!!!!!!!!

Not bad! Good for a not same chocolate desert. One reviewer doubled using 2 cans peaches but only 1 with juice & 9x13 pan. I did that & it was perfect! I used probably 2 tbsp less butter and put 1 tsp each nutmeg & cinnamon in dry ingredients then 1tsp vanilla in the milk. Only use the self-rising flour, per reviewer and it was perfect! It cooked over an hour and got deep golden/brown.

This was excellent. I changed it just a bit. Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I put 3/4 and I used fresh home grown peaches with a squirt of lemon. I mixed the peaches with the batter in the baking dish, then topped with brown sugar which made it crunchy on top. To die for! OH YEA, I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour. I did not have self rising flour so I put in a tsp of baking soda.

I was looking for a recipe similar to one of my friends whose cobbler I loved.  This appeared to be it so I decided to try it.  It was very easy, as I am not a very good cook, and quite delicious.  Once I made it I could tell something was just a bit different than how my friend makes so I called to find out.  She puts a dash of vanilla extract in with the flour, sugar and milk and tops it with a bit of nutmeg, also she uses peaches in a light syrup.  I would definitely make this again, but with the little differences.

I made this recipe as quoted, and it came out a bit too oily.  I am not sure if 1/2c is too much butter, or if I should drain all syrup from the peaches.  Either way, this peach cobbler was very good served with marionberry ice cream!

I am giving this 4 stars simply because I feel it would be unfair to rate it lower.  My cobbler ended up a soupy mess with crust that was more like a large noodle stuck to the bottom of the pan and a butter/peach soup on top.  That being said it TASTED good.  I followed the instructions to a T and can't determine where I went wrong.  Really wishing mine looked like the picture!

I went a little overboard on the peaches so it didn't rise THRU the peaches quite like it was supposed to but it still tasted great!  Everything's Great with Butter in it! :-) Everyone ate it so it was all good!  9/9/12: i made this again for a group of about 40.  i used the 6 pound can of peaches and tripled the other ingredients.  Made in a large StSteel commercial size pan in my oven.  I cooked at 350 for almost an hour to make sure center was done.  It came out GREAT! everyone ate it all!

THIS is now my peach cobbler recipe. I love cobbler with a pie crust, but this is so easy, AND it's actually more delicious!  I scaled it up for 40 servings and baked it ahead (it takes longer in a bigger dish), taking it out when it was baked but not brown.  Then I browned it during dinner and served it hot.  Four guests argued over who got to lick the pan.  There's no need for ice cream with this stuff.  It's too delicious to hide.

First cobbler I ever made and it's a hit at my house. I have since revised the recipe to all organic products including eliminating the white sugar and adding a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, pinch of kosher salt, cinnamon and nutmeg and I sweeten the organic milk with agave nectar. Still rocks.

This was amazingly easy and tasty! I put my own spin on it by using fresh large yellow peaches, I cooked them down until tender using the syrup from that. I laid fruit first in a 2qt pyrex then batter and topped with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and a slight dash of ginger. Result, A delicious, spiced very very perfect peach cobbler. I will add vanilla to batter mix to try next time,and may add the spices to be mixed with the batter next time. I cooked for about 35-40 minutes and served with vanilla bean ice cream. SOOO easy to make you can't mess this up! Also I followed batter recipe to a T but added evaporated milk instead of fresh, so creamy! Thanks a bunch, will use this batter recipe for all future fruit cobblers!

Doubled the recipe & used my biggest Pyrex dish (4qt)...  had to bake for about 20 minutes longer, but it turned out GREAT!  Used 1 1/2 c white sugar, and 1/2 c brown sugar as suggested.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla to the 'batter' mix, and drained 1/2 the liquid out one of the cans.  I loved using the light syrup - it kept the sweetness level down & went GREAT with the homemade vanilla ice cream that we made for the 4th.  Great recipe & SO easy!

Instead of using peaches, I made this cobbler with 2 cups of fresh sliced strawberries from one of those you-pick farms and sprinkled an extra tablespoon of sugar on top before baking and it was fabulous.  This crust was absolutely delectable!  It's very buttery and the sugar caramelizes on top...yum!

Delicious nothing like a quick simple southern dessert. The reason I gave it four starts is because the recipe as it is is lacking a little something something as the other viewers mentioned. But next time I know it will be 5 stars as I add a little vanilla and cinnamon to the peaches.

I have been looking for a recipe like this one for over 10 years now. I remember this from when I was a kid and now I can make this cobbler for my kids. Loved it. I added a little cinnimon to mine and it came out great.

This was my first peach cobbler and I still can not believe how easy this was, followed the recipe and had no problems. My husband is a fan of peach cobbler and said this was a very good cobbler. Definetly will keep this recipe and will make again.

Very good cobbler, but mine turned out a bit runny. It was still warm when we ate some, but not hot. I only added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter. I used salted butter. I liked the way the top came out crispy chewy. I did have to cook this about 20 min longer than stated and would have given it more but the top was already browned. Maybe it is supposed to be soupy like that at the bottom? It's good otherwise though, nice flavor. Thanks.

This is a good recipe.  I make it often.  It is so easy to prepare.  I add a little almond extract to bring out the flavor of the peaches.  I also cut back on the sugar and butter also.  I prepare every recipe to meet my family's taste.

i found the crust too sweet. and too sticky from the peach syrup. so i ended up using half the sugar the 2nd time and mixed brown and white sugar together. i also mixed this recipe wit a peach crisp recipe. put the crust mixture on the bottom and crisp on top to tasted better the second time. also i advise to add cinnamon.

I was disappointed how the cobbler turned out. I should've drained the juice from the peaches, as the cobbler turned out soupy. I did add cinnamon to the crust. I'm not sure if I would give this another try.

This recipe is 16 years older than dirt.  I got this recipe when I was in girl scouts and my girl scout leader got it from hers and so on....
It is a very good recipe but was meant for cooking outside in a dutch oven.  It is very delicious but for a more spectacular desert try to get a little more creative and use the Old Fashioned recipe listed on this site with the lattice crust.

I've made this 2 times in the past 2 weeks.  I like mine sweet, so I use peaches w/ heavy syrup.  I add vanilla and cinnamon to the crust.  It's so easy to make.  Love it.

Wow! This is a perfectly easy to make comfort food. I made this for a family dinner dessert and everyone loves it. I actually used 1/2 cup of sugar and got the perfect sweetness I prefer. The only complaint I got is some think its a bit salty - I think it's the butter I used. I'll definitely make this again, but I'll be sure to use unsalted butter next time.

Easy, delicious, perfect. I've made this several times and modified it with adding cinnamon and nutmeg or mixing 1 tsp. vanilla into the milk or adding 1/4 cup of oats to this dry mixture. Each modification is still heavenly.

I made this recipe and Old fashion Peach Cobbler for a picnic (read that review)  Took the other one this stayed at home.  Even after cooking it an extra 25 minutes the center would not get done.  Gooey mess and bottom was starting to burn.  Maybe I did something wrong?  My husband ate around the sides and really liked the taste but definitely couldn't take it to the picnic.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I also added the cinnamon and vanilla which gave it a great flavor.  Since my husband and I like the "bread" part a lot, I used 1 1/4 cups of flour and milk respectively.  I only had peaches in heavy syrup, but it tasted great just the same.  I will definitely make this one again!

HEAVENLY....just heavenly. Took maybe 5 min. to throw together (as is). I wasn't sure what a 2 qt. dish was (duh!) so I used one of the square pyrex casserole dishes (about 8 in. square and a good 2.5 inches high); which turned out great because it bubbles up and needs the extra height on the dish. Had I used a pie pan it would have been a huge oven disaster. The end result was that it didn't run over in the over, and cooled to about 1 1/2 inches high. A real keeper !!!

Delicious, but a little too buttery for my taste.  Next time I think I'll cut the butter down to about 5 tbsp.  Very tasty, though!

This dessert tastes like it took a lot of effort, but is actually very easy--and very delicious!  I did make several modifications to the original recipe.  First, I have best results with an 11x7 glass dish.  Instead of all white sugar, I use 3/4 c white and 1/4 c brown sugar.  I add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the dry mixture, and 1 teaspoon vanilla with the milk. I also drain the peaches (this would depend on how moist you like it). Finally, I sprinkle the top with extra cinnamon and nutmeg. It's fantastic with vanilla ice cream!

Made this using Bisquick and it turned out great! I would have normally used peaches but I had some strawberries and blackberries that needed to be used, and it ended up being a great combination. Peach Cobbler still rules though and this recipe is my favorite way to make it - it's the same recipe my Southern grandmother has always used!

I should have followed my instincts and drained most of the juice from the peaches.  I ended up with very soggy cobbler even though I tried to adjust bake time, it just had too much liquid.  I also felt that the butter and sugar could have been reduced somewhat.  Due to the excessive liquid, my cobbler ran over in the oven even though I used a deep baking dish.  I think the flavor is good, but I think adjustments are in order.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, SLOANF!

I had the same problem that a lot of the other reviewers had.  The crust never rose above the peaches.  It stayed gooey.  I even put it back in the oven for an additional 15 minutes....still didn't help.  Not sure why some had success and others didn't.

Thanks! I was looking for a simple, easy, peach cobbler recipe like my Moms, (that I can't find at the moment!) Anyway, I ended up doubling the recipe in an 11x13" glass dish, I also sub. brown sugar for a bit of the white, added a tsp. of vanilla and a bit of cinnamon and it turned out just great!!! It's hard to go wrong with such an easy recipe and it's mouthwatering when eaten with a bit of vanilla icecream! This recipe saved the day, or the dessert!!! :-)

Tasted good but as my husband said, it was missing a layer of crust. I had to bake for over an hour and it was still runny. There was lots of butter with the juice. I added vanilla bean ice cream to the juice and it was good, just not a traditional cobbler.

I did not care for this recipe. It has way too much butter and I LOVE butter. The crust is more like a spongy cake than a crust.

I am giving this 5 stars because this is delicious, and you do not need to change the recipe...maybe less sugar if desired.
I have been using this same recipe since 1970 and turns out every time. I serve it just a tad warm and use real butter.

Love this! You can also substitute cherrys for the peaches. Be careful of all the syrup in the can of peaches, it can make it soupy.

I've been using this recipe for awhile now. I've used the basics of it to create cobbler with apples, pears, and cranberries. It's just the right amount of sweetness! I normally sprinkle the top of mine with cinnamon sugar for an added taste but truly, it is awesome the way it is! Thank you!

I ended up with a really liquidy bottom half even though the dough cooked well and everything.  And I didn't think the canned peaches tasted that great.  They never get tender and soft like fresh ripe peaches.  It was easy and perhaps I didn't cook it long enough, but overall I'd be hesitant to make it again or I might not use all the juice from the can next time.

Easy and delicious recipe! Although leave it to me to screw it up. I picked up the wrong (salty) butter so I had to use the spread I had on hand. Since I used fresh peaches (6) I should've tossed more sugar into them but they just seemed sweet enough naturally.  Once cooked, their natural sweetness was mostly gone.  The cakey crust around the peaches would have been perfect except I believe the spread had something to do with the soggy center. I used a 2 qt deep glass dish, which was a perfect fit for the 6 peaches but 5 would've worked too.  Another important note I'll add is that it's definitely better eatten once cooled; more solid, more sweet, more syruppy, more yummy.  Determined to get it right, gonna try again tommorow, also might try adding cherries to the mix.

I actually followed some of the advice here and added 2tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp vanilla to the crust. I also halved the white sugar and added the other half brown sugar. This is a great recipe. I will definitely make this again. So far the best peach cobbler recipe I have found.

I love this recipe.  You can cut the sugar a bit if you want without much problem.  Once while on vacation, I accidentally bought self-rising corn meal instead of flour.  I used 1/2 self-rising corn meal and half all purpose flour.  It's not the family favorite.  Almost any fruit is good, too.  We often use frozen blueberries or a mix of blueberry and peach.  Very yummy!

Very easy to follow - One suggestion would be to add about 15 minutes to the cook time, it came out a little undercooked the first few times I made it.

I recently made this recipe with fresh peaches.  To add more flavor, I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the sugar and sprinkled about 1/2 cup on the fresh peach slices.  Then I put the remaining spice and sugar mixture into the flour and continued with the recipe.  It was very flavorful.

From some of the negative reviews, I was afraid this would turn out wet/soupy. I didn't have that problem and it looked  good when it was done. However...the batter wasn't crunchy; it was cakey and too sweet even after reducing the sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. It was a simple recipe to try though.  I will keep looking for THE peach cobbler recipe since hubby loves peach cobbler.

This cobbler turned out very good!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 baking dish.  I also only used half of the juice from the peaches.  I added a dash of cinnamon as well, just for a little more flavor.  Overall, very good!

This was awesome!  I increased to 1 c. flour and only had all-purpose, so I added baking powder and salt.  I also didn't have canned peaches, I used 3 fresh peaches, peeled and cubed them and cooked in a little water with some sugar to get them syrupy.  I baked in a 9x5 loaf pan because I didn't have any more appropriate baking dishes for a cobbler, and it still came out very very good!  Just slightly crispy on the sides and top from the butter, which made it soooo great!  This is now my cobbler recipe!

I was wary of making a cobler differently from the way my mom always made them with a biscuit crust on top of the peaches, but this was well worth it. I will definitly make this again and again.

i really liked this recipe...it was good it didnt have a bottom crust and like others said its not crunchy....UNLESS u leave it in the oven a lil longer i left mine in 10 to 15 mins longer then asked also i did sum thing a lil different to my peaches. I put then in a drainer with a bowl under it this done more toward the end of making the cobbler. Once drained i then put 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar along with 1/3 cup cinnamon. then use your hand to mix. Then place then on top of the batter and slightly push them in the batter sprinkle more brown sugar and cinnamon put in the over its soooo yummy my family loves it this way

I made this cobbler in an 8x8 casserole dish and it never rose up through the peaches and juice. I think it would be better to use an 11x7 or 9x13 in. baking dish. I will try it again, this is such a simple recipe and add my own spices. I will post a comment after I do this and will hopefully have a better review of it.

This is a great recipe that needs a few modifications. I made it as is and it took an hour to bake, and even then it was really soggy in some spots. Definitely drain most of the peach juice, and add the peaches first, then the crust mixture on top.

This is really good and exactly what my husband was wanting.  I prefer pie crust cobblers, but hubby likes his peach cobblers like this.  It is quick and simple to make.  I made it with peaches we canned at home so it was especially yummy.  I think I would add a touch of cinnamon next time for another flavor.  Definately a keeper!

This recipe was pretty good.  I made many of the changes suggested by other readers.  It was good, but not great.

Very good!  Very easy!  As long as I keep a can of peaches in the cupboard, we can have dessert anytime.  I would like to tell you how it was leftover, but there wasn't any left when I got up this morning.  Everyone had some after dinner, and then it disappeared overnight!  Thanks a million for sharing this easy delicuous recipe!

Baked for longer than directed and it was still a little runny.  This does taste great though, especially after letting the flavors combine over night.  Wonderful heated up!

really really good and simple.  It doesn't get any easier than this.  I made another from scratch and after all of that work I actually thought this one with the canned peaches was better!  Try it, you will like it.

Ok, here is the lowdown. The taste of this is very good. But, this is a very soggy dish. I had read the reviews so I had drained the peaches but still, too soggy. Next time I will cut the butter in half, I might add a bit more flour also. I sprinkled cinnamon over top of the peaches. I will make this again but will cut down on butter and bake a tad bit longer. Oh, I used an 8 inch glass square dish and this was a good size. This is quick and easy and very yummy! Happy Baking!

Fabulous! Family and company loved it.  I also went with the suggestion of adding some cinnamon, it really enhances the flavor.  They are already asking me to make again. Yay!

Very good.  I would have liked more of the cobbler.  The texture was good.  I used lite peaches, but I think the heavy syrup would have been better.

This recipe is so simple and so good. I can make it all the time because I always have the ingredients in my home. Like some of the other people have stated, I also add 1 tsp of cinnanmon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla for more flavor. Its great!

Excellent.  I made it for my mother and her friend (who makes her  own awesome peach cobbler) and it was gone before the night was over.  They loved it!! :) Thanks for sharing.

I have tried this recipe a few times, I absolutely love it, the second time I made it with less sugar and more peaches. I also added a little vanilla and some cinnamon.

This is the second time that I have made this peach cobbler, and I am just hoping that there is enough of it left over for me to really enjoy it. My family only left me a small corner the first time I made it, so I am giving it 5 stars because I have some really picky eaters in my household. My hubby said that it was just as good if not better than his mother's peach cobbler, so that in and of itself is worth giving this recipe a try. I did add about 1/4 of a teaspoon and a dash of nutmeg to my recipe. I also used 1/2 cup of regular granulated sugar, and 1/2 cup of Splenda.

I used this years ago before they deleted my old account. :( This is quick an delicious. I used peaches in heavy syrup and poured a little of syrup in to have some liquids in it. I probably used 1/4-1/2 of the juice. I will remake and add a current photo.

This.is.the.best.dessert.ever.  I just had some, heated a  little in the microwave, with whipped creme on top.  Comfort food yet an elegant dessert.  Two tweaks are necessary. 1) Double the recipe. As written will not be enough.  2) Use 1 can drained peaches + 1 can in with syrup (I used heavy.)  I promised my son I'd make peach cobbler, got started and realized I was nearly out of flour and sugar.  Using what I had, I topped off the measurements with baking powder, salt, cornmeal and Splenda and it is sooooo good!  Can't rate this one high enough.  I'll be making it again for our Pack's Blue and Gold.

Very easy to make and tasted good. I followed the recipe exactly since I haven't made peach cobbler in years. For some reason, mine took about an hour to cook! My oven usually cooks fast, so I'm not sure why. Still came out good though.

Do not try this recipe without self-rising flour. I only had all-purpose flour on hand so I tried it but the dough stays at the bottom and will not rise. It had wonderful flavor which is why I gave it 4 stars even though mine didn't turn out right. I will try making it again with self-rising flour :-)

Based on taste, this was amazing.  But I followed the directions exactly (except adding cinammon) and I too got soupy results.  It was more like a hot topping to make a sundae.  Not sure, but it seemed like too much butter and maybe too much syrup? Will experiment again with it because it tasted great and my guests loved it!

Very good but I had to cut back on the milk a bit or it would have been soupy like others mentioned. I used fresh peaches (5 small) which required more sugar to be sweet, I added half a cup more sugar and could have added more. Also I added cinnamon which made it great! With these changes it was a big hit and will make it again!

It is simple and inexpensive. It is great because it has a tang to it from the peaches, but it is not too sweet.

Thank you for using the 29 ounce can of sliced peaches as that is what I had in my pantry except my can had heavy syrup.  The cobbler was absolutely great and my husband enjoys a great peach cobbler!  I  made a few changes based on other reviews.  I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.

I followed the recipe completely and I loved it. My husband didnt like how it was moist on the bottom of the crust where the peaches are, but I thought that was the way it was supposed to be, especially since the peaches did have syrup.

This was really, really tasty.  Does it really need that much butter, though?  It was swimming in it.  Next time I will try 1/2 stick of butter instead (1/4 cup).  Delicious with brown and white sugar combo and a little Mexican vanilla.

Good base recipe. I added cinnamon and nutmeg for something extra. I made the mistake of not adding enough juice from peaches and ended up peach sweet bread. Very good though.

I followed this recipe exactly adding cinnamon/brown sugar mix to the top to add a light crunch. It was delicious!! I make it all the time. Especially for Thanksgiving!

It was pretty tasty and the family loved it.  They always say a cook/baker's worst critic is themselves and that stood true for me on this particular recipe.  Next time I'll use a smaller pan and add less peaches.

I've read several of the reviews for this recipe. Although it was pretty good, I'd rate it more like a 3. It reminded me of canned peaches - perhaps because you pre-bake the peaches first.  I prefer mine peaches a bit on the fresh-side, not so soggy and mushy. I used fresh, ripe peaches from my No. Cal. peach tree. I'll try another recipe next time.

Mine looks nothing like this picture!  The only modifications I made were:  Drained the peaches and mixed them with 1tbs of cinnamon and vanilla, dash of nutmeg, and I used 1% milk since that was all I had.  I baked it for an hour in an 8x8 glass dish and it is sopping wet.  Any longer would've resulted in a very burnt crust.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but this was quite unsuccessful and disappointing...

This is a great recipe.  I did add cinnamon and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I have to make it all of the time now for my family, though they have requested cherry, blueberry, and every other fruit imaginable.  I have tried to double the recipe and it doesn't quite turn out the same as the original.  This is a family favorite!!!

uhhh... WOWZERS! I'm from TX and down here we're picky about peach cobbler. This was easy to make and came out delicious! Could use some fresh sliced peaches in there but all in all was awesome! Plus, I supervised while my 7 y/o literally made the entire thing on her own.

This cobbler was really easy to make and was super-good! I made it to take to a family reunion and everyone loved it! It disappeared very quickly! The only modification I made was that I used one 15 oz can of peaches in heavy syrup then added about 5 fresh sliced peaches - it was perfect! I made it again the next day for just my family and once again, it was gone in a flash! Great recipe - definitely will make this again and again.

Other than using just about half the syrup, I followed the recipe to a 't'.  After the baking time there was this big puddle of liquid in the middle of the dish.  I took the dish out and actually poured the liquid (juice or butter?) out.  Then baked another 15 mins.  When it came out, the center was still all wet and the batter part was never cooked through.  Only reason I gave this a 2 star was because the edge of the dish did get cooked thoroughly so I was able to taste that area, and that was ok.  I won't be making this again.

I should have listened when another person said there is no crust.  I don't know what the flour milk mixture is suppose to be, but it's not a crust at all.  The taste is not so bad, but not for me, sorry.

I left the sugar as is for the recipe because I like things sweet, and because I wanted to try the original before altering.  That said, there is WAY TOO MUCH sugar in this recipe!  Also, I had to cook for longer than the recipe said (just about an hour) to let the bready part rise up and crust over.  That might be my fault though.  I mixed the flour mixture in advance and refrigerated it so it could travel to a friends and be assembled easily there.  It's probably that that upset something in the self-rising flour.  I will try this again, with a fraction of the sugar.  It was yummy, just unbearably sweet.

I really was hoping this would turn out. The picture looked great, just what I wanted mine to look like. But mine did not turn out too great. I followed the directions to the T. I did feel like adding the syrup or at least all of it was going to be too much and i was right. My dough never rose to the top. When it was done I had to shovel through the goop and get the dough from the bottom of the dish and place it on top. Then i baked it for another 45 min and we ate it after that. The dough was cooked but a weird syrup this texture. The mixture was nice though and dh did like it. so its ok but I wont try it again, Unless I really modify it.

This was my first cobbler ever and I made it for my fiance and I. It turned out to be sooo fabulous! He loved it and so did I! I didn't have any nutmeg and I wasn't sure what to substitute it with so I just added a little more cinnomon. It worked out ok. Again, this is awesome!!

Awesome!!!!! I perfect this every time I make it! For more taste, I add 2 tsp vanilla to the sugar and self rising flour and before the dish goes in the oven I add a little more vanilla to the top as well as cinamon. Again...a hit every time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is delicious and easy. It has become a standard for parties when I don't have a lot of time to bake a dessert. I hate canned fruit, so I like to substitute a mix of fresh or frozen peaches and blackberries (simmered for about 20 minutes with a tablespoon of honey, 1/4 cup water and a sprig of fresh mint. Yum!

This cobbler was ok.  I do not think it needed so much cinnamon, and it was a little sweet.   Probably would have been better without sprinkling it with sugar and cinnamon.

Worked beautifully. Increased recipe to serve 30. I did have to bake it longer than suggested so it would brown. I even broiled it a while. Very

Hmmm, what's missing? It sooo easy, that's its most favorable attribute.  The final result isn't outstanding, but not bad either.  It's a bit too soggy for my liking. I'd like more crust.  This crust was quite buttery as well.  Again, not bad, but it needs a bit of doctoring up.

This is kind of gooey and I would probably not make it again...it just doesn't do anything for me.  I am only rating it so high because my husband loves it and says it is his new favorite dessert.  So...since it is easy and we always have peaches at home I guess I will make it occasionally.

WOW! WOW! WOW! This is the best peach cobbler I have ever tasted. I was on the lil uneasy side because it was so easy to make but the end result was the best. Thank you very much.

No, no, no.  I don't know what happened, but something went very wrong for us when we made this.  It didn't become crispy or cakey, it became what I can only describe as.... chewy?  I will not be making this again.

Made this recipe yesterday and turned out great!!  However,  I was a bit hesitant to add all the peach syrup in but,  would’ve been better if I did.  I also sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top which was good for this Thanksgiving holiday but, not necessary for everyday or a summer meal.

DON'T ADD THE LIQUID off the peaches!!! I added the peaches with the liquid as the recipe called and after almost an hour of baking, it still was not set up. I quickly mixed up a 2nd batch and this time left the liquid off by draining the peaches first, and it turned out fine.

I did not have self-rising flour, so baking powder and salt added did the trick. I used 2 large cans of peaches, with the juice from only one can. I also added one-half more for the other ingredients to make a larger cobbler. A sprinkle of cinnamon on top before cooking added nice color. Adding 10 minutes to the baking time was perfect. Delicious!

I added just a little cinnamon and vanilla to the batter.  The flavor of the cobbler was good, but it was just way too gooey.   The liquid from the peaches needs to be mostly drained.

Wow, this is great!  I took other's advice and used regular flour with 1 tsp baking powder.  Also used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c light brown sugar, adding a few drops of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon & nutmeg.  I also used fresh peaches (2 large) and the juice from a can of fruit cocktail since I was unsure what to use in the place of canned syrup.   I put in the fruit first, then poured the mixture over.  Just the right amount of softness inside with firm crust.  Served ala mode - amazing.  I'm getting ready to make this again and will experiment without the canned syrup this time.  Great simple recipe!

I doubled recipe but added 5 -15 oz. cans of peaches in light syrup minus one full can of juice and sprinkled cinnamon on peaches. It was wonderful. I have made this twice within 4 days. Everyone loves it and I love it because it is so easy. I used 4 qt. glass dish and it cooked for 50 min. give or take. Tks

It was just okay.  I did overcook it some, but I think that I overcooked it because I didn't drain the syrup and had trouble judging if it was done or not.  If I make this again, I'm definitely going to drain the peaches some.

I tried it with skim milk and added cinnamon. It spilled over in the oven in a 2 quart baking dish. Next time I'll use a 9X13 dish. Also, I'm going to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and add 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

I've made this several times and its very good. I did have trouble with it getting too browned cooking it at 425 for 30 minutes so I just keep a close eye on it at the end. I took it to a picnic here in SC and was told it was the best peach cobbler they've had :)

This was good but my crust did not rise either.  Thought I had too much liquid in the canned peaches but after reading the reviews I don't think that would have helped.  However it did get eaten at my house!  I just prefer a cobbler with a little more crust.

I just took this out of the oven. It looks beautiful other than a little liquidy.  I will let you know when it cools down how I liked it.

Prepared exactly as the recipe calls for, you do end up with an uncooked center. On the other hand, the taste is out of this world- so I will try this in other ways as suggested by reviewers.  The taste is too good to give up, it just needs to bake all the way through.

The flavor was ok, but, like several other reviewers, it was kind of gooey. The top was cooked, and cobbler-esque, but a lot of the batter stayer around the peaches and didn't cook. I used the peaches in a plastic jar instead of a can, is it possible there was more syrup in those?  I think I'll try it again with more peaches and less syrup and see how it works.

The cobbler did not turn out anything like the picture. The batter did not rise, and turned into a lumpy, gooey, pasty mess. My children refused to eat it, and my husband's first experience with peach cobbler was not the greatest.

Num, Num, Num...this was a wonderful piece of heaven.  I enjoyed it but thought that it was missing something; I can't figure out what exactly it is missing.  I am going to give it another try, only I'll add a few things to figure out the missing ingredient.
