I made these around the Holiday's and they were a big hit.  My Husband ate them up before I could get my hands on a second one.  I substituted the OJ for orange liquer since I had it on hand and next time I will use more and reduce the water.  The mixture came together rather easily and I felt a bit less guilt knowing I used milk rather than cream as in most scone recipes. A definite keeper!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have used it many times, with many substitutes.

Whenever I make it with substitutes (cranberry walnut, choc. chips, cinnamon raisin, etc.) I leave the currants and orange juice out of the recipe, and add what I want (and maybe a bit more sugar if necessary) and everything turns out great.

The consistency of the dough ball isn't always the same, but the scones always turn out great.  Oh, and I never grind the oats, and it seems to be just as well.  Thank you, jessica!

for those who cannot eat wheat, I alternated with some flax seed and rice flour and they still turned out well.

I used whole wheat flour instead of the white flour, and honey in place of the sugar.  These are light and tasty!  I also added some cinnamon, which meant that they smelled good, too!

I made these for the first time the morning of a church bake sale.  The scones were a hit and all of them sold.  Being mindful of other reviewers' comments about the stickiness of the dough, I added a little less milk than called for and the resulting dough was easy enough to work with.  I used 1/2 sweetened, dried cranberries and 1/2 chopped dried apricots instead of currents and used a wonderful whole cane sugar instead of white sugar.  I also added a capful of orange extract and I used salted butter because it was what I had on hand and besides I like the flavor of a little salt in my baked goods.  I cut them in slightly smaller scones and baked them for 15 minutes.  I tend to like my scones on the less sweet side and I liked these, but they probably would have still been fine with another tablespoon of sugar.  They were a tad dry, but maybe wouldn't have been if I'd used all the milk called for.  Overall, a good recipe that I will use again.

I has never baked scones before and started with this recipe..everyone in my family loved it. I did not get it into a good dough consistency but I just took the sticky mixture, made random shapes and baked it...turned out delicious :)

These were very delicious. I thought they were tender and I loved the pre-plumped fruit! I halved the recipe and used small cookie cutters. I also made the liqueur substitution. I didn't have currants so I used dried cherries instead and because I didn't have dairy milk I used soymilk which didn't change flavor or texture.

Added 2tsp. orange zest and substituted 1c. of the flour with white wheat flour. The scones were a little bit dry, but were nice and flaky and quite delicious with a bit of jam.

Great if made with sweetened cranberries instead of currants.  I'd suggest going a little lighter on the oats and a bit heavier on the flour to make them a bit less crumbly.

This is a reliable and delicious recipe. I add chopped nuts and orange rind and I have sprinkled granulated sugar on top. I make the scone smaller than 1/16th of the dough - and I roll them relatively thin - but not too thin. I always use dried cranberries, and will try blueberries one of these days since I am from Maine! This is a delightful scone - not too sweet.

These were super dry and boring. I used chocolate chips instead of the OJ/water/currant combination because another reviewer said she just switched out that ingredient easily, but the end result was pretty tasteless. I gave it two stars instead of only one because my allergy-ridden son enjoyed them, but he rarely is able to eat desserts, so he doesn't know what a scone is supposed to taste like.

We enjoyed these scones however they were not the best ones we have tried.  I think that I would increase the sugar or use honey when I bake them again because they were not sweet at all.  The dough was quite sticky and I was happy that I made them the night before I was to bake them so that they were able to set up again.  They took 7 minutes longer in my oven but that may have been because I took them out of the fridge just before putting them in the oven.  All in all it was a good basic recipe to build on.

I honestly had no idea what to expect from scones. Despite having jumped the pond twice when I was younger, I never once tasted a scone, but always wanted to. The end result of this recipe was a batch of tender, tasty scones. I did have to modify the recipe, however. Made as stated, the dough would be impossible to form into a ball. It's far too soft, more like a batter. I added enough flour to make a soft dough, then formed it into two balls instead of one. I followed the directions from there, but did have to increase the baking time. If I make these again, I will form the dough into 4 balls and flatten to 3/4 inch or so to make smaller scones. Mine were quite large. They were a hit at work, served up with strawberry jam.

Yum, very tender! I used 2 c whole wheat pastry flour and 1 c white flour for this recipe. I added walnuts. I followed the advice from another reviewer who noted that I don't need to grind the oats. These scones are not very sweet at all, so always include the currants!

These are quite light. Ours came out so sticky that we had to make "drop scones" but they were fine. I think it is better to overbake than underbake as the crispy outside is the best part! If using orange juice, I would also add a little more orange flavor with zest or extract.

Very festive scone recipe!  Simple to make, great texture and flavor.  I added a cinnamon orange frosting that helped make them a wonderful breakfast holiday treat!
