Quite nice.  The cookies are puffy and cake like.  The baking time was dead on when I used heaped teaspoons of the batter, which, as the recipe says, is quite sticky.  I added the zest of one lemon to it as well, and would add more the next time, along with more lemon extract.  I have had so many requests for my variation on this recipe, I can't tell you.  It's a great basic starting place.

These were not my favorite. It's not that it was a *bad* recipe ~ it's just that they didn't live up to all the rave reviews, in my opinion. Yes, they were cake like and the texture was great! They weren't quite has lemony as I had hoped for and they were kinda bland. Even though they weren't my favorite, I'm still glad I tried this recipe. Thanks anyway, Patti! :o)

Very tasty, cakelike cookie.  My cookie scoop made cookies a little too big so I used tea spoons.  A drop the size of a jawbreaker gumball worked best.  The icing is a must but a little extra lemon extract and some yellow food coloring pepped it up nicely.  These were divine with a cup of black coffee.  YUM!

I agree with everybody about how good they are!  However, I have made these several times, and because it is such a wet dough, I added almost 3/4 cup more flour, and refrigerate for one hour, and they are perfect! And oh so delicious!

This cookie is amazing! It has just the right amount of sweetness. I did go a little heavy on the lemon extract after reading some reviews. To make it even lower in calories I used egg substitute, 1% milk and cut the glaze in half. With these changes, it is only 72 calories per cookie. I didn't use shortening either I used unsalted butter (had to be a little bad)

Really yummy cookies!  I loved them -- perfect for giving away on Christmas cookie platters.  I also really liked how easy the recipe was.  The cookies taste like something my grandmother would make, but were much easier!  Note: These cookies taste equally as delicious with orange extract in the dough and icing.  Also, make sure to use the parchment paper called for when baking the cookies.  Without it the cookies tend to brown too much on the bottom.

These turned out perfectly.  First of all, though, I wouldn't call them "balls"- they are more cookie-shaped with a cake-like consistency.  I added more lemon extract to the batter; just taste the batter as you add to get to where you want.  I also added a bit more extract to the icing, and more water as well- 1 spoon at a time until I got the desired consistency.  I put a few drops of yellow food coloring into the icing too so they screamed LEMON. Big success.

What a yummy "cookie". Its definitely cake-like not the consistency of a cookie. I did follow the recommendation to add more lemon extract to the cookie mix as well as I added some fresh lemon zest. This kicked the cookie up a notch. For the icing I added some more lemon extract and a bit more powdered sugar so it was more frosting-like and then I added yellow food coloring and garnished with yellow sprinkles.

I am giving these 3 stars, they were okay and a good place to start.  For me a lemon cookie needs more lemon.  I will make these again but instead of lemon extract I will use lemon zest in the dough and lemon juice in the icing.

I love this cookie!!!  It reminds me very much of a cookie that I recall eating at family functions as a child.  The key to the recipe is to make them small.  A level teaspoon works very well.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I added more lemon extract and some zest like other reviewers, and a pinch of extra flour to balance the additional liquid.  As cookies, these were a little TOO cakelike for me, so for my second batch, I spread the batter thin over a parchment paper lined baking sheet, then cooled it and cut in half into two big squares, frosted one half with confectioners sugar frosting (with a drop of both lemon and vanilla extract in it) and lay the other half on top.  Then I sprinkled confect sugar on top to make a pretty pattern and cut them into small bars.  Little lemon cakes!  They got great reviews from my kids.

These cookies are very good. I made them for my mom who loves lemon flavored things. They are not too sweet came out great but I did use the advice of others & added more lemon extract to the dough & icing. Will make them again!

I loved the way this little cake like cookie turned out! I have to admit that I changed the recipe a little, as we are real lemon lovers. I added lemon zest to the batter, as had some other reviewers, and used fresh lemon juice in the icing, in place of water and lemon extract. A small cookie scoop worked out well  and they were done in 11 minutes. I plan to make these often!

I like these cookies they're just not my favorite. My family didn't care for them, I think because of the texture. They come out soft and for lack of a better word, kind of rubbery. The flavor of the cookie is light and a bit bland but the icing is super sweet.

made this recipe yesterday and frosted them today. very tasty, soft, biscuit - cake - like.  I added the rind and juice from one lemon, and doubled the lemon flavoring. I also added a cup extra flour which made these into nice balls. I made the frosting on the thin side with lemon juice and yellow food coloring, then dipped the tops in it. added red and green sugars on top too. this is the best lemon ball recipe I have found and I have been searching for years!

These cookies right here are the best!!  My boss had given me her mother-in-laws recipe, and I lost it.  I followed the recipe with just a slight change.  I added 3 to 4 extra teaspoons of lemon extract to the dough & to the icing as well - that's if your a lemon lover as we are.  This recipe is AWESOME! (Allrecipes should extend the stars on the reviews of recipes, because I would definitely give this recipe 10 stars!!  TIP: You should chill the dough for 20 - 30 mins, it makes it easier to work with when you are rolling your balls & I also use a very small ice cream scooper.  I'm so glad I found this recipe.  Thanks Patti for sharing your recipe and thanks allrecipes for a wonderful site to be used by millions of food lovers!

Amazing recipe!  If you love lemon, you will love these cookies.  The cake-like consistency is great, and I especially love the lemon icing.  I gave these cookies out for the holidays, and everyone loves them!

I served these Christmas day at a party and without exception all 35 people loved them.  Most people remarked that they tasted like a bite of lemon meringue pie.  I followed the recipe exactly adding a little more lemon extract to both cookie and frosting.  Next time I would make them a little smaller.  I think next time is already here.  I had many requests for this recipe.

I'm not a big fan of cake-like cookies like these are. I was also disappointed because they spread a little too much. They have a nice lemon flavor though. Sorry, I will not be making these again.

Great cookie! - Found that the cookies stuck to the parchment paper - so I greased a cookie sheet. Also, bake time was more in the 13-15 minute range.
