I used Splenda/Sugar blend so that diabetic husband could enjoy this too.  I also used lime zest instead of orange simply because it is what I had on hand.  I think a 9x5 pan is entirely too big for this recipe.  It would do better in a smaller loaf pan or possibly mini loaves.  Because of the minimal amount of leavening, it raised very little and therefore was a thin pound cake loaf.  I tasted this while still warm and really only got a sweet citrus flavor, no rosemary.  I did use fresh rosemary.  Uncertain whether I would make this again.
