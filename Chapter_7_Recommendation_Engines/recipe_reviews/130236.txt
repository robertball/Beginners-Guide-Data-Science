I clipped this recipes from USA Weekend which contained an error in the amount of chips.  Even with that fixed, the pudding was too thin in consistency.  I'm not sure if I made a mistake or if there should be more cornstarch.  The flavor was good and I think there is potential, hence the three stars.

I made this with 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup whipping cream and a whole bag of milk chocolate chips.  It is divine!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe if you need a quick chocolate fix. It lacks a little depth compared to other "old fashioned" chocolate pudding recipes, maybe because it has so few ingredients, but it helps to add about a 1/4 tsp of salt, some vanilla, and a little cold butter after it's off the heat. Also, some reviewers said they has trouble getting it to set. The recipe says to bring the cream and starch to a simmer over low heat; typically corn starch needs to simmer for about 60 seconds to thicken properly. If it's not thickening try simmering a little longer. You can tell when it thickens! It happens fast!

This was more of a thick mouse.  We didn't care for the flavor very bitter and had to add some sugar to it just to be able to eat some of it.

Very rich, yummy and easy to make. I added some butterscotch liquior instead of rum as I didn't have any on hand. Next time I would serve with fruit like raspberries to cut through the richness.

This recipe is easy and foolproof.  I found the bittersweet chocolate too bitter for my tastes in this pudding and I am a dark chocolate lover.  Since no additional sugar is added I think semi-sweet is best in this recipe.  I used Bailey's Irish Cream since I didn't have amaretto.  I used regular half and half and cut it with 1% milk so it wouldn't be too rich.  It came out thick and has a great texture but I had to add powdered sugar to sweeten this up.  As is it's a good recipe just use the sweeter chocolate if you like it sweet because otherwise it won't be sweet at all.

I would give this 5 stars except that I scaled it down to 3 servings and there wasn't enough to feed 2 of us!! It was really good and I wanted A LOT more! I'll make the full 12 servings for my family of 4 (one of whom is an infant... I'm nursing so I'll eat her portion!!) VERY very good! Super rich and delicious!

This is half chocolate, no wonder it's so good! Not really a "pudding" treat, more like mousse in that you only ought to eat a tiny serving!

Pudding came out amazing! I used Baileys instead of Amaretto, and full whipping cream instead of half and half. Super delicious.

It had a funky smell/taste and was bitter with a twang. The texture was not like pudding.

I love the taste of this pudding, but mine didn't set well either.  I did exactly as the recipe stated.  My cream was simmering for a good minute or more before I added the chocolate and it seemed to thicken when I was heating it, but never really got there.  I was hoping the refrigerator would help, but it didn't.  I will use this as a sauce over my ice cream!

This turned out lumpy but that was my fault, I was also impatient to try it so I ate some warm; it was ok but I am so glad I left some for latter because then it was a dream! works fine with regular milk.
