This was good! I used Uncle Ben’s Long and Wild Rice and seasoned the chicken well with Montreal Seasoning before sautéing. I did think it needed a little dressing, so I used about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar. Lots of crunch with the almonds, celery, water chestnuts and chow mein noodles. I added the chow mein noodles as a garnish on each serving. I didn’t add sesame oil.

Chow Mein noodles are listed in the ingredients but not in the directions. I did not use the chow Mein noodles. Needs more flavor.
