I was looking for a quick easy recipe for chicken breast and this did not disappoint!  I used 2  1/2 lb chicke teders and doubled the other ingredients.  I only had 1/4 cup of white cooking wine,  so in order to get 1/2 cup, I added 1/4 cup red cooking wine.  It tasted very good, my son who usually only likes meat with BBQ sauce took a second helping.  I made red smashed potatoes as a side, and my husband used the extra sauce as gravy for the potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

WOW!! Followed directions perfectly, nothing was changed and this is a HIT! Just to note: The sauce never thickened for me but it was still soooo delicious, didn't matter! Some reviews said to add lemon juice, but I don't see why. Not needed.

This recipe is excellent! I made it as is and the results were a juicy and tender chicken that was centerpiece on the plate and palate! I served with the Really Simple Rice recipe from this site and it was beyond outstanding. I will definitely make it again good bye dry and chewy chicken breasts!

Followed the recipe as directed. Turned out very well. Will definitely make again. (My husband liked it the way it turned out, but I felt it needed a little more pizzazz, so I took half of a small lemon and squeezed some fresh lemon juice right over it - perfect!)

Yum! I thought this was delicious! I made the sauce ahead of time and used half of it to marinate the chicken and so the flavors could marry together. I also added about a half tablespoon flour to the cooked sauce to thicken it a bit - it just seemed too liquidy. I'm not a fan of dredging many things in flour and while it had a good taste and crispness, I think next time I'll make it without that part. But all in all, it was delicious served with a chicken flavored rice pilaf, corn, and sugar snap peas. Will make again!

I made this recipe as-is and I feel like it lacked flavor. I think adding fresh lemon juice would make it have more flavor.

delicious and tender! I didn't have bouillon cubes so left it out but was excellent. it needed something like maybe onion powder to give it some zing but overall a very nice and easy dish

I added some heavy cream & shredded parmesan to the sauce, put the chicken back in it & let it simmer on low for about 10 minutes... So yummy...

This dish had great flavor! I did save some carbs by dredging the chicken in almond flour instead of white flour. I also added salt and pepper to the sauce and a dash of garlic powder to add more flavor. We will probably make this again; my husband and I both enjoyed it!

Absolutely delicious!!  I had 2 huge chicken breasts so used them instead of 4 smaller ones - It was still more than enough for me and hubby.  Next time I'll make double the sauce because it's sooo good.
I served it with Saffron Rice and Oven Roasted Asparagus, both from this site. It was as close to a gourmet meal as I've ever made.

I halved everything for just 2 of us and should have made the whole recipe for the sauce.  It was tasty but don't expect enough sauce for rice or whatever unless you multiply the recipe.

I'm a vegetarian so the review is based on my boyfriend's response to the dish.  He said that it was amazing and he didn't leave any for my roommate so I figure that's a good sign. I made the dish exactly as instructed. Cheers.

I did not have any bouillon in the house but it was delicious anyway. Will definitely do again.
