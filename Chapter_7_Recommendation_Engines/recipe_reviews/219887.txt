I used reduced fat cream cheese/sour cream, homemade taco seasoning, homemade refried beans and homemade pickled jalapenos. I had some leftover Pace Garlic and Lime Chile Verde which I used in this recipe instead of your usual red salsa. We all loved this dip--it really was one of the best I've made yet. I highly suggest that you make this as early as you can, I made mine pretty early and the morning and lemme tell you, it was pretty freaking amazing.

I made this exactly as outlined for the Superbowl and it was phenomenal! Much better texture than most 7 layer dips and the layer of cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning gave it such great flavor.

This is actually extremely delicious and well worth the effort.  The issues are first, never use lettuce in layered dips because the lettuce wilts and makes the dip unpleasant.  Next, mix the taco seasoning in with the beans instead of the sour cream and cream cheese.  The reason is if the salsa and jalapenos are spicy then the sour cream with cream cheese mixture is the perfect opposite and adding the taco seasoning takes away from the slightly sour taste.  If using chips or pork rinds, slice the tomatoes in thirds otherwise they will be too heavy.  If eating this as a salad of sorts then leave the tomatoes in halves.  I used yellow cherry tomatoes which was the perfect compliment to the sweet red onion and the heat.  You can use whipped cream cheese at room temperature or heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Stirring with a spoon works just as good as a mixer.  Very tasty!

We use this as a main dish! Omit the cream cheese and sour cream, and add the seasoning to the refried beans. We prepare a bed of lettuce on individual plates and top it with the remaining mixture. So, if we don't eat it all, the lettuce doesn't wilt. Had to search for the pickled jalapeno pepper slices, but well worth it. So unique and fresh tasting. Love it!

5 stars for easy for sure.  7 layer dip is one of those dips that is so easy to adapt to what you have on hand.  Black olives are a great addition.  Afraid of jalapenos?  use Ortega green chilies.

I have made this several times and I am surprised that in the reviews nobody mentions heating up the bottom layers first. We love it but what I do is put the beans that is mixed with a taco seasoning in the bottom of a 9 by 13. In a 9 by 13 I used two cans of refried beans. I have also put a pound of browned ground beef with some of the taco seasoning mix on top of the refried beans. I then put the shredded cheese on top of this mixture and put it in the oven for about 20 minutes till the cheese melts. Then take it out of the oven and put on all the other toppings. I use about four or five jalapenos chopped small but I leave out the membranes and seeds so it is not hot at all. I would put the salsa on top first at room temp, and then the other toppings. I also do not use lettuce and I use Roma tomatoes chopped. Of course you scoop out the seeds so it's not goopy.  I then serve it with the very small flour tortillas that they sell that's about 5 in in diameter, and\or tortilla chips. It's great!!.  So I'm not really changing the recipe much but layering it differently and heating it.

Very good! I skipped the beans since I'm not a fan, other then that I followed the recipe exactly. I served it at a small party (10 people) and it was the first thing gone. Definitely going to make it again. Thanks for sharing!!!

Love this.  Made minor adjustments.  Used a cup of guacamole instead of the avocado and skipped the lettuce. 

Layered the guacamole on top of the beans and then the cream cheese mixture on top of that.  Followed with the rest of the layers but skipped the lettuce and added black olives just because I like them.  YUM.

dang, this had so many awesome reviews, but personally it was not a hit in our household of 5 yesterday. I made it exactly as written. I felt the lettuce killed it and maybe I should have used a very chunky salsa as it was just way to runny also

I leave out the lettuce. Shredded iceberg lettuce is sad and weird in a dip. But this is a hit with everyone!

Excellent. I made this for fellow poll workers and it went very fast. I followed the recipe but left jalapenos and lettuce off. I had lettuce to the side but no one used it. Also added sliced olives because I like them. Excellent recipe!

Flavors were great together.  My only problem is that the tomato mixture became quite soupy.  Need to drain it prior to adding it to the layers (just before serving) as this ruined the consistency of the entire product.

Do yourself a favor and stop looking for a better taco dip. This is it! Only thing I did differently is leaving the lettuce off because it would become mushy over time.

Loved it! A bit different than the normal Mexi bean dips out there. I omitted the jalapenos to make it more family-friendly and added olives. Delish!

I am so excited to try this.  I used regular refried Beans and the taco seasoning someone suggested.  Since I love avacadoes, and they were on the small side, I used 3 instead of 2.  Which worked out because I don't think 2 would have covered the entire top of the dish.

I thought this was a great mix from a 7 layer dip I always make. I did cut down on the taco seasoning some, but that was the only change I made. I will def. make this again. Thank You!

Was so embarrassed.  Made and took to a large gathering.  Not many takers or compliments.  This will feed the deer if they will even eat.  Waste of time and money.

I really like the flavor. I added guac as its own layer because the avocados were rocks. It was a very good substitute.  I did not use the lettuce because I knew I would have leftovers. It is great the second day. The next time I make this I will slice the cherry tomatoes into 4 slices. As is they do not stay on the chip very well.  I will make this again.

I make this often for parties and it is always popular.  I omit the lettuce, use guacamole instead of avocados and top with sliced black olives.  It looks and tastes great.  Thanks for this recipe.

Nothing like store bought. The extra effort it takes to make this is well worth it! So many compliments on it when I brought it to a party. The avocado/tomato mixture is so yummy by itself, and the taco seasoning with the cream cheese mixture is a flavorful take on this dip. Yum!

Made a double batch of this exactly as written for a graduation picnic.  Assembled the black beans and cream cheese mixture layers the night before and right before serving added the salsa, cheese, lettuce, and cherry tomato mixture.  Shredded the lettuce the night before and kept in plastic bag with a damp paper towel.  Also made the cherry tomato mixture the night before and stored sealed in fridge (the avocados stayed nice and green as did the lettuce).  
Had lots of compliments on this and will definitely be making again!

It turned out delicious!  I diced the tomatoes instead of cherry. I would’ve given it 5 stars but it was a little watery.  It may have been the pace salsa I used.   I will make again.

Love this! The only thing I change for my children is to use half the taco seasoning and leave out jalapeños and replace with black olives.

THere is never anything left of this appetizer.  It's the best 7 layer dip I've had.
