Easy and delicious! This recipe can be cut in half successfully.  I did let the flavors blend for about 2 hours before serving. I recommend that you take it out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature before serving. This is delicious with potato chips, vegetables and crackers.  You can serve this as a spread instead of a dip as well.
