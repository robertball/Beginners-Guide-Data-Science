Loved these bars so easy to make.  I didn't have the cookie mix so I used refrigerator peanut butter cookie dough and it worked well.  Next time I will try chocolate chips for a twist.

Great recipe!  It was very easy and came together very quickly.  Everyone raved about how tasty these treats are, a big hit with our guests.  I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change a thing.

These turned out really well and look nice when cut into squares. I used butterscotch chips because I only had a few peanut butter chips left. I prefer butterscotch chips anyway and the bars taste delicious for those who don't need chocolate in everthing.

This was very easy and very tasty.  In an effort to cut more time I used a roll of prepared peanut butter cookie dough.  This is the perfect camping food!  Will make again and again!

I tried this with the suggested variation of milk chocolate chips and it was superb!  Took it to a potluck where there was several desserts and mine was definately the crowd favorite.  This one is a keeper.

This was alright. I expected more based on the great reviews. If I would make it again I would cook the peanut butter cookie bottom longer, it was to cake like for me. I took it to a bbq and one person did ask me for the recipe so maybe I will try making it again.

soooooooooooooo goooooooooooood!!!! I made exactly as directed and they are awesome! I don't even really care for peanut butter but made these for my kids and caught myself eating and eating and eating these until I had to push it away! Will make these all the time now for any get-together or function!

Yum! A great homemade version of the popular Pearson's Nut Roll. Perfectly peanut-buttery; a great combination of salty and sweet. This was a great hit at work and with family. Quite rich, super tasty, worth the extra steps. =)
