I would rate this about 3.5 stars. The green and red pepper taste is just so dominant. I even used only about 1/3 of each pepper vs. a whole one. I couldn't find radishes at the 2 grocery stores I went to and finally found the sumac. It can be bought at Whole Foods. I believe this would be best when vegetables are at their freshest in the summer. Definitely consider if raw peppers are a favorite, when making this salad. It made for a quick, easy, and healthy addition to dinner tonight though.

This was a perfect summer salad!  Crispy, brightly flavored, beautiful colors.  I used only a 1/3 c. of green bell pepper because I find the flavor overwhelming and I didn't have any red bell pepper.  I added extra radish for crunchiness. I also didn't have sumac on hand, so I just used a dash of Italian seasoning and a spicy seasoned salt and freshly ground pepper.   Don't make it in advance if you want it to remain crispy.

This was tasty! I knew that I didn't have any red pepper on hand, but I thought for sure I had green pepper.  I went to get my green pepper, and it was not there (who knows?, lol), so I had to omit the peppers (I will add them next time, but reduce the amount,as per the other reviewer).  This had a nice, fresh flavor, which we really enjoyed. I do wish I had the optional olives and feta, tho...just to take it a notch further. All in all, the family liked it. I will make this again (with all the ingredients, lol). Thanks for sharing. :)
