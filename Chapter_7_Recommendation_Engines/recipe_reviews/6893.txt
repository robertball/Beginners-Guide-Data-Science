This bread was delicious but I did have a problem with the top getting too browned before the loaf was finished baking. I tented the top with foil and this seemed to help a bit. Also, I added chocolate chips and we all loved it. Next time I'll try it in a 9x9-inch cake pan.

Awesome combination of flavors, a nice twist on coffee cake. Thanks to the review below I knew to tent foil over it, and it came out perfectly!!!

This recipe is very sweet (especially if you accidentally use sweetend coconut flakes like I did!), but very delicious with a glass of milk.  I reduced the oil by a half, and used half-fat sour cream, and it still came out delicious.

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  You can whip it up in 15-20 minutes, then fill your house with the smells of baking bread and cinnamon!

I loved this bread but did make one change.  I'm rating it a 4 as written because I think the flavour of the cinnamon would be lost by just sprinkling it dry in the middle.

once the batter was finished, I took out about 1/3 and put in a separate bowl.  I added the brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon to this batter and stirred well.  I then poured some of the original batter into the pan, then a few spoonfuls of the cinnamon batter, back to the original batter, until both bowls were empty and in the pan.  I then used a knife to swirl the 2 batters. (as you would a marble cake).   MMMM GOOD!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I made 2 desserts for a holiday dinner I was invited to and really wish I hadn't made this one (for the first time) because it was bland and boring. Still not even sure what purpose the sour cream served because the cake was not moist or delicious. I bake every two days making loafs, cookies, cakes, tarts and pies so it was not user-error. Not sure what needed to be added to make the flavor "pop" but the coconut wasn't apparent and adding more cinnamon would just make it a cinnamon loaf. Not adding this to my list of favs.

I was looking for a simpler recipe to augment my "fancier" Christmas baking repertoire. Well! This one did it - with bells on! The only change I made was to use low-fat sour cream. I got three mini loaves out of the one recipe and brought one to work. My guinea pig co-worker, my favorite taste tester, ate almost an entire loaf by himself!!! He said it was his favorite so far. So especially for him - and me too -I'm giving this simple and delicious loaf top rating. Now I'm going to bake more - and a big one for his Christmas morning breakfast. :-) Thanks!

I used unsweetened coconut that I bought at the co-op, which may have something to do with this recipe getting 4, instead of 5 stars.  This really tasted to me like a slightly coconut-y coffee cake.  It's sweet, moist, and the cinnamon and brown sugar make it very tasty, but I was expecting a lot more coconut flavor.  Should be called "Coconut Coffee Loaf"

I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread turned out perfectly.  It received rave reviews.  For some reason I found the marbling effect a bit difficult to achieve.  I will have to practice next time, as I will definitely be making this bread again.

I also found that I had a problem with the top browning to quicky, though that may have had something to do with me using half yogurt, half sour cream and also half of the oil.  In addition I also found that it was a little to sweet, next time I will try with less sugar and less cinamon. thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I ran out of sugar and so used only 3/4 cup, and it was enough.

I thought this was a great pantry staple recipe.  The bread did make the house smell amazing while baking.  I was pretty aggressive with my swirling so there was nice distribution of  the coconut mixture and the sour cream kept the bread moist

I like it but I don't love it.....I do love the coconut combined with the cinnamon but the topping definitely does not work well on the top and is actually somewhat dry - maybe a few pats of butter mixed into the other ingredients might work better for a topping and the swirling effect just doesn't work with this....I may try to double it....only use cinnamon, coconut mixture in the middle - and see what happens

Very simple and easy to make. I used unsweetened coconut and the amount of sugar called for and didn't think it was too sweet. My dad, doesn't eat sweets at all, he tasted it and liked. Covered the top with foil as soon as it got brown and took the foil off the last 5 minutes of baking.  Loved it! Definitely making it again soon!

I had all of the ingredients to hand except the sour cream, which I substituted for low fat creme fraiche. Followed the directions exactly, plus loosely covered the tin with foil after 10 mins of baking as the top was browning very quickly. My husband, children and guests all enjoyed it very much but the next time I make it (which will be very soon!) I will reduce the amount of white sugar to 1/2 or 3/4 cup as I think it will be just as delicious when a little less sweet.

Excellant bread. I took the advice and used less white sugar, 3/4 C. and had no problem with the top browning too much.

It was ok, but nothing great. Sorta dry and could use an extra punch. I might mess around with the recipe to see what i can do.

I made this and it was excellent. I gave some to some family members and they said the same , it was absolutely delicious. One of the best breads Ive made so far.
