This is my recipe and I hope you like it.  The only thing I would tweak would be the amount of nutmeg.  I would use a pinch.  I use fresh and usually give it a couple of cranks on the grinder.  Also, the cream is optional the soup is just as good without it if you want to watch the calories.  Finally, if you have an immersion blender that is the easiest way to make the soup less chunky.  My kids love this with a grill cheese sandwich and it comes together fast.  I hope you enjoy!

Delicious - WITHOUT the flour and without the sugar. Not only is neither necessary, but I believe the soup is better without them both.  The soup is sweet enough, thick enough, as is. To be on the safe side I erred on the side of caution and used only half the amount of nutmeg called for and was happy with that - certainly better than had I added too much and hated it!  Rather than the canned tomatoes (which would be wonderful too!) I used tomatoes I had put up from my garden. I also added what might be one of the last times I'll get to use fresh chopped parsley and basil from my garden.  Since I scaled this down to two servings I wasn't about to open a carton of heavy cream for a mere two tablespoons, and the half and half I used instead was just fine.  This was brilliant red, intensely tomato-y and incredibly fresh tasting. Along with "Club Sandwich Salad," also from this site, it was a tasty, nutritious and satisfying soup and salad supper.

Beautifully done, SWEETJAM! I love the unexpected nutmeg (I used lots) and the smokiness of the fire-roasted tomatoes. I made a double batch of this because I'm clever. I didn't put the cream in the soup, but lightly whipped it and added it as a garnish - along with fresh basil and bacon. Knocked some socks off! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

Fantastic!  I left out the nutmeg and the sour cream, and pureed the entire mixture.  The result was smooth, creamy, and exactly the kind of tomato soup I've been trying to make for years!  I served this with grilled cheese sandwiches, and every bite was gone in minutes.  Awesome recipe, and so easy.  Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic! I used a whole 6 ounce can of tomato paste and a little more cream, but this was divine! I served this with cheesy bread (a baguette halved and cut into 4ths with butter, garlic powder, and shredded mozzarella in the oven at 425 degrees until browned and bubbly), which would also make good cheese croutons for this soup if you cut it into bite-sized squares. As an FYI, the Muir Glen brand of organic canned fire-roasted tomatoes does not contain BPA in the lining as many other brands do. The acidity of tomatoes causes the thin plastic lining they use in cans to leach BPA, making it one of the strongest sources of leached BPA in foods. So it's good to buy Muir Glen if you can find it, especially if you have little ones at home like I do. :)

For those that are having trouble finding "fire roasted diced tomatoes" I found them in the healthy/organic section of our grocery store. I however went the cheaper route and used zesty diced tomatoes with green chilis. Probably one can of that and one of regular would be good because it was a little spicy, but still good!

I've made this recipe close to a dozen times.  I make it pretty much as is, though I only use 2 tablespoons sugar, leave out the cream, and garnish it with fresh chopped basil.  Everyone who tries it claims it's the best tomato soup they've ever tried.  Using an inexpensive immersion blender is far easier than transferring to a regular blender.  Great recipe, the nutmeg is a must! A big thank you to the recipe creator for sharing!

This was very good.  I didn't like the idea of the cream so I omitted it and it turned out to be a nice, rich tomato soup.  I also omitted the flour, as it thickens up beautifully with the tomato paste and other ingredients.  Very tasty.

This is one of our favorites!  It's as close as I've ever come to my husband's idea of "how Mom used to make it" (it's SO much better than his mom's, but I won't tell if you won't).  I leave out the celery, just because I don't care for it, and have occasionally used condensed milk instead of cream with equally good results.  I also do not puree because we like our soup chunky (and because I don't like washing the food processor).  Making "Just like Mom's" (ha!) tomato bisque tonight as a Father's Day treat for my husband.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I chickened out and didn't add the nutmeg at the last minute. However the soup was so good that I'll trust the recipe's  author and include nutmeg next time. The only other big change I made was using about 1/2 whole milk instead of cream.

Since I found this recipe I have been using it as a base for a couple different dishes and it's been fantastic every time! I used tomatos from the garden to make 1 to 2 cups of fresh sauce instead of tomato paste, it gave extra volume but the taste was still great. I don't care for nutmeg so I never used it, but everyone who's tasted it has been really impressed. Once I added oregano and basil, for that I chopped up zucchini and mixed it with some small cubes of mozzerella (or brick) and cooked ground italian sausage... poured the soup on as a sauce mixed it up a bit and baked it... It's now a family favorite! Also used this recipes to make a yummy chicken tortilla soup... just add chicken, maybe some corn, and used cumin, cayenne and paprika for seasoning... another family favorite!! Thank you for posting this recipe my family has been loving it!

I made this for a soup and sandwich dinner and it was great!  I didn’t have fire roasted tomatoes, so instead I used some Roma tomatoes I’d frozen from last year’s garden.  I decreased the sugar – I would recommend that you add it to taste, and I omitted the nutmeg as I’m not a fan at all.  I used my emersion blender, which really makes this easy.  I planned to freeze the leftovers, so I didn’t add the cream.  Then, when reheating the portion I was serving that night, I forgot to add it!  LOL!  Well, I can tell you that this was still great without the cream.  So, when you’re hungry for tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich, give this a try!

I made changes based on recipes I've had success with in the past. First, I didn't add butter but used olive oil; next, no sugar; then, I halved, seeded and left unpeeled 16 plum tomatoes, sprinkled olive oil over and slow roasted for 2 hours in the oven to concentrate the flavor. Unroasted, the plums have very little sweet flavor, but roasted brings out the starches, which are more abundant than round tomatoes and really develop in the roasting process. I added a little dry sherry (about 2 Tbsps.), and left out the cream. Before serving, I added a dollop of sweet Devonshire cream to each filled bowl. All the spices were right on and I wouldn't have normally used nutmeg, so thanks! It turned out great!

I made this recipe without the cream/milk, used two cans of stewed tomatoes and added extra dried herbs (rosemary, basil, oregano,thyme), and it was wonderful, not to mention healthier! I also used some EVOO in place of the butter. This tasted like the tomato basil soup at Corner Bakery.

It is an excellent recipe. I just preferred to used real tomatoes, left out the nutmeg, only put 3 tsp of white sugar. I also put an extra TBSP of flour. Delicious!

I brought this to a faculty lunch and the teachers all liked it and ate at least one bowl.  After lunch, though, I took the leftovers to my next class and let the students finish it.  They ate it - hey, they are teenagers - but I got several comments that it smelled and tasted like chef boyardee and one girl scrunched up her face and said "it's sweet".  I had thought that it called for too much sugar, so I had even added less sugar.   I liked it but I will cut back even more on the sugar if I make it again.

This came out very nicely. I was concerned about the calories, so I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I think it would have been even better with heavy cream! Next time, to cut down on the calories, I'll use only 2 tablespoons of butter (instead of the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for), but use heavy cream. I also read some reviews that suggested there was no need for flour or sugar, so instead of adding 3 tablespoons, I did 1 tablespoon flour and 1 teaspoon sugar and I think that was enough. 3 tablespoons of sugar would probably make the soup too sweet.

This soup is absolutely amazing! I didn't have to modify it one bit. Everyone at my dinner party positively raved about this soup. I'm so glad I made a double batch - we froze some for a future dinner. Still tasted awesome after frozen.

The second time I made it I put the sauted veggies, tomato products, broth, and seasoning in the slow cooker on high for first hour then low fo 4-5 hours.  Next I used my immersion blender to get the soup to desired consistency then finally stirred in the cream.

Absolutely delicious! We had only 1 can of fire-roasted tomatoes left from our last trip to the States, the other was plain diced. Also, used milk rather than cream. Healthier. Still rich and awesome! Will make as soon as we can get our hands on more fire-roasted tomatoes! Could be a while...

Great recipe! I did not find the fire roasted tomatoes and I'm not sure my wife would like them anyway, but a 28 oz can of petite diced (undrained) worked great. I used half the sugar and also added some sweet basil (~12 small leaves) for our tastes. I tasted it before and after the cream addition and actually like it better without the cream. Panera may have lost a soup customer!

Absolutely delicious.  I added a bit more of each of the veggies.  I also blended the soup very well.  Only a little bit of veggie chunks.  The kids went back for 3rds!!!

I made this soup last night for a dinner party. It was a huge hit! I like a smooth consistency so I simmered the soup for nearly 2 hours to meld everything together and also added one russet potato, again for consistency more than anything (and who doesn't love potato). As a result, I reduced the amount of flour by one tablespoon. I then used the immersion blender to have a smooth, creamy consistency. This was an outstanding recipe and went extremely well with dinner (mustard crusted chicken, steamed broccoli with a gruyere cheese sauce).

This soup had good flavor and I had a craving for this despite the fact that it was 100 degrees outside.  The only problem I had was the flour lumping up when I added the liquids  so I had to blend it all to get rid of them; I was worried that might happen; no one else complained about that and maybe I'm still a little inexpereinced here but I just wonder why it wasn't thickened at the end like most soups.  I used a can of tomato sauce which I simmered a while to thicken since I had no paste... Over all I really loved it and after blending it I chopped up more carrot very fine and let them simmer a few minutes so the soup had some texture.. :)

Great recipe!!  I did make a few changes, due to ingredients I had in the pantry!  I used petite diced tomatoes instead, and half & half.  Also, I had just run out of nutmeg, so I added basil and italian seasoning for the spice.  Served this with some grilled cheese, and it made for a wonderful lunch on a cold fall afternoon!

Fantastic. We had it with a simple salad and it filled us up.  It definitely doesn't need the cream because it is already incredibly creamy on its own.  I added about 2 tsp of salt, and half a tsp of cayenne pepper for a kick.

Wonderfully easy and tasty. I added in one extra celery stalk and carrot. I did simmer a bit longer than specified for good flavoring and used my homemade chicken broth. I didn't add the cream but the husband loved the cream addition. Great soup for the beginning of fall. Served with crusty garlic bread.

I loved this, but my kids were not fans. The only thing I did differently was to add a little can of tomato sauce since I did not have the tomato paste. I did not add the sugar, since the sauce has some in it. Perfect with a grilled cheese, and very easy.

This turned out delicious! I didn't have an immersion blender so I procesed the veggies as fine as I could ahead of time and it turned out perfect. Definitely a keeper! I may try beef broth next time since Hubby is such a big fan of french onion soup. Thanks for the recipe!!

Reminds me of the tomato bisque I had at a restaurant. I made a "healthy" version with olive oil instead of butter and whole milk + some butter instead of heavy cream. Still very good. Am sure the real thing would be even better. It is a little on the sweet side. Next time, I would put less sugar than the 3 tbsp called for.

This recipe is wonderful! I've made it several times and my family and friends are always amazed. I made the recipe exactly as is the first time and it was great. The second and third time, due to lack of proper ingredients, I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg and evaporated milk for the cream. It turned out great. In fact, I think I'll keep the changes.   I love this soup because it's so easy to keep the ingredients on hand. No special trips to the store, just open up your pantry and get cooking!

This is wonderful, perfect for a cold day with a grilled cheese sandwich!  I found that you don't have to have the tomato paste or the cream and it's just as good.  To speed up the cooking time on the veggies I chopped them really fine with my food processer.  YUMM!

This recipe was amazing and i doubled the recipe to feed all 3 of my guy roommates. There are some suggestions though, i made it vegan so no buttermilk, butter, or chicken stock. Instead i chose the healthier route and used vegetable stock and Earth Balance butter (vegetable oil essentially). I also added rosemary, basil, black pepper, sriracha, sea salt, and cayenne pepper because everyone in my house loves it spicy.  I blended the mix to really bring out the flavors of the spices and it came out great the rosemary bread that i made

Terrific tomato soup!  Very simple to make.  I made according to the recipe, except that I was out of tomato paste.  It still tasted great.  My 10 year old daughter helped make it, and she also loved it.  We served with a sprinkle of shredded cheese on top.

I followed the directions to a T - only doubled it - and found it very bland. I guess I'm used to another recipe that has more herbs in it.  Disappointing. Now I need to doctor it up!

This soup was delicious!  I didn’t use the carrots (didn’t have any on hand), flour or sugar. I substituted one can of the fire-roasted tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano diced tomatoes because that’s what I had.  Used immersion blender to gentle blend, leaving some small chunks. We will definitely have this again. Restaurant quality flavor.

Delicious!! This was my first time making tomato bisque; when searching, this recipe sounded the tastiest, and I'm so happy I chose it! As others suggested, I went lower on the sugar. I put in 1 and a half tbs. instead of 3. I'm considering just going with one next time. And, I cut back on the nutmeg; I used 1/8 tsp. and it was enough where you could still taste it. I accidentally picked up stock instead of broth, but that didn't seem to matter. I added about one tbs. extra of tomato paste. Lastly, maybe adding in a little oregano into the mix wouldn't hurt. I topped mine with fresh, shredded parmesan, and oregano. 

All in all, it was excellent! Paired with a grilled cheese sandwich made with cooper cheese, you can't go wrong. I can't wait to make it again!

This was very good! Super easy to put together and made enough to freeze some. I? think next time I’ll cut the sugar in half and use only a couple of tablespoons of cream, though. Overall, a great recipe!

The only thing I changed was nixed the nutmeg and sugar. It was excellent, with a small kick which was very tasty.

I liked this recipe although altered just a couple of things for my taste. When I made this, I doubled the recipe using fresh tomatoes. I omitted the nutmeg. I chose not to add cream opting to add it at serving time if desired. I would definitely use this recipe again.

I've made this several times. It's easy, delicious and healthy. The sugar is important to cut down the acidity of the tomatoes. The nutmeg gives more elevated flavor. If I double it, I use a whole small can of tomato paste instead of wasting some, or measuring out 6 tablespoons. It's just easier.

Turned out great! I added more cream and when served put in sour cream and parmesan and tobasco for some kick. So good, and was the perfect thing to dip fresh bread in!

I followed the recipe but added in extra celery/carrots and served the cream (whipped) on the side.  Using a hand blender was certainly the call for this recipe (very effective & less clean up).  My whole family loved it....including my 12yo who doesn't like tomatoes (he even took leftovers for his school lunch)!

The first time we made this recipe, we made it pretty close to exact, and it was pretty darn good! This time, we added the whole can of tomato paste (I didn't feel like storing the rest of a can), 3/4 cup white wine, and subbed one of the cans of fire roasted tomatoes for a can of chilli style tomatoes (both easily found at Aldi or Trader Joe's). We also reduced the sugar by half and left out the nutmeg, and added just a smidge more cream. It smells HEAVENLY, AND I think it's going to taste DIVINE!

This soup is delicious!  It is our favorite tomato soup.  The only problem is, now when we order tomato soup at a restaurant, we always say "it's not as good as the one we make at home."  This is perfect for dipping grilled cheese and the recipe is versatile.  I usually don't use any onions or celery but add more carrots and garlic, depending on what I have.  Yum!

I made this without changes.  My family liked it a lot, and I will make again.  My only regret is that at the time I didn't have a stick blender, so the texture was a little off.  I know it will be better now that I have one

In lieu of butter, flour and cream, I used coconut oil to saute and the whole can of tomato paste to keep it thick.  The nutmeg  definitely gives this a nice Fall twist.

This was delicious, healthy soup.  I omitted the nutmeg and added fresh basil.  I also used honey instead of sugar. Sooooo delicious!  I noticed that some raters omit the sugar, but I believe the sugar cuts down on the acidity of the tomatoes.  Also, the flour is important so that you have more of a creamy soup and not a brothy soup.  My opinion!

This is good to have on a cold and damp night.  My 2 year old loves this soup and asks for seconds every time!  I make it without the milk because it's creamy enough!  Serves well with homemade wheat bread made into grilled cheese!  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I made this and it is wonderful.  I did change it a bit though.  I used 1 can fire roasted tomatoes and 1 can fire roasted salsa style diced tomatoes.  I also used a half of jar of fire roasted red peppers for add texture and flavor.also add in about 1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves and put everything into the blender to blend smooth. Added croutons made from Crescent rolls fresh sliced basil and little bit of shredded Parmesan cheese on top. It is HEAVEN in a bowl.  enjoy.

I just made this soup and followed the directions as said, except added more carrots, celery and onion.  Also just used 2 TBS of sugar.  This was fabulous.  Cant believe how delicious it was and how fast to make.  A keeper for sure and will make it with grilled cheese sandwiches on a cold winter day.  Thank you so much.  Oh, did not put in the nutmeg......

Made just as instructed. FABULOUS soup!!! Family of 10 thoroughly enjoyed it (we doubled the recipe, of course). I did throw a few garlicky croutons in everyone's bowl for garnish and a tasty treat.  Kudos for a great recipe! And, thanks for sharing it.

My son wasn't feeling well and wanted cream of tomato soup...the canned stuff. I remembered saving this recipe and decided to make it instead so he would be getting something healthy with chicken broth in it. The only modifications I made were 2 tbsp of sugar instead of 3 because I ran out and OMG, it was delicious! My son came downstairs because it smelled so good and then devoured two large bowls!! This was so easy and quick and now a staple in our house. Thank you!

This has become a go-to lunch recipe for us. I usually half the recipe but still use one whole carrot and one entire stalk of celery. Also, I use half butter and half olive oil for cooking the veggies, and I use half and half or heavy cream interchangably depending on what's in the fridge. It's always delicious!

I used olive oil to sauté veggies in first, and decided to only use 1 tbsp flour and 1 1/2 tsp sugar and half & half in place of heavy cream.  Also, I used 1/8 tsp nutmeg because some people commented it was a little strong in the recipe, and added some fresh basil.  It turned out very good and I'm definitely saving this one.

Great texture and flavour!  I tried to omit the sugar, but it really needed it.  Don't add your cream in all at once.  If I'd added and tasted, I would have used a little less for a stronger tomato flavour.

This didn't turn out as good as I had hoped for. I followed the recipe to a T with a few minor exceptions: I replaced about half of the butter with olive oil, I browned the tomato paste in the pot with a little more olive oil before adding the liquids, I only used 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar and finally I didn't add any heavy cream but instead added a teaspoon or so of sour cream to each bowl of the finished product.

My biggest issue was with the mirepoix. I ran all the vegetable thru a chopper until they were a fine mince and cooked them thoroughly and then after boiling I used a slotted spoon to remove some of the diced tomatoes before I took an immersion blender to the finished product. Unfortunately that finished product tasted more like carrot and celery soup than tomato. I know I used what I would consider a pretty normal sized carrot and considerably less than a full stock of celery to start with but obviously that was way too much. For my next attempt I think I'll see if I can find a recipe that omits the carrots & celery altogether.
Overall it was OK but fell far short of what I was hoping for.

Love it! I made it exactly the way the recipe says. I served it with a fresh salad and a hearty bread. My boyfriend of two years said this was the type of meal that makes a man want to marry a woman. Thanks!

This was so delicious! I omitted the heavy cream and used avocado oil instead of butter. My husband loved it! 
You definitely don't need the cream, it's great without it.

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe, used fresh tomatoes (16 Campari, didn't bother peeling, seeding, and I quartered instead of diced because I knew it would all get pureed in the end), a 6oz can of tomato paste, and 3/4 cup of half-and-half cream instead of 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Will definitely make it this way again.

Needed a lot of work. I used a lot of other reviewers suggestions. It was very thin more like a tomato soup rather than a bisque. Kind of bland. After much tweaking, it turned out to be a good soup.

I started out making this precisely by the recipe.  Tasted exactly like Campbell's canned tomato soup.
Added extra garlic, extra salt & pepper, doubled up on the cream.  It needs fresh basil and definitely should be completely pureed.  Sorry, but we were not impressed.

I only made half, but it was so good I should have made the whole amount. I only had pureed tomatoes, and added a drop of liquid smoke for the flavor. Because they were pureed ( and Im a good dicer ) I skipped the blender. I also substituted two lovage leaves ( wild celery)for the chopped celery. I prefer the stronger flavor. Its not too classy, but I couldn't go without cheddar goldfish on top.

Delicious soup, very similar to that sold at Whole Foods. Didn't have a carrot so left it out, used vegetarian "unchicken" boullion and water rather than ck stock, didn't drain the tomatoes, and added 1/2c 2% milk rather than 1/4c cream. Garnished with croutons and fresh basil and served with crusty bread. Fabulous easy weekend lunch on a windy spring day!

Very Very good!!  I made this for several friends and all agreed it was the best tomato soup they have had.  I have made it with the fire roasted diced tomatos and with regular diced tomatos.  It was good both ways but there is a little more flavor with the fire roasted tomatos.

Yummy!  I added a red bell pepper I wanted to use up bit I'm sure it would have been just as tasty without.  We enjoyed this with patty melts made with sausage and mozzarella cheese.  I'm sure we will enjoy again.

This soup was very easy to make, but I would have preferred it with more aromatic herbs.  I added crumbled bleu cheese to each bowl, and it really added a great level of salt with some additional depth of flavor.  Next time I will probably incorporate some peppers for heat and perhaps some cilantro and citrus to give this a little something extra.  Overall this is a very good dish and very easy to prepare.

Finally found a good homemade tomato soup recipe!  Very delicous! I used my own tomatoes from the garden and therefore lessened the amount of chicken broth (my tomatoes were watery)to about 3 cups.  The chicken broth was lower sodium so ended up using a bit more salt and pepper at the end for taste and also threw in some red pepper flakes. I also used evaporated milk because I didn't have any heavy cream on hand. Very yummy.  Will definitely make this again!

Mmm Mmm good? It was better than that! I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while, and am glad I found this one. I don't like tomato soup that comes from a can. And this was really good. I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of one thing. I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground red pepper at the end, for a little bit of heat. Just a personal preference. Either way, this one's a winner! Thanks for posting.

I loved it!  It reminds me of Paradise tomato soup.  Even my 5 yr old liked dipping his grilled cheese into it.  And he never likes ANY soup.

This was FANTASTIC! The only changes I made were to include the juice from the diced tomatoes, I put in a handful of basil in the end, and pureed the entire batch. I also put 1/2 cup of half and half. The results were phenomenal will make again and again!!

Very good soup. I left out the nutmeg because I'm not a fan of that spice, but my family really liked this soup along with a grilled cheese sandwich.

I would've liked for this to be creamier, but otherwise very tasty.  It probably could've benefited from some more seasoning like basil.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a pinch of ground cinnamon as opposed to the nutmeg (too expensive at my local grocery store!).  I also skipped the blender step (I like it a bit chunkier, even if it defeats the purpose of making a bisque :)).  I served it with grilled cheese.  Will definitely make again :)

This is the best tomatoe bisque I have ever tasted.  I'll be craving this the next time I'm under-the-weather.  I used a little extra nutmeg, heavy cream, tomatoe paste (whole can) and white pepper.  I serve with grilled-cheese using "Honey Wheat Bread I."

This is one of the best soups I've ever had and my husband loved it as well.  Perfect for those chilly days when you want something to help warm you up.  The nutmeg and fire roasted tomatoes definitely make this recipe.

Tasty soup and yes easy to make.  I would not add the nutmeg as it was all I tasted it seems.  I put the right amount but it seemed to not "go" with the flavor.  My boyfriend said it needed to be more tomato like in flavor.  I give it four stars because of the ease in making and it was good, but with no nutmeg.  Some might think it might add depth to the flavor.  I did not think so.

WONDERFUL!  This is a definite 5 star tomato soup.  I only wish I could have found the fire roasted diced tomatoes; I had to use plain diced tomatoes.  I added some italian seasoning to give it more spice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This recipe is a keeper and will see a lot of use at our house.  Thank you Sweetjam!
