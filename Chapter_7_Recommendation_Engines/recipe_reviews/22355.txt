I thought the basis of this recipe was good, but I was worried upon putting all ingredients together that it would be rather dry.  So, I added ketchup, cajun hot sauce and then put all of it(with noodles)in a casserole dish with shredded cheddar on top and heated in oven for a few minutes.  My husband really enjoyed it.

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I think it made it a little less tasty so I had to improvise with extra seasonings. Other than that, it was great!

This isn't so good over noodles but on crackers it is much better.  Also adding some ketchup or B-B-Q sauce is helpful.

This sounds like chili Cincinnati-style! Beef, beans, onions (usually chopped and raw on top) and lots of shredded cheese make for a delicious five-way. There are a few other "secret" spices, though, including cocoa and cinnamon. I've never tried making this at home since there are chili joints all over Cincinnati. I look forward to giving it a spin!

Not bad at all. I did add a tad bit of ketchup to the meat, to keep it moist, and from past reviews, I mixed the ingredients together, added some cheese on top, and placed the dish into the oven for a few minutes.
