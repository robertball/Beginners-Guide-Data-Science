I really liked this recipe!  I knew exactly what was going into my cereal and could adjust the sugar amount which I did.  I used 1/4 cup of homemade brown sugar because I wanted just a hint of sweetness.  Even though I don't think I baked it long enough because I could crumble it with my hands and it took longer drying in the oven, the slightly sweet crunchy end result was awesome for breakfast!

When I was a kid I always wondered what exactly a grape nut was lol. This is a great recipe, even though I didnâ€™t follow it exactly. I did what I usually do, read some recipes and reviews then go in the kitchen and experiment with what I have.  But I followed the basic formula and process of the recipe and it resulted in a cereal that tastes better than the store bought. To the recipe, I added in some oat bran, nutmeg and ground flax seed and subbed a cup or so of the wheat flour for spelt flour. Because I added a bit more dry ingredients and the recipe said to pour the batter (mine looked more like dough than batter) I added some water and a few more splashes of vanilla. I baked it for a while, I actually had to leave the house so I shut off the oven and just left it in there till I got back.  My meat grinder was grinding it too finely so I put the pieces in the food processor instead, baked it up again and it came out great. Grape nuts is my daughters favorite cereal and she likes this better. It made enough to fill up two quart jars.

I tried this, it needs some tweeking for my taste. I would add half the cinnamon, it's too much. Definitely use the meat grinder.  It takes way more than 30 minutes to do the second bake. It took almost an hour to brown the way grapenuts cereal (the brand) are. I kicked the temp up to 300. Overall, it's an easy recipe and tastes very much like its brand name lookalike.

This recipe makes an interesting "cereal", I liked it, but it is nothing like Grape Nuts. It is light and crispy, where Grape Nuts are dense and crunchy. Completely different flavor, and ingredients. The crispyness held up surprisingly well to milk.

This is a good, crunchy cereal but it has WAY too much cinnamon in it to taste like Grape-Nuts. As written, it is spicy like ginger snaps because of all the cinnamon. I will make it again but will leave out the cinnamon. Also, the grinding works better if the patty is torn into rough chunks and left overnight to dry a bit. Otherwise the grinder tends to smash the crumbs together into gobs. Also, I used 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar plus skim milk to make the 2 cups of "buttermilk"
