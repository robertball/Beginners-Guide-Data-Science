Made as written and these turned out really good. The store only had really small zucchini so mine were overstuffed but that just made them all the better. The one thing I will mention is that my zucchini did not get real cooked. It was pretty crunchy. That is how we like it but I thought I'd mention that . If you like it really soft I recommend pre-cooking it a bit prior to stuffing. You don't want to just add to the cooking time or your sausage will get dried out.
