I made these with my leftover turkey and we LOVED them.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that by baking them they did not turn out as crisp as when you deep fry them.  So next time, I think I would deep fry them.  However, my husband and kids and I LOVED these and I plan on making them anytime I have leftover turkey.  The cranberry dipping sauce was also so good to dip the eggrolls in.

Filling tasted great and using the leftover turkey this way is very clever. However, there is definitely some miscommunication with the egg roll vs spring roll wrappers. I took from the video that spring rolls can be baked and egg roll wrappers do better fried. I don't know if there are different types of spring roll wrappers but that's what I used. I liked the idea of a light wrapper and no frying. I tried baking them, and they basically melted away. I followed the recipe as written and as others suggested, I tried brushing a bit of oil to help crisp them up. The wrappers were almost like a clear goopy semi dissolved wrap and stuck to the pan.  I'm assuming the problem is me. The kids and hubby liked them ...but with a spoon... That's right, a spoon. ;)

UPDATE: talked with an Asian cooking instructor who was doing demos at our grocery today. Spring roll wrappers can be baked (with a bit of oil brushed on) BUT NOT THE RICE SPRING ROLL WRAPPERS! She pointed me to a package of frozen spring roll wrappers and the first ingredient was wheat.  Looked like the wrappers from the AR video...I guess that would have been my first clue... :)

Recipe Group Selection:  26, November 2011  I made a batch of 20 spring rolls.  We baked 14 of them and deep fried 6 of them.  The filling had a good flavor in both, but DH and I both enjoyed the baked rolls over the fried ones.  The cranberry dipping sauce was wonderful with this recipe and I would make again to go with other Asian foods I make.  I found egg roll wrappers to be very easy to work with and will be using them again.  You could make this recipe with any type of filling.  i.e.  just veggies, chicken, turkey, pork.  I plan on making another batch and freezing the spring rolls on a cookie sheet before they are baked.  When ready to serve, pull out the number needed and bake.  Thanks otis for sharing your recipe.  It made me realize that spring/egg rolls are very easy to put together.

These were good and taste similiar to my regular egg roll recipe other than the dipping sauce; it was sweet and tangy and I liked it for a change, hubby prefers hot mustard on his...  I doubled the sauce just to use up more of the canned cranberries.  I used 1 pkg. ground turkey, 1 pkg. coleslaw mix, wrapped in egg roll wrappers and fried in canola oil.    :)

GREAT RECIPE!  It is my first time making egg rolls and they came out great.  Since I've never made them I had a hard time folding the wrappers, they were tearing but I managed to still keep them together.  They were a hit with one of my neighbors. I do recommend this recipe

Tried them both ways (baked and deep fried) and given the type of filling, I must say that deep fried is MUCH better!  It only take about 1 min per roll, and I could do 2 large rolls at a time without affecting the oil temp too much.  Worth the extra calories at this time of year!  Save the spring roll wrappers (rice paper) for the type of spring rolls with really fresh, raw ingredients like cucumber, carrot, cilantro.  AWESOME dipping sauce = do not change a thing on it!

I made these for recipe group. They were easy  to make but the baked wrappers seemed dry and tough. Had I read the submitters comment first, I may have bought the spring roll wrappers which is what sounds like he originally wrote. Perhaps they would bake better or maybe I just got a bad package. These were also a little bland for me and seemed like they were missing something. We are eating leftovers for lunch so they're not a waste by any means just not a repeat for us I guess.

Thank you so much for this recipe. the kids even asked if we could make this recipe every time we have leftover turkey. Hubby who swears he doesn't like spring rolls and wasn't to sure he would like the the sauce declared this a great recipe.

WOW! I was tired of the old leftover turkey recipes and this one completely blew them out of the water. The combination of ingrediants for the make up of the spring rolls seems simple, but when put together, this Asian inspired appetizer is simply amazing. I will make this over and over with all of my left over turkey no matter if it's the day after Thanksgiving or any time of the year.

I've made this recipe for a few years now-it's always a hit.  My only variation is to add chopped dried cranberries into the filling.  Delish!

I made this for the recipe group.  It was delicious!  I thought it would be time consuming but it was not.  Was hoping the cranberry sauce part wouldn't be too sweet and it was perfect!  The edges of my spring rolls turned brown before the inside but it tasted great!  Great little recipe ;)

The eggrolls were tasty, but a bit dry.  Other than that, they were great!  I fried it in oil rather than baked it so that they shells would be crispier.

my hubby liked these, but didn't care for the sauce.  I didn't have Mrs. Dash so i used itailan seasoning instead, and used cole slaw inplace of the shredded cabbage.

Amazing recipe. I am not the best cook and this soooo impressed my family. I do have to say that it took me 3 different stores to find egg roll wraps which ended up in the walmart produce area. So worth it these took time but my family loved it. The sauce was so amazing my family asked me what else can the sauce go with. Thanks for posting!!!

It's a good idea. The sweet and sour sauce worked well for my wife and I. The rolls themselves were dryer than we would have preferred.

The filling tasted great.  I added more oyster sauce than the recipe called for, added chopped green onions and used peanut oil instead of olive oil. Baking the spring rolls did not achieve a crispy brown as seen in the pictures. The light coating of oil I added didn’t help. I baked them over 20 minutes and still no browning. My husband came in and put them in a frying pan to brown them without adding extra oil. That did the trick. Both adults and child thought they were yummy. I only had 12 egg roll wrappers and will save the extra filling for fried rice.

I love this recipe and I have made it as shown, which is great, and made changes. I found I can save time by purchasing a package of shredded cabbage and carrots and you can add any meat filling I also did this with shredded pork and chicken. When I do this I add multiple sauces in addition to the cranberry sauce. Always a big hit! 

Hardly wait to try with shrimp. :)

These were good. A little more salt than I prefer, next time will cut back on the soy or use lite soy sauce. I think mine were larger than specified as I only got 15 out of the batch. They were  tasty and an alternative to the usual Thanksgiving leftovers! We will make them again. Thanks for sharing.

I loved them and  will make them many times. I added extra oyster sauce since I love the flavor.  I will also be making them as appetizers using wonton wrappers.

This was terrific & I'll make again. The only change I made was to use fresh ginger instead of ground.  For a shortcut, I used a bag of raw cole slaw mix.  It is almost exactly 6 cups & contains carrots-easy!  I didn't have quite enough cranberry sauce left, so I threw in a few fresh cranberries & a few craisins to the sauce. Worked out just fine. 

That being said, I do have a couple of comments. I really wish someone had warned me about spring roll wrappers!!!  I hadn't used them before & had to research how to soak them, etc. 

Also, my batch made only about ? of what this recipe said. Maybe I filled mine more, but if I hadn't, these would have been all wrap and no filling. I also had to bake mine longer-more like 25 min. 

Anyway, very good recipe & easy. Thanks!

This was the first time I made spring rolls and they were delicious!  It wasn't as difficult as I expected.  I wasn't able to find spring roll wrappers, but I did find egg roll wrappers.  I found them in the produce section by the tofu if that helps anyone find them.  I spent quite awhile looking!  In preparation I used minced garlic instead of fresh, and I also added half a cup of grated yellow squash.  It mixed in great with the cabbage and carrots.  I also added a dash of cumin.  I baked the spring rolls and took the advice of others and brushed them with olive oil.  It did help them crisp up, but they were a little chewy, maybe because they were egg roll wrappers?  For the sauce I didn

These turned out great. I used less cabbage though, but also diced up some bok choy and celery. I also used low sodium soy sauce to cut back on the salt content and used fresh minced ginger, and a bit of srachi sauce to give it some heat. I did put more than 2 tbsp of mixture in the wrap, as it seemed too little, and I came nowhere near 50 like the recipe said. More like half that. Since I used egg roll wraps (store bought) I ended up frying them in canola oil. Turning them when they became golden (since I don't have a deep fryer), and then placing them on a wire rack and blotted some of the excess oil off.  The sauce was good too, although when eating them I used very little, so as not to overpower all of the flavor in the egg roll. Definitely a great way to use up some Thanksgiving leftovers to give a different taste.

Delicious!  Best use of leftover turkey I've found!  I only used dark meat because I was concerned about the white meat drying out.  Like many other reviewers, I pan fried them instead of baking.  They were outstanding! Worth the small amount of effort it takes to put them together, for sure!
