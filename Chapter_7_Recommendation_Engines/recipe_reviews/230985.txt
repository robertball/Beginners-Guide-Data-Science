The meat is fabulous and gobbled up but the gravy wasn't so good - just a bit to acidic and bitter. I think roasting the juiced oranges was a bit too much. Maybe just some of the orange peel and none of the pith would be a lot better.

Made this tonight using some leftover oranges that had started to get dried up. Followed directions and listened to some of the other comments and did not use the chunks of orange I used the zest and I juiced the oranges. The sauce was almost like a glaze. Fantastic!

Amazing flavor and easy prep. I agree that the gravy wasn't very good but it also wasn't bad. The good thing is the meat didn't need it. And my 3 yo daughter asked for thirds.

This recipe was excellent. I listened to the other reviews and made the following changes. I used navel oranges I did not put the squeezed orange pieces onto the tenderloin. I juiced my oranges and zested them. I put the zest over the top of the tenderloins. For the sauce I added agave syrup to sweeten it up a bit and it was delicious!!!!

The aromas of this dish are delightful! I used smoked salt and seasoned pepper. I used a pinot grigio for the wine. I added orange rind to my pork, as well as herbs de Provence and fresh thyme sprigs. I used only two orange halves for the juice and baking, and reserved the other juice for the sauce for the glaze afterward. I also used Cara Cara oranges. My pork turned out very juicy with a refreshing tang of orange from the rind. Lovely!

I used two naval oranges and I did put them in the pan. I think the winning note for the sauce was detected in the wine. White cooking wine, nothing fancy; although it seemed to fit bill for “light and fruity”. And I got good feedback for the sauce. My parents put it on the other things I served, namely: ziti and two vegetable sides.

Made this today for New Years brunch. Served it with scalloped potatoes. The response was great. I believe this is now my favorite pork tenderloin recipe. THANK YOU!
