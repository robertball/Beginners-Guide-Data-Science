Lisa, Such a volume of apples 'way overfilled the 9-inch plate. Then , the crust started to get real dark after 35 minutes, but the insides had barely begun to cook! ( I took the heat down to 350 at that point).
Suggestions for a little "twist " on your classic recipe: for the white sugar, I tried half white and half brown. I also added a smidgen of fresh ground ginger root.

The lemon really makes this pie exceptional!

Drop the temperature to 350 F after 25 minutes, and use a baking ring.

I had made other apple pie recipes,but this one was the best tasting and very easy to make.Because I didn't have a fresh lemon rind to zest.I just didn't put it in the suggested recipe.However,I did add the suggested amount of lemon juice,as I did have that on hand.My husband,as well as, my 18 year old son loved it.

I am relatively new to pie baking and this makes a lovely apple pie.  I used a pie ring towards the end of baking to keep the rim from over browning.  Would definitely bake it again.

This was my first pie and it turned out perfect.  Great recipe. I did use 6 cups of apple instead of 7 and I followed someone's suggestion of lowering temp after 25 minutes. People were fighting over the last piece.

loved the "new" flavor of lemon zest.  Used brown sugar instead of white and only 1/3 cup....  Still tasted great!

This pie is delicious! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and grated whole nutmeg, which is better than pre-grated. I also used one each Granny Smith, Fuji, Rome and Golden Delicious apple for a great combo of flavors. That was about 4.5 cups of apples, which was plenty. Top with Blue Bunny's Cinnamon or Butter Pecan ice-cream for a new twist to a traditional favorite. I cheated and used Pillsbury's refrigerated crusts, but it still came out great. I'll use this recipe for company and family pot lucks! It's a keeper! Paula

Great Recipe!!! I made a few changes. I rolled each apple slice around in the sugar/nutmeg/cin mixture to make sure everything was even. Fantastic recipe!

Good Recipe. I made this twice. The second time we left out the lemon peel and added very little nutmeg. It went over well.

I had my own gluten free crust and used this filling.  It turned out amazing.  A great balance of tang and sweetness.  I switched the reg flour for brown rice flour.  And scaled the recipe to using 4 cups apples because I had a regular pie shell, not deep dish.

I have been making this pie for years as it is my husband's favorite.  It is a good starter recipe, but it should be noted that with only 3/4 cups sugar to 7 cups of a tart apple like Granny Smith it is going to lean towards a more tart pie with a hint of sweet.
 
The lemon rind is a nice touch, but doesn't really add anything, so if you don't have it no big deal. You do need the lemon juice to react with the flour to thicken the juices. Also, I accidently left out the butter the last time I made it. Funnily enough I couldn't tell the difference there either so in the future I will save the calories and live without it. 
 
When I am in a bit of a rush I just squeeze the lemon over the apples in a large bowl; add the flour, sugar and spices and mix by hand, making sure to coat every piece. I find this is quicker and assures full coverage.
 
As with any pie recipe, if the crust starts to brown before it is done cooking just use a pie ring or tinfoil to cover it. The temperature is perfect for cooking the apples and with a bit of tinfoil your crust will be just fine. I would never turn the temp down for fear of undercooked apples.  It is a good idea to put the pie on a cookie sheet just in case the filling bubbles over. It makes a gooey mess in the bottom of your oven otherwise. [Ask me how I know. heehee]
 
This is a tried and true, very basic, very tart apple pie recipe. Add a bit more sugar [1/4 cup more] if you have a sweeter tooth.

My boys disliked the lemony citrus finish to the taste of this pie.  I guess I spoiled them with my usual recipe....just apples, sugar, cinnamon....they don't even like nutmeg.  Guess we all have to cook for our family's preferences.  I thought it was too much lemon taste myself.

My husband was so happy w/this recipe.  I made it w/apples off of our tree and didn't change a thing.  He has raved about it to his family and friends.  It looked so beautiful w/the eggwash/sugar over the top that I didn't want him to cut into it.  I even thought of posting a pic of FB because I was so proud of myself.  I didn't have a chance because as soon as it cooled it was half gone.  Awesome recipe!!!!!

I've made this pie several times for my family.  It has become a tradition after a trip to the apple orchard in mid-September.  It is very tasty and the lemon gives it a "light" taste.

i just made this, but the first ones crust was super-dark, so i remade it and used a crust recipe for a different type of pie, and added some fresh ginger and a little bit more cinnamon. it turned out beautifully. tastes delicious, and is this perfect golden brown color. 4 stars only because of the crust in the actual recipe.

I also turned down the oven temp as suggested by others as it was browning too fast. The lemon zest gives this a nice flavor. My apples were not as tart as Granny Smith so the zest helped bring out the flavor.

I was going to make this in a standard 9" glass pie dish, but my daughter pulled out the 3" deep monster pie pan.  Knowing the apples would shrink & leave the crust high & dry, I precooked the filling just a little on low heat in a large, covered pot.  The apple slices didn't really cook at all, just got steamed a little, but it preshrank the filling so the crust sat nicely on it.  It also cut 10 minutes or more from the baking time and ensured the filling was baked throughout.
I brushed the top with melted butter & sprinkled it with a sugar-cinnamon mix before baking. It earned rave reviews from people already stuffed with Thanksgiving dinner.  I'm keeping this one.

My family couldn't get enough of this! By Friday morning, all but one piece was left, and we almost began fighting over it. The lemon added a great layer to the pie - everyone noticed it and loved it. It took way more than three layers to use the seven cups it listed in the recipe, but we like mile-high apple pies anyways, so it wasn't a problem. Awesome recipe all in all!

I love this pie because it's simple yet classic. I mixed all the dry ingredients extra and put it in a plastic baggie. Apple pie mix! I keep that, frozen pie dough (Mom's Pie Crust) and frozen sliced apples on hand. Pie couldn't be easier! I do have a problem with the filling bubbling over my lattice but that might just be baker's error. Just remember to use foil on your edges or it will burn.

I am keeping this recipe in my recipe box, and will use it again MINUS the lemon zest and lemon juice. I love lemon in everything, but this was way too overpowering, and I felt like I was eating a lemon square apple pie. Withthe lemon zest and juice the taste is not of a traditional apple pie.

Excellent apple pie. Easy. I mix spices in bowl, then mix in apples, then place in crust. That way the spices are evenly distributed. Used Rome apples and Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust from this site. My only pie crust from now on, flaky and delicious ( I freeze half of recipe, as it makes enough for 2 - 2 crust pies). Already planning next apple pie. Fantastic.

This was my first attempt at apple pie and it tasted great! I did a few substitutions, though. I used lemon essence instead of zest and White wine in place of lemon juice cos I had no lemons. I also substituted sweetener (1/8 cup) for the sugar since I was sharing with people who don't take sugar. it was still quite sweet, so in future I'd probably use 1/4 cups of sugar. I'll definitely be trying it again.

I have very mixed feelings about this recipe. I really enjoyed the flavour (the lemon zest adds a wonderful special something!)... but it was just so darn RUNNY! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and my pie turned out incredibly soupy. I used golden delicious apples, which are normally wonderful for baking with... Perhaps next time I just need to double the amount of flour the recipe calls for?

This pie is Awesome! Just be sure and watch the temp. Of the oven. After 15 or 20 minutes turn it down to 350 if needed. (Every oven is different) Also a pie ring around the crust will help the ends from getting overly done.  If you do not have a pie ring just use foil around the edges. This pie was not dry at all.  I can always depend on allrecipes.com.  Love this site!

I made this last night. I used Fuji and Gala apples and no lemon zest, I didn't have a fresh lemon. It turned out lovely though.  My sister says it's the most natural tasting apple pie she's ever had. Thank you for sharing.

This was an excellent pie, 5 stars with a little adjustment.  This pie tastes like apples, not super sweet and spicy.  I loved that about it.  That being said, I will probably slightly increase the spices, and if using really tart apples like I did this time, I'd increase the sugar a bit too.

It was easy to make and everybody loved it! It seems like there are too many apples to fit the pie, but they cook down during the baking process. The lemon really makes this recipe worthwhile! I'll definitely be baking it again.

40 minutes on 425 and this pie comes out amazing!  Will definitely make again.  One thing the recipe could use is a suggestion on how to keep the crust as evenly browned as the rest of the pie as it appeared to be burning just as the rest of the pie was completed cooking.  Otherwise, a perfect 5!

This is the best, BY FAR, apple pie I have ever had.  The taste was diverse and sensual! The lemon zest adds that "little something" that set the taste apart from anything I've ever had at a relatives house or restaurant.  I made this with golden delicious apples, did not use the optional milk and glazed the top of the crust with butter prior to baking.  Also, I only used 3.5 cups of apples and it was plenty.  Anymore and it would have been overfilled.  
I can't imagine anyone ever saying this is not the most incredible tasting apple pie they have ever had. A must try recipe!

Great Recipe for a beginner baker like me. However, I did tweak the recipe based on the suggestions made by others. I cooked it on 425 degrees for only 25 mins and turned it down and cooked it for another 25 mins on 350 degrees. I also added pumpkin spice instead of nutmeg and I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar (made it super sweet). It came out beautiful! I am so proud of myself.

Delicious recipe to start with! Didn’t have 7 cups of apples so I added 3 cups of mixed berries. Reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup, added 2 tbs of pear white balsamic and boom,  Christmas’s pie #1 was a hit! :) Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I use a whole wheat crust and made the pie sugar free by using sucralose. It tastes terrific and tastes delicious.  I'll be making it again for Christmas. Thank you.

So good!  Easy recipe and the pie filling was just right! Not runny and had a great taste. The thing that I changed was that I didn't use flour as the thickener. I use Therm-Flo  ( got at a bulk food store...corn starch-like) .  Cut back the sugar  a little bit and it was still nice and sweet.  Great recipe!  Will make this again.  I like how the apples are layered with the dry ingredients.

Very simple but delicious pie. My mom said the trick to making sure your pie is done is to wait for it to boil over also rub milk around the crust to prevent it from getting burned

Excellent recipe, loved the flavour that the lemon added. I was a little more generous with the cinnamon, used brown sugar and I did reduce the baking temp. to 350F after 30 min. (as it was browning too quickly). I will save this recipe and definitely make it again.

Was a bit skeptical about the recipe but decided to make it anyway. Used a crust shield and baked the pie at 425 for 25 minutes then dropped the temperature to 350 and baked for another 30. My gaming group devoured the first pie, and put a significant dent in the second. Served it with vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce. Will definitely make again

This recipe was great!  Very easy and delicious.  I have never made an apple pie before and heard it could be tricky.  Everything came out perfect on the first try.  I didn’t use Granny Smith apples. My neighbor went apple picking and gave me a mixture of some red and golden apples.  I don’t know what kind of apples they were but the pie was delicious.

This turned out perfectly for me but I accidentally didn't follow the baking temp and time. I had it at 350 for 45 minutes and then 400 for 20 minutes. That mistake turned out! Perfect!

It tastes good. My filling just didn't set up like the other apple pie I usually make. It made it super mushy. Also used super fresh farmers market apples so I may try again with different granny smith apples.

I followed the directions but I like the lie a little bit on the. Sweet side so I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Added and extra tsp of flour also. It does come out a little more juicy but let it cool of and it’s delicious. Everyone that has tried my pie has asked me to make more . This recipe is the best version of apple pie I have had yet.

I had to use canned lite apples with Spleda sweetener. It turned out great! I also used a pie crust recipe of I found all Allrecipes. I followed the rest of it and used the butter and seasonings. It was fabulous!

Yummy! The baking part though, I started off at 425 for the first 30 minutes then took it down to 350 til the apples filling was soft. I watched Allrecipes video “How to make Apple Pie” great tips!

The basic recipe was fine, but it said to cook it at 425 for 4-0-50 minutes.  It came out !  I wish I had read the other comments about lowering the temp to 350.  I suggest the owner of the recipe fix the temperature setting.  It was a lot of work to just be disappointed.

The pie tasted great, but it was overcooked at that temp and time.  Next time I'll have to turn it down to 350 or follow a different recipe for cook time and temp.

Made this pie exactly as ingredients show except added a scoop (less than a 1/4 cup) of brown sugar and used 8 to 9 medium sized Cortland Apples.   Baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes!! Cortland apples are softer than some others.  The pie was excellent!!  **Would try a double crust on bottom and top next time to add a thicker crust.  **May also lessen the white sugar and just add brown sugar in its place rather then just adding brown sugar to the 3/4 cup of white / will be less sweet.  A+++

Don't forget to cover the crust for the first 15 min. I also turned the heat down to 350 once I uncovered the crust. Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Yum!

I used Granny Smith apples and followed the suggestions of the pie ring and dropping the temperature to 350 after 25 minutes ... perfect golden color and OMG the taste is phenomenal. 

I have always been put off by the sweetness of apple pies (often too sweet for my liking), but this pie just might be my go to pie from now on.

My first apple pie. First time I tried, I added the lemon juice and butter but in the end, I just couldn't be bothered. The last 3-4 pies I made, I skipped the lemon zest, the lemon juice, the butter, and the milk, and the pies ended up tasting so so very good. For 8" pies, go with 6 cups of apple.

I found that if I cut holes on the top crust toward the edges, the liquid while baking went over and spilled in my oven (oven not perfectly levelled I found out). Cutting slits didn't do this. I also found that after taking out of the oven, the apples shrink and there is a gap between the top crust and the apples. The last few ones, I baked at 425 degrees for 20 minutes instead, and then 25 minutes at 350, but could probably get away with 20/20 minutes.

This came out very good! I did use a cup less of the apples cutting them very thin. I also used a cup of fresh blueberries (since they're in season). I also used only half the sugar.

Very good -- perfect mix of sweet and tart.  Only made the filling and used an unroll-and-bake crust.

I used green apples. The pie turned out vary tart. I recommend gala or some kind of red apples.

I made as directed except I was out of nutmeg. So instead of the spices called for, I used an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice, which has cinnamon and nutmeg in it, along with allspice.  I also got too excited and after I finished crimping my crust I realized I forgot the butter. DOH!!!

 The first slice warm from the oven was awful runny, but pretty tasty... I found the lemon a little overpowering.  I don't hold the runnyness against the recipe. It may gave been my fault, forgetting the butter, so there was no fat for the flour to react with. Or my apples might have been extra juicy.

I left it on the counter overnight and I liked it better this morning. The juices thickened up considerably, and the lemon taste was a little tamer. When it was piping hot, I think it made the lemon evaporate up into my nose quickly and ruin the flavor. 

So, in conclusion, this was an above average apple pie. Next time I will add extra cinnamon, use only the zest of the lemon, leave out the lemon juice. I will add a smidge of salt to the apple slices and drain them in a colander to get a little water out of them before building the pie... I think these changes might push it to a 5 star pie.

I didn't have to use as much apples as this calls for. Also I added a bit of cardamom to the sugar/spice mix and brushed it with egg instead of milk to give it a shinier finish. It turned out great!

I felt it was very good as is, but it was sweeeet and a lot of apples. I will adjust next time to 1/2 cup sugar and up the cinnamon a little.

The only change I made was to use a different variety of apples because that is what I had. I used 3 honey crisps and 3 galas. My husband says it was the best apple pie, ever and he is 80.

Use the same recipe for peach pie....excellent! Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars. If you use any apples besides granny smith add another tblsp of flour.   the sweeter apples add more juice and may be runny. Baked at 425 for 30 mins then reduced to 375 for another 15 to 30 mins

I added dried cranberries and used assorted apples from a fruit basket. I also used egg wash instead of milk.

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  I lowered temperature to 350 after 25 minutes and used aluminum foil to protect crust around rim.  Turned out perfect and tastes great.  I did not have lemon zest; just used lemon juice.  I added 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for an added zing.

This great recipe gives you a lightly sweet pie where you can actually taste the apples! The lemon adds a nice little zing.

I made a very few minor modifications: substituted 1/4 of the white sugar with 1/4 cup brown sugar for a bit for depth of flavor. I brushed the top crust with half & half and then sprinkled with coarse sugar. Baked at 425 for only 20 minutes. Then at 350 for approximately 35-40 mins. 

One last thing- You don't need to do the layering step of the sugar & spices and apples. Just toss all these ingredients in a bowl to coat and dump into your shell. Pies are very forgiving that way! Oh, I think my pie pan is 10", so 7 apples was fine, any smaller pan and you certainly would run into trouble.

The taste of the apples was delicious. But I lowered the oven to 350 after 20 minutes and the crust still got overcooked. It was my first attempt at baking an apple pie and I was a tad disppointed.
