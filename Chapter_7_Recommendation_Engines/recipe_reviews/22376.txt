Hello! This is my recipe and I may know why some people are having trouble with this recipe turning out dry. I have cooked this beef for the last 12 years using the same stainless steel pan every time. Last time I made it, I used a Teflon pan and it turned out dry and all of the juices cooked off. This may or may not be the problem. Hope it helps.

This roast was absolutely delicious!!  I made a few changes though...I added about 2 Tbsp. worchestershire sauce to the water.  I also added only 1Tbsp oregano and increased the italian seasoning to 2 Tbsp.  I poked holes in the roast and basted it with the juices about every hour or hour and a half.  It turned out very juicy.  We ate it as an entree the first day, and sliced it for hot roast beef sandwiches the next day.  Yum! UPDATE:  Due to my DH low cholesterol diet I now make this with only 1 TBSP of olive oil instead of a half cup.  It's still very good but a lot less fat.  You can also use a venison roast in place of beef (that cuts the fat to almost nothing!)

My family & I really enjoyed this one!  I started it in the crock pot at noon put it on high & went outside to enjoy the beautiful weather, came in around 3 p.m. turned it to low, added quartered red potatoes, & sliced carrots, YUM!  I used "Italian Dressing Mix" (from this site) for the dry italian mix and because that has a significant amount of oregano & basil, I didn't add any extra.  I used 1 can of reduced sodium beef broth instead of the water & 2 bouillon cubes and I will cut the oil amount in 1/2 next time because I thought it to be too much.  The roast (I did use a rump) came out very tender & juicy, not much left over and I had a 5.5 lb. roast!  Will make again!  Thanks Michelle!!

Very tasty! I wanted something a little different from the ordinary way I prepare a roast and this was it! I added a little dried rosemary to the spices,and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce to the water and beef bouillon, keeping the liquid to 1 1/2 c.What a fabulous aujuice that made! I cooked it all day in the slow cooker,which made it extremely tender. The smell while it cooked was heavenly, and the finished product was deliciuos! Will make again for sure.

I adapted this for a crockpot; same recipe, just more time in the cooker (about 10 hours).  I also use ziplock bags to coat the roast with oil and seasonings:  one bag for each.  Then pour part of the beef broth in the seasoning baggie and smush it around.  Then pour into cooker.  You get all the seasoning this way.  Great recipe!  Makes terrific sandwiches with the leftovers, too!

Great Recipe! I used a chuck roast because that was I had on hand. Because chuck is a fattier piece of meat, I omitted the oil. Placed it in a slow cooker instead of on the stove and let it cook on low for 6 hours. Turned out great!

I must admit I was a bit worried that the spices would be too strong.  However, it turned out wonderfully.  I baked it in a crock pot on low for about 10 hours and it was so tender!

Outstanding recipe, Michelle. We really enjoyed this. I cooked it in the crockpot for 9 hours. I omitted the red pepper flakes, but didn't miss them. I added potatoes and carrots halfway thru the cooking time, then frozen peas during the last 40 minutes. Great meal. And super sandwiches the next day!

This was amazing.  I ended up making a red wine mushroom gravy to go over it and it was one of the  best roast beef recipes I have tried.  Thanks for the post.

My husband is from the Chicago area where Italian beef is very popular.  He's been disappointed in the Detroit area because there isn't any Italian Beef restaurants out here (we have Coney Islands).  Anyhow, he rated this "5 Stars" as he absolutely LOVES this Italian beef recipe (he's very fussy about it too.)  I'm not an Italian Beef fan and I like it better than what we get in Chicago.  I followed the recipe except I put it in my crock pot on low at 6am.  I checked it about 12:30pm to 1pm and it was a little pink inside so I turned the crock pot off and let it sit until dinner time where I warmed it up and ate it.  It's good but is better the second day after it's sat in the spices.  My husband liked it plain but ate it as left-overs as a sandwhich using a small roll of french bread (not as small as a baguette) sliced, with thinly sliced beef, au jus (sp?).

I used 3 lb (2 packages) of flat iron steaks for this dish.  I also cooked the meat in a pressure cooker which was done in 40 minutes.  I also make a gravy out of the remaining juice in the cooker.

My family loved this recipe.  It was fantastic the only thing I changed was I added a cup more water and baked in the oven at 350 uncovered for 4 hours it sliced and looked wonderful.  I drained the juice and it made some fantastic gravy!  My family rated this recipe "A REPEAT" as they all enjoyed it very much.  Great recipe

I did this recipe on October 17, 2009.  I used Italian seasoning and left out the red pepper flakes and the oil.  I browned the beef for about 2 minutes on each side.  I used 2 8oz. cans of Swanson Beef Broth and 1 can of water.  I added baby red potatoes and baby carrots, with a sweet onion.  I cooked on low for 10 hours, and it literally fell apart while I was trying to put it on a plate.  Very good meal.  I have a 3 year old and an 18 month old who loved this.

Delicious. Will definitely cook this again. I took advice from other posters and 1)browned the roast first to seal in juices; 2)added Worchestershire sauce; and 3)used two Ziploc bags to coat the roast in olive oil and then roll the roast in the herbs. I cooked it in a slow cooker, for about 6 hours on low. I added potatoes, onions and carrots about 2 hours into the cooking process. Next time, I would add those later, since they were quite soft. As others have said, the gravy is the best ever!!!

This is awesome!  I've made this roast several times now.  You don't need an expensive cut of meat for this one.  It always tender, juicy and falls apart when you cut it.  Makes a wonderful gravy when you add equal amounts of flour or cornstarch to cold water and then add to drippings and bring to a boil.  It's so nice not to have to prebrown the beef.  A must have recipe!

This was my first attempt at making a roast.  It was SO easy.  I don't have a kettle so I had to bake at 325.  We threw in some baby carrots, halved some potatoes and tomatoes and then made gravy from the drippings.  Served it to company; everyone was smiling.

I double the liquid and turn the beef so it gets extra saturated.  My very picky Chicago-born boyfriend loves this recipe.  It's divine the next day.

This was excellent! I cut the spices down to 1 TBS. of each, but doubled the garlic, and used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, which added a nice golden color to broth.  Put in the crockpot and it was fabulous! Added red potatoes the first day, and the next day, shredded in leftover broth and we had sandwiches with crusty french rolls. Today, since I don't have a beef roast, I am making the exact recipe with a pork roast to shred for sandwiches. This is a keeper!

We really loved this recipe.  I put it in my slow cooker for about 6 hours on low and was worried it would be dry but it was cooked well done but still moist.  I had added an extra 1 1/2 cups of beef broth.  Although it wasn't dry I do think I will cook it an hour or two shorter next time so that it is closer to medium rare.  I'll definately make it again.  Thanks!

Had company, tried this and it was excellent. Very tasty, not that complicated to make. Had with Mash Potatoes,Gravy,Mashed carrots/turnips. 
The company were very pleased with the taste and could not believe that it was a rump roast as it could be cut with a fork it was so tender...  P.S I am a male and never cooked before,Wife has M.S. and unable to cook .. So if I can prepare it anyone can.

Loved this recipe! Will definitely make again but use beef broth instead of bouillon to cut down on the salt.

I didn't love it.  Too much seasoning for not enough taste.  You literally have to scrape the seasoning off, it's so thick, which is also unattractive.  (Check out the photos others posted.  It really does look that dark.)  I'll stick with marinating and a good meat rub.

This was the best rump roast we ever had in 33 years of marriage.  I cooked it stove-top in tightly lidded dutch oven for 6 hours and kept liquid at 1.5 cups by adding water as needed.  Only used 1/4 cup oil.  Added 1/2 can tomato paste to gravy.  Thickened gravy at last minute with 2 T cornstarch.  It has to be served in thick slices (3/4").  Do not cut more than you will eat.  It can be sliced thinner the next day when cold.  If you do not like slightly spicy food use just 1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes.

The combination of spices was very flavourful. I didn't follow the directions for cooking the roast, I just did it in my oven - and it was still delicious.

I used more garlic, but other than that left it the same.  Cooked in in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.

My husband grew up in Chicago and I made this recipe for him so he could have his beloved Italian Beef sandwiches.  Unfortunately, this recipe was a big dud.  While it was very tender, it has almost no flavor.  I'll keep looking for a good italian roast beef recipe because this is not it.

I followed the recipe exact, and this was wonderful!  Not only is the meat tasty and tender, but it's extremely easy.  I will be making this again and again.

I thought that this turned out very well.  I used a bottom round roast, because that was all I could find and I cooked it for about 10 hours in a crock pot on low.  I used EVOO instead of regular oil for flavor and I only used enough to coat the roast. After being in the crock pot for that long (while I was at work) the meat just fell apart and there was no way that I could make slices out of it. I shredded the meat and poured the juice over the meat to let it soak up all the flaver.  We made sandwiches with toasted hoagie rolls and provolone cheese.  I took this to work the next day and it was even better after the meat sat in the juice overnight.  I'll make this again...Thanks!

I am making this roast for the second time this week; it is incredibly flavorful, tender, and delicious. I served it for company the first time I prepared it; sliced it thinly and poured the pan drippings over the sliced meat, it was a major hit. My husband who puts ketchup on all meats ate this without adding a drop of ketchup! It is so simple to prepare and smells so good while cooking. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

I used Penzey's Italian dressing seasoning for the "Italian seasoning" and Better than Bouillon beef paste at 3 tsp instead of the cubes....THIS WAS SOOOO DELICIOUS! And now has been added to my permanent recipe box.

The key with making Itailian Roasf beef is to put it on low in a crock pot and let it cook at least 8 hours. Another thing, I have never heard of Itailian Beef sliced. Usually it is shredded and served with peppers and some melted Mozzerella cheese. It's generally so good it can melt in your mouth.

very, very good! I like it because it doesn't use a pre-made salad dressing mix (although that's quick!) -- made in the crock pot - excellent!

Awesome Italian Beef, the best I have ever made.  I made it for my Memorial Day barbeque and it was a total hit.  I cooked it in a crock pot on low for 7 hours and I added 8 oz of pepperchini peppers but I took the pepperchini's out as soon as the beef was done as to not make it to spicy.  I didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive oil and it was fine!  I can't wait to make this again.

I was pretty disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and got a chunk of meat that was overcooked and over seasoned. I was looking for something that would be like the Italian style roast beef found in a good deli and this wasn't it. I wasted a perfectly good eye of round roast in the process.

Way too much seasoning for us!  I had cut the oregano and basil down to 1 tablespoon each and still thought it was too much.  I had made this in a crockpot and added tomato sauce as someone else suggested.  Very tender though.

I have never used a rump before and never will ever again. Even though i had it in a slow cooker for ten hours it had a bizarre texture not so good. Perhaps if the cut of meat was better this recipe would have been better.

Great roast, added  about a tbl of worc.sauce, and since i had no italian seasoning, i used pizza seasoning with an addition to some thyme. I sliced 3 1 in. slits on the top of the roast and only used a few tbl of evoo.All the juices boiled out, but added more water and opted to cook in oven at 350  instead of stove top. After  I added  about 2 tbl of cornstrach and 1/2 c red wine to the juices left in the pan and used that as gravy.

We really enjoyed this.  I didn't use the oil but did run olive oil on it as recommended in another review.  I was afraid the spiced would be overpowering but they weren't.  I cooked this in a crockpot for 8 hours and it was so tender.

I think that this recipe is pretty failproof!  I used lipton onion soup and mixed with the water.  I also added a sweet onion and some chopped celery to the mix.  I ended up cooking this in the oven in a pampered chef baking stone dish and it come out excellent.  The gravy was delish!  I served it to company and they loved.  Even my non beef eating kids liked it!

WOW!  This was the best roast beef I've ever tasted!  I did not have bouillon, so I simply salted the water. I only had about 1.5 lbs of shoulder roast, so I halved the recipe, which turned out great for my spice-loving family.  As others recommended, I baked it and added an onion to the roasting pan.  On a scale of one to five, my husband gave it a ten.

This was wonderful!!  I decreased the spices by 1/2 (kept the garlic the same!) and cooked for 4-5 hours on high in a slow cooker.  Yum!  Made great sandwiches for lunch the next day!

Outstanding!  I cooked the roast in my crockpot on low for 5 hours and added 3 cups of beef base.  After the gravy had a chance to cool down, I strained the liquid through a fat separator, thinly sliced the beef and let everything soak overnight.  The next day I had one of the beef Italian Beef sandwiches I ever had!  Thanks Michelle!

By far this is the best roast beef I have ever cooked.  It is also the easiest!  Thank you Michelle.  I will make other recipes from you.  My family LOVED it.  Thank you so much.

I started this in the crockpot this morning and cooked it on the high setting for 4 hours and it was done.  I reduced the basil, oregano and Italian seasonings to 1 1/2 TBLS.  I must be honest, while it was cooking, the smell was soooo strong that I began to worry if it would even be ediable.  By lunchtime, the smell had turned me off that I no longer wanted to try it.  However, my boyfriend came home for lunch and had some and began raving how wonderful this was.  Curiousity got the better of my senses and I tried some and it was indeed very good.  We sliced the meat and used it for roast beef sandwhiches.  Very tasty...despite the overwhelming smell.  Would make again and I think I'll just bake some cookies during that time (or burn some candles) while its cooking.  Thanks Michelle!

My husband makes this for twelve hungry (doubled of course) firefighters every weekend shift and they go crazy for it.  It's fast & easy to prepare and you don't have to babysit it.  Great for a crowd!!

Delicious! I also put it in the crock-pot. Added a small can of tomato sauce, cut up onion, and Worcestershire sauce. Cooked on high for 5 hours. Added potatoes and carrots half way through.

Incredible! Followed the recipe exactly except used about two tbsp of olive oil instead of half cup of vegetable oil. Tender, flavorful, delicious! Some might think it was slightly too salty, so halve the salt if desired. We ate it sliced with vegetables and potatoes prepped separately. It definitely has the Italian beef sandwich flavor. So good!  We will definitely be having it again.

Only changes were Lipton Onion Soup mix since I had no beef bouillon and a packet of Italian dressing mix. No salt added.  Maybe a little more water and a little less oil. This was absolutely phenomenal. I made sandwiches using deli hoagie buns and creamy horseradish sauce. The juice in the pot made to-die-for French Dip. Bought another rump roast this weekend. Will absolutely make it again.

I've referred back to this recipe many times for the au ju minus the drippings. The only other change I'd make is reducing the herbs: italian seasonings, oregano and basil. Great for thinly sliced steak leftovers!

I tried this recipe halving the herbs, and it was still too overpowering for me.  The red pepper flakes were omitted.  I like Italian seasoning, but this was over the top.  I made it in the crock pot and probably cooked it too long (about 8 hours) as it was dry.  However, with the meat juices poured over it, it was better.  I won't make this recipe again.

Too much water, the meat ended up really dry and felt more like boiled beef than roast.  It would be better to sear the meat before putting it in the broth mixture.  The seasoning, however, was great. I also added some cayenne pepper and mustard seed instead of the red pepper flakes, and fresh basil instead of dry.

YUMMY! Instead of using bouillon cubes, I used broth leftover from cooking some brats; omitted the oil and the whole part of coating the roast with oil and spices; I just tossed all of the spices in with the broth in the slow cooker and let it go for 4.5 hours, turning it half way through.  So tender and tasty.  And yes, it's spicy; but then again the pepper flakes are an optional ingredient.

My husband really liked this recipe but I did change a few things.  I used the juice out of one large pepperchini jar and a beer instead of water and beef bullion cubes.  I added all the spices (except the red crushed pepper) and let my sirlion tip roast cook on low for about 8 hours.

This recipe turned out so tender and flavorful, I'm sure it will be used again and again.  My Italian friend says she adds a can of beer to the broth and a couple of pepperocini peppers so I might try it that way next time.   Get a BIG roast for this.  I had a small one and there are no leftovers!!

This is a fantastic recipe and my new favorite way to prepare a roast!  I was nervous about cooking the roast in a kettle on the stovetop but I cannot believe how juicy and flavorful this came out.  Gone are my days of making a roast in the oven.  The only changes I made were to omit the salt (the bouillion adds enough salt) and I used 1/4c extra virgin olive oil instead of 1/2c vegetable oil.  I let this simmer covered on the stove for about 3 hours and it was perfect.  The gravy I made from the left-over liquid is an unexpected treat.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

I thought this was a terrific recipe, but I browned the meat before putting into the water. It ads another level to the flavors and seals in the juices.

This was great!  I had never made a roast before, and was intimidated, but it turned out wonderful.  I put it in the crockpot for 7 hours.  Made it for my BF for Valentine's Dinner.  Try it with 'Red Potatoes with Beans' (also on this site) for a great meal.  Thanks for sharing.

I eliminated the salt and the recipe was delicious.  The broth had enough sodium and the spices made the recipe flavorful. It isn't bland for those who like flavor, but not salt.

This is a good basic recipe. Sometimes I change up the spices, add fresh garlic, add some Lipton onion soup mix, etc. But it always turns out nice. Great for making hot beef sandwiches au jus!

My step-daughter made this for a family dinner and it was a big success. She said she followed the direction perfectly. It was yummy and even better shredded the next day for sandwiches. I will definitely make this recipe.

Very good. I actually used a wok pan (I know kind of odd- but it worked.) and the roast fit in nicely and the heat was able to convect around the roast. The meat was tender and the juices were good to make a nice light gravy. The seasonings were a little heavy, but that might have been my fault because I wanted to ensure that there was flavor. All in all, it was a nice way to make a roast.

This was so good! The ease in which it was made didn't seem to equate with how freakin' good it was. We made sandwiches with pepper jack cheese and some salsa, and it truly made the meal. Just make sure to slice it thin!

This was very simple and very tasty.  It smells wonderful while it's cooking.  As a shortcut, I combined the oil and spices and just rubbed the mixture over the beef before putting it in my cooker.

The meat came out very tender but the seasonings were much to strong.  My husband asked me to never make it again.  Maybe it would have been such a strong of a tasted if I would have got a bigger piece of meat

I would have given this recipe 5 stars because the spice combo was AWESOME, but I changed the recipe a bit.  I omited the water and beef bouillon and roasted the meat in the oven at 325 F instead of boiling in the "kettle".  I used all the remaining ingredients, but I cut the dry seasonings into 1/4 of what was called for.  I rubbed the meat in the oil and then in the garlic (minced).  I mixed all the dry seasonings in a container and then sprinkled them on top of the meat on all sides, patting them down.  I placed it fat side up on a rack and roasted it until it was medium (about 2 hours).  I paired it up with some garlic mashed potatoes and carrots.  I made this for Christmas Eve and my husband asked if it could be our new traditional meal.  :)

My husband is a very "meat and potatoes" kind of man, and I'm always looking for new ways to prepare the things that he likes--he LOVED this.  I did add some small red potatoes and carrots about half way through the cooking time, and everything came out wonderfully tender and very flavorful. A quick and easy recipe that tastes absolutely fabulous.  This one definitely goes onto the list of favorites.

My family loved the recipe, but I think I was a bit more critical. It seems as though it could have been a bit more tender, but I think next time I will try refrigerating the day before and then serving and see if this helps. All in all, it was a solid recipe for roast beef and I enjoyed it once I poured the extra juice over the meat.

I did not add salt due to the bouillion being very salty. This is something I will make again and again. Simple,convienent and delicious.  I CUT the meat at 3 hours into large slices(meat was tender enough to use a hard-plastic spatula) so as to soak up some of the juices.  Was pefect at 3-1/2 hours covered(recipe did not state whether to cover or not). Had about a cup of very flavorful juices left in pan to pour over rice, noodles,potatoes or whatever.  I opted to just use on the meat, as we are eating healthy,low- carb. Made a delicious meal with a side salad. This would be a winner made in a slow cooker, too. Thank you, Michelle! Excellent recipe! This one goes into our favorite file.

I really enjoyed this, but my friend gave it 3 stars, "almost too much flavor." Is there really such a thing? I would cut back on some of the spices. My 3 lb. Rump Roast cooked up in less than 3 hours. I also added a little tomato paste and merlot to the water/bouillion mix.

This recipe is awesome. I don't eat beef but my friends absolutely enjoyed it.  The first time I made it, I used a slow cooker and added worcestershire sauce which really helped with the smell.  The second time I made it a co-worker suggested tha I place celery in the slow cooker and that would help with the smell.  It really worked.  This is definitely a keeper and everyone absolutely loves it.

I did this recipe in the slow cooker. Very good. I thought there might be too much spice for the kids so I only put in 1/2 tsp pepper. 1 tbsp oregano, 1 tbsp basil. I also only used 2 cubes of the bouillon. It was very tasty and we had no left overs. It makese a wonderful gravy. Great recipe, thanks

This is the perfect recipe for an easy Sunday dinner.  You put it in a pot and basically forget about it.  The crushed red pepper adds a nice zing, and the meat is so tender you hardly need a knife to cut it.  Spoon the sauce in the pot over the sliced meat, and serve with roasted potatoes. I've made it 4 times in the last 3 months.

I added all my spices into a tablespoon of flour in a metal bowl mix, the metal bowl is easy to clean, roll the roast,  then browned the roast before baking.

Did this in a cast iron pot.  Came out very tender.  Next time I will cut back on spices a little more. Other then that great way to cook a so called (cheap) cut of beef.

I tried this recipe, but used chuck roast instead and cooked it in a dutch oven. Everyone loved it(I fed 11 people that day) I would suggest using chuck roast as it can handle a long cook time and is has a very beefy taste.

This was good, if a little on the strong side. Next time I will probably halve the ingredients for the same size roast so we can taste the meat more.

One of the better roast I've had.
2-7-13:  Cooked a little longer than it should have, turned out a little dry, but still a great taste.

This is a fabulous recipe that I have fixed many times.  I have also given the recipe to friends because they liked it so much and were amazed at how easy it was to prepare.  Since living in the Middle East, I have also used it to prepare camel which turned out very well.

Too dry, and I think I followed the directions OK.  The 2nd time I tried this, I used the recipe for Garlic Prime Rib and just cooked it in the oven.  That was medium rare and I used the meat slicer to make sandwich cuts.  I'll do that again.  This particular recipe was tasty but just came out too dry.

I can't say enough about this recipe! It's 2 o'clock in the morning and there's one hour left but my son has already been in the dutch oven twice and stolen some of it! It is wonderful! Followed the recipe as listed.

Searing the meat on all sides (except fat side) will hold in juices.  I rubbed the oil and spices on, seared, then added to crock pot with bullionated water and cooked on low for 10 hrs.  S-U-P-E-R  ------------------------------------- For oven i would not use a pot too much bigger than the meat.  [That will aid in drying the meat before it is fully cooked] You can place meat on a rack or place on top of chopped veggies. Then Rub, sear, and cook

The beef turned out really good...great with crusty Italian rolls and some provolone melted on top. Seasoned the roast well with salt & pepper, used a minimal amount of oil in the pan, browned it, then dumped everything (including the juices from the pan) in on low for 8-ish hours. That's the great thing about slow cooking...if you are running late, you don't have to freak out about exact cooking times! Great stuff...will definetly make this one again.

I use canned beef broth (low sodium) instead of boullion. Also, used olive oil and rosemary because I have a plant and love fresh rosemary.  Great roast!  My family loves it.  I did leave out the crushed red pepper for my children's sake.  Cooked on low in crockpot 8 hours.  With about 1 hour left, I shredded the roast and put back in the juices. I also reserved 1/2 cup of juices and sauteed onions and bell pepper on the stove. We toasted whole wheat rolls and used slice provolone (the good imported stuff).  Also fabulous the next day!!

I used low-sodium beef broth and an 8oz can of tomato sauce in place of the water and bouillon cubes.  I used the Italian dressing mix found on this website instead of the spices listed in the recipe.  I used 2 tbsp. olive oil in the place of the 1/2 cup vegetable oil because I only had a 2 pound tri-tip beef roast on hand.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 5 hours on low....It was better than any other recipe I've used. Thanks for sharing it!!!!

This recipe was easy and pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because it was way too salty for our taste. I will be making this  again but with a fraction of the salt. It reheats really well!

This got good reviews from my very picky family. They said I could make it again. I used a tri-tip roast that was just under 4 lbs. it cooked to well done 160* in under 2hrs. I made my own italian seasoning mix from the 2 recipes on this site. When done I thickened the juices with some cornstarch to make a nice light gravy/dip to serve with the roast. served with pasta and roasted carrots. I will use just a bit more crushed red peppers next time.

Amazing! Don't change a thing. Made a nice herb crust when done in the oven. A little corn starch and water to thicken, and a splash of red wine...the best gravy ever. I will definitely make again.

This was a great variation on the plain old roast!  As cattle farmers I am always looking for ways to jazz up our beef and this one is a keeper.  We enjoyed this very much! Thanks!

OMG! If I could give this more stars I would. I used beef broth and rolled a 6 lb. rump roast in the seasoning and baked it. My favorite way to have roast.
 Thank you thank you thank you - my family loves it.

Great recipe... As a relative neophyte to the world of cooking, I found this entree to be easily prepared and definitely delicious.  Did add a bit of Worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavors, as suggested by another reviewer.  Served it with fresh asparagus and freshly baked sourdough, whole wheat french bread... Mmmmmm...

Good, although we're not huge beef eaters!  We thought the meat was flavorful but the sauce was a bit too salty!  I made gravy with the sauce... If I make again, I'd leave out the extra tsp salt since it called for 3 bouillon cubes too.

Very tasty.  A nice change from other relatively bland roast beef recipes.  I did have a prob. w/ the cook time, however; I took the meat out 1 hr. early, & it was still *very* well done.  Will have to watch it more closely next time!

To be honest, I was a little leary about trying this resipe, due to the amount of spices.  I thought it was overdoing it.  Boy, was I wrong!  This has such a wonderful flavor!  And the gravy I make from the drippings is very good as well.  All I have to do is thicken it, no seasonings or salt as with a lot of other recipes.  I always cook my vegetables with the meat for the last portion of the cooking time and it gives them great flavor.  My family loves it.

This was pretty good.  I did not use all the oil called for, just "rubbed" the meat with some olive oil before rolling in the spices.  I also cooked mine in the crock pot so the beef ended up being "shredded" when all was said and done.  I will make this again.

I make this recipe in the crock pot.  It is fabulous.  Even better the next day.  I do scrape off alot of herbs before serving.  I use the broth to make gravy for a fantastic pot pie to get rid of leftovers.

Flavor was good, but my piece of meat just wasn't that good.  I can't blame the recipe for the meat.  I'll retry.  Fortunately, this site lets you edit your reviews.  I did do a cornstarch and water blend and make a gravy out of the sauce because I had to.

I didn't really care for this.  It smelled wonderful while cooking, but the flavors weren't all that wonderful with the meat.  Also, it wasn't quite tender enough at 3 1/2 hrs., and I used a smaller  roast too.  I don't think I will make this again.  All the herb flecks made it taste "hairy".  We usually don't mind "bits" in my house.  This was just a bit too many flakes in the mouth.  Seemed a waste of meat.

This makes a very flavorful roast.  Yum!  I have made this several times and follow the directions exactly.  We always have leftovers, so we make sandwiches the next day.

I actually finished cooking the roast in the oven to brown it. It tasted great, although the texture was not what I had expected. I am going to try it again, but this time I'll throw it into the rotisserie.

I made this for dinner yesterday.  Great flavor!  I cooked it with some onions, full cloves of garlic and a few carrots and added a tiny bit of horseradish for seasoning.  The meat was so tender and fantastic.  We made beef and noodles from the leftovers today and taste is just as good!

My family loves this recipe, it's one of their favorites.  It always comes out moist and tasty, no matter what cut you use.  Depending on the size of your roast, I would be careful on the amount of salt added.  I reduce mine to about 3/4 tsp on a 4 lb roast.  Otherwise, perfect!

This roast is the best ever! I did reduced the oil to just a few tablespoons as suggested by others. As a side I roasted potatoes, carrots and onions in the oven a topped them with the same herb mix. This is an awesome meal for a get-together.

Very good! Meat has great flavor. My roast had some spots that were very tender, and others not so much, but I think it had a lot more to do with the particular piece of meat I bought than it did this recipe. Very easy to prepare.  My boyfriend loved it and raved!  Will definitely use again. Thanks!

We loved this recipe and its been requested to be served again.  But..next time I will cut the oil to about 1/3rd cup (if that) and half the spices called for.  I was really uncomfortable dumping the rest of the oil in the pot as there was still so much left, but I did as the recipe called for.  I don't think its needed.  The roast fell apart for us..very tender.

Wonderful recipe!! I'm not sure if this was because I used a crock pot (high for 1 hour and low for 7), but this was the most tender and most flavorful roast we have ever eaten!!  Will definitely make again and again and again!

Very good flavor but make sure you use a tender roast. It is essential for the success of this recipe. The flavor and juices are savory. My kitchen was filled with appetite-inducing aromas!

Very good. I made this in the pressure cooker. I increased water to 2 1/2 cups and pressurized under 10lbs for an hour. I then shredded the meat and served with fresh baked italian bread. The whole family loved it. We even ate the leftovers, which is not something we usually do. Bravo!

This is absolutely awesome! Very tender and flavorful. The only thing that I do differently is that I brown the beef first and add water with beef buillon diluted in it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!! I used beef broth instead of bouillon. The first time I only cooked it 2hr&30min and cut the meat the wrong way but it was still flavorful so the second time I cooked it the whole time and cut the meat against the grain and it was much better. My husband feels no guilt in stating he doesn't like something but with this he said I should make it for our next family pot luck, it was soo good.

I fixed this recipe for a sick friend and her family.  Her husband said it was the best Italian Beef he had ever tasted.  I did cook it on low all day in my crockpot and it turned out beautifully.

Made great sandwitches the next day, but the night of it was kind of dry. But good with a good Shiraz.

Very flavorful roast beef, but a little tough.  I will try a top round instead of rump roast next time.

Well, it was well done...but it was the driest piece of meat I've ever made.   Not sure what happened.  I must have over cooked it somehow.  I don't think I'll try it again.

My family loved it, the spices added a unique flavor. A great way to 'spice up' your standard roast beef.
