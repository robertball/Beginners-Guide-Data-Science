These are very good!  I followed the recipe exactly except I eliminated the 8 oz. of butter in the topping - they were still delicious!  They reheated very well too.  Next time I'll make extra and try freezing them.

Very good recipe.  Made it for brunch when we had houseguests, served with mangos and starfruit to balance out the richness of this dish. I also omitted the butter.
