Astonishing. After all its just a burger but the combination of a little spiciness in the burger meat and the lightly sweetened peanut butter is just brilliant. I was skeptical but this turned out to be a favourite at the cottage. Some hints - this would be excellent as a slider. And if like me you are used to eating two burgers at a sitting, this burger will slow you down at a count of one. And finally, I recommend leaving the bacon off. I think its better without.

Awesome, the best burgers I have ever made. 
I leave out lettuce and tomato and add red onion, tzatziki on bun.
 Add Old cheddar cheese and thick sliced bacon, serve with Ale

Soo good...Didnt have Maple so use any jam, ect.. Super delicious!! Don't put too much Worcestershire into the meat mixture or it could become crumbly..
