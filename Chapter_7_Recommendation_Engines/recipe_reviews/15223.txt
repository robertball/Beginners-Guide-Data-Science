Easy to make and tasted good, though a little on the sweet side.

Very good recipe. I'm an expat Aussie living in the US, and miss Anzac biscuits. FYI, don't let the name fool you. A biscuit is the UK/Australian term for "cookie".

these turned out shaped more like cookies than biscuits, but they were delicious! I cut down on the sugar and they were still plenty sweet enough. I would make again.

These cookies are habit-forming! I've used this recipe several times because I love the taste of macadamia nuts and coconut. The only thing I do differently is add more water; about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons. The mixture will not hold together for me otherwise. For a uniform product, I press the cookie dough into a small cookie scoop, place them on an airbake cookie sheet then flatten them with a greased and sugared glass bottom (make sure it's flat-bottomed.) At 12 minutes, they are chewy; at 15 minutes they are crunchy, as stated.

I absolutely love this recipe! This cookie is best described as a chewy (or crunchy) sweet oatmeal cookie. It is very delicious. The macadamia nuts and coconut flakes give the cookie a great texture that compliments the oatmeal. What I like about this recipe is that it is egg-free, so the batter is definately safe to eat! The time-consuming part of the baking process is placing the dough on the cookie sheets. The dough is crumbly, and a bit dry so I recommend rolling the dough into small balls (not too compact), and then flattening them, shaping them into circles. The three centimeters for spacing is something that should be taken into consideration because these cookies do spread out quite a bit. I was also told by an Australian friend to let the cookies "age" for two or three days to achieve a chewier texture. Happy baking!

I put the baking powder in at the wrong stage (oops!) and left out the macadamias (I'm a broke student) and it still turned out nice.

I was a little nervous half way through, the dough was very crumbly and in no shape to teaspoon onto my tray.  However after compressing the dough into hard little balls in my fist and then flattening them into biscuit shapes it turned out just lovely.

They remind me a little of the uncle toby's break free biscuits.  :-)

The thing I liked best about preparing this cookie was no electric beater. One less thing clean and put away. The stages were easy and the results were as written in the directions. Baked for 12 minutes gives you a nice sweet chewy cookie.

These are SO good! I made two batches, one chewy and one crunchy. I think im more of a chewy fan. The dough wasnt dry for me at all. Very yummy!

note: The Australian word Bikkie or Biscuit is what we Americans call Cookie.

I received this recipe from an Assie friend 10 years ago and every time I make these "Anzac Bikkies" people want the recipe. 
Instead of the Macadamia nuts my version has 1/3 cup of golden rasins. Which the Assies call "Sultanas" and instead of honey I use clear corn syrup.

I would just like to suggest that the recipe be changed to say quick cooking oats...  I used rolled oats like the recipe says and the dough is ridiculous.  the oats are so huge and it doesn't even resemble dough.  I'm thinking about adding an egg to see if I can turn this back into some sort of a cookie.  WEIRD.  Too bad I wasted some time and money and made weird granola instead of cookies.

Friends at work rated these between 3 and 5. Someone suggested adding chocolate chips. If I made these again, I would not toast the macadamia nuts. I didn't care for the toasted flavor.

These were great. I think toasting the macadamia nuts was a huge add in the taste department. A great recipe for people who donâ€™t like raisins. History of these is that moms and wives of the ANZAC (Australia New Zealand Armed Corps) would send these over during WW1 because they kept forever.
