I'm eating a slice as I type this and it's exceptional. I used a store bought crust and egg whites instead of pasteurized stuff. The risk of salmonella is there but it'd at least give me an excuse to miss finals right?

For the peppermint candies I just took a few hand fulls of the after dinner mints from the restaurant I work at and crushed them all using a metal bowl and a can of green beans. That took more work than the rest of pie!

Overall I highly recommend this. This is very much a holiday pie, and is very sweet. Whipped cream and some red and green sprinkles are the perfect topper!

A disclaimer is that I realized, the second time I made this pie, that I had used "whipped cream" instead of whipping cream!  But overall I am not convinced it made so much of a difference.  This is an easy, tasty pie that I make at home but is not quite elegant enough that I would bring it to a party or serve to guests.  The first time I used hard peppermint candies and the second time I used some candy I had on hand - similar to a Junior Mint - and it was a lot easier to break up and stir into the mixture.  It's a tasty winter pie - and, again, pretty darn easy to make.
