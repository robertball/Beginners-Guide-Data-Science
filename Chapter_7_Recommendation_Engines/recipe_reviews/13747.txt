This is one of my favorite side dishes 
of all time!  It works well in a slow 
cooker, too.

Absolutely delicious! I think this recipe definitely needs some well deserved attention.  I ended up keeping them in the crock pot on low for 8 hours, because I didn't read ahead and planned on making it while I was at work.  There was the perfect blend of sweet from the brown sugar and sour from the vinegar.  I was a bit worried about the lima beans, but they ended up turning out as a creamy delicious bean.  I paired it with coleslaw and hot dogs and the guys loved it.  These will definitely be made again in our house!  Thanks for sharing!

I've made a nearly-identical version of this since the 70's and I love it!  Everyone seems to.  My version doesn't have kidney beans and only calls for 10 slices of bacon.  It's still the same...thanks for reminding me of this favorite!

I love beans, and I love sweet and sour, so I knew this recipe would be good.  After I mixed all of the items, I put them in a casserole dish and baked them for a little more than an hour.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!! As a male my wife would prefer I not eat beans. "understandable" These tasted great and did not upset my tummy at all. She ask me to fix them again soon.

My mother in law makes a recipe similar to this.  I've not asked her for her recipe yet, so this was a great stand in.  My husband thinks there is a little too much vinegar, but overall it gets raves when I serve it.

I have a very similar recipe that I received from a farm cookbook years ago. It includes a pound of hamburger. It makes an excellent main dish.

I was just browsing through my recipes & found this.  I made it years ago & I guess I saved it so I could rate it - to be sure I didn't make it again.  I made this thinking it'd be a big hit (with all the good reviews), but no one liked it.  A bunch of sweet & sour bean lovers I guess we aren't.  This was too vinegary for me.  Anyone trying it for the first time should hold back I think.  Sorry I didn't like this one.

This soooo close to a "mixed bean" recipe I used to impress! However,  the carton containig my recipe box mysteriously disappeared as a consequence of my last household move. My feet are securely plantd in my hometown- so what I have will act as a stand-in stuffed cat.
The difference b-tween the recipes is jelled cranberry sauce was the ingredient lending it's sweet and tangy taste. No vinegar, no sugar.
Fear not! This is an excellent concoction..... Make it........soon!

My family loved these beans! I'm not a fan of lima beans. The sauce was perfect combination to coat the lina beans. My pickest daughter loved it too! Will definitely be a staple in our household.

I always add hamburger to my beans as well as a tad bit of liquid smoke, add to your liking, gives it that awesome smoke flavor, be careful not to add to much off the bat, you can always add more!

A co-worker of mine back in the 80's gave me the same recipe except it also had wax beans (like green beans). Instead of bacon, the recipe called for a pound of ground sausage and a pound of smoked sausage. It was fantastic!

Absolutely amazing!!  Sooooo good. I could eat this every week.  I cut the bacon to 12 oz and cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, just to make it a little healthier, but use 3 good sized onions because they will cook down.  I drained and rinsed the kidney beans and lima beans, as the recipe says, and add butter beans and baked beans right from the can.  I have never liked lima beans but in this they are delicious!  I cooked as directed on the stove top and it is just a very easy, VERY delicious, and very healthy recipe.  These are great served hot, or served cold like a cold bean salad.  I mixed in a few cut up cold smoky links when I serve it cold for lunch, or serve hot with a slice of ham, or your favorite sausage.  I also added a little liquid smoke to the sweet and sour sauce because I had some.   I will make this again and again.

Great beans.  Changes I made were to make it gluten free by using apple cider vinegar (I actually prefer it this way). You can skip the garlic if you choose and it's still good.

Delicious  I made 1 change. The hamburger seemed odd so I substituted spicy sausage. It really was a great offset to the sweetness.
