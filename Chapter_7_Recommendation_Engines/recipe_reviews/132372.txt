Loved this!  I did change it by using a whole pound of bacon, I used all milk instead of half&half (I also added some melted butter in with the milk), and I used canned mushrooms and a little more cheese than called for, but it was great!  A big hit with the whole family, I will make this one again FOR SURE :)

We thought this was good and worth hanging onto, but definitely needed something to "kick it up" a notch, whether it be some chopped jalape√±o peppers or maybe some jack cheese.  All in all, we enjoyed it and I will make again.  Also, I think I would add a bit more bacon, it wasn't very noticeable.

I made this on a sat. morning and after reading reviews first, I decided to use 1cp. extra sharp chedder(shredded) and 1cp. shredded chedder then I added 1/2tsp of paprika and some chopped jalapeno.  This really set it off.  My husband and our grown kids loved this.  Even my 6 yr old grand daughter asked for more...showing not too spicey even for a little girl.  Very easy and so very good.

I needed to feed a small army, so I doubled the recipe and added: 6 Roma tomates, seeded and chopped; 2 large red onions, chopped and fried in small amount of butter ; 1 green and 1 yellow Bell pepper, seeded and chopped and fried with the red onion. Throw it in with the mushrooms and it was off to the races. Excellent and easy. Had some left over ham and threw that in, too. This strata, fresh fruit and fruit juice and warm tortillas fed an army for CHEAP...

If you've got kids, try cutting out some fun shapes in the bread and using them as a top layer (hearts, stars, etc...). Also, this recipe seemed pretty bland. Turn three stars into five with a little tweaking :) Salt and pepper, chopped onions and peppers, and a little extra pepper jack cheese sprinkled on top of the final product will turn this slightly bland dish into a real morning waker upper! You can also use diced ham instead of bacon, and if you can't eat pork, then try diced chicken!

I used whole wheat bread, for the cheese I used one cup jalapeno pepper jack cheese along with one cup sharp chedder cheese. Instead of 2 1/2 cups of half and half I used 1 1/4 cups 2% milk and 1 1/4 cups half and half. Used one pound of bacon or you can use part bacon and part sausage to jazz it up.

Too much bread/wheat. Most health-conscious people did not want to eat it. To heavy for a breakfast meal with all that bread. Might try it w/o the bread.

I made this as written and it seemed rather dry. I think I will stick with the type of strata that you assemble like sandwiches.

I babysat for a neighbor in dire need of childcare for an entire week (10 hour days with a 7 month old for 6 days) and for the weekend my 3 grand kids were here. Because I was so tired, I really didn't want to get too involved with a big breakfast as is our custom for Sunday AM's; pancakes, bacon, eggs, homefries, bacon, and biscuits; etc. I found this recipe and its simplicity and ease of prep marked it as a possible keeper. I made this Saturday night and refrigerated it for our Sunday AM breakfast.  My precious husband got up, made the coffee, put this in the oven to bake and the pure Heavenly aroma wafting through our house woke me up.  I have to tell you, this is the BEST way to start your day.  It is sooo simple, so delicious and so comforting.  Everyone loved it.  I did use fat free half and half out of guilt!  This could easily become standard fare for Sunday AM or for a week night supper.

This was ok.  It has potential, but not too flavorful as others who actually reviewed the recipe itself have stated.  Being somewhat lactose intolerant I had to use my personal sub for the half and half, which was 1 cup of whole fat yogurt with active cultures and 1.5 cup of soy milk.  Whole fat dairy has less lactose than fat free and the active cultures produce a natural lactase so they break down most of the lactose.  The other changes were to use 1 cup of liquid egg whites in place of 4 eggs, which is a personal preference when I make a heavy egg dish, and only use 1.5 cups of sharp shredded cheddar that I made sure it had 0g of sugar, which means it's lactose free (lactose is a sugar).  I mixed 1 cup of the cheese with the bread and 1/2 cup sprinkled on the top of it.  I also used 1/2 lb of uncured turkey bacon.  If I make again I'm going to only use 1 cup of soy milk and add in 1/4 cup of maple syrup and some cinnamon to see if that adds flavor to the mix.

Have made this a number of times, often with variations depending what I have available. Including adding peppers, onions, paprika and stronger cheese.  I don't bother with the bacon as I like to serve the Strata WITH either sausages or bacon and hash browns (all of which can be pre cooked and re heated when the Strata is in the over.  Sometimes serve with cooked tomatoes too

I agree with a lot of the viewers.  The texture was really nice (even though in the morning some of the bread wasn't soaked at all) but it's like a souffle - it fluffs up a ton, so make sure your guests get to see it before it deflates.  I made sure to shred good quality cheddar and didn't taste it at all, and I thought the recipe could have easily withstood a few more strips of bacon.

I wanted to love this recipe but it was just bland.

This is okay.  I've had strata before and wasn't impressed, but I wanted to give it another shot bc I had some bread that was stale and crumbling.  I'm okay with the soaking overnight, but I don't like that the bread seems soggy.  The eggs had set, so I'm pretty sure it was done.  I think I might like this better if I made it in a muffin tin--I was good with the parts where the bread was toasted and not soggy, just didn't like the rest.  I used a flavored boursin cheese bc I was very low on chedder and added hot sauce.  I don't have bacon and ended up subbing pepperoni for the bacon, which actuallly ended up making the strata a lot more flavorful.  I think I'd try this again in a muffin tin and make sure I add a lot more hot sauce if I don't have that pepperoni around.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it for Christmas morning.  It was very good, and everyone ate it.  The only thing was the outside was a little too brown, but I had to let it because the middle wasn't done.  I should have covered it for the first part of baking.  Thank you for the recipe though.

I added not only mushrooms, but diced white onion, jalapenos, and white potatoes (highly recommended)...and it was very filling!  The potatoes really helped add more substance to such a fluffy dish.

This was good, quick and easy.  I cut back on the cheese since we don't like that much in any recipe...still great.  I added some parsley for color, would be great with 1/4 each of red and green pepper as well.  A keeper, especially to build upon.

This is exactly the type of recipe I need for my large family when they are here for holidays.   I always look for make-ahead recipes.  I am eager to try it, and I always love reading the ideas other readers come up with.

This was fine, but nothing to write home about.  I'm with Babskitchen - needs something to kick it up a bit.  It was fine ... but bland.  Add SOMETHING.

I added 1/4 cup of finely diced onion and a tablespoon of the jarred diced jalapenos to 2 tablespoons of butter and cooked in a pan till onions were tender. I then added this to the egg/milk mixture. I mixed bacon and some breakfast sausage for more flavor, layering with bread cubes in dish along with several different cheeses that I had remaining (cheddar, mont jack, parm). Poured egg mixture over and let sit overnight.  It took longer than 60 mins to bake becuse of the deep dish I used and the additional meat. This was a big hit! Yum!

super simple - I'm always looking for make ahead recipes.  I didn't change a thing and we all enjoyed it.  Wondering if I could use hashbrowns instead of bread?  I'm not crazy about the toasted bread on top.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!!

If you want this to be even more 'fluffy', cut the crusts from the bread.  It works fine with skim milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2.  I have also added 'fake crab' instead of bacon, needs parsley too.

I made this without the bread (gluten free) but used 2 tsp baking powder to give it fluffyness/  Also added 1 c pico de gallo and reduced the half and half to 1 cup.  Family loved it!  I'll definitely make again.

This dish was very easy and tasted good.  I did increase the amount of bacon to closer to 1 pound.  There was a lot of bread compared to egg which is what keeps me from giving it 5 stars.

Very easy and good recipe.  I made it for some ovo-lacto vegetarian guests.  I omitted the bacon and substituted a handful of chopped fresh basil.  This kicked up the taste a notch, and met my vegetarian requirements.  Would also like to try with chopped fresh spinach or cooked chopped broccoli as vegetarian options.

As is we had to give a 4 star, but next time I'd add a splash of hot sauce or even use our homemade Italian Sausage. Also will use less bread because we'd like to taste more egg than bread.

I made this for my families Christmas breakfast.  I only made a few changes, I increases the bacon (about 1/2 a pound) and the mustard (around a Tbsp).  I also covered the casserole the first 40 minutes of cooking.  It was very yummy!

This recipe was delicious - my son ate 3rds the first time I made it.  I did leave out the mushrooms as they are not a favorite of his and it was very good even without them.  Definately one I will make again.....and again!

This is wonderful. Didn't change a thing. The ready time for 9 1/2 hours is because of the 8 hour overnight refrigeration time.

Great recipe.  I substituted half the eggs with egg substitute and added some peppers and onions. I also added a whole pound of bacon based on some of the other reviews. It was a hit at a breakfast potluck I had at work. Will definitely make it again.

OMG this was delicious . The whole family devoured it. I added about an extra cup of cheese and a bit more bacon then called for. Also I grated some more cheese to sprinkle on top before I put it in the oven. This was probably the best breakfast dish I have ever made. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my lady's group and everyone commented on how delicious it was.  I added green onions and mushrooms to pep it up a little.  I made a double batch which was alot but it kept and we had leftovers for a couple days.  It was just as good day 3 as day 1.

I made a few changes to this recipe, but that is what is so great about it-very adaptable.  I made an "italian" version-I still used bacon (turkey bacon) and cheese but I sauteed some onion, garlic and diced tomato that I mixed with the egg and milk, and I plucked some fresh parsley and basil from my herb pot and chiffonaded that into the mix.  I also used some grated parmesan cheese in place of some of the cheddar.  Lastly, because half and half was a bit heavy for my tasted I used regular milk.  Great recipe everyone loved it. Next time I will use spinach and mushrooms.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding more bacon.  It was tasty, but too dry -- I will use less bread next time, and will also try using milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 to save a few calories.  I'll also try other ingredients such as ham instead of the bacon, and maybe some diced green chiles.  It's good enough to try again with some tweaking.

The main reason this dish is bland is the missing spices.  You need to add salt and pepper at a minimum.  Def needs extra cheese and bacon. I always add garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, pinch of cayenne, etc.  As for extras, I like jalapenos, onions, bell peppers, broccoli, sausage- well I could add just about anything.  This is really just a base to make into your masterpiece.  I really like the idea of using stuffing or hash browns in lieu of bread.  Be creative!  Use what your family loves.

I followed the advice from some other reviews and added green pepper, onion and additional bacon. I think without the extras it would have been way to bland.

I eliminated the mustard and added a few spins of fresh, cracked pepper and it was delicious! I halved the recipe, as I was just feeding my parents and it turned out beautifully after 45-50 minutes. They agreed it was a make again. I used the Tuscan bread from Trader Joe's.

I am always looking for "prep ahead" dishes for family Sunday breakfasts and this is perfect. The only change I made was to use the "pre-cooked" bacon slices.  I used one 12 oz package.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I will try adding in peppers and other items in the future.  Thanks for another great recipe.

I made this with whole wheat bread, 3/4 lb. of bacon, and milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  It filled my 9 x 13 baking dish to the brim, and turned out great.  I think the 1/2 and 1/2 might be worth the extra calories.  Next time I might try it that way.  Thanks for a great recipe Serenity.

Great base recipe for a breakfast bake. I used whole milk instead (what I had on hand). Added some salt, pepper, and dried parsley to the egg mix. Also used whole pound cooked and crumbled bacon, left out mushrooms, and added saut√©ed onions and bell peppers. I will definitely be using this base in the future. Will try sausage, ham, and other veggie combinations. I will be using 1lb of whatever meat I use though (1/4 cup is definitely not enough!). Easy to tailor to your own taste. Guests loved it. Thanks!

I use the following:  regular sandwich bread, 2% milk instead of the  half-and-half, and depending what mood I'm in, I'll add chopped green peppers and onions that had been saut√©ed in the residue of whatever breakfast meat I decided to use. This recipe is great with crumbled sausage.

This was yummy! I used 12 slices of bacon, no mustard nor mushrooms. I let it cook about 75 mins until the center looked as fluffy as the edges, and then let it rest about 10-15 mins. It was crispy on the edges yet fluffy and perfect on the inside. Very good start to our Christmas morning! I'll use this again with different flavor ingredients.

I made 1 1/2 times the recipes, used no mushrooms, and baked in 3 8x8 inch pans for brunch.  I got rave reviews, and gave out copies of the recipe.  Next time I will be more creative in adding ingredients.  I did use 1 lb bacon for the expanded recipe.  Very easy.  Very good.

We love this casserole.  Have made it a few times.  We had a big crowd for a family gathering and doubled it.  Used a pound of bacon and a pound of sausage and cooked them ahead of time.  Delicious.  And put it in a large, disposable pan, so easy prep and easy clean up.   We have also used some smoked cheddar, which gives it a great flavor.

Very good! Added more bacon and cheese than called for. Also made it once with just milk and it was delicious. Needed a little more spice, so added some hot sauce and seasoned salt & pepper the next time.

I used a full pound of bacon and saut√©ed an onion & green pepper with a little bit of the bacon grease as some of the other reviews called for. Used white-wheat bread, added salt & pepper to the eggs and put hot sauce on the table. Everyone loved it!

This tasted very good and everyone liked it , of course it was good, it's loaded with cream. However,  I followed the recipes for 12 people and it made enough to feed a small army.  Be careful, when sizing.  It called for 24 eggs and an entire loaf of bread - it should have been a tip off for me.

Love this recipe the way it is!   It‚Äôs fantastic.   We did, however, after time modify it to our liking by adding green pepper and a pinch of nutmeg in egg mixture.   We also used jalape√±o cheese for a bit of a kick.

made this Christmas morning, sans mushrooms. Everyone loved it, but next time I'd use 50%-100% more bacon. I used most of a loaf of French bread (18 slices ~1" thick).

I don't refrigerate this overnight. As long as your bread cubes suck up the egg mixture before baking it will come out well. A strata is essentially a savory bread pudding sans sugar. I use 4 slices of thick cut cooked bacon and also add about 1T dried onion flakes (or 1/4th C fresh minced).  

This also tastes great using pork sausage and having sausage gravy on the side.

I needed a breakfast casserole for Christmas morning and I liked how the reviews sounded for this recipe. I used a whole package of bacon crumbled, whole wheat thick sliced bread and added more milk, cheese and butter. I left it in the fridge overnight as recommended and it turned out fluffy and very tasty. I would make it again, definitely!

The only thing I differently as to sprinkle the top with fresh chopped green onions.  Perfect! Added a little color and tasted great.

This was so yummy there wasn‚Äôt a crumb left behind.
I see the potential for ‚Äòvegging it up‚Äô... maybe a spinach layer?

Christmas Brunch tends to be a bit heavy on bread, so I used potato instead of bread. It also makes it gluten-free. Great reviews from everyone. I forgot the mustard, but it wasn't missed, apparently.

It was fun to make and it looked great, but it was very bland. It needed garlic and onions to give it more flavor. I put garlic chili sauce on it to give it some kick.

My husband doesn't care for mustard, so I omitted that. Per others' recommendations, I used a pound of bacon, 1 small onion (chopped), some red pepper, about 1/2 tsp of salt and some pepper.  The whole family really enjoyed it!

Okay, don't be angry everyone but I needed to make something vegetarian for a guest.  So, I saut√©ed mushrooms, onions, asparagus, red & yellow peppers in butter first.  Drained them when cooked and put the veggies in place of the bacon.  Everything else I made the same as directed(okay I added an additional cup of cheese).  It turned out INCREDIBLE!  Everyone loved it.  I think the basic recipe can be adjusted to add your favorite veggies or meat.  I will definitely make this again.  Also, very easy to make.

Definite keeper.  Husband loved it.  I halved the recipe, but as other reviews suggested, I kept the bacon and cheese proportions the same as the original.   I also added some saut√©ed onion and half a minced scotch bonnet pepper.   Used homemade dinner rolls, because that's all I had.  Great that it's prepped ahead.  Delicious,  thank you.

I substituted sausage in place of the bacon and used gluten free bread.  I also added mushrooms and green onion.

I followed the recipe  and added diced peppers and tomatoes as well increased the bacon. We found it bland and dry, Was disappointing as the reviews were good. Will not make it again.

Love it! I covered it to make sure it won't dry out and reduce cooking time to 40 minutes, an broiled it for 3 minutes.
Added more bacon, as suggested here.

great recipe!  Tweeted it a bit.  Put the bacon on the top only,
used a little more cheese and mixed in some feta.
My brother had 4 servings and we finished the entire strata in one sitting!
Next time I would use even more spinach.  Great addition to the  strata.

Based on the other reviewers, I doubled the bacon, and because of a sale at my store, I used precooked bacon. The recipe was easy and delicious, especially with real maple syrup poured on top. This one will be an Easter and guest tradition.

This was pretty bland. Not crazy about the texture either. Other strata recipes that keep the bread slices whole, I think, produce a better texture. I will not make this again.

It had the potential to be fantastic, but we ended up with a bunch of fluffy egg yummy at the bottom and hard as rock pieces of dry bread on top.

I'll make this again, but instead of pouring the egg over the top, I'll toss the bread in it evenly.
