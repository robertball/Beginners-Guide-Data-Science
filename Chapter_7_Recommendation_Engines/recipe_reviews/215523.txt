I'm the submitter of the recipe.  Pleaese note that the rice vinegar is unseasoned.  If you are using seasoned rice vinegar, please omit the sugar.  The burgers can be cooked to your preference as long as you keep to the recommended safe temp.  We prefer them browned.

These got rave reviews from everyone! I did as another reviewer has suggested and used all the marinade but only 1 pound of the ground pork. The pickle was just right. I had been looking for a recipe forever for it. This would also taste great on something like a Vietnamese vermicelli bowl or just just over rice without the bun. I'm also thinking of turning the burger part into meatballs for bento lunches.

By far the best burger I've ever made.  I substituted a lot of ingredients for this.  I couldn't find mirin so I used Sherry with an equal part of sugar dissolved in it.  for the tamari, I used soy sauce.  I thought I had ginger at home, turns out I didn't so I used pickled ginger and for the sesame oil which I also thought I had I substituted chili oil.  I was surprised how amazing this burger turned out considering I didn't have half of the ingredients but my god was it amazing!! I definitely plan on making this again!

We LOVED these!  I reduced the pork to 1 pound, but kept the measurements of the additions the same; the burgers were moist and very flavorful.  I didn't use the cucumber pickle in this recipe because I already had some homemade do chua (carrot & radish pickle) in my refrigerator.  This definitely fits the bill when you're craving Asian food, and is much faster than take out!

Excellent.  I added some chopped garlic to the patties, topped with some cilantro and mayo, and served it on a baguette.  Easily the best Bahn Mi I've ever had.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe, made them once and the whole family loved them.  Making them again as they keep asking for them, especially the homemade pickles.  Adding a cilantro, mint, mayo tabasco mayo this time to top it off.

These were great!  Made some minor changes but kept the flavors the same.  Didn't have fresh mint or basil so I worked about 1 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp crushed mint into the meat mixture.  As others advised, I left all amounts the same but scaled meat back to 1 lb.  My husband made a sauce for his by adding 1 Tbsp flour to the drippings (cooked on stove top rather than outdoor grill) and said it was really good.

super yummy!!  A 20oz pkg of extra lean ground pork makes 4 burgers @about 220 cal apiece (not counting the bun).  I'm sure the tamari sauce would be yummy, but regular soy sauce was good too.  And I used all rice vinegar, no mirin.

Best burger I've ever made. The only change I made was to put it on a hearty sourdough bun instead of the sesame seed buns.

Delicious! My Japanese DIL said they tasted exactly like the ones served in a popular Tokyo restsurant. I was overly cautious about the spiciness, so only added half the amount of chili paste called for. Next time, I'll use 3/4 the directed amount. I doubled the veggies and their marinade. I will triple those next time. I made 8 parties and served them with a choice of toasted whole wheat hard rolls, and lettuce wraps.

Made this with 1 lb of ground pork. Added the entire amount of seasonings to the meat and also increased the cucumber salad (added a finely minced Thai pepper to the cucumbers) It was delicious!  But we didnâ€™t make the sandwich. Served it with white rice and used the cucumber salad plus dressing over the rice. Will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this burger.  I followed other reviews and used 1 lb. ground pork, but kept the sauce measurements the same.  The burgers were very wet and kind of fell apart, but turned out moist and delicious.  I would make again.

Loved it! Would probably add ~1/2 a jalapeno to the pickle mixture next time.

Best burger I've ever made! I did make some substitutions based on what I had at hand. I used tahini instead of sesame oil, a dash of  Maggi instead of tamari, and ground beef. I had a little over a pound of meat, but I used the entire amt of seasoning.  Pickled veggies were just amazing. (I put a little leftover ginger in there). I ate mine burger style, with some cilantro mayo (cilantro and sirachi in mayo to taste). DH ate his bunless, with beau coup veggies piled on top. 
We like sliders for get togethers at Moms, and these will make tasty and tender little patties - perfect serving size for buffet style dining.

I was going thru my recipes and I could have sworn I rated these before because they are absolutely delicious, one of my favorite burger recipes EVER!  Make the pickle relish the night before if you have time.  The flavors work together in perfect harmony!

Tasty.. I was worried about them holding together.. but if you brown them really well they will be fine. Next time I think I might add a few panko crumbs as a binder
