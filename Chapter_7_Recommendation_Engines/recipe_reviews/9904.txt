This was fabulous!  I made recipe exactly as stated, except I took the previous advice and used 1/2 C butter for the crust, and the whole bag of chocolate chips.  I used finely chopped almonds (toasted) - wonderful!  A minute may be a bit long for the toffee to boil, as mine reached the soft ball stage by about 30 seconds, and I removed from heat at that point. It would have been way too hard if boiled any longer.  Thanks to you both Pamela and Victoria for this entirely addicting recipe!

I must say that at first taste I was not impressed, but these definitely are better the next day! My husband and I ended up loving them! I took other's advice and doubled the toffee layer, it really needs it and make sure to take the toffee off the burner as soon as it comes to a boil, do not boil for a minute afterwards. The only thing I will do next time is cook the graham cracker crust a few minutes less, it tasted a little burned around the edges. But I'll definitely make again, these were delish!

ok like some of the others i changed the recipe up a bit. first i changed the crust to 1 2/3 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter.  for the toffee layer, i doubled the recipe and added a bit of vanilla. before i baked the crust i sprinkled on a thin layer of cocoa/powdered sugar to add a bit more chocolate taste. and like another reviewer, i cut the bars before completely cooled to make it easier and to keep them from falling apart.  these are great right away or days later(assuming they last that long!) definitely a great recipe to have when you need to take something to a gathering, or just need a bit of a pick-me-up! love it!

I just LOVE this recipe!!! I make these anytime I have to take a dessert someplace.  I've never met a single person who didn't like these toffee bars.  It's worth the pain of stirring the toffee forever when you hear all of the rave reviews.  BIG HINT:  I use sliced almonds on top instead of walnuts - it makes the cookies look beautiful!  Many people thought I had bought them from a bakery - they looked professionally done with the almonds on top.

WOW!  I wish I could give this more than five stars.  I was home alone when I tasted the result, and I exclaimed "Oh my gosh!" out loud.  These were so good, and easy!  I love brown sugar and toffee so the taste was perfect for me.  Next time, I may double the toffee layer just to give it a bigger toffee taste.  The toffee sort of sinks into the crust when you bake it the second time.

These are INSANELY good!!! I could eat the entire pan!  They taste just like toffee so I'm not sure what another reviewer was saying that they didn't.  The only thing I changed about this recipe was using pecans instead of walnuts (I simply didn't have any) and it was FABULOUS!!!  If you have your heat too high then the butter sugar mixture will turn into a ball...otherwise will be fine.  I boiled mine over a minute and it was great.  I don't think it needs anymore chocolate...really, really great bar!! Thank you!

YUMMMM!!
I made these for a bake-sale as a "sugar free option" and they were gone in less than 10 minutes!  Do yourself a favor, buy a box of crushed graham crackers (they're sold in the baking aisle)to save time and aggrivation of crushing crackers.  
I used splenda brown sugar and sf hersheys chocolate bars (chopped them up) for the top.  unbelievably good!!

These turned out pretty good - although boiling for 1 minute was way too long, and the toffee ended up slightly burnt. I will take it off the stove and  into the pan almost immediately after it starts boiling the next time I make them. Yum!!

These are excellent and easy!  I made these on a baking sheet with a rim around the edges (basically a jelly roll pan), and it was perfect.  They are very crumbly, but I think that's how they are supposed to be.  Very much resembled almond roca in taste, although I used pecans in ours.

I made these 12/11 for a Holiday work party on the 14th because there were so many different reviews, I wanted to make sure these would be good.  They are FANTASTIC!  I lined my 9x13" baking pan with parchment paper.  I also used 1/2 cup butter with the graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  When pressing the crust mixture out, I was afraid it would be too dry and thin, but it worked well.  Baked at 350 for 9 minutes, and it was perfect.  Doubled the toffee ingredients, and let boil about 30 seconds (this seemed to be a major problem with folks).  Added a touch of vanilla after taking the toffee off heat.  Spreading the toffee was no problem; baked 10 minutes.  Covered the top with 2 cups chocolate chips and put back into the oven for 1 minute.  I had some concern when some of the chips sank into the toffee, but for the most part they spread beautifully.  Topped with toasted sliced almonds and let cool.  To remove, I just grasped the edges of the paper and it lifted right out.  I cut into bars, then lifted the paper back into the baking pan, covered it with plastic and put in the refrigerator.  Of course, I had to have a sample ;-) - just like an Almond Roca!  I will definitely make these again, and I think I'll try using Ritz crackers, as salted caramel seems to be so big these days.  Wonderful recipe!

Awesome....followed the advise on doubling the toffee layer and used almost a whole bag of chocolate chips.  Brought to a groom's dinner and now I owe my aunt a whole pan to herself!!

This SHOULD have been good but was not.  First, the directions for the graham cracker crust were all wrong.  There is not enough butter to make the crust form, and the cracker crumbs stayed just that... cracker crumbs... and did not adhere to the bottom of the toffee.  So much for giving this as a gift.

Secondly, there was not enough toffee to cover the crumbs.  It was a mess trying to spread it to the edges and I was not able to get any toffee into a couple of the corners.

Third, the completed bars were WAY TOO SWEET -- and I like sweet things, but this was sickly.  The graham cracker crust with the brown sugar put it over the top.  It would be much better with more of a minimally-sweetened shortbread base.  More cookie-like and not sweet and crumbly.

I can't give this away along with my other Christmas cookies this year so am looking for a better recipe.

These are always a big hit whenever I make them.  The smaller the bite the better, very rich dessert.  I cut them when they are still warm then recut along the same lines once they are cooled (less breakage).  Much better the second day after being in the fridge.  I also added some butterscotch chips to them because I had them around and these made them REDONKULOUS.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used non=stick foil to cover my pan and just lifted it out.  It cuts very easily into small square bars.  It got rave reviews. I highly recommend it.

Tasty recipe, but judging the recipe as it's written it doesn't deserve 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and although the bars were good, half of the crumb mixture was left as crumbs in the pan. Will add more butter to the crust next time, as suggested.  And, I will double the toffee as suggested by other reviewers because it was a little skimpy.  I will also cut them before completely cool so they don't break (which they did).  That said, the bars were good enough to give the revised recipe another try.

These crunch bars are great but it's a lot easier if you melt the chocolate chips first.  When I tried to just sprinkle them and wait for them to melt, it didn't work or look very good.

These were not quite as good as I thought something with large amounts of butter, sugar,  chocolate, and nuts should be. :) Even my husband, who loves all those ingredients, just said that they were good. We prefer the toffee crunch with graham crackers.

i baked this 2 days ago.. I must say on the day I baked it.. it was way too sweet for my taste and decided not to do it again. However, the following day they tasted just great :) I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crackers to add a hint of taste.  
However next time I would do the following changes. 
Put the crackers and butter in a food processor since even tiny sized crackers won't hold well. 
I would decrease the amount of sugar put with the crackers. 
I would boil the sugar and butter mix for half a minute only.
I would prebake the crust for only 5 mins
I would add more than a cup of chocochips 

But overall, its an amazing recipe and very easy to do.

These were so easy to make and everyone loved them! It took a while for the toffee to boil for me with constant stirring, but I let it go for about 45 seconds once it started. Perfect!

These are great! Like little candy bars. I was scared to let them cool in the pan before cutting so I gave myself some insurance. The only thing I did differently was cutting them in the pan when they were only half cooled, loosening the sides, removing a slim row from one short side of the pan so I would have an easy place to slip a spatula under the bars (and steal a taste ;-) ) and putting them in the fridge to finish firming up.

Delicious!  These would be perfect for cookie or dessert trays during the holidays.  They very much remind me of toffee, but so much easier to make.  I only made 1/2 a batch and put into an 8X8 pan, and we still ended up with plenty of pieces.

This is SO delicious and simple to make.  Like many others, I used 1/2 cup butter with the graham cracker crumbs (to make the crumbs stay together) - and doubled the toffee filling.  I've made three pans of this and each one came out perfectly, following the cooking directions as written.  Wonderful gift to put in a Christmas tin (if they last that long!).  This is a keeper!

I made this without any substitutions, I didn't think it was fair to rate it with making changes, however, all along I knew I should have been.
The graham crust was a disaster.  It needed double the butter to hold together.  It was a crumbly mess, but I got it pressed into the pan.  There was no where near enough toffee and I could not spread it because the graham cracker layer would come up with it.  I finished it and in the end, even though it flopped, my husband and I could pick up the chocolate and toffee with some some graham stuck to it and it tasted great, just like a Skor bar.  With some tweaking: double the butter in the crust and 1 and 1/2 the times of the toffee layer, I think it has potential.

Really yummy.  Other reviewers commented that there was too much grahm and too little toffee taste.  I agreed with this an hour after I took them out of the oven, but when I had another piece the following morning, the taste had gotten even better.  The grahm became less overpowering and the toffee flavor came out a lot more after sitting over night.

I think it would have helped if I had used a blender/food processer to crush the graham crackers. It doesn't stick together if there are lumps. I may have cooked the br. sugar/butter too long because there was not enough to cover the crumbs. I also think more chocolate chips would be a good idea. I usually adjust recipes to taste and this one requires that it be followed too closely for me. I was disappointed that it doesn't taste like toffee at all--more like s'mores.

I felt there were too many cracker crumbs making the crust unnecessarily thick.  The brown sugar and butter only need a few seconds of stirring and then remove from heat.  If you cook for a minute as the recipe says, the butter will burn.  When I poured this 1/2 cup mixture onto the cracker crust, I had to push it with a spoon to barely get it to reach the edges, and felt it was too thin.  I made this recipe before I read the reviews.  Then checked the reviews and discovered others had run into the same problems.  I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.

I've made this recipe for over 25 years with just one change. I use soda crackers instead of graham Crackers. The toffee is lighter, is a little saltier, which goes great with the sweetness, and the cracker taste doesn't fight the toffee taste.

For our tastes it was MUCH too sweet, but the people we made it for loved it, I still get compliments on this. It is definitely very candy-like. Would be nice for Christmas.

These went so quickly at my holiday party! I did as others suggested and took it off the heat as soon as it came to a boil, and then cut them before they cooled.  They definatly need to sit overnight, as they taste alot better the next day.

Oh my gosh!! These are so good! I made them in a 8x8 pan and reduced the amount of graham crackers and kept the other ingredients the same (only because there are only two of us and I didn't want a whole 13x9 pan to tempt me) I put the pan in the freezer for 20 min. right after I spread the chocolate over the top and they were perfect to cut. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were easy and fast to make, but as some others have been saying i had to double the toffee amount. After letting them cool in the fridge i tried them and found them to taste kind of "grainy" I realized that texture came from the graham crackers, so my advise is to very finely chop your graham cracker crust and if needed add a little more butter, other than that this recipe is great!

These are very tasty bars. I made them pretty much exactly as written, except that I lined the bottom of my pan with Reynold's Release non-stick foil so that I could easily lift the bars out of the pan for even, clean cutting. Nearly everyone who tried these liked them...they are very tasty. I felt they were a bit too sweet, though. Not sure if I'll make them again, but they were pretty good!

I took this dessert to a BBQ and everyone raved about it!  After reading the reviews, I doubled the toffee layer, but it is a little gritty.  Maybe I didn't boil it long enough?  (20 seconds, should have gone one minute) Or it needed to bake longer? I added 1/2 cup of butter to the crust, which was perfect. I'll keep trying because the taste was fantastic!

These are really good! I increased the butter for graham crackers and doubled the toffee. Also, I'm allergic to nuts so I smashed some Christmas M&M's and pretzels to sprinkle on top-festive and tasty!

These tasty treats are a favorite of my Daughter-in-law and have become a holiday tradition in our family. I always use 1/2 cup of butter in the crust but this year I forgot and only used 1/3 cup... OOPS! Be sure to really press the crust into the pan quite firmly and make them a day ahead of time, they'll set up and cut better. These don't always cut into perfect bars, there is always a bit of crumbling but hey they are homemade... and homemade always taste the best. If you want something that looks bakery made... I suggest you go to the bakery...LOL

This was easy to make and sooo delicious. I made this 2 nights ago for co-workers and am making it again tonight for a cookie exchange party. I read reviews stating there was too much graham cracker so I decided to double the amount of toffee filling. After the bars were mostly "set" I cut them then refridgerated them to help the chocolate on top to harden. The next morning it was easy to re-cut the bars on the lines I had made the night before without the bars crumbling into pieces.

These were extremely good! I doubled the toffee recipe as others suggested. I usually make something similar with a cracker crust and skor pieces on top but I think this is much better. I am going to try it with the skor pieces on top next time.

Holy toffee!  Never have to buy this again!  I only made half the recipe but kept the amount of toffee the same as the original recipe and used chopped almonds instead of walnuts.  They look professional and taste great!  I will be boxing these up for the holidays along with my other bars to give away :)

These are great! I liked them, my kids liked them... yum. A hit for all chocolate lovers. I added them to a "tea time" gift basket along with biscotti, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. I think they made a nice addition. The only problem I had with them is that a few hours later several parts of the pan had solidified to the point where I could break the bars apart with the perforated edge my knife had made - and other parts were still chewy. Just wish the whole pan had turned out the same texture, but that's probably my fault due to dough flattening abilities. lol. Yummy, easy treat.

This was really good. It tasted like a Skor or Heath candy bar to me. I doubled the toffee part as suggested by other reviewers, and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe was awesome!!! However, when I was done with the bars, I couldn't get the bars our without losing some crust. Maybe next time, grease the baking sheet lightly. The caramel layer should be at least doubled or tripled, because I can't taste the Carmel layer that took so much work to make... I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I believe that it tastes much better than the average walnut. I added a whole bag of chocolate chips and I think that's the perfect amount. I am making it for the Lakewood police officers who suffered their loss of a coworker. I hope that cops like toffee bars instead I'd the classic doughnut!!

I'm very glad I chose to make this for my Christmas assortment. I didn't have gram crackers so I used ritz. Gives it a nice salty / sweet taste. This is a keeper & so easy -( I did double the brown sugar mixture - I don't know how you get the original amount to cover a 9x 13 size)

These were DELISH!!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is increase the butter in the graham cracker layer to 1/2 c.  The bottom layer didn't hold together completely.  Fantastic!

I just made these. Very very good.  However, not the best toffee bar recipe I have tried.  The measurements were a little off...I needed a lot more crust and toffee.  Also the toffee sinks to the bottom and it becomes one big gooey glop. But overall, I will try this again.

This had a wonderful taste and my kids loved it.  However, the graham cracker layer just fell apart, so it definitely needs more butter.  Also, I would increase the amount of the toffee layer.

This was delicious!  I don't cook much, but have been trying to do different meals and desserts recently.  This was pretty darn easy!  Though I would say that doubling the toffee and the chocolate layer is a good idea.  Otherwise they are way too thin.  In addition to that, I let it boil less than a minute (about 30 seconds) and it came out perfect.  The only thing was that I had trouble getting it out of the pan.  It just fell apart (even after I let it cool in the fridge for a bit).  Still tasty though!

These are excellent and fairly easy to make. The next time I make them I would double the crust & double the toffee. Then again, if you make it thin it is less fattening! Delicious!!!

I used whole graham crackers for the crust, and poured the toffee over that, and then followed the directions of the original recipe.  It is even quicker to do it this way.

These are absolutely delicious. I couldn't decide if I should double the toffee layer so I did one and a half. I think next time I'll probably double it. Regardless these were amazing. They were gone within 12 hours.

I wasn't sure how to rate this one. My husband loved it so much he took some to work the next day to share with his staff. I on the other hand got sick to my stomach after eating a small piece because it was so rich. It tasted soooo good but it is really super sweet. I doubbled the filling like othersa suggested so maybe I would have been better off sticking to the recipe. Seemed like it was mising the crunch factor. I had to add more butter to the crust. It would have been a crumbly mess if made according to the recipe.

Really yummy! followed others advice about less graham cracker crumbs and doubled the toffee.  boiled the mixture for 30 seconds.  bars were not quite set when i took them out of the oven,so I  added the choc chips to the top after about 10 minutes  and just kind of lightly spread them out, sprinkled with toasted sliced almonds.  i let them rest over night and they cut like a dream and tasted amazing.  Definately will make again and again!!!

I made this and doubled the amount of toffee and it was AMAZING.  My family doesn't like nuts so I sprinkled little bits of heath bar over the chocolate.  I let it boil for a whole minute and it did not burn at all.  THANKS for this recipe, it's my new Favourite.

Very good. I omitted the walnuts and there was still plenty of crunch. The graham cracker base was a bit crumbly, and next time I will add a bit more butter to ensure that it is solid. I also would consider doubling the amount of butter/sugar filling to add more toffee flavour. the recipe was great without these additions, but it is also one that will be fun to play around with.

I followed the recipe as stated with excellent results. I used 11 graham cracker "sheets" to make 2 cups of crumbs. I was expecting the bars to be thicker; maybe next time I will use a 9x9 pan.  I might also try doubling the toffee sauce as others suggested.  Thanks for the recipe, Pamela and Victoria!

As per other reviewers, I reduced the graham crackers by 1/2 cup.  Everybody at the poker party loved these bars, but I was expecting more toffee crunch to them.  Good flavor, but the texture was lacking.  If I'm craving toffee, I'll stick to making just toffee.

Wonderful recipe.  I suggest swirling the brown sugar butter mixture over the crackers crust, rather than spreading it with a spatula.  This will keep them nice and separate.

Everyone loved this so much! To make it festive looking for Christmas, instead of walnuts on top, I sprinkle crushed candy canes, which also gives it a hint of peppermint flavor with some nice crunch!

These were pretty good.  Nice mix of graham, toffee, and chocolate  flavours.  The only thing is that I'd like a bit less crust and a bit more toffee.  I also added a bit more chocolate chips than was called for, because I was hesitant about being able to spread only one cup of chocolate over the bars without making a mess.  Very tasty overall though, and I think I'd make them again!

This recipe was ok.  Other reviews said it was too dry so I used 1/2 c. butter with the graham crackers.  I was a little surprised since I expected the brown sugar and butter to make a layer on top of the graham cracker crust.  However, they all kind of combined together.  Don't know if that was supposed to happen.

These came out slightly crumbly for me (I may have overcooked them), which made cutting them into bars impossible. I had to break them into random sized pieces, which ended up adding to their appeal. I didn't spread the chocolate chips ontop, instead I left them whole (plus I used slightly more than the recipe says) and sprinkled with almonds as another reviewer suggested. These disappeared quickly.

So easy!

I used a whole bag of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter for the crust. I've made these before and the extra butter was well worth it!

everyone loved it at work. used parchment paper.  added salt in the graham crackers melted unsalted butter sugar mix. added salt in the butter sugar toffee and used candy thermometer up to soft crack temp 275F and then placed in oven as instructed. Tip: cut or score the toffee in squares serving size when the chocolate had spread prior to chilling it so that when youre ready to serve, just lift the parchment paper and it will break with uniform squares

I tried it out to see how they were because I loved my aunts Toffee crunch bars when I was little. This recipe is surprisingly easy. I love the bars and I am a very picky eater. The flavour is just great and have that good toffee crunch that I asked from these bars. Thanks for the recipe ;)

I had made this years ago and lost the recipe. It  was a crowd pleaser then and now. I made 3 cookie sheets and at the end ran out of brown sugar. I quickly mixed 3/4 cup white sugar with 1/4 cup dark Karo syrup. It worked perfectly. Not  gritty, completely smooth. Only I knew the  difference.

I followed the recipe exactly and good thing I checked after the last 8 minutes in the oven as smoke was coming out.  But it still tasted burnt and the butter had separated from the sugar so the bottom of it looked marbled.  There is nothing chocolaty my 13 year old doesn't like, except this.  I'll still with the traditional white sugar no graham cracker recipe that has worked without fail.

I used a thicker base of graham cracker crumbs, powdered in the food processor as one of the reviewers suggested. Also doubled the caramel filling. It set wonderfully, just remember to score it before letting it cool completely.

I sooo wanted this to work but the graham cracker crust broke up and crumbled badly. MY husband ate a bowl full that didn't stick to the crunch bars. I had to freeze them to get them to stay together. I followed the directions, but doubled the toffee mixture. Maybe tomorrow I will be more impressed.

These are amazing. You will need to double the filling as everyone else noted. I think they would be even better with a firmer chocolate layer.

I thought these were good, not great. My Mother thought great. To each his own. Mine were a little softer than the hard toffee I'm use to. You can also make with milk chocolate and or almonds and it's equally good.

I'm not sure if there was not enough butter in the crust, or enough 'toffee' topping, but the outside inch of the crust did not hold together.  The middle could be cut up and served, the edges fell a part.  Still tasted good, just couldn't serve the whole pan.

Not really impressed with this recipe.  It's not just wonderful or totally horrible.  I think it's the graham crust that is a little "different".

Oops!  Help!  I loved these last time I made them.  But, this time, I could not get the butter and brown sugar to "melt."  It stayed gritty.  I had water boiling for pasta on the stove and it was a very hot day.  Could that have anything to do with it?  I cooked the mix for longer than 1 min, but it started to scorch and still wasn't melty.  They were still delicious, however!

I love toffee and this recipe is easy to put together.  It tastes really good, too.  It's hard to go wrong with that much butter.  But it takes at least 20 minutes in the freezer to get the crust and chocolate to harden up enough to be able to dish it out of the pan.  And finding room in my freezer for a whole pan of bars is no small task.

Yum!  I'm almost finished with my Easter cookie platters, and at the last second, I decided I needed to add more chocolate and a bar cookie, and this filled both requirements!  Since I was making them for the first time, I decided to stick to the original recipe, with the exception of the chocolate- I added a whole bag of those.  I didn't have any trouble with the toffee as some other reviewers said, and in fact I think I boiled it a bit longer than one minute and it came out great.  Next time I will add more toffee!  Thanks for the recipe ladies!

This is a VERY yummy treat!  I only gave it a 4 star because it is extremely difficult to remove from the pan and cut.  For that reason I will probably stick to my old recipe for toffee.  Thanks

Not quite was I was expecting, but this was a very good bar recipe. My fiancee loved it and wants me to make it again so he can take it in to the office.

I made these for my husband's card night and they were gone almost immediately.  I had to make them a second time so I could try one.  They are fabulous and will make again.

Good flavor, next time I will try doubling the toffee layer as others have said, but was a bit disappointed that it sunk into the crust.  The crust was also way too crumbly and dry, does need more butter or less graham crumbs.  Used Skor bits on top instead of nuts. Found the 1 cup of chocolate to be a good proportion, and spread nicely.    But good to fix a sweet craving without a lot of hassle.  Thanks.

Yummy! Easy! Deliciouso!!!  I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was to put toffee pieces on top instead of nuts.

These bars were easy to make and delicious!  I was going to double the toffee part as others suggested, and I actually forgot to.  They still tasted great!  I did follow others' advice and removed the toffee from the heat as soon as it came to a boil instead of boiling for a whole minute.  We'll definitely make these again.

I personally did not care for these because I found them to be very dry. My husband and son liked the flavor. I most likely won't make again.

My friend made these Chocolate Toffee Crunch Bars last night for desert.  Can you say YUMMMMM!  She used ½ cup butter and the full bag of chocolate chips.  We started eating them before they set and they were chocolate gooey goodness with a crunch; they later set and were just as good!

I enjoyed this recipe although I found that there were too many graham crumbs for my liking. Next time I'll put in less. Overall enjoyed by everyone, a great recipe to have!

This recipe is so easy and so fast. I needed something quick to take to family I was visiting out of town. These bars were so good. I chopped up chocolate covered peanuts to put on the top of the bars. Pamela & Victoria, outstanding, simple recipe. Thank You

The taste is great, however, I had to make a couple of adjustments to this recipe.  First, the crust was too crumbly, so I increased the butter used in the crust to 1/2 cup.  I also added more chocolate chips for the topping.

I used almonds instead which was good but I found the graham cracker crust to be a little overpowering. However, if you like g.cracker crust then this is the recipe for you! I think I will try a shortbread crust next time??
