This was exactly what I needed for my chicken. I made triple the amount and stirred it in with the chicken.  It tasted great.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious sauce you can make in 1 minute. I didn't have regular mustard, only spicy brown mustard and it was veerrrry good. We had it with grilled burgers and homemade French fries. Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe!

I had reservations at first but I just can't seem to get enough of this stuff. It's been great on everything I've tried it on thus far. Needless to say it had quickly become a condiment staple. thank you for this simple and wonderful recipe!

I was looking for a quick sauce to serve with our sliders tonight and thought I would give this a try.  I tried it as the recipe was written and it was a little too sweet for our taste.  I added some more light mayo and mustard to help balance out the flavor.  It was just ok for us.

Wonderful!! I was a bit skeptical, the combination just didn't sound very appealing, plus I don't put mustard on my burgers, I use mayo and ketchup.
But I was pleasantly surprised. This elevated simple onion soup mix burgers with homemade buns to something that would put most restaurants to shame. Never in my life have I had a better burger.

The taste reminded me a bit of BigMac sauce.

It's delicious and I will not put anything else on my burgers anymore.

I only gave 3 stars as I changed the recipe slightly. I did however appreciate the idea for this combination. I used spicy brown mustard, only 1 tsp of sugar and about a tsp of rice vinegar (unseasoned). I wanted a looser dressing rather than a spread. I will in the future try this exact recipe but will still reduce the amount of sugar.

This sauce is so good.  We use it on everything from fries to chicken.  I love it on homemade onion rings!!!  It taste like a sweet honey mustard

I just had the best hot dog ever. This sauce went so well on it. I also dipped it in my fries. Thank you so much for the great recipe.
