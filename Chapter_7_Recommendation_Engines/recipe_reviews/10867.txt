These cookies were really dry. Must have drunk a gallon of milk eating the first batch.

I made these cookies with chocolate chips.  They taste great, with a delicious hint of cinnamon; unfortunately, I found them to be very dry.  Next time I think I'll add a bit of oil or applesauce to offset this problem, because they are tasty.

These cookies rose too high and were very dry. My husband told me never to make them again.

These cookies are great! Soft and chewy. I make these all the time and they turn out perfect everytime I make them! I don't think they are dry at all like the others are saying! I've had more then a few people ask me for the recipe. Highly recommended!

Despite what she named her cookie, the contributor omits the cup of raisins she credits with winning her a second place red ribbon. The raisins might compensate for the fact only 1/3 of the sugar of your standard cookie recipe is called for, hence the result tastes like crackers not cookies.

I, too, wish I had read the reviews.  This is a dry, tasteless cookie.  They need more sugar. They have a nice texture, but no taste.

These were amazing cookies, I had several family members and friends come over throughout the week. They stayed soft and gooey, (I used dark chocolate chips.) Everyone that tried them. loved them. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I will be using this cookie recipe in my christmas baskets. GREAT JOB LIZ:}

I wish that I had read the review before I made these cookies.  They are dry and really no flavor.

Very dry and tasteless. I had to throw them all out.  I was in a hurry so I did not read the reviews. Lesson learned...

Tried this recipe with M&Ms instead of raisins or nuts.  They tasted really good but fell apart, or crumbled, easily.  Used butter for shortening and followed recipe.  Will try again putting M&Ms on top of dropped cookie dough and see if they hold up better.
