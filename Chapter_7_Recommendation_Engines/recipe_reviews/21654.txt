My great-grandma's family moved here from Russia after leaving Germany.  This recipe is very similar to the delicious butterball soup she used to make.  She used all spice and chicken stock, both of which add A LOT more flavor.  She didn't have a written recipe, making it hard to duplicate.  I made some for her last year and she approved.  :)

My grandmother in law used to make these every Easter for our family dinner. The literally melt in your mouth like butter. So good!! She passed away before any of us had the chance to get the exact recipe. This one is darn near perfect to hers. Thanks so much for posting so I can continue to share this tasty dish with my children and some day grandchildren.

Butterballs are my family's biggest food tradition. Every holiday it is the dinner meal. This is a bit different from our recipe but close and good as well.

Ok, so I knew that this wasn't going to be a taste sensation, but it was pretty good considering it was so cheap and easy to make. I think, however, that making it with homemade chicken broth and throwing in a few veggies, this could be a really great soup. Thanks!

Nice way to use old bread!
They remind me of an italian tipical dish form the north called "canederli"... 
I used sesame seed bread and the taste was very nice. I preferred oil to butter. Thank you!

Both my grandmothers were German/Russian and this was a family staple after Thanksgiving and Christmas as we made it with turkey broth and homemade egg noodles sliced VERY thin along with the dumplings.  This is a pretty good version, but would never taste like Grandma's ;)

These dumplings are great!  I used whole grain bread and white bread that I had leftover.   I used my own chicken stock and added some carrots!  Yummy!  I might add some chicken next time.

I did not care for this much. It was like soggy bread to me but maybe I didn't make it right. On the other hand, my husband ate it all up.

I substituted wheat bread for the white and allspice for the pepper.  Then they tasted exactly like my great grandmother's.  I'm so glad I found this recipe.

If you add a bit of allspice to these, they become like the traditional soup of Volga River Germans.

Iâ€™m so glad I tried these! I made coarse bread crumbs in the food processor, crusts and all. My butter was half melted because I over softened it in the microwave and I used an extra large egg, so that probably gave some extra glue to compensate for the fact that I kept the crusts on. It came together easily in Kitchenaid with the kneading paddle. They cooked in about four minutes in a pot of leftover chicken broth to which I added leftover bits of chicken at the end. What an easy and quick way to use up stale bread. Thanks for the recipe!
