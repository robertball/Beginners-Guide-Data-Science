These cookies are excellent! So easy to prepare the main batch and store it. I divided mine up and sealed in a food saver bag. I just took a bag out of the freezer a month later and made the cookies and they turned out perfect! So easy!

Being lactose intollerant it can be hard to find a good recipe for sweets. This one is awesome. It's also a good base recipe to play with. I've added cinnamon cocoa nutmeg and so far have yet made a bad cookie with this recipe. The only word of warning would be that it _may_ not store great for the 8 months mentioned. It will still make great cookies but the longer it sits it will lose something in the end result. But that's not the fault of the recipe. Thanks for this recipe!

Glasswalker I hope it was a typo you wrote and you meant weeks not months! LOL. I did not have chocolate chips so I chopped up a chocolate bar that had white chocolate in it! Yum

Ha! This is hilarious. I didn't really "read" the directions. I copied the ingredients and then thinking I know how to bake I just started combining them. I thought the mix was really dry (go figure!) and so I added enough applesauce to make it sticky moist. I added raisins and ground flaxseed and baked them. They came out wonderfully - and so good for you too! Thank you!

I really enjoyed making these cookies. Very easy recipe to follow...the first batch I made was with white chocolate chips...and everyone at work loved them. Next time I will do a variety of mixes.:)

These cookies are so yummy! I added raisins but instead of a whole cup I only used a half cup. I've been looking for a good oatmeal raisin cookie recipe for a few years now. Finally I've found one that is really good. Thank you!

These cookies tasted good but looked so bad I couldn't serve them to company! I read and reread the directions to make sure I was following exactly and had no luck.

Fun recipe I like that a big part is done for next time. However I used butter so I'll keep mine in the fridge. The only thing I would do differently is next time I'll add some spices. This is definitely a recipe to build upon!
