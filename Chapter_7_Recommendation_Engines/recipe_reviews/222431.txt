a nice change from remade pasta salad dressing and a great way to use up a bag of avacados.  Really enjoyed this even w/o dill

This recipe was really good! My husband and I love avocado and this sauce uses just enough avocado perfectly! I did not use any substitutions and it was perfect. Just the right amount of creamy, crunchy, with a zing from the limes! Yummy!!

Not too bad.  We added some feta cheese to add a little more saltiness to it.  I also added more garlic powder, about another tsp.

I make this exactly as directed and I love love love it. So healthy tasting and bueatiful. Make sure to only use half the box of pasta otherwise it will taste nothing like its supposed to. I didnt make that mistake but someone I passed the recipe on to did. Thank you so much for posting this.

I added 2 tsp. sugar because it seemed a little bitter.  The salad was better the second day after marinating.  It had a good, unique taste, and it was a fun variation on a pasta salad. It kept in the fridge well for at least 3 days.

I love avocados so I really should have liked this recipe.  Sadly i did not.  I felt that it was really bland and had little to no flavor at all.  I won't be making this again.

I made this for a pot luck. I absolutely love it and it's now going on to my favourites for large gatherings list. There's just two of us so the original recipe is too much but great for tomorrow. The only thing I changed was I used 1 tsp garlic powder but that's cause I like garlic. I don't think it made a difference. Would still have been great as is.

This was such a great change from the usual bland mayo pasta salads. I brought it to a party (although after tasting it at home I wanted to keep it all for myself!) and it got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have parsley for garnish, but it should definitely be flexible to subbing in veggies and proteins to suit your taste.  Depending on  your tastes you may need more salt to bring out the flavors; I generally don't use much salt and I was happy with the recipe amount.

I took note of another reviewer's comment being bland so I added basil rather than dill, a tbsp of olive oil, a tbsp of white wine vinegar and a generous (heaped) tsp of dijon mustard - much better.

I used the basic recipe but added smoked paprika, Adobo and chicken tenders that were seasoned with salt, Adobo, lime zest and juice from 2 additional limes. The reduced lime juice from the chicken added so much extra flavor that I left out the cheese. Will absolutely make this again!
