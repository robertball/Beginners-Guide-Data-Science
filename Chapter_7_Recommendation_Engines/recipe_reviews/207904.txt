I made this dish to go along with a turkey dinner we had tonight.  I mixed it up last night (except the corn flakes...I added those in right before I baked it) to save time today.  I followed the recipe exactly except, I was cooking for only 4 people, so I halved the recipe and put it in an 11x7 casserole dish instead of a ring mold.  Everyone loved it!  It was very tasty and a nice change from the same ole, same ole.  The only thing I would recommend is to run the carrots through a food processor instead of a mixer.  Much easier and quicker that way.  Otherwise, it was very easy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I'll be making it again for Thanksgiving.

Wow - this was a great recipe! I tried this with the small bundt cake pan and while it did not come out as smooth as I would have liked, it tasted great. Need to make sure you really grease the pan in order to come out cleanly.
