I made this tonight and it was amazing.  I used dried thyme instead of fresh, honeycrisp apples that I had on hand Instead of granny smith apples, and I added a splash or two of balsamic vinegar to the apples and onions just before adding the butter.  I also left the skins on the apples instead of peeling them.  My husband demanded that it be added to our regular rotation.

I made a half recipe with only a one pound tenderloin. I used one Granny Smith apple and half a red onion.  Since I don't like thyme much, I sprinkled on very little, but it was still too much. Next time, I won't use it, but everything else was good.

Excellent flavor!  pork was tender. Apple, onion + stuff was wonderful; sweet but not overly.  Served with white rice.  My dinners are never quite as photogenic.  Followed the original recipe; only modification was making a half batch.  Will definitely make again!

The only changes I made were to use the apples I had on hand - gala, unpeeled and adding 2 dollops of balsamic vinegar as suggested by another reviewer. I think that really added to the depth of the sauce. We loved it.

This was very yummy! I plan to make it again, but with more Dijon,  as I thought that flavor was lost in the shuffle, so to speak . It would work as a weeknight dinner but paired with a nice salad and a veggie and you've got a nice hearty fall Sunday dinner.

10.6.19  My pork tender was on the small side, and I should have checked the temperature at 12 minutes and not waited until 15.  Although not beautifully pink in the center, it was just a bit overcooked, but still plenty juicy and tender.  The apples turned out a bit mushy and in the future I will take the recipe submitterâ€™s suggestion to use Golden Delicious, but the flavor was spot on.  The skillet was pretty dry when it came out of the oven and even after adding the chicken broth, so I stirred in a splash of apple cider to the apple-onion mixture and warmed up before I added the butter at the end.  Clearly written, detailed recipe instructions and a tasty Sunday dinner.
