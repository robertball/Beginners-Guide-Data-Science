This is a tasty, healthy and economical family meal. We loved it!   I used 2 cups cottage cheese mixed with 2 beaten eggs instead of gaucamole.  It gave the dish a nice, creamy texture and flavor without the cost and trouble of the avocados.  Will definitely make again!

If I could, I would give this 4.5 stars.  It was really good, and the best part was that this vegetarian and healthy dish was a big hit with my meat-loving husband.  I halved the recipe, so instead of using the can of tomatoes and salsa, I substitued a can of tomatoes with diced chilis.  I also added about 1 t red pepper flakes to make sure it was hot enough (boy, was it!).  I really liked this combination; the guacamole was a creative and good addition.  I will put this in the regular rotation of meat-free meals.

This turned out really well. The corn tortillas give the lasagna a nice taste and texture compared to lasagna noodles. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used fresh tomatoes and added one jalepeno pepper. Next time, I will add some cumin or other spices to the black bean mixture. I will also double the guacamole. Also, I found it was easier to layer the pan with halved, rather than quartered, tortillas. Overall, very good. I will make it again.

Very good!  I did add cumin, chili powder, cilantro and some red pepper and garlic seasoning (because I only had green peppers to add to the lasagna).  I also used a can of rotel tomatoes with the chile peppers and threw in about a cup of frozen corn.  I'll make this one again for sure...only next time I would like to mash the black beans, mix them with some light sour cream and spread the mixture onto the tortillas before layering - I think that would add a lot...then serve the  guac on the side.  Thanks much - great meal that is cheap to make and pretty healthy.

Awesome recipe! As a second generation Mexican, I pride myself in cooking "authentic" Mexican dishes; so naturally I was skeptical about the concept behind this dish. But I found myself in a bind when I agreed to have friends over for a Mexican dinner, and remembered that one was a vegetarian. Coming from the carnivorous backgroud that I have, I thought it would be impossible to cook a tasty veggie Mexican dish (other than boring quesadillas). I was more than pleasantly surprised when I made this dish and was proven wrong. The flavors of all the vegetables marry so well together, and the combination of the cheese and guacamole add the perfect touch. I'll be proudly serving this for Cinco de Mayo. As my husband put it, "Screw it if it's not authentic. It tastes amazing!". =)

I am totally at a loss as to why this recipe has received so many positive reviews, I did not care for it!  I followed the recipe exactly and what I ended up with had a very mushy, yucky consistency and the combination of avocados and black beans made the whole thing look (and taste) very unappealing.  Obviously, there are people out there who liked it, so if you simply cannot resist the urge to make this I would definitely recommend you at least use flour tortillas instead of corn.

My family has almost the same recipe, except we don't use any guac, and we use Monterey Jack instead of cheddar. We put the bean/tomatoes down first, then tortillas, then more bean/tomatoes, more tortillas and top it with fresh tomatoes, adding more cheese and cilantro in the last 5 minutes of baking. It's a great vegetarian dish that everyone loves. And as you can see by my review, it's quite versatile. You can add corn and jalapenos too.

This was fantastic!  Altered it just a little per other suggestions, one layer of guac and one layer of sour cream as well as extra cheese.  Threw in some cilantro and a little chili powder.  I wasn't sure about how it would be with the guacamole cooked but it was great!  Very glad I had the layer of sour cream as well.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was excellent!  I added a green chili, zuccini and a yellow squash (chopped into small pieces) to the black bean tomato mixture, as well as cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes for some extra spice.  Since there wasn't enough guacamole I used sour cream for the second laye.  I highly recommend the sour cream addition, it was excellent.

Thanks for the great recipe!

We thought this was very yummy & reasonably healthy. I couldn't manage to make 2 layers out of the amount of guacamole this made, but it was fine with just one layer. We'll be making this regularly!

Really good recipe. Hubby actually tried a bite and said it was good...boy was I shocked. But I had already made him something different. The only 2 changes I made, one was because I had no choice, I didn't do the avocado, and to my disappointment over it, the brown things were hard as a brick so I had to omit them and lemon juice. BUT I was able to make a salsa verde & sour cream mixture with the remaining garlic in it's place and it was pretty good. The 2nd was quartering the tortillas. To me waste of time, because I then have to count out all the little pieces to each layer and then I find they don't over lap or lay evenly in the pan without looking like slop when I try and remove from the pan (no offense, that's just me). But I ended up just using a few more corn tortillas then what it's called for. I used 18 (6 per layer) If it's going to be called a lasagna, I like it too look something like one. However, again that's me. It was a great smelling and flavorful recipe. The veggies aromatics saute'ing in the pan was delightful. Almost reminded me of a veggie tamale with the taste. And  that's a great thing. I'll make again using the avocado. The avocado just bit the bucket this round. My girls both had 2nd helpings a piece. TY.

Wow-soooo good! Yes, yes, I made a couple changes based on what I had available-sour cream in place of guacamole/avocados & rotel tomatoes. I added 1 can of chili beans, 1 tsp cumin, & 1 tsp of chili powder. Even my kids(except for 1 extremely picky one) devoured it! I'll definately be making this again & again & will try it w/the guacamole next time cuz I love it!

My husband and I really likes this dish. Next time I make it I am going to use 3 avacados and add sour cream to the avacado mash. I think it will give it more flavor and "spread" easier. I used more cheese than the recipe call for, but you can never have too much cheese. Overall a very good dinner...

One of my allrecipe faves! Easy to make, inexpensive, and great for potlucks. My only suggestion: ditch the canned black beans and make your own from scratch. Homemade beans have so much more flavor and a firmer (less mushy) texture. I often will make a crock pot full and freeze in two cup containers. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! I used flour tortillas and Mexican-blend cheese instead of cheddar; I also added the avocado afterwards because I'm not too fond of warm avocado.  I will definitely use this recipe again, it's very easy and turns out great! For the salsa I used a chipotle-flavored kind and that gave it great flavor.

Delicious.  I used jarred garlic (easier to keep around the house and it stays fresh in the fridge).  I mixed plain yogurt with my avocado to give it a creamy consistency but left out the garlic and lemon.  I used more cheese, of course.  Wow, my 2 1/2 year old scarfed it down.  I ate leftovers 2 days later and it was still delicious.

I really liked this recipe!  It was a good foundation for making a Mexican lasagna, but very easy to tweak to your personal tastes.  I didn't have any salsa on hand, my chopped tomatoes were flavoured with oregano and black olives, I only had flour tortillas, and I blended the avocado with a little cream cheese to help it spread just that little bit further.  And I know it negates the meat free option, but I added a bit of chopped chicken I was trying to get rid of.  I cheated by not quartering the tortillas and just using a round dish, making it more pizza like when divying it up.  I'd recommed adding some cumin at some point, as well, to enhance that Mexican flavour.

Excellent!  I added a few shakes of cumin and used tomatoes with chilis, which gave it a nice kick.  I also used vegan cheese instead of regular cheese (for obvious reasons).  Will definitely make again!

Added cumin and chili powder to beans, based on other reviews. Skipped the guacamole but included a diced zucchini just to get more veggies in there. We loved how the layers stayed in a stack just like a "real" lasagna. Will definitely make this again.

In retrospect Im not sure what I expected from this but it was to much of a conglomerate casserole.  The tortillas soaked up all the juice leaving it dry.  It lacked spice, and I even added green chilies.  I would reccomend adding a green chilie enchilada sauce and using flour tortillas instead.  This reminded me to much of a frumpy potluck dinner!

I personally really enjoyed it (and my 1 yr old and husband too).  The lasagna itself did really hold together which surprised me, but we did make sure to cook off the liquid before putting it in the lasagna pan.  I didn't find corn tortillas, we used wheat and still enjoyed it.  It will be a regular.

I followed the recipe except for adding cilantro and I used canned tomatoes with chili's added to them. I also used low carb/whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit healthier along with low fat cheese.  I will be making this recipe again!  Even my teenage son loved it!!

We absolutely loved this!  After reading the reviews I was hesitant to try the warm guacamole, but I am so glad I didn't leave it out.  I did use 1 more avocado than it called for, and still thought it could have used more.  Great with a little extra hot sauce and a dollop of sour cream!

This recipe was delicious and so easy to put together.  A couple suggestions: add a can of corn and hot sauce/chili powder to add a little more kick to the black bean mixture.  Also, I didn't layer the guac, I used it as a topping after cooking the rest (hot guac doesn't seem appetizing to me).

Delicious and so easy.  A refreshingly very filling vegetarian dish.  Now I have no reason to feel guilty about not having meat in a main dish.

We really enjoyed this recipe, using whatever we had in the house for the bean mix. We also used the cottage cheese and egg mix in the place of the avacadoes that one reviewer suggested. I would add more spice next time and take out some cheese to try to make it even healthier.

This is pretty good.  Very easy.  Forgot the cheese on the first layer--oops, and had to sub tortilla chips for tortillas as well as store bought guacamole for the avacados. We both liked it, and the chips were just fine.  Halved the recipe, and have leftovers--just the two of us.  Will be a nice dinner.  Thanks!

I make something similar for a quick and easy dinner.  It is so simple to substitute things based on what you have- I typically don't use garlic in this, but I like to add things like cumin or cilantro if I have it on hand. It's great with a layered black bean salad or bean dip on the side, and also good topped with sour cream.

Delicious. Used habanero lime flour tortillas from Trader Joes. Scrumptious. Was concerned about baking the guacamole, that it would turn brown, but it stayed emerald green..Making it again this weekend.

I used 2 cups of cottage cheese instead of the avocados and also added sliced black olives as one of the layers. This was delicious!! I would like to say that salt is not needed as part of the sautéing process if you use your own home cooked black beans as I did. I think the salt and pepper may only be needed if you use the canned beans. I'm making this again! It was fun to make, it's healthy, high protein and it tastes amazing!

I would give this a 4.5 if I could. Great and healthy recipe! I didn't use that many tortillas though. I had 12 inch tortillas and used 2-3 on the bottom and 2-3 for the middle layer. I added cayenne and sriracha to kick it up a bit. Serve with a little sour cream or plain yogurt.

I chose this recipe because I had some leftover guacamole (less than the recommended portion in recipe), salsa and cans of black beans. I added 1/4 jalapeno into the onion saute, fresh tomato and some cilantro. IT WAS SPICY! So, I downed the spice with dallops of sour cream. I made it in 3 layers in a standard loaf pan (9.25" x5.25"x2.75", used shredded mild cheddar and monterey jack cheese generously (a little more than the recipe indicates) Also, I used green bell pepper instead of red. Added probably a teaspoon+ Chili powder. Came out AWESOME! LOVE IT!

I took some liberties but am rating this recipe anyway because it was the same basic ingredients.  I had some leftover black bean salad (black beans, peppers, tomatoes, etc.) that I layered with avocados (instead of guac) and cheese.  I had to use flour tortillas because I didn't have corn.  And I topped it with sour cream before serving.  Absolutely delicious!  This is a keeper!!

This was very good.  My husband and three kids (6,4, and 1) all liked it.  It is not too spicy for young children.  They ate almost everything on their plates.  We used corn chips to scoop up and eat it and had sour cream on the side.  I did not use the peppers since I didn't have them, and I substituted corn chips for the tortillas.  I will make this again, but might try adding black olives (since I love them) to the mixture.

This is excellent! I did make some changes due to personal preference. I added corn and black olives instead of the bell peppers and I probably added more cheese cause I didn't measure it. It's very tasty and even better the next day. I just got done eating it heated up with taco sauce on top and sour cream. Mmmmm, mmmm!

I loved this recipe. I left out the guacamole and just had some on the side when the dish was finished. I also used about twice as much cheese as the recipe called for, including some Monterey Jack; and used tomatoes with chiles added in. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! I will definitely be making this again.

My husband really liked this dish, but I got wigged out by warm guacamole (i love guacamole, but feel it has a weird flavor warmed). I could only do 2 layers with all of the guacamole in the middle. It needed a lot more heat for me (even though i used hot pace picante and added 1/2 tsp chili powder) - Next time - and i know there will be a next time since hubby loved it- I will add green chilies or more chili powder :)

This is a GREAT Mexican Lasagna!  I've made it several times and it turns out great.  I don't mind the non-meat version,  but others in my house prefer additional protein, so one time I cooked a couple chicken breasts, shredded the meat, and added it to the mixture.  Excellent!  This time, I subbed a pound of ground chorizo sausage for one of the cans of beans.  Again, Excellent!  We do like things on the spicy side, so I've also added a Tbls of Cumin and Chili Powder.  Otherwise, I prepare as indicated.  We love it!  YUM!

The avocado and the tortillas were good.
The recipe does need spice and would maybe forgo salsa and just add more tomatoes next time. This dish does not reheat well. It was okay but nothing amazing.

Putting the guac in the oven to bake is a horrendous idea!! (I'm sorry, I had to use 2 exclamation points.)  I'm giving 2 stars because I got the idea for MY recipe from this recipe.

I did everything the same, except where the guac would have failed, I put a mixture of 2 cups cooked quinoa (which started with sautéed garlic, onions, cumin, celery salt, pepper and diced red pepper) 1/2 c. chopped walnuts and 1/2 c.  Beyond Meat Crumbles to add lots more protein.  Then added to that cooked and simmered quinoa mixture, 1/2 cup chipotle sauce and 1/2 cup tomato sauce and 1 tsp. cornstarch cooked in to add thickness to the layer. Then added my vegan cheese to the top and baked for 15 minutes at 400. I continued to layer as this recipe instructed and AFTER the pan came out the oven I let it  cool for 10 minutes.

So my middle layer was super tasty.  I cut it in squares and dolloped on guac and cashew sour cream and homemade salsa.  Super vegan, super tasty.

Very healthy but does not taste well. I was very disappointed. I though since it had almost 5 stars, it would be good. I don't think guacamole should be heated. It turns acidic and ruins the whole meal. I thought these ingredients would work but you really need to substitute the guacamole with refried beans.

This recipe was really good, even though I didn't have any avocados. Next time, I will be sure to add the avocados, and maybe some corn, and a dollop of sour cream.  It cooked faster than I expected so the cheese on top was a little overdone - next time I will set the timer for 25 minutes to check on it!

This was tasty!  The avocados my husband bought weren't ripe, so we ended up not including that part of the recipe.  Next time I think I will just buy pre-made guac, and cut down on some prep time.  Just a note:  when you are layering the veg/bean mixture, I used a slotted spoon.  DON'T.  Include all the juices from the skillet.  Mine came out pretty dry (but still surprisingly edible!).  I also added some tomato sauce, which probably helped compensate for the dryness, somewhat.  We will make it again!

This is good, especially for my vegetarian family. 
One change I did was:
Mix mashed/seasoned avocado to 1C of cottage cheese.
Use this mixture as the middle level of the lasagna and cover 
with cheese.

This is very similar to one of my father's specialty dishes - his was made with shredded chicken.  I loosely followed this recipe, having to make do with the ingredients that I had at home, and used some of my fathers techniques...I sauteed garlic and onions in a bit of oil, then added tomato sauce, a chopped up roasted red bell pepper, hot sauce, spices like tumeric, pepper and cumin, a sprinkling of sugar and a dash of apple cider vinegar.  I remember really enjoying tasting the tangy sauce when biting into my fathers version...When making this, I created a sort of assembly line set up.  I kept the tomato sauce simmering on low heat in a pot, and then in a frying pan, I'd heat two tortillas for a few minutes, then transer them to the tomato sauce for a few minutes, put new tortillas in the frying pan to heat up while removing the ones in the tomato sauce and layering them in my casserole dish...I layered thin strips of Meunster and creamy havarti cheese, then a layer of black beans, sliced black olives, a layer of labne (similar to sour cream) a layer of deli made salsa, then another layer of tortillas.  I didn't have fresh bell peppers on hand and I didn't add the guacamole to be baked...The result was absolutely delicious comfort food that didn't make me feel heavy afterwards.  Most any kind of cheese will do (I didn't layer mine on too thick), the sour cream bakes well, and some kind of peppers are necessary.  Avo on the side.

This is one of the best recipes I've come across. Even the big meat-eaters in my family love it and this is frequently requested to be brought to family gatherings. The only alteration I make is increasing the amount of guac in the recipe, but that's because we can't get enough of homemade guac and not anything wrong with the recipe!

I probably won't use this recipe again. It turned out okay but just.  As one reviewer said, the tortillas turn to mush in this dish and the avocados are lost in the mix. Seemed a little labor-intensive for a mediocre final product.

This was pretty good. I completely left out the avocado because I don't know many people who are fond of hot avocado. I also left out the lemon juice because I forgot about it. 
I substituted a can of chipolte tomatoes and added half of a small chopped jalapeno. I think next time I'll leave out the corn tortillas and use tortilla chips afterwards to dip into the 'lasagna'. I would definitely make this again.

Turned out alright. I used a can of rotel and 3 Roma tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes and salsa. I also added a can of corn for added flavor and veggies. Next time, I'm going to fry the tortillas a little in hopes that the final product isn't soggy. Tip: serge

Made it for lunch.  Too much onion.  The flavor was overpowered by onion and corn tortilla. I didn't like it.  Husband liked it.  Won't make it again.

The interesting thing about it was that it used corn tortillas in place of noodles. The black beans offer tons of protein. The avocado offers healthy monounsaturated fat. It also had onion, tomatoes, garlic, and peppers. It was really filling and packed with nutrition.

To add to my above review.  If cutting in 1/2 for the 2 of us, I think you could probably add the whole can of tomatoes.

Yum! we added sun dried tomatoes and basil to amp up the flavor, plus made extra guacamole like the other reviews suggested and it came out awesome! Whole wheat tortillas made it extra healthy - this is a great way to use tortillas in a new and different way.

Excellent! Easy to make, I agree with doubling the guacamole and also with adding the tomatoes with chilli, just to heat things up a bit. Also, neither of us are cheese eaters so I just left it out and it was fine without. We loved it. It will be a regular for us.

This is an very good dish. My husband, who is not a fan of "wet bread" loved it and asked me if I could make it again, and again!  I was really surprised that the tortillas took on the texture of pasta.  Of course, I made sure that they didn't get too soggy by cooking off most of the liquid from the mixture of black beans, tomatoes, etc.  Also, someone who is short on time can skip the entire second step and substitute a can of chunky tomato-bean-corn salsa and a can of black bean salsa for a very similar taste and texture (though I do love the cooked onions and peppers!).  I also added cumin and used an extra clove of garlic.

This is a really good recipe.  I wish I could give it 4 1/2 instead of 4 stars.  I did make some changes/additions to it though.  I added some chicken breasts that I had precooked and chopped into small pieces to the tomato bean mixture and used only one onion.  The onion I had was white and I thought the flavor may be too strong with two of them.  Next time I think I will add jalapenos as well for just a little more kick.

This was really good, but even though I added three avocados, there wasn't enough guacomole for more than one layer, and there was too much bean mixture to fit in the pan. The entire layering scheme was also off. In terms of taste though, I would make it again.

I thought this recipe was great! and it lasted all week for lunches.  I substituted half of the black beans with chicken (since I'm not vegetarian) that was cooked with taco seasoning, but either way, it is a yummy recipe, I got multiple complements on it!

I'm giving this four stars because the directions are wrong - the layering is off completely.  You can't get as many as the recipe says.  That being said - it was DELICIOUS.  I made it as a vegetarian option on Christmas Eve for my vegetarian friends and everyone loved it.  Really really tasty recipe and I'll be adding it to my regular meal rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this!  I generally use ready-made guacamole rather than making my own.  It just saves a little time.
