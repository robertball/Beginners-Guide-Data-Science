I am afraid I must say it was quite disappointing. The flavour is bland and it is dry and too gooey at the same time.

This just wasn't good.  The beans turned out very dry and it was pretty flavorless really.  I'd rather eat toast!  We only ate but a small helping of it.

I also found the beans dry.  I don't think I cut the bread small enough either.  Never quite got crispy as I expected on the edges, was cooked through but "gummy" on the inside.  The flavor was good, I will try it again with smaller bread.  I used Pam to grease the pan, next time I might use butter to see if it will crisp up around the edges.  Though it wasn't my favorite, it was a nice change from potatoes and rice.
