The filling for this is more like I would expect in a eggroll.  Over all they were good.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made over 50 dumplings.  You can freeze the filled dumplings (do not be tempted to over fill)  prior to cooking.  Make sure the edges are well sealed....there is nothing worse than having an over stuffed, ill sealed dumpling explode.

Bravo!  I love dandelion greens but never thought to us them in gyoza.  I was taught by my many Japanese  "mothers" but have tweaked it over the years.  I do use Napa cabbage and if you want an amazing dumpling, add Bacon Spam!
