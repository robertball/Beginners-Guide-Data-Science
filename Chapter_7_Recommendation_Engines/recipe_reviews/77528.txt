My husband and I love Oysters Rockerfeller, so I was so excited to find this recipe. Very simple to prepare, I did make a couple of modifications after reading the other reviews. I added hot sauce to the spinach mixture and also 2 heaping teaspoons of horseradish. I also combined parmesan cheese and grated romano cheese and sprinkled on top, along with more hot sauce. We love Tabasco sauce on our oysters. The horsradish was a must! Thanks for sharing!

This was a very easy recipe. However I feel if I had added onion with the garlic it would have given it more of a punch.  I felt something was missing I think it was the onions.  Also I use fresh spinach and sautee the spinach a little longer it was very good.  Will do it again only with onions the next time...Dohna

I thought this was very good, and gave it five stars because its great taste was produced with such ease of preparation.  I use a potato ricer for squeezing my spinach.  This would make six servings (as the recipe states) for use as an appetizer, but if using it for a main dish, plan on it serving two or maybe three people.

This is a great base recipe.  But, with some modifications it's now a family favorite.  I added a whole minced shallot, hot sauce and a tablespoon of horseradish sauce to the spinach (a bag of fresh spinach wilted it down).  Additionally, I mixed asiago cheese, 4 slices of bacon, diced, and old bay into the parmesan cheese.  Once I did this the dish was outstanding

Great with farfalle pasta. Needs a little more hot sauce than a dash.

Folks this is an easy excellent oyster rockefeller recipe.
I added crumbled bacon on top of oyster before adding cheese.
I would give more than 5 stars if allowed!

The modifications I made was to eliminate the hot sauce and add a dash of ouzo.  If you don't have ouzo, anise  would work.
