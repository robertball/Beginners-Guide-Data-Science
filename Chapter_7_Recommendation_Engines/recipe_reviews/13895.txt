I make this recipe alot but it is much better with some chopped bacon and some garlic.  I also eliminate the oil - it is still great without it and you dont have so much fat.

This recipe is similar to one that my Nan used to make.  Now that we have "rediscovered" the recipe, it has been passed around the family, and everyone loves it.  The only difference to our original recipe - we think! - is that we add bacon to ours, for a little added flavour.

As written I can see where this recipe might be a little bland, but a little salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and 8 slices of cooked & crumbled bacon made it very good.  It tastes much like a quiche' but not as "eggy".  This is a good basic recipe to use up all that summer zucchini and experiment with additional ingedients. I'll make it again adding different seasoning & ingredients. Fun to experiment.

I have made this a few times and i think its great for a side dish at a BBQ. I usually add a few extra things like garlic and greated carrot. I also add some extrea chhese on the top and it makes a nice little crust. this recipe is a keeper, great in summer.

My Stepmother Janet, who lived in Oz for many years gave me this recipe, and like others she adds the chopped bacon, it IS more tasty! However my daughter is now vegetarian and I have been adding chopped button mushrooms (her favorite veg) and it is delish!

I tried this recipe on Sunday night for my husband who never eats Zucchinis...except I added 4 chopped bacon rashes, 2 teaspoons of garlic salt, freshly ground pepper and since I didn't have any swiss cheese I just used a cup of grated tasty cheese....it was just scrumptious...so delish...it will be a family favourite now...he couldn't get enough of it. I used an 8 inch pie dish to cook mine in and baked it in an 180 degrees C fan forced oven for 45 mins. He has even taken the left overs to work for lunch today....that is high praise indeed. Thanks so much...This is now a permanent in our family....yum yum..PS Forgot to add that I diced  the onion finely rather than grated it...

In Australia we eat zucchini slice often, and mum always added some cooked bacon. I also use slightly less oil and salt and pepper are a must to add flavour. I usually also add in some corn and sometimes a grated carrot, depending what I am trying to use up, and I use cheddar cheese as it is cheaper. This is a good, basic recipe that can be adapted to suit different tastes.

Very good recipe to start with.  Only problem was the size pan - loaf - it took a while for the middle to cook and ended up in the over for a bit over an hour (and was still a little mushy).  I would probably use a slice pan next time.  I added one sweet potato grated in place of one zucchini and 2 cloves a of garlic as well as salt and pepper.  Was a hit with adults and children.  Thank you!

This was a great starter recipe for me, I really liked the premise of it, but made some significant changes, well additions really.  I added bacon as others suggested, caramelized onions and garlic, salt & pepper, red pepper flakes.  Also, for cheese I used a few different kinds, essentially using up a bunch of 'ends' I had in the fridge.  It was a great way to use up extra zucchini and other leftovers in the fridge.

It was a good start - I didn't want to make any modifications because I wanted to see what the original recipe would taste like.  It was bland and bitter (I forgot to peel the zucchini - I wonder if this made it bitter?)  Next time I will try it with bacon, garlic, salt and pepper to see if the flavor improves.

A nice alternative to the typical zucchini recipes.  As suggested by another reviewer, I added bacon and garlic.  I would also add salt and some crushed tomato.

This is an old recipe my family uses, so it was great to find it here. First, I would be careful with the zucchini - I had one enormous one that was plenty! I also added cracked pepper, a little cumin and nutmeg. Interesting combination, but it added a little something! Great for barbeques, lunches, etc

This was very good.  I added 4 slices of bacon, 4 cloves of garlic, and 1 cup of mexican blend cheese. Turned out very light and fluffy.  Great use for zucchini!

This is the purfect poor mans meal. My mom use to make this for me and my sister. It was the only way to get us to eat zucchini. it could use some season all or garlic  powder. Also, I used 1/2 cup flower. I think the flower is what makes it bland.

Ugh, can I give this a zero or a negative 5? This was absolutely disgusting, worst dish I have ever made, ever! I can't even give comments to improve upon it. The taste was terrible, I could not even finish was serving. Extremely acidic, bitter and gross.

I had to cook this longer than stated,  and found it to be really bland. I think I would add bacon, spinach, garlic at least. My kids liked it ok,  but my husband was less than impressed.  I like it as a base recipe,  and will make it again,  with some improvisations.

I remembered the first time I've ever had zucchini slice it was amazing and when I found this recipe I couldn't wait to try it out. I made a few changes: 1). I didn't use the recommended size tray, I used my normal tray that I roast veges in and increased the cooking time to 50mins. 2). I replaced the onion for 1 grated carrot because it added more color to the dish. 3). Instead of swiss I used one cup of colby cheese because swiss is too mild. 4) I added one cup of bacon and also added salt and pepper. 5) I added only 1/4 cup of canola oil. Next time I am going to add 1/4 tsp of onion powder to give it an extra bit of savory flavor.

Admittedly, I didn't have swiss cheese on hand which I'm sure would've improved it (I used cheddar). But it was fairly bland, which was fine for my twelve month old! It has to be cooked for much longer than stated - about an hour fifteen.

Tried this for the wife & myself tonight, read the reviews about bland, added half a pkg of Szechwan seasonings.  My biggest problem is: how much is 3 Zucchinis? Please measure in cups, I used 3/8ths of a huge peeled and gutted zucchini...Filled a 9x9 pan...Tasted ok, but lots of leftovers...

So, I just made this and added what I thought would be flavor after reading everyone's reviews. I sautéed the onion in garlic, added salt, pepper, white pepper, french fried onions on top, and a pinch of cayenne. I even omitted 1/2 cup of flour! Still has no flavor. All that = no flavor. Add REDHOT = YUMMY!

We love this! We add either bacon or ham and use cheddar cheese. Some times I add carrots and broccoli if I have some extra. I always make enough to make  2-9x13 pans so there is some leftover for lunch the next day. I also use gluten free flour and I add a little baking powder to it.

Great as a side dish or if you eat lots of salad with it, works great with sour cream as well. On its own the taste is a little bland.
