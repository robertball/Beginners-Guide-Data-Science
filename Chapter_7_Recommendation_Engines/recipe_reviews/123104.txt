Great recipe! I think some people may be misreading the ingredients, and not realizing that it calls for -baked- potatoes. So...ummmm....already cooked, folks. IMO, a microwaved baked potato doesn't hold a candle to one done in the oven. I guess it depends on if you're going for "easy snack" or "impressive appetizer." I also used unsalted butter in place of the vegetable oil, but I think that's a flavor preference. Before wrapping with foil and baking the potatoes, I rubbed them with butter and lightly coated them with garlic sea salt. Make sure the oven is hot enough! Otherwise you just get over-cooked potatoes and not the crispier skins. Great for a football play-off day! Thanks!

A great way to use the scooped potatos is to put in a bowl, mash with a fork with a little butter or margarine.  (of course you can add garlic or whatever season flavor you like) Spread out cresent rolls to form a rectangle push together and cut in half.  Put some potato in the middle, fold all four edges up - forming those cute little potato puffs that you get at the supermarket for so much money!!  bake at 350 until golden brown.  I also do this with leftover mashed potato's.  Here get two appetizers in one!

Delicious!  I baked these for a BBQ, and they were a big hit!  

I followed the directions as written except I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used bacon bits instead of making my own bacon, and they turned out great.  If you don't want to spend the time to bake the potatoes, try throwing them in the microwave for about 8-10 minutes on high, and then you can cut them in halves and scoop out the insides.  

I put the oil/spices mixture on the outsides of the skins and baked them upside-down first.  Then after baking for 7 minutes, I pulled them out, coated the insides of the skins, and then baked them for the next 7 minutes.  I didn't find them that greasy as others did- just don't put too much of the oil/spices mixture on the skins.  Before I put the cheese and bacon bits on the insides of the skins, I took a paper towel and soaked up the little puddles of oil to make them even less greasy.

Very good.  I baked the potatoes the night before, let them cool and refridgerated them over night.  Then I did the next steps in the morning right before I served them.

This was a GREAT recipe to use as a guideline! Thanks! I didn't make skins, I made baked potato wedges! I just cut them in half like they said, and I then quartered them, and left all the potato. I used melted butter instead, and brushed it on the potato, and put them in the oven skin-side down, and baked as recommended for 7 - 9 minutes. Then I added the shredded cheese, and baked until perfect. We then added the cooked bacon, and topped with sour cream and chives, they were FABULOUS! Thanks again!

Simply Wonderful!  Very flavorful. We had a small neighbors get together and people raved about how good these potatoes were. Shhhh don't tell anyone, but I used older potatoes that were soft. I wasn't sure if they were going to be any good; they were really fantastic. As others suggested I used the olive oil and using bacon bits really was a time saver.  I coated the potato with the oil mixture then baked the potatoes for 1 hr at 425 degrees then let the taters sit for about 15 to 20 minutes before scooping out the insides. I followed by coating one side baking 7 min. then the other side and bakinb 7 min.

These were good. I made the mistake of not leaving enough potato in the skins and they were a little burnt when I took them out. Otherwise, they were very good (and would have been better if I had left 1/4 inch of potato like it said :) I made mashed potatoes with the "pulp" by blending it with sour cream and chives, and garlic salt.

I made these tonight as a trial run for our party for New Years Eve.  I also used smaller potatoes which I put in the microwave to get a little soft as to take the pulp out a little easier. I also cut back a little on the oil and used EVOO. I used a pastry brush on the inside and outside.  These turned out great.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This recipe was very yummy! I used spray butter, instead of oil (to lighten it up a bit), and the recipe turned out great! I will make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I followed it exactly except that I left out the bacon.  I took these to a potluck and they were gobbled up.  My only complaint is the amount of oil...they were a bit greasy for having been baked.  I will definitely make this again!

Didn't change a thing and wouldn't change a thing - except we all agreed they could have used a little more salt.  As good or better than any I've ever had anywhere. So crisp!  (I've had some that were a little on the limp and soggy side) We also all agreed these were so good we could easily skip dinner and just eat potato skins.   I was an absolute rock star with this!

Great recipe! The spices and the parm cheese really set these apart from regular potato skins.  I doubled the amount for poker night and they were gone before the first beer was.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

These were delicious. I made 34 skins for our NYE party tonight and only 2 were left by the end of the night. Per another reviewer, I coated the insides of the skins with the oil/cheese mixture and baked for 7 minutes, then turned the skins over, coated the backs, and baked for 7 minutes more. I needed 2 recipes worth of the oil/cheese mixture (one to coat the fronts, and one for the backs), but I didn't need to increase it nearly as much as I expected for the amount that I was doing. We also sprinkled diced tomatoes on top as they came out of the oven.

These were excellent.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and baked on 400.  The potatoes must be baked before you start to make the recipe.  I also left a little more potato in than the recipe called for.  They turned out perfect. Thanks!

I love this recipe! The potato skins are always a hit when I make them. My only suggestions is to put the potatoes a 13x9 cake pan or something similar. The first time I made the potatoes they were on a cookie sheet and I ended up oil all in the bottom of my oven. It was a huge smokey mess perfect for when my guests showed up. The next time I used the cake pan and it worked great!

these are one of our favorite sides.  i always wash my spuds well and rub them with oil, salt and pepper then bake at 425 for 55 min.  it makes for a tasty crisy skin. i let the potatoes cool for about 30 min dont let them get to cooled the inside doesnt scoop out as well.  i scrape them out so much that there is hardly any potato left.  we like them best that way.  i do use butter instead of oil for the inside rub.  its a must to have real bacon bits, sour cream, and guacamole.  oh so yummy and worth the extra work.   our dog loves the leftover potato that we scrape out.  he likes the recipe too.

Delicious.  I have some helpful hints:  I put the sour cream in a bowl in the center of the potato skins so people could add it based on their own preference.  Also, I baked about 8 smaller russet potatoes instead of the 4 large and increased the other ingredients accordingly- I think people prefer a smaller potato skin to eat and plus you make more this way. I baked the potatoes in the morning and then finished everything else when I was close to being ready to serve them.  And I flipped the skins over after the first 7 minutes- wasn't sure that was what was intended when the recipe was written but it did ensure that the skins got nice and crispy.  I omitted the paprika= not a fan.  I know you will enjoy this recipe!

I made these tonight and they tasted awesome!! I used bacon fat instead of vegetable oil---more tasty.  If you're adding cheese, sour cream and bacon....might as well go all the way and use bacon fat.  I'll diet tomorrow! lol

So good and so easy!  I microwaved the potatoes and used smaller potatoes and they worked great.  The seasoning mix is so tasty that I am going to use it on my roasted potatoes.  Yummy!

Made these exactly to recipe and they were wonderful. I actually prepared them 24 hours in advance, set them on a cookie sheet in the fridge overnight and popped them into the oven during the party. Perfect make-ahead appetizers!

Yum!  I had a huge bag of small potatoes and froze a lot of it with bacon (some with cubed ham) and cheese already toped.  Froze well, but have to admit they only lasted 3 weeks in the freezer.  Was a great last minute treat for meetings and company.

These are great, and SO easy! I made them eaven easier - instead of brushing with oil, I sprayed with non-stick spray and sprinkled with a specialty garlic/salt mixture I had on hand. Topped as stated - just perfect! And so nice that you don't have to fry them.

These are 10x better than Fridays potato skins! What's important is to bake the potato first. It seems some people are skipping that step. The best way to bake a potato is to scrub it clean and poke some holes in it on both sides with the tines of a fork. Then rub a bit of olive oil and season with sea salt. Put it straight on the middle rack without aluminum foil. Aluminum foil steams the potato and doesn't allow the skin to get delicously toasted. For a medium sized baking potato, 25 minutes on one side and then turn for 20 minutes on the other side at 400 degrees. The recipe is perfect as is, but I went a little extra with the seasonings and it was absolutely delicious!! Very hearty and filling! A+ recipe

These were delicious... just remember to get BIG baking potatoes because if they are too small the skins don't have enough room for all the good stuff :)

Made twice, the first time I baked the skin side up first. The second time I baked potato side up first. The second time came out much better if you like you want the potato crispy like I do. Also mixed cheese with some pepper jack I had left over and it was so delicious. The parm cheese on coating makes the this so good. I just microwaved the potatoes about an hour before serving so they can cool off which makes it easier to shell out centers. Recommend serving straight from oven to get the best "ooohhh it's good" comments.

This is my most requested snack.  People love them.  I've made it with baked potatos and microwaved, and they do turn out better when they're baked.  But if you have friends pop in on you, they are still awesome when nuked.  Keeper!

These came out really great, but I may have used the wrong kind of potato (Idaho) because my skins were falling apart when I tried to scoop the potato out. The taste was awesome though!

My husbands favorite snack. They're incredibly easy to make and taste great. :) 

If you have a melon ball or something similar, use that to scoop out the inside of the potatoes so it doesn't tear the skin.

Perfect as is!  Time consuming, though!  Next time, I will bake the potatoes a day in advance (I used howtobakeapotato.com's instructions), refrigerate overnight, then do this recipe's instructions before serving.  These were delicious!!  Doubled the recipe!!

These were a smash at Super Bowl time last year! I'm bringing them back for New Year's Eve! I cut myself a little slack and used pre-packaged real bacon bits. I made sure they were REAL bacon though! I also was able to cut each skin into about 6 or 8 slices, though that might have been the size of the potatoes. I'll make them exactly the same as I did last year!

This recipe calls for too much oil. It had a great flavor but I had to use a napkin to remove the excess oil. 

Next time I will use 2 tbl of olive oil.

Wow!  These were superb and a huge hit at our Memorial Day cookout.  I doubled the recipe and used very large baking potatoes that I "baked" in the microwave (3 at a time for 15 mins).  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a "t" and these were restaurant quality or better!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe Trish!

These were really amazing! Love it! Pretty simple. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used turkey bacon and low fat sour cream to make it a little healthier. Totally recommended!

Wonderful! Made it two days in a row.  1st with golden Yukon potatoes (only ones on hand). Then the 2nd day with Russet potatoes. Liked both equally. My husband says we don't have to go to Friday's anymore. I was one that didn't see the 4 "baked" potatoes.  Just cut them lengthwise covered them with water and popped them in the microwave for 5- 7 minutes. Oh yeah and the scooped potatoes makes my favorite dish mashed potatoes. Made it quickly by just adding extra butter and ranch dressing.

I used a lot more cheese only because we're cheesy kind of people. Here's a hint: when scooping out the guts of the potato, use a melon baller ~ its much easier to use and you have more control of it and won't rip the skin of the potato. Otherwise ~ FABULOUS!

This was definitely my go to recipe this holiday season!  Most of the get togethers that we went to were finger foods only, and even with using 5 lbs of potatoes, this was the first platter to empty at every party.  I haven't had a recipe that I didn't change at all in a long time, but we loved this one exactly as is!  Thanks for sharing. :)

These were very good. I didn't have a problem with them too greasy, although I slightly reduced the amount of oil. Additionally, I substitued vegetable oil for olive oil to help reduce unhealthy fats. The mistake I made is, I left too much potato on the skin, because I was afraid to scoop them too thin for fear of them being too burnt or crispy. So instead they were cooked perfectly but was too thick with potato. So I think I'm better off listening to the recipe, and scooping more potato off for better flavor. They were still really delicious! Enjoy!

Great!! I had a girl's Christmas party and since I didn't want to overwhelm them with huge potatoes I used small Yukon Gold. (about 2" long). I baked them the night before and the next day scooped insides out with melon baller. Just before leaving I coated them both sides with oil mixture and placed them skin side up on a baking pan. At party popped them in oven 7 min, turned them over and 7 min more, filled with cheese and bacon and in 2 min the were perfect. Everyone loved them. Thanks for great idea.

I made this recipe for the Superbowl and they were great!  It was the perfect game day nosh.   Everyone in the family loved these.   I will definitely make these again.  I accidentally substituted cayenne for the paprika.  Since the amount was small, it just added a subtle burn, just enough to be pleasant.  Next time, I may add both the paprika and cayenne.

These were crispy and delicious. I left off the bacon and they were still great! I made breakfast with the leftovers. I reheated the potato skins in the oven and scrambled some eggs with onion. I topped the potatoes with the eggs and some extra cheese- YUM!

I came on here to edit my original review after many years of making these. I have kept the recipe the same, other than doubling the cheese and spices. Now, instead of dunking the skins in the oil and spice mixture, I brush oil on both sides, then dunk the entire skin in a Tupperware with the cheese and spices in it and shake it around. This lets me get the cheese and spice coverage without the extra oil. If I need more spices, I can sprinkle it on before putting them in the oven. This recipe is always a winner! 

Original review: 
WOW! Made these for a multi-family camping trip for about 40 people and I am now REQUIRED to make these on every camping trip! They came out FANTASTIC! I actually DUNKED the potatoes in the oil and spice mixture to evenly coat all the sides...AMAZING!

These were good. We used left over carne-asada instead of bacon. The parmesan-oil mix really gave the potatoes good flavor. We'll definitely make it again.

Please remember to bake the potatoes before you start digging at them....It does say to but I didnt catch the baked part of the potatoe so it took me about an hour. I will never make that mistake again cause they were so amazing I will be making these for myself when hungry they were so good....Total hit at my house.

Good recipe.  The parmesean is probably not necessary.  Tricks: Bake the potatoes in the oven at 400F for 1 hour.  Scoop out the pulp and double the amount of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and oil.

Always a favorite!!  No matter how many I make, they get eaten.  The less potato you remove, the more filling they are.  I always cut up the bacon before cooking and then cook it in a sauce pan, which is way more fun and I never burn my fingers crumbling it!

Came out great! They're not very healthy, but great to make for company- everyone loves them! I added finely chopped garlic, chives and a little more Parmesan cheese than the recipe called for. Made with bacon bits because it's all I had in the house, but it still came out good. I'm sure it would have been even better with real bacon.

These were great-I love potato skins but hate all the grease-these had all the flavor without leaving an oil sheen behind. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne into the mix to add a little heat-other than that followed the recipe exactly.

These were fantastic. I only added a little extra love such as fresh parmesean to the butter mix. Added a dash of smoked papirika to a few that gave them little extra zing.

These were pretty good, I like how they get a little crispy. Leave a little potato in there though. I also liked the seasoning!

Some reviewers said that it was too oily however, mine was not.  Unfortunately I was not able to make it with real bacon because I did not have any so I asked my guests if they were okay with artificial bacon bits and they were. Everybody said it was perfect and asked for the recipe.  Maybe it was not oily because there was no extra oil from the bacon bits.  Excellent recipe.

Fantastic recipe.  Made these for my husband and a couple friends, they all loved them.  I used the potato inside for mashed potatoes the next night for dinner.  I also added some extra bacon, but I am a bacon lover and figured you can never have enough!

Good recipe I also made these for a New Years party and they came out great.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also used a mixture of pepper jack and cheddar to spice them up a bit.  I will absolutely make these again.  I totally agree baking the potatoes in the oven is the way to go.

I microwaved the potatoes instead of baking them (i.e. to make baked potatoes for use in the recipe) and it worked fine.  Maybe not quite as crisp as possible, but everyone loved them.

I used some of the bacon grease instead of vegetable oil for flavor but used less than what it called for.  I brushed the insides first & baked them then turned them upside down & brushed the other side & baked again so the grease could run out & they wouldn't be greasy.  That worked really well.  I don't know if I skipped a step or if it isn't included but I felt the potato skins could have used a dash of salt before adding the toppings.  Or add more to the oil mixture to begin with.  Other than that they were terrific!

My husband loves potato skins, and I'm so glad i can now make them at home and save a fortune!  I was worried about the temp of the oven going in, but they turned out nice and crispy and i could have cooked them longer than 15 min total for a nice crisy skin.  I used margarine instead of butter.  I brushed the skin side first, let them cook, then brushed a mixture of the butter, salt, pepper, etc after i flipped them.  Served with homemade ranch from this site.  Awesome!

Really good!  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because mine came out a bit too crispy and almost burnt at 450 for 7 min on one side and 5 on the other.  Next time, I'll leave a bit more potato on the skin and bake them for 5 min and 5 min.

I keep a large batch of the spice mixture in a plastic shake jar in the fridge so it's always ready.  I use a pastry brush to lightly coat with evoo then shake on the spices. ( try smoked paprika!)  Instead of a baking sheet I use the top part of the broiler pan (sprayed) so air can circulate and aid in crisping. I serve with jalapeño ranch.  Depending on how hot you can stand it....1 lg jalapeño rough chopped and 1 cup ranch blended together in the mini chopper.

This is a fantastic and versatile recipe that is simple and tasty.  The toppings can vary based on personal taste.  I've yet to make this and receive anything other than rave reviews.

Let me add my 5 star review to this great recipe.  Watching the playoff game and needed some skins.. and this was it!!  I did use butter to lather the inside & outside of the scooped out potatoes.  I then just salted & peppered the inside and baked according to the directions.  Made perfect skins, crunchy, smooth, hot, yummy!  I think the sour cream and green onions make them.

I used 4 tbsp of oil because I very liberally brushed it on the skins after whisking with the spices. Absolutely delicious.

Love these! I used garlic olive oil last time and it worked great. Still end up throwing out the insides but will find something to make with them next time.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I added some grated Asiago cheese and some coarsely grated Parmesan cheese along with extra sharp Cheddar.  I baked my bacon in the oven until got it a little crisp then patted off the grease with paper toweling.  This is one of my appetizers for Christmas Eve tonight!

Unbelievably delicious!  This is a 10 star recipe and definite restaurant quality.  In fact, they're better than any restaurant potato skins we've had.  They easy and fast (just microwave potatoes) and you can tailor them to your liking...more cheese..less cheese...bacon, no bacon.  The seasoning is what makes them so delicious, so definitely do not skip or alter that step.  Another keeper!

Best EVER!  Oh my gracious - this is so awesome!  The mixture used on the skins with oil/Parmesan, etc is BRILLIANT!  I've never had my family react so strongly to a recipe.  My children request this daily, no kidding (although I don't make it daily, obviously lol).  We use turkey bacon and I let everyone put on sour cream if they want it or omit it if they don't.  This is the best.  Thank you ever so much!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed this exactly, except that I didn't add the bacon.  My potatoes were on the larger side, so I ran out of the seasoning.  I would double it next time, but otherwise this was great.

I loved these and I'm not a big fan of potatoes! But I wanted to try them and they definitely changed my liking for potatoes. I even got my boyfriend to eat them and he's a picky eater. On the second try I added the insides on top with the bacon and cheese. Just as delish!

These were absolutely delicious!  Since my potatoes were more medium sized, I only cooked them for 7 minutes, cut side down and then 2 minutes with the bacon and cheese added.  I also only used 2 T. of oil per other reviews.  They were gone in minutes!  I was pushed for time, so I microwaved the potatoes instead of baking in the oven, and I really hate to do that, but they still turned out really crispy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent, I tossed the baked potatoes with EVOO and kosher salt before baking. Then I only had to oil and season the one half (essentially halved the oil and seasonings).  Very tasty, took them to a going away party and e-mailed them your recipe.  Thanks!

These were GOOD. Very good. The only thing I would change next time is a little less salt in the mix....but I'm a person who doesn't really like salty food in general.

Tasty, crispy and delicious.

This recipe is pretty good on its own but I always boil them instead of baking them first. This helps get rid of extra dirt off the skins you can't wash off and helps make the insides more tender than just baking.

You need to use a high smoke point oil to bake them till crisp if you use butter it will burn and have a weird taste. The oil isn't for flavor it's to help them crisp you won't taste it. 

Other than that this is a great recipe on it's own no modifications needed but a short cut I liked to use it buying bacon bits (of real bacon) and using those instead-they crisp up lovely in the oven while bacon and taste just as fresh! I also leave off the green onions as we don't find the taste appealing on the skins.

Made these on St Patricks Day before I served the Corned beef.  Crispy, flavorful and delicious.  Potato skins are a little out of favor lately.  If we all start making these, they will make a comeback!

Very yummy. My family enjoyed these very much. The only thing I did different was I poured a tiny bit of olive oil in my hands and rubbed it on the potatoes. Because last time I made them I had a little puddle of oil in the centers and I personally don't like brushes. Then I sprinkled the spice mixture on them. They came out good, little dry. Very good recipe! Thanks!

Amazing! These are crispy and flavourful. The spices in the oil are perfect! They take some time to make, but are worth it! If I had less time to make these, I would pre-bake the potatoes and the bacon.

This was INCREDIBLE. I have NEVER had potato skins this good. I had to use mozarella instead of cheddar, but the flavor was so OFF THE CHARTS that the change of cheese didn't make one difference. I will make these 1,000 more times. Thank yoU!!!!!

So yummy! I made these for super-bowl Sunday and everyone said they were awesome! The thing that makes them awesome is the spices/oil you baste on the skins before you stuff them - so delish! I actually used a whole bag of potatoes (around 20) so I had to up the "servings" to 40!!! I followed what another poster did and basted outside of the skins first and baked them for 7 minutes and then basted the inside and baked them for 7 minutes, soaking up any "leftover" oil on the inside with a paper towel. Even though I made technically 40 servings (20 potatoes), I still only used a little over 4 cups of cheese - a mix of mozzarella and cheddar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe except I substituted Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the vegetable oil. They were so good. I will be making them again for sure!

Just finished eating our potato skins and I/we must say that these were wonderful....what a way to start the Super Bowl.  My kids loved them.  The seasoning was great, the crunch was great.  "THANKS!"

This is the potato skin recipe I have been looking for. Very good, and you can adjust the toppings to your liking. I used real bacon bits instead my own bacon.

You can cut the cheese in half and you'll be fine (as written these things are drowning in cheese), but this is otherwise a perfect recipe.  I made this as an appetizer for Christmas and they were gone in minutes.

Made these for Christmas Eve and all in my picky family loved them. I was pressed for time, so I cooked the potatoes in the microwave, may not be as good as baking, but they were still great.

Yummy! I love them! The first time I made them I forgot to bake them before taking out the pulp. However, they still turned out fine when I cooked them without baking the potatoes first. Great recipe, hard to mess up if you do it correctly.

A delicious way to indulge in potato skins without nearly as much guilt!  Turned out nice and crunchy with lots of flavor from the seasoned oil. These would be great for a gameday gathering!

I didn't think these were that spectacular.  If I ever made them again, I would scoop out more potato before dressing them up, and I would have used the oil mixture a little more sparingly and evenly.

More or less perfect!  The only thing I have to wonder is if the Parmesan used in the recipe was the  out of a can because real Parmesan made the skins stick to the cookie sheet.  I think I would just grate Parmesan and sprinkle it into the shell with the cheddar next time.

My review is for this recipe as written, with minor exceptions, and that is, I quartered the potatoes to make them friendlier for small fingers, and I used smoked paprika. Can't say much other than 'delicious as is'. Thank you.

Always a good appetizer. I get two appetizers out of one potato when I make these...I mash the insides of the potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar & butter then wrap it up in frozen crescent roll dough and bake till golden brown. Potato puffs!

My family said these are the ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!  I even added broccoli in them.  And for the extra potatos that were scooped out?  Used them to make Hot Dog a la Potato from this site.  OK - not the most healthy meals, but served them several days apart so I don't feel guilty - tee hee.

This was great. Thanks for the recipe. The first time I made them, we couldn't wait so I didn't turn and crisp the outside .... big mistake. Make sure you take the time to follow directions appropriately. YUM

Very delicious.  I made twice the recipe. I did not get a chance to freeze any leftovers, as my three teenage boys and husband ate them all.  I also substituted bacon with cubed seasoned cooked chicken on half of them.  I recommend large russet potatoes.  A year ago I tried a smaller potato of a different variety, and the skins were too thin and kept breaking when I scooped the potato out.   Next time, I will not put parmesan cheese on the skin side as it burns to quickly, only on the inside.  Great recipe.

These are very good!  I made them for our appetizer night and eveyone enjoyed them.  Next time instead of olive oil I may use butter.  I know its not the healthiest substitue but I didn't like how it pooled in the middle of the potato while baking.  It kinda made everything seem greasy.  I'm thinking butter may soak in a bit more.  We'll see!   :)

These beat anything served in a bar/restaurant.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble at all turning out a perfect result.  You get a crispier potato skin when you bake the plain potatoes in the oven vs the microwave (then finishing in the oven).  I didn't really measure the cheese or bacon, just threw a bunch in.  Hmm, wonder if this is why I'm fat?  ;)  Anyway, wonderful recipe, you won't go wrong here

I rated it four stars because I made changes and, with the changes, my friends and I felt they were to die for! I followed others' advice about coating the potato in the oil mixture before wrapping it in foil and baking it in the oven at 425 for about an hour. Since I wanted them to be more of an appetizer, I quartered the potato instead of halving it and only left about an 1/8" to a 1/4" of potato on the peel. I brushed both sides with the oil mixture again and followed baking directions. I shredded my own cheese and used a Cheddar and Monterey Jack blend instead of just Cheddar. My friend said they were the best she'd ever had and I agree!! Thanks for the recipe! OH and I forgot, I used about 2/3 butter to 1/3 oil in the oil mixture and ALSO pretty much doubled the oil/butter in the recipe to coat all of my potatoes on both sides (and I used 5 small-medium sized baking potatoes). Sorry if this was confusing :)

WOW!  These are GREAT!  I tend to look for a recipe that may be better than the one I just tried but I won't even look at another baked potato skin recipe.  I only regret that I can't give it more stars.

Best skins ever!  I do make a little extra sauce to "paint" on skins.  Make sure you bake long enough to crisp them.  (I always bake the potatos ahead of time....makes no difference.  Just bake and refreigerate..when ready... hollow and follow the next steps.)

I am trying to replicate a recipe from Oregon Electric Station in Eugene, OR (Go Ducks!), my home town.  These were just as good and without deep frying!  I didn't use the paprika, just because, but they were fabulous! These will now be a regular part of our meals.  Thanks for sharing!

The family said these were better than potato skins we have ordered at any restaurant -- and we've tried a lot of them!  The seasonings are particularly tasty.

These skins were sooooooo good! The vegetable oil mixture was great! I doubled it because my baked potatos were large and I wanted some extra seasonings.. and I also rubbed the vegetable oil mixture on the potato as it was baking inside the foil. I used Kraft cheese crumbles along with some sheredded cheese and it gave it a nice consistancy! GREAT!

Great Recipe!  I'm new to cooking but love potato skins so I made this for a neighborhood get together.  They were a hit. You could put whatever you prefer in them.  One change I suggest is to make more of the oil & spice to spread on the skins to be sure you have enough.

Very good. I made a few more than 4 potatoes. I quartered the skins and got 8 bite size pieces per potato for finger food while watching the Eagles play Arizona in the playoffs today. It didn’t help them. ?  I also had Crab Dip, pulled Pork, Sour Cream and Chives and Salsa on the side for toppings as desired.  I baked the potatoes earlier this morning and cooked them just a little on the hard side and used inside potato for home fries for breakfast.

Awesome!  But of course I did things a bit different.
1. I used 8 medium red potatoes
2. I used colby jack cheese instead of cheddar
3. I used choped pepperoni instead of bacon
4. No green onions & no sour cream
5. Added homemade avocado salsa

Mainly I referred to this recipe for how to cook the potato skins in order to create a delicious vessel for my chosen toppings, and I gotta tell you, the potatoes turned out way better than I had anticipated!  The mixture you brush over the skins is super good.  They were perfectly cooked at the end, with just the right amount of crispiness.  

I am definitely going to make this again!

Perfect potato skins that went over well at the Super Bowl party.  I used the pulp another night for mashed potatoes.

a brand new appreciation for making these. took a while because you have to use baked potatoes, but OMG the were so good. cut the sour cream bc I don't usually have it and bf doesn't like it and they were perfect. It was a full meal with 5 small potatoes, left overs will be tried in an omelet tom.

I love this dish, I made a couple of times and everyone loves them.The only thing I change is that I have to leave my potatoes for 10 minutes in my oven, but besides that no complains.

Wow. I've made baked potato skins before - the basic concept isn't hard. But this recipe really kicks it to the next level. The brush of oil with paprika etc gives it a wonderful flavor.

These were amazing!  Hit of our Super Bowl party!  I made them with turkey bacon, low fat sour cream, olive oil instead of veg oil.  Next time I will halve the oil ingredients...I had a lot left over.  I served them with seasoned sour cream (a restaurant in our area serves them this way and I was able to find a similar recipe).

I made these today, wouldn't change a thing, except I sprayed my skins with olive oil spray. Did not want the sour cream, but know it would taste good with it. I WILL be making these again for the grand-kids! They like store-bought skins so I know they will love these! Thanks!

This recipe was delicious. I made it very healthy using low-fat cheese and sour cream. I also substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon.

Simple and delicious "bar food."  Perfect for the big game!  I think russets work the best.

These were yummy! The only aspect missing from this recipe is what to do w/ the scooped out potato. In hindsight, I would make more of the oil/seasoning mix and add it to the scooped out bits of potato and bake it along side the skins. Additionally, I made minor modifications to this recipe: using canola oil in replace of the veg. oil and used plain yogurt in place of sour cream.

Made these for munching during the playoff games yesterday.....they were a big hit.....I made some with turkey bacon for my boyfriend that doesn't eat pork and those were great as well.  All but 2 were gone and I made 14!  You'll use every bit of cheddar cheese, so plan on having a little extra.  Using a melon baller as a previous reviewer suggested is a great tip.  Make sure not to take out too much of the potato.  The 1st couple I did, I made too thin and they didn't want to hold during baking as well.  Basting with the oil and baking on both sides is very important as it make the skins nice and crispy on top!  Great recipe!  Will definitely make again.

All I can say is OMG!!!  These things are decadent!  My husband went nuts over them.  They are a bit time consuming so if you are making them as appetizers for guests, you must think ahead.  The baked potatoes take an hour in the oven which I recommend rather than microwave because you will never get that crispy skin unless you bake them.  But you can cook the bacon while they are in the oven.  This recipe is simply awesome.  I'm making them again this coming Friday for my folks.  I can't wait!

Made as written except I used leftover ham instead of bacon.  We loved the flavor of the oil mixture, particularly the grated parm.  Great for NYE when we just wanted to snack on apps all night, and would also be good for a game day munchie.  Thanks for a really good recipe.

This is a delicious combination of flavors for the potato skins.  I combined everthing in a bowl and dipped my skins before laying them on the cookie sheet.  It took a little longer for mine to crisp up, but I just kept checking them until I was satisfied with the texture.  The remaining oil and parmesan mixture was great mixed in with the left-over potato pulp for twice baked potatoes the next day.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't measure the spices or cheeses, just eyeballed them.  I used 5 potatoes instead of 4 and 3T of oil was still a bit much too much.  My boyfriend was so excited to have potato skins for dinner!  I used turkey bacon and extra sharp cheddar.  A good use for the potato "middles" is just to toss with oil, salt and pepper and bake, it is a bit like home fries.

I have been making potato skins for 25+ years and thought I had it down to a science - until I tried this recipe.  This is SO very good - and so tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using garlic salt in place of regular salt, just for more garlic flavor.  Thank you so much for sharing this - it's now my ONLY way to fix potato skins!

i made this into an all day recipe beause i had the time.   baked the potatoes to take advantage of the heat the oven gave off, as opposed to turning the furnace up to heat the house.  baked extra potatoes for twice baked potatoes that were frozen for another meal.  tonight serving the skins with Green Chile Chicken burgers.  Saved the insides of what i needed for tonight to add to tuna for tuna patties (like salmon patties) later in the week

Excellent. I used a high heat smoke tolerant classic olive oil and coarse salt on the foil... what a stupendous flavor that added to an already great recipe. I also used left-over baked potatoes. (let's face it, my tween-agers; 20's; don't always come home for dinner like they promise!).

Love the potato skins! These will be a staple in our home for years to come. They are VERY filling. We made 6 potatoes for our family of 5 & still had 1/2 left over. So keep that in mind!

These were good, but not so "wow" that I would just rave about them.  The spices sort of slid off the potatoes onto the greasy pan, and they would've been a lot more tasty if they'd stayed on, because the parts that had spice were crispy and good.  We didn't have green onions, but they were good without them too.

Seriously....restaurant quality...these rocked out for my SuperBowl appys. Followed recipe exactley and they were perfect, crispy, and so very good. Only change was to use turkey bacon and low fat sour cream. A keeper!

everyone loved them, but i can't help feeling like i did something wrong. the taste wasn't there for me, nor was the crispyness i expect from potato skins. i've re-read the recipe a few times but still haven't figured out where i went wrong. i'll still give it 4/5 since everyone else (who are super picky and critical!) loved them!

I have always been a big fan of potatoe skins since I was a kid, this is by far just as great as ordering out, if not better. I, too, used olive oil instead of veg. oil and took another raters suggestion and baked the potatoe in foil after coating with melted butter and crushed sea salt. Will continue to use this recipe... thank you :)

These were great! My husband and I actually went out to eat one day at o'charleys and I tried their potatoe skins. they were yummy. So one day soon after he wanted more.I found this recipe and we made it. It was very easy to make and very good! I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes potatoes!

Perfect football watching food!  I served these cut in half with a scoop of sour cream in the middle.  They were gone in a flash.

Fantastic!  I stuck to the recipe other than starting the skins upside down for the first 7 mins, turned over, coated insides and edges then baked 7 more mins.  I did dab out any excess oil with a paper towel, then added cheddar and bacon bits, forgot the onion somehow!  They were still great.  I used the insides to make "Fried Potatoes" by Taste Of Home Test Kitchen, on this site.  Perfect way to use both parts and both are great recipes.  Thanks so much for sharing.

These are great!  I thought I would share what I did with my potato insides too.. I made Baked Potato Soup V with it and it was fabulous.  (I probably should share that I made the skins for a group and I tripled the recipe, and it seemed to be about the perfect amount for the soup.)  I then cooled the soup and put it in a freezer bag for dinner later on this month.  It is also a great recipe and the potatoes were already cooked and bacon already fried (the 2 steps I usually do not enjoy!)

I was shocked how much these taste like potato skins you'd get from a restaurant.  I omitted the bacon since I'm vegetarian, but did everything else according to recipe.  They fell apart a little when I was gutting them and brushing them with oil, but that is at least partly my ancient microwave's fault for not baking them very well.  Regardless, the finished product was delicious.

You will never be able to eat potato skins at a restaurant again!  I made 2 trays of 20 skins for a party, dropped 1 tray off at the party and had to run home 3 blocks away for the other tray.  By the time I got back, they were all gone!  Another great twist with these is to keep everything the same but substitue bleu cheese for cheddar in a few skins, and you'll have something for everybody

I have made these again and again for football parties and casual get togethers...everyone asks for them!  I have quadrupled the recipe even.  What I find is a really easy way to bake the potatoes, is to throw them in the microwave...cuts the time and is super easy.  Everyone loves these.  Thanks for the tasty recipe!

These were pretty darn good!  The only reason I docked it a star is because they are mega-greazy!!!  If you blot it at the end, the paper towel is DRIPPING with red oil, but I guess that's how they get nice and crispy...  I made it as written, BUT added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the skins just before the cheese and bacon.  Will DEFINITELY make again, but will experiment to find a way to reduce oil but still get a crispy result...  MAybe bake on a rack or broiling tray above a sheet pan so the oil has somewhere to go instead of puddling under the skins...

I have made these several times and they are always fabulous!  They taste as good or better than potato skins you'd get at a bar or restaurant.  I have even served these for dinner with a spinach salad on the side.  One of my allrecipes favorites!

OH MY!!!!!  The are absolutely outstanding.  For the potatoes before baking I followed another reviewer and rubbed butter on the skin, then put Sea Salt and Garlic (grinder method) on the skins, wrapped in foil and baked approx. 25 minutes at 475 deg.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  I didn't have any problem with greasiness at all.  I used a pastry brush and lightly basted the outside, turn over after the first 7 minutes and lightly basted again.  I can't believe how good these are. . . in fact I'm stuffing my face right now with one.   Thanks for the recipe, I don't have to wish for baked skins anymore, I doubt I will even order them at a restaurant, when I can make them right at home and THEY ARE BETTER than any restaurant I have had them in.

I loved these skins! Another idea with leftover potato-scoopings is to mix the scooped potato with butter, cut in about 2 T of garlic and herb cream cheese, warm milk and green onions and any other seasonings...chop/mix together with a fork...roll into balls.  I warmed a skillet with a small amount of garlic oil and placed the balls in when the oil was hot and formed into a patty.  I served my potato patties alongside with skins and other items for Superbowl!! Big hit!  (Don't count the calories...)

Oh my goodness these were good...and filling!  Wasn't sure about the oil mixture, my husband is quite picky, but it added so much to the skin side.  I served with sr cream, green onions, and shredded lettuce.  They were beautiful and decided they were better than the ones we love at one of the popular restaurants.  Thanks!

These were delicious!  I used bacon bits which was a big time saver. I also didn't have any green onions but I used the chives I had in my refrigerator.  I did this as a trial run & will definitely be making these for the Super Bowl next weekend!!

Very easy. I don't know how to cook, but the directions were very clear and concise. The skins were a HIT at my gathering; I served them with hot wings.

The first day i tried this i didn't have whole potatoes but did have the seasoned cut potatoes that come in a bag (the ones i got had butter and chives) from the frozen food section of the supermarket.  All i had to do was take the bag and put it in the microwave to heat up whats inside as what the directions on the bag said.  Then i put the potatoes on a baking pan and followed the rest of the receipe (however, all measurements I just eyed it).  When it was time to put the cheese on it, i took the potatoes off the baking pan and put them in a oven safe bowl with the cheese on top of them.  Once ready, i put sauteed onions (not too overcooked) and sour cream on top.  I have made this a couple of times already (as a side to an entree), and everyone who eats these, say its the best!

These are the same ones we make and love...with a few notable differences:  We use olive oild to LIGHTLY brush the skins (you only need a tbs of oil), then we broil them, not bake them.  Before we fill the skins, we shake some Lawrys Seasoned salt on the insides.  When we load them up, we also add onion with the bacon and cheese.  Sometimes, we'll also add jalapenos.  For those who found them without taste or 'boring'....try them again and let your imagination be your guide.  Bacon and cheese are just the launch point.  There is SO much you can do with these !!

Very good!  I microwaved my potatoes after cutting them in half (I didn't have the time or inclination to bake them in the oven) and I was afraid they'd be rubbery.  It was a bit harder to scoop out the pulp but it really didn't affect the final taste or texture.  I also didn't use all the bacon, it was a bit much for me (or maybe my potatoes were just too small).

My husband loved these.  You really need to crank up the heat, though.  I had the oven on at about 375 because I was also baking something else that needed a lower temp, so I had to leave the skins in for a much longer time.  Eventually I took my other dish out and just turned up the heat to 475.  They still turned out perfectly, even after all of that!

These turned out excellent! I will look no further for a potato skin recipe. I initially baked my potatoes for about 50 mins. at 375 degrees, and let cool before scooping out center. I did bake the skins about 12 mins each side instead of 7, they were so nice and crispy. The seasoned oil mixture adds wonderful flavor also. I filled some with "cheese whiz" simply because I ran out of cheddar. Very delicious with both cheeses. I topped with sour cream and chopped green onions, served with some salsa too. I will definitely use this recipe over and over. Such a hit, thanks :)

This was great, and so easy! I used butter instead of oil, and mashed the insides a little & put them back in (for more of a twice-baked-potato feel). I also used bacon pieces out of a bag and they turned out great. I will make this again & again. Thank you for the recipe!!!

I've made these twice! Cook times are perfect. I left out the salt the second time around and enjoyed them more (but I'm sort of a salt-hater, I'm learning). I used chives on top, since I didn't have any green onions. Very good. Going to try them with cayenne pepper added next time for a kick! Thanks!

I triple the batch for 5 people and they were all gone!  I used half olive oil & half butter and only doubled this amount.  I think even less could be used.  This was VERY GOOD, a new way to make potato's!

Always a crowd-pleaser. I always cook the potatoes in the microwave before scooping them. (Pierce all over with fork. 5 minutes on high, turn over, 5 more minutes on high.)

This is a great recipe to use when you also want Baked Potato Soup, using the scooped out potato.  I am making the Baked Potato Soup for a meal and will eat the potato skins through-out the week for snacks. I store the cooled potato skins in a container and take out as many as needed and I use butter or spray butter to coat the outside.  I dont think all the oil is necessary and I bake mine one time, with the filling of cheese & bacon.  They seem crisp enough but I might try the 'double' baking.  I add sour cream and green onions when they come out of oven. Very good!

VERY GOOD!  Plan on emailing everyone this recipe.  I actually think these are better than Friday's potato skins.

What a great recipe!  My husband came home and asked where'd you get these?  lol  I microwaved the potatoes first since I didn't have time to bake them, which worked out perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was so good.  I know some people said they were too oily. I baked them skin side down then after 7 min put them potato side down which drained the additional oil.  Anyway these are WAY better than any resturant skins!

I would give this recipe ten stars if I could!! Trish, you must have been a chef at Blank Angus as these are exactly like the ones they put out. I followed the recipe to the letter.  The hardest part for me was scooping out the potato to just the right amount to be left in the spud. With a nice salad, this could be a complete meal. Great recipe!!

I couldn't believe how good these were! They were very easy to make and my friends couldn't get enough of them. In all fairness, they are all starving college students. But the potato skins were still very delicious.

I love potato skins and used to make them all the time when I had a deep fryer and didn't watch my health.  I never attempted baked ones before because I didn't think they would come out very well.  I was WRONG!  I loved these and they are so simple to prepare!  Will make again and again!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Followed the recipe to the T and what a great treat these skins were! Actually I did do one thing different and that was to use real bacon bits from a jar as I didn't have any bacon in the house. **UPDATE** 8/31/12 Made this recipe again. Both times I used 8 small potatoes. Baked them wrapped in foil for an hour @ 350*. Cut in half and scoop out the shell. I doubled the rest of the recipe (don't scrimp on the Parm Extra won't hurt!) as there is more surface to cover during the final prep. I did this buy doing the 1st 7min bake with the shell facing up. I didn't do this the first time and ended up with a puddle of oil in the bottom. When you turn them over and do the 2nd bake with the shell down, it allows the oil to run out and bake up a little crispier. I mentioned cutting back some salt to my guest last night and they all said "no! Leave it as is!" So there ya go make it and make others happy!

These were wonderful!   They were crispy.  My daughter and husband loved them.  I put chives on mine along with fourcheese mexican blend (fancy shredded) only because that's what I had.  Love them!  The potato I scooped out and added chicken broth to them and 1 egg along with some of the four cheeseblend and made potato pancake.  Just add a little butter and olive oil to the pan for the pancake! Yum!!!  Making them again for friends tomorrow night.  This is a keeper

Amazing! I am a potato junkie and these were the BEST potato skins I've ever had. I have Celiac Disease and often can't eat potato skins at restaurants. When a craving hit me, I thought I would give these a try. I savored every bite and can't wait to make these again!

As someone that is home away from home right now and cooking for the first time, this recipe is genius. It's simple, but the end product is a definite snack/appetizer that I will be making in the future. Instead of a baking sheet, I used aluminum foil shaped into a dish, and 2 tbls extra virgin + 1 tbls unsalted melted butter were used. No parmesan and cayenne instead of paprika. Delicious!

FYI baking a potato does NOT require tin foil-- using tin foil creates a steamed potato. Bake potatoes sit in an oven for about 40 mins at 375 degrees, coated in either butter, oil, pam, or a mixture of both. This is the best way to get crispy skin.

That being said-- this is the absolute easiest and best recipe I've come across for potato skins. I've literally been using it for years with minor mods for flavor, caloric accommodation, etc. Make sure you BAKE the potatoes instead of steaming them!

It was very tasty without all the guilt from deep-frying.  I baked the potatoes in the microwave to make it easier. Definitely will make it again.

I made these for a BBQ potluck. I was about a half an hour late because I wanted to make sure they were ready just as I was leaving so they'd still be warm and crispy. They were gone in about five minutes! Everyone loved them!

For the potatoes, I rubbed them with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt before baking. I also made them the day before so they'd be cool enough to handle when I needed to.

These were great! I did 6 potatoes so I doubled the spice rub and almost didn't have enough. The spice rub is the key to the recipe. I did like other reviewers & brushed the skin side with the spices and baked then flipped and brushed the potato side & baked. This gave them a nice crispy flavorful texture. I will definitely make these again!

Loved this recipe as written the first time I made it.  Last week, however, I didn't have several of the ingredients on hand so I made my own (also very yummy) variation.  Instead of the bacon and cheddar cheese, I substituted cut up leftover ham (from Easter), sliced black olives, mozzarella cheese, and green chiles.   I added all four for the last two minutes and it was delicious.   A great recipe as is, and a great recipe to play with.

I'm not a potato skin eater, but with 3 sons who are, this was a big hit.  I used it as an appetizer and made garlic mashed potatoes with the dinner.  By adding garlic roasted in alittle olive oil and some heavy cream mixed with the scooped out potatoes, was great.

The better the potato the better the skins come out. Everyone thinks they take a lot of work but honestly they are easy to make.

Followed recipe to the T, and these were ok, maybe I left to much potato in them? Will attempt again, hopefully with better results.

SIMPLY AMAZING!!! Not sure if this has been posted previously...Might seem obvious to most, but, be sure to allow additional prep time to bake the potatoes (!!!) 1.5 hours @ 350, 1 hour @ 400, 40 minutes @ 450.  After washing/pricking, I have always covered my potatoes with vegetable shortening prior to baking. For a spicier skin, kick it up a notch by substituting 2 teaspoons of an Emeril-type spice blend for the salt/garlic/paprika/pepper mixture.

These were awesome-my husband even said that they were the best potato skins he ever had. The only thing I did different was I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil. I brushed the skin part of the potato first and baked for 7 mins then when I flipped them over I brushed the inside and baked for another 9 mins (until nice and crispy). I also did not grease my cookie sheet and they did not stick.

So easy and wonderfully delicious! I did use some of the substitutes mentioned in other reviews (olive oil vs. veg oil, bacon bits vs. crumbled bacon), and I added my own due to what I lacked in my pantry! I have no paprika, so I subbed Lawrey's seasoned salt for both the salt and the paprika. REALLY great flavor! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making these, again.

Delicious! A bit of wrk to make, but wrth it. I made these on Super Bowl Sunday. Didn't have time to wait for them to bake, so I popped the potatoes in the microwave for ten minutes, then baked for appr. 20 minutes. Used butter instead oil and cheddar/monterey jack mix. Everyone loved them! The we're even good the next day - just microwaved them for a about a minute on medium power. Hubby said they tasted better than any he's ever had at a restaurant. Will definitely make again!

These were so good!   I baked the potatoes and was tired, so I put the in the fridge to make the skins the next night.  I did, and they were great!!  So easy, and so good!  And good to know that I can bake the potatoes the night before and make them really quickly when I am ready for them!  Thanks for the recipe!

these were amazing! The only thing i did different is used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I did bake 7 min with potato halves face down then 7 face up then with a paper towel collected the little puddles of oil before putting on cheese, onions and bacon.

Mmmmmmmm so great!  The olive oil shell on the skin was a great flavor and there's really no way to mess up with measurements for this recipe.  You just put the toppings you want, however much you want.  Good !

We liked these a lot!  I did my baking and scooping in the morning and refrigerated them until dinner.  I found that if I ran a sharp knife into the flesh of the cooked potato, about 1/4" from the skin, the potato scooped out very easily leaving just enough potato on the skin.  I’ll make these again!  Thank you!

These are fabulous!!   I'd say they are equal to the ones at our favorite restaurant.  BTW, if you want to make them more substantial... you can also add shredded chicken and a little BBQ sauce to the filling. When we first had them at the restaurant with BBQ I didn't think I would like it - now I prefer them that way!   Thank you for an outstanding recipe.

I didn't take out any potato "pulp" and just made potato "halves" so they'd be healthier (they weren't fat potatoes anyway). Next time I'll just brush the seasonings on the tops (not on the skin), but otherwise they were a big hit!

Loved and devoured by my entire family. Baked my potatoes on 290 for 90 minutes with the skin thoroughly cleaned and rubbed with olive oil and sea salt.

These are great! At first, I wasn't sure how to scoop out the potato. Then after a few tries, I did it perfect.  Slice the potato in half as stated in the recipe. Next,using a steak knife, gently slice down from one end to the other(Be sure not to cut through the skin).Then going the opposite way, slice down the potato...making a cris-cross.

YUM!  These tasted just like skins I would order at a restaurant.  To bake the potatoes I rubbed the potatoes with olive oil, placed them on a baking sheet and baked for 1 hour.  After they cooled off I continued with the recipe.  The only thing I changed was to broil the skins instead of just bake them. (about 5 minutes per side with the rack about 5 inches away).

This is a wonderful recipe and was delicous. However, I had not idea that potato skins took so long! I won't be making them again because they take quite a while to make. Recipe is wonderful though!!

YUM!  These were excellent!!  Very flavorful!  Made one potato per person and followed the recipe exactly.  We did bake them quite a bit longer in order to get them to our desired crispiness, but other than that the recipe was perfect as is!  I baked the potatoes up the night prior, let them cool and stored them in the fridge overnight.  I also cooked and crumbled the bacon the night before.  Doing these two things ahead of time saved a lot of time the day of.  Definitely my new go to recipe for potato skins!

these are amazing! crisp and flavorful.  i used olive oil instead of veg. oil, bacos instead of bacon.  used only 2 potatoes (just the two of us) and all the oil mixture, so if i was going to make 4 potatoes i would double the oil mixture.

EXTREMELY greasy-had to drain oil off after the first 7 min bake & then set on paper towel & blotted as much oil as I could off. They never crisped & tasted a lot like frozen, pre-packaged skins. Too much work & too many ingredients hiding the potato. Sorry, just wasn't impressed, but obviously, a lot of other people love them!

This is a fantastic recipe, so simple and delicious. Bac-O-Bits make it (ovo-lacto) vegetarian, and smoked paprika heightens the flavor. I'm very excited that I can make this snack for myself and friends at the drop of a hat.

Loved this! The oil and spices on the skins really make this dish, they were crunchy and delicious! Made it for the super bowl and everyone loved it. I did add a little potato back into the skin with the bacon mixed, with butter... YUM! It turned it into a sort of twice baked potato/potato skin.

Absolutely delicious! Really simple to make and a fun treat to make! I followed recipe exactly, no bacon though just because I didn't have any, and it turned out fabulous. There wasn't a crumb left!

The ingredients are confusing. This was my first time making them. The creator is assuming as a cook you'd know to cook the potato first. I did but not everyone will

These were very good.  I made them without the bacon because I didn't have any on hand and they were still delicious.

Oh my these were DEEEE-LISH!!! I made these on New Year's Eve, but I did use OLIVE OIL and I pretty much doubled the ingredients because that is just how I roll! I used Russet 'taders and they were big, so I cut them in half lengthwise and then in thirds, I cannot wait to make these again! Oh, I also used the BAG of Mexican blend cheese. The next day I was craving them again, but they were GONE, of course, so I had some red potatoes that had been cooked in the microwave and I cut those in half and made us more. I think they were even more delish w/the red potatoes! This was so perfect, Trish, thanks for sharing your recipe! I wanted to do potato skins and these were out of this world! Mmmm mmmm!! (The next day we had sour cream AND avo dip on the side - oh HOLLUH!!!)  Happy New Year!

These were just okay. Not worth trying to make again. If you're not a fan of garlic powder you shouldn't try this recipe. Next time I'll just brush these with some oil and salt.

These are the absolute best potato skins in the entire world. I love them soooooo much...even without sourcream! I tend to leave out the onion though because my friends don't like them very much but other than that, I followed everything else. I've received many great comments on them.

Very yummy!  I followed the directions exactly.  The only thing I would change next time would be to not put the seasoning on the outside of the skins.  It just made them messy.

Came out to be very tasty. My only complaint would be that they are pretty greasy.  Next time I would reduce the amount of oil I use to still get the crispy outside, but cut down on the grease.

I must say that I didn't get the hype when potato skins became so popular an item at restaurants. Being a little bored of my regular sides, I thought these might be a nice change. After one bite everyone was eyeing the serving dish with intentions of 2nd helpings. Great recipe. Thanks Trish Perrin.

Delicious! The skins crisp up nicely and the seasonings are great!  I didn't use bacon because I didn't have any on hand, but with the seasonings, all the potatoes need are some cheese and sour cream and they are even better than the ones served at TGI Friday's!

My mother introduced me to this recipe, and since I introduced the girlfriend too them, she's even demanded that we have them a few times.  They're great; far and away better than any restaurant skins.  The baste for them is a great touch.

Very good recipe. Everyone at the party raved about them. I microwaved the potatoes before baking to speed things up. Next time the only thing I would change would be less garlic salt as they were a little to salty for my taste, but no one else said anything.

These turned out okay for me.  Not sure where I went wrong.  Maybe I erred too much on the side of caution and left too much potato in the skin?  I might try them again.

I recently had a party and made a platter of these.  They were gone by the time I turned around.  I made them as directed except used bacon grease to brush the skins.  They were pretty as a picture, bad for the waist, but oh so good to the mouth!

Its impossible to make too many. They're gone in a flash. Used small idaho potatoes instead of the big ones, still worked great. Also used the Monterey jack/Colby cheese mix. Yum.

I followed this recipe exactly.  All my guests, family and children raved about it.  It is a whole lot better than what you get at a restaurant!  I will definitely be making these at next years super bowl and any other get together.  They are even good cold.  The only thing I suggest is using thick sliced bacon.  I believe that it holds more flavor.

How can you not LOVE this recipe?  BAKE your potatoes first.  I then prepped them exactly as directed, and waited for them to cool before adding cheese/bacon/green onion.  I brought along to friend's super bowl party, loaded them up with the good stuff, popped them in the oven until they were melted and voila!  I cut them into quarters for more bite-sized pieces.  Leftover potatoes... mashed them with some cheese and bacon, and then made "potato puffs"... I dropped them on the "Pillsbury Creations" pastry dough, cut into twelve pieces, folded up, and baked until golden.  Delicious!

Could be a 5 but I had no bacon and I cooked them in an oven which is a hassle to me. Bonus is they taste as good as restaurants and you will always have enough sour cream!!

So delicious!  Great family friendly meal, we added a green salad and voila!  I used olive oil, lowfat cheese and turkey bacon to make it more health conscious and it was super yummy!  Crispy outside and moist inside- we have always microwaved them and have used this on older- a tad soft -potatoes and this recipe is a savior for those!

Thanks for a great recipe!!  My husband and I enjoyed this for a football game and they were great, just the perfect amount of  crispiness and baking time. Not to mention, you can have a nice bowl of mashed potatoes (left from the pulp)to add to the table   I will definately be making this recipe for many years to come thank  you! :-)

These skins are exceptional--I inhaled all four potatoes worth when I made them.  The oil brushing gives them a perfect amount of crispness and the additiona of paprika gives them that great seasoned appearance.  Next time I make them, however, I will half the salt or omit it altogether.  With the cheeses and bacon, there is plenty of salt and flavor.  Writing this little review is making me crazy hungry.

These potato skins were better than any I have ever had in a restaurant!  I used a little more bacon than what the recipe called for, but only because my husband loves bacon.  This recipe is going in the front of my recipe book.  :)

Very good.  I used both a large baking potato and smaller potato's and I think we liked the smaller one's better.  Easier to eat and they didn't break apart like some of the bigger one's did.  I made them up ahead...baked the potato's scooped out the potato, seasoned them and baked them again.  I then let them cool and put them in fridge.  Right before I served them, popped them into the oven to heat them up a bit, then filled with the cheese and other goodies, and back into the oven.  They turned out really good.  I bet they would be great with chili in them for superbowl.  Will make them again I'm sure.

These were so good! I loved the seasoning on the outside of the skins I did microwave the potatoes before cooking and did as others did and coated the bottom first then flipped and coated the inside. They were perfect!!

I made these exactly as Trish's recipe showed and they were GREAT.  All right, I did use Hormel's real bacon bits instead of frying up bacon but other than that I used the recipe without making lots of changes.  They great part is I made it up to taking the skins out of the oven and putting them on paper towels and then I didn't need to finish them by adding the cheese and bacon for a few hours.  When it was time, I just popped them in the oven for about 10 minutes and voila. I must say that there is no shame in baking potatoes in the microwave.  As long as you crisp up the skins in the oven at 475 for about 5 minutes you really cannot tell the difference.  I always do it.

These rock!  I can't remember the last time I had potato skins.  I didn't use the oil, just sprayed with PAM.  Even my picky DS liked them.  I will make again.

I followed others advice in EVOO and blotting out inside prior to adding the cheese. I made 24 halves for 5 people and they were enjoyed by all.  Everyone of them. So much healthier and cheaper than the restaurant. Thank you for the recipe.

I have now made this twice, once for my family 4th of July get-together and then for a baby shower.  These were a great success with both groups.  They were eaten up quickly both times.  I used the "perfect baked potato" recipe from this site to bake the potatoes.  I always serve the sour cream on the side because not everyone likes it.

I tried this recipe the way it was written and it was very good, but I kept reworking it and finally came up with my favorite variation.  I make the oil mixture and coat the outsides of the potatoes as written but double the amount of parmesan and garlic powder.  However, I keep the scooped out middles to stuff back into the potatoes later.  While the potatoe skins are cooking for the first 7 minutes, I put the potato goop that I'd scooped out into the bowl that had the oil-garlic mixture, stir it up, and add in 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and the bacon (bacon is optional).  I then stir in 1/4-1/2 cup cream of chicken.  I don't use sour cream (personal preference).  After the skins have cooked for 7 minutes, I restuff them with the potato mixture, top with a little bit of pepperjack cheese, and bake them for another 7-10 minutes.  Trust me, it's fabulous!

These turned out perfect. I subbed onion powder for garlic powder due to personal tastes. Otherwise I made exactly as stated and it tasted just like a restaurant appetizer, maybe even better.

This was great fun to do with my pre-teen! However, due to time, we baked the potatoes one day and made them into skins the next.

These are absolutely delicious! Better than any restaurant can make. I made these, along with a salad, as a light dinner. My 2-year-old and 4-year-old loved them. I would definitely make these the next time I have guests over for a casual dinner.

Very tasty. The seasoning is perfect for this crunchy potato skin. I usually cook for a family of four, but cooked just for myself tonight, and this was perfect. Like another viewer, I microwaved my one potato for 8 min. After scooping inside, I brushed on seasoning and baked the outside of the potato before the inside. I didn't have green onions, but it was still yummy. The brushed on seasoning mixture is what made this recipee a winner for me!

Yum!!  We don't usually indulge with restaurant potato skins.  When we saw this home baked version we had to give it a try.  They were delicious!  I will be making these again!  However, next time I will double the oil mixture.  I felt I didn't have enough to cover the entire potatoes to my satisfaction.  Enjoy!

So good... I like to make with the "Perfect Baked Potato" recipe from this site. The salty skin is absolutely delicious. A must for hockey and football games.

Microwaved my potatoes and they weren't even all the way done when they came out. They were a little hard to scoop but managed. I hoped they would finish cooking in the oven and they did - BEAUTIFULLY! I used a cooking pan with holes in the bottom so I did not need to turn the potatoes - I just put them in for 14 minutes (instead of 7 then turn and another 7). When they came out, I did use a paper towel to bloat any standing oil. Wonderful flavor. Will make again - soon!

These are really good! I did something a little different. I use really big potatoes and it take a long time in the oven. So I pop 2 big potatoes in the microwave for 10 mins., slice them in half put the toppings on them after they are out the microwave (except the sour cream) and place then in the toaster over at 400 degrees for 3 mins. 

Taste just as good, but uses less energy. :)

I loved these potato skins when I made them.  The oil spice mixture gives them a nice flavor and crispiness.  Add some cayenne pepper for a kick! YUM!

These were great even just with the oil/spice blend.  I made several 'all the way' and several 'plain' with just the oil/spice blend and both were a hit !  Thanx!

Very yummy! My family really enjoyed these. I followed the recipe almost as written. The only addition was some sliced black olives.  I will be making these for a lot of occasions. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

These came out perfect.  They are nice and crispy.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and six small potatoes instead of 4 large.  Next time I will have to make more.  These flew off the table.  We had to ration them out.

These were probably the best potato skins I’ve ever had. Only thing I did differently was I used the new Velveeta cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese. And we topped with bacon sour cream the cheese sauce and jalapeños. So so good!

Have made this recipe countless times; fabulous flavor.  Bake potatoes day ahead, scoop out middles, start with them facing up/scooped side up - this allows excess oil to drip out when flipped and baked on other side.  We make this often when having young adults as guests, huge hit. Pairs well with chicken and a salad. Helps to have bacon made ahead of time too, I keep some in freezer, cooked and ready to go just for this recipe.

Been making this a while and have added some "healthy twists" and short cuts. I keep a wide-mouth jar of the oil mixture in frig, warm it up a bit to use and just dip the hollowed out red)potato halves in it to coat. Also I chop bacon b4 cooking and skip crumbling.   Saute chopped greens (whatever you have...chard, spinach, sweet potato are great also) and cherry tomatoes briefly in bacon fat after bacon is cooked. Spoon greens into potatoes first then top with cheese and bacon.  When done, top with greek yogurt instead of sour cream and chopped cilantro.  These are a hit for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  THANKS...

These tasted better than most at restraunts.  I did throw the potatoes in the microwave prior to baking in the oven as I was short on time, but my family loved them and has already requested them again.  Thanks for sharing a great, easy recipe!

I baked potatoes in oven 1st. Let them cool. Split potatoes in 1/2. Scraped pulp out to have that for next meal. I mixed oil, I used extra virgin olive oil. I added all spices plus parsley & a little cumin. I only brushed the insides & baked for 8 more minutes. Perfect crunch. The bacon I used was the pre-cooked Hormel bacon & I put my cheese on them. Baked for 8 minutes. YUM! We loved them, Thanks!

These skins had a very nice flavor. The mixture that is brushed on the skins is very nice. I baked the potatos in the microwave and they didn't turn out very crunchy at all. Next time I will bake them in the oven.

I made these last weekend and everyone was raving that these were they best potato skins they ever had. I baked 4 potatoes the night before, scooped them out and then let them chill in the fridge over night. Only complaint I have is there was a lot of grease swimming in the pan while baking them.

My boyfriend and I wanted to try this recipe and it turned out better than I thought! This recipe is quite easy and quick :0) The only thing is that I thought the amount of oil as stated was not needed. You only use the oil to lightly brush all sides of the potato; I still had half a bowl of oil left. However, this is a great recipe and I would definitely make this again!

These had a lot of flavor.  I brought them to a party and got some good reviews.  But I found them a bit greasy for my own taste.  Not sure if I'll make this again.

Wow...these were fabulous.  Quick and easy.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave.  Used pre-cooked bacon.  Left the onions off to suit my family's taste.  Just like one's we get at our favorite restaurant!

Took this to our family's Christmas where everyone does appetizer type food, for the most part.  Everyone really enjoyed them and the best part was I didn't have any leftovers.

Wow, was really surprised how good they were.  They practically disappeared instantly at the St. Paddy's Day party I brought them to, and I doubled the recipe. Used large baking potatoes. Did all the initial baking steps at home.  Took the cooked shells to the party, where I filled with cheese and bacon, baked again, adding green onions close to the end of baking time.  To serve these I cut each half into 3 pieces. Nice size bite.  Yum!  Otherwise followed directions. Next time might serve them with salsa along with the sour cream.

This turned out great and was a big hit at the party I made them for.  The potato skins were very good a different from regular dips and other appetizers.  The only downside....took me ALL DAY to make and my kitchen looked like a bomb went off in it.  Maybe I just don;t have the right kitchen gadgets but it literally took me all day.

Yum! Better than restaurant potato skins! I made oil/spice mix exactly as written & the flavor was excellent! I did have to cook them a few minutes longer than the 7 mins/side and even they they were only semi-crisp.  But that could be because I left too much potato in them - my husband loved it that way! I made the bacon while they cooked, so it didn't really feel like an extra step.  Topped them with sour cream mixed with a 1/2 packet of ranch seasoning & they were outstanding! Definitely a make-again!!

These are great! Of course I made a few healthful revisions for my vegetarian diet. :-)  I used MorningStar's veggie "Bacon", olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and only about 3/4 cup of low-fat cheese (just put less in each skin), and fat-free sour cream. They were a super hit! Thanks!

These were insanely easy and everyone loved them. I baked the potatoes the day before and brought them to room temp to scoop them. They came out even better after I reheated them the next day.

After pulping out the baked potato, use the leftover potato "meat" and mix it with the sour cream and toppings. It's wonderful. Dont add anymore salt than it calls for. And always cook the potato in the oven. Microwaves are for mac n cheese

fantastic! Like some suggested, I blotted the excess oil before putting on cheese and bacon.  Really good flavor, great after school snack.

Look no more! We Loved these! I was looking for a snack for my kids when they had friends over. These are something that I always have items on hand for and so they are cheaper than frozen snacks! I baked the potatoes but you can also microwave them to save time.  My teenager kids and their friends LOVED them! Thank you!!

Very simple and tasty.  They were a hit at the Super Bowl party!  I made both with and without bacon (without for the vegetarians) and used smoked paprika for a little added flavor.  Very yummy!

Look through the directions beforehand.  This recipe takes more than 20 minutes to prepare.  But, oh my gosh, they're delicious.  Our vegetarian guest approved the bacon-less version.

Great Recipe - I also used olive oil. Husband is not a big fan of potato skins but said these tops the ones he has eaten in restaurants.

Very nice but I do the potatoes a bit differently; I bake all my potatoes first and then cut them in halves and scoop them out.  That way I can also use the scooped out part to make a baked potato salad, or fluff them up by beating them for baked/mashed potatoes the next day. LOVE THE CRISPY of this recipe!

We loved this recipe. I baked in my convection oven and they were so crisp in no time. The flavor of this baked skin was almost as awesome as the stuff that went inside. Thanks for posting.

This recipe rocks!!!!  I brought these for a new year's eve party and they were gone in a flash.  I didn't have baking potatoes, but used smaller ones instead which worked just fine.  Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I used the pre-cooked bacon, simply chopping it up and then finishing it off in the oven as directed in the recipe.  These were FANTASTIC!

I used olive oil and kosher salt and did not meaure but rather eyeballed generously and these were a huge hit esp with my college aged football watching sons. I have made them a few times and the higher heat to bake them at does make a difference. One time we were hungry and couldnt wait til they were as crispy as they should be and they weren't nearly as yummy.

My mom said these were the BEST potato skins she has ever had.  I microwaved the potatoes and they were still excellent.  Next time I will not use the parmesan cheese in the spread because it just burned on the pan, but besides that I will make it as is!!!

THESE ARE UNREAL!  I used smaller potatoes instead of large ones, and really liked the effect - the size made for a much better "appetizer" feel.  Wow, really I cannot say enough about how amazing these are!

Sooooo good! I left too much potato inside the skin so it took me a lot longer for it to crisp. Now I know how much potato to take out.

Potato skins are my favorite!! Instead of bacon i reccommend trying some ham. Just get deli ham, fry it up for just a minute to get off extra juices...and use that instead of bacon.....soo good!!!

These were great, and not too much trouble.  Just have to think far enough ahead to bake the potatoes.  I did not have any parm cheese so I had to leave that out of the recipe and I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  They were great!  Will definately be making them again.

These were definitely good, but not quite as amazing as I had hoped for.  They never quite got to "crispy" for me....  Probably something I did wrong.

Wow!  This is one of my all time favorite recipes from this site.  And that's saying something since I get most of my recipes from here!  This recipe is a bit time-consuming, but I promise you WILL NOT be disappointed with the results.  These are better than restaurant quality since you have complete control over what you put on top.  Don't skimp on anything in the oil/spice/cheese coating, and don't change the cooking time/method.  Those are the keys to success with this recipe.  You will impress whoever is lucky enough to partake in these fantastic potato skins.

I've tried, with little success, making potato skins in the past. These were fairly painless and turned out perfect!  I omitted the green onions and added a little cayenne to the "marinade". Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy!  I baked the potatoes in the morning and finished them on the BBQ.  I crisped them up on the grill bottom down then flipped them, then flipped them again and topped with cheese (didn't have bacon but I bet they would be even better).  Served with sour cream.  Very tasty.

I have pre-cooked the potatoes both ways, I cooked them in the oven for an hour, and I also tried the microwave "cheat."  Using the microwave works if you're caught in a pinch for time, but the difference in the result between baking the potatos in the oven vs heating them up in the microwave is probably a 4 star recipe vs a 5 star.  Use the oven if you can help it.  I love the paprika flavor that comes through on these.  As an additional garnishment I would suggest some fresh pico de gallo.

My kids and I really enjoyed this (8-18).  I can tell you from a previous attempt, the potatoes are difficult to scoop if you under-cook them.  I did them in the microwave and checked with a digital meat thermometer to make sure they were at 210 degrees F.  We will make again for sure.  Saving the innards for some little fried potato patties another night.

AMAZING!! This recipe was so yummy! I loved the seasoning mixture that was brushed over the skins before putting them in the oven.  The flavor was excillent.  The only thing I'll probably change next time is the amount of cheese...I LOVE cheese so I'm probably going to use more.  Thank you for this terrific recipe!!

I first made these for my New Year's Eve party and they were a hit, even with a few picky eaters.  They're a little time consuming, but worth it.  I baked the potatoes in the microwave, which worked out just fine.

YUM! Better taste than restaurant skins. I first took 4 small raw potatoes, poked them with a knife and microwaved them for 11 minutes instead of baking them beforehand. I followed this rest of the recipe and they were awesome! You could not even tell they were microwaved. Great flavor!!

Yumm! My husband, kids and I loved this! It came out very good, but I did use less oil than called for at the advice of others. They were just like in the restaurant, but a lot cheaper! I will definitely be making these again!

I mixed the spices with a little bit of oil and brushed it on.  This made it less oily.  Before I flipped the potatoes, I blotted them.  Yummy!

YUM! I baked the potatoes 3/4 in the microwave first. Then finished them off in the oven to harden the skin. I put the oil/seasoning mixture on the insides of the potato but didn't bother w/ the outside. Baked about 11 minutes till got brown. Topped w/ cheese, bacon and sour cream. Delicious! I'll make it again for sure.

These were tasty but I think my own spin on them is what threw them off a little. I softened the potatoes in the microwave as suggested to save on time. I also used the "real bacon" bits which worked just fine. I was making mine as an appetizer with a mexican-style meal, so I added some chili powder before adding the cheese and bacon. I also provided sour cream and salsa for dipping. Just be sure that after you add the cheese and bacon, only put them in the oven long enough to melt the cheese!! I got busy and left them in there longer and the cheese came out kind of crunchy. Also, this recipe makes A LOT of the wedges, so be sure you have a party to feed or you'll have way too many leftovers like I did! In all, a great recipe to build from!

Baked mine in the microwave for about 10 minutes. Scooped the inside out, sprayed skins with Pam and sprinkled with salt.  Followed the rest of the directions as stated and these came out wonderful!  My family loved them and it was a good change from the usual mashed potatoes.  My two year old ate the filling with diced ham.

These were good but they were not as crispy as I had hoped for.  Maybe I should have baked them a bit longer in the oven.  I also found them to be a bit oily.  I will make again but with less oil.

These were so easy to make!  I made it exactly like the recipe said.  The only comment I would have is the oil mixture you put on the potato was maybe a little salty you don't need very much of it.  I'll be making these again.

These were amazing!  I left out the Parmesan cheese simply because my husband is allergic, but you'd never know anything was missing!  Definitely as good (husband said "better") than any restaurant!  Three year old daughter loved them too!  It was a great addition to our super casual Valentine dinner!

We enjoyed these while watching Super Bowl XLIII and they were a huge hit!  When baking I baked them open side up and then open side down, this allowed any collected oil/grease to drain.  I think that baking the potatoes a day ahead is a great idea!

I've never made homemade potato skins before, but this recipe sounded so easy and good. It met all my expectations! Very, very good! My son thought they were a tad too salty, but I did not.

These were good, I used small red potatoes and cooked them in the microwave first.  I was worried about the skins not being thick enough to hold up to all the scooping. Except for a couple of splits while they were cooking, most of them turned out really good and were easy to scoop!  I put a little feta in a couple with the cheddar just to see what they tasted like.  Naturally they were AWESOME!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

These were great!  So much easier then I expected.  I cooked the bacon earlier in the day so that I had that part done when I was ready for it. We had them New Years Eve and the company really enjoyed them too!

The skins didn't turn out as crispy as I would have preferred, and I baked them longer than the 14 min. suggested. They were still very good, though, and still deserved five stars. The oil coating has a really good flavor to it. I used shredded co-jack cheese, freshly cooked and crumbled bacon, sour cream, and I threw some cut up pieces of jalapeno slices on top. A bit time consuming if you bake the potatoes in the oven instead of microwave (I've only baked them in the oven so far), but worth it.

I have to honestly say that these were not as good as the ones I normally make that call for the skins to be fried in oil rather than baked. However, they are a tasty alternative to and have fewer calories than my normal version. I really liked the addition of green onions, which I added to the skins at the same time as the cheese so that they cooked a bit in the oven.

We make these all the time! They are delicious and can actually be a meal. Our eight year old son loves them! My husband and I like them a little spicier so we add a few drops of Tapatio sauce after putting all the other toppings on. We apply the oil mixture to the insides of the potato only, we like the flavor/texture of the skin without the oil. We microwave the potatoes instead of bake them as we can never wait long enough for them to bake! Excellent recipe, always a winner.

These were easy and good. I found out after baking the potatoes that I did not have green onions which would have made these even better. I used cheese, tomatoes, bacon and sour cream. The shells were good and crispy with great taste!

Wow - Delicious! These really are just like you get at a restaurant/bar. I used 4 large red skin potatoes and followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I'll absolutely make these again - especially for football Saturdays.

I made these for "Football Sunday" and paired them with wings.  They were awesome!!! Everyone LOVED them and agreed that they were the best potato skins they had ever had!  The oil brushed on the skins, makes ALL the difference!  They are so crispy, that you would think they were fried!  Definately a keeper!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!!!!

These were good! I found these to be a bit bland the first time I made them, but adding 1/4 tsp garlic salt definitely enhanced the flavor this time. I like to use Smart Balance butter instead of oil, and put a generous amount of the mix on the inside of the potato and only spray the outside with a little Pam. It makes eating them a lot less messy. Thanks for the recipe!

I added a couple of tablespoons of taco seasoning to the sour cream before placing it on the potatoes.  Instead of using garlic powder, I used minced garlic and let that sit in the olive oil.  I also doubled the oil/spice mixture because it is so tasty. This was a great dish!

These were ok. I'm not sure if I would make it again, but if I did I would want to add something to give it a bit more flavor.

Thanks for this one- it was great.  I used 2 tbsp veg oil and 1 tbsp olive oil- otherwise followed exactly.  They turned out perfect and tasted very good.  This was just what I was looking for.

Very very tasty! Highly recommended. I ate all the bacon this morning so I just used bacon bits and it tasted great.

Excellent recipe, you'd think these would be a no brainer to make, but I never thought of brushing the skins with oil/spices and crisping them up before adding the toppings. thanks!

Delicious! Needed more of the oil/spice rub on the outside of my potatoes but made do. Used a mixture of mild cheddar, extra sharp cheddar, and a little shredded mozz. I had in the fridge. Doubled the bacon for extra "mmm"...takes a little longer than stated b/c the potatoes have to bake ahead of time but well worth the wait

Really yummy!  I put the sour cream and onions in a separate dish as my husband isn't too keen on sour cream.  He added his own accompaniment of baked beans!

The best recipe I have ever tried for potato skins.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of oil b/c it's what I had on hand, and then I poured the remaining butter mixture over the pulp that I had scooped out.  It was amazing!  The parmesan really makes this recipe.

There were YUMMY!  I've made homemade potato skins before that involved deep frying them, but these taste just the same. And no mess!  We will be making these for parties - or on nights when we just want to have appetizers for dinner!

I cut the potatoes into 4 parts to make them a little easier to handle, but that was just personal preference.

Good, I've made these several times. I just spray the skins with olivce or butter flavor cooking spray. I also use real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon. I usually serve with sour cream sprinkled with the green onion as a dip rather than topping them individually.

these were really good. we took them to our friends' house for our weekly get together and everyone loved them. 

my husband dabbed out a bit of the excess oil before we cooked them... and as recommended by others, we baked them upside down first.

a great snack. we will definitely make these again soon.

They were very good not as crispy as I had hoped for.  I microwaved them so maybe that made the difference.  I may try broiling them next time.

Made these for the super bowl and they were the first appetizer gone. So good, and don't skip the oil with herbs on the skins because that makes it finger licking good.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder because thats what I had on hand and then cut down on the salt so it wasn't too much.  They were good pretty good but nothing extraordinary. I'd make them again because they were so easy.

As other reviewers suggested, I microwaved potatotes for 10 minutes first, then let cool. This made it much easier to scoop out the middle. I melted and then brushed potato skins with Smart Balance Butter. I baked at 7 minutes, each side, at toaster oven temp 450. I used mozzarella cheese and turkey bacon for filling (cooked and crumbled bacon first), then re-baked for 5 minutes. Very good and easy to make.

These were EXCELLENT, they tasted just like restaurant skins.  I served them for a football party and they were one of the first things to go.

These were very good.  Next time I won't bother with cooking my own bacon and will use bacon bits instead.  I followed the suggestions of the last reviewer and they weren't greasy at all.

I made these for a party and they were gone very quickly.  These are better than what you can get in a restaraunt.

These were great!  Very flavorful and yummy.  I just had a bunch of small potatoes, so I used those (made them just a bit bigger then bite sized).  I cooked them in the microwave and then scooped them out.  I also used bacon bits instead of making my own bacon (MUCH easier).  I will definitly make these again.

These came out great!  I made them for my hubby's bday as a treat during football - he's pretty picky and he thought they were excellent.  I increased the ingredients just a bit because I used 6 potatoes instead of 4.  Thanks for submitting this! Will make again for sure!

I cooked these in the microwave and used bacon bits so it was pretty easy.  I reduced the oil to 2 Tbl and still found them pretty greasy.  We had them last night with dinner and my husband asked if we could have them again tonight.

This was so good.  I also used the microwave and it cuts more than half the time.  Then I add the cooked halved potatoes in the oven as followed.  Only thing is I used butter instead of oil as I read somewhere that is how TGIf does it.

Great recipe!  So yummy and EASY!  When I first tasted the oil mixture I didn't think it would have enough kick but the flavors come right out after baking.

Loved this recipe.  I was looking for a great potatoe skins recipe and this is it!  Thanks so much for sharing.

For dipping, I used reduced fat sour cream and added some curry powder, dry yellow mustard and cayenne.

Very very tasty! Restaurant quality. The only change I had was using chives instead of green onions, as I have chives in my herb garden. Would make for guests.
