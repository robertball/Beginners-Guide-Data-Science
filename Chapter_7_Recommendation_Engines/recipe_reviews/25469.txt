All I can say is "Wow!".  Seeing fish sauce in the ingredients made me wonder, but am I ever glad I tried this.  Even though I messed up and marinated for 36 hours cause I got busy elsewhere, this is one of the best, if not the best, marinate for beef I've tried.

This was my first experience with fish sauce.  I opened the bottle and all I could think was this must be the nastiest smelling stuff ever made.  Don't let that put you off though, because the steak ends up really tasty.  I found the ginger and sesame to be the dominate flavors in the steak, but I did every so often get a hint of the fish sauce.  I think it is something everyone should try for themselves at least once, but if you are not an adventurous person, this is not the recipe for you.

I didn't have the sesame oil, so I used olive oil.  It was absolutely perfect.  My husband was very impressed (he thought he was the only one that could make a good marinade).

It was a dream come true!

I sliced the 2 pound slab of steak into 6 individual steaks. I used a gallon size freezer bag to marinade it in rather than a dish.  I didnt have a bbq grill so I used my toaster oven to broil it (3 pieces at a time).  6 min on one side at 8 minutes on the other (it came out medium well).

Does not taste fishy at all.  The fish sauce is salty so dont add soy sauce or salt until u taste it first.  I used normal sesame oil.  It was delicous!  

"Score" means cut a diagonal slice into the steak.

Just made this again for the upteenth time!  I have never found another marinade this great.  Don't be put off by the fish sauce--it does not taste fishy.  It is an amazing taste!!

This honestly made the best steak that I have ever ever had in my life.  I could have eaten the whole two pounds by myself.  I highly recommend this...don't tweak anything!

I used a top sirloin cut to make this, and adjusted the recipe just a bit.  I added the juice of half a lime, and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  It gives it a slightly tangy taste, and gives it a Thai taste.  Very juicy!

OMG, this was sooooo good! The only change I made was the fish sauce, I just cut it down a bit. Having to much made it to "fish" for me.

I rated this only 4-stars NOT because I didn't like it, on the contrary.  I just thought the way it was written was a little ambiguous.  I wasn't sure what type of chili sauce to use.  I used Sriracha which is pretty darn hot.  This may have contributed to the overall saltiness of the finished product too, not sure.  Anyway, marinating the steak overnight (24 hours) produced a slightly too salty, slightly too spicy but overwhelmingly tasty steak!  Less marinating could reduce the saltiness and spicyness but I'm afraid it would be at the expense of it's tenderness.  As I'm quite happy with it the way it is I don't think I'll chance it :o)   Update:  I've found that adding 1/4 cup of Thai Sweet Chili Sauce to the marinade then marinating it for 24 hrs produces an excellent finished product.  It yields a steak that has a balance of spicy, sweet, and savoury that everyone loves.  Caution, my friends let marinate for 48 hours and it got allot hotter.

This was a great marinade.  I used porterhouse steaks from Australia and let them marinate for 48 hours - don't know if it was good steak or the marinade, but they were really tender even though my husband overcooked them a bit on the BBQ (few too many beers while cooking!).  The flavour was great too and our guests raved about the steaks.

We marinated the steak for 24 hours and tasted great...just a little salty.  It could have been the brand of fish sauce or chili sauce.  Next time I'll try marinating it for half a day and see if that may help. ***Update, we make this about every other week and might be one of my husband's favorite dishes.  What we do: I use Lee Kum Kee's Chili Garlic Sauce and Orchids Fish Sauce.  We marinade it for about 8 hours and tastes best over a charcoal grill.  It's a big hit with guests.  We won't cook a flanksteak any other way.

I was suprised at how sweet this tasted.  This is now one of my favorite marinades for a flank steak.  The crispy burnt edges are to die for.  Definatly try this recipe.

Amazing recipe !!! My  family simply adored it ...Initially I thought the fish sauce might be a bit too strong ...but all the smell dissipated with cooking.

This is such a good Marinade.  I have used it so many times and am finally getting around to writing this review. I have put the steaks in it overnight and for only an hour.  Either way it is good.  I use oyster sauce instead of fish sauce because I usually have that on hand in the pantry.  I like to serve it with fried rice and a veggie. Delish!

We used steak medallions and ground ginger.  Yum!!!  Marinated meat for a couple of days, and the flavors really permeated the meat.  One of the best marinades we've done in a while.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, especially with the fish sauce. However, this was one of the most tastey steak marinades. My family absolutely loved it. I marinated 3 flank steaks (6lbs) over night and it turned out perfect! There was nothing left to take home. Which is always a good sign for me! Also with the Chili Sauce,it's not really spicey hot...just a good spice to add.

Thought it would be more spicy with all that chile but it wasn't. Very good done medium rare after a 3.5 day marinade! I took the left over steak and sliced it thinly and they made a beautiful addition to an another asian meal I prepared.

I bought that really thinly sliced beef from an asian grocery store. While I could not walk away from the grill, this marinade is SO GOOD on this beef and made it so juicy. I bet it would be as good under the broiler or even in a sautee pan.

Absolutely incredible!I was skeptical like many regarding the fish sauce. Made it exact to recipe. Used Hunnan Chili Sauce. Was a bit spicy for the wife and my younger son, but they both went back for second and thirds anyway because of the flavor. Will probably try sweet chili sauce next time just to see if it is not quite so hot. I believe this is a new family favorite!

This was suprisingly good. I pan fried rather than grilled and it was very tasty, and so easy. I only had about a pound of steak but marinated in the whole marinade recipe - turned out great. Thanks!

Flavor was good but WAY too salty!  Definitely water it down.  I would try again if I could water the sauce down and get it right without ruining perfectly good meat. It was barely edible.

Very tasty, but got very smoky in the house while cooking it. Used my Emeril grill pan to do indoors since I made it in the winter time. Better to do on a warm day with the windows opened if cooking inside. :)

Awesome recipe.  I added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar to balance out the saltiness.  We also made skewers instead of just the beef.  Our skewers consisted of the marinated beef; red, yellow, and orange bell peppers; and sweet onions.  It was incredibly tasty!!!!!!

Fantastic. I didn't think it was too salty as written and I let it marinate over night. The meat was super tender. Prior to marinating, I cut the meat into strips about 1 inch wide. Then when it came time to cook the meat, I skewered it on wooden squewers and grilled it. They made great appitizers because you could hold one end of the squewer and eat off the other.

I tried this recipe for a Memorial Day party and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  When I was making the marinade I was a little worried about how it was going to taste because the fish sauce is so strong smelling but it wasn't fishy at all.  Also, if you are worried about it being too spicy because of the chili sauce don't be, once it is cooked it isn't spicy at all.  Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper.

The recipe was decent and reminds me of a similar Thai chicken recipe. I felt as though the flavors didn't compliment the beefs as well, however. I think that more chili sauce (even sambal oelek) and a higher grade of beef would help possibly. Also, if the beef were precut, then marinated, and quickly seared via a very hot wok that might help distribute the flavor more too.

I think the key ingredient here is what kind of chili sauce one uses. I used a plain bottle that simply said, "Chili Sauce" and it didn't come out spectacular. Next time I will use an Asian chili sauce with more kick. Still delicious though!

I use oyster sauce and a mild asian chilli sauce. I have used it on flank steak and chicken wings and thighs. Everyone seems to like it a lot. Some have even raved about it. I do enjoy it, but sometimes the sesame oil flavor seems a little bit overpowering.

Maybe its not fair of me to rate this spicy dish since I can hardly handle mild salsa, but no one said much about it at my dinner party like they did about the other dish I served.

Very good not too salty,made as stated except all I had was canola oil and ground ginger(which I scaled to the fresh). I didn't even marinate it for 3 hrs (more like 2 2/3).Also I only had london broil steak on hand, still good!

I used a london broil and it worked well.I marinated over night to get the best flavor.
I only had hot chili sauce so it was a little spicy but everyone really liked it.Don't let the fish sauce scare you....
It is in alot of asian dishes and you don't even know it.

I thought this was terrific and the hubby loved it as well. I thought it might be too spicy...but, not at all. It was a wee-bit fishy and salty from the fish sauce. Next time, I think I will use half the amount of fish sauce it calls for and replace the other half with low sodium soy sauce. I loved this and I'll be making it again! Thanks!

Yummy!  I admit, I never use fish sauce... I always substitute for soy sauce.  One note, I sliced my flank steak into strips and skewered them... which made them absorb more marinade and they were a bit too spicy--but I'm sure if I had left them as whole steaks, it would have been just right.  Next time I slice and skewer them I think I will back off the chili sauce a bit.

I am pretty bummed about how these came out but i think it was my own doing. (hence the 4 stars)My steaks ended up way to salty. It could have been because i marinaded way to long (aprox.24+ hrs) or because of the chili sauce i used. Recipe didnt specify what kind of chili sauce. I have both sweet chili sauce and reg. chili sauce(kind of salty/spicy)which is the one i ended up using. I followed the recipe to a T. I will attempt these again because i like the ingredients in this recipe.Next time i will only marinade 6 hours or so and possibly use sweet chili sauce.

Made this yesterday, since my mother-in-law loves fish sauce and it was pretty much successful. I made her taste it first w/out telling her about the sause & she ABSOLUTELY loved it! The only thing i might suggest is to probably put a litte less of the recommend on the fish and chili sauce because it was a bit on the salty side but other than that it was good. Will do again! Thanx!

Alrighty, I've made this numerous times. With the fish sauce and without (using oyster) and it's absolutely fantastic.
We've used it on steak.. YUM.. and pork steaks.. double yum!
I'm using it right now on a whole chicken and I can't wait to see how it turns out!

I do think I like this with oyster sauce better though. It's alot thicker so coats meat better. Plus fish sauce smell tends to linger and no amount of scrubbing your hands can get rid of the smell :P hehe

This "Asian Barbequed Steak" was quite good. I normally would have marinated the steak overnight; however, after noting that other reviewers commented that this made the steak much saltier and much hotter, I marinated it only 3 hours. It was delicious. I made mine with Sweet Thai Chili sauce. My husband was surprised that I could eat the steak since I don't generally like spicy foods, but I didn't find it intolerably spicy. I also made a side salad with a homemade toasted sesame-oil vinaigrette to go with the steak.

Fantastic flavour!  Used 3 bs stewing beef, 1/3 cup flour, 1 1/2  cans beef broth, 1 beef bouillon cube. Good, thick gravy first day but broth disappeared  2nd day. Veggies held together both days. Good 2 meals.

*Next time 3lbs meat, 1/3 C flour, 1 beef bouillon  cube and 2 cans beef broth. Only cook 8 hours.

Very good. The fish sauce in it doesn't taste "fishy" at all. Be careful if you cook it in a frying pan because it will stick to the pan and be a mess to clean up.

Flank steak was not available so I used skirt steak. Marinated it overnight and grilled the next day. I found it to be very flavorful. I was concerned about it being too hot because of the amount of chilli sauce but it was just fine. It is slightly salty due to the fish sauce but not too bad.I don't like a lot of salt and it was alright for even me. Served it with coconut-cilantro jasmine rice.

I don't know what to say about this.  Every other bite I alternated from saying "this is awesome" to "this is pretty salty". But I ate the whole thing. And really liked it.  It's the good kind of salty. I don't think I can serve his for company yet but I   will revisit it.  I set it in the marinade at 10am and ate it at 8pm so maybe I need to stick to the directions and only marinade it for 3 hours. Or reduce the fish sauce?  Regardless, it was very good......but just good enough for family the way I did it the first time. But very good. Confused yet?

this is now 1 of my 2 top steak marinades that i use!  my 4 year old likes steak just fine, but she licked up half of steak with this marinade!  very very good!  i didnt use fresh ginger root - just used ground and added what i thought looked good (about 1 tsp.).  fish sauce about made me sick smelling it, but the result is marvelous.  marinaded it the night before and served it the following evening!  yum yum yum!

This was delicious. However, due to reasons of convenience (and laziness), I changed a few ingredients - soy sauce instead of fish sauce, tabasco instead of chili sauce, and olive oil instead of sesame oil. It still turned out very tasty! So easy too. Flank steak has always been my favorite, and this just makes it better. Will certainly make again.

This is a great marinade.  I served this with stir fry vegetables & rice noodles  but this steak would also work well sliced thinly and served in an asian style salad.  I'm really glad I tried the recipe - I'll definately use it again.

When I first made this marinade, I was a little worried about how it would taste because of the disgusting smell of the fish sauce, but everything turned out great.  The flank steak was was very tender and juicy, and the chili sauce gave it a little kick but it wasn't so spicy that it burned my mouth.

WOW!!!! This is now my favorite recipe on this site. I made it exactly as written but only had time to marinade it for two hours. It was simply amazing. I made some extra sauce and coated green beens in the frying pan before serving. Delicious meal and crazy easy to prepare.

i made it just as the recipe said. it was sooooo salty and extremely hot. i'm glad i tasted it first. i had to put brown sugar, orange juice, lemon grass, and extra sesame oil and ginger. i just kept working with it until it became palatable.  my finished product i liked, but i would never use this again

Marinated my steaks for about 15 hours. It is salty, but oh so good! I'll  wipe the marinade off of the steaks before I cook them next time to see if that reduces the salty taste. I used Sriracha chili sauce.  Unexpected bonus: This marinade tenderized the inexpensive chuck steaks  I used for this.
6/26/2017 - I made this again using cube steaks. Still pretty salty, but I LOVE this marinade.

This is a great marinade! The first time I used this recipe, I used it on pork tenderloin, and it was fabulous! I used it again on beef steak, with a few added ingredients according to my taste. I added about 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of Chinese 5-spice powder. I also fried the marinated steak in peanut oil, which turned out to be a positive addition.

I'm not sure this would be a good marinade if you cooked the meat any other way than grilling.  Grilling this meat on skewers with broccoli was awesome!
