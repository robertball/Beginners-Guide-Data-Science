I make a recipe very similar to this.  I do not use lettuce (as it tends to wilt as it sits out) and I don't use green pepper.  Even though I love green pepper, I don't feel it belongs in this recipe (just my opinion). I make homemade guacamole and put that layer on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer.  I found a good guac recipe on this site (LuvAnn's Guacamole) that I use.  They always "lick the platter clean" every single time.  I've NEVER had leftovers.  I serve with Tostitos Scoops as they grab the dip more!  Oh and this doesnt' totally spread to fit in a 13x9 pan (mostly the beans don't) so I bought a clear pyrex dish a slightly smaller size.  This dish has pretty much become my 7-layer dip dish because it's requested so much at every party!  This is an awesome crowd pleaser.

Great recipe, thank you.  One word of advice on the container you put it in, an 11 x 7 is no where near large enough.  I ended up leaving out the lettuce, not that any one cared!  I will use my 9 x 13 next time, I think that will be the perfect size.  Thanks again.

This recipe is very good as is, but is also easy to alter to personal taste.  I have took suggestions of others and added 1 lb. of hamburger to the taco seasoning and guacamole instead of lettuce, both very good. I however like this recipe best with medium taco seasoning and salsa and also adding a can of Rotel instead of the tomato, green pepper, onions.  Very easy and adds a bit of a kick to it. The 13X9in. dish works the best.

Great dip.  I started off with the beans for layer one.
The cream cheese , sour cream, and half of taco seasoning mix(makes it very spicy)mixed together for layer two.
I added guacamole for layer three.
Diced tomatoes for layer four.
Black olives for layer five.
Salsa for layer six and
lots of shredded cheese for layer seven.
I skipped onions, lettuce, and peppers and spread my layers in a 13x9 inch glass dish and heated at 350 for 30 minutes and talk about people raving.
Everyone wanted to know the recipe.
Easy, delicious and def a keeper for a fun appetizer

Just wonderful!

I actually used a hybrid of user advice here and ended up with this layer combination (from bottom up): Layer 1-refried beans
Layer 2-Cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning
Layer 3-Guacamole
Layer 4-Tomatoes, green peppers, green onions, and lettuce
Layer 5-Salsa
Layer 6-Shredded Cheddar cheese
Layer 7-Black beans

I really liked this combination of ingredients and didn't find the lettuce or any of the other vegetables to be bothersome.

I didn't know whether I would prefer this dish hot or cold, so I served it warm the first night, and we had the leftovers cold.  I love it either way, and plan to make it again, both for my own family and for get-togethers, for which it is perfect in terms of size.

I'm a big fan of taco dip, so I LOVED this recipe.  I've made it many times and everyone always loves it.  I think it's way better without meat in it.  I find that I can't have it in the refrigerator, because if I do I'll eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  My only suggestion would be to definitely get the thick and chunky salsa, and drain it a bit; otherwise it gets a little runny.  Thanks for the recipe!

Any time you combine these ingredients, you are going to get something pretty tasty. But I think this particular recipe has some issues. For instance, why mix cream cheese in with the sour cream? To me, that doesn't seem to add a lot, and it throws the proportions off (too much dairy). I'd rather mix the taco seasonings into the sour cream and forget the cream cheese. Why put the cheddar cheese at the very top instead of on the (presumably hot) refried beans, where it will get a little gooey? And if you're going to add multiple layers that look alike (e.g. diced tomatoes & salsa, or green pepper/green onions/lettuce), why put them together so they only look like one layer? There are better ways to order the layers.

If you make this and put lettuce in it, be sure to chop the lettuce very, very finely; otherwise you can't dip through the lettuce layer with any normal chip.

I'd suggest finding another layer dip, or making modifications to this one. I wouldn't make it again as-is. It's not bad, but given that there are so many great recipes for layer dips out there, I wouldn't settle for one that's just "not bad."

I drastically reduced the fat and calories by substituting fat-free sour cream, fat-free cream cheese, and reduced fat cheddar. Brought it to a party and NO ONE noticed the change, because all the other flavors made up for it. The dip was scarfed up, and I got requests for the recipe.

This dip is wonderful!  I have even altered it a little bit by adding a layer of hamburger meat mixed with the taco seasoning mix.  That is wonderful as well.  My husband and I love it and it is good and easy for like Saturday nights when we just want something small but so good!

This is so good!  The cream cheese really adds something to the sour cream layer.  I took this to a function and it was all eaten--people went back for more!  I don't think it really makes 56 servings; I would guess more like 25 or so.

This is very good! I realized I was out of taco seasoning but found a "homemade" version from this site (submitted by Bill Echols) and used that instead.  I omitted the salsa, so I guess my dip only had six layers but great just the same! I also used refried beans with green chilies.  Thank you sue!

My experience with making this dip was that the salsa caused it to get a bit watery and break down the sour cream/cream cheese layer, and the lettuce wilted and became a bit soggy.  Tasted great and guests gobbled it up regardless, but didn't look terribly appealing (I overheard a lot of "what is this?"  and "it's good, just a little messy-looking")...  I solved this problem by combining taco seasoning, refried beans, and salsa for the first layer.  This also ended up bulking up the bean layer, which I thought was a bit thin the first time I made it.  For the sour cream/cream cheese layer, I now substitute sour cream with green onion dip.  Adds a little something extra, I think.  I made guacamole to top the sour cream layer, then topped with chopped tomato (omitted bell peppers, green onions, and lettuce), finely shredded cheddar and sliced black olives.  I will definitely make it this way from now on!  It held together beautifully and the flavors and textures were perfect!

I noticed that a few people commented that they didn't care for the lettuce cause it wilts... try shredded cabbage instead... it's more authentic for mexican style food and it holds up better.  It also provides much more nutritional value as well as more flavor and crunch!  I hardly ever use lettuce in my mexi recipes now!

I took this dip recipe and modified it a bit after reading some of the other reviews, but it really is fantastic and a great hit when I brought it to a Super Bowl party.

I took out the tomato, green pepper, green onions, and olives, and added in guacamole, jalapenos and salsa (it had to be chunky, otherwise the dip will be runny). I layered it in this order (from the bottom up): (1) - Refried beans with the taco seasoning, (2) - Cream cheese and sour cream, (3) - Guacamole, (4) - Lettuce, (5) - Salsa, (6) - Cheddar cheese, (7) - Diced jalapenos. After that, I heated it up, covered, for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. It was absolutely phenomenal.

I made this for a party recently and was told that it was the best 7 layer dip ever!  I did take note of the reviewers who said it tended to be on the watery side, so I picked a chunky style salsa and strained it, and also seeded the tomato. In addition, just for personal preference, I added some of the taco seasoning to the sour cream and cream cheese mix, left out the green pepper and the lettuce, and used black refried beans.  Not watery at all and quite delicious.  Thanks for the great dip, will definitely make this one for a party again.

Great recipe!  My ex used to make something similar (have her rec. here somewhere,) hers called for hamburger/taco seasoning layer, no lettuce, but otherwise similar, with one distict difference... serve it hot!  Heat to melt the cheddar, you'll get rave reviews!  I have found that it works well in a "standard" electric skillet, heat through, turn down to warm, and watch if vanish!!

Last week I tried this recipe the first time and it was fantastic. Beans, sour cream, Avocado and  tomatoes make no seven layers but thats the way it appeared very yummy to me. I ate it all by myself within two days. I mixed the avocado with canned pizza tomatoes which I drained first. The avocado didn't turn brown that way, since tomato has some acid. I made fresh tacos to go with the dip and enjoyed the rest with nacho chips. 
Perfect! It's in my recipe box and on my menu plan for the future.

This will definitely be one of my go-to party dishes in the future! I made it last Saturday for our Independence Weekend party and it was completely devoured. Multiple people seriously just hung out by the dip so they could eat to their hearts' content. It was really delicious! I used this recipe as a template, but like other reviewers, made some personal changes to fit our tastes. For the first layer, I used 2 cans of fat free refried beans (1 can was just not enough, and nobody seemed to notice a taste difference with the ff beans) mixed with one packet of taco seasoning. The second layer was the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. The third layer was a jar of thick n' chunky salsa and the fourth layer was the chopped tomato and green onion (I omitted the green pepper). For the fifth layer, I used guacamole (I live in So Cal and this is a necessity for us) and I covered the guac in shredded cheddar cheese. So, technically, ours was a 6 layer dip but I think it was just perfect this way. Not only was it devoured, but people were also commenting on how good it was and making jokes about how much of it they ate. It is quite possibly one of the easiest dips to make and I can guarantee your guests will not be disappointed. Yum!

Family loved this. made this for dinner one evening. The only thing i did differently was i used 1/2 the pkg of taco seasoning in the sour cream mixture. I cooked 1/2 pound ground beef with the other half of taco seasoning then added the refried beans to the meat mixture. Bottom meat and bean layer is warm then you layer with the other ingredients as noted. Came out very good. Going to make this again for Super Bowl Sunday :D

This was an overall great recipe.  I made a few slight changes.  For one, I mixed a package of taco seasoning with 1 pound of ground beef.  Then I layered like this: 1. Refried beans 2. shredded cheese 3. sour cream/cream cheese 4. ground beef 5. salsa 6. tomatoes 7. olives 8. shredded cheese.  Then I baked it at 350 until everything was warm and the cheese was melted.  After I took it out of the oven I added shredded lettuce.

I agree you either need a 9X13 or maybe two smaller dishes is an even better idea so you can keep one fresh and replace it as needed? I also left out the lettuce simply as I didn’t want it to go soggy after a while. Best TIP… the refried beans mix tends to be too thick and any chips will likely break trying to scoop it up. I take about 2-3 table spoons of the salsa and mix it in with the bean/taco mix. When you do this it will be easier to scoop. I also let the cream cheese warm up a bit to room temperature to make it easier to mix and spread. It is a party hit though…

Tasted awesome and got a lot of compliments from people at two different parties.  I heated the refried beans and added the seasoning so it was easier to spread, didn't use lettuce or green peppers, didn't use all the sour cream mixture, added a layer of guacamole, and I split the recipe between two shallow serving trays.  Everyone liked the thin layers because you got a taste of everything in one scoop.    It is exactly one year later from my original review and this recipe is still being requested at every bbq/party/gathering of any sort that I go to.  There are never any leftovers and people I've never met will find me to tell me how much they've enjoyed it.  Thank you for this recipe!

Do not change a thing about this recipe.  Make sure that you use a dish because this thing is way too heavy for one of those throw away foil things.  This is one of the best taco dip recipes I have had.  Amazing...thanks.

This dip is the best! I get more compliments on it and never have leftovers. I think the secret is in adding taco seasoning to the beans, although I usually use two cans of beans since one packet of seasoning to one can of beans can be too salty. The cream cheese/sour cream mixture is too die for! A few more tips: Guacamole makes this even better (to save time, I usually use vacuum-sealed guacamole found in the produce section--it tastes really fresh and almost as good as homemade). I also skip the lettuce and green peppers.

This was AMAZING. Due to my location we don't have refried beans, so I used 1 14 oz. can of black beans. It worked just fine. I found that what the recipe called for was a bit too much in terms of the cream cheese/sour cream, so I used about 2/3rds. We also used a lot more veggies. Still absolutely amazing, I will make it again or try to adapt it into a salad!

I made this recipe for the first time for a party.  I didn't realize just how huge this platter of dip turns out to be!!!  It's great!  Everyone loved it and there was certainly enough to go around!  I added Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta Ranch seasoning packet to the sour cream!! It was excellent.

A few years ago, I was asked to bring taco dip (which I had never made) to a family gathering for something different... now I'm asked to bring it every time!! My version (which has been tweaked over the years): layer 1- refried beans; layer 2- sour cream, cream cheese, taco seasoning combined; layer 3- guacamole (sometimes from scratch, but often pre-made for time's sake); layer 4- chunky salsa (slightly drained); layer 5- lettuce (finely chopped) and scallions (or chopped onion, depending on my mood); layer 6- shredded cheddar cheese (or a hybrid of sharp cheeses); layer 7- chopped black olives... serve cold. It's always a hit!

I just have to say that this taco dip recieved RAVE reviews at my sisters' moving party.  I used taco sauce instead of the salsa (I thought, tomatoes on top of tomateos?).  YUM!  Next time I will use Hidden Valley Ranch "Fiesta Ranch" dip and mix 1/2 with the beans & 1/2 with the sour cream mixture instead of taco seasoning (I have another recipe using it and it is really good).  Good dip, the guys ate this instead of moving boxes, HA!  Thanks Sue.  Peace all, ;)

I agree with other reviewers about leaving out the lettuce and green pepper but I always have made this using regular refried beans WITHOUT the taco spice and also using sour cream WITHOUT the cream cheese which is MUCH better.  REASON:  The cream cheese absolutely covers up all flavor from the beans, the cheese, the sauce and the sour cream!  UGH!  It is so heavy and bland and just coats everything with ZERO taste! :(  Why ruin all the spicy flavors!  Then you don't need to add the fake taste you get with the taco spice.  Leave out the cream cheese and it's a winner!

I make this recipe often with a few alterations.  As a "secret ingredient" I add cubed Velveeta (~1/2 lb) to the refried beans (and I've had people tell me they love this dip even though they usually don't like refried beans), heat in small pan until melted and just add 1/2 of the envelope of taco seasoning mix and a little of the salsa.  When the velveeta is melted I spread the mixture in a large pie plate and refrigerate it.  Then I mix the room temperature cream cheese with a hand mixer until smooth, then add the sour cream and the other half of the taco seasoning mix...this is how to prevent the lumps.  I never add green pepper or olives and sometimes skip the lettuce too.  This dip always disappears!

looove this recipe!!  it's really easy and always makes me look good when i bring it to parties.  i've made it countless times, and you can really adapt it easily to your taste.  i've done all lower fat ingredients and i think there is minimal difference in flavor.  i also prefer taco sauce to salsa, and we tend to add jalapenos.  very very good appetizer recipe, thank you!

I made this dish for fathers day. We made a twist with our traditional dinner this year and had a mexican theme dinner. This dip was gone in a FLASH. I changed the recipe a little. I added gaucmole and instead of tomotoes and onions I added a can of Rotele Tomatoes(drained). It was a little spicy but added alot of flavor. I also mixed the taco seasonings 1/2 with the beans and 1/2 with the sour cream mixture. I served the dip with the large scoop frito's. They didn't break and the guest were able to get each layer of the dip. GREAT DIP!!!!! :)

It's true when someone brings this dip to a party it's always a hit. So I really wanted to know how to make it. It was super good and everyone loved it, but I'm going to half the sour cream creme cheese next time. Hubby doesn't like anything called "sour" Putting seasoning in the beans is genius!

I agree with other reviewers that increasing the bean portion by half or more is probably a good idea. I added a guac layer between the beans and sour cream and omitted the green peppers, lettuce, and salsa (the last two because I was afraid of wilting/mushiness). I also mixed the taco seasoning with the sour cream mixture, but next time I would use only half a packet of seasoning.

I made this for a party last weekend and everyone raved about it! I made it on two platters so that it would be thinner and easier to dip. I was a little skeptical about the green onions and green peppers thinking they'd overpower the dish, but it all tasted fantastic. I also added a layer of guacamole. This is now my new party recipe! Thanks so much for sharing.

This is really good but it makes A LOT!  I used my regular-sized serving platter and it was oozing over the sides.  I should have used my over-sized turkey platter.  Will do that next time I make this.

I make almost the same thing, but I add the sour cream and the taco seasoning together and sit over night if possible.  I layer, refried beans, sour cream/taco seasoning mixture, guacamole over the top of that, shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes and sliced black olives.  Great!!!  Make homemade taco chips to go with it! Yum!

GREAT GREAT GREAT!  I made this for New Years Eve. And it was gone in no time.  The only thing I did a little different is that I doubled the amount of refried beans. And thats only because of bought a 30 ounce can of refried bean instead of 16oz.  But it seamed to be just the right amount anyway.

Delicious with slight modifications. I doubled the recipe. So I mixed 2 cans of refried beans with one taco seasoning overnight and 1/2 of a serving of Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols--it didn't make a difference. I put the remaining Taco Seasoning I in the sour cream/cream cheese mixture and let it sit overnight. Also used 2 jars of thick and chunky salsa and draining overnight eliminated two cups of water from the salsa. Layer 1-beans, layer 2-cream cheese, sour cream w/taco seasoning, layer 3-tomatoes, layer 4-green onions, layer 5-gucamole, layer 6-drained thick and chunky salsa, layer 7-cheese, layer 8-black olives. It keeps well in the fridge for at least a week. Next time I will put the taco seasoning in the sour cream mixture not the beans. I have also made it with Rotel vs. salsa which works well and is cheaper.

This dip was fantastic!  I did make a couple of changes, though.  First, I mixed a pound of ground beef with the refried beans (I cooked the hamburger in about 3/4 of the taco seasoning).  Secondly, I added 1/4 of the taco seasoning to the sour cream/cream cheese layer for a little extra taste.  Third, I used half cheddar cheese and half taco cheese for some extra Mexican flavoring.  Finally, I didn't use lettuce after reading some of the reviews, but I'm sure that had no affect on the taste.  I will absolutely make this again!

I made this recipe a combination of the 7-layer dip I usually make and this recipe.  Layered as such:  refried beans, mashed avacado, the cream cheese-sour cream combination, taco seasoning, salsa, diced fresh tomatoes, sliced green onions, sliced pickled peppers, black olives, and shredded cheese.  My family said it was the best I'd ever made, so guess it was a good combination.  Will probably make it this way from now on.  Thanks for the suggestions in your recipe.

Make sure u drain the salsa first or it will be swimming in juice at the bottom of the dish.  Thanks for recipe...it's not bad and easy to tailor to what we like.

This is fabulous! I made it last year for super bowl (with some alterations for preference) and it was devoured! I was asked to make it again this year, and again, completely devoured! This is a keeper for sure. Here's what I did differently; I cooked 1 lb ground beef with taco seasoning, and mixed with the refried beans, left out most of the veggies, and layered as follows (from bottom to top):

1) Ground beef/refried bean mixture
2) Sour cream/cream cheese mixture
3) Chunky Salsa
4) Shredded Cheese
5) Olives

Last year I served it cold and this year I served it warm (baked at 375 for about 20 min) and it tastes delicious both ways! Wonderful recipe! Can't say enough good things about this!

This a great dip recipe to which I made some changes to due to personal preference and some of the other reviewers tips.  So many other reviewers said they did not have enough bean dip to cover the bottom of the pan called for in the recipe and some actually bought a smaller sized glass dish. Instead, I bought an extra can of bean dip, and that problem was solved.  Also, I do not add the taco seasoning to the bean dip.  I add it to the sour cream and cream cheese mixture because I think the flavors blend nicely together in the dip, rather than getting it in one kind of raw, spicy tasting scoop of the beam dip.  I also used 16 ounces of fresh salsa and added a layer of homemade guacamole.  I also skip the green pepper and shredded lettuce.  I received a lot of compliments on this dish and it was devoured!

Brought this to a potluck and got rave reviews! A few people said it was the best 7 Layer Dip they had had and asked for the recipe. I did the following layers: 1. beans/taco seasoning, 2. cream cheese/sour cream, 3. guacamole, 4. medium chunky salsa, 5. lettuce/green peppers/tomatoe/green onions, 6. cheese, 7. olives.

I've made this dip many times since first finding it two years ago. It's always a hit. After making it so many times, I have modified it a little bit. I mix the cream cheese, sour cream, and taco seasoning together. I add a can of diced green chilis to the refried beans. I skip the lettuce because it gets soggy and add a layer of guacamole. I also put the tomatoes on top because I have a couple friends who prefer to eat around them. Love this recipe, thank you so much!

I've used this recipe many times, and once again last night, somebody asked me for the recipe.  So I just had to add my comments here too.  This recipe is a winner - it never fails to generate at least one request for the recipe.  My version is fairly different though.  I use black beans instead of refried beans.  I don't use lettuce or tomato, but sometimes use canned corn, or avocado slices or even guacamole.  I also put the black olives under the cheese, as I prefer the appearance of the heap of cheddar, rather than of the black olives.  But it's always well-loved.  Thanks for this recipe!

Was very good, everyone loved it and kept going back for more.  I added taco seasoning to the sour cream mixture,  I think that really added flavor to the dish.  Next time I will leave out the tomato because it didn't add anything to the dish.  I also replaced the green pepper with a chopped jalapeno.

I made this dish for a party at work.  I have never had a seven layer salad before so I had no idea how it was suppose to taste.  The changes I made based on the other reviewers--I added 1 pound of ground beef as the second layer (after the beans), I added 1/2 pack of taco seasonings to the sour cream, use thick and chunky salsa and I left out the lettuce.  The party started at 11:00.  I went to get food at 11:15 and the salad was already half gone and one co-worker was just hanging out by the bowl. By 11:45 there was nothing left.  Everyone raved on how great this was!! Great recipe.

i absolutely LOVE this recipe and as a lot of other reviewers did i made a few variations.. i skipped the lettuce, as i really dont think it adds much to the taste, its more of a 'filler' imo. i made this for a superbowl party and it was a HUGE hit! i will definitely make this again! i made this with 10 yummy layers 1) can of refried beans spread evenly 2) approximately a pound of cooked ground beef cooked with 1/2 pkt of taco seasoning 3) home-made chunky guacamole (thats to die for if i may say so myself) :) 4) sour cream mixed with the remaining 1/2 pkt of taco seasoning 5) shredded sharp cheddar cheese 6) 1 small can of mild green chiles (drained) 7) chunky salsa (drained) 8) sliced black olives 9) fresh tomatoes 10) green onions

This recipe deserves five stars because it's so quick, simple, and versatile.  I brought it to a party and everyone enjoyed it-- I didn't take home any leftovers. I cut the amount of sour cream/cream cheese in half and added some taco seasoning to it as well as the beans, used medium salsa and a can of Rotel drained for the veggie layers, and added chopped black olives under the cheese.  It took a few minutes to throw together and stick in the fridge (I did it a few hours before the party).  Will use it again when I need something quick to bring.  Thanks!

I wasn't crazy about the beans mixed with the taco seasoning.  It kind of overpowered everything.  I served this for a party, and for noshing the next day, and I still have more left.

This is a great recipe and very versatile, it can easily be changed to suit your taste.

Based on other reviews that said the beans were a little thing, I doubled the beans & taco seasoning layer.  

I also changed up the veggie layer, I just put green onions and black beans on top of the salsa, but that's just our household's personal taste.

Overall a really great base recipe.

This was delicious.  I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand & it really turned out great.  It was the first dish to go at the potluck.  I mixed with the refried beans a 16 oz can of Dennison's chili con carne w/beans (this added a lot of great flavor).  I added 3/4 pkg. of the taco seasoning & about 1/4 jar of taco sauce to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Left out the bell pepper & everything else stayed the same.  If I had avocadoes, I would have added a layer of guacamole ~ that's always a nice addition.

I wanted to make this for a party and decided to try the recipe out beforehand.  I'm glad because it was majorly salty and wouldn't serve this at my party without making some changes.  I won't be using the entire taco seasoning mix.  My mouth seriously was hurting with each bite.  However it looked great.

An easy and delicious crowd pleaser! I started off with the beans and taco seasoning for layer one. The cream cheese, sour cream, mixed together for layer two. I added guacamole for layer three. Salsa for layer four and shredded cheese for layer five. Finally, I added diced tomatoes and black olives on top. I skipped onions, lettuce, and peppers.

This recipe is great!! I have made it many times and it is a hit every time. Everyone loves it and it is always finished. A guaranteed crowd pleaser.

One thing I might suggest is to leave out the tomato - since you are using salsa, the extra tomato really isn't neccessary. Also, a whole head of chopped lettuce seems to be way too much for this recipe. Use your judgement.

This is an easy and quite yummy recipe. I used Frog Ranch medium salsa and canned diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion (drained). Turned out really well and less work. Also used a springform pan to hold all ingredients together and then released to form a nice presentation on a large serving platter. Surround with tortilla chips and watch it disappear!

Great recipe! I use a cookie sheet or a large piece of cardboard covered in foil to put all the goodies on! I also get large tortillas and spread them out on the sheet or board, overlapping them to within an inch or two from the edges. Spread all the ingredients and have a feast. When down just a little left on the tortillas, roll them up and slice into 2 inch pieces. I guarantee nothing will be left! Easy clean up, too!

This was a disaster!!!  I followed the recipe exact, but it was all watery and nasty at the bean layer.  I took this to my husband's families gathering and they all said it was good but I think they were just being nice!  I don't know what caused this water disaster, but one thing is for sure, I'm deleting this from my recipe box!

This was an big hit at a family gathering. I loved it too!  It was the first appetizer gone!  One thing that I did a little different was that I used a very little bit of jarred salsa and then made my own "pico de gayo" by mixing together tomatoes, red onion, & cliantro.  This seemed to make the dish seem fresh.

I made it for lunch on my husbands day off, and we both thought it was an OK recipe, but nothing too special.  I just don't care for this cold, so I warmed it up in the oven for about 15-20 mins, and it tasted a lot better.  I expected it would have been a lot better considering the other reviews.  I did take out the olives, and green onions, because we don't care much for them.  I will not be making this one again.

I changed a couple things to suit my own tastes: 1) I did not include bell pepper as its not an ingredient I typically think of when eating tacos 2) I did not add guac, however, I will in the future 3) I DID add taco meat; being a carnivore, I just HAD to. Although I made a few changes, this recipe is a great start to an awesome dip you can cater to your own personal tastes.

I have been making this for 2 years now for my fiancé's firehouse Christmas and New Year's parties. It is such a hit, it's usually one of the 1st dishes to disappear! My fiancé begged me to make it again this year and my mom now asked me to make it for Christmas! I will only make it for the holidays because I could easily eat the entire thing on my own. I personally think Tostidos Scoops are the best chip for this dip (less mess).

Its a really good recipe. I see that some people seem to think you heat the beans up before you spread them but you don't they are done coming straight out the can. this dip is either a cold dip or room temp dip. You can mix and match what veggies you want to use and even omit the cream cheese which I don't use. I do recommend draining the salsa your dip will become watery and look uninviting if you don't. This never lasts long when I make it.

I've been making this for years, except I use cumin and chili powder instead of the taco seasoning. . .but. . .really the same thing.  I've been reading reviews and people are commenting on serving dishes.  This is really pretty if you use a platter, round is best but oval like in the pic is okay too.  You leave and edge of each ingredient showing so that your guests can see what's in it, it also looks really pretty like that.  If you put the cheese on top of the beans instead of on top of the lettuce, the lettuce doesn't get weighed down as much.  Okay. . .now I want some 7 layer dip!

We've made this a couple times now - here's the changes I make. Start with the beans/seasoning mix, add sour cream mix, then added a guacamole layer. Topped that with fresh homemade pico (tomato/onion/cilantro/lime/salt) instead of salsa. Then shredded cheese, black olives and green onions on top. We don't use the lettuce or bell pepper out of personal preference. Great dip for potlucks or parties.

I got rave reviews with this!  The only thing I would do differently is to pop it in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese on top. Also, you do need to use a dish that's larger thanthe original recipe calls for.9X17 is what I used.

Took advice from others. Added guacamole and took out the lettuce. My picky family devoured it. Perfect for football parties,cookouts, or just for a snack!

Not as impressed as other reviewers.  Mine turned out a bit watery, and we didn't really like the combo of flavors.  I'll keep looking for a similar dip that does not contain cream cheese.

I knew when I was putting the salsa on that it would make it watery with too much liquid from the salsa, but decided to follow the recipe anyway because of the reviews. Next time I will find a recipe with a layer of guac instead of salsa!

This doesn't have lots of flavor but it is a good and easy appetizer.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving off the lettuce since others indicated it gets soggy.  I used a 9" x 13" pan, baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, and served it warm with Fritos "Scoop" corn chips.  However, my husband took it to work the next day and his coworkers thought it was good cold (room temp).  I think next time I make this, I will try adding just a bit of ground meat and maybe Rotel (drained) instead of regular diced tomatoes.  It is good as is but I think it needs more flavor and/or spice.

Great recipe - I do mine a little differently ... I mix the cream cheese with the taco seasoning for the first layer, then re-fried beans, guacamole, sour cream, chopped lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped tomatoes, sliced olives, diced jalapenos, and green onions. OK so maybe that is more than 7 layers. Disappears so fast!

Due to diet restrictions I made this with Fat Free Cream Cheese and Fat Free Sour Cream, as well as, reduced fat cheese. I served this in a small trifle bowl and it was beautiful. Layered as follows: bean mixture, cream cheese/sour cream mixture, Salsa, tomatoes, cheese, and lettuce. The rest of my family didn't know it was reduced fat until I told them. I used PACE Mild Salsa and even after trying to strain it it was still watery. I will try a thick and chunky salsa recipe the next time.

I actually use the same ingredients, but do it a little differently.  I add salsa to the refried beans so it's not as thick (otherwise chips tend to break).  Then I add the taco seasoning to the sour cream and do not use cream cheese.  Next I layer the other items as in recipe, omitting the salsa layer.  It seems to disappear in minutes when I serve it.

Layer this in a large pizza pan. Bean mixture, cream cheese/sour cream mixture,
salsa, lettuce, cheese, green onion, tomato, black olives. Looks fantastic and you can dip through all seven layers at once.

Unlike some others, I really like that this recipe uses shredded iceberg instead of a layer of guacamole.  The result is a slightly different twist by adding some crisp freshness in with the softer ingredients as oppose to just layers and layers of softness.  If you don't want your lettuce to go soft, keep the dip in the fridge prior to serving. And as long is it's served in a controlled environment, it will withstand several hours outside of the fridge.  I got RAVE reviews and will indeed be making it again.

This is the best 7 layer dip ever... period. The only changes I made were to add a little bit of the taco seasoning to the cream cheese mix (and I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe off of this site... so good), I used 8 oz. Safeway brand Southwest Salsa, 8 oz Safeway brand Peach-Pineapple Salsa, added a can of corn, and instead of cheddar I used a Mexican Monteray Jack and Cheddar blend. I will never use another 7 layer dip recipe. This is IT! I used Tostitos to scoop it all up. My only recommendation is to the smash the cream cheese and sour cream with a fork to get an even consistancy. This dish is awesome! I tried to make it into burritos the next day, but after heating them up in the microwave, they turned out runny (yet still good). After day 2 the dip is just as amazing as day 1, if not more so. I even took a spoon to this! You don't need chips, just a spoon, it's so good! I can't say enough about this one... definitely a keeper!

I need 10 stars for this one!  My guests LOVED this recipe and I had to share it with everyone before they left.  

I made minor changes.  I heated each layer before serving cause I like it served warm and I used ground meat instead of beans. 

So, I mixed the meat and some cheddar in a bowl and heated it to melt the cheese.  Then I mixed the sour cream and cream cheese and put it on top of the meat. Finally I mixed salsa with more cheedar and heated it then placed it on top of the sour cream.  Then I just added all the toppings.  It looks and tastes awesome!  Make sure you use a big serving dish (deep too).

This was a fantastic recipe! I literally had to refill the chips all night. I had people ask for the recipe.
It was very easy to make. We used fresh salsa packaged by a local company in Michigan called "Garden Fresh Salsa," so it turns out a little runny on that layer. We also used their brand of chips. Yummy!

Brought this to a Super Bowl party. I added a layer of shredded chicken and used blue runner red kidney beans instead of the refried beans (I don't really like refried beans). Also left out the black olives, green peppers and green onions (I added finely diced onions to the guacamole) and added a layer of  homemade guacamole. I did use shredded green leaf lettuce. It was very delicious but the salsa did cause it to get runny after a few hours. I should have followed the others advice and drained the salsa. I will make again with a few variations, but overall it was very tasty!

Super simple to assemble in short amount of time. Made healthier with a few substitutions: lower-fat cream cheese and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream; homemade salsa; added some red onion to green onion and  1 cup cheese variety (some cheddar, pepper jack, etc). Delicious and a hit at our party! :)

Very nice recipe, I took in part the suggestions of Janet Dufor and JULIEWNEK (thanks to both!) and added my own twist, substituting lettuce (for the sogginess issue) and green bell pepper (my son does not like them) with a simple guacamole, which I made just mashing 5-6 avodacos, adding chili powder and cumin to taste, the juice of a lime (can use 1/2 too) and about 4-6 oz of creamy goat cheese. I used ~ 1lb. of 85% lean ground turkey for the taco meat, also spiced up with the taco seasoning mix (but added chili powder and cumin to taste to this too because the mix I had was a bit wimpy). I also warmed up the refried beans before spreading them (added a bit of water to it to make is a bit creamier, o/w too guey straight out of the can, can use chicken stock too). I had a large platter (and a nice size group!), so I decided to double the beans (2 cans). I also used light sour cream and no cream cheese to cut a bit on calories. I ended up with eight layers, which I arranged as follows (from bottom to top): 1) Refried beans; 2) Turkey taco meat; 3) Shredded Cheddar cheese (melted nicely on top the two warm layers); 4) Sour cream; 5) Salsa; 6) My guacamole; 7) Rotel original recipe tomatoes mixed with chives instead of green onions (either OK I think); 8) Sliced black olives. Great with either tortilla chips of all sorts or even soft corn tortillas (we used a lot of the latter and blue corn chips for some gluten-intolerant people). Everyone loved it!

Adding a good Guacamole does add another layer of flavors to this already delicious recipe. I did substitute sprouts for the lettuce and my friends loved it. (Note) If you want it a little spicier, try adding a hot Taco seasoning in place of the mild.

I have been making this for years but don't use lettuce or green pepper but add a layer of guacamole on the beans followed by sour cream, diced tomatoes, green onions, shredded cheese and olives.  I love how it can be changed to adapt to any taste!

this was a great recipe, similar to one my mother-in-law makes. it was raved about at several gatherings i have taken this to. but the second time around, along with following occasions, i did make some modifications (which is why i give this 4.5 out of 5 stars). i don't think the green bell peppers fit at all. green chiles or jalapenos might be a nice substitute, but i went without. i also opted to mix the taco seasoning in with the cream cheese & sour cream- that was more flavorful than mixing it with the beans. also added a layer of guacamole on top before the salsa. 1 small head of lettuce was overkill, didn't feel like it was necessary to complete the dish after the first round making it. omitting it made no difference to anyone and the dish was still gone each time it was served. but a great dip, super easy and i would highly recommend it.

Made the recipe exact and I think it didn't have enough beans and had too much sour cream/ cream cheese.

I add jalapenos (2-3) to the green pepper (make sure they are not wet) and omit the black olives . I also use hot salsa and "spicy" (lol) taco seasoning and "spicy" re-fried beans if I can find them(if not, I use fat free). I would recommend seeding the tomato before chopping it and use "reduced fat" cream cheese (fat free is a MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). I LOVE this dip though. It's basic, but really tasty. I eat it with tortilla, carrots, or tortilla chips. Additionally, I like a sharp cheese (nothing too milky/bland). Finally...it does get watery after the first day, so presentation may be a concern...If you don't mind, just drain off the salsa/lettuce water :)

Very good. We left out the lettuce and green pepper. Put refried beans on the bottom, for the next layer we combined sour cream, cream cheese and taco seasoning per others suggestions. I also put the salsa in a strainer for a few minutes before adding to the dip, which helped to keep the dip from getting watery as it sat.

Can you really go wrong with serving this? I have never had a complaint about this, unless it was to say there wasn't enough of it! I leave the veggies off until right before it's time to serve. I sometimes leave out the bell pepper and prefer it that way.

I used this recipe as an inspiration because I'd never mixed cream cheese with the sour cream layer in my version of this dip before; the idea intrigued me but I added a can of chopped jalapeno chilis to it for added punch.   I mixed a can of seasoned chili beans, lightly mashed, with the refiried beans because I didn't think ther was enough of the bean layer compared to the sour cream layer.  It loosened the refrieds and add flavor (I didn't have taco seasoning, as well).  I also added a layer of guacamole to this dip.  I really liked the addition of the cream cheese to the sour cream.  Thanks for this!

I use a low sodium taco seasoning mix and add it to the cream cheese/sour cream instead of the beans.  I also buy vegetarian refried beans.  Omit the green bell pepper and black olives...since I can't digest the bell pepper and neither my husband or I like olives.  Use a 5x7 pyrex dish.   Turns out great and I come home with a clean dish every time!!

This recipe is great.  However, I use enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I have salsa too,  if any one wants to put it on top.  I always have it for New Years Eve.  I also leave off the lettuce as it wilts and chop up fresh tomatoes on the side to add because it will get watery if not all is eaten.  I find it is better the next day.. if there is any left over.

Love, Love, Love this dip. I too mix one can of refried beans w/one can of frito lay bean dip. I aslo mix the taco seasoning to the creamcheese/sourcream mixture. I use thick &  chunky salsa (never watery). Lettuce just doesn't seem to fit. Seed the tomato, olives, green onions & monterey jack & cheddar on top...YUMMY...we never have leftovers.....Mahalo Sue.

THE BEST 7 layer taco dip I have ever had.  I always make this for parties and people devour it. I always get asked for the recipe (even from a woman who had also brought a 7 layer dip- she liked this one a lot more).  One thing I do is wait to put on the toppings until it is ready to be eaten.  This way the lettuce doesn't get soggy!

I made this dip for a potluck at work and everyone was raving about it! There was so much food at the potluck and my dip was the only thing that ran out! I'm already getting requests to make it again. The quality of the ingredients makes a difference. I used Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Pace salsa, freshly grated Cracker Barrel Sharp Cheddar Cheese, etc. Also, I omitted the lettuce and added cilantro on top for an extra boost of flavor. Definitely make this in a 13x9x2 pan. It fits very nicely.

Soooo good!  I added pickled jalapenos instead of the green pepper.  I didn't think raw green peppers sounded too great.  I used 2 green onions which was more than enough, and not even a quarter of the lettuce.  I can't imagine why you would need to use a whole head of iceburg (or how it would fit). Also, I only needed the smallest can of sliced olives for the garnish.  I think 6 oz. is way way too much.  I used my large corning ware dish because I brought it to a BBQ and needed a cover.  It is completely gone and everyone loved it.  I will make this one again. Thanks Sue!

Great recipe.  I added taco meat and forgot to add the cheese and it was still wonderful.  I can't wait to try it again WITH the cheese!  

The recipe is far too big to just have at home, so I keep all the ingredients ready but separate so we can eat it a few times in a week.  Too good to wait for a party to make!

Amazing, everyone loved this dip.  However, I made a change or two.  For starters I made my own refried black beans and doubled the amount.  I used two 15oz cans of black beans (drain but not completely), mashed them in a sauce pan, heated until warm, and added the following spices to taste: cumin, turick, white pepper, black pepper, salt, garlic, chili powder, and a little bit of oil.  Continue to heat until spices and oil are mixed in throughly.  Remove from heat add one and a half packets of taco seasoning. Any more and it will be too salty.  I also used yellow onions instead of green.  The taste was there, but I am sure the green onions give a better presentation.  But I used what was in the house because we are on a budget.

I made this for our SuperBowl get together.  WHAT A HIT!  I didn't use the green pepper or lettuce, because I agree with the other reviewers, - lettuce just doesn't hold up.  As for the green pepper - that was just a personal preference.  I did add  on advacado that I mashed and added some garlic salt and onion powder and put it in a little mound in the center - just in case some guests didn't like it....and also advacado ALWAYS turns grey/brown - no matter what little "trick" you use to keep it from doing so.  The flavor of this recipe was great!  You won't be disappointed.

I have made this for years and it is always requested also.  I put it in a springform pan and then set it in the middle of the platter with the chips around it.  It always looks nice that way.

This dip was awesome.  However I followed some tips of others and instead of using lettuce I used a guacamole dip I also found on this site.  It was also suggested that I use an 11X7 inch dish or something smaller and that was for sure wrong.  It most definitely needs a 13X7 dish!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes though. I would suggest making less sour cream and cream cheese mixture. I made what the recipe called for but I did not use it all because it was too much. I added jalapenos, roasted red peppers,  and omitted the tomatoes. This was a really good recipe as a base.

Terrific receipe. I realized today as I was making it that I hadn't reviewed it and I've been using this for years. I do have one big change which I recommend: I have found that the amount of sour cream and cream cheese to be too much; I basically halve the amount of both ingredients and mix THAT with the taco seasoning mix. That seems to be the "punch" the dish needs and what everyone notices as being "unique" from other taco dips. I use "spicy refried beans" too. I spread the beans, top with the sour cream mixture and let it sit overnight which really helps meld the flavor. If you can get fresh salsa (or make it yourself), it adds a nice freshness to the dish. I omit the green pepper and tomato and instead mix green onions with a one can of diced chilies which is very yummy. I use all the other ingredients. Very easy dish to customize.

Out of this world!  I have made it twice now for parties and it was always the most popular item.  I made some small changes to suite my taste.  I skipped the olives and the bell pepper.  I added a layer of guacamole on top of the salsa.  Instead of cheddar cheese I used the mexican blend of four cheeses.  Thank you for those of you who recommended draining the salsa and tomatoes on a paper towel because it really worked!  The dip was not watery at all.  Excellent recipe!

a classic recipe. I followed it to a T with the exception that I did not use green pepper. I've made a similar version of this in the past, where the taco seasoning was mixed with the sour cream mixture, rather than the beans. now that I've tried it this way, I much prefer this version. Also, the layer of salsa is key. I initially thought "why have salsa and tomato?" but having both really made it wonderful!

DELICIOUS! This dip is so easy to make, and it tastes great. I served it at a football party and everyone loved it. I put it in the oven for about 5 minutes to melt the cheese, YUM!

This was good. I omitted the lettuce and green pepper and used a black bean/corn salsa. The thought of canned olives is unappealing to me so I used green olives from a jar instead. Mixing the sour cream and cream cheese together formed this odd lumpy mixture so I might recommend making sure the cream cheese is at room temperature or maybe not mixing them together at all and adding them as seperate layers. These ingredients made A Lot of food. Everyone liked it so i'd say it was a hit.

This was my first time making this type of dip and it turned out quite well.  I did make a few minor modifications which I strongly recommend.  The changes are as follows: 1)Add half of the taco mix to the beans and add the other half of the mix to the cream cheese and sour cream mixture. 2) Leave out the lettuce, green onions, and tomatoes.  3) In place of the letteuce, green onions, and tomatoes add guacamole.  The guacomle should include onions and tomatoes mixed in (use one of the highly rated guacamole recipes on this website).  4) Layer the dip in the following order: beans (bottom), cream cheese/sour cream, guacamole, salsa, and cheese (top).

I made this dip for a party and it was the first thing to go!!  I doubled the beans and put half of the taco seasonings in the beans and half in the dairy layer.  I added a layer of guacamole (luvann's guacamole from this site) on top of the beans and left out the olives and green peppers.  This dip is SOOOOOO GOOD!!!

Not bad, but certainly not outstanding. I would suggest to put only half the package of taco mix. I mixed the taco seasonning with the sour cream as some reviewers suggested, but I think it would look better as in the original recipe (with the refried beans) to keep a white layer instead of two brownish layers.

TOTALLY YUM!!!!!  I ommitted the bell pepper as I don't like them and I added the taco seasoning mix to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Make sure you use a LARGE platter for this!  A normal dinner place size isn't quite big enough.  TASTY!

I've been making this for a few years now and my family and friends still ask me to make it!  In fact my MIL asked me to make it for her to bring to a party that I wasn't even invited too!  This dip is that good!

Start with a 9x13 glass pan (it's pretty to look at it through the glass).  I omit the bell pepper, use pinto beans (doubled to 32oz) and simmer them in water until softened -about 20 minutes - to refry them myself (I consider it healthier).  Sometimes, I'll use red onion instead, and always top it off with Jalepenos!  This will chill well, but be warned, only tough chips will do, unless you're using spoons.

I made this as an appetizer for a party last weekend, along with about seven other things. It was the ONLY thing to be completely gone at the end of the night. It was so tasty...and such a crowd pleaser.

This was a GREAT recipe! I made it for my sister's bridal shower and to say it was a hit is an understatement. I followed another user's suggestion and mixed one and a half packets of Fiesta Ranch Dip Mix (by Hiddden Valley) with the sour cream/cream cheese. I left the refried beans plain and chose not to add olives or green peppers. I also used medium Pace picante sauce to add a little "kick" in place of the salsa. I have another party coming up in a few weeks and will be making this again. Thanks!!

This was fabulous!  I made this along with some other appetizers and "make your own tacos" for a dinner party - everyone loved it!  It does serve a lot of people.  I have 14 people and there was just a tiny bit left!  Enjoy!

I made three batches of this with a few variations based on what I had on hand. Some had ground beef, one had guacamole. I didn't add the lettuce based on other reviewers. I heated them for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees before serving. These were gobbled up fast with lots of requests for the recipe. This may be my new go-to party recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!   I did make some simple changes based upon other reviews...used BLACK re fried beans (preference), added a layer of guac atop the crm cheez/sour crm mixture,  drained the salsa (needed 2 jars),  NO peppers, tomatoes or lettuce. Lots of cheez then the blk olives and green onions.  Theses changes really did not alter the taste of the recipe much, just kept it from being a wet mess. I will make this again and again...red peppers, corn, jalapeños may be added. I will also cut back on the amounts of sour cream and cream cheese...12 oz and 6 oz respectively...there was just too much. I used an 8X8 Pyrex. EASY AND DELCIOUS!

My friends couldn't stop until it was gone!  Said it was the best taco dip they'd ever had!   I omitted the olives and green peppers because I personally don't care for them.  I would recommend using a low-sodium seasoning mix if possible.  But overall a Great recipe!

I have made this dip for a Halloween party I was throwing - every single person LOVED it ! I had about 20 people and followed the exact servings above , I still had some left over. I did not use lettuce, green peppers and the tomatoes, the salsa had enough tomatoes! Olives were a great touch !

I lovvvvved this stuff. I omitted the green onions but everything else was a go. I don't even eat black olives but they were a great addition in this recipe. I had to stop making after the first time, because I almost ate the whole pan. I take it to any outing for a crowd.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I used a large pizza stone.  I used all the ingredients including the lettuce and it did not wilt.  It was just as yummy the following day too.  However, you may want to use a thick salsa because the salsa I used was just a little runny.

I made this for a church lunch and people loved it.  We have a very diverse group of people, and everyone really enjoyed it - in fact, they kept asking if one of the great chefs in our church had made it!

Only thing I omitted was the lettuce, because it did have to sit for a couple hours during church and I was worried about wilting.  That was it.  I used a 9X13 pan and it came out perfect.

Use Tostida Scoops! They are great for this dip!

LOVE IT! But instead of mixing the taco seasoning with the refried beans, I mix it with the sour cream and cream cheese (whipped makes it so much easier to mix!).

I also use black beans instead of refried when I have them on hand, because it gives less of a soggy mouth-feel when eating (so then I put the cream cheese on the bottom).

This came out pretty good, with only a couple changes.  I did NOT use the lettuce, or green pepper.  I DO recommend using a Thick and Chunky Salsa, or draining what you have real good.  All in all it came out tasty, and will make again.

We !!LOVED!! this recipe!!! I used to buy the layered dip from Sam's Club but never again! This recipe allows you to alter the spice level by the salsa you choose.  I didn't use the bell pepper or the olives as the recipe suggests (my kids are picky eaters) but I added corn & black beans to make up the layers...PERFECT dip!!! Next time I'll use guacamole as a layer!! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe and just what I was looking for! I was feeling a little lazy and got prechopped lettuce and tomatoes, so this was super quick too! Used low fat cream cheese and sour cream and it still tasted fabulous.

Next time I would either half the cream cheese/sour cream mixture or double the beans, Seemed a little off, but that's ok. I put some seasoning in the beans, but a majority of it in the cc/sc mixture, which i saw in another recipe. I could have eaten that alone! I layered the beans, cheese mixture and salsa and put it in the fridge to sort of marinate, and put the rest of the toppings on right before I served it. Left out the peppers and onions. Didn't seem right to me, and just enough olives on top for a lovely presentation. 

About the wateryness people are complaining about: Might be the salsa you're using. I used one that's real thick and chunky and that seemed to help. It was only after a few days in the fridge that it started to look a little watery. Was still yummy though.

I was really disappointed in this.  The salsa made it so runn it wasn't very good.    Will most likely have to throw quite a bit away as it didn't get ate.  Maybe would be better adding more tomato and leaving out the salsa.

I had made this dish for a party and wanted something that could be quick and filling.  I had added a layer of hamburger and decided to bake it for 1 hour.  I had nothing but great compliments for this dish and was a great hit.  I have now added this to my dishes when I need to bring something to a party.

I tried a different spin on this recipe. I layered a few soft taco shells on a cookie sheet. Added the remainder of ingredients and baked. You can eat it like a pizza..450 degrees 20min

Very good recipe. The cream cheese/sour cream layer makes it stand apart from other similar recipes. I leave off the lettuce so that anything that is left over can be eaten the next day.

It was too liquidy, so next time I wouldn't put as much salsa (or any) in it.  It made the lettuce wilt and it became runny.  Otherwise,  it was a great recipe.

Always a hit and easy to modify to your tastes. Sometimes I use taco sauce instead of the salsa. It doesn't keep well overnight so eat it up (lettuce and tomatoes get soggy and mushy).

Delicious!  I added a layer of Bob Cody's guacamole from this site, and omitted the chopped pepper.  Since I wanted to take this on a weekend camping trip, I didn't use fresh tomatoes or salsa because I was afraid it would get watery.  After reading other reviews, I used 2 cans of very well drained diced tomatoes with green chiles instead.  It worked out perfectly, and we were able to munch on it all weekend.  Everyone loved it.  I gave the recipe 5 stars in spite of making some changes to it because my changes were only to make it keep longer.   Preparing it as written is delicious and works out great if you're serving it the same day.

I made this for an after church gathering, and it was a huge hit.  I served it with Fritos Scoops instead of tortilla chips because they are a sturdier chip and can really "grab" all the yummy flavors.  Like other reviews, I agree that the beans and taco mixed together are very salty- so much so that I almost ditched the recipe at the beginning. However, when you add all the mild (sometimes bland if eaten alone) flavors of the veggies, sour cream, and cream cheese, it balances out great.  You've got to get every layer in your bite! lol  That's where the handiness of the scoops come in.  I also agree that the suggested size serving dish is too small.  Great go-to recipe in a pinch or for a party!

Amazing taco dip! I have gotten so many compliments on this dish. This dip is great even when I forgo the fresh tomato/green bell pepper in the winter when good tomatoes are hard to find. Great recipe and can be modified according to your preference.

Made this as an appetizer for the Superbowl.  The overall flavor was good, could have been a little spicier. I added a layer of homemade guacamole and then black beans on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer and omitted the lettuce.  My biggest disappointment was how watery it was. I had to soak up excess liquid with a paper towel after we started to eat it. I would suggest omitting the salsa or using a hearty variety (or drain liquid).  Will try again without salsa.

This is super easy and pretty forgiving as well as easy to change depending on what you have on hand. I'd definately make it in a 9 by 13 pan when I  make it again and use two cans of beans rather than one. We skip the green pepper but everything else was exactly as listed in the recipe. It was overflowing our pan because after reading the reviews we decided to use the 8 by 11. Anyway all in all a great recipe. We make it the night before but then add the veggies just before serving otherwise it can get a bit "wet" from the lettuce and tomatoes.

This was great dip! Made this for a New Years football watching party and decided to add a layer of 1lb ground beef seasoned with taco seasoning between the sour cream/cream cheese and the lettuce. It was DELISH! The hostess had been making short ribs, which didn't turn out very well. No one even noticed the lack ribs because this was such a meaty, wonderful, filling dip. Even the 6 yo loved it!

My friends and family gobble this up. However I substitute fresh Pico de Gallo for the salsa. I use a recipe from this site.

I love this dish.  Just made it for a holiday party and eveyone loved it!  I did use ground beef and added it above the bean mixture and I doubled the amount of beans used.  I also left out the lettuce and did use guacamole, very good!!

I've been making this for over a year now and everytime i have a dinner party i'm always asked to make this...only revisions I made was to omit the tomatoes, lettuce and olives, and put the dip in the oven (350 for 5 minutes or just enough for the cheese to melt) - simply amazing!!!

Very good, but I left out the lettuce and olives because of personal preference.  I tried this dip a few ways... one with scoops tortilla chips and also with fritos.  I liked the fritos myself, but my husband liked it with tortilla chips.  We also tried it cold and hot.  Preferred it hot.  This makes a pretty large dip.  Will make again.

A great, easy, quick and crowd-pleasing recipe.  I used bagged shredded cabbage in place of the lettuce and it stayed crunchy even after we reheated the leftovers as burrito filling.  Awesome!

I came across something like this years ago but haven't made it in a while.  I changed up a few things and it was great.  I used 2 cans beans because one wasn't enough then did the cream cheese sour cream, then chop meat, layer guac, cheddar, salsa, green onions and olives, more cheddar baked for 30 min then topped with lettice and tomato.  If by chance you have any left it tastes great cold the next day. 
The 2 reoccurring low reviews talked about it being runny and not spicy enough. How about draining some of the extra water out of the salsa. As far as the seasoning goes, you can spice up just about every layer until it suits your tastes. Use jalepenos, tabasco, spicy salsa and guac (if you used it) Being able to control the level of seasoning in this is one of the positives. I've made it in three smaller trays one mild, one medium and one on fire. There is never a bite left of any.

This is a good dip in itself but also a great starting point for creating a layered dip to suit your taste completely.  Next time, I will omit the green peppers and lettuce because I didn't care for them in this dip and add a layer of guacamole.  I'm going to try a packet of Hidden Valley Fiesta Ranch seasoning in place of the taco seasoning since I am a huge fan of it and would like to see how it tastes in this dip.  I will also do what a few other reviewers suggested and put some seasoning in the sour cream/cream cheese layer.  Overall, 4 stars for the original recipe!

Outstanding! Was a hit for our playoff party. I had an avocado on hand so I mixed that with the cream cheese and made it a layer and then made the sour cream a layer. Very yummy!

This is a good recipe and every bite was eaten! It definitely fits in a 9x13" dish. Changes: I added a tub of refrigerated guacamole dip on top of the refried beans. I used 2 cans rotel instead of tomatoes and omitted lettuce and bell peppers. Very good!

OMG this was so good!  I put the taco seasoning into the sour cream/cream cheese mix.  I don't like sour cream, but with the cream cheese and taco seasoning it added a creamy deliciousness to this dish.  My layers were beans, sour cream mix, guacamole (store bought souped up with fresh cilantro and fresh onions), fresh salsa, and mexican cheese blend.  I baked this for about half an hour at 350 and then topped with chopped green onions and chopped black olives.  Delicious!!!  This is a keeper, for sure.

This turned out great!!  It made two pie plates worth, one spicy, one not.  For the spicy one, I mixed 1/2 can green chillies with 1/2 the taco seasoning into the beans and spread in the bottom of the pie plate, mixed the fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream, 1/2 the taco seasoning, 1/2 can green chillies and spread that on the bean layer, spread the medium salsa next, layered light cheddar cheese and Jalapeno Monteray jack, then diced green onions and diced tomatoes, sliced olives and diced & sliced jalapeno pepper.  Baked in oven at 350 for 30 minutes and served with toasted baguette slices and assorted crackers.  It was a huge hit!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Wow! I brought this to work and they inhaled it. Very delicious and satisfying. Wouldn't change a thing on the original recipe here. Definitely suggest making the bottom layer ahead of time and then adding the salsa, veggies and cheese right before serving.

I made this last night for a party and it was a big hit.  I gave it 4 stars because, as written, it would have been too mild for the crowd I run with.  Here are the modifications I made. After reading that this dish can come out runny, I cut back on the salsa to about 3/4 of what was called for.  Also, I used roma tomatoes-  I cut out the seeds and only used the flesh.  For the sour cream and cream cheese mix, I added cayene pepper and a splash of lemon juice for a little extra zip.  I also used diced fresh jalepenos as we Texans like the heat!  I too omitted the letuce for fear that if it were sitting out for too long, it would wilt.  I will definately be making this again!

This was a big hit when I made it. The cream cheese/sour cream mix made it very creamy, and everyone went back for seconds. I added a layer of guacamole dip just because I like the flavor. I would recommend making this in a very wide dish, I made mine in a tall glass container, and people couldn't seem to get to all the layers at once.

Delicious! To start with, I didn't use lettuce, green onions, or peppers, and I didn't use the taco seasoning. I put this in a 2-quart casserole as I planned to bake it.   I used the beans for the first layer, then the cream cheese/sour cream mixture for the second layer, homemade guacamole for layer three, diced tomatoes next, then sliced olives, then salsa (I used fresh chunky salsa and drained it well). I covered it entirely in shredded cheddar and baked at 350 for about 35 minutes.   It was a total hit with everyone who was there, and I handed out the recipe to a lot of people who tried it. Thanks!

Very good, and went over well at my party. Just be careful that you don't overdo it on the taco seasoning - my package was a little over the 1 oz it called for and it was too strong. Next time I may cut it in half. Very good recipe though!

Excellent dip!  However, I spread each layer out on a large platter so you can easily scoop your chip through all the layers.

I've loved this Dip ever since I was a girl! I use a 9x13 pan, but it fills it to the top, so I'd recommend going a little bigger. I don't use the tomato, bell pepper, or onions in mine. Great recipe! Great snack for after school or even a light dinner!

Fantastic taco dip! And so much of it too. The only thing I left out of it, like many others, was the lettuce.

This was the best 7 layer Mexican dip that I ever had. I made a couple of changes.  I put a layer of guacamole between the cream cheese/sour cream layer and the salsa layer.  I left out the lettuce.  This was a huge hit at the party. In fact I ran out of tortilla chips, so people just started eating it plain.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great base recipe!!  I mix black beans with the refired beans and taco seasoning. I also mix a packet of ranch dressing mix in the sour cream and cream cheese. Any salsa seems to work fine. I top the salso with a can of corn. No lettuce and no bell pepper for me on this one, they don't seem to belong here. I replace the lettuce with chopped cilantro for a fresh taste and mix with the green onions. Top with cheese and your done!!

I love this recipe, but like others tweeked it to my personal taste.  I added a layer of taco seasoned chopped chicken or ground beef after the beans.  Then added chopped bell pepper, onion, green onion, and tomato.  Topped that with shredded mexican cheese and melt in the oven.  Next I add a layer of salsa,a layer of lettuce, a layer of guacamole and a layer of the sour cream mixture. Lastly I sparcely top the sour cream with the leftover chopped vegetable and sliced black olives.  This recipe is both hot and cold when immediately served, beautiful to look at through a glass serving bowl, and I never have any leftover to bring back when I bring it to parties

I liked the zip from the taco seasoning. Mixed it into refried black beans, which are even better then pinto beans.  Also just used plain sour cream instead of mixing it with cream cheese. best spread in a deep dish pie pan.

I have made this twice for large group gatherings.  It was LOVED both times.  My husband can't get enough of this dish.  I did change it a bit as recommended by others ... I used a good guacamole recipe off of allrecipes.com and took out the lettuce.  I used fewer black olives and also made it in a 9x13 casserole dish.  It worked great to have it shallow as everyone could get some of each layer.  This will be a staple potluck dish in our house!  THANKS!

I used 1 lb. of ground beef with 1/2 of the taco seasoning mix for the first layer, then the sour cream and cream cheese mixture with the other 1/2 of the taco seasoning mix for the second layer. Then I layered lettuce, cheese, diced tomatoes and the black olives (No green pepper and no salsa). I put it into two round quich dishes and put one dip out at the beginning of the party and put the other half out later in the evening. Serve with El Ranchero Tortilla Chips (2 bags).

Dint use the jar salsa, lettuce (gets soggy, yuk) or green pepper. I layered the bottom with (fat free) bean mixture (used chipotle taco seasoning to mix with FF beans), then reduced fat crm cheese & ONLY 8 oz. fat free sr crm mixture, then I used guacamole on top, then 2% ched cheese, then chopped fresh tomatoes and then grn onions. I doubled the recipe for a cookout, used frito scoops and tortilla chips and the 13x9 dish was wiped clean! Thanks for a grt starter recipe that I could tweak to my own liking :)

I thought this recipe was fabulous! I did make a few adjustments: added 2 chopped jalepenos, 1 chopped avacado, zest of 1 lime, doubled the cream cheese, and used a blend of grated cheeses. I also omitted the beans as my husband will not enter the same room with them. Thanks for a great recipe!

I make a dip very similar to this ALL the time for work spreads, minus the beans to keep the quiet work atmosphere. :)  I've also found that if you use sliced green olives and chopped black olives it makes a very pretty and varied appearance and texture. Yum!

Amazing!  I have never made a layer dip before and I thought this was just going to be like any other dip, but it was surprisingly really good.  We had 12 people over and it was enough for munching, everyone raved about it.  I did not use the fresh veggies, didn't want people picking around them.  I also served jalapenos and the black olives on the side. I will be making this for my next party. YUM!

True favorite.  Instead of refried beans I put pinto beans in the food processor with some hot sauce and just half the packet of taco seasoning to cut down on the fat and salt.  Also only used half a container of sour cream so it would be thicker consistency.  Very good.

Excellent dip!  Took it to my Christmas office party and everyone loved it.  There was alot of fancy foods there and they all wanted the recipe for this dip.  I did add a layer of chopped avacodo and omitted the green bell peppers (yuck).  I used hot picante sauce and hot taco seasoning.  Excellent!  Thanks!

I omitted the lettuce, onions, tomato and green bell pepper and replaced it with black beans and guacamole. I also mixed in 1/2 the seasoning into the refried beans and the other 1/2 into the cream cheese/sour cream mix. My 
"taste testers" wanted to see a heavier guacamole (I used dip quality, light guacamole), more cheese (I used 2 cups, instead of 1), and a spicier salsa (I used medium). They loved the dip and can't wait for me to make it again. I am excited to make this recipe even better than it already is!

I made this for potluck at work around the superbowl, and it was the first thing gone! I seasoned the hamburger meat with taco seasoning, and layered it on top of the bean mix.  I left out the bell pepper, but added a small can of green chilis. Very good.

I added homemeade guacamole as an extra layer and mixed fresh chopped cilantro to the vegetable layer.  I thought it was good, but some people are weird about avocados, onions, cilantro, black olives, etc.  I think next time I'll make a more basic recipe for a party.  If you double this recipe, do it without the tomatoes and lettuce.  We had some dip leftover, which didn't really last because of the fresh veggies.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but sounds great with the cream cheese. I have tried one close though. Add 1/4 or less med. salsa & 1 can gr. chiles to the refried beans(for spice) so you don't have to drain juice off the salsa,lettuce won't wilt. The taco seasoning to the sour cream & cream cheese. Then add all the other toppings, specially the tomatoes. Shredded lettuce works great. Thought this might help some of the reviews

all the guys at poker night loved it...  I used a 31oz can of refried beans, added a layer of corn (drained) between the green peppers and the green onions, and used black beans on top instead of olives...  I made it in a 13x9 pan and it stands about 1 inch above the top rim!

I thought I had a nice recipe for taco dip, but this is just the best!!!! I took this to a bridal shower tonight and everyone loved it. I was hoping I'd have a little left over to give to my husband. I had just enough for him. People were going up for seconds and several asked me for the recipe. It's so quick, easy, and yummy with corn chips.
I omitted the olives because I don't like them and I also left out the green peppers. I added half the packet of taco seasoning to the beans and then the other half to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Absolutely fantastic!!! Will make again and again!!!!

Brilliant! I took it to a party last night & it was a hit! I made my own taco seasoning from a recipe on this site and did not use lettuce, tomato, or pepper. I did feel the need to use 2 jars of salsa (drain it!) and I mixed half of the taco seasoning in the beans and half in the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. And instead of just sliced olives on top, I arranged alternating rows of olives and sliced jalapenos.  Also, I used 2 cups of a Mexican cheese blend instead of just cheddar.  Yum!

I used to bring this dip to parties years ago and was happy to find it again. I made a few changes: Use cilantro/tomato instead of salsa, add 5 mashed avocados mixed with lime juice and garlic, cooked the refried beans in some bacon fat and added garlic...then whipped in a little milk to make it creamy. Top with roasted green chilies, tomatoes, olives,a little bit of onion and mexican cheese.
Then, go on a serious diet for about 3 days because this recipe is full of calories and fat...but very good!

Wow!!!!  The whole family loved this one, even the kids!  I followed the recipe exactly but added some extra diced tomato and I put it all in an 11x14 baking dish so that I could transport it to a church dinner easily.  Next time I will add an extra green pepper.  I think the cream cheese/sour cream layer makes the dish!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I have made this 3 times in the last 2 months. It is fantastic, and very easy. It only takes minutes to put it together. Other 7 layer dips include ground beef and I think it taste funny when it is chilled, not to mention takes more time to do. The combo of the sour cream and cream cheese is heavenly. Nobody could figure out what that layer was. I have gotten rave reviews from all that have dug into it. Superb!!!

This recipe was awesome!  Everyone at the party brought chips and salsa and this was the only one touched.  I made it on one of those large plastic serving platters you can get at the dollar store.  Was perfect.  I may even use another can of beans and maybe put more olives in the middle of the layers as we love black olives and they were just rolling off the top.  Great served with those Torengos chips! YUMMY!  Making this again for another party and my hubby said he would eat this everyday!

A+++++  THE ONLY THING YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE IS NOT MAKE ENOUGH!!!  WHENEVER I AM PUTTING THIS DIP TOGETHER EVERYONE SWARMS AROUND ME TRYING TO GET AT IT BEFORE IT IS FINISHED.. I MIX THE TACO SEASONING WITH THE SOUR CREAM RATHER THAN THE REFRIED BEANS BUT THATS JUST MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE..YOU'VE GOTTA TRY THIS!!!

This type of layered taco dip is very popular here on the West coast. This is yet another variation. And ya know what......they're all so good. Before I started into step three I nuked it in the microwave for about 1 minute, the proceeded with step three. Really good Sue!

This is similar to a recipe I used 40 years ago.   I mixed an 8 oz container of French Onion Dip instead of cream cheese with the sour cream.  I also put the toppings in individual bowls and we add our own.  We dip the amount of the dip we want and warm it in the microwave for 15-20 seconds...then we add our toppings.  Toppings:  jalapeños, lettuce onions, avocados,.  I layer the green chilies and sliced olives.

Great recipe. I've had 7-layer dip at work during potlucks and i've always enjoyed this dip. I followed the recipe exactly, minus olives because I dont care for them and this was amazing! I like the crunch it had due to the green pepper and green onions. So easy to make also.....totally recommend.

I absolutely love Mexican food and this recipe was no different. I left out the green bell pepper and the black olives just due to my family's preference and I used a southwest chipotle salsa. It was fantastic! Will be making again and again!

Super easy to make and everyone loves it. I have used it as chip dip, put it on an omelette, and put it in tortillas for vegetarian tacos. I use spinach in mine and leave out the black olives. Very easy to make your own.

I followed the recipe as written. Next time I will add black beans as someone else suggested and I will cut the amount of cream cheese and sour cream in half. There was too much cream cheese and sour cream for me. Overall, you cannot mess this recipe up and my kids and husband gobbled this up! By the way......I preferred this warm so I warmed my serving up in a bowl in the microwave for about 15 seconds to knock the chill off.

Could not stop eating! Instead of standard retried beans I used 3 28oz cans of Goya red kidney beans. I warmed them up in a pot. I mixed Picante Medium Salsa in the beans about 8oz or so. Also mixed two packs of Sazon. Mixed them together cooked for about ten minutes. I drained the beans and mixed three packs of Taco seasoning. Instead of lettuce I used guacamole. I would have made my own but I was in a rush so I used 4 11oz jars of Herrs Guacamole & believe it or not their guacamole has a lot of flavor- it's just not thick. I also skipped the green onions. I did & used everything else as the recipe shows. Great, easy party favorite.

I loved the cream cheese addition to this taco dip. I added a layer of guacamole with jalepeno on top of the sour cream / cream cheese layer to add some additional flavor and zing.

Make this recipe with you're own refried beans.  Add your own fresh deep fried tortillas.  And.. never forget the guacamole as your last layer.

I made this for a pig roast the other night and it was a huge hit.  Within two hours of opening the lid it was completely gone.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  I made it again last night for some friends but I cut the sour cream/cream cheese mixture in half and I enjoyed it even more. I also found a chunkier, hotter salsa than I had used before.  I used vegetarian refried beans both times since I'm vegetarian.  This is so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I served it with regular tortilla chips and Doritos. I loved the Doritos with it.

My kids love this! I think its better in a shallow pan or platter vs 13x9 glass, but is good either way. I always make sure to get it very cold before serving.

I've been looking for a really good layered dip and I've found it! The only changes I made was I put "two cans of refried beans with roasted chiles" into the taco mix (all I could taste with one can was salt, two cans were perfect) I did use all the beans which was good, but next time I think I'll only use half and save half for another time. I also used "light" sour cream and "reduced calorie" cream cheese, and I could not tell the difference. Also I did the layers the same EXCEPT I switched it around when it came to the lettuce, cheese and olives. I put the shredded cheddar cheese, then the lettuce, then the olives. I found I liked the look of it better, AND I could make the layered dip a day ahead (up to the cheese layer), then the next day I chopped up the lettuce (so no wilting and stayed crisp), then added the olives. This took hardly any time to do that, and I think this tastes better if made a day ahead. I'm not one for very spicy food, but I liked the flavor of this without all the heat. If you do like it hotter you can spice it up by using refried beans with a lot more kick. One more thing I'll mention (I know someone else commented) in the video I was turned off by her whole hand (up to her knuckle) going into the dip when she scooped it out with the chip. My solution for this is I put a tablespoon in the dish, so people could scoop it out with the spoon and put it on the nacho chip (worked for me). I will be making this again. Thank you Sue for a great recipe!

I liked it but it didn't like me. The Taco mix with the beans gave both me and my girlfriend heartburn. I think there was too much dairy too...I'd skip the cream cheese If I did it again and maybe very the layers to put the tomatoes and salsa on different layers. I don't think I'll do this one again

I loved this dish, I only changed a few things. I deleted the bell pepper because the salsa had some in it. I also used chopped olives instead of sliced, and I chopped the lettuce because the shredded would still dangle from the chip and people would drip. I also used avocado, but I cut it once it was ready to serve because it would brown.

I start with a can of Dennison Original Chile Beans.  Makes a big difference.  Everyone is surprised by the different taste of the chile. Put the sour cream on top of it when layering. Sooo good. Never have a bit leftover. I am not a fan of taco seasoning and do not need it with the chili.

No green pepper. I also add taco seasoned ground beef. I put the beef on the bottom, add refried beans, sour cream, guacamole,cheddar cheese, salsa,lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives and sliced green onion. It's always a hit. With or without the meat, this dish is a definite keeper.

Not a good taco dip recipe.  It wants to be a salad but has a multiple-personality disorder.  No one ate this at the party I took it to.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The taco spices should NOT be mixed with the beans as it makes them too salty and the spices taste raw.  Better to mix them with the sour cream mixture.  Also, the lettuce and green peppers had no business being there.  The green peppers took away from the over-all dish and the lettuce just ended up being watery and wilted.  I ended up taking the entire dish home and trying to eat it throughout the week as a chicken taco salad just to not waste it all.  I will not be making this again.

I make this every year for our Christmas get together. I like to make my own guacamole and add that to the dip. 2 soft avocados, 1/3c chopped onion, 1tbsp lime juice, salt & pepper to taste. mash avocados and add the rest. So much better than store bought.

This was good but I did something by mistake and loved it. I added the cream cheese to the refried beans and taco seasoning. Then i topped with sour cream and other ingredients. It was delicious. Will make many more times.

The first time I made this was for my daughter's party. Everyone raved about it, and I'm making it again for a friend's 25th anniversary party. I didn't do the lettuce and tomato topping, and I used a pre-made guacamole. I made it in a pie plate, but found that the salsa was too runny and made somewhat of a mess on the outside of the plate, so  be sure to use a deep enough dish. Great dish for any party.

I make this in a triffle dish and it is beautiful!  My only change is that I add a layer of guacamole!  It's perfect for any type of shower, because it's easy to make, and yet looks so impressive!

I halved the recipe but wish I had added all the beans. I also omitted the olives because I don't like them.  Very good dip!

In stead of the sour cream and cream cheese I use one container of Jalapeno dip and one container of avocado or guacamole dip.  It is excellent.

Had to come up with inexpensive but tasty munchies for 200 people for a friends 80th birthday party and made this - quadrupled the recipe, using the "Refried Beans without the Refry" from this site.  Also made salsa since several of us putting the party together had tomatoes from the garden. Made it for a Christmas party and Chamber of Commerce After Hours gathering according to recipe, it is economical, feeds a lot of people and is just great!!!!!!  As one friend said, tasting it for the first time "it's one of those tastes that has so many flavors you just want to keep eating it!"  After making this so many times, a few easy tips.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It's a great replacement for anything calling for sour cream.  Rotel Diced tomatoes with chilies (Mild)(or your grocery store House brand) is an inexpensive replacement for Salsa, if you stock up on it as I do when its on sale.  Zip it up with some bottled hot sauce.  I have also used canned diced tomatoes, canned chilies and some of the taco  seasoning for the salsa layer.  I bought some ready made guacamole for a "special" party and layered it in.  I don't think anyone was counting the layers!!

Great recipe.  I agreed with the other readers in adding a layer of guacamole.  I also added ground beef to the refried bean layer to add a little stability.  I love spicy food so I highly recommend adding canned or jarred jalapenos on top depending on your taste and drizzle a little bit of Frank's Red Hot Sauce on top for color and spice.... Amazing!  Thank you for the recipe!

Only change was to mix 1/2 of the taco package with the sour cream, otherwise did everything exactly as written.  Wonderful recipe, didn't all get eaten at the party - but hubby made short work of the leftovers the next day.  Great!

Very good. I mixed the salsa into the cream cheese layer, and did not use a green bell pepper...just a personal preference. Went over very well, my son seemed to be in heaven. Will definitely make again

Used this recipe as a base, but modified it for our tastes - layered it refried beans, homemade guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and cheddar cheese on top.  Made the night before, and served cold the following day with tortilla chips - delicious!

I've made this for our Halloween party at work two years in a row now and it's always a hit.  I add the lettuce on top last and do a spider web of sour cream.  It helps the lettuce stay crisp and adds a bit of whimsy.  I love this recipe, just be sure to eat it up in a day as it does get watery.

I made this to take to a neighborhood potluck and it was a hit. I made it just like the recipe except I didn't use black olives. It was gone within minutes. I made it in a 9x13 pan and thought it fit perfectly. I also used romaine lettuce and it didn't wilt at all. I have found my potluck recipe. Easy to make and very yummy.

This is amazing - I have tried a lot of taco dip recipes and this is by far the favorite.  I love how easy it is.  We never seem to get the lettuce tomato, pepper, olives or onions on it before it is partially gone. It is easy to make and ingredients I have on hand when my son informs me his friends are coming over for a campfire - the teenagers stand by the plate and enjoy - thanks for the recipe!

Makes a lot - perfect for a very large party.  I drained the chunky salsa and also used Rotel chopped tomatoes, drained, in place of the fresh tomatoes.  Added a layer of store bought guacamole and served with scoops.  The lettuce was a nice addition and it did not get soggy.  Agree with other suggestions and added only 1/2 a pkg of taco seasoning, it was more than enough....very easy to put together and it was loved by all.  A definite for every BIG party we have!

What an easy tasty dish!  I made it w/o the lettuce b/c we were going to be outside for a while and don't personally like wilted lettuce. Forgot to soften the cream cheese so it was somewhat chunky but still tasted great. It was overflowing in the 8x8 dish that I used, oops.

This recipe had too much sour cream and cream cheese.  I made it for a Father's Day cook-out and YUCK.  So much left over!  I would not make this recipe again or I would cut the sour cream and cream cheese in 1/2.

We had a potluck at work and I have yet to find a dish that everyone here enjoys until I found THIS recipe. OMG I had nothing left. They devoured this. It pleased the vegi eaters, it pleased the cheese freaks, it even pleased the die hard meat eaters. Definitely will be making this one again. :)

Great but make sure you have a REALLY big platter and make sure it has edges to contain the liquid.  Especially if you need to transport it.

Great recipe. I will use again. Here are the changes I made: Use two can's of beans but only one packet of taco seasoning, halve the cream cheese/sour cream mixture, leave out lettuce and green peppers. Yum!

Ok I have made this twice and it's been a hit both times. I did not use green pepper and only used all our the sourcream and cream cheese the recipe called for when I doubled the batch. Otherwise it would be too much. This is quick and so so good. I make it 10 minutes before we are walking out of the door.

good dip. should have more beans. there is far too much sour cream/cream cheese and salsa. the salsa really waters it down which makes it really soggy/runny. not a dip that should sit out a while and does not make very good leftovers. but still delicious. thank you!

Even better the next day!  If I made it again I might use less sour cream/cream cheese mix, and maybe a little less taco seasoning, but over all a very pretty presentation in a glass bowl.

Second time I made it the salsa I used was watery and ruined the whole presentation...

This is SO good!   Next time I make it I am going to cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half.  That layer was thicker than the rest and seem to over power the rest of the layers - plus it is really the only unhealthy layer.  I added a layer of guacomole which made it even better.  I left out the lettuce only because it seemed like it would make it harder for people to dip and scoop with a chip.  And I recommend using 'finely' shedded cheese for the same reason.

This was okay.  I think guacamole would have kicked it up a notch and pico de gallo instead of the tomatoes, green onion, and bell pepper.  Olives were also an odd addition... I don't think I like the pairing.  Good base recipe though!

Yum.  Easy to make and fresh.  I doubled the recipe for a large party.  I only need 1/2 of the sour/cream cheese mix and 1/2 the salsa.  Very good.

Made this for a baby shower this weekend... Was asked many times for the recipe...  I did double it and served it in a 9 X 13 dish.  I would probably only use one package of the taco seasoning the next time.. I thought it was alittle salty... but everyone loved it..

this recipe was a hit!! i took it to a potluck party... lets just say there were 3 taco dips there this recipe was the only one that was gone! the other two probably had one spoonful gone from their pans.! I did add some ground beef into the beans and taco meat.. i did not add the lettuce at all.. If i was serving it immediately i would have added the lettuce. thanks for sharing!

This dip is very watery due to the salsa.  I've had other 7 layer dips with better flavor and more zip.  Not sure what was missing from this.  Would not make again.

This was a HUGE hit at the party I took it to.  Small changes - I mixed the taco seasoning with the cream cheese/sour cream layer and I left out the bell pepper.  I used about 6 leaves of lettuce, and I put some on top of the sour cream layer and then some on with the other veggies.  Everyone raved!

Who doesn't love a good seven layer dip? Hands down when I need a seven layer dip, this is the one I always make. I especially like adding the taco seasoning to the refried beans. Watch out for the extra sodium it adds! But it's delish!

Yum! I didn't have refried beans, so ended up subbing chili (strange I know, but still good) for that layer.  Did the 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 cream cheese layer with taco seasoning as suggested and that layer was awesome! Next time, I'll use the right beans, eliminate the lettuce, and add a layer of guacamole (like this time) & it should be perfect!

Fabulous and easy. A definite crowd pleaser. I did drain the salsa very well and it came together wonderfully.

This is a staple at any get together. It was a cinch to prepare. I made this as a last second thing for a Super Bowl party and it was great. Next time I will use a shallower dish though. I made this in an 8x8 pan (close to it). This meant people had to actually scoop the dip out and onto their plates. I personally like dipping right from the platter, so next time its a shallower dish! Be wary of the double dippers however :)

This was a great recipe, I really liked the use of sour cream and cream cheese.  I omited the lettuce and sprinked the sour cream mix with a little smoked paprika DELISH!!! I am making is again for the next get together :)

This recipe is AMAZING. And being pregnant, after the party I was able to snack on the leftovers right out of the dish. So so good. I did follow a suggestion from a previous review that opted out on the lettuce because it would start to wilt and the dip was still great. I love it and everyone at the party asked for the recipe. Needless to say I will be making this again.

I don't think this could be emphasized enough... drain the salsa!! I had read that some people did it, but I chose to skip it when I made it. Big mistake! It was soupy.  It didn't ruin the dish, it just didn't look as nice. Also, I baked mine at 350 for 15 minutes, just enough to melt the cheese and heat everything to a similar temperature. I added hamburger to my taco sauce (skipped the beans) and it was good! I couldn't stand the thought of warm hamburger, that's why I heated it. Plus, I saw another reviewer did the same. We made this a main meal!

Although layered taco salads are very common, this one is excellent.  The flavors and combination of ingredients makes this one a winner.

Amazing!!!  I made this for a b-day dinner as an appetizer and everyone ate it before and with dinner.  It was the favorite part of the dinner believe it or not.  I left out the bell pepper, put it in an 8 X 8 and it was perfect.  I didn't change anything else, why mess with perfection??  I'm not sure how anyone could think it was lacking flavor, it was amazing and I'll be making it from now on!

Very good! I layered it in a trifle dish but found it was really difficult for my guests to dig all the way to the bottom.  It sure was pretty though! But best to use a shallow dish for serving.

Made it tonight for super bowl Sunday. As some other reviewers had suggested, I also swapped the lettuce out for Guacamole and the green peppers for pickled jalepnos.  I also omitted the salsa, but used a salsa guacamole mixture instead. So I guess, mine was more of a 6-layer dip.  But either way, it was terrific!

I LOVE this recipe!  A couple of notes: I had to buy the reduced sodium taco seasoning.  Regular taco seasoning is just too salty..and I LOVE my salt!  Also, if the dip isn't eaten right away, you may find it to get watery after awhile.  I'm pretty sure this is due to the salsa.  It's still great!!  One more thing.  I took the others' advice and instead of tomatoes and lettuce, I made guacamole and then added chopped green onions.  Wonderful!

Let's face it, this is a party dip and aren't we all looking for something to WOW our guests?   Well, there's no WOW factor in this one.  I think the sour cream and cream cheese are too bland and bring the dish down in flavor.  Will keep looking for another recipe.   Not sure why this has such great reviews... maybe they are rating this WITH changes?

It is definitely a very presentable snack to be displayed on the table. I made this for Christmas eve family gathering and my family loves it. I could not find fried bean in the store so I just got a can of red bean and followed the recipe, mixing up with the taco seasoning mix. I made a mistake when adding the salsa in. I should have poured away the excess salsa juice in the jar before pouring in the whole thing in. Thats why the dip became kinda watery at the middle part due to the juice. Will definitely make this again but will do it half size!

Great recipe!  I made this and used some suggestions others added.  I mixed the refried beans with taco seasoning and I added homemade guacamole instead of lettuce.  Nixed the peppers, tomatoes, and olives.  I added diced tomatoes into the guacamole already plus with the chunky salsa there was a lot of tomato to begin with!  I also used the refried beans that had green chiles in it for a kick.  It was a big hit with everyone at our event.  Half of it was gone within 20 minutes!  Definitely would make again.

So good you can't stop eating!! I love it w/ the lettuce and I also like to add some fresh cilantro. You can't go wrong. Add or leave out what you want. It's awesome. ******UPDATE*****.  I think there is too much sour cream/ cream cheese for the amount of beans, so next time I will either use 2 cans of beans or cut the sour cream/cream cheese in half. Also, the way it is, a 13x9 pan is too small. I also think the sour cream/cream cheese is sorta bland, but maybe if you cut it in half, it wouldn't be. I will next time put taco seasoning in it or maybe some salt and lime juice. It does get better when refrigerated overnight.

Mmmmm...so good!  This only fed about 10 hungry people.  I skipped the green pepper because I don't like them.  I added a layer of guacamole.  I found that the lettuce wilted and made a big puddle of juice.  I'd suggest having the lettuce near the top of the layers to prevent this and serve as soon as possible.

This was a good recipe.  It is very versatile and you can add or delete ingredients as you like.  I made it for a party and it was a hit.  One tip, though, if you want to make it the night before it is easy to do except for the topping.  The lettuce wilted and absorbed the salsa and didn't look quite as pretty but it still tasted good.  Just put all the other ingredients in the dish and have your chopping done and add the lettuce, green peppers, and olives right before you serve it.  Easy and pretty.

I make this for darn near every family gathering that I have at my home. Last time I made it, my guests had the whole thing eaten in an hour.   I recommend using your own homemade salsa to take it up a notch, stirring in some homemade taco seasoning in with the sour cream and adding a couple good squeezes of lime into the refried beans. Using a blend of Mexican cheese is a nice touch, too.

Instead of a layer of lettuce, I put a layer of homemade guacamole.  This was really good, and can definitely feed a crowd.  It made a ton!  We made burritos the next day with leftovers.

This is a gret recipe!  I've taken it to many different parties and everyone loves it.  The only thing that I do is slightly drain the salsa.  I found out that it can make the runny if you don't.  Kudos!!!

Made this for my boyfriends potluck at work.  They absolutely loved it! It was his second week at work at his new job and now everybody talks to him because of this dip.  Even the sup that he had bad blood yesterday kept telling him that it was the most delicious thing he's ever ate and now things are cool.

Very good, I followed the recipe exactly, however, the first time I made it I tried another user's suggestion to pop it in the oven and it didn't turn out well at all.  The second time I made it for a party I chilled the whole dish for a couple hours and it was a total hit! Everyone loved it.

Changed this up a bit per other reviewer's suggestions.  Added a layer of store bought guac., added some green onions to the cream cheese/ sour cream mixture as well as on top.  Omitted the lettuce, tomatoes, and bell peppers because we made it to have around for a few days to snack on and diddn't think these ingredients would hold up well for maore than a day.  Also, used low sodium taco seasoning.  We like it alot.  I made it in a casserole dish but next time I will use a 9x13 pan as the instructions state so that the layers will be thinner and easier to dip chips into.  With the deep casserole dish you kind of went layer by layer when dipping intead of getting some of each ingredient.  Will make this again.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  It fits perfectly in a trifle bowl as shown.  I will make this for every party that I attend or host from now on!  Very tasty!  I did not expect it to be anything special, but the excellent reviews turned me onto this recipe.

I make this often but mix the taco seasoning with the cream cheese and sour cream instead of with the refried beans! Make sure you serve this in a 9x13 and with a serving spoon as this is hard to dip chips into without breaking the chips.  You can alter this so many ways and it is always great and easy to prepare.

As per other reviews I added guac atop the sour cream mixture, and seasoned ground beef atop the beans, drained the salsa I used a 9x13 pyrex. The presentation looked nice through the glass. Altough I had to use a can and a half of beans because 1 can did not cover the bottom. It turned out supper yummy and was a big party hit. I ate it with Tostitos white corn chips but next time I will try a thicker corn chip because the dip is very heavy and the chips tended to break. I doubled the recipe and made 7 layer burritos for dinner the next night. Was ever better the second day. Will def make again.

yum. easy, too. but it's missing something key: avocados. and my friend suggesting next time mixing the taco mix with the sour cream/cream cheese instead of the bean; half in both would add a kick to both layers.

This was Excellent !!! I added the taco seasoning to 2 cans of refried beans the night before.I used all the ingredients but not as much as called for(except the beans).I did not use a whole green pepper or a whole head of lettuce or the whole can of olives.I did use 2 cups of shredded cheese. This was Wonderful!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe

A very good tasting dip.Make sure to use a large,flat platter or dish to serve this on. It makes alot,and if the dish is too small,it gets really tall on the plate,and its hard to serve. But it was good,and I'd make it again.:)

Great dip! I used a can of spicy refried beans for a little more zip and eliminated the green peppers. Everyone enjoyed it.

This was excellent.  We shared it for a large Thanksgiving party, and I received calls the next day asking for the recipe.  I added red peppers which added a wonderful sweetness.  I did cut back on the salsa, nixed the black olives and used 1/2 bagged shredded lettuce.  It was rather tall on the platter, but with the Scoops as chips, it was perfect.  My sister-in-law using the guacamole dip found in near the sour cream instead of using the cream cheese/sour cream.

I made this for a work party once, and now every time we have a get together I have to bring "The Dip."  If I want to try something new I have to bring the new thing and "The Dip."  One suggestion...I serve this with very thin layers on a jelly roll pan.  I find it so much easier to get everything on one chip that way.

Best taco dip ever! People love it every time and it goes very quickly! I sometimes substitute light cream cheese, light sour cream, and fat free refried beans and you can't even tell the difference.

Made it for a holiday buffet, doubled it and it was still completely gone.  It is really good, and everyone loves it.  I left out lettuce and added some black beans and corn - yum!  Made it the day before and it was still fab.

This was really good! Lots of compliments on this one! I think I'll drain the salsa next time because I went back to eat some the next day and it was a little runny. Other than that, it was great!

Asolutely wonderful!!! I made it last wekk for a "test run", my husband, my brother-in-law, and myself ended up eating the whole thing while we watched a movie.  I couldn't believe we ate the entire thing!  Seeing how it was a hit, I made it again for my husband's office pot luck dinner.  Got rave reviews there too.  I will make it again next week for our next games night.  DELICIOUS!!!!  I have already transcribed the recipe to my personal cookbook!What else can I say! I loved it!

I made this for a get togethering for my husband's friends. It was such a big hit that our friend's wife called me the next day and asked for the recipe. I did cut the amount of sourcream used 2/3 of the container and creamcheese by about half.
Will definitely make again!!

I have made this a dozen times in the last year.  After finding this recipe, I threw out all my other recipes for mexican layered dips.  I love that you can now buy taco shredded lettuce because that saves a few minutes and also gives a thinner lettuce strip.  Also we buy taco seasoning in a quart bulk container in the spice section at Costco and it is only 5 bucks so well worth it if you use taco spice very often . It tastes just like the little individual packets.  I use 2 Tablespoons for 1 -1 oz packet.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this first for my niece's graduation party. Everyone loved it! I then made it for a bridal shower, and it wasn't as much of a hit. It seems to work best at informal parties. And it's really worth the time it takes to make it!

Everywhere I take this dish, everyone always raves about it. It's really good! We make it with fresh salsa (a local company called "Garden Fresh Salsa" makes a really good salsa), but it does make it a little runny.

This recipe at the very least gave way to one of the most delicious dips I've ever had. My advice for anyone trying to make this is to just focus on the essentials: Refried beans with seasoning, salsa, and sour cream. After that, count to the rest of the way to 7 layers with any ingredients you want.

I have made this several time and also leave out the lettuce and green peppers.  My addition, add a can of Rotel tomatoes to the refried beans.  Adds a little kick and makes it easier to scoop.

Didnt find it to be that great. The sour cream/cream cheese mixture was too thick and not very appetizing. Also I will not combine the taco seasoning with the refried beans again because you could barely taste it overall.

I haven't tasted this yet but it was simple to put together. The only negative comment I can add is that it's a bit runny where the salsa and sour cream mixture meet.

I'm a taco purist as far as the veggies go, so I leave out the bell peppers and onions, but keep the tomatoes and lettuce.  Just make sure the lettuce is very finely chopped.  One thing I often do, just for ease of making it, is substitute the taco seasoning and refried beans for the hot bean dip you can buy in almost any store.  Saves a step.  I also don't necessarily heat this one up - it's just as good cold, or room temperature.  Sometimes I also add guacamole - just depends on my mood at the time.

This is a very versatile and much requested recipe.  I, too, make a few adjustments based on what I have on hand and it is always a hit.  I like it better if made a bit ahead so the flavors meld. I don't usually use lettuce or cream cheese, but no one misses them.  A handful of chopped cilantro is tasty, too.

Easy to make, and everyone loves it. The longer it sits the better. I try to give 24 hours. I have had people eating just this for 3 days straight. I also scoop out a corner, and put in a bowl so people can get to all the layers.

Love having any excuse to make this! It's always a hit and disappears fast! I used McCormick original taco seasoning which is 1.25 oz so I only used a little over half mixed in with my traditional Rosaria refried beans. Next I did the cream cheese/sour cream layer as is then I used Sabra pico de gallo salsa and used a slotted spoon so I would just get the chunky stuff and barely any juice.  I left out the lettuce since so many other people did and I just topped those three layers with a bag (2 cups) of Shredded Mexican cheese and topped that with sliced olives and green onions. Best bean dip ever!

Great recipe! The only thing I did differently was mix half of the packet of the taco seasoning in the beans. Then I mixed the other half of the taco seasoning with the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. I also added half the cheddar in with the cream cheese/sour cream and the rest on top. Either way will taste great, I just wanted to make sure everything was distributed equally for each bite!

Apparently you need to use a large serving platter. I left out the tomato, onions and green pepper since the salsa had that. I served it with scoops chips. My man loved it.

I love this recipe. I played around with it because I had more ingredients in my fridge than recipes, so I made a portion with some ground beef and guacamole. Both variations were fantastic.

Far too much cream cheese and sour cream! Never could get the softened cream cheese to blend with the sour cream, even using an electric mixer. A simple layer of 8 oz. of sour cream would have sufficed.

This is a great, basic recipe and is perfect for parties!  I made it for my family Christmas party and it got raves...it serves a lot of people, too!  I think the only thing I would do differently next time is use a hot salsa or add some sliced jalapenos (because I would like it spicier), but it's nice you can customize to your guests' tastes.  Definitely use a chunky salsa so that it holds up better and doesn't make the sour cream mixture runny.  I also tried to layer the "sturdier" ingredients, i.e. peppers, lettuce, etc. against the sour cream mix and THEN put down the salsa so that it didn't get too messy.  All in all, a keeper! Would be really pretty in a clear glass bowl, too, so you can see the layers.

The best  seven layer dip!  The lettuce gives it a great crunch.  Be sure to dry of the lettuce well and choose a salsa that is not watery.  It makes a lot of  dip, I used  a 9 x 13 inch glass dish and it filled it.  I skipped the tomatoes and used red bell peppers instead.

This recipe is a hit with my family- although I have a couple of suggestions.  Most importantly- add guacamole.  It's simply not as good without it.  Second- it's good the first day, but better the second day.  Therefore, I didn't add the lettuce.  Not so sure that would look so pretty the second or third day.  I did, however, add black beans.  
Yummy!

Though this dip looked good when I brought it to our school potluck (I garnished it with sliced black olives), once people dipped into it it looked rather mushy and the layers blended together and did not look that appetizing.  It was tasty but nothing to rave about.

There are many versions of taco dips and this one is very good.  The only tweeking I did was to use a can of black beans instead of refried beans which contain a whole bunch of salt.  I also added a few jarred jalopenos to spic it up a bit.

I made this for the first time last Christmas, omiting the olives as I don't like them. It was delicious, but have made a few minor tweeks. I don't use the lettuce as you can't dip thru it, and if it sits out for too long or by some strange reason the dip doesn't get eaten all at once and you have to put it back in the fridge, the lettuce tends to wilt and get soggy. Also like one other member said, it can be made a little healthier by using low fat sour cream, cream cheese and cheddar and low sodium taco seasoning. If i want some extra heat I add Jalapenos in place of the olives. This recipe is so versatile and you can modify it to suit your needs

Excellent recipe as is except container must be larger.  To give it an extra special kick and have folks saying, "What IS that?" I add an envelope of dry Onion Soup mix to the sour cream & cream cheese.
I also use fat free sour cream/cream cheese. Never any leftovers.  Happy summer everyone!

Loved it but tweaked it:
Nixed the salsa and the bell pepper
Used shredded romaine because it was what I had 
Mixed half the taco seasoning into the beans and the rest into the cream cheese mixtures

Made it low(er) fat by using fat free refried beans, low fat cream cheese, and low fat sour cream!

Followed this recipe to the letter except for the green bell pepper. We don't care for green bell peppers. This is by far the best dip we have ever tried.

With a few modifications I really liked this dish. Instead of refried beans I sauted half a red onion, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, 1/4 cup salsa and 16oz drained and rinsed black beans with 1/2 pkg. of taco season. I also added 1/2 cup homemade ranch dressing to the cream cheese(1/3fat) mixture and used fat free sour cream. The final addition was yellow and red bell peppers and cilantro. Great recipe!! This is a crowd pleaser!!

Great recipe, used for super bowl Sunday game.  Big hit.  Requested for another party in the future.  I would use two cans of beans instead of one next time, 9X12 dish perfect.  Omit lettuce and bell peppers.

love this recipe! although, i don't think it needs the tomatoes, considering all of the salsa it calls for. also, i don't think the green bell pepper is necessary. i took out both and added a layer of avocado, lime, garlic, salt & pepper. yummy!

This is great!  I usually make it as-is, but have altered it depending on my mood by adding hot peppers or hot sauce.  It is easy to alter based on your taste.  This is the ONLY thing I will eat olives on, too.  I normally hate olives, but for some reason, I have to have olives on this!

I added guacamole instead of lettuce since lettuce will wilt fast.  The dip was gone within the hour.  Several requests to make this now

This was GREAT! Everyone loved it. The only thing that I did differently was I got rid of the lettuce and added homemade guacamole in it's place. I also got rid of the tomatoes because the thick and chunky salsa had plenty in there. Will definately make again!

I love this dip, and my family keeps asking me to bring it to parties. I usually leave out the lettuce and use Colby and Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar. It's easy to moderate the spiciness by using hot or mild salsa and adding other spices, but my family prefers the mild version.

This recipe was really enjoyed by all of our company. I will make it again. I did not use a shallow enough dish though. A jelly roll baking dish or something with a 1 inch lip would be perfect.

I love this for a quick and easy appetizer for a big crowd. It's easy to use what you have on hand too! I prefer to mix the taco seasoning into the sour cream, minus the cream cheese, instead of mixing into the beans. Also, if expecting leftovers I recommend a light layer of salsa due to it getting a bit watery if kept a few days.The ice berg lettuce can easily be subtracted and I typically use a finely shredded mexican cheese blend, cheddar is a bit too coarse. Also a guacamole layer is a tasty addition!

Oh man! The taco seasoning mixed with the beans is such a great idea. I also love the creaminess of the cream cheese and sour cream. (Although, when I doubled this recipe, the sour cream/cream cheese amount was HUGE.)

This dip is ALWAYS a winner! Like others, I did make some modifications. One can of refried beans is not enough, you will need two (which I warmed up a bit in the microwave first to make it easier to stir)- and, I only used 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning (a full packet may overwhelm the overall taste). I also made homeade quacamole (I used five avacados for this recipe) and used in lieu of the lettuce, which I feel adds a ton of flavor. Instead of salsa, I used two cans of drained chopped tomates with green chilies (which will avoid the dip getting watery). I also left out the green pepper, which is a personal preference. I layered the beans first, the followed with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture, then the quacamole, the tomatoes, the cheese, then topped with sliced black and green olives and green onions. I have yet to meet anyone who has not loved this dip!

This is ALWAYS a hit.  I usually dice up a small white onion instead of doing the green onions.  This is always one of the first dishes to go!

Tastes great!  I have made it before using the cream cheese.  Today for Cinco de Mayo I didn't use cream cheese, and it tasted just fine.  So easy, too!

this is my favorite taco dip recipe!  I first saw it online a couple years ago and now I bring this to all potluck events I go to and everyone loves it!  Once someone else brought a taco dip and mine was gone before even 1/2 of theirs was :) FABULOUS! Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic! I made it for a morning breakfast event at work, and it was received extremely well. Even better, it was all eaten! Nice blend of smooth and spicy flavors! You can change the veggies to your taste, or to availability, and it comes out great!

I left out the green pepper & lettuce. And after mixing up the sour cream & cream cheese, I left out about half of it - it seemed like way too much. The finished product tasted really good. I'll definitely make it again.

This was pretty good. If I make it again I would double the amount of refried beans. The rest of the ingredients are enough to fill a bigger pan than the recipe calls for (which other reviewers have also noted) but you have to spread the beans real thin in that case.

Absolutely fantastic dip!  I'm glad I read some reviews of people suggesting what size dish to use - I don't see how this would fit in anything other than a 13x9.  That dish was full by the time I was done layering!  I did as others suggested and mixed the taco seasoning in with the sour cream, cream cheese mixture and the combination was just delicious.  I made this and refrigerated it overnight before serving so I left out the lettuce to avoid the wilt factor.  It wasn't missed, the other veggies are plenty.  If you're entertaining less than 6 or 7 people I'd considering halving the recipe.

Delicious! I made this for a football party and it was happily devoured. I followed some suggestions and did a home-made guacamole layer instead of the vegetable and lettuce... yum! I should have used a slightly bigger dish to serve it in... a 9x13 would probably do the trick. Thanks!

I made this for New years snacks. It was a hit! My friends loved it. I wasn't sure how the taco seasoning would taste mixed into the refried beans, but after it was all made and my friends started diggin' in, I was assured it was delicious. I will def make again for get togethers and parties.

I made this for a dinner party last week and it was a HUGE hit. I thought it had made way more than we needed but by the time dinner came around, there was only a little bit of this left!  I used 1/2 the packet of taco seasoning for the re-fried beans and the other 1/2 for the sour cream layer. I also didn't use the entire container of sour cream, only about 2/3. I omitted the tomato since the salsa seemed to be more than enough and also cut back on the lettuce and olives. I didn't have a 9x13 dish to put this in so I used a 9x9. I thought it might be too thick but people just scooped it out on to appetizer plates and devoured it :) Served with Tostito's scoops. I'm planning to make this for another party this weekend and am going to try adding in a layer of guacamole as other reviewers suggested.

Great recipe to make as an party appetizer or for a football game!  I made this for lunch today for my family and it was a big hit, even my 8 year old nephew enjoyed it.  Only changes i made: left out the bell pepper.  Added ground turkey meat (that i seasoned with half the taco seasoning) and jalapenos.  Definitely a keeper!

This was the second time I made this and the first time I don't remember it being that incredible, but I made it for a party last night and it was devoured in minutes! I think the secret is to use fresh, homemade salsa and you will have an incredible recipe!

really easy and tastes great. served it at christmas, it was the first thing to go! i also left out the lettuce and it didn't matter. i used spicy refried beans and then layered guacamole, sour cream and cream cheese mixture(with half a packet of taco seasoning), salsa, cheese and topped with green onions and tomato. the cream cheese really does add something, as someone else pointed out, so don't leave it out! the only thing i may add next time is some cilantro, but even without it it was the perfect dip!

This was pretty good. Took it to a party and it disappeared. I put it in a 7x11 dish, should have used a bigger dish. The bean:sour cream ratio seemed off, next time add another can of beans/seasoning.

I used a 9x13 pyrex dish and blended the beans with a hand mixer with half of the taco seasoning. I spread them in the dish and it looked way too thin so I added another can of beans with more seasoning. Then I did the sourcream/creamcheese/rest of the seasoning blended, guacamole, green onion, olive, tomato and then the salsa and cheese. I used medium salsa and mild seasoning and it wasn't spicy tasting. Everyone seemed to love it at my work party!

Definitely a staple in our house.  My husband LOVES this (and loves to make it since it's so simple).  It's definitely easy and delicious.  We just always forget how much this makes and don't put it in a large enough container so it ends up being layered too thick.  ooops.  Make it in a 13X9 inch dish and you'll be golden.

I made this for an important gathering. It looked beautiful, but the first few "dips", the bottom of the dish was runny with juice and dissolved refried beans. I had to take it aside and try to drain it and wipe it out with paper towel. That helped, but I won't make this dish again.

This was such a hit at our last party!  I can't believe how many people asked for the recipe!!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe read.  Next time, I think I will add a few more beans... Kept in the fridge for many days still tasting great!

We really like this dip.  My only complaint is that sometimes the salsa and tomato part can get a little runny which makes too much liquid in the container = not good for presentation.  Other than that, the taste is great.

Wonderful! Kids (plus an extra kid) ate several helpings. We added hamburger, used fresh black beans with homemade taco seasoning, and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Excellent!

I am always asked to bring this to family gatherings, everyone loves it!  It makes a TON.  I make it as is and usually put the olives on the side because certain people do not like them (including my husband!).  Get the bagged shredded lettuce called "shreds" if you can, save a lot of time.

This dip was very tasty but I think the amounts are a little off.  I used only half of the cream cheese and half of the sour cream, otherwise you hide the taste of the refried beans.  Also, I mixed the seasoning mix with the sour cream, cream cheese.  I drained the salsa because I was afraid it would get to soggy.  I also added the shredded lettuce just before serving.  Will be making this dish again.

I just made this for a graduation party and everyone LOVED it! As another reviewer suggested, I left out the green bell peppers and lettuce, and I put a layer of guacamole (Luvann's guacamole recipe from this website) on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer. I forgot to garnish with olives, but it was delicious nonetheless. I'll definitely be making this again!

I have made this before without the cream cheese and refried beans.  I think they are both equally as good, but adding the layer of beans keeps the dish from getting watery after awhile.

Always a big hit at parties.  But you simply MUST put the taco seasoning in the sour cream mix, not the refried beans.  It's the only way to do it.  :)

An easier way to make this dip is to mix the taco seasoning, sour cream, and cream cheese together and use that as your base. then add your toppings. I use onions lettuce tomatos and grated cheese. It's easier, cheaper, and still has amazing taste. Make your toppings out of what you would normally put on tacos. The best thing about this dip is that after you make the base you can put whatever you like on it.

I alwyas relied on my friend to make her 7 layer dip, but now she relies on me when i made this one and brought it to sunday pot luck! It is not stated in the recipe but it is easier to put the dip in a 9x13 dish.

I used this as a base recipe. I had never made seven layer dip before. All I did was the bean, sour cream/cream cheese, and cheddar cheese. I did all of the stuff on the side so that people could kind of create their own dip. We served it with Fritos. It was a big hit.

This was okay. I prefer a taco dip with the taco seasoning mixed into the sour cream/cream cheese. Also, I would not use so many veggies next time. I had spread this into a 13x9 inch pan and it was heaping over the top.

I have made this 4 times now and it's great! I have decided that instead of using salsa and tomatoes each as a separate layer, I bought rotel canned tomatoes with green chilis to substitute for both and it came out less runny than when I added salsa. PERFECT!

Amazing! My whole family loves it!! I usually use Taco Bell brand seasoning mix (make sure you don't get fajita or chipotle flavored seasoning mix, it's not as good!) fat-free refried beans (I'm a vegetarian and most regular refried beans have lard in them) hot chunky salsa, I use fresh chopped jalepenos instead of green bell pepper, I leave off the green onions and only put tomato in half (a lot of people in my family don't like tomato!). Instead of mixing the taco seasoning with the refried beans, I mix it in with the cream cheese and sour cream. I usually top it off with shredded "taco blend cheese" (has taco seasoning in it) instead of cheddar cheese.

This is always good and everyone always loves it however I have my own version of this recipe.  I mix the sour cream and cream chese with the taco seasoning mix packet and it is awesome like that!  I also do not use green pepper or the beans but I am going to try it like that.

I made this for a party and it was too rich.  The next time I will only use cream cheese or sour cream.  The two combined was too rich and I will have to make sure to use my largest dish the next time.

I used black re-fried beans instead b/c we love their flavor and mixed in a can of black beans for texture. I omitted the mayo - it just seemed unnecessary - didn't miss it a bit.  easy to make up the night before a party and assemble just before guest arrive.

I made a double batch because I knew a dish with one can of refried beans wasn't enough. It would have been just about right! Maybe leaving a few wanting more. I used guac vs lettuce. Put part together the night before, and finished it up in the morning. The only problem I ran into was the salsa was too watery and it flooded my refrigerator when it ran off the plate. I will strain my salsa next time. Yummm

Okay, this recipe really is perfect as-is.  I needed something for a work Halloween potluck and I struck gold with this one.  Only thing I did was to use 1.5 cans of beans instead of 1.  This way, the entire bottom of my 9x13 glass dish was covered.  Everything else was the same!  Very, very simple and easy to make.  I highly recommend using ALL ingredients on the list.  Fresh veggies really make a difference and so does the shredded lettuce.  I did the bottom 2 layers (beans/seasoning and cream cheese/sour cream) the night before and let them chill overnight.  Half an hour before the party, I then added my salsa layer, then lettuce w/ veggies, then cheese then olives...PERFECTION.  The entire dish was gone first bf all of the other dishes!  Everyone was raving about it.  I really couldn't believe the positive reaction.  HIGHLY recommend!

I've been using this recipe for the past 2 years and I loooove it! The first time I made it for four of my guy friends, they couldn't stop eating it and before the night was over the platter was clean. I always make sure to use a bit smaller of a pan so that the bean/taco and cream cheese/sour cream ratio is balanced.

I made this for a get together last weekend and everyone liked it.  I took the suggestion of others and mixed the taco seasoning, cream cheese and sour cream together.  I also took the suggestion of others and mixed some diced jalapeno peppers (from the jar) into the refried beans.  I decided not to use the bell pepper as I thought it would over power the dish.  I also didn't use the lettuce because many said it wilted fast.  Overall, I thought this was a good recipe.  However, I will make a few modifications next time ... based on my own taste buds.  I would add a little seasoning salt to the sour cream mixture or perhaps sprinkle a few drops on each layer.  The flavors tasted good together but I felt it could have definitely used more seasoning and spice.  I didn't care for the salsa as it kind of made the dish runny.

Best 7-layer dip! Next time I will add some extra beans on the bottom. (I had a pan 8x11 inch and the beans barely spread across the whole bottom.) I did add guacamole instead of lettuce and green peppers. It turned out great!

I love this recipe, but the first time I made it my salsa was too watery and soon the whole thing was swimming.  Now I use about half the salsa in a thin layer, then literally lay a paper towel over the salsa layer to gently blot the excess moisture before adding the veggies and cheese.  Now it turns out perfectly.

I accidentally bought only an 8 oz container of sour cream, but this recipe was amazing and was devoured very quickly.  It made so much I was sure there would be leftovers, but there weren't!

this dip was fantastic!  i had my doubts about mixing the taco seasoning in the beans rather than the sour cream, and the green peppers, but this was awesome! i made it for a party last night and it was a wild success, we couldn't stop eating it!

i made this for a "mexican dish" get-together this past week, and everyone raved.  I omited the grn. pepper.  I added a layer of sliced avacados (yum!), used chunky salsa (so it wouldn't get runny), i mixed 1/2 the taco seasoning with the cream cheese and 1/2 with the beans.  i made in a 9x13 dish - and it fit perfectly.  Finished the bit of left overs the next day (still delish).  my husband even used some leftovers to make a "burrito"!  very good!

Sour cream, cheese, refried beans and salsa...what's not to like???  I did, however, omit the olives and cut back on the onion but that's just per my personal taste.

We love this recipe.  The only change I make is that I put the green onions on top of the cheese. My daughter requests this as her reward for good report cards.  And in the summer, we use it as dinner on really hot days! Fantastic!

I have made this dip several times and it comes out tasting great every time! I do cut the recipe in half just to make it for around the house. I do have to say that I don't even use half of the packet of taco seasoning mix, just a few sprinkles is enough for me, I don't like it too overpowering. I also add in some store made guacamole on top of the beans, and mix the sour cream and cream cheese together as one layer. No matter how you make it, its very delicious!

This dip is amazing. I took some advice and added a pound of hamburger mixed with the taco seasoning, and I used the 13x9 pan. I made this for a party and it was gone b4 i could get any!

Easy and Yummy! I will make this again!  You can just as easily put it in a 9x13 glass casserole, which makes it a little more easy to transport somewhere.

It was good - not extraordinary.  Had to beat the cream cheese/sour cream mixture with electric beaters because it was lumpy.  Added the shredded lettuce and cheese at last minute so it didn't get sloggy.  I think it needs the lettuce.  I like spicy - could have added some jalapenos I think.

I made this for a Super Bowl party last week and I LOVED it, I added spicy sausage instead of ground meat simply because I thought it would taste better. I would have given it 5 stars, but my husband said it was just "ok".

I've made this every year for the Super Bowl for as long as I can remember with one slight change...I use homemade guacamole instead of salsa and it really adds a freshness to the dip...just a suggestion..either way, it's awesome!!

This is a very easy recipe. I basically followed it exactly except I used two packets of taco seasoning. The first one I used as the recipe states and mixed it with the refried beans. The second package I mixed in with the sour cream and cream cheese. I think it added a little more of a taco flavor. Everyone loved it and it was devoured in no time!

I only gave this 4 stars because it could be a little spicier.  But it is a very good dip and I will make it again.  I left out the lettuce, as it would wilt, left out the onions due to preference, added black beans and a can of mexicorn.  Very good dip.  Will bring to a gathering tommorrow. Much better than the rather plain, usual taco dip.

This would be best in a small casserole vs. a square pyrex because of the numerous quantity of ingredients.  Obviously, the bigger the dish, the thinner the layers and the lettuce and so on could fit.  If you go with a very large casserole, use more refried beans.

Don't bother mixing the taco seasoning in with the beans because it's far easier to use a mixer to blend the sour cream/cream cheese and taco seasoning.

I wasn't sure why you'd layer tomatoes and onions over this lg. amount of salsa but it does add a nice texture difference.

Drain the salsa a bit before spreading so it's not so watery.  

I layered bottom to top as follows: 1 Refried Beans 2 Guacamole 3 Sour cream/cream cheese/taco seasoning mixture
4 Salsa 5Chopped mixture of green onion, tomatoes, green pepper, a little bit of green chiles  6 Shredded lettuce  7 Cheese 8 Garnish black olives.

Not much that I can add to over 600 rave reviews. I made this dip for a small family gathering (9 people+kids) and it was gone except for a few scoops. me and hubby ate leftovers the next day in front of the TV and they were great. I used home-made guac instead of lettuce, and sweet corn niblets instead of green pepper. Everyone ate it up.

Loved this. I made this for a recent Christmas party and it was delicious. Plus, I have friends who are vegetarians, so this is perfect for the non-meat-eaters. 

I did omit the lettuce as I heard someone else say that it wilts. And for those who like a little kick, adding a jalapeno with the green pepper would give it some nice heat. Thanks for the recipe.

I make this alot for parties, however I change it up a little bit. I use one drained and rinsed can of black beans, mash them lightly and mix them with the can of refried beans and taco seasoning (sometimes I throw in a can of diced green chiles too). I then layer on the guacamole, then a layer of fresh pico de gallo w/ lime juice, then a layer of sour cream. Sprinkle on a light layer of shredded cheese, chopped black olives and green onions. This fit perfectly into a disposable 9x13 aluminum pan. Left out the lettuce, bell pepper and cream cheese because they sounded like odd additions to this dish.

I thought it was good and I took it to a party and it was gone really quick.  However I thought the taco seasoning was too strong in the beans and would either use 1/2 a packet or two cans of beans which ever is easier.

This is way better than any other seven layer dip I've ever had.  We couldn't stop eating it!  I did leave out the lettuce - was afraid it would get mushy if it sat overnight.  I also used fat free refried beans, lowfat sour cream, and reduced fat cream cheese without a problem.  Next time, I'll try adding guacamole to it.  Yummy!

This was so awesome! I bought green onion for this specifically, but in a rush grabbed a sweet onoin. It was great. Also added black beans on top of the sourcream layer. It was awesome, got rave reviews and now I make it all the time. THANKS!

Brought this to a taco pot luck and it was awesome! I did add some guacamole to it because I love avacados. I got sooo many compliments on this dip.  It was the only dish that was completely gone, people actually faught over the last spoonful.

Made this for a cookout and everyone absolutely raved about it.  I did make a couple of changes.  I omitted the lettuce and bell pepper.  In place of this, I made a faux guacamole.  I had avacado on hand, but no cilantro, lime juice or onion.  So I mashed up the avacado with a couple tablespoons of mayo, pinch of salt and pepper, splash of red wine vinegar to give it a bit of acidity and a dash of cumin and used a couple of the diced tomatoes for the top layer.  Tasted great!  Also, instead of adding the taco seasoning to the beans, I browned up some ground beef and added it to that.  Lastly, to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture I minced up some pickled jalapenos and mixed that in for an added kick.  I layered mine as follows:

Beans
Cream Cheese/Sour Cream 
Ground beef
Guacamole
Shredded cheese
Tomatoes
Olives

Will definitely make again.  Most likely for Sunday football games!

Kids LOVE THIS!  I took it to a neighborhood party last night and served it with Fritos Scoops....everyone loved it.  I skipped the lettuce because wilty lettuce is gross, and I added a large pinch of chopped cilantro to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Also used Chihuahua cheese on top because I had it on hand....yum!

I made this for my son's 3rd birthday party this past weekend(for the adults) and I didn't even get to try it. I changed a couple of things, because I had it on hand. I used 2 cans of bean dip instead of the plain refried beans. Because of the bean dip, I just mixed the taco seasoning with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. I was so busy with the party, but the guests said that it was  really good. My husband said that the salsa was kind of watery. So, make sure that you drain it a little or get chunky salsa so that it won't be runny. Thanks for the recipe, and hopefully I'll get to try it next time I make it.

Well, this didn't blow my socks off, but it's still a very good recipe. I added in an easy guacamole and omitted the peppers from the recipe (personal preference). 

It turned out good, but the bean layer was a bit too salty for me. It was partly my mistake (I used 1.5 oz instead of just 1 oz of taco seasoning), but next time I make this, I'll only use 0.5 to 0.75oz of taco seasoning. One can of beans just can't stand up to that much taco seasoning, in my opinion.

I put this on a large platter when serving.  I do not use lettuce or green peppers.  I do add cooked ground beef to the beans and I add the taco seasoning mix to the sour cream mixture.  I layer in the following order..beans, guacamole, sour cream mixture, cheese, tomatoes, green onions, black olives.  Great served with Frito Scoops.

This was good. I made it and took it to a party. Next time, I may add some seasoned ground beef as a layer on top of the beans and not as much lettuce. Everyone liked it.

Very Delicious, but I didn't have the green peppers or sour cream / cream cheese .  I added ground beef and sauteed onion, and guacamoke. I also used a MSG-free taco seasoning mix that I made myself from a recipe on this site.  I will be making this again.

This was delicious although I did alter it a little.  I bought refried beans that were already seasoned, "Zesty", and mixed the taco seasoning with the sour cream and cream cheese. I used a jar of salsa but I think next time I will buy taco sauce instead but none the less... Gone in just a few minutes!

WOW this dip was amazing..and somewhat HEALTHY as well... I used fat free refried beans, low fat cream cheese, light sour cream, and multigrain tortilla chips to lessen up the calories! I first layed down the bean mixture, then the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Then I topped that with some homemade guacamole (avacado is VERY good for you!) I then put the salsa on top of that and topped off with the tomoatos, green onions, green peppers(extra veggies), then the cheese and olives....everyone at our football party absolutly LOVED this dish. I would recommend it to anyone!

I followed the recipe exactly, and brought it to a Christmas party.  Much to my surprise, a friend made the same thing!  However, her's was only the sour cream, salsa, and cheese layers.  I liked her's better.  I found that mine got a bit soggy from the tomato, and the lettuce wilted, even though I made it only an hour before the party, with ingredients I had bought that day.

Very tasty, pretty easy too. I didn't use olives (I'm not a fan), and I was afraid that I wouldn't have enough beans to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan. As a result, I used a 7x11 pan, and I ended up having about 1/2 cup of leftover cream cheese/sour cream mixture. I'll make this again; it was a hit at the Christmas party!

One of the best taco dips I ever made. I modified it slightly and made my first layer with the refried beans and 1/2 of the taco mix, I then make the cream cheese sour cream layer and mixed in the remaining taco mix. I skipped the lettuce and green pepper and added a layer of hot jalapeno's as a topping! It was gone in minutes.

I made this for football sunday over at my in laws a few months ago and it was quite good. I didnt change a thing however next time I would cut the recipe in half as it was ALOT even for 7 1/2(a 1 1/2 year old) people. I didnt look at to serving size it made so my fault.

I didn't use the chopped tomato, green bell pepper, chopped green onions, or small head iceberg lettuce. I made "LuvAnn's guacamole" and this is how I layered it: refried beans, cream cheese/ sour cream, good quality salsa, guacamole, shredded cheese, olives. GREAT recipe! Took it to a BBQ-- the dish was finished within 20 minutes, and everyone loved it!

Great flavor but a bit too heavy for me.  Will make again but would like to try using half the cream cheese and half the sour cream and replace amounts with yogurt.

Everyone always loves this taco dip! I've never had any left overs but plenty of rave reviews. The only change I made was to add 1 lb of ground beef between the beans and the cream cheese blend to give it (even more!) substance.

I've used this recipe for many football parties. It is an absolute hit! The only thing I do differently is add an extra layer of guacamole between the sour cream and the salsa layer. Plus lots of extra cheese, you can never have enough cheese. Yummy.

I made the whole thing and then noticed the unopened jar of salsa still sitting in the pantry. Oops. It was delicious even without it!

yummy...i do think next time i will skip the lettuce though.  i did add guacamole and used diced black olives on the top.  i ended up putting it in a trifle bowl like the picture shows-it was a pretty presentation, but i think next time i will put it on a large platter for easier scooping:)  rave reviews by everyone that tried it.

Fantastic! What's not to love?? Lots of yummy ingredients layered up all tempting and pretty! This is wonderful with tortilla chips but works well with toasted pita bread points too! The only change I made was to add a layer of guacamole on top of the refried bean mixture. This tasty treat is guaranteed to disappear quickly at any function!

I made this salad for an office party for Cinco de Mayo and it got rave reviews.  Instead of adding the taco seasoning to the beans I added it to the sour cream/cheese cream mixture and I think that was much much better.  I omitted the onions as well.  I also drained the salsa just a little bit so the salad wouldn't be so watery as someone else suggested.

The only thing I changed was using "chive and onion" cream cheese.  Brought this to a party and the guests all raved about it.  My husband thought it needed "more beans and less sour cream" so maybe next time I'll double the beans, but I thought it was perfect the way it was.

My guests loved this when I served it at a recent party. I served it with corn chip scoops. I used two cans of fat free refried beans instead of the recommended one can, but didn't need to double anything else. I also added in a layer of guacamole before the salsa layer (remember to lightly drain the salsa before adding to prevent a watery dish). I used pre-packaged lettuce shreds and left off the green onions and green peppers. The finely shredded cheddar cheese works the best for me. It made a 9x13 pan when made for 56 servings. I would make it again.

LOVED IT! This was the first time I've made 7 layer dip, and was better than any other i've had. I made just a few changes that were recommended in other reviews: added a layer of guacamole over the beans and mixed the taco seasoning in sour cream/cream cheese mix instead of beans. Wonderful! I can't wait to make it again.

Also, I made it in a 9x13 pan and had to use a second can of beans.

Perfect for me, but some of my guests didn't like it as much as other 7 layer dips because there was no guacamole.

This was great!  I left off the olives and onions, but it still tasted very good.  I didn't soften the cream cheese enough so it was a bit lumpy when i mixed it with the sour cream. Next time I'll use a long platter as well, since it did get a little high, as noted by another reviewer.  But i'd definitely make this again!

I used a spicy bean dip instead of the refried beans and taco mix. I also added gucamole on top of the sourcream/cream cheese mix. I also added colored peppers to the chopped tomatoes. Took this to Thanksgiving and it was a big hit with the family.

I left out the lettuce since I was making this for overnight, and I'm still convinced that was a good call.  I thought the taco seasoning mix made things too salty.  I might make this again, but will leave out the taco mix and lettuce.  Just needs some tweaking.

I first tasted this dip years ago at a Bingo party.......it is outstanding!  I used a 13x9" glass pan for a lovely presentation.  I noticed that lots of people think the taco seasoning is too salty......Old El Paso makes a reduced sodium one that is really great.  I am thinking of using Green Giant Mexicorn (if it is still being made)instead of another member's idea of making a corn layer.  I like the idea of black beans on top, instead of olives, since not everybody likes olives.  This dip is too yummy!

This was definitely good, and I made it for a Christmas gathering, a time of year that our family is accustomed to having Mexican food. It made a gorgeous presentation. However, there are a few men in the family who don't like green pepper, so I omitted that. Plus, the taco seasoning kind of gives the beans a strange after-taste. It might just be me, but my sisters said that they always left off the taco seasoning as well. Sometimes we add ground beef to it just after the cheese layer if we want to make it more of a meal. Another plus is to get some takeout refried beans from a Mexican restaurant to put in it--somehow they just make it better, if I can remember to do that during all the hustle and bustle of the shopping, etc. But it is a beautiful dip and makes a gorgeous presentation. I like to serve it in a large, round bowl that has straight sides, almost like a trifle serving dish. I found something very festive at a local discount chain that was partly transparent so the guests could see the different layers through the sides. Beautiful!

Very good dip!  Everybody devoured this at my daughter's b-day party.  I changed it a little - I put half the taco seasoning in the refried beans and the other half in the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  I also left off the lettuce because I was afraid it would get soggy.  Delicious!!!

I think this is a great recipe, you can adjust it many ways to suit your own tastes.  I omitted the shredded lettuce and tomatoes when I made this.  ALL of it was eaten!!!  It is addictive.  It is very mild though.  Next time I would use medium salsa, or jalapenos, or some hot sauce to liven it up a bit.

This dip is really good.  I browned up a lb of hamburger and put the taco seasoning whith the hamburger and put it right on top of the sour cream.  I added a can of green chlies with the refried beans.  I forgot the lettuce.  That's exactaly how I did it, but there is a lot of room to change this recipe to taste.  It's a great recipe.

This was very good!! I added an extra can of refried bean still only using 1 package of taco seasoning next time I will use 2.  Didnt have bell pepper so didn't use it. I used my spicy homemade salsa which has lots of tomatoes in it so ommited tomatoes.  It was very good.  Served it with Chicken Tortilla Soup 1 and a large bag of chips served it at my Texas Holdem poker nite..  Everyone enjoyed!!!!!

Word of Advice:  Make this in advance and refrigerate.  It is much better the next day when the flavors have a chance to meld.  The first day the taco seasoning was overwhelming, then everything rehydrated and blended nicely.

I love this recipe, sometimes I make it with all fat free ingredients, but it tastes better with full fat.  I also use whipped cream cheese, i think it blends together better.

Really good! I halved the recipe, used 1 1/2 tbsps of Taco Seasoning Mix from this site. Left out olives 'cause I hate him, substituted green chiles for green pepper, and didn't add tomato because I didn't have it (was plenty tomatoey with the salsa anyway). Will definitely make next time I have to bring a dip to a party. Thanks!

This recipe is great!  However, I add the taco seasoning to the sour cream and cream cheese mixture (and I leave the lettuce out too). This is a definite croud pleaser!

This was excellent!  My family loved it after our Christmas dinner, just to snack on while playing games.  The one thing I would do next time, is reduce the amount of taco seasoning.  I thought it was a little over-powering.

Very yummy!  It was easy to make, just I hate having to cut up veggies. :)  I'd definitely make it again, but to cut down my prep time get chopped tomatoes from a can and pre-shredded lettuce. I think next time I'd leave out the diced tomatos and just have the salsa be the tomato part.  I'm not much of a tomato fan, plus it makes the dip less watery.

I wish I could give this one 10 stars!  My fiance and I have made it several times to bring to parties, and have always come away with more compliments on it than anything else we have made.  The only changes we made was to mix some of the seasoning with the refried beans AND with the sour cream (we omitted the cream cheese).  It is a little soupy, but using the chips that look like scoops really helps.

THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT RECIPIE!

I removed the bell pepper, replaced the lettuce with Guacamole and put the taco seasoning on a pound of ground beef. 

I layered it bottom first as follows:

Beans
Sour Cream/Cream Cheese mix
Taco Seasoned Ground Beef
Salsa
Guacamole
Tomatoes
Cheese 
Green Onions and Black Olives on top.

I actually made it the night before to let the flavors sit in a little and it was awesome. More filling than you would think.

I made this recipe in lieu of buying a dip for an anniversary party.  I doubled the batch and did it on a 16" square heavy duty plastic tray... good idea on the heavy duty LOL.  I bought the restaurant-style refried beans and mixed with taco seasoning.  Then a layer of the cream cheese/sour cream, topped with cooked taco meat, then chunky salsa that I had drained, then olives, green onions, and cheese.  I knew it would be sitting out so I opted out of lettuce and thought that if I did salsa AND tomatoes, that would be a bit overkill.  I had the taco meat to use, that's why I threw it in.  I know, don't rate it if you didn't make it exactly like the recipe and I completely agree.  In this case though, I went searching specifically for this recipe knowing what ingredients I had and was going to use, and this dip was gone by the end of the evening.

Great! I used a yellow pepper instead of a green one and omitted the iceberg lettuce. Also added a nice layer of green chiles before the salsa step which gave it a nice kick! Pickled jalapeños could be added too depending on how much you like heat! Love that it’s meatless. It’s a great party food for vegetarians who might not have another option.

Don't use a platter. Use something with a lip or sides to it. The weight and moisture of the other ingredients will displace the rest of the bottom layers and push your food over the edge of a platter.

I made this for our Superbowl Party this year and everyone LOVED this dip! I had no leftovers. I received so many compliments I'm bringing it to work today for our Easter Dinner.. I do add 1lb of hamburger  with the refried beans and taco seasoning. It's more filling and gives more flavor and also, serves perfect in a 13×9 dish.

Turned out great! It is a HUGE amount of dip, so keep that in mind if you aren’t serving a large group. The only thing I did differently was to rearrange the layers because I like the aesthetic look of the tomatoes and peppers on top as opposed to inside. This is my second time making it in 2 weeks, and I’ll probably make it again for the next football game.

What a great party appetizer!  Everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes to the recipe. I'm not a fan of black olives, so I garnished with festive tortilla strips.  I also combined monterey jack and cheddar cheese.  I left out the green peppers since I felt the other ingredients stood on their own.

I made this for a family party and eveyone loved it!  Will definitely be making it again. I did make a few changes: omitted the green onion, green pepper, & olives. Ised 3/4 of the taco seasoning with the beans, and mixed the remaining 1/4 taco seasoning with the cream cheese & sour cream mixture. I also used shredded taco cheese (which is very finely shredded & seasoned).

Always a winner at parties, but I did not bother with the cream cheese due to the calories.  I would love to try it with my homemade refried beans sometime, however using canned beans makes this a recipe for which you can pretty much always have the ingredients on hand.  I also omit the green peppers, but that is a personal preference.

It is very good, but if you want it to not be runny, you should drain the salsa a bit before adding it.

This really is a terrific recipe. It makes a boatload, so if you're serving it just for a family gathering of 20 people or less, I would suggest cutting everything in half.

I have made this taco dip several times now, and it is the envy of every party i go to. last time i made this i had to make two just to satisfy everyone. can't go wrong with this. i switched the cream cheese to mayonnaise.

 i don't use salsa. i make my own pico de gayo, with cilantro, onions, balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, green onion, and green peppers. This gives it a way better flavor!

i also don't use black olives (personal preference) or lettuce since the pico de gayo has plenty of green with the cilantro, green peppers, and green onions

This was yummy! I did make a few changes though. Instead of refried beans and taco mix, I used black beans (2 cans), drained and cooked with onions, garlic, etc (google recipe online). I also mashed up 2 small avocados with lime juice and added it on top of the sour cream, which I halved. I also halved the salsa because I only had half a jar. I instead of iceberg, I used spinach lettuce (because it was what I had on hand. Turned out great!

I did things a little different. One, I spread the beans in the dish, blended the taco seasoning into the cream cheese/sour cream mixture, then put it on top of the beans. I then put salsa, and then guacamole which had jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cayenne, and lime juice already in it; and then cheese, and then lettuce. It looks beautiful, and we all loved it!

Wonderful!  I made it vegan by using vegetarian refried beans (adding a little olive oil for smoothness); Tofutti versions of sour cream and cream cheese; I added a layer of guacamole, and topped it with shredded soy cheese.  I don't think any non-vegan would know the difference in this mix.  Delicious.  Served with blue corn tortilla chips!

Made this for a dinner party and it was really tasty and well liked.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five was a lot of liquid pooled in the container that I had to dump out.  Possibly it was from the salsa and I need a chunkier salsa.  Not sure but other than that it was a hit and will make again.

Loved it and was a hit at our family BBQ! Did turn a little watery as it set but still didn't stop people from eating it. I did follow some other reviewer's suggestions. Heated the beans slightly so it'll mix better with the seasoning, Left out the green pepper and onions. Used a can of rotel in place of the tomatoes. All in all is was a quick and easy dip and so happy I made it!

I tried this recipe on my family before making it for a potluck at work. Everyone at home loved it. I woke the next morning and there was a small corner left. Decided that I would certainly make it for the potluck for work. I change the ingredients slightly. First I used less sour cream than called for (did not realize that until the following day). I also used taco sauce instead of salsa. Then I added everything else the recipe called for plus some red onions. This recipe turned out fabulous!

OK.  I do not put taco seasoning in the sour cream.  No need with all the other natural flavors.  Besides all taco seasoning I've ever used has an artificial taste.  Use other spices if you need to.  Also, this tastes great with Monterrey Jack cheese instead of cheddar.  And you don't need more tomatoes (although I love lots of tomatoes) if you do as one reviewer said and drain the chunky salsa.  Lots of ways to do 5 or 6 or 7 or more layered dip.  And I'm sure everyone has her/his favorite.

Over the years I have made this recipe and it has evolved into an AMAZING one. I use low-fat sour cream and cream cheese, as well as fat free refried beans that are seasoned with a mix of spices, but not taco seasoning. I have done that and it works fine though. I do not put in olives or lettuce, but sometimes add a guacamole layer. If I have green onions, they go in, but I usually just use red onions. I always add some jalapenos over the cheese, and I usually use a reduced fat Mexican cheese blend from the cheese aisle. Nobody ever suspects it's all low fat, and it's ALWAYS gone quickly!

I use Chili Sauce instead of salsa due to the watery look that the salsa can leave...this makes it tangy and much easier to scoop.

Wonderful!  I prepared each of the layer ingredients ahead of time and assembled it when I got there.  Made this for a family gathering last week.  Not a bit was leftover!  Had calls for the recipe before I got back home. The only change we made was we used our own homemade salsa, drained slightly.  We had a wide range of ages of family there and they all liked it.

Made exactly as recipe but without onions and green peppers. Came out really good, but seemed a little watery, not sure if its because i used too much sour cream or because maybe I should've drained salsa, it was a little watery. But will make again, everyone finished it :P

I made this for a superbowl party. It was so good! I ate the leftovers as a meal. The only thing I added was a few dabs of hot sauce and that gave just the right kick. I didn't put in any olives as I don't care for them. The next time I make it I think I will use a smaller tomato and a larger red pepper. Even if you're a meat lover like me, this dip doesn't need any. Try this recipe.

this recipe was absolutely amazing!!! i took it to a super bowl party and the dish was cleared out so fast (scraped clean). and every single person that tried it complimented me! in fact they were raving about it all night! 
i made my own guacamole as a layer and i added a bit of salsa to the refried beans to make them more dipable.  i skipped the lettuce. i topped the dish with shredded cheese and sprinkled with the chopped green peppers and olives, it made a very nice presentation!

Delish! I generally omit the lettuce as it wilts. Ive made it hot without adding guacamole or cold adding in the guac, its yummy either way and its literally gone in minutes. I do saute ground beef with half taco seasonings and mix with refried beans and add other half of taco seasoning to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. You cant go wrong with this dip. Thank you for sharing!

I will def make this again!  I made this for a 4th of July party. I omitted the lettuce though because I was afraid it would get too soggy, instead, I made a batch of cole slaw. I chopped the cabbage up fairly small and used just a store bought dressing. I layered that on in place of the lettuce. It stayed crunchy from the first scoop to the last! Everyone loved it...including my kids, which normally would never have even ate it before.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I too did not use lettuce as I knew there would be leftovers...only 6 of us eating. I don't think green peppers fit here so didn't use them either.  I used freshly made salsa's (one roasted and one a pico type) and refried black beans w/jalapenos.  Incredible!  Oh, made beef tacos the next night.  Put this dip on the corn tortilla (heated for 20seconds) then the beef and topped w/salsa....AWESOMENESS:-)  Oops, forgot..gotta add guac, this is a must to give the dip a little more umph!!

Delicious!  I took this to a BBQ & served it w/ Tostitos Scoops.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I omitted the peppers & onions & added a layer of guacamole between the sour cream-cream cheese and salsa layers.  I make my own taco seasoning, so I added 1.5 Tbsp to the refried beans and 1.5 Tbsp to the sour cream-cream cheese.  This was super quick & easy to make.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe.  Made some adjustments.  I added a lb. of bulk sausage that I cooked with the taco seasoning and the refried beans and used that as my 1st layer.  I omitted the lettuce all together and added a layer of guacamole on top of the cream cheese layer.  Also instead of chopping tomato I used a can of tomatoes flavored w/garlic and onion that I drained really well.

SOOOOO Good! Made a small 8"x 8" pan and used the rest to make a smaller one for my kids to eat for dinner with corn tortillas. I just used regular sour cream and added corn as a layer.

This was the best taco dip I have ever made. Since many reviews said that the dip was runny, I cut down the amount of sour cream by half and drained chunky salsa. I also used jalapeno instead of green pepper and left out olives since I do not like them.

I use 2 packs of taco seasoning and mix it with the cream cheese and sour cream rather than with the beans.  I leave out the olives.  It is outstanding and a quick favorite!!

I say four stars as is and five stars when prepared like this: increase to 2 cans of beans with 2 packs of taco seasoning. Omit the green bell pepper (just doesn't fit) and lettuce (it wilts too fast). Six ounces, drained weight, of black olives is WAY too many. I'd say that 2 1/4 ounces drained is plenty...and I love olives. Made like this I'd say it's perfect.

Wonderful!  I did omit the green bell pepper also and I added a layer of guacamole on top of the sour cream mixture.  Everyone loved it!

This was good but it makes A TON of dip. If you're setting this out for a small group with other appetizers, this is way too much dip. It's essentially a casserole in a 9x13. You could cut the recipe in half and have plenty. I added a pound of browned ground beef and wouldn't dispense with it. I also baked mine with lots of Mexican blend cheese on top. I can't imagine this would be as satisfying cold. I didn't use salsa-- just a can of Rotel tomatoes with peppers, undrained. I didn't use lettuce either. I added black beans. Maybe having small bowls of con queso, guacamole & taco sauce on the side for serving with this dip would work. Decent dip recipe.

People love this dip.  Funny story:  A friend brought this to my mom's memorial service, and when we were eating the leftovers at home later that night, both my son and my significant other thought it was a casserole -- they were eating it with forks!

we loved this! we used a 9x13 pan, and it was the perfect size.. we were skeptical because we dont like refried beans, but we liked them in this recipe! we did leave out the tomatoes, green peppers, and olives, and it was still delicious! though next time, i will try and drain my salsa a bit because this got watery after it sat in the fridge for a while. between me and two other people, we ate almost the entire pan of this in one day!

Good recipe but didn't listen to other reviewers and followed the recipe but whole package of taco seasoning is too much!  I love taco seasoning so much I could probably eat it with a spoon, but in this recipe it overwhelms all the other flavors.  Next time will use half pack.  Also added guac to mine, in this order from bottom: bean/taco season; guac, cream cheese/sour cream; chunky salsa (drained); lettuce; cheese.  Skipped the green peppers and onions as wasn't sure if my guests liked them, but will add for myself next time.  I used shredded iceberg lettuce and it held up perfectly, even the next day still looked crisp & fresh.

Easy to prepare (20 minutes) and yummy.  Made a 5-layer variation (bottom to top): 1 14-oz can low sodium baked beans, mixture of 16-oz low-fat sour cream + 8-oz low-fat cream cheese + 3/4 package taco mix, 3 diced fresh tomatoes, 1 small jar medium-spicy salsa, lots of shredded mozza and cheddar cheese.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes, and it was so good.  Everyone loved it - great with multi-grain nacho chips!

This was great. My wife said it was the best she ever had. I made the recipe almost exact except I browned some meat and put the taco seasoning in with the meat. It was a huge hit and went fast. I used a 9 x 13 baking dish and that barely was enough room. Just enough actually. 

Well done.

really easy to make! My favorite seven layer dip by far and our guests loved it. I skipped the black olives since I'm not a fan and will next time get a flavored refried beans. Definitely great for parties!

This was pretty good. It made a lot (2 dishes for me), which was perfect, but ended up being a little runny for my tastes. That might come down to what kind of salsa you use, so if you have a runnier salsa, you might want to drain it a bit first, or pare back to half the amount.

Good recipe..I changed a few things to my taste.  I mixed refried beans and hamburger together with a packet and a half of taco seasoning.  Then I layered the meat mixture, sour cream, lettuce, olives, a can of RoTel tomoates and cilantro, cheese, and green onions.  Then I drizzled taco sauce on top. It was a big hit at the New Year's Eve Party!!!

Definite crowd pleaser with the recipe as is! For variation, I have added cilantro garnish and have also used ranchero refried beans instead of mixing refried beans with taco mix.

I made this dip and it was a hit at a family meeting. I made triple the recipe and it was none left after the meeting.  The layers I made was : Refried Beans with taco seasoning Ground Turkey with taco seasoning Cream Cheese/Sour Cream Shredded Cheese Guacamole from scratch Salsa from scratch Lettuce Shredded cheese again Black Olives  Will definitely make again.

I make a variation of this taco dip all the time.  I went off the recipe the first time, but now, I kind of add/subtract layers each time, but I always get complimented on how good it is!

I did not use the green peppers (I just don't like them) or the lettuce.  I did make the guacamole from this site and added that.  Excellent.

Excellent guide for seven layer dip.  As always, I made several changes.  I started with vegetarian refried beans.  Then added a fat free sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Layer 3 was 2 pureed avocados.  Layer 4 was 3 large chopped tomatoes.  Layer 5 was chopped chili and jalapeno peppers and 1/2 large yellow onion.  Layer 6 was torn up iceburg lettuce.  And finally, layer 7 was shredded pepper jack cheese.  The dip was a big hit at a recent BBQ!

Great stuff and quick to prepare for a party.  I had no leftovers.  Tips:  traditional beans (w/ lard), lightened up sour cream and cream cheese (used Neufchatel), allrecipes taco seasoning ( 1 1/2 tablespoons), Kroger premium lime salsa, no olives.  Lettuce and peppers were not critical, but they lighten up all the protein.  I went light on cheese and lettuce.  I used a round casserole, which was easy to transport, but 11x17 or two smaller flat pans  would have been more "dipping friendly".  Save some scallions to garnish top if you don't use olives.

This is one of my favorite apps to make. I've been making it for years and have tweaked it just a little bit. Instead of using the package taco seasoning I use the homemade version found on this website. I don't use green peppers but instead add guacamole as a layer. I keep everything else the same. This is so easy and yummy, thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!!!!!   I added a can of black beans to the layers, added chopped red onion along with the green onions,  added jalapeños from my garden.  I like the dip with a little kick to it.  Will defiitely make it again.

I had hosted a dinner party and served this as a appetizer. Everyone really enjoyed it! I can't wait for the next gathering, so I can make it again. It has a wonderful presentation to it. I did how ever subtract out the green bell peppers and went easy on the green onions because the salsa I used had good size chunks of them already in it. But I did garnish the top with strips of the green bell peppers along with the blk olives.

This was a great recipe and it was tasty but I felt as though there was something missing. I will certainly make it again but I may add guacamole/avacado next time. Thanks for sharing!

I changed this up a bit as my husband is allergic to cream cheese (weird, I know!). I replaced the cream cheese with drained cottage cheese. I processed the cottage cheese and the sour cream together till smooth and continued with the recipe as usual. It was a HUGE hit and my hubby was able to enjoy it too! Next time though, I am going to try ricotta instead (the cottage cheese was still a bit too runny for my liking) or an actual cream cheese substitute. Also, I am going to use two cans of refried beans on the bottom layer as I didn't find it thick enough with just one. Be sure to use a 9x13 pan, this recipe makes a lot of delicious dip!! Thanks, Sue!

I make this dip often when I am having guests over. If you don't have all of the ingredients or want to add some of your own, it is very versatile and always tastes great. I used light cream cheese and light sour cream. The refried beans make this dip extra tasty!

Amazing....lol...this is so very good! I did use fat free refried beans which I mixed half of the taco seasoning packet into....I mixed the other half of the seasoning packet with the cream cheese and sour cream....which was also low fat. Made this in a glass pie plate....everyone loved it ...served with tortilla chips. Delicious and thanks!

This is a staple at every party or get-together my family has. I usually just make it as is, sometimes subbing salsa verde for the regular salsa,  but sometimes I'll add a layer of taco meat or guacamole or both (which then adds extra layers, lol). This is so simple and delicious and always a crowd pleaser! :)

The last time I made this for a party it was gone before I could get a taste myself. A layer of guacamole makes it extra tasty. Love this dip!

This is delicious!  The leftovers are even good.  I appreciated the suggestion of draining off some of the liquid from the salsa.  This keeps the leftovers from being runny.

I made my own black bean dip- 2 cans of black beans for the bottom. I forgot to buy Green Peppers. It still came out good. I put it on a large round glass platter. A good trick I learned was to take 5 or 6 papers towels , still attached and fold them up to make a band. Wrap that around the edge if you are refrigerating overnight. The first time I made it juices ran out all over my fridge. This time I came up with the band and there was no mess.

Next time I might add more refried beans. I have made it on a pizza pan but made it in a 9x13 pan and felt the bean layer was too thin.

This dip is fantastic. I added some cilantro and left out the green pepper since I did not have any. This is a real crowd pleaser.

Really good, I've made this many times but just never reviewed.  I usually put some smashed avocado between the layers and I skip the olives and green pepper just for personal taste.  The dip is really good and surprisingly lasts a couple days in the refrigerator, although the lettuce layer is a little soggy the bottom is still really delicious!!!!!!!!!!

This dip was fantastic.  I used two cans of refried beans though instead of one.  It made a lot of dip; I filled up a large casserole dish.  A great dip to bring to parties, easy to make.  My husband took dip to work and everyone said they had to make sure they invited us to all of their upcoming parties.     Thanks for sharing Sue!

Eh.  It was good, but I think I've had (and made) better, simpler versions of the 7-layer dip.  Usually with less layers. Maybe it was the cream cheese, but something killed the "zip" I tried to get by using HOT salsa.  It was a good experiment though.

The sour cream/cream cheese combo are delicious together and the refried beans are very flavorful with the seasoning. I've made this before and was called yesterday to bring it to another family function.  I left out the green peppers just because I don't like them raw, but otherwise made just to recipe.  It does make a lot though, enough to feed 8-10 people as an appetizer.  Using a 9x13 pan will give you 1/2 in. deep dip.  I use an 8x10 and its nice and thick.

This was very good I did mine a bit diffrent. I used a 9x13 pan.Left out green pepper, added plain mashed avacado layer,a taco sauce layer & I did about 3/4c sour cream with 1/2 bar of cream cheese mixed with the taco season & used a can of rotel diced tomatoes & green chilis(drained) in place of salsa since I added about 1/4c picante sauce directly in the beans to make them smooth I also used double the beans this called for I think was 30oz can. & I did top it with lettuce I would not leave it out I used the ready shred lettuce & it did not wilt & was still good the next day.So mine went bean mixture,avacado,sour cream mixture,taco sauce,rotel tomato green chilis,cheese, lettuce,olives,green onions.Delicious I will make it again!!! Best served at room temperature I think!:)

Absolutely amazing! I made mine almost completely fat free by using fat free refried beans, sour cream, and cream cheese, and cutting back on the cheddar cheese. I also omitted the green pepper and tomato, and added lots more olives; used pace chunky hot salsa and added minced jalapenos for an extra kick. Will make again and again!

DH loved this (me too)!  I also used LuvAnn's Guacamole recipe as a layer, didn't have canned black olives.  Also used Ducal brand refried black beans.  Sinful, but Oh So Smoooooth! i pick up a couple of cans when visit the Latino market.

Using romaine lettuce instead of iceberg means a little more flavor and crunch- lettuce doesn't wilt and become soggy like iceberg has a tendency too. Adding the taco spice to the beans instead of the sour cream is the difference in this dip. Great if you like the flavor of a dollop of sour cream on your taco. Brought this to a Super Bowl party and the plate was practically licked clean! Great!

This was a big hit. However, I love my food (especially Mexican) extra spicy, so I opted for hot taco seasoning and hot salsa. I also added two cans of green chiles into the salsa layer. Instead of the refried beans I used black beans mixed with corn... it was excellent!

Easy and very tastey.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added an eighth layer of guacomole on top of the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Will definately make again.

I like the idea but really don't like peppers, bean dip & cream cheese so I changed it a bit. Browned 1lb of ground beef, added taco seasonings to the beef, layered beef, sour cream, salsa, shredded  taco cheese, lettuce, fresh chopped tomato & topped with cheese,sliced black olives and drizzled more salsa. Super Yummy, went fast!!  Thanks for the taco dip!!

great! i really liked that the beans were incorporated into this recipe. I am partial vegetarian and it provided a great source of protein. Don't get me wrong, the dish was well enjoyed by the carnivores too :) I really like the recipe for its versatility....you can swap out the ingredients that you don't like, and add those that you prefer. I did scoop out the tomatoes to decrease the amount of water so it wouldn't get soggy.

I think what I love best about this recipe is how many variations you can do with it and its still great! A recipe that allows for you to trade in and out ingredients to meet the needs of your family and guests is a true winner!

Excellent recipe! We added the taco seasoning to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture instead of the beans. Also, instead of adding salsa, we added chopped cilantro to the tomato/green pepper mixture. When counting the layers on the end, we realized that we'd forgotten the cheese layer. It certainly was not missed! We made a double recipe and both pans were empty by the end of the night! Thanks, Sue, for the great recipe!

Make it according to the recipe.  The second time I made this (I have made it several times now) I tried it with the guacamole layer as someone suggested and the flavors did not blend properly for me.

Wow!! This dip is amazing. I forgot to get the cream cheese and was not sure how it was going to taste, but even without that it was a hit! People (including me) could not stop eating this. Thank you for the recipe. I will definetly be making this again.

One of the very few recipes I follow to a tee. Very good for parties and super easy.  Do yourself a big favor though and use good, fresh salsa. I also use refried blacks beans from a nutrition standpoint. Make sure the cream cheese is super soft or it won't blend. Hard to get this into the car for a party without eating it.

Next time I make this I will mix salsa with guacamole and put on instead of the tomatoes.  Mixing them together should keep it from getting so wet.  I would also not add the peppers or lettuce, as if there is left over, the lettuce becomes limp and soggy.  Overall, I liked this, and will make it again.  Thank you.

I actually mix the taco seasoning with the cream cheese and put that on bottom, then rinsed black beans simmered in chili powder & cumin on top of that.

This was fantastic!  I made as directed except I did add 1-2 spoonfuls of the salsa to the beans to thin them out for easier dipping(as suggested by another reviewer.)  I also didn't use fresh tomatoes because they looked pitiful at my store.  I used red bell pepper instead because I already had it.  I thought that the bell pepper and taco seasoning in the beans made this better than other versions of this that I have made.  Almost needless to say, but there were NO leftovers at the end of the meeting (with lots of mostly full dishes left on the table.)  I also found the 9x13 to be a good size.  I might try adding an an extra half can of beans next time as some others have suggested as the bean layer was thinner than the cream cheese/sour cream layer.

I LOVE this recipe as a base, but I made a fair amount of changes. I left out the chopped tomato, pepper, scallions and lettuce, along w/ the cream cheese. My dish ended up like this: Layer 1, taco seasoning mix and refried beans; Layer 2, sour cream; Layer 3, guacamole; Layer 4, salsa; Layer 5, taco sauce; Layer 6, cheddar cheese. The taco sauce and guac really added some spice and kick. This was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again!!

So simple and so delicious! This dip looks great it was everyone's favorite appetizer. I would only make minor changes: add a layer of diced jalapeno peppers as well as a layer of fresh guacamole. Very good!

My husband works at a hospital, and they often have "pot luck" type of lunches, as well as "parties" when people leave or doctors retire....I made this recipe for him for one of these, and his co workers practically licked the dish...I am now asked to bring this to every "food" related celebration, and in fact, I just made another big dish of it tonight for him to take in tomorrow...It is the most requested thing I have ever made!!

Every picnic we are invited to, I am requested to bring this taco dip, and it goes in a flash.  Everyone loves it.  I usually put olives only on half for our pickier eaters to enjoy as well.

Delicious! The 13x9 pan was a perfect size. I omitted the green pepper, green onions and olives and it was still wonderful!

I did not use the bell pepper, tomato or lettuce and this was still quite delish.  I'll definitely make this again.....perhaps next time half guacamole, half without.

this dip is a definite winner.  I substituted the lettuce with guacamole.  The green pepper and sour cream mixed with cream cheese is what sets it apart from other taco/layered dips

It was good, but I omitted the lettuce and green peppers.  But the main reason I did not rate this 5 stars is that I did not necessarily see the point of mixing cream cheese with the sour cream.  More calories, not overwhelmingly more flavor.  Good, but not great.  Thanks though!

Took this to a family gathering.  I didn't have refried beans so subituted drained, mashed black beans.  I had bits and pieces of cheeses, mozarella, jalapino jack and cheedar, also no salsa so a couple splashes of hot sauce.  It disappeared!!!!

This recipe was great, however I added my own touch to the original recipe.  I omitted the lettuce and added a can of chilli to the refried beans. I also used petite diced tomatoes from a can...they are softer.  It was so good that unfortunately I had no leftovers.

It is a great one. However I made a few modifications. I use chunky stile salsa on top of the beans. Then I made some guacamole which I put a bit of sour cream just for a bit of consistency.  Let it rest for a few hours on the refrigerator and magic.. it was sooo soo good I am making this may favorite..

Mine was really runny. I made some modifications, as I think everyone will bc this is a basic recipe. One of the best parts was the cream cheese sour cream mixture, I highly recommend doing that step! I also used some Hormel CHili with no beans, which was pretty good too.

This is outstanding! The best 7 layer dip I've ever made. The cream cheese/sour cream mixture is so good! I made it for a little ladies-get-together and there were only 8 of us here and we polished off the whole thing!

I changed this up a little.  I added green chilis to the beans, and taco seasoning to the cream cheese sour cream mixture as mentioned in a previous review.  I left out the green peppers and olives just cause the birthday girl didn't want them on it.  You can change it up any way you want and it will be delish!  Set it out with homemade tortilla chips and crackers.  They would have licked the plate clean if I would have let them.

This was so delicious!!  I was skeptical if it would be really tasty or not, because it seemed so fast and simple.  It is not too good to be true!  It is EASY, FAST, and DELICIOUS!  I'm bringing this to the next cook-out.  Just a tip, we use authentic, thin Mexican tortilla chips made at a local Hispanic bakery.  They are too thin for this hearty dip.  Go for the sturdy grocery store tortilla chips!

I have to say this recipe is VERY tasty. I think next time though I'm not going to use the tomatoes. I think they made the dish too runny. I'm also going to add a little more spice it..maybe add a chipotle pepper to it. Overall an AWESOME dish.

Made the recipe exactly as written for a 4th of July party. Turned out well, had a lot of leftovers though.  I ended up throwing about 1/2 of it away, because it turned a little too soggy to eat after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. Will make again, but maybe scale down to 1/2 the recipe.

Excellent recipe! We added the taco seasoning to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture instead of the beans. Also, instead of adding salsa, we added chopped cilantro to the tomato/green pepper mixture. When counting the layers on the end, we realized that we'd forgotten the cheese layer. It certainly was not missed! We made a double recipe and both pans were empty by the end of the night! Thanks, Sue, for the great recipe!

Quick easy recipe that disappeared fast. I skipped the lettuce and greeen pepper..so it really wasn't 7 layers..but the taco seasoning mixed with refried beans and the sour cream mixed with cream cheese is different from the normal taco dips that circulate around here..so it was a hit. Thanks for sharing! I will be making it again and again.

This is an amazing recipe!  I am asked to bring it everywhere!  I do substitute some things out, like I don't use , olives, or lettuce, but use guacamole instead (Luann's recipe on Allrecipes) and I add ground beef to the refried beans as well.

This dip is soo good! I'm not a big veggie fan, so instead of tomatoes, I just used a can of Rotel. I also added hamburger meat with taco seasoning. This could be eaten as a meal...it is wonderful!

I personally would have given this 2 stars, my husband 4, so I met in the middle with 3. I thought it was bland and boring, definitely missing something. I'm not a huge fan of cold dips, so this may have influenced my opinion. I think if I ever tried this dip again, I would double the beans, mix the taco seasoning with the sour cream and cream cheese instead of the beans, leave out the lettuce, and add some beef. The salsa (I used a jar of homemade-style) made this dip very runny. If you're looking for a good bean dip, try Ranch Bean Dip on this site. It's wonderful.

This is a fantastic recipe - I made it about a month ago for a BBQ and now everywhere I go everyone wants me to make this recipe.   When I bring it for parties or for a get together it is the first to go.  No changes to this recipe!

Great recipe- so quick and easy to make! Took me no longer than 10 minutes to prepare and make. I followed another member's suggestion to substitute for LIGHT cream cheese and sour cream to reduce calories- and it tasted just as good! Nobody could tell it was less than half the calories! **Instead of nachos, I cut up a bunch of pitas, brushed them w/olive oil and baked them in the oven. Soooo DELICIOUS! Thanks Sue

I love this recipe!  To stretch the recipe I used 2 cans of refried beans, an entire container of guacamole dip, extra mayo and sour cream (no exact amounts).  I also used a container of pico de gallo from the deli instead of just chopped tomato and green onions.  Topped with lots of cheddar cheese - no black olives.  Fabulous!!

Excellent Recipe. I would suggest if you are adding guacomole, to add more beans and taco seasoning. I added that extra layer and it was a very creamy taco dip. I love the creaminess but I like a little mroe beans. To much creaminess can be overwhelming. Quck and easy!

Great! Added home made guacamole, did not add the tomato or olives. Girls at work liked it. Would like to try it with taco meat sometime. Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

My sister has always made some variation of the basic layer dip recipe, but I swear by this website so I looked here first.  I substituted organic black refried beans with roasted red jalapenos for the standard beans, black bean and corn salsa, 3 roma tomatoes instead of one large tomato, yellow pepper instead of green for more color, and 4-cheese Mexican blend instead of cheddar.  I took it to my boyfriend's dad's birthday dinner and everyone loved it! It was a small gathering, but his brother-in-law even claimed the leftovers (half a 9x13) to take home.  This will be a new favorite here.

Easy and good!  I was a bit doubtful about mixing my sour cream and cream cheese, But you can't really even taste the cream cheese.  I loved the beans with the taco seasoning.  I used to mix the taco seasoning with the sour cream but we like this sooo much better.  The empty bowl at the end of the evening is always a good sign!! :)

I loved this recipe, even with low-fat or fat-free ingredients.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, fat free sour cream, fat free refried beans, and 2% fat cheddar cheese.  I took it to a party and it was a big hit!

I thought this recipe was absolutely fantastic, although I substituted my own homemade guacamole for the lettuce and made my own salsa.  I think this dish goes great with a nice cabernet sauvignon.  Of course, light beer works, too.

Great Recipe! Instead of the salsa and chopped vegetables I added a layer of fresh  pico de gallo (chopped onions, tomato and cilantro). This would also be great with a layer or ground beef with taco seasoning...

This was popular although it was very heavy on the cream cheese/sour cream.  I would recommend making doubling the beans and leaving all the rest of the ingredients the same, including the seasoning.  I left off the lettuce and it was great without!

this recipe only lasted a few hours at my new year's party. it was hands-down the favorite food there! i made it with 'light' sour cream, and no one noticed. i am making it again for a party tonight, i am plan on adding tomatillo-guacamole in place of the lettuce for more flavor. i might also add some jalepanos for more heat. i did not have trouble with the dip being watery, as some reviewers noted. i used a natural brand salsa.

Followed the recipe exactly.  We took other readers' suggestions and put this in the oven for about 20 minutes, and it was spectacular!!! Our guests raved about it, and we will be bringing it to parties in the future.

My fiance who hates vegetables loves this dish, pretty much the only way I can get vegetables into him. Made it many many times and still a hit for every person I make it for. Get requests for it from every get together I make it for.

I made homemade salsa and guacamole and it made the dip very fresh tasting. I also ommitted the bell pepper, as I do not care for the taste. Finally, I did not use lettuce as I thought it would wilt easily. With these modifications, the dip turned out terrific. I will make this again!

Tastes great!  Didn't have cream cheese and was in a bit of a hurry.  Warmed beans with salsa, spread in dish, then skipped the cream cheese but mixed the sour cream with taco seasoning, store bought guacamole dip cuz I like it better than REAL guac... covered with cheese and veggies...I nearly lost an arm trying to put it on the table... they devoured it!!!!

The cream cheese/sour cream layer sets this recipe apart from other seven layer dips. I prepared this the night before for tailgating and it held up beautifully in the fridge.

I left out the lettuce & bell pepper and added canned green chilis and diced habenero pepper for extra punch. My friends devoured it! I like this better than store bought!

There are some additions I'd like to try with this dip (like cilantro, corn, black beans, etc.), but I have to rate it as 5 because of all the compliments I got on it! I was worried how it would work out in the 13 x 9 dish, but it worked out just fine. I used Pace Chunky Salsa and it didn't make the dish watery at all. The guacamole added a nice zing to it. Great dish!

You can count on me making this about every 6 weeks. I like to add fresh guacamole. It's also okay the next day as long as its refridgerated, but in that case, I would keep the avocados on the side so it doesn't ruin it.  Great game day snack!

this was a pretty good dip. it was easier than i thought. I used whipped ceam cheese because it was easier to mix in and when i put it in the fridge after i made it until the party the cream cheese didn't re-harden. i would cut the taco seasoning mix in half for my taste it was too salty. Make those two changes and it's a hit.

Sooo good. Made for 4th of July party. The combined flavors remind me of a 7 layer burrito from Taco Bell. Served with "Scoops" tortilla chips. The only thing I did differently, as many others did too from the reviews, was to use guacamole (El Paso gucamole dip) instead of lettuce. Will certainly make again!

I love the way the taco seasoning tastes mixed into the refried bean.  YUM!  I'm not a black olives fan so I left them off and added green chilis instead.  So good!!!

I have made this for over one year now, and I am always asked to bring this dish to parties.  It tastes awesome, you could always play with it but I like this combo especially the CRUNCH of the iceburg lettuce.

This was very good - I got compliments on the fact that I actually used guacamole. I wasn't sure if I would like the salsa I got that I added so I only put it on half - guests at the party were happy with the 2-sided option!

This is really good.  I added a layer of ground beef with taco seasoning and a layer of "guacamole" dip from the dairy case at the store.  It would be better with real guacamole, but it was still really good.  I put the cheese, green onions and black olives on top to garnish.  I will make this one again!

Hit of the party! I put it in a 13 by 9 glass pan. Doubled the beans, used 1 1/2 pkg. taco seasoning, 1/3 of a yellow pepper, about 1/3 cup vadalia onion, romaine lettuce instead of iceburg and I left out the olives. Yummm!

This was fantastic! Took it to my book club and had leftovers to eat that night. Yes, I am guilty of eating a fattening appetizer for dinner. :-) But this was so good I couldn't stop.

This was just awesome!  I made it for a work party and everyone raved about it.  I stuck to "my own" seven layers.  Using the refried beans, sour cream, home made guacamole, salsa,and topped with cheese olives and chopped tomatos.  Eat with corn chips and it's sensational!

Huge hit!!  I've taken this to a couple partys now and they all love it! I also did not use the green pepper, however.

Easy and tasty! I made this for the Superbowl and it got great reviews. Suggestion: use chunky salsa, or drain some of the liquid, because it made it slightly watery in the middle. Otherwise great! I did put a layer of seasoned taco meat on top of the refried beans as suggested by other views. Served with lime flavored tortilla chips!

Wow--this recipe is really, really good.  We wanted to make it for our Super Bowl party tomorrow, but of course, had to do a test batch first (yummy)!!  The only thing is, I added guacamole on top of the refried beans, before the sour cream because so many of our friends love guacamole.  It looks like from your picture that you do the same, even though it isn't in the recipe itself.  Either way, its 5 stars in my book--thanks!

I layered:  Taco meat (hamburger seasoned w/ taco seasoning), refried beans, diced tomato, diced onion, sour cream, cheddar cheese,& salsa.  I dont like olives (reason I gave 4 stars), & didnt use cream cheese.   This recipe is always a big hit.

Good.  This is a recipe I have been doing for a while, but I usually skip the bean layer.  I personally think this layer overpowers the rest of the layers.  Also, a layer of guacamole would be great.

I thought this was okay, I thought the salsa was maybe too much or something,  it seemed to overtake the rest of the ingredients. Other than that, it was good.

Very yummy...substituted store-bought guacamole for peppers/onions/lettuce.  I received many compliments on this recipe and several requests for the recipe itself(although I conveniently "forgot" to give it to them).  Some things I just want to keep for myself and this recipe is definetely one of them!

I would definitely would make this recipe again. It came out delicious. I accidentally stir in the whole dip but still came out good. I didn't add green peppers because I didn't feel the need to. I am in love with this dip. Thank-you

I think I included everything except the kitchen sink in this recipe! It was yummy. I used a can of drained Rotel & some leftover salsa I'd drained...just so it wouldn't get soggy. Also added a layer of guacamole.

Grrrreat dip! I'm not a veggie nut, so I left off the green peppers and olives. And I added a layer of store-bought guac. Yummmmm. Served with nacho cheese Doritos. I get RAVES about this dip. And since it has no beef, I don't worry about meat spoilage when setting out. Will make again and again.

This is a great simple dish to have for any occasion. I've used it for football tailgates, but I recommend keeping the salsa on the side because it tends to get runny after about an hour.

Excellent! I used a small container of sour cream (8 oz)to make it less watery and it was still as good. I also used green chillies on the side to spice it up for those who like hot. Serve with scoops..outstanding. Thank you!

This is very good and can be suited to your tastes.  I prefer it without the salsa layer and without green peppers.  I like the idea of adding guacamole.  That would be delicious in this.

This was just ridiculously delish.  My kids were so upset when I put this dip away so they wouldn't fill up on it before dinner.  I'm giving this 5 stars, however, it's pretty hard to screw up something this simple!

This was an AMAZING hit at a pot luck for work.  I browned 1 lb. of hamburger and mixed in the refried beans, added guacamole on top of the sour cream/cream cheese mixture, and left out the lettuce and tomatoes, because i didn't want it to get wilty and soggy and there was a lot of tomatoe chunks in the salsa.  it was a  HUGE hit.  I highly recommend this recipe! I will be using many many more times in the future.

I took this Mexican dip to a party this weekend and it was gone within 30 minutes! I did make a few changes. Instead of using fresh tomato, I used a can of petite diced tomatoes, I also added a 16 oz can of Mexicorn and used Mexican blend shredded cheese. Will definately make again.

This was sooo easy to make and it was a huge hit! Everyone liked it, and I was even asked for the recipe. I did not use lettuce, as I didn't want it to turn brown and become mushy(if I had leftovers). I halved the recipe and it was plenty for a medium size group. Thank you!

This was very good and was a big hit at a party of about 50 people.  The recipe makes A LOT -- enough to spread on 2 regular sized dinner plates.  The cream cheese isn't completely necesary, but it's good.

I really liked the idea of serving it in the trifle dish ($7 at Walmart).  The cream cheese was a great addition.

Wow this is delicious for breakfast, lunch and dinner! haha! Just kidding but I served this today as an appetizer for my guests at my daughters 1st bday party and everyone loved it there was hardly any left over! I added guacamole to it and I made that by adding just a packet of guacamole seasoning mix stuff and I added the taco seasoning to the cream cheese/sour cream mix in which i didn't add that much cream cheese or sour cream. I felt only half of each that was listed was enough! thanks for the great recipe :) I can't wait to eat the left overs! I forgot to add that this dish is GREAT served cold! After I put it together I put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes and then served it but I put the leftovers away for a few hours and then snacked on it later and it was even better colder. :)

This recipe is a great starting point to work from. I added a layer of guacamole-4 avocados and 2 packs of mix. I omitted olives and green peppers. I substituted fat free sour cream and cream cheese and it was great!

Not bad-- suggested changes:  no lettuce, no cream cheese, more spiciness (maybe add to beans), use high quality thick guacamole.  Make sure beans go to edge of dish for dipping ease.  Consider individual plates instead of party dish.

I made this for a superbowl party and it was a hit!  I left out the green peppers for personal preference.  I also used a large, long platter- I would recommend that otherwise the dip would get piled too high.  I also garnished with olives instead of putting them on top of the cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Everyone's favorite-- people are disappointed when I show up at parties with something else.  Easy to make and makes a lot.  Have 2 bags of tortilla chips ready and use a large serving platter (or divide onto 2) so that you get a taste of everything in each bite.

Everyone loved it! I forgot to add the salsa so I put it on the side...and it worked out great. Did not put the bell pepper in there...it just did not need all that flavor. It was awesome and a great hit---WILL make again!

My potlock go-to. Swapped out black olives for green, and taco seasoning instead of salsa. It's always a hit, especially when served with Hint-of-Lime Tortilla Chips!

I made this recipe for a pot luck at work and EVERYONE just loved it.  The cream cheese combined with the sour cream added an extra touch to this dish.  I can't wait tp have a get together at home or to take it to another party.

I made this recipe for an office picnic and it was wonderful!  Everyone enjoyed it. I has such a great flavor with the seasoning added to the bean mixture instead of the cream cheese/sour cream like other taco dips.  Highly recommended!  Definately a keeper!

It was okay. Not the best or worst, worth a try.  Don't use the blender, it's a real pain to get your mixture out.

This was great!  As one reviewer suggested, I used two cans of refried beans instead of one.  Next time, I think I'll add a layer of ground beef.  You definitely need two bags of tortilla chips - this makes a lot of dip and one bag is not enough!

This taco dip was really good. I did make one change. I put the refried beans as the first layer then I browned up a pound of ground beef added the pack of taco sauce to the beef, made that the 2nd layer and then continued on with the recipe. It got rave reviews!

This was delicious.  I served it at card club, and everyone loved it.  I had some left over, so I took it to work.  It was gone before the breakfast hours were over.  Everyone loved it and has requested it again.

I brought this dip to a super bowl party and it was a hit!  I omitted the bell pepper and olives.  I mixed the taco seasoning with the beans AND with the sour cream and cream cheese.  It was so yummy!  This dip will be a hit for years to come!

Better than I expected. I took the advice of other users and used 1/2 taco seasoning in the beans and the other half with the sourcream.  Also omiited the salsa, lettuce, and green peppers and added a nice layer of chunky guacamole (how do you do 7 layer dip without guac? :) 
Was asked by EVERYONE for the recipe.

This recipe is great for impressing guests, is easy to put together and tastes wonderful. Be 'warned' - it's all too easy to fill up on if it's served as an appetizer...!

Yum!  This was a great "meal" for superbowl sunday.  I had my doubts about mixing the cream cheese into the sour cream, but the flavor was great.  I substituted diced avocado for the bell pepper, and it was fantastic.  I already have requests to make this dish again.

Loved it! I mixed some of the taco seasoning with the sour cream and I used the taco seasoning with the cheese in it (by accident). I like this better without the meat as others have made. 
Will make for more parties!

This dip is great!  This is a very flexible recipe, I had almost everything and added stuff it didn't call for (some left over spanish rice and corn), and it was still awesome.

There really isn't much to say that hasn't been said before. This really is a great recipe! Apart from topping it with sliced jalapenos, I made it exactly as directed, and it was great! (Personally, I like adding the diced tomatoes in addition to the salsa. It just gives it an extra fresh, zingy flavor.) The second time I made it, I used El Paso refried beans, and they were much MUCH saltier than the Meijer brand beans I used the first time. Despite this, it still got gobbled up at Husband's work's potluck. I think this is going to be my staple potluck contribution. Thanks!

I made this for my husband to use up some open cans from fridge and he liked it. I finish layers only with green onions and green olives (all I had) and it was still good. He said "Give it 5"

I should have used only 1/2 the taco seasoning because the beans were way salty.  Also, I wouldn't use a platter because this dish spreads.  The dish you put it in needs to have some depth.  The lettuce is a little awkward to dip into with a chip so either tear the lettuce into smaller pieces or omit them.  We did eat a lot of this dip, although next time I would make some major tweeks in the recipe.

This recipe was a huge success when I brought it to a party.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was use a triffle bowl instead of a platter.  Once all of the ingredients were layered it made a stunning presentation.

Great recipe although next time I would drain the salsa as we found it made it watery and probably eliminate the chopped tomatoes.  We added Jalapeno's to kick it up a bit.  Will make it again!

Took this to a football tailgate party this season (October, 2005) and we had tons of food, prepared by great cooks.  Well, one of the cooks wanted to go ahead and throw away the last little bit, but I stopped her, because one young college man kept eating the very, very last little bit until it was ALL gone.  Enough said!

I followed directions and felt the beans with the taco seasoning was way to salty. I added another can of beans to fix it. Either make your own seasoning with less salt or only use half at first a proceed to taste. Otherwise big hit with everyone.

I liked this dip.  It was so easy to do.  I mixed most of the taco seasoning into the beans and a little bit into the sour cream mix.  I didn't add the diced tomato cause I thought the salso was enough.  You will want to drain the salsa or pick a chunky one or it may be too runny for you.  This is a great dip for a party...there won't be leftovers.

This is a great recipe. I used fat free cream cheese and light sour cream. My co-workers couldn't tell the difference and the entire dip was eaten so quickly that I barely got any myself.

I made this for a family picnic and a lot of people really liked it. I used reduced fat cream cheese and 2% cheddar cheese. Next time I will use fat-free sour cream.I agree with some of the other reviews, you really don't need to add tomatoes on top of the salsa and I used medium salsa.

Awesome dip!! Brought it to a mexican themed dinner party and everyone wanted a copy of the recipe.  I didn't add all of the taco seasoning to the refried beans (only about half the amount). Instead, i sprinkled some into the cream cheese mixture as recommended by others.  I didn't add the lettuce and added a layer of guacamole after the cream cheese layer.  Also for a bit of heat added some chilies which i diced up and sprinkled on top! YUM!

Very good dip, I have made this a couple times and have recieved great comments about it. The only thing I did different was I added the taco seasoning to the sour cream & cream cheese instead of the beans. I will be making this againfor years to come.

i used two cans of refried beans with one packet of taco seasoning, skipped the extra tomatoes, layered it in a 13x9 glass pan . this was so wonderful and easy. this is a great recipe, no need to turn the oven on. it does remind me of the double decker taco from taco bell without the beef.  will make often. thanks!!

This is an excellent dip.  I must've made it 20 times by now, and everyone always raves about it.  Great recipe to take as a "dish to pass" as it makes a LOT.

Delicious!  My husband and I couldn't stop eating it.  I subbed homemade guacamole for the salsa and halved the sour cream mixture per my tastes.  Don't listen to other people saying it doesn't hold up overnight.  I thought it was even better the next day. I was scraping the dish clean, totally bummed there was none left!  Thank you Sue.

five stars all the way. I did not realize how much this makes. Lettuce did not get soggy. Lasted almost 3 days in fridge. Very delicious. I sometimes make this for a meal, instead of going to taco bell id rather make this!!!!

This is very good!  This recipe was one of the dishes I served at a small party (30 people) and very little was left over, which is always a good sign!  After washing lettuce, be sure that as  much water is removed as possible.  Same goes for the olives.  You may want to use a "thick" salsa that isn't too liquidy, as the dip can get a little watery.  So, next time I will be sure that all water is removed from lettuce and olives and use a thicker salsa.  Otherwise, excellent.  I will make it again.

Tastes great and looked really pretty!  Added a few things - guacamole (used recipe on site), black beans, 3 kindso f cheeses (incl. 3 yr. aged Cheddar that dded a little tart to all the yummy sweet and salty).  

I used 1 whole package of taco seasoning that was 1.25 ounces, and I felt like it was just a tad too much spice. no one seemed to notice, but it seemed a bit much to me.  Also, the cream cheese is a FABULOUS idea!!

This was great I made it for the NFC/AFC championship and man did it fill up four very large men. We had other appetizers but this one was the best buy far. Make sure you use a big pan to put it in. ENJOY!

Awesome, standard dip that I have been making for years. You can vary the ingredients/toppings to suit tastes. Can use reduced fat ingredients. I always buy the shredded lettuce in the bag. Yummy!

This is a good taco dip that was popular with most guests.  Served this with tortilla scoops.  There are less time consuming taco dips out there, but this did make a nice presenation on the platter.

Ok, ok.  Just like some of you I thought 7 layer dip was pretty boring.  But I was asked to make 7 layer dip to bring to a party and I chose this recipe.  IT IS FABULOUS!  It got RAVE reviews.  The green pepper really adds to a great flavor.  I omitted the lettuce becuase lettuce can get pretty soggy if left out at room temp.  EVERYONE LOVED THIS!  It was the first appitizer to be completely eaten out of 7 appetizers that were out on the table.  I will be making this very often.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!

Watch the sodium content of the taco
seasoning you buy; the one I chose made the beans so salty, I had to add an extra can of beans.  I used the beans with green chiles and skipped the green pepper.

Thanks for the awesome recipe!  This is not your average taco dip! The addition of the salsa is wonderful. I left out the black olives and green peppers due to some picky eaters. I used the shredded mexican blended cheeses. Mmmm-mmm-good!

I made this for my son's preschool graduation.  It went fast and even some of the little kids ate it because I used mild salsa.  I used about three-quarter of a packet of taco seasoning and I think I'll decrease it to half next time.  Someone said it tasted like it was from Taco Bell.

Outstanding.  I had never tried a dip like this, but made it for a party based on the ratings here.  It was even better than I expected.  People were scooping up gobs of it and going back for more.  I used the scoop chips as recommended by a prior reviewer and a LARGE serving platter with a rim.  Perfect!

It must have been good.  My inlaws/outlaws came over.  B/w my mother/father in law and my sister in law and her boyfriend it was all gone in 15mins.  I got to scrap the bottom of the dish.  Seemed good to me too.

yep! Another 5 stars! This was really delicious! I added a layer of guacamole. I also minced the tomatoes, green onion and pepper together as one layer.

Wow!  What a great dip!  I served it at a party and it was a total hit.  I added a layer of guacomole dip and it was excellent.  I will definately be making this again soon.  Thanks!

Such an easy, tasty recipe! All of my guests loved it and asked for the recipe. The key is seasoning the refried beans! I intentionally left out the lettuce.

I had to dig to find the recipe again, and glad I did!  Last time we made it, it was inhaled, and I've had more requests... 
One note - someone said they replaced the refried beans with hamburger.  The only caution I would use there is if you think the dip will be sitting out for more than two hours, you might want to re-think the meat.  It doesn't hurt the dairy mixture as much, due to the other ingredients mixed in, but meat could be prone to more bacteria. 

Of course, this is an unnecessary warning, since it is doubtful this dip will last long enough to worry about refrigerating it!  Ha!

Make it, buy plenty of tortilla chips and let them dig in....

Excellent! I always have to make this for any get together, and it disappears in no time. I don't put the olives and bell pepper on though, no one here likes them. I do use a 13x9 sized pan, everything else is too small.

Fantastic, and I'm a tough critic. Used a 9 by 13 pan, and it filled it -- so be prepared this makes a lot of dip. Agree with others that the taco seasoning works great in the sour cream/cream cheese layer. Even after reading the reviews, I was still surprised this turned out so great, it's way too easy. Thanks!

Great Dip!  I didn't use tomatoes but used Cilantro salsa. Added green chilli's.  I put loads of veggies on top, it was GREAT!  Buy SCOOP chips and have a serving spoon near by,cause it is a tall dip.

Great recipe.  Will make again.  

Added some chopped chiles, a stray avacado and some lime juice from my fridge - but only because it was around.  Would've been just as good without it.

The dish was a hit.

Everyone loved this including my kids.  I took someone elses suggestion and mixed the taco seasoning with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  It worked out really well that way.

One of our favorites.  We even make this for a cool, fun supper sometimes.  I like to mix a little garlic powder and chili powder in with the sour cream mixture.  I usually don't put bell pepper on with the vegies as most of my family doesn't like raw pepper.  Its still delicious no matter what you add, or subtract!

Postively Terrific! I've made this twice now, doubled the recipe to make two big plates. The company gobbled it up each time! Both Plates! I think one thing that makes it really great is the tacco spices (pre-packaged) mixed with the re-fried beans. I'd had a recipe previous that didn't call for the peppers or green onions. My group seems to very much enjoy their addition. Of course you can leave out any little topping you don't like, example many don't want the peppers or maybe the olives to top it with. Whatever you like you and adjust. LOVE IT!

I made this exactly as written. The dish was very easy to put together. Everyone enjoyed it. I will make it again. The recipe made a lot more than I expected. I will use a larger platter next time, maybe 8"×12" or 9"×13".

My whole family LOVED IT!!! It took a little longer than 15 minutes to make it but it turned out great. the only thing I changed was I used pepper jack cheese because I forgot to buy the cheddar cheese but I believe that made it better.

I followed the suggestion to use Rotel instead of the tomato and pepper. I drained the Rotel so it didn’t make my dish watery. The dip is delicious and and was a huge hit!

I love this dip!
Instead of using a full pack of taco mix in the beans, I use half and the remaining half in the sour cream. The green peppers add texture.  I feel the cream cheese helps stabilize the sour cream.  This recipe is always a winner!

So it’s a great base recipe. But I made an eight layer. And I took out the green pepper or lettuce. I started with the beans I used black refried beans. Than I mixed the sour cream cream cheese together and spread it evenly.then I added chopped tomatoes then a layer of homemade guacamole. I then added salsa then black olives and topped it all off with sharp cheddar and green onions. Loved it so delicious ??

I always get rave reviews for this one - it's so easy to assemble and such a crowd pleaser! My layer is as such: beans with the taco seasoning; cream cheese and sour cream; salsa; guacamole; lettuce with cilantro and green onion; cheese; black olives.

Had made something similar before, but the creme cheese in this recipe really kicked it up a notch. Easy to make and NO leftovers!! Will make it again for sure!

My family loves this dip.  I have made it for years.  The only change I make is by adding the taco seasoning to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  It definitely spreads the seasoning out more and everyone raves over it!

Prepared the refried bean/taco seasoning, sour cream/cream cheese layers night before, morning of event added rest of ingredients.  The only thing I didn't add was the black olives as I don't like them.  Definitely going to make again.  Served with nacho chips.  Even better day 2.

Excellent and very easy to make.  I did change it a bit. Left out the cream cheese, added some taco seasoning to the sour cream layer and swapped the lettuce for guacamole. It was very good and received lots of praise from co-workers.

This is a very good basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to your own liking. 
One reviewer stated that cream cheese doesn't belong in this dip. Well, I suppose not if you're trying to make authentic Mexican, but I think the creaminess is what makes this dish. It balances nicely with the robust flavor of the taco seasoning, tomatoes, onions, and olives.
Next time I will add a layer of guacamole.
This would go nicely with black beans and corn also.

this turned out really good-I did mix the beans and taco mix with a mixer because it wasn't blending very well.
The end result with fresh vegetables was delicious!

Great dip!! I used a 9x13 pan and thought at first that it would be too big because recipe called for a large serving platter.Nope, perfect size and if I used all the ingredients this called for, it wouldn’t fit. I used 1/2 head of lettuce and 1 cup of hand grated Colby Jack cheese because that’s what I had on hand. Very tasty and I like how my vegetarian friends can enjoy it, too.

I love this recipe! I brought this to a drama potluck as well as just ate it at home and everyone loved it and kept going back for more! I personally didn't put the olives on because I don't like them. The first time I made it, I didn't put very much lettuce on because I was worried about it wilting, but I found it too cheesy. The second time I made it, I put on the whole head of lettuce (or, most of it) and it was much better and didn't even wilt! I also discovered that it doesn't really matter what type of bell pepper you use because no one can tell the difference anyways, so just use whatever you have on hand! Definitely recommend trying it!

This is the perfect base recipe. I left off the lettuce, green peppers & tomatoes (it has salsa!). One thing I did was drain my salsa before adding it to the dip. I was concerned that it would make the dip watery. Just depends on how much liquid your salsa has. This is a recipe that you can adjust to your liking. There was not a bite left! Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is probably my favorite nacho/taco dip I've ever made. It was really easy and made a HUGE amount, perfect for a big family snack or a party. The addition of the taco seasoning to the refried beans gave a tasty kick. I will definitely make this again. Great on chips or rolled up in a warm burrito wrap!

This didn’t wow. Not enough dimension. Some people thought the lettuce layer was unusual. I think I should of drained the salsa as it made the dip sort of runny. I made this recipe as written. It was good but not great.

Don’t think you need cream cheese and sour cream. I would skip the cream cheese. Another review suggested leaving iff the green pepper. After using the green pepper maybe leaving it off would be better.

My family loved this dip. I did make some changes. I substituted Neufachel cheese for the cream cheese and poblano and ancho chilis for the bell pepper. It was excellent!

Great first three layers for a base, but I omitted tomatoes and lettuce and added avocado to make my 7 layers: beans, cream cheese mixture, salsa, sliced olives, cheese, diced avocado, chopped green onions. Totally done in less than 30 minutes. A couple suggestions: try using refried black beans. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

This dip was amazing! I took it to work for s carry-in and didn't bring a drop home. The only thing I might do a little different (and this is simply a taste preference) I would use more beans...and like a lot of others I didn't use green pepper. I didn't want to turn up the heat for folks at work, but for home I'm going to add some fresh jalapenos.

Such a great recipe and so adaptable.  I love all the ideas!  I haven't seen this yet and I do it often so I thought I would share.  I use half sour cream, half cottage cheese.  Nobody even notices and the additional protein is better than just the sour cream.  I left out the onion and green pepper and added chopped jalepenos and cook when done layering.  I add the lettuce on top when serving so it won't  get soggy.  EXCELLENT.  I home mix my taco seasoning also.

Delicious!  Party favorite.  Followed the directions with two minor changed based on my personal preference.  1.  Cut the amount of cream cheese in half.  2. Added homemade quacamole on top of Bean layer.  Will make again for sure!

It came out great! I removed the tomatoes, bell pepper, and lettuce for personal taste (and I didn't want the lettuce to wilt), but it was perfect without them :)

I will be leaving out the fresh tomato as it made the dip soupy over time.  Otherwise, a home run.

I forgot to get the green pepper so I diced up purple onion for added color. It was a huge hit!  People were scraping the dish to get every drop.  Will definitly make this easy dish for gatherings.

Great! I also left out the green peppers and lettuce and instead put a layer of homemade guacamole ("Easy Guacamole" on this site). And I subbed in Greek whole plain yogurt for the sour cream/cream cheese mix. Was so good, kids liked the dish!

Delicious.  I did not deviate from the recipe as written.  I did allow the tomatoes to drain after cutting, and while prepping other veggies.  Everyone went crazy for the dip.  It is certainly a keeper and will be repeated.

I made this minus the lettuce, green peppers, and cream cheese  for a few parties in the last few years and everyone loved it so much they ate it as a dip and as a type of taco salad. Every party that comes up my family and friends ask me to make this so I will be making it for years to come.

It was good, but I couldn't eat too much of it because it had too much sour cream.  Next time I'll double the refried beans and half the sour cream.

It turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t add the green onions! I made sure the bottom two layers were perfectly lined up. It was a work of art I must say! And so yummy!!!

I just use the recorded beans with chilies, but don’t use taco seasoning .  Too much sodium for a sodium restricted diet .

I made this today and we didn’t think it was that great. There is a lot of the sour cream mixture. Also, be mindful of the taco seasoning you’re using. Mine wasn’t very good. It impacted the whole dish. I omitted the lettuce as well. Overall, I wouldn’t make this again.

Yummy, with guacamole instead of green pepper. Next time I’ll omit the taco seasoning. I think it would be better without it.

I have made this taco dip twice now, and both times our guests have raved about it...and fought for the last scoop!
It requires a little bit of time and knife work to prepare, but well worth it.
I serve this dip with dices jalapenos and guacamole salsa as a side.
Simply Amazing!!

I made some changes - I omitted the peppers - I didn't think the peppers were a right taste - I use two cans of refried beans as the base in a 11 x 13 - I mix the taco mix in the sour cream and cream cheese mix for the next layer, I then add a layer of shredded chicken which I add to the salsa for a thicker mix, then I add the lettuce, green onions, tomatoes, cheese and olives....everyone likes it that way.

Took this to work for a pot luck. It was a big hit! I left out the lettuce as someone suggested  it may wilt. I would for sure make this again and maybe a separate one just for me. :)

Good base, but I changed some things. Basically I skipped the lettuce and green peppers and subbed green onions for red onions (because that's what I had on hand).

My version is a bit different, ditch the cream cheese, replace with homemade (store bought in a pinch, but make it a good brand), guacamole.  Skip the green pepper and lettuce.  Use coarsely chopped cilantro.  I make 2 pans one with no onions or cilantro and the other one with lots of onions and cilantro.  Both are always one of the first dishes to go quickly, along with my grilled shrimp cocktail and deviled eggs . . . Have been making for 35+ years and people still love it.  If you want to make extra special, after the refried bean layer, use pulled pork or ground beef cooked with fajita seasonings.  Enjoy!

Yummy!  I did make some changes to make it more like something I had back in 5th grade.. lol

Beans went down first.
** Then ground beef (cooked with some taco seasoning.)
I mixed the sour cream and cream cheese with the taco seasoning instead of the mixing the seasoning into the  beans.
Then added cheese, tomato, olives, and a bit of lettuce on top. :)

This recipe is amazing. I made it for a super bowl get-together, and received a lot of compliments.
I did change up a couple of things.
I heated up the refried beans before adding the taco seasoning mix.
I used pico de gallo instead of chopping up tomatoes, onions, and peppers. The taste was delicious, and much less prep time.

Very good and easy to make! I think I may drain a little of the 
juice from the salsa next time so next day leftovers won't be
very runny. But very very good!!!!!!!

I added a layer of seasoned ground beef. I never add any shredded lettuce as I feel the dip takes on a lot of moisture as it is. Lettuce just makes it worse.  I also added a layer of guacamole. I did seasoned beans, sour cream/cream cheese mixture, guacamole, seasoned meat, salsa, cheese,  and chopped veggies (tomatoes, green peppers, black olives, green onions)

Made this for Super Bowl 51.  It was a big hit.  Only real change was that I made my own taco seasoning instead of store bought.

I added some chopped jalapeño along with the bell pepper and left off the olives. Next time I will not add the lettuce but the overall flavor was great!

This was very tasty. I added a can of drained green chilies to the refried beans and a Tbsp. of chili powder instead of the Taco seasoning, which bumped up the flavour. I also used Greek yogourt to replace the sour cream but that was a big mistake as it didn't want to blend with the cream cheese and resulted in a lot of fluid at the bottom of the dish. I drained that off but.........lesson learned !!!!

Big hit!!! I made this for the Super Bowl we had about 8 guests. I made BBQ to go along with it. Everyone pounced on this dip and left most of the BBQ... it was gone in a bling of an eye. I served with Tostitos Scoops tortilla chips and Frito's Scoops.  I followed close to main recipe but used a few suggestions from others. Made it in a 9x13 Pyrex glass baking pan and used an electric hand mixer for mixing. I used 2 cans of black bean refried beans and mixed with a package of Taco Seasoning and a couple of TBS's of Kroger brand chunky salsa drained - this made it a little softer so not to break the chips when dipping. Second layer was cream cheese and sour cream mixed with a half packet of Taco Seasoning. Next layer was Chunky Salsa and I drained in strainer to get all the watery liquid out this is a must so that your dip doesn't get watery. Next layer was guacamole I made from recipe on this site (Bob Cody). Next layer was chopped green pepper, I omitted the green onion because I had a red onion and garlic in the guacamole. Next layer was a can of drained diced tomatoes with green chilies. Next layer was shredded cabbage, I used instead of lettuce because it won't wilt as fast, I bought a bag of coleslaw mix and it really worked out well. Next layer was shredded sharp cheddar cheese then topped off with a small can of sliced black olives. I baked on 350 for 30 minutes and when it came out MAN everyone stood around with there eyes bugged out!!! My son woke up next day and ask

This dip was a huge hit! I recommend using spicy taco seasoning and/or adding   jalapeños for some added kick. Also make sure to use a large dish because this recipe makes a lot.

So next time I make this I will not try to make a "healthy" version. I used lite sour cream and cream cheese and that part ended up coming out very runny. It was still delicious but I would imagine it would have been much better had I avoided the low calorie, low fat options.

I have been making this recipe for many years now and I love it. It is awesome. Since I am in Germany, I make my own refried beans and I don't always get cheddar so I use other kinds of cheeses, but that does not take away from the quality of dip. My husband wants it, my mom wants it, my kids love it and I don't even need to show up at a potluck if I do not bring my seven layer taco dip.

Very very yummy. Next time I make it though, I will only use half the amount of taco seasoning and I will omit the olives for personal dislike. Otherwise this was fantastic!

Made this for a party  a few nights ago. Everyone loved it. I made a couple changes; I didn't use any lettuce or green pepper.  In my opinion, green pepper doesn't belong in a taco dip, and lettuce wilts in a relatively short amount of time.

I used 2 cans of refried beans, not one. I used romaine, and not iceberg lettuce. Also, please not the refried beans are NOT heated. This is a cold dish. If you make ahead of time, wait to add the toppings that go on top of the lettuce. ALSO, I do NOT put the salsa ON the 7 layers. I serve it on the side so the dish not get runny. It stays fresh over night, then. :) YUMMM!

Absolutely perfect! Made it exactly as directed the first time, and everyone loved it. But lately I'm not too fond of the beans, so I now just cook some hamburger to stir the taco spices into and use that instead. Either way, it's always gone within minutes - never any left overs!

Always a favorite. I used some suggestions posted.  I sautéed some ground beef and added a little taco seasoning and water then mixed with beans for my base layer.  Used cream cheese/sour cream/taco seasoning for my 2nd layer.  Mashed avocado for 3rd layer. Tomatoes for 4th layer (will not do again, too watery) Salsa for 5th layer (I used Chi Chi's medium) Shredded cheese for 6th. Olives for 7th. Topped with lettuce (will either use much less or omit all together.) 
Very yummy any way you make it.

This was a big hit. I doubled down on the refried beans and heated them with one pack of taco seasoning and  about 4 ounces of banana peppers with juice. I also made my own salsa and guacamole and left them on the side.

I am rating this although I did not actually get to taste it. It was the first item finished off at my latest work potluck and I didn't even get any! I added a little salsa to the bean mix and then I topped the beans with the remaining salsa (pretty thick). I hoped this would solve any mess issues people have described. I had to use a food processor for the sour cream and cream cheese, in order to make it smooth. Then I topped it with cheese, lettuce, more cheese, the green onions, tomatos and black olives. From what I saw there didn't seem to be much of a mess and there was no time for any lettuce wilting. I should have made double.

Made this yesterday for a potluck.  Here's what I would change: use 1/2 - 2/3 packet taco seasoning... or a low sodium version as a whole packet is too salty.  cut the sour cream/ cream cheese quantity in half.  I made fresh guac and added that layer after the sour cream/cream cheese layer, then light layer of salsa, black olives, green onion, lettuce, ending with cheese.  It was pretty good.  I will continue to tweek until I get it to my taste.

Had less than 40 people at the party and they ate it all up.
Had a few single men in attendance and they asked for the recipe to take home for their wives.
Its winner.

This dip is freaking awesome!!!!! I honestly couldn't have asked for a better 7 layer dip. It's a great base recipe, and I did make a few changes. I took out the lettuce, green peppers and I tomato's. I felt the dish didn't need it. However I did add in guacamole and it was awesome!! Here were my layers (from bottom to top): 1.5 cans of refried beans mixed with taco seasoning, sour cream/cream cheese mix, guacamole, chunky salsa (that's been drained, otherwise it will be a runny mess), a bunch of finely shredded cheese, olives and green onions. It was a huge hit at the BBQ! I have to admit, I'm glad there was a little left over so I could pig out on it when I got home. I also used Tostitos Scoops for the chips, since its a pretty thick dip. Enjoy! And try not to eat too much!

This recipe it was a much bigger hit than I anticipated.  It allows for you to to meet everyone's needs. I didn't use lettuce or green pepper, but used all the other ingredients. I warmed it up slightly just to melt the cheese, served it with some chips And there was barely anything left. I will definitely make this again.

I made it for a tailgating party and several people commented on how good it was. I made some changes by adding homemade guacamole and not adding bell peppers or lettuce. I also added canned green chilies that I mixed with the fresh tomatoes.

Hubby & all the family REALLY liked this.  I omitted the green pepper, because there was enough deliciousness without it!!  It was a great change from the taco dip I've made in the past, which doesn't include refried beans and salsa.  This is a winner!!!

As my system seems to object to green peppers, I did not use them.  Didn't change anything else and took this dish to a potluck "do" tonight and got rave reviews, as I always do when I make this dish.  I've made it several times and will continue to use this fabulous dip.

I messed up and used double the amount of beans. But I think that helped because the sour cream would have been too much. I also cut back on the cream cheese to 4 oz. Absolutely drain off the liquid in the salsa or it will be too soupy. Season sour cream with some taco seasoning. No. Lettuce or green pepper.

My husband and I love this dip and have eaten leftovers for lunch! I used only half a package of taco seasoning . I liked the cream cheese/sour cream combo. I covered that with Pace salsa, lots of sharp Cheddar cheese and sliced olives. I skipped the lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and green peppers to increase its appeal with picky eaters and to decrease my prep time. The guacamole addition sounds good. Will probably try that next time.

This is a good base recipe.  Had to make changes since many of the ingredients just don't work for me:
1 LB of lean turkey with the taco seasoning,
8oz sour cream mixed with 4oz cream cheese,
16oz salsa - drained,
1 bell pepper ( any color ),
2 c shredded cheese.
I bring large size Frito chips.  This is always a hit wherever I go.

This is always a big hit for me at pot lucks. I get asked often to please bring the wonderful layered taco dip. I mix the taco seasoning with the sour cream and cream cheese mixture and I omit the green peppers for a can of drained/rinsed black beans. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe, as written, early Christmas morning for a family get together later that evening. Everyone has something in here that they say they "don't like". I'm over trying to please everyone, so I bought 2 red oval serving dishes from the dollar store and made/served the dip in one and put Mission Brand Tortilla Strips in the other. The dip ingredients were layered and placed in such a way that everyone could serve themselves what they liked and not have to include what they didn't like. Everyone loved the dish. I loved two things:  easy breezy recipe to make and they could keep my serving dishes. UPDATE: This recipe has been requested again for this year's Christmas family get together and I am preparing it in exactly the same way.

I use spicy refried beans and a hot taco seasoning.    I use preshredded bagged lettuce. I've made this twice now for ladies game night and it was the only dish completely finished both times!!! Its great with any kind of tortilla chip but I prefer the blue corn chips :)

I tweaked the recipe slightly, I added jalapeño refried beans instead of regular; it was very pleasing to my taste buds. I also learned that with this recipe less is more with somethings. I wouldn't put as much cream cheese in as was suggested, but that's only because it was a little over whelming with the other sour cream additive. But other than that it was awesome and my boyfriend and I loved it so much! Thank you for the recipe! ??

Inexpensive and easy, this dip is always a hit.  Keeps incredibly well, so can be made ahead.

Very good. After reading the reviews I only made two small changes. I put about one third of the cheese on top of the heated bean layer and I chose to leave off the lettuce.

I made this recipe a while back for my husband. I made guacamole at home and I left out lettuce, green pepper and olive since I don't like it that much... My husband and I loved it so much, we didn't expect it to be that much... We ate half of it for couple days & we had to throw out rest since it was going bad... It will be really nice idea for group since for 2 of us it was just too much... Next time, I will cut it in half or 1/3 before making it... 5 stars from me...

This dip was amazing! My aunt, whose favorite food is the 7-layer taco dip, was impressed! Although it was time consuming, I shredded the cheese by hand vs. using the already shredded cheese, which was way more flavorful and healthier. I will definitely make this again!

I don't use the lettuce and sometimes leave the green onions out, as some people don't like them. Regardless, this simple recipe has people asking me to make it on almost every party gathering. I've used this recipe for over 4 years now.

Skip the lettuce, it goes mushy.  I add a layer of Mexican flavored ground beef instead.  Great the next day.

I made this for the 4th and everyone loved it. I also decorated the top to look like a flag using black olives sliced up and formed stars and cherry tomatoes sliced for the rows. The cheese was the top layer to pull it off. I realized later that I could have used white cheese to make it look even better. I will make this again very soon as it was so easy and a huge hit!

This is what my kids call "the Gourmet Version" of taco dip.  They can make a meal of it.  I like it because it is so versatile.  You can swap out different peppers, salsas, guacamole, etc., and it is ALWAYS delicious!

There may be another dip recipe available on all recipes.com, but I changed the cheese layer to cream cheese and canned green chiles-this gives the layer a little more substance.  I left the salsa layer and I agree about the lettuce it does become soft quickly, but for my family of 8 it's gone before the lettuce wilts!  Yummy!

Ive always done my dip another way but decided to try this.  That was a mistake, I had quite a bit left and was a little disappointed.  I'll be going back to my old way.

By the time you pick up all the ingredients, it's a little pricey, but nice for something special. It definitely went over big at the party I took it to, but not so much with my family, who aren't much into refried beans.

Made the recipe exactly as written the first time, and would rate it a 4. I made a layer of guacamole on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer, and it turned into a 5!  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this twice for parties. Every time I make it, people love it. It is great with black bean tortilla chips.
It is very easy to make. I recommend

definitely not good with the taco seasoning...makes it way to salty.  Also, WAY too much sourcream/cream cheese. It ends up being the dominant flavor.  Needs to be cut in half at the very least, or just use 8 oz of sour cream and omit cream cheese. Left out lettuce b/c figured it would start wilting.  WOuld make again with these changes.

I substituted low fat cream cheese and sour cream (with plain yogurt to make 16 oz) and added guacamole. It was a hit with my boyfriend and roommate and was cheaper than the exact same thing at a local grocery store.

I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this -- it barely fit in a 2 quart oval serving dish! I skipped the lettuce just because I ran out of room. I thought it should have had guacamole, but I made it by the directions. Next time, I'll leave out the lettuce and green pepper, and add guac like another reviewer suggested. YUM all the same! (Great for my super bowl party)

I have made this four times and everytime the dish is cleaned out. My family requested it for the super bowl. I followed reviewers advice and put it in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes and it came out perfect. Left out the lettuce and green peppers.

My guy practically ate the whole thing by himself! I omitted the bell pepper, added a layer of guacamole and used a Mexican cheese blend instead of straight cheddar. Next time, I might throw 3/4 cup of Mexicorn into the mix. Great, easy dip!

AhhhMazing! Made it for an apartment warming and everyone loved it, and many asked for the recipe. I tweaked it little, since I'm allergic to onions, and had vegetarian friends. I basically ended up using: refried vegetarian beans with home made tacosreasoning (same as packet minus the onion powder), sour creme cheese mix, homemade guacamole with jalapenos,can of fire roasted tomatoes, black olives, cheddar cheese, toupped with sprinkle of green onions (on one side)

I made this for a party this weekend and it was a big hit.  Because I made it in advance I omitted the lettuce (afraid it would get soggy) and added a layer of guacamole between the bean and cream cheese layer.  Also, I forgot to buy salsa, but had a jar of taco sauce in the house.  This worked out great with the layer of fresh veggies on top.

Love this!  I add some sour cream to the cream cheese which makes it smooth and easier to pick up with chips.  I bring this when the girls play cards and they all love it.

This was very good.  I made it this afternoon for a picnic and everyone loved it!  I don't care for olives, but like many reviews have said, it is easy to adapt for your tastes.  I knew that some of the guests would like the olives so I garnished half of the dish with them and left the other half without.  I will definitely make this again!

i used tofutti sour cream and cream cheese, mixed taco seasoning in with them instead of with the beans. i added a little bit of chili powder and cayenne to the beans.   next time, i'll omit the sour cream, its just too heavy and calorie laden for me.

No wonder so many people have saved and rated this recipe.  It is definately a keeper and super easy to make, especially since you can buy everything already chopped up.  I mean the hardest thing was mixing the bean mixture and sour cream/cheese mixture.  Thank you!

This was delicious!  I had a grill out and wanted an appetizer, this turned out to be a hit.  Even people who don't like sour cream were loving it.  I did add guacamole to half of it for the gauc lovers.

I usually make this recipe omitting the lettuce & cream cheese. (personal preference) and instead add the taco seasoning to the sour cream.  Is always GONE fast!

Big hit - I even loved it and hate beans.  I did mix the seasoning in with the sour cream n cream cheese as others suggested and used red and yellow bell peppers for more color.  My only criticism is the portions/servings - I dont think it yields 56 servings and what is considered a large serving platter?  The recipe was not quite enough for a 13x9 and too much for an 9x9.

This is a wonderful recipe. The only thing i changed was i used half of the taco packet. It gets too salty for my taste if you use the whole thing. I will make time and time again!!!!!!

This dip is awesome!  Took to a big family function & what a hit!  Made a few modifications to reduce the calories & fat, etc.  Used Fat Free Sour Cream, Reduced Fat Cheese, no Lettuce, Used Salsa (fresh made daily) at our favourite Lone Star Restaurant, Used 95% Fat Free Cream Cheese & Used Sodium Free Taco Seasoning & last but not least, Omitted the olives. - LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Oh my goodness, this is heavenly! I added a layer of guacamole, and omitted the olives (not a fan) and bell pepper. You can definitely play around with the different layers and ingredients to adjust to your own taste.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I didn't get to actually try any...it was gone in a flash!  We did leave out the lettuce, tomato, and pepper because my boyfriend was supposed to chop them up and forgot..Nobody seemed to mind, though.

Fantastic!  I wanted to try something different from regular chips and salsa for a small BBQ and this was perfect!  My husband doesn't like sour cream so I cut the mixture in half and also added a layer of guacamole.... soooo good!  I will make this again and again!

The dip was ok.  It lacked flavor.  I had this recently at a party next to the chicken wing dip.  The wing dip was gone before there were too many bites taken out of this.  So much more needs to be added to this before I would recommend this recipe.

I used a large can of refried beans and the flavor is still fine. I also left out the olives since, I made it  for my husband's group of high school newspaper kids. They love it.

This dip is a huge hit especially in the spring and summer months. I keep it a bit healthier by using Fat Free Refried beans, low sodium Taco seasoning, reduced fat shreeded cheddar, and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. It still tastes AWESOME - also this is great for anyone that is on a low carb diet, just skip the chips and dip with fresh sliced peppers or grape tomatoes!   The fact that it is a cold dip makes it so refreshing on a hot day. I brought to a party once and everyone demaned the recipe, it has been made by various friends of mine too!

Loved the recipe as written. I only used a very small amount of salsa as I didn't want the dip to get soupy. I also omitted green peppers as I didn't think it would fit our tates. I displayed the dip very beautifully on a cake platter for an Easter appetizer and everyone raved about the presentation and taste. Also omitted lettuce for fear of wilting. BIG HIT!

I took this to an office party and it got rave reviews.  I left out the lettuce and bell pepper, and used a Mexican cheese blend instead of just Cheddar.  So easy and so good!

This has become my recipe that I am begged to take to parties! I tried the sour cream/cream cheese mix and it was too much so I just use sour cream. I also don't put  in the peppers or lettuce. Thanks Sue

Perfect party dip! Even for teens/college kids who normally just want junk food - they gobbled this up, veggies and all. I added just one thing: a tablespoon or so of cilantro mixed into the cream cheese/sour cream layer. You could sprinkle it anywhere, though - it gives it an extra kick of fresh tang.

Gave it 4 stars because I have to do a little tweaking.  It will be 5 stars when served warm (which I tried with a little left-over).  I too didn't include the lettuce but use guacamole.  The taco seasoning was mixed with the sour cream & cream cheese mixture for flavor.    I broiled it for 2 minutes just to melt the cheese.  Will be a staple for every Mexican themed party.

This is a party favorite at our house. I usually split the recipe into two 8X8 pans to have them in different areas of the house for parties. There are never leftovers.

This was so good.  I used jalapeno refried beans and hot taco seasoning just to spice it up, I popped the beans in the microwave just to make them easier to spread.  A 9x13 pyrex dish worked perfectly for me.  I made the recipe exactly as written except for the bell pepper, I definitely would NOT omit the lettuce like some reviewers...it gives it a nice crunch and I had no problem with wilting but then again it didn't sit around very long:)  It was a perfect Superbowl snack, thanks for sharing!

This is was really good. Word of advice, you'll need a large container preferably something with sides. I made the mistake of using a plate, and it overflowed a bit. But this is great for game day. I changed it up a bit. I didn't use green bell pepper or green onions, only used a little bit of cream cheese and added a layer of guacamole. It turned out excellent.

This was good. I followed the recipe other than adding fresh home "guacamole" from the site as well as skipping the "fresh veggie section" and heating as suggested. This was good. For a large group, I can see how it would disappear. Thanks for sharing.

Had a Christmas get-together with my preschool executive board last month. Wasn't sure what to serve for appy's since I bake more than I cook...found this recipe, tossed it at my hubby and said "get to work"! It was FABULOUS! What a hit! My hubby NEVER makes anything, and since this party he's made it on SIX different occasions!    Thanks so much for this one!

This dip tastes as wonderful as it looks!  I substituted an equal weight of cottage cheese, blended smooth, for half the sour cream.  The resulting combination was a winner.  I also used guacamole instead of the lettuce, but I think the crunchy lettuce pieces would probably be a plus.

This is always a winner!  Try this delicious, but not exactly calorie-free, variation:  take a tube (two for large servings) of crescent rolls and roll them out like a pizza dough.  They will spread as you roll them and become seamless. Cook it until it's golden brown.  375 degrees, maybe 15 minutes.  Then make the dip the way you like it right there on the crescent roll pizza.  Good stuff!

This is an amazing taco dip recipe.  I make this for my pot luck luncheons at work and everyone asks "who made the taco dip??"  It is so delicious.  The beans mixed with the taco seasoning and the sour cream mixed with the cream cheese are what really makes this great.  I omit the green bell pepper and the the black olives because I don't like either.  Other than that I make it exactly as written.  I usually double all of the ingredients because everyone loves it and always wants seconds.

FANTASTIC! I made this for my family holiday party and it was gone in the first hour.  My only problem was how watery it was.  I tried draining the salso but it didnt help .  Regardless, this was an awesome dish.  I will definitly make this again!

I made this for a party and had to pull people out of the kitchen away from it to join activities in the other room a few times!  Then finally to bring it in with us. :)  Makes a ton but definitely the best layered taco dip all of us commented we've had to date.  Thanks for sharing!

Really great stuff... i did not follow the recipe and i used to cans of beans instead and i still felt that there was a need for more beans and less sour cream... but it was a hit!

I have a big round platter that I use for this fantastic dip.  I put the beans & sour cream mix the night before & chill it and then the following day add the other bits that we prefer. Super easy, versatile and very yummy!  Never any left overs!

I am asked to make this for all get togethers. It is very easy and quick to throw together. You can even make it a day ahead, although I wait till just before serving to add cheese so it doesn't get soggy. I don't add the salsa, olives or green pepper (due to personal taste) and only use 1 big tomato and half a bag of pre-shredded lettuce. Love it!

This recipe serves quite a few people. I warmed it up in the oven until the cheese melted. It served 12 people at a tennis tournament, 8 people at a poker tournament later that night, and there was still enough for two of us the next day. Everybody loved it! Plus, the melted cheese on top made it easy to travel with without the worry of making a mess.

The next time I use this recipe I wont mix the sour cream with cream cheese. I like them separated. Also with the left overs since I had alot. I made some taco beef and then put then beef in the burrito and the 7-layer dip inside the burrito. Buttered the outside of the burrito and put it on the skillet. It was GREAT!

I made this for a tailgate party and it was a huge hit! As others suggested, I used a 9x13 aluminum tin and it fit perfectly. I left out the lettuce because it wilts but otherwise the recipe was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious.  But also very high.  It's a lot of food for sure.  It didn't all go at the party, however, I loved it and will use it again.  Perhaps make something a bit smaller so as to not get my feelings hurt.

If you really want to do something different with 7 layer dip, spread the bean mix and a layer of queso dip (old el paso has one ... there are others.. same sized jar as salsa) to the bottom of the pan. Stick that in the oven at 350 until it bubbles. add a layer of salsa, then sour cream then guac. i just add some diced red onions and diced tomatoes... grated cheese and shredded lettuce on top... mmmmm mmmmm!

Great recipe for taco dip! I used refried black beans. Very easy to make and was gone quick. Perfect for tailgaiting!

I added taco seasoning to the sour cream and the beans. It still needed more. I used taco cheese blend for the top. But, yet it was lacking flavor. I used some award winning hot salsa also. But, next time I will add more seasoning and buy a hotter salsa.

I wanted to make a taco dip after finding some at the local grocery store that was quite good, but when we went back for another one it was so runny.  This recipe was the first one I found and after reading the recipe and reviews I decided to make it for dinner.  Unfortunately my hubby didn't care for it, but my son loved it.  We used it as a baked potato topping, yum yum!  I made homemade guacamole to layer between the beans (which I heated in a pan before mixing in the taco seasoning) and the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  That is because my son can't have the dairy so I figured the guacamole would be a nice creamy substitute on his side of the dip.  His side of the dip also had goat cheese.  Other than that, there were no substitutions made, except I forgot the lettuce.  Thank you for this yummy dip, we will be taking it to our next fellowship meal at church!!

This is a fantastic recipe, I got it about 30 years ago from a friend in Lodi,Ca.  It is called Walking Tostada Dip.  The only difference was that it used only sour cream, bean dip and avocados along with the lettuce,tomatoes, olives,cheese and green onions sliced in 7 layers has been a hit for years and served with taco chips.

Absolutely fantastic.  This is the best 7 layer dip I have ever had.  I don't even like green onions and green peppers but it was fantastic.

WOW truly the best seven layer dip and so easy to make. The fresh veggies really make a difference. I took it to a football party last weekend and our friends loved it. I am making it again for another party this weekend.

I made this for the first time a few weeks ago for my mother in laws birthday, it was a HUGE hit and they all wanted the recipe. I did change one thing, I added the taco seasoning to the cream cheese and sour cream mixture instead of the beans. Delicious!!

I thought I would have left overs for sure, but after seeing the heaping amounts everyone took it was gone in about 25 mins!!  It was soooooo good.  Will make again.  I bought already cut up scallions, peppers, and tomatoes to make it even faster.  Excellent!

I didn't think this would be so good when I tasted the refried beans and the taco seasoning mixed together.  It was VERY salty, but after sitting in the fridge overnight it didn't seem salty at all.  Very delicious!

I added a layer of guacomole and also garnished with jalepenos.  My family loved this.  We only used 1/2 the sour cream and cream cheese mixture - saved the rest to put on baked potatoes.  I also used Amy's Vegetarian Refried Beans (no lard).

This was really good.  My 15 year old son made this using the "Taco Seasoning 1" from this site.  He also used guacamole and left out the lettuce.

I made this for a potluck today and it was gone in no time!!!! As suggested by others, I only use a little more than a half package of taco seasoning (matter of taste) and a thick and chunky salsa drained.  I was just delicious!!!! Very easy to make, not time consuming.

I have taken this dip to many parties, and I never come home with leftovers.  Never. It looks pretty in a trifle bowl -just be sure to add a serving spoon so guests can dig down through all the layers and not miss any of the goodie!

This was a recipe we used for our "Govenor's Ball" celebration after our classroom Oscars. It was cool and refreshing and easy to change the consistency as needed for all our friends.

My guests loved this!!! I didn't use the lettuce or sliced olives by personal preference. Also make sure to drain your salsa as much as possible because it can make it a little runny. My guests didn't seem to mind though!!!! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I make this all the time but I make it a little different. I mix the cream cheese w/ 2 Tablespoons taco seasoning mix and make that my first layer. Then I add 1 cup of guacamole mixed with rest of taco seasoning mix and make that my second layer. Then instead of refried beans I use canned bean dip. But as for everything else I do the same as whats printed on this recipe.

This dip is always a hit at our family gatherings! I recommend using a "hot" taco season to add extra flavor.

Very good dip, in fact I am replacing my old recipe for this one.  Love the cream cheese in with the sour cream.  I did change one thing, only because of my preference, and that was use less Taco seasoning then called for.

Very tasty!! Didn't use the bellpeppers, and added chopped white onions to the top. I doubled the recipe, but still used one package of taco seasoning. Would definitely make this again!

Great dip!!  As many others have said this was a HUGE hit.  Made a couple of modifications of the recipe as others have suggested and it came out great.  Added a layer of ground beef over the refried beans and also added a layer of avocado.  Baked it in the over for a few minutes to warm up and melt the cheese.

Everyone LOVES this recipe.  I also added taco seasoning to the taco meat.  I like homemade guacamole so that was also a nice way to sneak in spice.

Always a winner.  I never have to bring back extras.  Many ingredients can also be replaced with "healthier" alternatives, like reduced fat cream cheese, Fat free sour cream, reduced sodium taco seasoning, etc.  No one notices the difference.  Also, I never use lettuce or olives.  Thank you so much!

This is a great stand by appetizer that always disappears at a party.  I used a 8x11 glass pan which worked perfect and looked pretty.  I put the seasoning into the sour cream/cream cheese mixture and did not add the lettuce or olives just for our personal taste.  Quick, easy and perfect every time.

I love taco dips, but find some of them too spicy for my taste. With this recipe I was able to alter it to my taste by using mild salsa and mild taco seasoning. I also added a layer of ground beef over the refried beans that I made with taco seasoning as well. My boyfriend and I also like soft tacos, so I make the "dip" with the ground beef and then serve it with warm flour tortillas and spanish rice. That way everyone can put as much stuff in their soft tacos without 40 plates on the table.

I love making this recipe. Its fast, easy and is always devoured at parties. Tonight I am making it for a vegetarian crowd, but nomally I will add brown ground turkey or beef with the taco seasoning and use that as the first layer. Also, adding a layer of avacado/guacamole dip between the beans and sour cream is delish and looks pretty.

I made this recipe for the Super Bowl and it was a big hit!! I followed this recipe exactly as stated (except I left out the lettuce as suggested by other reviewers)and it was great. I have been asked to make this dip twice since the Super Bowl. It can be expensive to make, but it's so worth it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the best taco dip ever, and it was a huge hit at my families annual wreath making party.  The only changes I made was I excluded the lettuce cause it can get soggy, and the peppers and onion (only because I didn't have any) and I added guacamole.  It was great, I heated it up just enough to melt the cheese and I used tostitos scoops for the chip. The only thing I would change is drain the salsa a little cause it can get watery over a long period of time.

I made this for a superbowl party and was expecting to have extra because of all the food people bring.  The whole 9x13 pan was eaten and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again!  The only thing I would change next time is I wouldn't use lettuce because it wilts pretty quickly.  Excellent!

Excellent! Left out the green peppers due to personal taste, but everything else was kept the same! Was gone just as soon as I put it out for a Super Bowl party. A definite keeper!

I make a layer dip similar to this and it is always a favorite at parties! I use a small cookie sheet and layer these ingredients.  1 can refried beans 1/2 lg container sour cream mixed with 1/2 packet taco seasoning quacamole I make with 3-4 avacados mixed in the food processor with a couple TBS Olive oil and a few squeezes of lime juice salsa (black bean/corn, cilantro, any kind you like..) 1 can drained rinsed black beans if not in salsa 1/2-1 packet mexican shredded cheese  sliced olives, diced tomatoes, lettuce to garnish I have used tried mixing the cream cheese like this recipe calls for but I couldn't tell the difference with it included.

This was quite delicious. I made it for the Superbowl and was very easy to make. We did not have alot of people over, so next time I will cut the recipe in half unless I have more people.

I made this for a superbowl party I hosted. While other appetizers sat there this one was scraped clean!!! I would recommend using a stronger tortilla chips like the scoops because they tend to break when getting to the bottom of the layers.

We tried this for the Super Bowl and it was very good! I think next time I would use half of the taco seasoning, simply because I like the taste of the beans more. Instead of the tomato and lettuce layers I did LuvAnn's fresh guacamole. While i completely LOVE this guac it doesn't stay good on the dip for long. I wouldn't make it in hope of a snack for several days, it is definitely meant to be eaten right away. It fits into a 9x13 dish very well, but you could half it into an 8x8 I think. I put more beans in it because the amount of beans was really small to the amount of cream cheese and sour cream. They were not even close amounts. Other then that this dip was a huge hit. People ate so much that they weren't hungry for the pizza later!

love this dip- only things that I do different is too add hamburger to beans, use taco sauce instead of salsa, and to cut out the inside of tomato and use only the flesh part so that my lettuce doesn't wilt.

I love seven layer dip! I used this as a foundation. I seasoned the sour cream with the taco seasoning instead of the beans and I used red taco sauce instead of salsa. It was excellent!

Made this for Super Bowl-it's really, really good!  The cream cheese is the key ingredient for sure.  I used seasoned ground beef on the bottom layer and omitted the peppers & lettuce.  Will definatley make again!

This was ok, not the best ever. Too much taco seasoning in the refried beans. I left off the lettuce. Probably won't make again.

This recipe is always a party favorite!  Like others, I add ground beef to the bean/taco seasoning mix and I leave out the guacamole and tomato/green pepper.  But it overflows in my dish and I never have leftovers!!  I also mix the cheese with one cup cheddar, one cup taco blend to give it a punch.  Always a winner!!

Touchdown!  I served this on Superbowl Sunday and it was excellent.  Use a jelly roll pan with sides or similar size platter.  It's better than the traditional "taco dip" type recipes.

Just made three batches of this for tomorrow's big game.  I left out the lettuce and the chives, but added some sliced pickled jalapenos on top for those of us who like it spicy.   It was difficult not to rip open a bag of chips and dig right in, but once you start on this, there is no stopping until it is all gone.

I brought this to a soccer party and it was a hit!!!  Everyone loved it and was finished half way through the party.  The only items I didn't put in was the lettuce and olives.  I am going to make this on Superbowl Sunday.  Can't wait to eat some more.  I would recommend this appetizer to everyone.

I made this a little while ago. It was pretty good, but a little watery. I skipped the pepper and tomato since we didn't have any and I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chillies and drained it, but I guess not well enough. I also skipped the olives. It was yummy warm or cold. Will probably try again for another party! UPDATE!! I tried this with just the taco seasoning, beans, cream cheese, sour cream, and cheddar cheese and it's WAY better!  People at the party I went to loved it much better this way. I honestly dont care if its not as healthy. Parties aren't supposed to be healthy--people eat what they want!

I love this recipe and am always asked to bring this dip to parties! I usually top it with green olives and jalapenos since I don't like black olives. I also like to serve it with Tostitos gold chips or something "strong" since it's a thick and heavy dip and some chips tend to break easily.

Excellent. I skipped the peppers because I don't like them and I left out the chopped tomato and lettuce because I was taking it to work and was afraid that it would get too soggy. Everyone raved about it and several people asked me for the recipe.

I made this for my son's birthday party!  It was a hit!  I did use a 13x9 because it made a large quantity.  Also, instead of using taco mix with the refried beans, I just purchased spicy jalapeno refried beans!  They were great.  To keep the lettuce from wilting...I just applied the last few ingredients right before serving!

Oh wow, this was DELICIOUS!  It's my new staple dip.  I didn't use lettuce, tomatoes or peppers.  I also put half a packet of taco seasoning in with the beans and half a packet of Fiesta Ranch seasoning mix with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  I want to make more just thinking about it!

I gave this 5 stars even though I changed the recipe.  I did not use lettuce, green peppers or black olives. I did however use guacamole that I made with an easy simple guacamole spicy mix pack and 2 fresh avocados.  I did how ever do the beans how you said but when it came to the sour cream/ cream cheese mix I missed a layering step and so I ended up just mixing the sour cream, cream cheese and salsa all together than put the shredded chedder cheese on top here is how I layered mine beans, guacamole, salsa sour cream mix shredded  it was a hit! EVERYONE kept saying how much they loved it! Will make this again for sure!!

Very good recipe.  I liked the way it presents in a glass dish with the layers, but it is difficult to get you chip through all of the layers.  If you do prepare it this way, I suggest using a spoon to serve.  Next time I will try making it in a 9x13 pan.  I added a layer of store bought guacamole and used seasoned refried beans.

Everyone at the dinner party raved about how wonderful this was but they barely made a dent in it. I thought it was wonderful. However, it made way too much and I am not sure how you could cut it down. I liked the lettuce on there when it was fresh but by the time we were eating leftovers (which there were a lot of them), the lettuce was a little bit nasty. I would suggest leaving it off.

This is my first time doing a review and this recipe deserves my 5 stars!! Everything in the recipe just goes together so well. I took this dish to a New Years Eve party and it was a BIG hit. Everyone was coming up to me telling me they loved it and how good it was. I did NOT alter the recipe at all. There is no need to. It is great the way it is! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I will be making this again for sure!

My husband saw something like this in the store so I told him I would make it for him. I found this recipe and decided to try it. He loves it! And so do I. It's really good and wasn't hard to make at all. I had some left over chopped up onions so I added them in and thought about adding mex. rice but didn't have any on hand. Definately will be making this again!

This is a great recipe, I've brought it to many get togethers and have been asked for the recipe. I don't add the lettuce as it does wilt and I've added the taco mix to the sour cream mixture. I've also made the sour cream mix the night before and the flavore seem to really be brought out. I'll be serving this dip again in a few hours for a New Years day party. Enjoy!

This recipe makes a TON of dip.  But in the end - it's seven layer dip.  You can pretty much do whatever you want to it and people will like it.  Great for tailgating or football games.

Everybody loves this.  As others have suggested, we replaced the lettuce and tomato with LuvAnn's Guacamole.  One night, we made this in lieu of dinner and sat around the TV chowing down; yummy.

Yummy!  I made a couple of modifications the biggest of which was that I added a can of drained whole kernel corn.  Great recipe!  Super quick and easy to prepare.  Will definitely make this again!

Very yummy and quickly gone. This was a smash for a recent birthday party! I made it using low-fat/fat-free cheeses/sour cream so it was pretty healthy too:-)

Very good! It looks pretty. I didn't add the green peppers (didn't have any) and instead of black olives (i personally don't care for them) I put some black beans on top. So good. The cream cheese adn sour cream mix makes it a little different from the typical layered dip. No leftovers after a church picnic.

I simplified this quite a bit and it was still delidious- just seasoning and beans on the bottom, cream cheese and nonfat plain yogurt in the middle, salsa on top. Sprinkled some shredded cheese and olives on it...guests devoured it!

Awesome recipe!  This is SOOOO good and looks great for a party if you put it in a trifle dish as pictured.  To make it a little lower in fat I used low-fat cream cheese, sour cream and cracker barrel 2% cheddar cheese.  It was wonderful and everyone loved it!  The leftovers the next day were great too.

I'd never had a taco dip before, and this one was really tasty. I followed the package instructions on the taco seasoning and cooked hamburger meat with it. I couldn't find refried beans, so I just used a can of pinto beans mashed up. I mixed the mashed up beans with the taco-seasoned hamburger meat. That was my bottom later. On top of that, I added cheese, then the sour cream and cream cheese mixture. Then I added the green onions and salsa (which I strained to remove most of the juice) and the chopped tomatoes. I left out the green peppers because the salsa I used already had green peppers in it. I also left out the black olives just because I don't like them. I thought I would like this dip better warm, so I put it in a 350 degree oven just until the dip was warm/cheese was melted. Then I added finely chopped lettuce to the top. It was quite delicious. I heated some up the next day just until it was warm, and I thought it was still quite tasty. Yes, the pieces of lettuce were warm, but the pieces were so small and the whole thing was so tasty that I didn't really notice that I was eating warm lettuce. I notice a lot of reviewers have left the lettuce off over wilting concerns... but I think the lettuce added a lot to this dip. Who cares if it becomes wilted? Once your guests taste this dip, I highly doubt anyone is going to be worried about the appearance of the lettuce.

I made this recipe exactly as it was, and it was a HIT.  The lettuce DID wilt the next day when we finished the leftovers, but I don't think leftovers are going to be something we'll have to worry about.  DEFINITELY will make this again!

This was absolutely marvelous.  I did change a couple things, instead of canned refried beans, I made them myself. I also reduced the cream cheese and sour cream mixture by half and it was perfect!  I prepared this for dinner.  We had shredded beef burritos with the dip and chips.  Boy was this a hit!!! Thank you much!!

This is absolutely fabulous.  I made it as described, aside from using low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.  I also skipped the green peppers because they are not my favourite.  I had been concerned that the lettuce would get soggy but based on some of the positive comments about the lettuce, I kept it in. I'm glad I did!  It was yummy and made it a bit different. 

It makes a huge amount and I did have the thought that since I had leftovers, maybe I shouldn't have put the lettuce in it, as now it would be soggy and the leftovers might go to waste.  I opened it up this afternoon (the party was yesterday) to see if I could pick out the lettuce and still enjoy the dip.

To my surprise the lettuce is STILL crispy, not in the slightest bit soggy.  I had made a point to spin it in the salad spinner first before putting it on the dip though I thought surely it would absorb the moisture from the salsa.  it didn't, the dip is great even as leftovers, had some for lunch without chips - just on a fork.  Yum!

This was a definite winner with the crowd! I did some changes as others did. Here is my version;

Recipe Alterations:
 
Omitted: tomato, olives, lettuce, bell pepper
 
1). brown 1lb hamburger - mix in refried beans and half of the taco seasoning mix
2), add a layer of guacamole
3). used mango/pineapple salsa (really can use whatever flavor you want)
4). added a layer of mild chopped chilis (sm can)
5). instead of chopped tomato used a can of Rotel chopped tomatos and chilis
6). mixed the other half of the taco seasoning mix with the cream cheese and sour cream
7). used green onions as garnish on top of the cheese
 
Order of layers starting with:
 
burger/beans
guacamole
sour cream/cream cheese
chilis
salsa
cheddar
green onions

THE BEST! I too left out the lettuce and replaced it with a mixed layer of guacamole and green onion.  I also split the seasoning mix between the beans and cream combo and left out the green pepper too. I received RAVE reviews and it was gone within about 15 mins.  I spread the layers on a large serving bowl/platter and it worked out perfectly!  It was so easy to make!!!

I was a little concerned because the tomatoes + salsa threw a lot of water and I thought it looked kind of runny when people started to dig in. I went to take a look about 10 minutes later and the whole dish was devoured so apparently no one cared! It was fantastic as is however I will skip the tomatoes next time and just use a chunky salsa instead. Otherwise was delicious and people were raving over it.

It was gobbled up at the party where I brought it.  GOBBLED!  The salsa did make it runny and messy, so I think I will make it in a bowl or trifle dish next time.

I made this just for my husband and I and we couldn't stop eating it! I left out the lettuce and green peppers, just our personal preference, and made homemade gaucamole. I really liked putting the taco seasoning into the beans. Thanks for a great recipe!

This turned out really good.   I omitted a couple of things, ran out of run in my dish.  The only complaint that i had, was that after a couple of hours there was some extra water.  I did make this the day before.

this dip was good, although i didnt add the olives. i think it would be better if you melted the cheese first before all the veggies were added on.

I made this recipe for the first time for a party and it was a total hit!!! In fact, my guests ate all of it and I had to make a second batch the next day so my husband could have some! Even without the black olives, it's great!!! Even better at room temp!

Excellent!  I wouldn't suggest using a 13x9 pan though b/c the layer of beans will be way too thin.  I used a big bowl and even with that, I may add an extra can of beans next time.  This is wonderful, awesome flavor.  Thanks so much!

This dip was very easy to make!  I served mine in a very large clear glass bowl so you could really see all of the layers.  I took it to a super bowl party and didn't understand why nobody was eating it, my food is normally the first to go.  I finally said something and everyone agreed it was to pretty to eat.  Once the first person dug in it was ALL gone!

Great dip. I changed it a little, I added ground turkey to the beans (like ground beef but healthier).  I also used spicy refried beans and some hot sauce to give it a little more spice.  I also omitted olives since I don't like them.  I did not use guacamole since it can turn brown if left too long but that would be really good with it.

Very yummy! I omitted the green pepper and diced tomato, but I doubled the refried beans and taco seasoning and poured the whole big container (24oz) of Pace thick and chunky salsa in. I used a huge Corning Ware dish (I think it is 11x13) to accommodate the extra volume. It was a big hit at my latest party!

My sister makes this dip all the time and it's just amazing. After she made it for my birthday this year, a friend of mine hounded me for the recipe for months. I'm finally making my own version (without the peppers!) today... coincidentally, on my sister's birthday.

Made this for my superbowl party and it was a hit.  I used Chicken Taco mix as that's all I had.  I didn't use the lettuce because I was afraid it would get soggy.  I also used a can tomato with jalepeno.  Will definitely make again, maybe next time with guacamole.

Great appetizer.  I followed recipe exactly (except I omitted the olives because I don't like them) and it turned out great.  I put leftovers in the refrigerator and lettuce was fine the next day.  Will definitely make again.  Second time I made it I added a layer of taco meat on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer.  I think I like it better with the meat.

based on another friend's recipe, i used mayo instead of cream cheese, which was very scarey, but it turned out great. I took it to a super bowl party and the platter was scraped clean. 

i will try it with cream cheese one day, but it seems there's no way to ruin this one!

Wow, this dip was incredible! Everyone at the superbowl party loved it and I got in trouble when I ran out of chips with dip still remaining! I omitted olives and used low fat sour cream - still amazing.
I plan on making it again this weekend!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made it for our Super Bowl party yesterday and it was a huge hit.  To make it a little healthier, I used an 8 oz container of lite sour cream and 1/2 container of Philadelphia whipped cream cheese.

I made this recipe in about 20 minutes.  I left out green peppers because of preference but got RAVE reviews at the party I took it to.  I have added it to my party list of foods to quickly prepare and to print out the recipe to pass along :-)

This was a very easy recipe to put together and quite tasty.  I needed something quick for a party I was going to and put this together in under 30 mins.  I omitted the green peppers, but everyone thought it was great!  I used fresh salsa. Will definitely make again!  TY!

You can't go wrong with this one. I like it with guacamole but I have noticed if you don't put that in more people eat it. Don't ask me why but it is true. I also don't use lettuce or green pepper but I add extra onions and black olives.

I make a recipe very similar to this every year, it is a huge hit.  
I place a layer of refried beans on the bottom of a deep serving platter, than I mix a packet of taco seasoning mix into a tub of sour cream and that is the next layer, followed by lettuce, tomato, shredded mexican cheese, scallions and than diced black olives.  Everyone loves this dip!!!

It was good, ommited the lettuce. It really needed to be spicier though. No better, no worse than many other similar dips I have had.

Really good dip.  I subbed a can of rotel in place of chopping tomatoes and a green pepper.   I left out the lettuce because it was a REALLY hot day and the picnic was outside.  I made guacamole and added that as a layer instead.

I made this last night for my New Year's Eve party, and it was a hit!  I made it in a 7x11 dish, and used 8 oz sour cream and about 6 oz of whipped cream cheese.  Then I spread the salsa over that, sprinkled on chopped tomato and lettuce, and then topped with colby jack cheese, and drizzled a generous helping of catalina dressing over the top, a la "taco salad".  I served it with Tostitos Scoops and everyone loved it!  Thanks for the keeper recipe!

Wow, This was a big hit....for three days. I made this for some friends who stopped by for an adult beverage and everyone loved the dip. I used just a bit less olives and didn't use lettuce. I am going to try and cut down on the cream cheese the next time. I will keep you all posted. WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!

This recipe is great. The presentation is beautiful too. I took this to a party and it got gobbled up. People remarked about how good it looked. The only thing I changed was I added ground beef to the taco seasoning mix after browning. Using the same bowl as in the picture and it sat atop a plate of regular tortilla triangles and the scoops kind also. DLH

Overall, this was pretty good.  My only problem was that it turned out a tad bit  runny.  My only suggestion, is to make sure you use a very chunky salsa.

Great for parties! I used canned green jalapeno peppers and red onion instead. I think next time I won't use the food processor to mix the cream cheese and sour cream because it got a little too liquidy.

I made homemade salsa and guacamole and it made the dip very fresh tasting. I also ommitted the bell pepper, as I do not care for the taste. Finally, I did not use lettuce as I thought it would wilt easily. With these modifications, the dip turned out terrific. I will make this again!

Served this at a party, everyone tried it and liked it. I added a layer of guacamole and left out the lettuce and diced peppers. Would make again.

I served this taco dip at a football game get together at our home, and got wonderful reviews! However, I did make several changes. I added store-bought guacamole in the center layer (before I topped the salsa on) and added chopped cilantro and some jalapeno peppers on the  layer after the diced tomatoes (instead of green peppers). I thought that really "salsa-sized" the taco dip and the cilantro added a yummy tang to the dip. Make sure you use thick/chunky salsa. I used homemade salsa with homegrown tomatoes and it was a little watery than store-bought, so there was a little pool of water in the middle of the dip. That was my own doing though, so I still think this recipe is a real keeper!

Best taco dip I ever had.  It was a big hit at the party I took it to.  The only thing I'll do different that I read that another viewer had done was beat the taco seasoning with the sour cream and cream cheese rather then with the refried beans.  I think that will work better.  Even still, a great dip, and I'll definately make this again and again!

this one is hard to mess up. I usually mix up the taco seasoning mix with some of the sour cream or cream cheese to give it some flavor. I dont use lettuce, maybe because here in Phoenix I am afraid it will wilt if left out.This recipe you can add things as you like..green chiles, cilantro, flavored refried beans,different flavors of salsa etc. A nice good basic recipe. I like the added touch of cream cheese.

Wonderful.  It made so much dip though that I put it in two containers and my party of about 18 people didn't even finish half of it.  The only thing I did differently is that I left out the olives because I don't really care for them.

My friend showed me this recipe two years ago and I couldn't stop eating it! It does make a lot, so for home I just do 1/2 but for parties I put the whole thing on a large plastic platter(about 18 inches wide) this makes it much easier to scoop out.

I left out the olives (because I hate them!) and the tomatoes (because my friends hate them!) and the recipe turned out great!  I did substitute guacamole before the lettuce to keep the "seven" layers!

This is a super dip!!  I left out the lettuce and olives.  Next time I may try a layer of avocado as others recommended. I put it in a 4" glass pan and it looked very nice.  I will definately be making this again, thanks!

I have used this recipe as a guideline twice. The first time I just added some new spices to it and it was a hit. The second time I added a pound of browned lean ground hamburger meat and some spices and we thought it was much better with that. Again this dip was a hit. I will use this recipe many times again per say.

I made this for a potluck and it didn't take long for the dish to be emptied completely!  It takes several bowls to get all the layers assembled but the end result is worth the dirty dishes!  I will make this often.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and it made it 5 star - I did not put green peppers in this, although my husband said it would be great so i'll give it a try next time I make this.  I made my own guac and layered it ontop of the salsa/tomato layer.  My husbands friend always made "the best" 7layaer dip, but this blew that out of the water!

Everyone loves this taco dip!  I modified the recipe and replaced the sour cream with guacamole.  Absolutely delicious.  There is never anything left when I bring this to a party. It's my go-to recipe for any group gathering.

Made this for a work food thing and everyone LOVED it, there was not a bit left and I had requests for the recipe. I left out the green peppers and onions because I don't like them and didn't need nearly as much sour cream and cream cheese and I only used 1/2 the packet of seasoning but it was plenty spicy. I served it with Tostitos new FLOUR tortilla chips and it was great!

I made this and took it to work.  Everyone loved it.  Many of the women asked for the recipe saying that "this was much better than the one they make."
I was requested that I go make more "right now".  I will be make this again soon.

Perfect, had to give out several copies of the recipe.  I added a layer of guacamole and made sure I drained the salsa and added the taco mix to the sour cream instead of the beans.  This his the spot and is impressive to take to  a party.

Of course this was awesome!  How could it not be w/ all of those Tex-Mex ingredients put into one dish? ;)  I would make no changes/additions to this recipe b/c it's perfect as is.

Tasty!  I omit the cream cheese just because I hate working with cream cheese (I like the taste, but both the texture and the smell irritate me).  Just as tasty!

This is good, looks pretty, and was eaten up by the group of men and women in our card group.  I used low fat cheese, sour cream and cream cheese and no one was any the wiser. I thought it needed more kick and would increase the mexican spices for more flavor next time.  More chile powder, onion powder, cumin. I arranged giant sliced black olives on the top as the finish, and it really did look quite nice.

I was asked to bring a Seven Layer Dip to our family get together.  Looked up couple different recipes found this one and thought why not.  Really glad I did.  GREAT recipe!!  Family couldn't get enough of it.  I did take a suggest from other reviewer and used LuvAnn's Guacamole on bean layer.  Next time I'll use something bigger than my 9x13.  (Harrah, OK)

Made this for an office "pot luck" and everyone went wild over it!! Great recipe! I did ommit the bell pepper and I drained the salsa so it wasn't watery but other than that made as directed and it turned out great.

This recipe is great! I made it for a girls night at my house and everyone raved!! I did omit the green pepper (which I am not a big fan of) and the lettuce, and I added some guacamole. I will definitely make this again!!

I made it exactly like the recipe called for and it was ok, but I think I will make some changes next time. I did drain the salsa a little bit like someone else had recommended and I think that helped a bit but I think I will maybe add some meat next time and omit the green peppers. This is one of those recipes that you can change to your taste.

I thought this was okay, nothing really exciting. I put the seasoning in the sour cream and omited the lettuce. It makes a ton and next time I will layer it in a bowl instead of a plate.

Good but made some changes which is why I didn't give it 5 *. Browned turkey meat instead of refried beans with cumin, adobo, chili powder. Added cumin and chili powder to cream cheese/sour cream as well. Perfect for a party, use the scoops tortillas so its easy to eat!

excellent as usual!  It was devoured by all! I haven't made for years since it seems so "overdone" wherever you go. Our personal preference is to skip the beans, and add taco meat.

This recipe is so easy,quick,and tastes so GOOD...I served this with White Tortilla chips.You can omit the cream cheese,if you want.Or can add 1/2 lb fried hamburger or mild sausage,on top of the bean layer.This recipe can also be used as filling for soft taco or barrito shells...All my family LOVED this.I will make this again,and it will be added to one of MY family favorites!

Nothing spectacular. Easy to make. Your basic 7-layer dip. People liked it but it wasn't a sensation. Not sure we'll make it again.

We LOVE this. Perfect poker night munchies b/c it's a whole lotta food that holds up well for hours. I tried to give this some heat by using refried beans with chiles and a medium salsa. Used ground beef with 1/2 the amount of taco seasoning I used with the beans. I also sprinkled  a tiny bit of jalepenos instead of the green peppers. I'd make this again and again,and again. Thanks for such a delicious recipe.

Very yummy. I was alittle iffy in the sour cream & cream cheese, but it was really good. i used 1 (30 oz.) can of vegetrian refried beans due to friends eating habits. Also I used romaine lettuce.  It was very good the next day.

I changed the recipe around a bit to fit my friend's tastes, and now they love it! This is a very tasty, easy-to-make recipe that fits in at almost any occasion.

This was very good, I some what made some changes however. I left out the Cream Cheese and Green Pepper all together as Green Peppers have a tendency to overwhelm certain recipes. Otherwise it was the same. This is great for work snack day.

Loved it--it's the ultimate party taco dip. The chili/bean mixture gives it great flavor and the cream cheese/sour cream layer was much lighter than other recipes I've tried. I might add hot sauce to the bean mixture next time for some kick. Great recipe!

Really lovely, went down well, flavours are great. I did make the night before required so ommitted the lettuce and layered in a large dish although it didn't spread at all. Thankyou for a tasty dip recipe.

Absolutely awesome dip.  I took this to my family's Super Bowl fiesta and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make this dip again.  I did leave out the onions as a personal preference, but it turned out great.  Thank you!

We had a going away party for a couple moving to Maine.  I decided to try something new, and this seven layer taco dip was a success.  I was asked for the recipe by a some of the people that were there.

Leaving out the onions made it possible for everyone to enjoy this dip, there is so much flavor in this dip that the onions weren't even missed.

So I skipped the tomato and lettuce, drained salsa as suggested and it was great. I got lots of compliments. One advice - use a large bowl or deep dish, seriously - the larger the better.

This turned out great! I didn't use a green pepper (only because I forgot to buy one at the store), and I did use about a can and a half of beans, and got lots of compliments! This was a quick and easy appetizer to make and I will definitely be making it again!

A great mexican dip recipe.  I like to change the veggies from time to time just to keep it interesting, but a great base.  I never take home any leftovers.

WOW! I served this dip for my daughter's "fiesta" themed birthday party and it went over amazingly! I had none left halfway through the day! This is a keeper :)

this is a family favorite here as well...for the smaller kids i make a version using taco sauce instead of salsa and they loves there's as much as the adults.

This makes quite a bit of dip, so it's great for a BBQ with some friends. It's also tasty and versatile!

Fantastic recipe. Like other reviewers, I did not add the tomatoes, felt the salsa was enough.  And I mixed a half a pack of taco seasoning in with the sour cream/cream cheese mix.  It was delicious, will use again.

I made this for a large family dinner and EVERYBODY loved it!!  That's hard to do in a big family of picky eaters. Definately recommend this to others - it was fast and easy to put together.

This was pretty good- it went over well at a dinner that we had at our home last week- not much leftovers for 12 people. I added some taco seasoning and cumin to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture though, because it seemed like it was missing something. I used green leaf lettuce, because it was all that I had, but I think that iceburg would have been better for this recipe. Thank you for the recipe!

WONDERFUL!  I made this for my boyfriend's sake because he LOVES seven layer dip, but I think I ended up eating more of it than he did!  I just can't stop eating it!  The taco seasoning packet I had was 1.25 ounces which I think ended up being a little bit too much...so I think next time I will look for the suggested 1-ounce packet.  I used fat free refried beans, fat free cream cheese, and light sour cream.  I LOVED the cream cheese/sour cream mixture...I normally HATE sour cream, but this combo made it edible for me!  I added a layer of guacamole after the sour cream layer (Easy Guacamole from this site) and omitted the bell pepper and lettuce.  I only used half of the recommended amount of sour cream & cream cheese, as well as salsa (I originally planned on only making half recipe...so that's what I bought ingredients for) and will probably continue to do this in the future.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I made this for the first footy game of the season and it was a hit!  I didn't use the peppers or olives so I made some guacamole to use instead. Thanks for the great recipe. It will be made again for sure.

This was pretty good, I skipped out on the lettuce, went less on the SCream and CreamChs. THIS WILL NOT stay nice in the fridge over night. Most likely, prepare it right before eating. Add some Jalepenos to the top and it makes it extra spicy. DO NOT get HOT Taco Seasoning, it is wayyyy too hot for the recipe and over-powers the ingredients. Awesome dip, addicting....

This is a great recipe.  I have had requests even when I am invited to a party and not hosting to bring this dip!  

I would make it in a shallow pan though, so you can be sure to scoop the dip out easily.

Great! Easy & quick to whip together. For a healthier twist use reduced sodium seasoning mix, fat free cream cheese, plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and spinach instead of lettuce.

This IS the best! I was a little skeptical of all the vegetables, but I only put them on half for the picky eaters. This was devoured at a Halloween party.. the best party was the bottom layer of beans with taco seasoning. Thanks for a keeper!

This was really good and makes a party sized recipe! It definitely needs to be made in a 9x13 pan or a large platter. Also, I only had a quarter the sour cream/cream cheese I needed, and know it would have been better with more. Excellent!

Very yummy, even with a few changes.  I didn't use all of the sour cream or cream cheese (I thought it would overpower) and I accidentally left off the lettuce.  It was so good without the lettuce that I'm purposely leaving it off this time.  Still, it was devoured.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe as is and this dip was great!  I was a little nervous about adding the green pepper, but I'm glad I decided not to skip it.  It added a nice flavor and texture to the dip.  I had about 20 friends over the other night and they devoured every bit of it.  The dip was so good, everyone came back for seconds and thirds!  This is now my new favorite recipe for get-togethers.  (Oh...I did make one change...I used green leaf lettuce instead of iceberg, just because it looks and tastes better.)

We loved this dip!!! BRILLIANT!! and it was still great the next day.  The only thing I did do different is used taco seasoned cheese (Mexican style) and used Rosita Green chili with lime juice beans.  thanks

This recipe was awesome! I made it for a Mexican Night with friends and it went over well, even with her nine year old daughter! We left the green peppers out, but I'm sure that they would have been a great addition (we just forgot to add them!) I will definitely be making this again.

This dip was awesome!  Easy to make and VERY tasty.  I served it with Tostito chips, but will offer a chip variety with the next batch.

Easy, fast and will be something everyone will keep eating and eating (I felt guilty it was so easy and fast).  I used Rosarito's jalapeno refried beans and a 'hot' taco seasoning packet -still wasn't that hot but gave it a kick and everyone, including wimps, liked it.  The sour cream and cream cheese combo was great; it made the sour cream hold up and not become soupy.   Everything mixed together and tasted great.  I put it in a clear Pyrex 8"x5" pan and it looked great.  Served it with Frito's Scoops.

This was a hit at my work potluck!  Many compliments and people asking for the recipe!!  I used fat-free beans, sour cream and cream cheese to make it a little bit less guilty for me, but was wonderful!!!

Very Good, but I made the mistake of putting it on a plate, and covering it wil saran wrap.  It would probably be better to put on something that has sides, pie pan . . . etc.  But a great hit with my husband and friends.

This recipe is easy to make and very much worth doing. It was a huge hit at a bridal shower I took it to and not one bite was left. This dip is a keeper and I'll be making this again VERY soon.

Very good and simple appetizer Sue...not to mention popular.  To accomidate others we left out the cream cheese, sour cream and green peppers.  These are normally "personal preference" items and don't hurt the overall out come of the finished product if left out.  We spread guacamole on top and it turned out great.
