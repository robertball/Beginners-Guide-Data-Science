I made this for Christmas dinner; it was fantastic! I modified by doubling pudding mixture, and adding nutmeg and cinammon to the whip cream. Also, I couldn't find a gingerbread cake mix so I used a spice cake, and added ground ginger and molasses to it and it tasted just like gingerbread. I also made a praline and crumbled it-anyone that wanted it added some on top of thier trifle. Don't add it before or it won't be crunchy! It was a great addition with a bit of crunch. Definitely will make this one again!

I am not great with guessing volume - so I measured. For presentation this recipe requires a 10 cup bowl to fill to the brim.

I used light eggnog and Cool Whip for this and we absolutely loved it!  I also garnished this with a row of gingersnap cookies around the edge right before serving.  It looked really pretty, plus it was delicious.

AMAZING!!!!!  I followed others suggestions and I added molasses and ginger to a spice cake mix and then I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the whipped cream.  So very, very good and so perfect for the holidays. It may be my new go to dish!

This was good but the eggnog was a little overpowering. I think next time I make it I will use half eggnog and half milk for the pudding.

This recipe is excellent!    I made this for a holiday potluck and took home Best Dessert prize!

I tweaked the recipe a bit, instead of using dried cranberries to add color and offset the sweetness of the gingerbread and eggnog pudding, I made a quick raspberry sauce/compote to add between each layers.  I placed store brought mini gingerbread cookies around the inside of the bowl to add a touch of holiday whimsy.   So simple to make and very very tasty!

This is REALLY very, very tasty. I brought an empty bowl home from the company Christmas party. I love the eggnog pudding, and next time I might double the pudding part because it was so good.

LOVED this!  I made it for Christmas Day and those who liked it REALLY liked it.  The eggnog is such a great creamy contrast to the spicy gingerbread.  I didn't use the cranberries or cookie crumbs but I think next year I'll garnish with those Pepperidge Farm gingerbread men cookies on top.  Thank you!

My family was laughing at my excitement over my new trifle dish, but they have all asked for this one again!  This is the perfect combination of ingredients.  I made as is and it was very good!  I will make it every Christmas.

Really great holidy trifle recipe.  Instead of using a gingerbread cake mix, I used the spice cake mix because 1) I couldn't find a gingerbread cake mix, and 2) my family is not the greatest lovers of gingerbread - but we do love egg nog!  It turned out really good though with the spice cake.  Yummy - definitely keeping this one with my holiday recipes.

I made this for friends visiting from PA who love gingerbread.  It was a hit.  Made double gingerbread so I have another batch for Thanksgiving.  I used CoolWhip instead of whipping cream just for the convenience but next batch will have the cream.    I am toying with the idea of incorporating Amaretto into it somehow.  I'm just saying that might be pretty good.

I made this for a family gathering this weekend. Everyone gobbled it up.  The only thing I will change the next time I make this is to leave off the cranberry's.  They don't do anything for this dish. I will be making this again.

This was yummy! Awesome dessert to serve over the holidays to a large group! I improvised a few things… Used a spice cake mix (reduced water to 1-cup+2-tbsp, added ½-cup molasses, 2-tsp of ginger… In the future I may try substituting orange juice for some of the water) baked in 11x15 pan for 28-min at 325 in convection. I used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding mix (one small box, one large box = 5-cups) made with 3-cups of eggnog and 2-cups of milk. The pudding would be too thick and strong tasting with all eggnog... I may use 6-cups of pudding next time. I whipped 4-cups of whipping cream with 2/3-cup of brown sugar, 1-tsp of cinnamon, 1/8-tsp of nutmeg. I layered this masterpiece into very large trifle bowl into 3 layers (cake, pudding, whip cream). On the top layer I crushed 4 Skor bars and sprinkled them on top right before serving (skipped the cookies and cranberries). It was amazing.

We used a carrot cake mix instead of gingerbread.  This was delicious!  We kicked it up a notch with Kahlua, next time we will try spiced rum!

I love experimenting with all different types of trifles.  This trifle was the perfect Christmas dessert.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I added a layer of Andes mints (baking section) as well as a thin layer of ground up ginger snaps.  My family and guests absolutely loved it.  The perfect happy ending to a special day.

Love this recipe! I can't cook, and now I have a holiday dessert people request! My changes: 1/2 tblsp vanilla, 1 1/2 tblsp bourbon (in the whipped cream). I also added a crushed-up Heath bar to the top of each layer.

This is a real showstopper of a dessert, and ridiculously easy and mistake-proof IF you leave it in the fridge overnight. One year, I only let it sit 8 hours and it was just 3 totally separate layers -- boring and uninspired and no one got excited about it. *** You need to let it sit overnight!!!***

Every year I make this, and I get big raves on it --- more than on almost any other dessert I make. You can use different cakes for the cake part: I've done spice cake and gingerbread cake, both very good, and I make the cakes myself  because it's barely more work than buying a box. 

I've used Chef John's gingerbread cake recipe from this website (without the lemon glaze, obviously) and can recommend it, but suggest you double the spices if you make it.

Awesome!  Went over very well at my party.  Even a friend who doesn't care for eggnog but loves Gingerbread said it was really good.  I had another friend that had 3 servings.

Tasty dessert!  I used spice cake like others since gingerbread cake mix is no where to be found.  The eggnog flavor was a little strong so I think I may try and cut that down a bit if I make it again.  It was still very good though....and easy!

I thought this was awesome!  Don't bother to eat it the first day - it will be just so-so.  The next day, after the flavors have had time to meld, it's much better!  I used lowfat eggnog, and my pudding was not runny at all (will do that again!).  To save time (and fat), I used an 8-oz. tub of Lite Cool Whip (which means, omit the sugar and vanilla) - worked just fine!  Gingerbread cookie crumbs on top made it look so pretty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit. Everyone wants the recipe. Like some other reviewers, I made a spice cake rather than gingerbread because that was what I found in the store. Only thing I would change is I think I will use two small packets of pudding and add 4 cups of eggnog. I thought it was a little lacking in pudding. Not enough to keep everyone from scarfing it down!

Simply delicious! I used Cool Whip to save time, but did add the vanilla flavoring to it first.  Served these up in wine glasses with thinner layers of gingerbread cake.  Easy and impressive.

This is fantastic recipe - pretty, simple and festive.  The pudding was too thick so I added some milk to thin it. I did three layers of gingerbread, pudding and whipped cream instead of just two because it looks even more fancy.  I only used half the sugar because the eggnog pudding is so sweet.  I also omitted the cranberries just because I like a cleaner look.

This looks beautiful and tastes good - if you like the flavours, of course.  I agree that the eggnogg is a little too strong and so will reduce that part in future, but my guests loved it and my hubby thought it was 'ok'.  So mixed reviews, but all in all, tasty!

This was deeeelicious! I made only a few minor changes. Instead of a boxed gingerbread or spice cake, I found a recipe for a spicy gingerbread cake from scratch. I added a little more than 2 teaspoons vanilla or bourbon to the whipped cream. Instead, I used about 3 or so of Jim Beam Vanilla bourbon. Instead of regular eggnog, I used Vanilla Spice eggnog by Southern Comfort and added some splashes of the Jim Beam Vanilla bourbon to the eggnog pudding mixture. Finally, I left off the cranberries but crushed ginger snaps on top and placed whole ones around the rim of the bowl.

Yes, this will win the prize at the holiday get togethers! Trader Joe's has a great gingerbread mix.  And the adorable small gingerbread men to go all along the top. Looks like they're holding hands!

This was pretty good.  I did use creamy Cool Whip instead of home made and also doubled the recipe so I'd have a full trifle bowl.  (I gave it 5 stars because I changed the recipe and don't believe in giving anything less than 5 stars if I don't follow the recipe exactly.)  I was able to find the gingerbread mix (look for it near the brownie mixes instead of the cake mixes) but actually think the spice cake mix suggested by many might taste even better.  (I'm a big fan of spice cake.)  It definitely makes an impressive dessert as a trifle should!

Excellent! Made it for Christmas Eve and the only change I made, as some reviewers suggested, was using 2 cups of eggnog and one cup of milk. Crushed some gingersnaps on top and decorated with mini marshmallow gingerbread men I found. It was a nice change from eating cookies and cake. Everyone enjoyed this!

MMMMmmm was this good. We tried not to think of all the calories we were intaking. I used the Coquito recipe instead of the eggnog- just because I had those ingredients on hand and it turned out delicious.

To be honest I was leary about trying this recipe. I chose it because I wanted to make some mini trifle cups for  a Christmas party and it fit the occasion perfectly. I'm glad I gave it a try. The egg nog was no where near as overpowering or sickeningly sweet as I thought it would be. I actually liked it and the cups turned out cute. I followed the recipe other than having to use a boxed spice cake (the store was out of gingerbread cake mixes) and lightly sprinkling crushed graham cracker ontop as a garnish (I didn't have gingerbread cookies to crush). This one is a keeper.

Delicious and so easy! As Per other reviews, I used light eggnog with the vanilla pudding and it was perfect. Also used spice cake as I couldn’t find gingerbread cake. Topped with ginger snaps and it was excellent!

Made this for a Christmas party and took what was left to work to share the next day, and people raved over it!!  I decreased the sugar in the whipped cream to about 2 tablespoons, and it was still plenty sweet with the pudding mix and egg nog. Was hard to find gingerbread cake mix, and the Betty Crocker brand I did find was too mild—-wish I had thought to add extra spices.

It was delicious!  I followed the tips from other reviewers by doubling the eggnog/jello. I ran out of eggnog and had to use 1 cup of milk.   Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the whipped cream.   Everyone loved it and I definitely don’t think the eggnog overpowered it but I love eggnog.  Only thing I would change are the cranberries. I didn’t like the texture of dried cranberries with it.

My family loved this recipe.  We will be adding it to our Christmas menu.  I did use the recommendations of using a 5 oz and 3 oz vanilla pudding with 3 cups of eggnog and 2 cups of milk.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to both the pudding and the whipped cream.  It was simple to make.  It made a beautiful presentation and was delicious!

I made this for thanksgiving  last year.   It was a big hit.  I will be making it again.   I made my own gingerbread.  If you like gingerbread  and eggnog  this a very good recipe.  Enjoy.  I made the whipped cream cinnamon and vanilla.

Made this again for a bake off at work.   I made my own gingerbread and added strawberries to the trifle.  I won 1st place!   
Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for a work party and I got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. In fact, one gal told me it was her favorite dessert at the party. I made the cake from the traditional gingerbread recipe also from alrecipes and followed the instructions here for the rest. I used Pepperidge farm  cookies to decorate the top. It was just beautiful and perfect for a Christmas party!

Amazing! I bought a white cake mix, added about a half cup of molasses, cinnamon, and ginger. I also added Jack daniels to the whipping  cream.  Sprinkle some cinnamon on the top for presentation. This was a major party hit!

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews! Only changes I made were that I used spice cake instead of gingerbread, and I used 2 cups of eggnog and a cup of sweetened condensed milk for the pudding. This was perfect, because it was just a hint eggnog flavor. If you really like the pudding, you're going to want to double it, however I thought the amount was perfect as is. It's also great because you can make it the night before and it tastes better the next day. Definitely making this again for Christmas. Thanks!

Definitely a dish for eggnog lovers! The first time I tried this I doubled the pudding mixture, but it didn't set properly. The next time I used four cups of eggnog with two boxes of pudding mix, and it was a touch too thick...next time I'll try adding a little milk to see how that works. I found Betty Crocker gingerbread cake mix near the brownie mixes. Instead of cranberries I used cake crumbs for garnish, and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the whipped cream.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! So decadent, this will be a "keeper" for holidays to come.  Second time I made it I added a can of eagle brand to the pudding mix along with eggnog....made it over the top rich, yum.  Either way it is "yummola"

Delicious. This was a hit at the Show Choir Bake Sale at the Winter Concert! We scooped out portions into plastic cups and gave them spoons. A step above the cookies and brownies!

Easy to make and pretty to look at.  I made it in individual clear cups as I did not have a trifle dish.

I made this for Christmas.  It was easy and tasted great. A great way to settle down after dinner with a hot cup of coffee.  I wasn't able to find a gingerbread cake mix so I used a spice cake mix.  It worked just fine!

Was a little disappointed in this dish.  The cake dried out quickly, and there was too much of it in proportion to the pudding and whipped cream.  I  might try it again, but with a pound cake instead to add some moisture.

This was quite good.  I used less eggnog--added milk to get the 3 cups.

Absolutely perfect. I used lowfat eggnog that gave a hearty flavor while allowing the dish to remain light and pleasant.

Great recipe! I served these up individually in 8 oz clear plastic cups with one whole ginger snap on top for a garnish. Everyone at my party raved about the taste and presentation! I also put a little bit of cinnamon in the whipped cream, but also a great recipe as is!

I'm rating it a 5 because my extended family keeps asking me to make it again.  They loved it at Christmas.  I do not like really rich desserts so I would prefer a fruit trifle, but this one will definitely impress your company at Christmas time.  If you like gingerbread and eggnog you will no doubt love this dessert.

Maybe because I am not a huge eggnog fan but I didnt really like this at all. I followed the recipe exactly and didnt add the cranberries on top.

Fantastic! Made this during the holidays and everyone loved it. My sister, who claims to not like gingerbread, tried it and had seconds! A new holiday favorite!
