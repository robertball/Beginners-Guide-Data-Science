Hard to rate since I used my own homemade soup and used fresh cooked beans. I don't like using processed food. Made this way it was very good and no surprised ingredients from the canned foods.

This was very good. I couldn't find beefy mushroom soup so I used a can of Cream of Mushroom and added a couple teaspoons of Beef bullion. Great quick and easy meal. My 2 year old loved it.

It was good...I omitted the water and used canned tomato with jalapeno pepper but didn't drain them.

Forgot the cheese and only had brown instant rice and it was still good.

Tasty weeknight meal. I made as directed. Some may like a little more spice, but it was great for us
