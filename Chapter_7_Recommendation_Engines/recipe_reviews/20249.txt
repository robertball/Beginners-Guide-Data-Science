As a professional chef I am always wanting to try new recipes and found this one intriguing with the different spices and extracts.  I found this pie to be too sweet with too many overpowering flavors.  My co-workers and I were unable to taste the natural flavor of the strawberries.  I would reccomend omitting some of the sugar and the extracts.

This pie is so easy!  I did not use any extracts, as I did not have any on hand, and I did not use nutmeg or cinnamon.  This pie still turned out great.  A little sweet, but we used freshly picked strawberries.  I am sure if I had used the sour grocery store type, I would have had to use just as much sugar.  Also, I did not use a lattice crust, I simply put a frozen pie shell on top and it was awesome!

Skip the extracts, use orange extract, omit the nutmeg but keep the cinnamon.

I tried this pie thinking that the vanilla, almond extract, and spices would really complement the strawberries, but in fact I think they taste better on their own.  The filling has a very nice consistency for a lattice top, but I would add more sugar to enhance the flavor.

The taste was excellent, but the pie was very soupy and we had to serve it in a bowl.

This was not very pleasing to me. I found the spices were so overwhelming you can't taste the strawberries.  I would not try this again, but it was not the worst I have had.

This was the first pie I have ever made and for that being said, it was pretty darn good!  The only thing I didn't like was the cinnamon flavor in it.  It almost seemed to distract from the strawberry flavor too much.  I will omit cinnamon next time I make it or at least decrease the amount I use.

this was great, it made me a little nervous being the first to rate when i'm taking it to a party, and typical of cooked strawberry pie, there was a ton of juice, i added tapioca and also used a pate sucree crust,    really good flavor.. i'll make it again.

I think overall this recipe works.  The flavor was good, but I didn't love it and I don't think it is the recipes fault.  I guess I am just not a strawberry pie fan.

I thought this pie was great!  I didn't use almond extract and halved the vanilla.  However, it turned out very yummy!  I thought the strawberry flavors came out great!

Fabulous pie.  I needed to add more strawberries through!  Still turned out well and had lots of compliments!  I can't wait to make another one!  I used Butter Flaky Pie Crust and it went very well together.  Thank you Elyssa and Tara!!

I followed everything perfectly and this pie came out perfect!  Warm it up and add some cool whip and enjoy.  It really is spectacular and i didn't find it over powering or too sweet at all.

This was my first pie, and it was so easy! I used trader joe's pie crust. I altered the recipe a bit- I mashed up half of the strawberries with the flour, sugars, vanilla, and almond extract (omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg.. it didn't seem to go.)  then I sliced up the other half of the strawberrys and arranged them on top. I latticed the top crust, which was also my first time and it was easy. I then did a light milk wash and sprinkled raw sugar all over. I made a heart with some extra crust and cut out my friend's initial (it's her birthday pie). I made 2 little mini pies with the left overs and it was absolutely amazing. the almond extract really made it unique! Can't wait to make more pies :)

I agree with some comments that the flavors are a bit overwhelming. I did end up reducing the vanilla and almond extract to 1/2 TSP each and used just a tinge less white & brown sugar (since My strawberries were pretty sweet). I also cooked it my two pies at 350* for 35 minutes and it ended up perfect. 450* for 45 minutes was too much for my first attempt and the edges got a bit toasty. All and all I love this pie! Even won a contest with it, so I'll definitely be making this (with revisions) again!

We had a bumper crop of Oregon strawberries from our backyard garden this year and couldn't eat them fast enough, so I needed a strawberry pie recipe fast! I chose this one, following the recipe exactly using a prepared pie crust and freshly-ground nutmeg with the fresh strawberries. The pie turned out photo-perfect and tasted simply scrumptious, sweet and delicious with a perfect crust! It truly is the Most Spectacular Strawberry Pie!

This is the first strawberry pie I have made.  I did not add the nutmeg or the almond extract.  Instead, I added extra cinnamon and vanilla extract in place of the ingredients I left out.  It turned out great!!  :)

It was really good, but very sweet.  I would add half the amount of sugar next time.

second time I made this....this time I made a few changes. I think the nutmeg and cinnamon overpower the taste of the strawberries. I decreased the amount of both....but not sure I will make this again.

Lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup and cut the strawberries into large pieces, only had to add an extra table spoon of corn starch - it is the perfect pie. Everyone who had a piece loved it.  I believe having very ripe and good strawberries was the key.

this I awesome!!!I really liked this pie although next time I will omit the almond extract because it was overpowering but it is fast and easy to make and that makes it even better because as a 14yo I have a slight lack of patience
