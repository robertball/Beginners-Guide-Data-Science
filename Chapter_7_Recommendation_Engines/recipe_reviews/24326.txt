This was so yummy!  I made it for Thanksgiving.  I actually cooked the casserole in my crock pot instead of the oven, to save oven space, and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this one again!

These were excellent.  Based on other reviews, I made some adjustments:  used only 1/4 cup water and let the mixture boil for 10 minutes.  Next time, I'm not going to add any water at all.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon.  Excellent.  Thank you.

Fabulous!!!! This is almost exactly my mom's recipe for Thanksgiving sweet potatoes (or Christmas, Easter, etc.) First rate taste, the simple recipes are the best.  I just dotted with a bit more butter & sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on before baking, it adds some caramelizing (is that a word?)to the tops of some of the potatoes.

Since my oven is always full on the holidays, I make this in an electric skillet pan on the counter top (worth the $19.99 just to make this dish). Vent the lid. Delete the water, since it will create condensation that will thin the brown sugar sauce. I always try to lift the lid so that minimum condensation drops into the pan. My grandmother used to cook them this way with the lid off to make the sauce thicker, but it will take longer to cook this way.Delicious!

We always make this kind of candy potato but never had a recipe to follow so it candy sauce comes out different.  Now we make it this way and they are always excellent.  I only use a 1/4 cup of water though. Thanks

These were delicious despite the fact that they were extremely runny, they never carmalized.... I even tried broiling for a few minutes.  I took this dish to a family gathering and people raved over the flavor, but like I said, extremely runny.

I love this recipe.  Even those who say they don't like sweet potatoes like this recipe.  I absolutely hate those marshmallow sweet potato dishes, so this is just simple and wonderful.  I am considering not boiling the potatoes this year and just adding them to the baking pan raw with the sauce.  Has anyone tried this method?  I hope it works out.

These are embarrasingly easy to make and really tasty- sinfully so.  They turned out soft, sweet, and delicious.  A fabulous, classic holiday recipe.  It was my first time cooking sweet potatoes, and they were a hit.

I have always made these potatoes without a recipe to follow, so the taste was different every time.  I tweaked the recipe a bit.   After boiling the potatoes & cutting into 1" rounds, I fried them on each side until browned.  I also changed the sauce a bit, based on other reviews.  I cut the water to 1/8 cup & added 1/8 cup of clear Karo.  I brought the mixture to a boil for about 5-10 minutes, making sure the sugar was dissolved.  Then I poured the sauce mixture over the potatoes lined in a 9" x 13" pan.  I baked in the oven at 350 until the sauce was bubbly.   I made this for a potluck at work & many loved it.  Thank you for a simple recipe that I can now follow.

This is a wonderful simple recipe. I have been making it for 40 years.  I have tried different variations w/marshmallows, pecans etc & my family won't have it.  They want the plain & simple way.  They love it The only differance is that I do not bake it in the oven I put the water, butter & brown sugar in a skillet and bring it to a bubbly stage and put the cut up sweet potatoes in it & keep turning them.  It's great

Ok, I made this recipe and changed the directions a little bit.  I peeled and cubed sweet potatoes in large chunks.  I than boiled them for about 20 minutes than drained and put them in a baking dish.  Finally I replaced the water with canned evaporated milk.  Needless to say, they were AWESOME!

I am like the previous reviewer; I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes made with marshmallows and such.  We had our Thanksgiving celebration just this past weekend and this recipe was a huge hit, a "classic" for sure.  I baked the yams first...be sure to put a lining on bottom oven shelf, the natural sugars seep out and can make quite a smoky mess...once baked and cooled, the skins literally slipped off...sliced the yams and proceeded with the recipe as written.  These are delicious and everyone loved them.  Thank you, Michelle, for sharing this recipe.

Very good - I didn't cook the brown sugar and butter in a pan, though - I just sprinkled it on top of the sweet potatoes and baked them.

Thanks for providing the perfect measurements in recreating this CLASSIC candied sweet potato recipe!  Now I'm able to consistently bring the same dish that my grandmother brought to the table every year... and even better! My son's and daughter in laws are embracing this dish as the traditional standard.

Great recipe!  I changed it a bit.  I used canned sweet potatoes and cooked them in a frying pan.  I also added a little cream instead of water which made the sauce thicker.

As others have noted I too never seem to get the proportions of sugar and butter the same every year. As to pre cooking my mother and aunts always boiled, peeled, than browned in butter before candying the sweet potatoes. Now I just peel raw, slice and brown, then candy. You can do everything but bake theme the day before  and the hold their shape nicely. We do not do marshmallows.

Absolutely classic candied sweet potatoes. Not overly sweet and a beautiful golden brown color when finished cooking. The only thing to mention is that I prefer a somewhat solid but well cooked potato so I under cook them before baking them.

I've been looking for a basic recipe for candied yams for sometime. My search is now over! I boiled the potatoes until they were slightly tender. After they cooled, I peeled & cut them in to cubes. I then added all of the other ingredents, plus some vanilla, to a small pan until well blended; however, I cut the butter & sugar almost in half. Next, I placed the cubed potatoes and the sauce in a crockpot with a little cinnamon & nutmeg. When the potatoes were soft (not mushy) I added a handful of marshmellows. After about 10 minutes, I transferred the candied yams to a baking dish, topped the yams with more marshmellows, and broiled until the marshmellows were brown (this is why I cut back on the sugar b/c of the added marshmellows). I served the Candied Yams for Christmas dinner and my entire family LOVED them. My mom even said they were as good as hers when she used to make them for holiday dinners - now that's a compliment.

OK, I added NO WATER initially after reading reviews.  Just the salt, butter and brown sugar.  Figured I could add water as I went if I needed to.  Once my potatoes were steamed and peeled, I sliced into rounds, put them into my big frying pan, added my syrupy sauce and 'sauteed?' them in the sauce.  Once your heat is high enough the sauce most definitely thickens and then carmelizes.  I never did add any water at all.  My only problem now is that these potatoes taste way better than the Costco pumpkin pie I got for dessert.  I AM NOT KIDDING!!!!!!!  Enjoy! mk

Used yams. Peeled, cut to 1.5" thick rounds, boiled rather than steamed. Omitted water entirely. Huge hit, even with the kids. We topped half with marshmallows; both halves were equally wonderful. Definitely adding this to my EVERY HOLIDAY menu.

This was the first time I tried to make "home-made" candied yams. When I tell you these were "AWESOME", please believe me. I only used 1/4 cup of water per other reviews, but I left everything else the same.  The sauce was thick and delicious and the potatoes were soft with the outide a little crispy. My husband ate half the pan! Best yams I've had! Thanks for sharing.

This is the easiest recipe and the potatoes taste great!  All the ingredients are already in the pantry. Because they are still in chunks, the sweetness is not overpowering (I cut them into 2" chunks instead of 1/2" slices)

The only problem I had with this is, as another review stated, they were quite runny. When the leftovers were heated on the stove they carmalized. The next time I make them I will do them on the stove, not in the oven. Everyone that ate them loved the flavor.

These were really good and easy!  I precooked the sweet potatoes by baking them in the oven instead of steaming.  I cut the amount of water in the butter mixture in half, but other than that - this recipe was wonderfully easy and delicious.

Very delicious!  I didn't have a steamer so I peeled and boiled my yams to slightly tender then cooked as directed.  I used only 1/4C of water per other recommendations added nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla and was very pleased with the result, as was my family!

I personally learned this recipe from my mother in-law, only I used Princilla canned yams, put them into a large baking dish, sprinkled with brown sugar & dotted with buttrer.  Baked at 350 until syrup,was bubbly & browned. This is a great dish for all occasions.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  Everyone loved them!  I did change just a few things, I made these steaming them first and I have also made these without par cooking first (which I will do from now on), both were fabulous.  A also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to them just to give them that classic "Holiday" flavor.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  My mother-in-law said they were even better than hers!

These were good. They needed more than half an hour to get soft by steamin, but when I baked them they became like a cassorole, which was fine. Cut the water to 1/4 of a cup.

Easy and tasty but nothing unique.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and, of course, marshmallows.  This recipe works well when you are pressed on time.

Very simple and easy recipe, which came out great. During the last 5 minutes of baking, I removed the lid and sprinkled mini marshmallows on top and let them brown. The next time I make this, I might cut down on the sugar a bit also.

My husband is a huge fan of candied yams...but, I am not. However, I enjoyed this recipe. And, he loved it! I only made a few minor changes. I cubed and boiled my potatoes. I omitted the salt, since I used salted butter and added 1/4 cup of orange juice to the sugar mixture. Also, I added cinnamon to the sugar mixture. You can't have sweet potatoes without cinnamon! Because I boiled them, the potatoes only took about 30 minutes in the oven to finish. Will definitely make this one again, and again, and again...

The first time I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving (but used 1 sliced potato instead of 3/4) & doubled the sauce.  For some reason after baking for ~ an hour (per the directions) the sauce was completely gone.  It was good, though a little chewy where it caramelized - but I wanted the gooey sauce like my mother-in-law's. So, the following day I did them in a slow cooker (1 hour on high then turn to keep warm) to avoid losing the sauce & they were a million times better.  I also made the following changes the second time - cut into large chunks instead of slices, used DARK brown sugar, added a sprinkle of cinnamon & ~ 1/2 tsp of maple flavoring, and doubled the sauce (though I think maybe 1 1/2 of the sauce recipe would have been better?).  ALSO - if using a slow cooker, when steaming the potatoes don't steam them all the way or you'll have mush (which is what I ended up with for the bottom half of my crockpot).  I steamed them for 30 min & they were still pretty hard in the middle so I steamed them for another 30 min. since the directions said "until tender".  I should have stopped after the first 30, as they would have continued to cook in the crockpot & may have held their shape better.
UPDATE: made in oven with 2 large cans of sweet potatoes - definitely did not need to make so much sauce (I made 1 1/2 recipe), but not sure I cooked for as long (just keep an eye on it). Tasted just fine with canned, so was a great way to make this recipe super easy & quick.

Delicious! Substituted sliced canned sweet potatoes (drained), and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  After baking potatoes for about 1/2 hour I topped with marshmallows and returned to oven to brown. Yummy!!

These were delicious.  Made this for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and my family liked it.  I made a few changes and substituted about 1/4 cup orange juice for the water.  Next time I might add a bit more orange juice to it.  I also added cinnamon to it and it was delightful.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

For years I alway's bought the Mrs. Paul's Candied Sweet Potatoes until last year they were no where to be found.  So I went online, found this recipe and made it...it was so delicious! I will never look for already made Candied Sweet Potatoes, I will always make this recipe.  I'm making it again this year for Thanksgiving.

Excellent-made them yesterday 11/26/09 for Thanksgiving.  I'll never buy Mrs Paul's again!Just a few suggestions:cut back on the butter from a 1/2 cup to a 1/4 cup, cut down on the water from 1/4 cup to 4 tablespoons and if you don't want mushy sweet potatoes, steam for 15 mins instead. They'll be nice and tender after baking in the candy sauce for 45-60 mins.

I love the classic taste and simplicity of this recipe.  However, I find that steaming the potatoes before baking results in potatoes that are way too mushy.  I have made this two times and cut down the steam time, but haven't found a way to get the potatoes to the consistency that I like.  This recipe is a keeper - worth trying again and again.

I agree with several others that you shouldn't use all the water that this recipe calls for.  I probably added 1/4 to 1/3 cup which was just about right.  Other than that, the proportions are right on!  Other personal observations/changes are as follows: I added just a bit (about 1/8 tsp.) of maple extract and about five minutes before removing from the oven I topped each sweet potato slice with a canned mandarin orange segment and a bright red, fresh cranberry.  I think the flavor of this dish improves the next day, so I'll probably make it the day ahead from now on and then warm up when needed.  Now that's a time saver when you're trying to prepare a big holiday feast.

If I made these again, I would cut way back on the butter, sugar and water.  They were too greasy and too sweet.  I even used more sweet potatoes than called for, but they went largely uneaten at a feast where everything else was demolished.

Pretty good.  I don't like candied sweet potatoes, but I made these for traditions sake for those who like them.  My husband took them out of the oven for me, and was sure he wouldn't like them.  In the end, we both liked them, and I'll use this recipe again for Christmas.  I might add a few marshmallows on top because it would look nicer that way.

I made these with fresh sweet potatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They tasted good, but needed something to give them some holiday oomph.  If I make these again I will add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg. Maybe even a spot of cream.  If you're in a hurry, canned sweet potatoes would work fine for this simple recipe.  Thanks for sharing it with the community!

Always good and just the right proportions.  Very simple. I use pineapple juice instead of the water.

I love yams and these were very good.  Next time I will steam my potatoes for a little less time because once they are in the oven with the glaze they continue to cook.  As a result I felt they were a bit too soft.  Still tasty though!

Simple and absolutely delicious.  I'm so happy to find the recipe that used fresh yams instead on canned.  It turned out amazing.  I cut the yams in small chunks and boiled them in a little water.  I put ten marshmallows on top when it was almost done to melt in. I also did NOT use the water.  Turned out perfect.  Thank you!

Very good, but make sure to use the yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes. I used the whiteish ones, and while they tasted good, they looked unappetizing.

These are my favorite!  Very similar to how I remember my mom making them.  She just put the sauce ingredients over the potatoes prior to baking instead of combining and boiling prior to putting on potatoes.  Though she also used maple syrup instead of water.  This way was just as good!

Loved the recipe however I added my own twist.  After Step 4 , I sprinkled ground cinnamon, ground cumin and ground nutmeg over the top for added flavor.  It was delicious.  Simple yet easy and very yummy indeed!  Thank you!

This recipe received rave reviews this past Easter. I followed others' suggestions on here and added only 1/4 c of water. Next time I may add none so that the potatoes "candy-up" more.

Very simple and comes out great every time. I ended up having to leave it sit longer than I expected and ut was even better. I think next time I'll plan on letting it sit/simmer for at least 2 hours so the sauce can really work its way into the potatoes.

It's my new old standby.  This is simple and consistent.  I used to use my grandmas recipe which was similar, but this is much easier as hers was a stovetop method which involved turning the potato slices often.  My son likes these with mini marshmallows sprinkled on top at the end and browned under the broiler.

No complaints on this recipe.  I feel if I cooked the sauce a little longer to gain some thickness to it, it would have coated the yams better.  I did top off the dish with mini marshmellows baked briefly under a broiler for added touch.  It really came out good.

Made these for Thanksgiving.  Perfect, just the recipe I was looking for.  Prepared with exact ingredients, but cooked in a slow cooker for 4 hrs the transferred to a 13X9 and broiled with mini marshmallows for about 3-5 minutes.  Excellent!!!

This recipe is the best!  I made it for a gathering and it went fast.  The only changes I made was  substituted a cup of orange juice for the water in the saucepan.

This was so simple and easy. Basted maybe twice the whole hour it baked. I skinned and boiled the potatoes. Got distracted by a phone call and over boiled them. Wish I had undercooked them a tad because final product was really soft and mushy. I used 1/4 cup water like other people suggested and glad I did because there is plenty of liquid! I boiled the glaze for 5 min. Will probably do 10 min next time I try this and see if they come out less runny. I added cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Overall very delicious and super easy to make!!

I made this exactly as written but rather than add the water I used spiced apple juice and that made this fantastic. It's easy and it is one of those things you can bake when you are waiting for your turkey to rest, I always rest my turkey for an hour for every hour it baked and this dish fits right in with that.

I searched for my mom's recipe and found it right here!  HOWEVER...I used only 3 sweet potatoes (large ones) and used the same amount of the other ingredients and the potatoes soaked up the syrup and they were perfect.

This is super easy and always a favorite.  I boil the sweet potatoes for 10 min whole and that makes the skin slide right off.  Then I slice potatoes in half, place in 9x13 and cover with sugar/butter mixture.  Great recipe; thanks for sharing

I had very large potatoes so they needed an additional 30 minutes to steam.  I added some cinnamon and orange sliced thin to the potatoes.  These were very good and easy to make.  I I was in a hurry, but next time I will try some of the other suggestions.

Only change I made was adding a little cinnamon to the brown sugar.  It was for a potluck at our clubhouse and I was told they were the best sweet potatoes on the table of all of them!  I had made a double batch and three people asked if they could take a few bites home with them!

This is exactly my Grandmother's recipe too! It's just a simple, delicious, old school candied sweet potato recipe. ... just perfect.  (**for the reviewers that feel the syrup is a bit thin, just add some more brown sugar) 
I was stressed because I wasn't quite sure about the amount of water. and didn't  want to mess it up. I never wrote it down and just did it from memory...until I forgot! :D
Both my parents are gone  now so there's no one left to ask. Thank you so much! I'll be making these again for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

I've been making this recipe since 2004 (that's the date on my printed recipe). I follow the recipe and measurements exactly, except maybe more sweet potatoes, since sweet potatoes vary so much in size.  My family loves it!!!

Super simple, adjustable. I varied the number of sweet potatoes to fit my need and then I baked them to just fork tender, cooled them, cut them into chunks, added the syrup as per recipe, added mallows and stuck in the oven. When it was good and hot and pots were done as I desired, I turned the broiler on to crisp up the mallows and it was done in less than an hour with very little work! Loved it, thanks!!!

This is soooo close to my mother's and grandmother's recipe!  Instead of water, use 1/4 c of orange juice and a tsp of vanilla.  If you make them in a skillet, cook low and slow without the lid for up to an hour and a half.  You want the sauce to carmelize and heat (not steam) the sweet potatoes.  I also prefer ice cube size chunks instead of slices, so they don't fall apart.  Feel free to add a dash or so of cinnamon if you want the flavor.  I also loved another person's crockpot idea....especially for holidays when every cooktop and oven is occupied!

I always make the candied sweets this way but instead of water I use orange juice which gives the potatoes added flavor.

Thank you for the recipe. My mother-in-law made the best candied sweet potatoes I ever tasted and didn't measure anything, I guess. I asked her for the recipe and she just said a little butter and brown sugar. How disappointing!  These are perfect.  They taste just like hers.  Finally got it. :)  Thanks again... By the way, I made it exactly as written, except I only use a tablespoon of water.

My father-in-law wanted sweet potatoes without coconut, marshmallows, or pecans which cut out all my standard recipes! I had a bag of Schwan's frozen sweet potatoes on hand that I used, they already had a touch of sea salt so I did not add any more. I used orange juice instead of water. I poured the hot butter, sugar and juice mixture over the potatoes and put them in the fridge overnight. I baked them the next day and they are delicious!! This is a classic recipe that let's the taste of the sweet potato come through, definitely a keeper!

I added a tsp of lemon juice in the mix to balance out the sweetness a bit. Also 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of Nutmeg. So good. Just like my moms.

It was an okay recipe, but there are easier ways to make these. You can fry sweet potatoes in oil and add corn starch sauce (or any clear sweetner)!
