All my favorite ingredients in one dish.  Rather than just olive oil I think this could benefit from a little garlic and white balsamic vinegar.  A perfect summer treat!

Made this recipe for my son and his girlfriend.  She is allergic to diary so left the mozzarella out. Was still well received. Added the fresh mozzarella to the leftovers and it was still a hit. Will make again and again!  Did use a balsamic reduction instead of just the vinegar.

Love this recipe! I grow my own  tomatoes and basil, so this is now my "go to" salad! I added balsamic vinegar and used truffle salt instead of regular salt.
