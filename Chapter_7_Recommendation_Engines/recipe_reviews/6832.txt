This is a fantastic recipe!  I added a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 1/2 Tablespoons orange juice.  Delicious!

Can be adapted for the bread machine by cutting all ingredient measures in half, reducing butter to 5, and reducing yeast to a little over one tablespoon.  Dough is very sticky and needs additional flour when turned out after dough cycle.  Worth every amount of work.  Very tasty!

These are very good. I did change the process the ingredients stayed pretty much the same. I did have to add 4 cups of flour for the dough to come together which is a lot! And I also doubled the zest called for. After mixing the flour with the yeast mixture I kneaded the dough for 8 minutes until it was smooth. Then I let the dough rise outside of the fridge covered with a towel for 1 1/2 hours. Deflate the dough, separate into 2 equal portions, roll out spread butter mixture on the dough, roll up and cut. Then I placed them in the fridge for the night covered with plastic wrap, in the morning I took the rolls out and set them on the counter for about 30 minutes while the oven preheated. Then baked. I did this because I did not want to get up so early to roll out the dough and let it rest. It worked perfectly the way I did it. I did not get 30 rolls because I cut them much thicker than called for. I got 22 large rolls. For a frosting I creamed together an 8oz cream cheese and 1/2 c butter (both softened) added 1 teaspoon orange extract, 3 tablespoons Orange Juice and 2 c powdered sugar. Then thinned it down with additional oj. The icing was really good on these! Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out great!  A nice change from the usual cinnamon rolls.  I also made icing and drizzled over top.  I made the dough in the bread machine - I have a small machine and so cut the recipe in thirds, but still needed 6 tbsp butter and 1/2 cup sugar to fully cover the rolled out dough.  Will definitely make again.

An extremely soft dough making it hard to handle, but worth it as the rolls are delicious.  I drizzled a little powdered sugar and orange glaze over them, took them to a family Easter brunch and they were gone in fifteen minutes.

These rolls are so delicious. The delicate orange flavor makes a nice counterpoint to the richness of the buttery dough. Almost like eating cotton candy, they are so tender! I iced them with the Orange Cream Cheese Frosting, from this website, and they are irresistible. I will also use this recipe for cinnamon rolls and dinner rolls. Outstanding!

Yum!  I made these when I made Cinn rolls.  Just about the same prep work.  Very tasty.  I hadn't been able to get the right filling for orange rools before.

I tried several methods and the original recipe is the best method.  I ended up baking them in round cakes pans instead of muffin pans and found them to be much better that way.  I wanted to be able to serve them at a party for 36 women hot out of the oven so the method I finally came up with was to bake them off and then freeze them.  I reheated them for about 25 minutes at 325 and then iced them with a basic powered sugar icing,(powdered sugar, vanilla & milk).  It was alot of work to make that many rolls but it was so worth the effort.  The look on the faces when they took that first bite was like they had just arrived in heaven!!  I am still hearing from the women about them.  Freezing them is a wonderful way to be able to have them often and they were just as if they had just come fresh out of the oven.  Make them for your family and freinds and just watch the reaction!!! A cooks dream!!! Note:  I always have to add quite a bit of flour.

I thought I couldn't bake.  This recipe is so good and even I can do it, (that says a lot)!  I top these rolls with orange frosting and even at four dozen, they never last more than one day!!!

I am new to making sweet rolls but these turned out fantastic!  The first time I made this recipe, I made them according to the recipe except for that in the morning after I got them out of the fridge, I didn't wait 2 hours for it to come to room temperature.  They warmed up quickly on their own from the warmth of my hands as I patted out the dough.  They were very moist and tender, just the perfect texture. The second time I made them,  the only thing I did different was that I did not let them rise in the fridge for 8 hours.  I didn't have time because company was coming over, so I let it rise in a warm spot for an hour, then shaped the rolls and let them rise again for thirty minutes.  They turned out amazing!  I will use this recipe from now on...no need to look any further for a sweet roll recipe.  FYI: you can use this recipe to make wonderful cinnamon rolls, lemon rolls, whatever flavor you are in the mood for!  You can also make a simple glaze with powdered sugar, flavoring, water and a little butter or margarine.

I scaled these down to a half an order.  They were very good.  BUT I did make two modifications.  Instead of using all water, I left out four tablespoons and added four tablespoons of orange extract to the dough for flavor.  I also added fresh sqeezed orange to the filling in the center and a light orange glaze for the rolls.  VERY good, and with these modifications there was just enough orange flavor to these rolls!

These were VERY good! I didn't end up putting the icing on because everyone loved them right out of the pan! Next time though I will make the rolls thicker because it's what the family is used to as my grandmother's caramel rolls were always 3-4 in high.

I scaled this to 24 servings. I think most yeast dough recipes don't get the flour proportions correct when you scale them smaller, and I had to add a good bit more flour to get a dough that held together (but was still very soft). I thought it might be hard to work with, but the butter keeps it from sticking to everything. After rising, I rolled it out, spread the filling on it and formed a log and sliced with dental floss. I ended up with 12 rolls. I let the formed rolls rise in the refrigerator overnight, in the morning took them out 30 minutes before baking and baked them. I used a cream cheese icing. Delicious!

These were a hit at our Mother's Day brunch. Very light and fluffy with a wonderful orange flavor. I did find the dough to be sticky and added about another 1/2 cup of flour, but by the next morning I had no trouble rolling it out. I made the filling the night before and also a batch of the orange cream cheese frosting from this website and let those meld in the refrigerator overnight. I microwaved the filling briefly to soften it up to a spreadable consistency. The frosting was spreadable by the time the rolls had finished baking. This is definitely a keeper recipe. I can't wait to make them again!

This recipe is awesome!  I take care of a woman who has Alzheimer's and she described something along this line.  It was a hit with her!  When I asked her if it tasted like her Mother's recipe, with tears in her eyes she said yes!

I did not have the time to raise overnight.  I raised like bread only to more than double.  And followed the rest as written.  Be forewarned...the 2nd rising is very quick--less than 30 min!  Make sure to cut smaller than you think!   They were huge, and delicious!

I did make a glaze for over the top.  "It had an orange sauce over the top."  I used the leftover 2 Tb of butter, the juice from the zested oranges, powdered sugar, and about 1/4 tsp almond extract. (They weren't drenched, but had enough flavor work.) 

Will definitely make again!

This needed more flour, DON'T let the dough just be sticky, add more flour.  If you don't add more flour then the dough is extremely difficult to work with because it's too soft.  The orange is a nice change from cinnamon.  I made an orange glaze with orange juice and powdered sugar to go over the top.  I prefered this cold rather than warm.

I made this recipe exactly as stated last Sun, for an Easter brunch, and it was good. I made it again today with the following modifications:
   I used bread flour instead of AP flour, and the result was a tender but sturdier roll; I used Tangelo zest and ground cardamom for the filling, and I used a milk icing with jasmine extract in place of vanilla extract. The result was a more intensely tropical orange flavor. These changes brought this recipe from a 4.5 to a 5, for my taste at least.

I absolutely looooved this recipe (so did my fellow staff members). It was a huge success at early breakfast meetings. The first time I made this, I didn't have quite enough orange zest so I used some lemon zest as well and they were delish.

My bread machine broke and hate working the dough with my hands.  This recipe takes some time but if you don't want to kneed its pretty good.  I did have to add one cup of flour without it the dough would be way too sticky.   Made 24 good size rolls in cupcake pans did one pan orange and the other cinnamon both were good and light, its a preference thing.

Delicious. I love this as a nice, fresh, spring/summery alternative to Cinnamon Rolls. The dough is great to work with too. Extremely soft and fluffy and delicious.

For the amount of work, these rolls were just so-so.  I brought them to work and brought home over half.  I have made better rolls from Bisquick mix.

Holy Heavenly Goodness.  Light as air, delicate little buns of orangey sweet yeasty rolls...what's not to like?  I did not find the dough to be difficult at all, it was cold enough that it rolled beautifully.  Edit* I made these a second time on a very humid day and my dough required a significant amount of extra flour.  As with any yeast bread, the amount of flour can be greatly affected by the amount of humidity in the air.

I also needed to add about another cup of flour.  I think adjusting flour is a given with this type of recipe based on humidity and other factors.  Otherwise I let it rise on my kitchen counter for about an hour, then put it in the refrigerator for about 4 hours where it doubled in size.  This was a great dough to work with- pressed it out into a rectangular shape and then rolled it to specified thickness.  Rolls baked up beautifully after they rose in the pan (2-9x13 pans)for about 30 minutes.  I wrapped and froze one pan as suggested by another reader.  The other pan was frosted with the Orange cream cheese frosting from this site.  Delicious and a keeper for many sweet roll possibilities!

The flavor was good, but these were quite a bit of work so I cannot say I would make them often. Also, cooking in the muffin tins was a neat idea to keep everything separated, but I surprisingly had issues with mine cooking evenly this way.  The ones on the edges were done and the ones in the middle were very not done (and I am one who likes gooey rolls!) Next time I would try putting them in a 13 x 9 pan like I do with the cinnamon rolls I make and see if that works better.  To top off these rolls, I made a glaze of powdered sugar and orange juice.  These were very filling and were enjoyed by my guests all weekend.

I loved these orange rolls, they are delicious.  I didn't totally follow the directions, I made a whole batch and I needed an extra 2c of flour to get it to a workable state, and I kneaded it a little before setting it aside to proof, for a more tender bread the gluten has to be strong.  I just put it aside in a warm place for about an hour, I was going to make them straight away so there was no need to put it in the fridge.  The only other thing I did differently was to mix the juice of an orange with enough icing sugar to make a small amount of glaze for the top.

This one is hard to rate. It turned out fantastic, but there are some real issues with the recipe that I think merit a loss of a star. Mainly, I divided this recipe in half and STILL had to add 1.5 cups of flour to get a workable dough. But once I'd done that, the dough was so beautiful, easy to roll, and buttery tender in flavor that it was worth the extra flour. The extra flour did throw off the yield though, and because I didn't size up the filling I wound up with not enough filling -- so be forewarned, if you add more flour to make this dough come together, add more filling. In the future I would use brown sugar in the filling, twice as much fresh orange zest, and cinnamon. Thanks for sharing your recipe, I iced mine with an OJ/powdered sugar icing.

These rolls are excellent!  I had to add about 1 cup of flour, but I kept everything else the same.  I topped them with cream cheese icing flavored with OJ and some orange zest.  The orange rolls actually were gone before the cinnamon rolls at a church brunch.  Rave reviews by all!

For years I have competed in the county fair and have looked and looked for the right recipe for cinnamon rolls. Every year I thought I had it and to no avail place in the lower placing's. NOT this year with this recipe, Took GRAND-CHAMP of yeast division. I keep the recipe the same no changes but cinnamon instead of orange flavor. THANK YOU Heidi

Delicious!
I used my bread machine and used both bread machine flour and yeast, and went through the dough stage. The dough was very soft and only took a small amount of flour to roll out.
I halved the recipe to fit in my machine. Can't wait to make them again. I might actually use the whole amount of filling the next time just to make them a little more gooey.
Either way this is a winner!!

I used the 24-serving recipe and did add an extra cup of flour. I also used almost twice as much filling. The rolls turned out great - a very light and airy bread with a great orange flavor (I topped with a cream cheese orange frosting - cream cheese, orange juice, powdered sugar). Next time I'll try it without the extra cup of flour; once the dough came out of the fridge (btw I left it in for 16 hours and it was fine) it was a lot easier to work with (not the sticky mess it was at first).

I would have given these 5 stars except I did have to add flour..about 1 1/2 cups, in fact. Otherwise it would have not been a dough. And I didn't do the traditional cinnamon filling but a white chocolate and lemon mixture. I topped them with a lemon juice infused cream cheese frosting and they were to die for. Yummy. I will definately use this recipe (modified)again.

I think the title of these rolls should be Carolyn's Overnight Orange Rolls.  When I first decided to make this recipe, I just read through the ingredients and did not notice that you need to chill the dough overnight.  I was stuck, so I added an additional cup of flour and did not chill the dough b/c I had no time.  They turned out great but very strong yeasty taste.  Is it necessary to put 3 tablespoons of yeast in here?

This one is a keeper. My husband and I loved this recipe.  The rolls were nice and very light. Since it is just the two of us I had to scale it down to 12 instead of 48 and found that I had to add about a cup of extra flour because the dough looked more like batter with only 1 1/2 cups flour.  Light organge icing was great on them.  This will definitely become a Sunday morning treat for many years to come.  Thanks for sharing!

These have a very nice light Orange flavor that I didn't find too sweet at all. The dough is quite hard to work with and while they are wonderful fresh out of the oven we didn't like them very well the next day. If I were to make again I would definitely make less.

I adjusted the recipe to 12 servings and baked the rolls in an oversize muffin tin resulting in 6 rolls.  The baking time was 15 minutes and they came out light and with good texture.  I drizzled the rolls with a mixture of confectioner’s sugar and orange juice while warm which added just a little sweetness that I felt the rolls needed.  They were a nice change from cinnamon rolls with the citrus flavor, but cinnamon rolls will always be my go to sweet roll.

I was a little nervous at first because the dough is sooo soft. it's almost like a thick batter. But when tossed a couple times on a floured surface it rolls out beautifully and was shockingly easy to work with. My family loved them, even my husband who normally doesn't like breakfast rolls. They aren't overly sweet, a glaze made of 1 C powdered sugar and 3 tbsp orange juice went wonderfully with them! A keeper for sure.

I’ve attempted to make this twice and the dough is lumpy and super thin and runny. I attempted to add more flour but ended up throwing it away both times. Maybe user error but will be looking for another recipe. I make cinnamon rolls often blaming the recipe.

I always taste the dough before it rises and this was pretty bland. I even added orange peel, cardamom, cloves, vanilla extract and extra sugar to the dough and it still was short on flavor.

Wow! I've made quite a few cinnamon rolls over the years, but this dough recipe tastes amazing! I halved the recipe and made them right away instead of putting them in the fridge overnight. They turned out so soft and yummy! As recommended by another reviewer, I used an orange cream cheese frosting recipe from all recipes. These were absolutely divine.

A little time consuming but my family LOVED these! I also made it with orange cream cheese frosting that I found on here, and they were awesome!

I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was to add orange zest to the dough too and i didnt wait over night. I did need to add extra flour, maybe 2 cups. it was still very sticky but when it was done rising it was very very easy to work with. The rolls are light and fluffy!! Everyone liked these better than regular cinnamon rolls. I got 27. I used 1 cup of butter for the filling and added a little extra sugar and I had the perfect amount of filling.

Yum!  I craved oranges when I was pregnant years ago.  I was on bedrest, so no cooking.  My mother would come over and really was brilliant at making things with Oranges!  Too bad I didn't have this recipe back then:)

Yummy!  Made these for Easter breakfast and we loved them!  I looked at the reviews before embarking on the recipe to see what others said.  Yes, I also had to add over an extra cup of flour to make the dough workable...still soft but not sticky.  I added orange extract to the dough to enhance the orange flavor.  I also add grand extract to the butter before I rolled them...I melted the butter and spread it over the rolled out door, the sprinkled on the sugar, then added the orange zest.  Like other reviewers, I baked in greased glass pans.  I made the Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing from this site, changing vanilla to orange extract and organce juice for milk.  These rolls are light and airy and not overly sweet as some reviewers state.  They are loaded with butter, but adding orange extract cuts that richness.  Can't give five stars as the flour is the problem.

This recipe made 30 large rolls for me. It was only the second time I had ever made any type of yeast bread outside a bread maker, but they turned out great. I took them to a couple of families and left half with my family and they were all gone in a day. I did make the orange glaze with  orange juice and powdered sugar which really turned them into a dessert. Will start making regularly as they are worth the work.

The amount of flour needed in mine was way more then the recipe calls for.  The dough needs to be coming off the sides of the bowl, still soft and a little sticky, so keep that in mind when adding the flour. I almost doubled the amount of zest in "filling", and added zest to the cream cheese topping I made.  on the day it still didn't taste much like orange, but the next day, its full of flavor.  I missed buttermilk in the dough, and some orange taste, so next time, I will add 2 spoons of orange juice to the milk.  That should do it!

These were very tasty. I think I'd prefer them as a holiday bread option - ala panetone shortcut - than a breakfast roll. Next time I'll try this by skipping the frosting and maybe adding a bit of candied orange peel and/or golden raisins. Thanks!

Wonderful flavour! I found the dough a little soft, and added a bit of extra flour when turning it out. I'll add a bit more to the dough initially the next time. I received many compliments for these rolls.

very light and tasty roll, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good however next time I make these I will use orange marmalade instead of orange zest. Other than that this is a great roll that I will make again and again.

Pretty good.  My husband has been wanting Orange Rolls for a while now so I decided to get them a try for Father's Day.  He liked them, but he likes Orange Rolls sweeter and with frosting.

the rolls were good, but not great.  We'll keep looking.  May have been better if we had a cream cheese icing ontop.

Waaay too sweet for my boyfriend and even for me, which says something. Will definitely make again, but will reduce sugar and maybe try cinnamon instead of orange.  I topped these with "glory icing" (confectioner's sugar, melted butter and milk) which was a great addition.
