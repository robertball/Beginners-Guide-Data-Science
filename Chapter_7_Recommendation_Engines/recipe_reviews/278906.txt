I loved this cake. Very rich in flavor and not to sweet! Next time I am going to make very large muffins with this recipe.

The cake is amazing.  Note, be sure the beer is room temperature or it will make the butter hard.  The whipped cream did not have much taste. I think next time we will add a little flavor.  Also, we did not add walnuts, we decided next time, we will add walnuts.

I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and the butter by 1/2 stick. It still came out beautifully intact and delicious. I didn't have the flat bundt cake mold but improvised with the regular mold only sprayed it well before adding the batter. It didn't stick at all!!
