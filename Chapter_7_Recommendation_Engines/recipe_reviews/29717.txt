I'm sorry but any recipe that calls for beef broth is NOT vegetarian. It doesn't tase very good using vegetable stock.

I added some tofu and spinach when I made this soup, but it was not that good.  The hoisin sauce was too sweet for the taste and texture of the peas, and it was sort of bland.  I gave it an extra star because my fiance (who, granted, cooks with hoisin more often) sorta liked it.  Nix that, he just said it was gross.
