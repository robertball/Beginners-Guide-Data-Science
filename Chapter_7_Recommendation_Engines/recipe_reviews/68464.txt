Sounds like a good receipe but everyone is forgetting the true taste of the Sweden meatball,add nutmeg.
Yes that's right, freshly grated prefered. I usually add 1/2 teaspoon to 1lb of ground beef or more to your likng. You will be amazed at the taste. Also add some to the gravy, start small and experiment as the flavor can over power the dish. You'll never make it again without this ingredient.

This recipe was pretty good.  I think some fresh mushrooms would add a lot to it, if you like them.  It's an even easier recipe if you bake the meatballs in a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes, rather than on the stove.  You can stick them in the oven and do other things while they bake.  Still scrape the sheet they bake on for "pan drippings" though!

This was very good. And really easy and quick to put together. I did leave out the cheddar cheese in the meatball since I didn't have any on hand. I baked the meatballs at 375 for 15 minutes and they were done perfectly. When making the sauce instead of the drippings, since I was baking the meatballs, I used 3 T of melted butter. I replaced one cup of water with a cup of coffee and left out the instant coffee. I did simmer the meatballs in the sauce after they were cooked. The meatballs came out tender and flavorful. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe last week. I liked that out of most of the recipes I looked at it had the lowest fat content. I also liked that it incorporated veggies. My only problem was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I found that I'm not a fan of the texture of ground turkey as compared to ground beef. I used it once before in chilli and I wasn't too impressed there either. I will try the recipe again with ground beef instead.

Good.  I used home made bread crumbs and regular strong coffee.  The sauce was nice and thick and it just a little bit bland.  Not sure I'll put in next time to enhance the flavor.

I made this last night. My husband liked it, but I thought it was just ok. I served it over noodles. I omitted the coffee. I added a lil more sour cream. I also made the meatballs larger than the recipe says. They came out pretty well cooked from my nonstick pan on the stove top. The sauce was alright...it needed more seasoning. I added salt, pepper, and parsley. I also cut up some fresh mushrooms and added them to the meatballs. Next time I think I will omit the green pepper, as I didnt really like the flavor. I didnt think they needed cheedar cheese either. Other than that, I would probably make this again.

This is a really great recipe.  I use the meatballs from Ikea instead of making my own, lazy I know!  The sauce is great and the only thing I changed was omitting the coffee granules - that just sounded like a weird addition to me.  I really like the sour cream in it, gives it a bit of tang, which is nice.  Otherwise very yummy and easy to make.

This was okay.  The flavor was really good, but the meatballs were a little mushy.  I think next time I will bake the meatballs in the oven, then add them to the sauce.

I just used the sauce, but I didn't use the drippings or coffee.  I added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the flour and followed the rest of the recipe adding some leftover frozen meatballs we had and then letting it simmer and thicken.  This is yummy!!!

Was a very good recipe.  I love the Banquet frozen dinner swedish meatballs and have been looking for years for a recipe that tastes close...this one does.  The meatballs are really tender and the sauce is great.  The only problem I had is the amount of sauce.  We like ours with enough to pour over the noodles too & even though I doubled the sauce part of the recipe there was hardly any left after the simmering.  I'm going to try canning the sauce and freezing some meatballs separately then I can heat the balls up in the sauce when I cook it & there might be more left over.  Overall a very good recipe & will definately be making it many times more!  :)

I made the meatballs only.  Delicious! I did not put in the green pepper as the hubby doesn't like them.  I will if he is not eating them.   Great flavor, tender and NOT DRY! I used a can of cream of chicken soup, about 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/2 soup can of milk and fresh pepper mixed for the sauce.  I browned the meatballs and cooked them for about 1 1/2 hours in the sauce.  Served over mashed potatoes=perfect comfort food!! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars with the changes that were made by a couple other reviewers. I added the fresh gratted nutmeg to both the meatballs and the sauce, baked the meatballs at 350° for 30 minutes and then simmered in the sauce on the stovetop for a bit and I used a cup of coffee in place of the instant coffee and one cup of the water. These turned out really good and fairly easy to make. I will definately make these again.

I also cheated and used pre-made meatballs.  The sauce was a little bland so I added a little worcestershire sauce and it turned out perfect! I baked the meatballs, made the sauce and then threw it all together in the crockpot to simmer for a couple of hours.  The kids and the hubby all loved it! I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty meatballs, and I love the flavor the coffee adds to the beef stock.  I omit the green pepper, and use Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  Great served over whole wheat noodles!

I was interested in trying this recipe because it didn’t call for creamed soup.  I loved the meatballs in this and wouldn’t change them, although I did add salt when making them and baked them at 375 for 20 minutes (mine were a little larger than 1 inch).  The gravy, however, really didn’t do much for me.  I didn’t have coffee granules, so maybe that was it.  It was very thin so I thickened it with a little Wondra.  I should have added a splash of white wine or sherry.  I think that would have improved it.  Next time I will try making this with the coffee to see if that adds the pizzazz this needs.  Also, I made the gravy ahead of time but did not add the sour cream.  I added it to the cool gravy and gently reheated.  No chance of the sour cream “breaking” or “curdling” that way.

I gave this 5 stars for the way I made it because  Of Course I didnt have most of the ingredients.  I used frozen meatballs and no coffee.  I melted butter in a pan and added the flour to it and then I didnt have beef boullian so I used a packet of  onion soup mix.  I did the recipe as it sait to otherwise.  It turned out GREAT!!!

This was good.  I didn't use the coffee in the sauce so I added in fresh parsley. I also didn't add the cheese or green pepper to the meatballs just because I didn't have either on hand.  I think I will make this again, a good recipe for ground beef.

These were delicious.  If you are in a hurry bake some and save a few to cook in a skillet so you can get the drippings to make the gravy.

I thought this recipe was ok. Seasoning wasn't mentioned in this recipe so I felt it lacked flavor. After adding seasoning salt, it was better. Also, trying to brown the meatballs was difficult since they stuck to the pan. I won't make this again.

This has become our quick dinner recipe with a few shortcuts but still all the flavor.  1. I use frozen meatballs and put them in the noodle water. This allows them to thaw and give a bit of flavor to the water as well. 2.  I start the sauce recipe with oil in a pan, heated then add the flower and coffee (Basic rue). *This is the only recipe that I have with instant coffee so I use the individual serving packets.* I follow the recipe from here on.

This was my first time making "real" meatballs and my husband called them a success!  I omitted the coffee because I highly dislike coffee.  I also did not have bullion, so I used a can of beef broth in place of the bullion and water.  I only simmered the sauce and meatballs about 30 minutes.  I really liked the texture of the cooked meatballs - not mushy or dry.  I do agree that more sauce would be nice, so I may try doubling the sauce next time.  I will also try adding some parsley, as some have.

Added a little nutmeg and allspice with a dash of cayenne pepper used some leftover coffee from the morning. Kids scarfed this one down.

Delicious.  I didn't add the instant coffee as I don't use it and had none on hand. . I cooked the meatballs until done and then only warmed them in the sauce for approximately 8 minutes and then served over rice. My family all agreed a definite do over!  Thanks for sharing!
