This was cooked at 4 hours and had started to stick a bit, so watch your time.  I'm not a huge fan of steel cut oats, but decided to use them for this recipe. The fresh blueberries really held their shape and give you a real pop of sweetness.  Be sure to mash your bananas well; I didn't, thinking they would break down when cooking, but they didn't.  It was a little thick, so I did thin out after I took the photo by adding some water to get the consistency we like.  I've tried a number of slow cooker oatmeal recipes, and this one actually might be my favorite.

This is such an easy yummy recipe with great natural sugar in it. The second time I made it I used 3 bananas,  2 cups of old fashioned rolled oats, 2 cups of almond milk, and cooked it for about 3.5 hours on low. So yummy!!!

A WINNER! This is really good oatmeal. 

The beauty of this recipe is you can adjust so many of the ingredients to suit your taste. For example, instead of 2 cups fresh blueberries I substituted 2 cups mixed berries because I had a little bit of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. I also added more cinnamon because we love cinnamon.
 
As another reviewer suggested, it is prone to stick, so I added 1/2 cup more almond milk and 2T butter. It still stuck a little but not much.

I had leftover and it rewarms well in the microwave.

I made this for my son and he scored 3 times during his lacrosse evaluations, so now we joke that it's his pre-game super fuel. It is! I have changed it only slightly - I use 1.5cups of water and 1.5 cups of almond milk. I put it on high for 4-5 hours and it's good to go.

For my first recipe with steel oats, I think it turned out well! I did add more banana off the bat. Next time Iâ€™ll adjust the spices for some additional flavor. We served ours with blueberries, and it was delicious!

This recipe has potential.  I didn't care too much for the blueberries because they turned to mush from the cooking process.  I think using a firmer fruit may work a bit better.  I also added a handful of dried cranberries to add a bit more flavor to the dish

This is super easy and taste amazing!  next time I'll do like another review said and change the water and milk to 1 1/2 cups. And maybe half the blueberries and one more banana like another reviewer said. And just a bit more honey and it'll be perfect!!

Very filling and simple to make. I omitted the honey, which wasn't the best idea, but the oats tasted good regardless.

I made this exactly per the recipe (because how can you rate it honestly if you make changes and rate it based on your changes???); I didn't care for it - not much flavor and the blueberries turned to mush.  I couldn't taste the bananas at all, and I used large, ripe ones.  I avoid adding too much sweet to my food, but this needed more SOMETHING.  Since I'm not about to throw away a dish that used up so many good blueberries, I doctored it up so I could eat it.  So after I put a serving in a bowl, I add about a tablespoon of pure maple syrup, a few blueberries, and some banana slices.  Much better.

I made some minor changes.  First, I highly recommend spraying the crock of the slow cooker with non-stick spray.  I used all plain almond milk instead of part water and omitted the honey since we needed to cut the sugar.  Since I used quicker-cooking steel cut oats, I was able to reduce the time quite a bit. I used frozen blueberries from our farm, and they held together surprisingly well.  This was great when reheated the next day.  Thanks for a very good recipe!

Super easy and yummy! As suggested by other reviewers, I added a 3rd banana for extra flavor and 2 T of butter so it wouldn't stick so much. I didn't have blueberries so I used frozen peaches instead. I think this would be great to use any fruit in. Next time I will add dried cranberries.

Tasty but too thin as is, I did add some dried cranberries for another pop of flavor. I will probably make again & try reducing the liquid. I also used a slow cooker liner so clean up was a breeze.

The taste was okay, and the assembly was easy enough, but this just didn't wow me. I also wish that I'd only cooked it for like 4 hours instead of all night, since all of the oats wound up sticking to the bottom of the slow cooker.

I liked the novelty and simplicity. We did 7 hours and it was a bit gummy. No fault of the recipe, although, without a timed start and stop, it's really not a "ready when you wake" meal for 7/8 hour a night sleepers.  It was not amazing but it was different and everyone still had a nice breakfast together. I love banana in my oatmeal but I'm not sold on it this way. Maybe as a topping.  It was nutritious and there is room for play. Do yourself a favor and use a crockpot liner!

i made this for bf's breakfast and it came out pretty tasty despite not having the blueberries.. i reduced the water and milk (unsweetened coconut) to 1.5 cups each as others suggested and i used about 1.5-1.75 cups mashed bananas that i had previously frozen.. subbed 4 packets of sweetener for the honey (trying to cut back on sugar) but followed the rest of the ingredients/amounts.. i made this in our smallest crockpot that only has an on/off switch.. it was done in about 3.5 hours.. bf said he really liked the banana flavor.. ty for the recipe

I will make this again. I added a little more salt and added a little sugar to sweeten a bit more but that's personal preference. No one else in my family liked it

I had houseguests, so made half-again the recipe, except just two bananas. Next time I'll decrease the liquid just a little, but it certainly wasn't bad this way. Will definitely make again. Cooked 8 hours on low.
