I made a larger quantity to fit a 9 x 13 baking dish.  I lined the dish with parchment paper, then mixed all the ingredients, added a little bit extra cheese than what was called for, put the mixture into the baking dish, patted it down, and baked it for 30 minutes.  After cooling, I picked up the parchment paper at the sides, and set it on the counter.  Then I cut it into strips.  We ended up dipping and then covering our individual slices with spaghetti sauce...omg...amazing!

Love this recipe.  I've tried the bigger version before, but this bite-size held together much better.  I didn't have fresh mozzarella so I used the grated stuff that comes in a can.  I also  threw in some  feta cheese.  I put in some spices called "pizza seasoning" into the crust.  I used squeeze garlic verses the garlic powder.  we had some cooked hamburger and tiny pepperoni so I threw that on for a topping.  Even my hubby who is disgusted by these type of bread replacement recipes liked them!  This will be our new Friday night pizza go-to.

I made this for my parents who must eat gluten free. My dad hadn't had pizza in a long time and he said it was a success! My mom said it was tastier than some pizzas she's had from restaurants. I made it as written except cut the mozzarella in the "dough" to a half cup, and spread it (on parchment) like a traditional round pizza instead of using a muffin tin. After 15 minutes of cooking, I flipped it and cooked it an additional 5 minutes. Then I added the toppings and cooked long enough to melt the cheese on top. I felt the other ingredients and spices were perfect as written. As a second option, we have used some cheddar in the topping cheese and used sweet peppers and onions...yum!

I missed an important direction but these still came out delicious! 

Make sure to cook crust until GOLDEN BROWN otherwise, the pizza comes out mushy (but still tasty).

Also, instead of using parchment paper, I used a silicon muffin mold. It's nice because each little pizza can have different toppings. 

Also - be aware that your house will stink (thanks sulfur) but it's still worth making these treats!

This past year has been a struggle as I attempt to get my family on board with eating gluten free.  It has been one disappointing dish after another...until now.  These cauliflower pizza bites are incredible.  My picky children ate them all and then asked me to make more so they could have a gluten free after school snack.  Incredibly delicious!!!

I shredded the cauliflower in the food processor.  Also added a slice of italian sausage I had previously coooked  between the sauce and cheese prior to rebaking.  I was  short half cup mozzarella cheese  so  I addedd half cup shredded cheddar.   This is delicious and I will make it again.  A good way to lessen carbs.

Only change was to use my pizza baking stone, still using parchment paper, and adjusted cook time (longer). This is the absolute and excellent crust for pizza lovers  who want to avoid the carbs (whether you shred or buy it frozen style). Very important to squeeze the water out. Many variations and can be made to taste. So good, I wrote a review. On this sight daily, and this is the first time I took time to post. Thank you!

I used a small Cauliflower and used a blender, and microwaved it.  Added the cheese like it says, made my own sauce, 3 roma tomatoes and spices, turned out great. I made it in one cup cake tin, 12 pics. My honey loved them and ate too many!!! Great dish and healthy!!

Turned out well and party peeps enjoyed. Made HALF recipe with 1 bag (16oz) Riced Cauliflower; made 12 muffin flexipan crusts. Initial bake might need more than 15 min to get sufficiently browned and dried out to be "crusty".  Still tasted like cauliflower tho. Maybe season the mixture more next time. Topped with sauce, pepperoni slice and cheese.

I’ve made this dish several times.  It took a few times before I simplified the process.   I grate the cauliflower in a food processor, spread in evenly on a large cookie sheet, without a silicone baking mat, and bake @ 375 degrees for 35 minutes, and cool.  My husband found mini & regular size silicone muffin trays.  After spooning the cauliflower into the trays, I use a drinking glass and spin the glass over the mixture to compact it.  We also make this using the mini cupcake tray & have these delicious little bites for appetizers.  Additionally, they store well in the refrigerator for approximately 1week.  Excellent dish, our friends, my husband & I love this dish!

Way too many steps and fuss for the finished product. They don't stay warm very long so don't plan to take them to a pot luck dinner.

Kids enjoyed making this with me. I used 1 bag of cauliflower rice. Next time I will use 2 bags so that the bites are a bit thicker.

Followed the recipe to a T except used homemade pizza sauce.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the crust instead of the onion powder since I didn't have any.  I cut up pepperoni and topped it with that.  They were delicious. My daughter had no idea the crust was made from cauliflower and she absolutely loved them.  I made a few with pesto and goat cheese too and they were amazing!  Next time I'll be getting even more creative with the toppings!

This is so good! I liked that it browned on the bottom. I left it to cook a little longer. I will definitely be making this a family favorite.

This sounds absolutely incredible.  I will buy the riced cauliflower from Green Giant and use it instead. I'm hopeful it will taste just as good and it will be a great time saver.

These were a hit an my New Years party and other times too. I have learned to add a tablespoon(ish) of coconut flour to stabilize the cauliflower base if I don't get all the water out effectively. I didn't have pizza sauce, so I added tiny pieces of salami and sun-dried tomato for fun. Excellent gluten-free snack!

I just made the cauliflower pizza bites. It made easier by using a bag (1 Lb) of cauliflower rice.  I used 1/2 of cheese in the recipe . Also, I greased muffin pan.  Tried to stuff parchment in the pan was too much trouble.
Tasted fine. I will make it again.

I liked it , it was easy to put together.  I like cauliflower well enough but if I make this again I'd add something more to the cauliflower, more salt or garlic, or a tasty cheddar rather than the mozzarella, to reduce the cauliflower-y taste.

I made it as instructed. Browned the top and topped it with chopped scallions, chopped cauliflower and crisp bacon. Without tomato sauce and herbs, all the flavors were dominate. Very good

I let the cauliflower 'rice' stay in the fridge with paper towels to absorb some of the moisture before cooking. I did end up with a lot more cauliflower dough than was needed for 12 servings, though.  

I made no changes, and my veggie-hating husband actually enjoyed them and said that he would eat them again!

We added pepperoni and veggies to our pizza bites. (Everyone in the family made their own favorite pizza on several )  they were devoured and we then moved on to the pizza pin wheels (3 out of 5 do not like cauliflower [and they had no idea until after we finished], pizza pin wheels were back up!  Next time I'll double the recipe and maybe have leftovers)

I made this as an appetizer to bring to a party , it was a hit !  I used a frozen bag of riced cauliflower, thawed it and drained it well. It was great. Delicious!

I made no changes to this recipe.  I did use my own homemade spaghetti sauce.  It took me longer to get this made than the recipe suggested, so next time I make them (and I will) I plan to purchase the cauliflower already shredded.

Took the advice of one review and made them into 1' wide bread sticks.   Made 2 batches on two separate large sheet pans, and pressed the mixture in to a rectangle shape.  Baked for 8 - rotated - Baked for 8 again - rotated and baked another 4 until golden brown, then added the remaining mozzarella and baked again until golden brown - broiled it at the end to get a nice browned cheese. Removed from oven and used parchment to lift off of the cookie sheet.  This cools very slowly and we were in a hurry so just laid the entire thing in the freezer to firm up.  Then we cut strips using a scissors.  We dipped into sauces at the party (most spread sauces on top of the sticks but you could use these sticks and dip into any kind of sauce).  Delicious!

Did not make any changes, was delicious, took them to a pool party.   Put the cauliflower in the VitaMix just a bit at a time, did an excellent job to get the right consistency.

These were a big hit at a covered dish dinner. I made several different types of toppings on them. I had a problem with them sticking to muffin cups and cutting parchment and putting it in the muffin pans was a pain. I just got silicone muffin cups and can't wait to make it again. Silicone muffin pans might even work better.

I had a frozen 12 oz bag of riced cauliflower that I used for this recipe which I cooked in the microwave once it was thawed, then allowed it to cool and squeezed out as much water as I could...it didn't look like there was enough left, but it worked out perfectly. I mixed it with the ingredients listed plus some extra oregano since I didn't have any onion powder and patted it into a parchment lined baking pan 7.5" x 9.5" that fits into my toaster oven. Topped with some extra Parmesan, more mozzarella  and black olives, it was delicious... I cut into 18 squares. Very filling & tasty with a nice salad! I was surprised at how much like pizza that this tastes like, and could not tell that the crust was cauliflower at all. 
I am going to freeze the leftovers for later and definitely will make this again.

These are very good. I followed reviewer advice to bake the cauliflower rather than wrap it in a towel. I followed another reviewer tip to compress the cauliflower into the muffin cups with a glass. I was happy with the results. They are pretty sloppy until they cool completely.

Since I'm dairy sensitive, we made it with Daiya mozzarella. They turned out absolutely fantastic!! We will make these again and again. You won't believe the  "crust" is cauliflower.

This was excellent!  I followed Luvtocreate's suggestions but without the parchment paper.  I used a buttered rectangular glass baking dish and baked it for about 35 minutes.  This is something I'll definitely be making again.

I used 'muffin top' pans (sometimes called whoopie pie pans). worked great. I also didnt bother to cook the cauliflower first, and it worked fine (I DID use a convection oven to dry things out). made standard pepperoni and bbq chicken versions. delish!! it's easier to eat if you julienne pepperoni if you use it.

These had quite a bit of steps to make but if you got the time it is worth a try. 
You could easy turn these bites into a full cauliflower crust pizza. 
I don’t think I squeezed enough moisture out of the cauliflower because it didn’t stick together very well nor were they very crispy like I thought they would be. On some of the bites I put BBQ sauce and cheddar for a different flavor. 
I like that I got my kids to eat some vegetables without too much pain.

It was a messy beginning with the cauliflower. I did not grate the cauliflower, I used my food processor. Once mixed I put some in muffin tin as suggested, and the remaining into a round cake pan. All baked well, very good taste. A healthy snack or meal for lunch. 4 stars.

I was blown away at these little pizzas. I added my favorite pizza toppings, bacon, jalapenos, blue cheese and cilantro. They were better than regular pizza. I didn't want the extra carbs from the tomato or pizza sauce, so I simmered a small amount of spices from a spaghetti seasoning packet in a little water and put a scant teaspoon on each one.  Also, I didn't want to deal with a cupcake pan, so I put them on a cookie sheet and spread them the size I wanted and had little pizzas. Yum, yum!

It was very tasty, even my husband that doesn’t care for cauliflower liked it. I used a cookie scoop to place the crust in the parchment lined tin and used a small gravy ladle to compress and shape it. Reduced the mess and worked to easily shape it.

Getting the moisture all out of the cauliflower was a bit time consuming but they turned out great and I added a piece of pepperoni to them for a little more flavor.
Yes, I would make them again.

I made these twice hoping the second time would work out better than the first. It was the shells that did not cooperate with me. The first time I used the parchment paper and they stuck to the paper so could not use them. So I tried a second time using the cheese directly on the cookie sheet. That didn't work either! So both times I ended up with a taco salad...

I've brought these bites to two potlucks in a month and people really loved these. Yes it is quite time consuming to make but well worth the effort!

Followed ingredients, except for Parmesan (I was out).  Used parchment and made one large crust. Cooked up beautifully golden brown and smelled delicious while baking. Used a homemade sauce and shredded mozzarella. Very tasty.  It is quite fussy to make (not just this recipe, but all of the cauliflower crust recipes I read).  Results were well received by DH.

Did some with meat and some without. Great Taste. 
Gave 4/5 stars because it stuck to the muffin pan so badly I had to throw one out even though it never said to grease them.

I followed someone’s suggestion to make it in a 9 x 11 pan lined with parchment and that worked well. Tasted ok, but too messy and time consuming for a mediocre result. Won’t make this again.

It was so good.  I  added leftover Italian sausage/onion/black olives that I made for a pizza previously and topped with a little parma cheese.

It was Okay,I made it in a glass rectangle dish, and potatoes with salad on the side ,added some extras to our liking, but I agree with the other reviewer -it takes forever to make ...and its just okay... the prep time takes  way too long -not for weekday cooking that's for sure. Don't know if I would make it again ....I think I will keep looking for new cauliflower recipes.

This sounds like a great low-carb recipe!  Does anyone know if the shells can be frozen? ( We're a 2 person household.)

I would make it cassorole style as the I didn't have parchment squares and I used muffin cups but they stuck too much.
The flavour is delicous, we only added our fav pizza toppings, olive, mushroom, pepporoni.
