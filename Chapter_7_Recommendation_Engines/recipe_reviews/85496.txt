Well, I am happy to say that *my* day wasn't ruined by this drink... I had it icy cold, and really enjoyed it. It was very refreshing, and the cucumber was delicious. I'll definitely be adding this to the summer drink rotation. Thanks!

If I could, I'd give this zero stars! I made it for my whole family and friends we invited over as a surprise. I'm sorry but it ruined my day.

This is wonderful. Very light and refreshing. Another cucumber drink idea is to add slices of cucumber to a glass of ice water... much better than water with lemon.

This was a great refreshing punch.  It has to be served immediately.  It is not something that you can have around for a few days because the cucumbers tend to take over the entire taste.  However, I served it for one of my employee celebrations and my entire team loved it.  Use plenty of ice.  Great idea!

I made this for a crowd, and people seemed to enjoy this -I know I did! This is very refreshing, a little unusual but not so weird that noone will try it. I changed the recipe a bit, though. Here's what I used, if anyone's interested: 2 -32 oz fresh lemonade, 1 -12 oz can of frozen white grape juice concentrate, 2 bottles of carbonated water (I like soda to be sparkly!), thin slices of english cucumber, skins on -no water or ice cubes, I just kept everything in the freezer until slushy before serving.

This punch is fantastic! I made it for a large party and all loved it ages 3-100! (It was a 100th birthday party!) We went thru 6 batches! This is light refershing punch is definately a keeper!! I didn't change a thing. After ther party people were hovered around the empty bowl eating the cucumbers exclaiming how delicious they were after soaking in the punch.

Made this punch for a reception of 200+ people.  I used canisters of Kool-Aid instead of the packets, but followed everything else exactly.  I think I had 200+ compliments.  Rumor had it that it was fresh squeezed lemonade and others said it was the best punch they'd ever had.  I couldn't keep up making it.  It's a keeper!

Yum. I used fresh lemonade instead of sugar-free mix, adjusted the water a bit and used baby cucumbers. Really different, pretty, refreshing, and simple. Thanks for the recipe!

This punch was fantastic!! It's so refreshing and easy to make....the only thing I changed was that I added some vodka to make it an "adult" punch....I served the drink in a chilled martini glass with a cucumber slice on the glass as a garnish...I used unflavored vodka, but I know that Smirnoff makes a white grape flavored vodka so next time I would like to try that...all in all it was a huge hit!

My family loved this with a few modifications! I added 2 pkgs of lemonade Kool-Aid and a little sugar and it was very refreshing. The cukes added just that little kick to it without being overpowering. Will definitely try it again!!

So delicious; I'm glad I ignored my gut and trusted the previous reviewers.   This was a hit at the party; gin compliments the punch well for those needing some high-test drinks!

I changed it slightly to make it even easier and a little less sweet.  Just pour all into bowl:  1 bottle lemonade, 1 bottle grape juice, 1 L bottle seltzer water, 1/2 cucumber sliced, ice.  I wish I let the cucumbers marinate a little longer before serving for a little more cucumber taste.  Everyone loved it.

This is a great punch. I've even served it at a Bridal Brunch - it went really well with light breakfast foods. Everyone who I've served it to loves it and always wants the recipe.

I wish there was a name that fits better than "punch". This delicious beverage is more than water with a hint of flavor, but less than a kid's party sweet punch.  It's the right refreshment to keep drinking all afternoon - on a deck with a friend, at a party with a crowd, with a meal, or even spiked for a late night crowd.  I made cucumber ice cubes by freezing 1/2 filled trays, setting in unpeeled cuc. slices, then adding the other 1/2 of water & final freezing. So when I served, I had lots of (regular) ice in a glass pitcher, peeled cucumber slices, lemon slices, and a few cucumber ice cubes.  Very pretty!  I'll be making this again!  Thanks, KimmieOrlando!

This was a very good recipe, but I think it needs more grape juice. (I doubled it.) It wasn't really that yummy after the cucumbers had been in it for a while, so make sure to add them just before you serve it. Otherwise it was very good.

We made this for a baby shower and it was delightful.  It looks AND tastes really good, with subtle lemon and cucumber.  Original + tasty.

This was good.  I made it for Super Bowl and everyone commented on how refreshing it was but didn't seem to go for a second glass.  I thought it was different and do plan on making it again but maybe just for the immediate family!  :)

I haven't tried this actual recipe, but i made a variation of it, and it was REALLY good!  i've always thought of a punch as being fizzy.....carbonated, so i decided to modify this recipe.  here's what i did: -5 cups sierra mist -1 liter seltzer water -1 11.5 fl.oz. white grape PEACH concentrate Mix all those and float the lemon and half cuc on top.  i let it sit like that for a bit and then added about a quart of ice at the last minute.  Got lots of compliments.  Thanks to whoever posted the original recipe!  couldn't have come up with mine if it hadn't been for yours!  :-)

Everyone loved this, but I can't really give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used real lemonade (a bottle of Simply Lemonade), and added a liter of club soda to cut the sweetness and add some fizz.  It was great!

This was OK, I must admit... I was skeptical to try this, but the idea of a light, summer drink with the addition of cucumber (which I love - the taste AND smell) sounded very refreshing. While I thought this was "OK", my bf (who I didn't expect to care for this anyways) said it smelled and tasted like one of my "girly soaps". I must admit that it DID smell a lot like my freshwater cucumber shower gel.... I liked this, but not nearly enough to ever make again (we have LOTS of leftovers even though I made a half batch). Sorry, not for us, but thanks for sharing such a neat idea!

Very disappointing. 
I thought that since it sounded unique, it would probably be good. It tasted like way-too-sweet lemonade with a tiny hint of cucumber.

Following the recipe didn't really work for this punch. I had only put in half the water (but all the lemonade and grape juice) when I tasted it, and it was very watery.  After I put in the amount of water it asked for but twice the lemonade and grape juice, it was delicious! I also added green grapes. They sunk to the bottom, but were fun and delicious to eat! The best part about this punch was eating the cucumbers afterward.

Very good if made with the white grape concentrate "cocktail" rather than the 100% juice.  (Can is more yellow.)  The cocktail version is milder and pleasant.  The version with the 100% juice can be pretty harsh.

Great tasting beverage! I made it per recipe once and once with swapping Granny Smith apple slices for the cucumber. Both versions were very refreshing!

this was wonderful!!!  it is such a light, refreshing summer drink.  it's more like a flavored water than a punch.  i served it at 2 parties & it will be a frequent offering in the future.  thank you for the recipe.

VERY easy recipe for kids to make - my daughter made it and was SOOOO proud of herself.  Could have been a touch sweeter for my taste but all in all a tasty treat.  Makes a PUNCH BOWL FULL...  We ate the cucumbers before storing leftovers in the fridge since other reviews said if left in they turn yuck.

This drink was absolutely wonderful.  It did taste a little strong until some of the ice melted, so I'd definitely add the recommended ice (maybe a tad bit more water).  Refreshing, healthy, and different!  I was surprised at how much flavor half a cucumber would add to the drink!

I didn't really get to follow the recipe. First thing, I couldn't find frozen white grape juice, I didn't see that coming. I used a bottle of white grape juice so I think the flavor of the drink is not the same as the original recipe. It is ok but I will have to find the concentrate.

It was a hit at my party.  My husband was really skeptical too about the cucumbers. I agree with others that half an English cucumber thinly sliced is a good idea. I couldn't get concentrate white grape juice,  and substituted a ready made bottle.

Made this for my sister's baby shower and it turned it great!  Our local grocery story doesn't carry frozen white grape juice concentrate so we just substituted pre-mixed white grape juice from a bottle and combined with lemonade mix and water to taste. Made it a little strong so the ice could melt in the large drink dispenser without turning it watery too fast. SO GOOD!

I accidentally used white grape juice instead of concentrate but it still turned out good! I recommend letting it chill in the fridge overnight before drinking. Perfect for a hot summer Texas day!

If I could, I would give this recipe 6 stars! I was having a bad day and after I made this drink, the sun came out and my emotional state was saved! the cucumbers are so pretty and it's white so it is good for children and carpets. its light and refreshing flavor fits any occasion. for some extra fizz in your life add some Sprite or ginger ale. Hooray for life altering cucumber punch!!!!!

I made this for my graduation party in December. I wanted something sweet and refreshing that was pretty and different. This was perfect! I served it in a big glass thing with a stand and a spout, and it was stunning!

I read all the really great reviews before making this and unfortunately I was really dissapointed.  It did not ruin my day, but I will not be making this recipe again. It was drinkable and just o.k.  We had lots left over because no one wanted any more.
