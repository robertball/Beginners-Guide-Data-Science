Yummy and easy for 2!! I use 1 pound of asparagus, add roasted garlic, sea salt and toss with all of the vinegar in a baking dish and spray with an olive oil "cooking spray" - stir half way thr. Bake time watch - it will change depending on the "thickness" of the spears.

We are on a huge "roasted" vegetable phase right now and these were delicious.  The tops get nice and crispy, yet the stems and insides stay firm but moist. Wonderful!

good recipe. I had never roasted asparagus before and was very pleased with the results. None of this dunking them in ice water buisness. The asparagus was still nice and crisp and the oil and vinegar really brought out the flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to lightly sautee the shallots with some fresh garlic before putting in the oven.

Great base.  I didn't have any shallots or red wine vinegar so I just had olive oil and S&P.  I sprinkled some lemon juice on them when they came out of the oven.  Yummy!!

This was great and easy. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like asparagus actually complimented me on this dish! I didn't have shallots but substituted garlic, which worked out great. I also used the kosher salt.  Because I was cooking something else at 500 degrees, I cooked this at 500 degrees for 10-12 min on the top rack.

Very good and easy recipe!  Just make sure you don't overbake (like I did....they got a little shrively, but that was totally my fault).  A nice way to dress up asparagus!

I did the recipe almost exactly but only had 1 shallot on hand. And I just eyeballed the oil & vinegar. Even so, it was delicious! Hubby loved it too - will def. make it again.

Simple preparation for a vegetable that should shine on it's own merits. The shallots were a great addition. I did not have red wine vinegar so I subbed in Balsamic, and it was great.

This recipe was very easy and delicious!  My family loved it and many requested the recipe.  The first time I made it, the cooking length of time may have been too long.  It became soggy but the flavor really soaked in the asparagus. Luckily, my boyfriend prefers the asparagus soggy.  If you prefer a crunchier side of the asparagus, I would cook it a few minutes less.  

  The second time I cooked it, I tried to sautee it on the stove.  It was crunchier but the red-wine vinegar didn't really soak it on.  I added a few more drizzle when I turned off the fire.  It was delicious!  Highly recommend this recipe if you like easy and big on flavor asparagus!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was wonderful!  I served it with a beef tenderloin last night, and everyone raved about the flavor of the asparagus.  I wouldn't do anything differently, and will definitely make this often.

Very tasty! I skipped adding the vinegar at the end because there was still enough vinegar flavor for me after roasting.  The shallots got all carmelized in the pan and were a delicious topping after scraping them up out of the pan.

I do this recipe a little different. I use Basalmic vinegar instead of red wine ( i used what i had) I also added basil, chopped onion and garlic and garlic salt. Towards the end of cooking I put a small amount of melted butter over the top to brown up alittle. Delicious!

These were delicious!  I did add some minced garlic, seasoned salt and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  The roasting really carmelizes the shallots, and makes these asparagus spears tender and delicious.  This went very well with our ham and potatoes on Easter.  Highly recommend this recipe!

This is a good recipe - and tasted great with barbeque chicken thighs and small red potatoes. I made the recipe as directed - and agree with other reviewers that the time for cooking is way too long (might depend on the diameter of the asparagus). Generally I find 8 to 10 minutes roasting time to be adequate for most asparagus at the temperature indicated - this was no exception.

I followed this recipe to a T and was very happy with it.  I had never roasted asparagus and it was delicious.  I almost forgot the final splash of vinegar - and I'm glad I didn't because I think it added something.  The shallots were awesome.

Great recipe. Make sure you use fresh asparagus, not canned or frozen. If you use canned, you really haven't made this recipe, so don't complain when it doesn't turn out and then give it a poor rating. It's not the recipe's fault if you don't follow directions. There is a huge difference between the canned and fresh asparagus or canned and fresh anything, actually. Too bland? Spice it up a bit. This recipe can be made to your spice tolerance.

I served this alongside a grilled prime rib this weekend.  The roasting intensifies the asparagus's mild flavor.  Garnished it with fresh cracked pepper and shavings of Parmesan cheese.

I thought this was so-so.  But I did overcook the asparagus and it's not my favorite veggie to begin with.  Maybe if you really love asparagus this is a great way to serve it, but if you're not a big fan then this probably isn't going to get you to like it.

Simple and flavorful, all my guests raved. (if they only know how easy it was) Line your pan with foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray for easy clean up.

I really like this recipe, but I leave off the last splash of vinegar. I also find that the asparagus is done after about 14 minutes in the oven.

I made the mistake of using canned asparagus.  It was awful.  The canned asparagus was soggy and gooey--very disgusting.  I liked the flavor mixture though, so I'll probably try this again with fresh asparagus, but never again with canned.

Served this for Easter Dinner yesterday as a side to Christine's Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin (Yum).  It was extremely easy to prepare and very flavorful. Hard to mess up unless you just forget to watch it.  Pretty too; I guess the roasting part brings out the deep green color of the asparagus.

Reduced the recipe in half and this still made a ton. Added fresh minced garlic as well and topped with a little shredded Parmesan. Went well with grilled filet mignon.

Not impressed at all - I cut the cooking time down a lot & the asparagus was still mushy. Too bad :(

I would have given this 3 stars, but I did't use the shallots so I'll give it 4 to compensate. This wasn't bad, but it wasn't incredibly good, either. It -was- different from my basic steamed asparagus I normally make, and it was nice for a change of pace, but I probably won't make this again.

Very good and very easy. I blanched my asparagus first without the shallots and then immediately placed them in ice water to stop the cooking process. I then patted them dry and placed them back in the refrigerator to prepare later that eventing. This way they only had to cook for a short time as I needed my oven for other dishes. I tossed them with the shallots in olive oil, salt, and pepper and then roasted for about 4 minutes. Delicious!
