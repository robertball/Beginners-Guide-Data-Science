These were quite good cookies with a great texture. I was a little disappointed that in spite of all the good things in them they were a little bland. I think next time I might try some peanut butter instead of all the oil. You definately must mix these in a dishpan! I am sure the amount of cookies is wrong as I used a 1/4 c. to scoop the dough and ended up with 5 doz monster sized cookies that did disappear quickly.

So so yummy! One of the best cookies ever to come out of my oven. I will revise my rating to 5 stars when I figure out how to keep them from flattening out. Truly Awesome cooked but the uncooked batter ROCKED!!!

I love this cookie recipe. I make a double recipe divide it into smaller batches with a wide variety of add-ins. We love butterscotch chips and coconut in one chocolate chip chips and pecans in another Reese's peanut pieces in another and from there I just use my imagination. My kids always thought they were different recipes. They had had no idea it was always the basic dishpan recipe. M & Ms White chocolate craisins raisins and nuts.... They are all really good options to mix & match with.
