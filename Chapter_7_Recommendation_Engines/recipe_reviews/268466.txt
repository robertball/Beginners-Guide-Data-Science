This was incredible! Even without the Detroit baking pan ( I used the largest glass casserole dish I could find 11x14), it was an amazingly good pizza. I will be writing this one in my "favorite recipes" book.

I live just outside of Detroit, like a half mile from the border. You gotta come here and go to Louie's in Hazel Park for pizza. Buddy's is also a staple here. People think Detroit is in shambles and it's really not. We have so many great restaurants here! I like how you pronounced it Deetroit. ?? Everyone that's not from here does.

To be honest, never had Chicago style. My husband is a New Yorker, so I know pizza.I got the pan ( well worth it) made my own sauce . Had mozzarella cheese on hand so I used that. We love it. Made twice now. Very good. We live in the middle of nowhere West Virginia, so this recipe is a pizza lover's dream. Thank you for the introduction to Detroit style, it’s a keeper for sure.

Chef John, youv'e done it again!  This recipe is absolute Detroit perfection. I might suggest sprinkling on some bits of browned hot sweet Italian sausage out of the casings before the last layer of pepperoni. Awesomely simple!

Really good! My Detroit pan is 40 yrs old and that makes a huge difference. Also, my friends send me brick cheese from Detroit so I used that. But, next time I'll try the combo you used. Great job, Chef John!

Another great recipe from Chef John! I've made it twice now. All in all, the dough is easy to make and work with, even if you make it by hand. If you prefer your crust golden brown instead of golden black, stick to 10 minutes at 500. I think canola or vegetable oil is preferable to olive oil in the pan to prevent a burnt crust. We found the sauce excessively spicy (we were sweating), so we cut down on the chili flakes a bit the second time around.

We didn't have the correct pan.  I split the dough in half, and used two separate round 10" baking pans that were nice and deep.   I made one pizza for my daughter without the pepperoni (she's vegetarian) and made the second pizza with vegan pepperoni and a vegan shredded cheese blend.  Even the vegan version ended up with nice crispy "burnt cheese" edges. 
Chef John is right, you really are basically "frying" the pizza dough in the pan, thanks to the oil.  Don't skimp on the oil! 
If I make it again I will leave off the pepperoni.

Having trouble with the amount of water to bread flour, dough is very dry, I’m adding more water but the dough is not sticky or smooth. My first attempt ended in the trash because I thought my bread flour was too old. Anyone else experiencing this?

I did it with a Cast Iron pan and it was Amazing! I used fresh pepperoni from the local market, my homemade tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes, loaded on some black olives and a ton of cheese. I had leftover sauce that got better and better as time went on. Definitely doing this again!

Excellent recipe. Great for parties since it goes a long way. Use a nice sauce, not the cheapest one on the grocery rack that's loaded with sugar. I added crumbled, cooked sausage and used Napolitana Tipo 00 flour.

This pizza was just awesome!  I used turkey pepperoni, mushrooms and black olive.   This has instantly become a favorite in our household. It doesn’t matter what toppings you use,  we left some pieces just plain and they were great too.

Awesome recipe. In addition to pepperoni i used sausage and mushrooms. Failed to purchase the jack cheese so I used chunked extra sharp cheddar and slightly frozen shredded mozzarella. I froze it so it would take longer to melt with the chunked cheddar. Absolutely delicious!!  Keeper recipe!!  Thank you!

So good.  I make “regular” pizza often, but I might only make the Detroit-style from now on. The cheesy crusty edges are the best.

I always make my own pizza crust but usually do a thinner crust. Decided to try something different and glad I did. My family loved this and so did I.  Another winner from Chef John.
