A nice warm sandwich.  I used less butter/margerine and substituted hot dog buns.  Also any cheese (diced cheddar for example) seems to work

I've had these since childhood. My mom called these "Bunsteads". I now make them for my family. The recipe is the same except I put the filiing in hot dog buns with no butter. An excellent way to use canned tuna.

I was planning on making a tuna sandwich so I thought I would check to see if I was missing out on another way to prepare it by using this most helpful website!! And yes good sandwich, tasty, I tend to burn my buns!! so the tin foil prevented this from happening!!

My family ate these up like crazy!  It was surprising, and totally delicious.

Hubby liked them the most out of all of us...they were ok, but I thought there was too many conflicting flavors going on. My only change was to use leftover hot dog buns in place of the burger buns. Thanks for sharing. :)

Everyone except our 8 year old enjoyed this--then again she isn't the biggest fan of tuna fish. My husband thought this was incredible!

This wasn't bad, just nothing spectacular enough for a four or five star rating.
