This recipe is really great! There is no cream of broccoli soup so I just replaced it with a cream of chicken soup then didnt precooked the broccoli. It still turned out great coz the broccoli was just half-cooked - exactly the way I want my veggies to be. Also added a teaspoon of pepper, some garlic and a bit of salt. I will definitely cook this recipe again!

Very quick, healthy comfort food. About as delicious as you can get from frozen broccoli and canned soup (and I mean that as a compliment). I love broccoli, so I used a 16oz bag. I thought about combining the broccoli and milk/soup mix, then spooning over the fish to bake as I was afraid it might not combine well layered, but that's not needed: the soup seeps down into the broccoli while keeping the fish nice and moist. I actually forgot to use shredded cheese (heresy!) but that turned out great too: after baking we scooped up our portions and sprinkled the cheddar ourselves, letting it melt on top. A yummy meal I had prepped in  minutes on a busy night loaded with protein, cheese, and the most spectacular vegetable of all - a five star meal if I've ever seen one. Thanks for sharing!

Both my husband and myself loved this recipe. I substituted sour cream for the milk and used Old Bay seasoning on it instead of paprika. Will definately have again!

I pretty much changed a lot but it came out great. After reading the other reviews about the dish tasting blah I took the suggesting of seasoning the fish. I seasoned with garlic powder and curry powder. I also added a tablespoon of garlic and 1/4 cup of onion to the soup mixture. I also threw in some peas with the broccoli. I doubled the crumble topping, forgot the cheese and used cream of chicken soup. It came out A-MAZING!

We really liked this recipe. I used havarti cheese and added garlic powder,salt pepper and lemon seasoning to the bread crumbs. Definitely  will make this again. Will try cauliflower next time.

My husband LOVED this. I sprinkled some Old Bay Seasoning on top when completed (because I forgot that I wanted to put it directly on the fish before the soup mixture) I used Cod, but I think next time I am going to use Orange Roughy becuase we like that fish better (less fish taste we think).

Amazing recipe!! I added Added Cayenne pepper to the soup mix + Garlic powder + Oregano.  I also used fresh broccoli since I like the taste better (boiled it for a few minutes first).  AFTER it came out of the oven, I threw some pepper jack cheese on top. Man, it's SOO EASY AND DELICIOUS!! LOVE IT!! THANKS!! =D

I wasn't crazy about this. My husband loved it though. I used cod & couldn't taste anything but a strong fish taste, which is not a preference for me. I will probably try it again with a different fish just to see if maybe something was off, but otherwise, it wasn't a dish for me.

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make and the ingredients are easy to substitute. I made it once with asparagus instead of the broccoli and cream of celery soup instead of broccoli soup. I have followed the recipe using tilapia fish and I have tried with basa. Very good every time!

Made with cream of Mushroom soup, milk and a touch of sour cream and 1 cup of Montery Jack cheese, doubled bread crumbs and used fresh broccoli and cauliflower with Basa Fillets. Increased time by 10 mins. as fillets were not quite thawed through fully. Seasoned fillets with herb and garlic Mrs Dash before covering with soup mixture. Served over rice. Easy and Delicious and everyone loved it..will def make again!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I seasoned the fish with Old Bay and Pepper, added garlic salt to the bread crumb mix and used sour cream with about 4 tablespoons of milk with the cream of Broccoli. Boyfriend loves cheese so I used much more than a 1/4 cup. Going to try with a lighter fish next time, maybe tilapia as someone else suggested. Served with rice. Very healthy!

Absolutely delicious. Definitely use Old Bay seasoning instead of paprika. My 83 year old father ate 2/3 of the dish, and never spoke a word until he was done, and then all he said was "that is a keeper." His highest compliment.

I used haddock, lightly steamed fresh broccoli, and Healthy Requests Cream of Celery soup (less sodium.) I put some sour cream in as others suggested. For the topping, I put one slice of bread and a handful of Cheese Nips in my mini food processor and mixed the crumbs with butter. It came out awesome!! I'm trying to feed my family more fish so I'm sure we'll have this again. Thanks for the idea! I love allrecipes!

Surprisingly good, but not eye-popping (hence the 4 star rating).  I used fresh broccoli and Swai fish fillets.  Simple and quick, this is a good meal when short on time.

I am admittedly not a good cook and this recipe was easy and good! I used 2 fillets of tilapia fish and kept all of the other ingredients the same since they were big fillets.  This came out great and I will definitely make it again! I would definitely season the fish before adding them though.

I gave this only three stars mostly because I am not a big fan of fish other than salmon. However, it was easy to make and my family really likes it. I read some of the other reviews beforehand and seasoned the fish before baking. French's fried onions made a nice crunchy topping. I have made it twice using tilapia but I think I will try another type of fish next time. Overall easy and a hit with the family.

I added 1 cup diced potato's, 1/2 cup carrot coins. I used 1 can each cream of mushroom and cream of cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of broccoli. 
1 1/2 Lbs. cod thawed, 1 teaspoon Tones Salmon and Seafood Seasoning, 3/4 cup milk, no cheese, 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons melted butter, YUM.

I hate to say but this was just barely ok.  The biggest issue that I had is who wants fish flavored broccoli?  And, the dish as bland BUT on a positive note it was very easy.  Sorry for the bad review.

Great recipe! I used defrosted haddock. I had to bake it for 30 minutes and sprinkled garlic powder on the fish. (I add garlic to any recipe that doesn't include it.) I forgot the breadcrumbs but the paprika on the cheese was fantastic!

Thanks.  Very simple to make.  I think there was too much milk (maybe the milk was unneccesary?) because it turned out very runny, even though I left it in the oven a little longer.

My whole family thought this was really good, which is hard to do with fish in our family. I do think the fish (I used Tilapia) needs to be seasoned before adding the soup. Next time I'll try Old Bay as others have suggested, or maybe some lemon pepper. I didn't cook the broccoli all the way first. I just put it in the microwave for about 3 minutes to get it started. The end result was just how I like my broccoli - barely tender and still a pretty green. I substituted olive oil for the butter with the bread crumbs, and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of broccoli because the store I went to didn't have cream of broccoli. Served over brown rice. A very easy to prepare, satisfying, and healthy fish dinner.

I love this recipe because I can bake the fish and vegetables from FROZEN! This is very easy to change around to make it different every time by adding and subtracting. I made it with cream of mushroom and spinach and it came out really well. I found though it would probably be better to wait to put the cheese, bread crumbs and butter topping on in the last five minutes so it does not spread out all over the place. My husband gave it a 4.5 star, my son gave it a 3, but he's too picky. I gave it a 5. Good dish! Will make again!  Additional note: I have been making this about once a month for the last 4 years. I use any kind of cream soup on hand. I no longer add the butter. The cheese and the breadcrumbs are enough. We never get sick of it.
UPDATE: I made this last night with tomato soup and a drained can of diced tomatoes instead of creamed soup this time and it was SO GOOD! Cheese and breadcrumbs always make this dish awesome.

This was a great dish to do but I did have to change some things. The cheese isnt really needed. I used catfish instead of the other fish options, still came out with good results! Also i changed the broccoli to florets instead of spears. I love this dish.

This was pretty bland.  It's a good base recipe though.  We steamed our broccoli separate, used cream of chicken soup, at least 2x as much cheese, and crushed croutons.  There was too much soup/sauce and not enough of the crunchy topping.  I think next time we'll use at least 3/4 or 1/2 as much soup, and at least 2x as many croutons.  We'll also add more seasonings and spices to give it some more pizazz.

Not the best, but still alright. I definitely have to recommend adding more broccoli to this dish. I did actually add more and it still wasn't enough. You'll probably have to add more cream of broccoli as well, which in my case since I didnt have that, I added more cream of chicken.

I just made this for my Newfie boyfriend who says the only way to eat cod is fried. Lol, he LOVED it, said it was on his top 10 things to eat.                   I changed it a little....I used cream of mushroom soup with greek yoghurt, fried some onions and put on top of the broccoli, put a little pepper on the fish, put a little extra cheese and skipped the crumb topping althogether. Cooked an extra 10 min. Served with Uncle Bens 7 Grain Medley. Made frozen dinners with the leftovers, I told him his 2 big servings was all he could have.

The first time I made this, I used tilapia, and I didn't really care for it, the flavors didn't quite 'mesh' for me - but this time, I used cod, and it was a lot better. I followed others suggestions and used some garlic powder on the fish, and also French's fried onions in place of the bread crumbs. Also I could only find cream of broccoli with cheese, so I omitted the extra cheese. Family liked it a lot, will make again.

I didn't like this recipe at all.. something about fish and brocolli baked together just didn't do it for me. It's not bad if you like the overwhelming taste of fish but for me not so much.   : (

Very good recipe! I use fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and mix a spoon of sour cream with the soup/milk mix.

It was just okay- definitely missing something.  I felt like there should be something else in it.  Too bland for our taste.

I used tilapia and slightly seasoned the fish with salt pepper and seasoning salt and also salted the broccoli. Quick and easy! Boyfriend and I both thought it was tasty!

Great recipe and a hit with my whole family. I used tilapia and seasoned it with pepper and fish seasoning . I used a little less milk and used sharp cheddar and Parmesan cheeses. Easy and ready fast, but still tastes wonderful. I will use this recipe often. I served it with baked potatoes and I think rice would be great too. The leftovers made a good lunch too!

Tried this for a change of pace, but would have preferred just plain baked fish and steamed broccoli over the rich sauciness of the cream soup and cheese.  Maybe I just don't like cream of broccoli soup.

Easy and delicious meal. Served mini croussants to soak up get every bit and fresh strawberries to completed meal. I added more fish and cheese. I used frozen broccoli florets instead of spears. Only spice I added was pepper on the fish. New addition to our meals in my house.

easy, family loved it. I used condensed broccoli cheddar soup since that's all I had and it worked just fine. I served this over instant white rice and it was perfect!

I actually changed a lot in this recipe. I only had two heads of broccoli on hand, so I added a large carrot and two small bell peppers to the broccoli. I had noticed other reviews saying there was not much taste to it, so I added half an onion and garlic powder to the veggies as well. I didn't have any cream of broccoli, so I substituted cream of mushroom soup. I almost never have bread in the house, so I substituted rolled oats for the breadcrumbs. The only thing I added was a little black pepper before serving.

Both me & husband absolutely loved it - might add a bit more broccoli next time, but otherwise no changes at all.  Definitely making this again!

My family loved this. This was a perfect weeknight meal - and called for things I already had on hand. I used frozen broccoli, frozen Swai filets, and Broccoli Cheese Soup. I added salt and pepper to the broccoli and garlic powder to the bare fish. Then followed the directions as written. There were no leftovers, and my kids are toddler to teenager! My husband said this reminded him of his favorite stuffed fish dish at a local restaurant! I'm looking forward to trying different variations others have spoken of, especially with chicken and maybe Greek yogurt instead of milk....

This recipe was okay.  I will try it again - but next time I will not cook my fresh broccoli 1st.  I will put it in the dish raw - since I don't care for over cooked broccoli.  I added a lot of fresh lemon juice after putting it on my plate to cute thru the very fishy (cod) and broccoli taste. (I love lemon)

Followed the recipe as written. Was really bland with cod. And the combination of textures didn't really jive with me. Although, everything minus the fish would make a great side.

I made this recipe because I had some frozen tilapia and I chose this recipe to hide the strong fishy taste of the tilapia that my husband doesn't care for. After reading some of the reviews,I omitted the milk and added plain Greek yogurt,sprinkled the fish with Old Bay seasoning. Added 1/2 cup of a three cheese blend,doubled the bread crumbs,(I used panko crumbs),then I added 1 Tablespoon of chopped fresh tyme,and for the last ingredient I added chopped scallions on the top. Baked it for 25  minutes at 425 degrees in my electric oven. My husband liked it and it hid some if the fishy taste from the tilapia. I will make this again using different fish and I think it would be good with chicken too.

I used fresh broccoli and should have steamed it a little first, but flavor was great!
