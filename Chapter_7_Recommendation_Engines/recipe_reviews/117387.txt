really delicious.  I did double the seasonings and should not have increased
the bread crumbs ( I used corn flake crumbs ).  The increased spices seemed too much until the burgers were all put together and then allll perfect. 
And up-ing the dry ingredients gave me
patties that didn't hold together quite
well enough on the grill. 
This is A KEEPER recipe and is just as good the next day as it was for dinner
the night before.  
Thank you very much for posting it!
oh,..and I used the Worchestershire sauce that says it's for chicken.

This was a great tasting recipe! Grilled them instead of pan frying and they came out moist and tasty.  Used Walkerswood dry Jamacian jerk seasoning and a touch of habanero hot sauce which really kicked up the heat level. Like the previous reviewer, I topped the burgers with homemade mango chutney.  Will definitely make these on the grill a few more times this summer. Thanks for a  great tasting alternative to beef burgers!

These were SO GOOD. I only made two small modifications - we didn't have green onions, so I used Vidalia onions instead. I also added a couple of drops of liquid smoke to the recipe, since I wasn't going to be able to cook them on our grill (it was raining). Delicious!

This is a really good recipe and my entire family, picky kids included, loved it! I used the Pampered Chef Jamaican Jerk rub. Next time, I will add 2 Tbs for more flavor. I made the patties smaller and cooked in the grill pan. The fresh mango is a MUST! It adds great texture and flavor. The burgers were juicy and I would definately make these again. Thanks for a fun recipe!

Tasty Enough... Mango is definitely a must.  I baked mine in the oven at 350 until done.

These were tasty. I used diced white onion instead of green and ended up using the recipe from this site for jerk seasoning because i couldn't find it in the stores. I do think next time I make this I will double up on the spices because it was rather mild. I also used homemade mango chutney instead of whole mango because I had that in the fridge

YUMMY!  We grilled these vs. pan frying.  I did add 1 egg to hold mixture together better.  Will make again!

Very good!  My boys - inc. my husband :) - liked this burger, and they are not turkey burger fans.  A little spicy for the 3 year old, but that was my fault. I should have known better. Still a great recipe.

These burgers were really delish!  I did change the recipe a smidge because I had no mango or red peppers in the house.  I also made my own "jerk" seasoning by combining cayenne pepper, garlic, black pepper and some thyme.

I was a bit skeptical, but WOW - these were to die for! My husband is a big guy who loves to eat, so I'm always a little nervous to try new recipes. He gobbled it up - and so did my son! We blended mango with apple preserves and barbecue sauce to give the burgers some 'juice'. Would also be great with a mango salsa.

Yummy!!!  I followed the recipe to the letter however I made my own Jerk seasoning since I couldn't find it in the store.  Not a problem, making the seasoning was easy and there is a recipe for on this website somewhere.  What's nice is you can adjust the heat intensity if you don't like it too hot but we like it with a kick.  Back to the burgers, they were absolutely great!  I topped them off with a slice of pepperjack cheese and some Razzpotle sauce, mmmm, we were in heaven!!

Very easy, and we both liked them.  The hardest part was shaping into burgers.  I also got 7 burgers, not 4 out of this mix, but bf will tell you I make small burgers.  I am  of the opinion that other people make monster burgers, but what do I know.  Anyway, I used the Jerk Seasoning recipe from this site and it worked well.  I didn't really measure the oil or bread crumbs, but I put a bit more oil in than called for I think, and a bit less bread crumbs.  I also subbed garlic for the onion and mango chutney (on mine only--bf ate his with mayo) for the mango and pepper.  I really liked the mango chutney with the burger and I'm sure mango and pepper would have gone smashingly (although both are in my chutney).  Thanks for the recipe!  Now, thank goodness, I don't have to hear bf repeat "turkey burgers!" at me over and over, which he's been doing ever since he pulled out the darn ground turkey!

These were very good. I used liquid Jerk seasoning because I could not find a powdered one and the jerk flavor came through nicely. I also add some egg white to my turkey burgers which really helps keep them moist. I topped these bad boys off with some Pepper Jack Cheese and some Smoked Cheddar. These are a nice healthy alternative but only real burgers get a 5 star from me.

VERY tasty burgers! I substituted dried cilantro for the parsley,vidalia onion for the green onion and only used half the bread crumbs. Will definitely make this recipe over and over.

This burger is some kind of good. I followed the recipe as directed - other than adding a little oil to the mixure before cooking. A tasty healthy burger that my family loved. I will use this recipe again.

These burgers were very good. We used a jerk seasoning we bought from Fresh Market. We also added a diced Habanero for some extra heat...

Very good, will make again!
