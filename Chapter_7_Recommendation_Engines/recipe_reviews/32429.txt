I used this recipe with one major tweak--I left out the simple syrup entirely.  I don't care for overly-sweet punch.   The lemon-lime soda and the white grape juice add all the sweetness it needs. This recipe, minus the syrup, fit the bill perfectly for a wedding reception I was catering. Guests were surprised that there was no alcohol in the punch- maybe a little disappointed, too! (lol)  Since that wedding reception in Aug 2006, I have made this punch 3 or 4 other times, to great acclaim.  A classy alternative to that yucky red punch we see far too often.

Served at a church Valetine's dinner.  Had so many raves about this fancy drink!!  I added a small spoonful of frozen mixed berries to each glass to fancy it up.  And use the berries frozen so they will serve a little as ice and wont be mushy.

It looked and tasted wonderful. It is great for younger people and older people too. It looked amazing as well. I also left out the surup too, fearing it wouldnt work out well. Instead of the surup I used a bit of sugar. for a bit more sweetness. Over all I think it is a good recipe.

Excellent 5 star punch!  Followed recipe exactly with no tweaking (which is unheard of for me)!  For those who do not know how to make simple syrup, the recipe is also on this site.  Received many compliments and requests for recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

We left out the simple syrup and it was sweet enough.  Not overpowering, esp if you have other sweets on the table.  Lots of compliments on this one, plus it's very easy to make.  Great if you are doing a buffet by yourself....one less thing to think about after you put the ingredients in the fridge.

Left out the simple syrup.  Was quick and easy to make, rave reviews from the guests. Garnish of fruit in an ice ring adds color.
