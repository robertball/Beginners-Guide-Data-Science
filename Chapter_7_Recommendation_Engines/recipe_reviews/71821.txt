When dealing with any eggplant recipe, you need to throughly sweat the mush out of them before cooking by letting them sit, even loner than the general recommended 15-30, to prevent a gooey middle. Extra cooking doesn't help, you just get a charred outside.

No, it's not pizza. HOWEVER... anyone who is doing South Beach knows that you can get very bored very quickly, and this was a nice change from salad w/ vinegar and oil and chicken! It actually reminded me more of eggplant parm. than pizza. Next time, I'll either 1) add oregano to up the pizza flavor, or 2) add parmesan cheese. (Maybe both?)

Delicious!  After peeling & slicing the eggplant, I laid it out on paper towel to dry for about 15 min. while preheating the oven, getting cheese, sauce, etc. I think that and baking the eggplant before topping is key to keeping it from being too mushy.  Excellent alternative to the crust.  AAAAA+++++++++!!!

To save time if you're making this just for yourself, skip the peeling of the eggplant. You can peel it as you eat it or just eat the peel too! You can't get poisoned from eating eggplant peel can you? (I know rhubarb leaves are a no-no.) What memories! I made a recipe similar to this in the 70's when I was a weight conscious teen. Store bought pasta sauce wasn't around back then so I used a simple tomato paste or even ketchup w/oregano.  Okay, we were poor! :-)  Experiment with toppings - this time I used pepperjack cheese and tempeh. I am a low-carb lifer after a 20 lb loss on South Beach over 2 years ago that I've maintained. Yeah!

How awesome! My hubby and I were at that point (11 days into Phase 1) where we were getting tired of salads. This was the perfect change!! The only thing I did differently was jazzed up the sauce with garlic, italian seasoning and red pepper and also sprinkled some reduced-fat parm. cheese over the top. My hubby doesn't even like eggplant (or at least, I haven't been able to cook it right to where he enjoys it...) and he really loved this one! Thanks!~

I thought these were great. I used pizza sauce instead of pasta sauce and added turkey pepperoni and crushed red pepper. To heat them up, I put them in the toaster oven which made them a little crispy.

I made this without the canadian bacon and used my own home-made chunky tomato sauce.  Really reminds me of eggplant parm more than pizza, but I loved it!  I cooked the eggplant on a wire rack set in a cookie sheet so the excess liquid would drain down, then transferred to a baking dish lined with foil to pour the sauce and cheese over.  Delish!

Pretty delicious - and so nutritious! I added ground turkey and mushrooms, my own sauce (diced tomatoes and garlic). Protein packed and low fat.

Pretty tasty. I omitted the meat and used slices mozz. chz. on top and melted it til it was golden brown. I also omitted the oil and baked the eggplant on each side for 4 minutes b/f topping w/ pasta sauce and chz. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I used no fat/no calorie cooking spray in place of the oil and did not use the bacon - and it was still very tasty.

I would say a Five Star, except could be crispier!
None the less- the best thing I've had to eat in almost 2 weeks.
This is a great one to add into Phase One imediately if you havent tried it yet!!

I think this had a nice flavor, but the texture was not appealing to me.  I did sweat the eggplant for several hours.  I think that maybe I just don't like eggplant.

Delicious! But you have to be an eggplant lover to enjoy it. I don't think it's a substitute for pizza by any means, but a nice snack! I used fresh bacon bits, tomato chunks, garlic powder, and shredded cheese. They're even good heated up the next day..or cold!

I thought it was good, I added little pieces of grilled chicken strips on top and hot pepper to my boyfriend's since he loves that. He has already had me make it twice so I guess its a hit!

Erm... Make sure to slice the eggplant thinly. You might like it if you like eggplant, but I found the eggplant to be too strong, and my husband and I ended up just eating the cheese and meat!

I thought these were great. They're not pizza, but I like them better because eating them means I can walk by my reflection in a store window and say "Oh, yeah!" The sauce and cheese made them really yummy. I topped different ones with mushrooms and olives, fresh tomato and pesto, next time I'll try artichoke hearts and feta and some other variations. They were delicious and really filling.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I didn't peel the eggplant.  I used Morning Star Farms sausage-style crumble (vegetarian) instead of the Canadian bacon. I minced and briefly sauteed a few tablespoons of red pepper and onion, plus a couple of sliced mushrooms, and topped the eggplant with that as well.  I used a little shredded cheese, but I think it might be fine without.

If you un-South Beach this recipe, it would be wonderful (dip the eggplant slices in an egg wash, then dip them in a seasoned bread crumb mixture, fry them in extra virgin olive oil, add extra cheese).  However, if I was going to make this again the South Beach way, I'd first toast the eggplant and then add the sauce and cheese and finish baking.  The eggplant was a little mushy.

these are very easy to make and the options are endless for toppings. they were okay, but a little soggy even after laying the eggplant on papertowels for at least 30 minutes before putting into the oven.

These were really good. I didn't use the bacon as I'm vegetarian, and I didn't have any mozzerella so I used low-fat halloumi, which worked well too. I didn't bother peeling the eggplant either, I like the skin.

These were out of this world.  Instead of spaghetti sauce, I used Contadina pizza sauce and sprinkled mozzarella.  I didn't bother with the bacon.  I brought them for lunch at work, and brought a few extra to share.  Two non-dieters said they were heading to the store to buy eggplant that night to try this recipe!  Definitely satisfies my pizza cravings.

Excellent, easy, & filling!  We don't have mozzarella here, so substituted that with a cheese similar to swiss, and it was DELICIOUS!  I definitely recommend letting the sliced eggplant "dry" a bit first.  Thanks for a simple and satisfying recipe.

I didn't miss the bread at all!  I made it with some sauteed chicken breast instead of the canadian bacon, but otherwise just followed the recipe.  It's definitely not finger food, but it's fine with a knife and fork.  I'm not even a big fan of eggplant itself, but the tomato sauce covers the taste and otherwise it tastes just like pizza.

for those of us watching what we eat, and who also adore eggplant parmesan AND pizza, this recipe is a practical godsend!  i made it for a baby shower potluck, and all the ladies appreciated it and gobbled it up. i made it with tomato sauce seasoned with oregano and basil, skim mozzerella and vegetarian pepperoni.  i would give this 5 stars except that it was a bit messy to eat as finger food, with the eggplant mushing in in the middle.  but its worth it and i'll make it again all the same, and so said the other ladies as well.  thanks for a great idea!  cant believe i never thought of it. =)

I've been having a hard time finding things that I really like in the first phase of the South Beach Diet, but these mini eggplant pizzettes are excellent.  Even if I weren't on a diet, I'd love eating them.  They're especially great when my roommate is eating pizza and the smell is just driving me crazy.  With these, I can satisfy that craving without breaking the diet.  Thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful!  A nice nutrious change from regular pizza.  Great recipe!  We liked it so much we had it 3 times in the last 2 weeks.

This was the quickest meal I have ever prepared. Also good for first time eggplant eaters. Try sprinkling a little garlic powder on top when done!

I really like these.  I found a pizza sauce that was lower in carbs than most spaghetti sauces and used that.  This was really fun to make and my whole family enjoyed them.

I think these are good, but my family doesn't get too excited about them. I usually put the cheese on the eggplant first, then the sauce and meat so that it melts together and doesn't slide off.

I usually don't like eggplant, I am trying to eat more veggies.  I left out the ham and used parmesan instead of mozzerella and it was good.

I so wanted this to be good.  But it was just okay.  By the time I got to the last bite I just decided to eat the cheese and canadian bacon.  I think next time I will work on getting a better eggplant.  This one had too many seeds.

This is an ingenuous little recipe for the South Beach Diet. I was getting sick of the same old phase one stuff and this really saved the day!
Like the previous reviewer said -"it's not pizza", but it does satisfy the pizza craving!
 I had never tried eggplant before in my life, but I will have these little babies again!!!

My husband and I both loved this recipe!  It really was just what we needed to quiet that pizza craving.  We opted to use the Canadian bacon, along with some red and green bell peppers and onion that I sauteed in a spray of olive oil prior to placing it on the pizza.  YUM!  

I shared this recipe with other friends doing the SBD.  

Thanks!

Made this at work in a toaster oven for myself and several friends.  The coworkers not on South Beach ate more than the dieters.  Tasted like eggplant parm.  I did however use my "own" sauce to make it tastier.

Good! Exactly as you'd expect. I thought it was delicious and easy and will make again. I added dried basil for a little extra something. Also check out Eggplant Delight on this site.

If you think of it as single slices of eggplant parmesean and not pizza, it's actually rather tasty.  But it's not anywhere near a satisfying low carb substitute for pizza.

Excellent.  I made it with Canadian bacon, and it would definitely work with pepperoni, mushrooms, or any favorite pizza topping.  I would add a bit more sauce next time.  Also, I finished it off with more than five minutes to make the cheese really bubble.  I used a whole eggplant, so we had 8 pieces.  Those who don't like eggplant will enjoy this!

Pretty good - I wish there was a way to make it crunchier to be more like pizza.  I had to eat mine with a fork because it was just too soft and I added peppers, sausage and used monterey jack cheese to be a bit different.

Pretty good as far as taste goes.  I cut the eggplant thin, which was suggested by someone else and they sort of fell apart.  It would have been better if the eggplant could be made crispy some how. . .

I was craving the pizza while I was trying to watch what I ate - and this TOTALLY satisfied the craving!  Add a little red-pepper to the sauce and voila!  It's pizza without the bread! I only gave it four stars b/c let's face it...it's better with bread!

I never had eggplant before and neither did my husband.  We are both on the South Beach Diet and we were suffering the first few days!  I made these on day 3 and it really picked up his spirits. So tasty and healthy too!  Thanks for a great recipe.

So good!  It was a welcome change to my regular salad for lunch on S.B.  However, I gave it 4 stars because it was tricky to make in my office toaster oven.
