I think this is actually spelled "pastasciutta" which, simply put, is a seldom used, general term for pasta. This particular pastasciutta is somewhat of a classic, in a style I grew up with and love. Don't bother to measure ingredients precisely, just season with the garlic butter to taste and add some olive oil too if you like. Save some of the pasta cooking water in case the pasta gets dry once tossed. To add a little color, I also added some finely chopped, fresh parsley. And I would agree, this is even better with a sprinkling of good Parmesan or Romano cheese.

Excellent side dish. I used a batch of homemade noodles instead of the box of spaghetti, and also used one tiny yellow onion and half a large purple onion. Flavor was amazing and I will make this again!

A nice simple pasta dish.  I left out the onions however and used olive oil rather than butter to lighten the calorie and fat content.  It makes a nice light dinner or a wonderful side.

I have made this recipe twice, and plan on making it again very soon.  I love it.  I made it exactly per the recipe the first time, and the second time I doubled the mushrooms only because I loved them so much.  I also put parmesan cheese on each bowl.  I love this, very subtle, but it packs a lot of taste!

Great recipe! I used fresh pasta and that was a great addition. I also used only 8 oz. of pasta but kept the mushrooms, onion and garlic in the original amount. Finally, I cut the onion in half and sliced it instead of chopping it. I agree with other reviewers: some parmesan cheese does wonders for this dish.

Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper!

i think maybe my vegetable to onion ratio was off. but also i think it would be better with bowtie noodles. it had a good flavor but it was very subtle.

I loved this but had no mushrooms - so instead I threw in some frozen pre-cooked shrimp.  It was delish!

Excellent recipe!  To punch up the flavor, I added about 2 tablespoons of sherry and parmesean cheese.  I will be making this many times!

Good recipe, I like to add whatever ingredients I have on hand to a recipe. I added green onions and some leftover green beans. Very tasty, better than I expected.

i dig it but it is a little bit on the bland side. i took the advise about color and onions. this is what i did. i omitted the onions and added some yellow bell pepper for color. then after it was done i chopped some basil in to a chiffonade and since i omitted to onion i added some chives. tasty and colorful

Very good, what is not to love with all those mushrooms.  If you wanted you could lighten it up pretty easily with olive or canola oil etc.  I kind of like the butter though....

I really like this recipe.  It's fast and easy.  I use both packaged sliced mushrooms and Portabella mushrooms.  I also add some extra seasonings while everything is sauteing to give it a little extra flavor. In addition, I have added some spaghetti sauce after I have finished sauteing, heat through and you're ready to go!

A little bland. I would like to see more color in this dish. Perhaps, adding some zucchini or squash.

So good!  Added some italian seasoning to spice it up a bit.  I would also reccomend adding some parmasan cheese to add a bit more flavor.  Overall Excellent!

Kind of bland, but pretty good.  My 3 year old loved it, which is pretty surprising.  I used a yellow onion since the flavor is sweeter, and 1/2 a sliced zucchini (for 2 servings).  It is a LOT of onion, so I'd recommend cutting it back a bit (I used half an onion and minced it)and chopping it finely so it's not so prominent.  A good, qhick, and hearty dinner, and I will make it again!

This is good, but as a side dish, not a main dish. It's a little bland by itself but pairs up nicely with a main dish that has bold flavors. I had it with breaded veal that had a wine/lemon sauce so it worked well. Next time, I might add some peppers in with the onions, garlic, and mushrooms just to give it a little more flavor.

This incredibly easy recipe is delicious.  It is deceptive, because of the short list of ingredients.  Really good.  My toddler liked it, but my seven year old didnt.  I didnt expect him to, because of the dreaded mushrooms and onions.  But everyone else loved it.  I will definately be making this regularly.
