I've made this recipe several times and it's terrific exactly as written.  This weekend I put a different spin on it. The resulting "Vegetable Frittata" was a huge hit. ~

I was looking for an egg dish that had fresh veggies in it.  I found a highly rated Vegetable Frittata on AllRecipes that contained sauteed zucchini, mushroom, onion and bell pepper.  However, this recipe also contained lots of cream cheese, half & half and other rich ingredients.  While I'm SURE it was wonderful, it also had about 40 grams of fat per serving. ~

I was wanting something a little healthier.  I followed this recipe as I always do, only I sauteed the veggies as instructed in the OTHER recipe, and used them in place of the green chiles. ~

I mixed and bake the dish as instructed in this recipe.  Swapping the veggies for the green chiles was my ONLY alteration.  The dish was a HUGE hit -- my father-in-law AND my hubby (who's not a fan of zucchini) went back twice for more. ~

From now on, I'll alternate between the original recipe and my new "veggie frittata" version.  GOOD STUFF!

A Big Hit!  I was skeptical, because I hate cottage cheese & have never heard of using it in an egg casserole recipe.  Needing an egg dish that’s healthier than the type that sits overnight (with bread & tons of cheese, etc), I tried this.  Great taste and texture – just like the ‘overnight’ type I always enjoy.  To make it a bit healthier, half of the eggs I used were just egg-whites, and I added sautéed onions & mushrooms.  The recipe tasted rich, even with the low-fat cheeses.  People raved!

I have made this several times for guests and for pot luck.  Serve with salsa & sousr cream.  Everyone loves it and I am frequently asked for the recipe.  I have changed the cheese to mozzerella, another time to colby/jack.  I always prepare it a day in advance & micro to warm.  Stays moist.

I needed a recipe to use up cottage cheese and came across this. I scaled it to 1/2 the original recipe size and cooked it in a smaller baking dish. I am pretty sure I forgot to put the baking powder in! Surprisingly, the dish still puffed up a little bit without it. I had a couple of slices of leftover cooked bacon so I crumbled it and added to the ingredients. The dish made a satisfying dinner accompaniment. I think I may actually try it next time without the flour, and just beat the egg whites separately to create volume making an even lower carb dish.

I served this as one of the main entrees for Easter brunch. I used a combination of Colby/Jack  and Pepper Jack cheese to give it a little more kick. The only suggestion I have is to really watch the cooking time. After the initial 15 min., mine was done after another 25 min. instead of the 35-40 min. called for. I also sprinkled a little more cheese on and broiled the top just to give it some color. Next time I might try adding roasted red peppers or a few spoonfuls of salsa to give it more color and flavor.

The whole family loved it! I added frozen New Mexico chiles instead of canned (and probably more than 7oz--I like it stong). Definately make again and again...

This is wonderful.  I saute onion and minced garlic with a sprinkle of chipotle powder and add to the other ingredients.  I also line the baking dish with cut corn tortillas and then serve it with chopped tomatoes, onion, cilantro avocado and a sour cream green chili enchilada sauce.

I buy the whole canned mild green chiles.  Then I stuff them with a chunky stick of jack cheese and lay them into a buttered casserole dish.  Pour the egg mixture over the top and cover with shredded cheddar cheese.  Bake till puffed and set in center.  Serve by lifting out a whole stuffed chile for each serving.  Nice presentation and delicious!

Pretty good -not the texture or flavor I was looking for.  I usually make a green chile quiche as part of Christmas brunch, but was looking to cut out some fat and carbs with no crust.  This needs a little tweaking, garlic powder, hot sauce, more cheese.

I have a friend who frequently makes this exact recipe for a breakfast we have with friends every month.  She triples the recipe when she makes it and freezes the other two batches in separate ziploc bags.  She can then thaw one of the bags in the fridge overnight and bake it the next morning.

I love this recipe.  I'll pour it into cupcake tins coated with cooking spray and reduce the cooking time a bit. I'll also often used 1/2 C pepper jack and 1/2 C cheddar - and when I'm really craving spice I'll toss a tablespoon or so of crushed red peppers.  You can really add just about any veggie or cooked meat to it, but I've noticed some veggies might make it a little too moist.

Good stuff! Another low carb winner! Might do better to put first mixture in the blender- to mix flour in better. Then pour in a bowl & add other ingredients. ? I didn't do this, but there were lumps of flour. Came out fine anyway- I found the baking time to be accurate. Serve with yummy Boar's Head bacon & it's a great low carb meal! Great for leftovers too.

I've made this several times and it's always a HUGE hit!  It's very forgiving-- I've used half sour cream and half cottage cheese, at least three different kinds of shredded cheese, added ham, bacon, doubled the chiles, used an even dozen eggs, added jalapeno, etc. etc. and it always turns out phenomenally!

We always heat up the leftovers in the microwave (does NOT turn out rubbery), and my husband even zaps a helping and sticks it on toast for his drive to work.  It's like a gourmet breakfast sandwich, only without the $5 price tag!

This is one of the great recipes of all time in our family and among our friends.  My mother made it often for gatherings; however, her recipe called for 10 drops of tabasco sauce, as well, and Monterey Jack shredded cheese.  The tabasco gives it a tiny zing which is what some other reviewers thought was needed.

I halved the recipe, everything except I still added the full 7 ounce can of green chile peppers.  We like our food spicy, so noting other comments I added red chili pepper flakes, cayenne and paprika.  The flavour was still bland, we could taste the flour and did not like the texture.

I used 12 egg whites and four whole eggs, fat free cottage cheese, and fat free cheddar cheese.  It had a lot of flavor, considering I used so many fat free products.  The serving sizes were larger than I expected them to be.

I had to give this only four stars because I altered it so much to make the fat content more reasonable.  However, I used egg whites only, non fat cottage cheese, and no cheddar cheese, and it was still very very rich, creamy and delicious.  I think this would be too much with the yolks and and fat from cheese, but we loved the light version, mainly because it didn't taste light at all.

This was very fluffy and tasty. I did alter the recipe a bit, I used 1/2 egg whites, and 1/2 egg substitute and low fat cheddar cheese. My guests couldn't tell the difference! I also added some sauteed onions and mushroom and diced thin-sliced deli-style ham. I served it on top of some black beans, topped with sour cream, salsa, and avocado slices. Yuummm!

I cut the recipe in half BUT I left the amount of shredded sharp Cheddar exactly the same. I did add some garlic/onion powder, some fresh ground pepper and little hot sauce. I made no other changes. I was able to bake this the night before, let it cool and slice and rewarm the next morning. No leftovers. We ate it all.

This is an easy recipe that is absolutely delicious.  It's also a great base from which to add other ingredients, as other reviewers have stated.  Best of all, you don't have to make it the night before.

Easy and delicious!  I did it according to the recipe with the exception of the cooking time - which was shorter than written by about 10 min.

Wow, this frittata recipe is a winner!  Not only is it PERFECT as written, but it can easily be tweaked with some different spices and cheeses.  I used some asiago (my fav cheese) along with the cheddar, and I garnished the top with slices of fresh tomatoes and chopped basil from my garden.  It was like a picture in a magazine and scrumptious to boot.  Thanks for posting, Melanie!

I used olive oil instead of butter and gluten-free flour from Domata. I also used 1 cup cottage cheese and 1 cup greek yogurt. Wow!

I've made this recipe quite a few times and its quite good. You can add whatever you please to change the outcome which is a nice bonus. I always add extra grated cheddar to the top plus a good sprinkle of sesame seeds over the cheddar for a nice crunchy crust. I don't usually make it for breakfast though, its become one of my fast & easy dinners when I'm pressed for time.   Just add a bowl of salad & and you're good to go!

Great recipe! I brought this dish to an office potluck and it was very well received. I added an additional 4 oz. can of chilies, a little extra cheddar and half a teaspoon of garlic powder, and it was delicious.

Really fast to assemble, only cooking time took away from the quickness rating.  To make it more kid friendly, you could leave out the green chiles, and maybe add sausage.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Currently my new favorite frittata! I was looking for foods with high protein, and with eggs and adding the cottage cheese, it makes it a great way to get protein! The only thing I added was chopped onions!

This was easy, tasted great and was a nice change from just plain eggs.  The only change I made was substituting "Egg Beaters" for the eggs.  The whole family liked this.

Hmm. I made this because I was trying to use up some cottage cheese in my fridge. It definitely had a different texture from the frittatas I am used to making- not bad, just different. I'm giving it three stars because I think it's a little bland as is. Next time I would add more veggies and definitely more chiles- I didn't feel like I could really taste them.

This was quick and simple to make; however I thought it was rather bland.  If defintely tasted better the second day.  The next time, I would probably used hot green chili's, maybe even two cans and add some crumbled bacon or sausage.  I will make again though.

A little bland.  Thank goodness for the green chiles, or it wouldn't have any flavor at all.  Texture is good.  Maybe this is one to "doctor".

I probably should rename my version Spinach Frittata. I followed the recipe exactly, except substituted a box of well drained chopped spinach for the green chiles and added half a sauteed onion. Worked great. Served it with sour cream and salsa. Next time when I have green chiles around I'll try it that way.

This was a very nice dish.  I only had a 4 oz can of green chiles, next time I will make sure I have 7oz.  I also left out the butter and there was really no need for it.  Served with turkey sausage and apple chips.

I have made this for years, and love it.  The difference in my recipe is that I add one stick of melted butter, 1lb co-jack cheese,and two cans diced green chilis.  Ate it for breakfast today topped off with my canned salsa.

My go-to for an easy and delicious breakfast, lunch or dinner!  I actually lost my recipe that is similar to this one -- thank goodness it was here for my brunch today.  The recipe as it stands is great.  My changes are for the preferences of my family only -- another can of chiles and another cup of cheese.

This is definitely not a frittata. Frittatas are cooked on top of the stove and then put in the oven to finish off, more like an omlette. This is more like a crustless quiche. Still good, however. I think it can be improved by adding some sausage or bacon. Maybe ham or even ground beef that has been drained of all fat. It's an easy recipe to tweak to what you have on hand and like.

Crowd pleaser!! I did it in an 11 inch spring form pan, which really worked well. The call for cottage cheese struck me as odd, but it turned out perfectly.

My husband told me he wanted me to make him some beans and eggs- a pretty common mexican breakfast and one of his favorites.  I felt like mixing it up a little so I made this casserole and some homemade refried beans.  I served some nice warm corn tortillas on the side and it was a great breakfast!  My husband loved it. The green chiles added a lot of flavor.  As much as I liked this casserole, eating it with beans made it even better!  Refried beans are easy. Give it a try!

I added turkey sausage, a can of diced potatoes and topped it with cilantro and sour cream for a light dinner last night.

I used fat free cheddar and cottage cheese and it turned out great.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, the only difference is that I used fresh rather than canned green chilies.  (And I halved it, because it's just my husband and I at home!)  It turned out beautifully!  I was skeptical about using cottage cheese in a frittata, but it worked out well.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Amazing. Mind you, I had to make some changes due to a lack of ingredients and baby brain from having a 5 month old. It came out incredibly. 

I added two chopped roma tomatoes, pepper, garlic powder, and substituted half the cottage cheese for cream cheese. Also, I forgot to lower the temperature of the oven but pulled it out 15 minutes early. It was beautifully browned and delicious. Will be making this again!

made 1/2 batch with whole can of chili's (4 oz) - Fritz said a little blah - but ok - try using green or red chili powder to spice it up for him.  Made corn muffins with bacon, cheese and chives in them - and honey butter to go with it.  OK but would be better warmer.

It is somewhat bland and as others have said, you can hardly taste the chiles. I may try this again as a base, but I will probably just look for a different frittata recipe. O well.

Very very good; better than other egg casseroles I've done that contain hashbrowns.  I added mushrooms, chopped ham, and a little extra kick with extra dried green chiles and some chipotle powder.  Baked in a glass pan and after lowering the temp, it took about 50+ minutes (instead of 35-40 as shown).  Outstanding - a big thumbs up.

I made this last night - I left out the butter to cut some fat and added 2 diced tomatoes and some ground pepper. (and maybe was a big generous with the cheddar cheese...)  This turned out moist and delicious! I have passed on the recipe to a couple of coworkers who followed their sniffer to my desk after I just warmed some up and was munching away happily At my desk.  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe - Melanie! I will keep making this and passing it along to friends and family!
*UPDATE* Have been making a more "filling" version for my husband - I buy beef rouladen, cut into thin strips, and stir fry it with a diced onion, I let that cool a bit and then add it to the egg mixture. I microwave a couple of potatoes and peel those, and add that to the casserole dish before I sprinkle cheese on top. He happily devours it, although he hates the idea of cottage cheese, and is not a big egg-fan.
Thanks Again!

Used all ingredients listed above, plus 1c of chopped broccoli and 1c of chopped onion.  Was *very* bland - we had to douse it in hot sauce to get through it. Next time I'll add a good amount of garlic salt and probably chili powder and cumin.

Loved this.  Surprised my husband who normally cooks breakfast but decided to sleep in.  I used egg beaters but didn't get all crazy healthy when I added a few slices of cooked bacon chopped up!  Sauteed some onion and garlic as well and added the hot sauce that another reviewed suggested.  This will be in our regular recipe rotation.  Leftovers still good heated in the microwave.

this was very tasty.  i sauteed a few onions, some garlic, and some mushrooms to throw in plus put a few cherry tomatoes chopped up per another reviewer.  i cut the 400 degree time in half and then only baked at 325 degrees for 25 mins.  actually it could have come out of the oven a few mins. earlier.  have to be careful of that. my husband has cardiac issues and we have to watch our diet so i used egg beaters and olive oil in lieu of the melted butter.  delicious.

I made this yesterday and loved it.  It came out perfect.  I should not have rated this a 5 because I only made half the recipe and  I added some diced onion and a whole fresh tomato.  It was just that good.  Make this, you will not be sorry.

Made for Christmas morning, fast and easy, was bland and the texture a little moist.  I added sauted onions, mushrooms and julienned fresh spinach.  Still desperately needed the hot salsa and sour cream that I served with it.  Next time I'll use hot peppers.

I had a similar recipe many years ago and lost track of it.  I wanted to bake the frittata in a 7 x 11 pan so only used 8 eggs and left everything else the same.  Came out great and we loved it.  With my old recipe I found that it was so versatile, I could put pepperoni on top, or asparagus spears or whatever you have on hand.  Really good and easy recipe.

Really liked this recipe. I have never made a frittata before and was excited because I love breakfast foods. Added some ham and onions to the batter before baking. Turned out great! Will definitely be making again & playing around with various ingredients.

I made this dish for a breakfast and everyone loved it, in fact my cousin took the recipe home with her.  The only change I made, being from Texas, I used chopped jalapenos instead of green chilies.  I love that it doesn't have bread in it.

I love this recipe.  It is quick and easy and it is so nice to have a breakfast casserole with no bread or meat in it for a change.  My husband, who does not like any kind of casserole, actually ate it!  This has become our Christmas breakfast so thank you for posting and adding to our traditions.
I will experiment with some of the suggestions from others, just for fun, but love the original.

I made this last night for dinner and it was GREAT!! What was nice about this recipe was that I had everything handy for the recipe and didn;t have to go shopping or ingredients.  My husband said that it was too bad we didn't have more..I scaled it down for four.  We had sour cream and salsa with it..

I made this frittata  for a crowd and it was a big hit.
I made a couple of changes to the recipe, however.  I used 2- 7 oz cans of diced green chiles, 1 diced and sweated onion(2 cups), a diced red bell pepper,  and 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.
This is a great recipe.

Love this recipe with one addition, breakfast sausage, one to one and a half pounds of any cooked sausage does the trick. I've been making it this way for about 4 years for Christmas morning, fathers day, Easter, etc. I've made it the night before a few times and just microwave each slice for about a minute and it's wonderful, especially with extra hot sauce. originally I thought the cottage cheese addition sounded weird, but it makes the dish perfectly creamy. I love it!

My family enjoyed this dish although I added a few my own ingredients. I followed the basic recipe and also added into the mixture a dallop sour cream, dried parsley, garlic salt, onion powder and  chopped fresh spinach. I would have liked to add fresh onion but i was out so i opted for the onion powder i had onhand. I also mixed both pepper jack and cheddar. I sprayed the bottom of the dish with pam spray and spread freshly cooked and crumbled crispy bacon then poured the egg mixture over the bacon. I baked as directed but took out of oven about 10 min early as i did not want it to dry out.  Served w sour cream and avacado wedges. Yummy :)

Made this for Christmas morning.  Topped it with salsa, avocado and sour cream.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I'll add sausage to mix things up.

Needed something for a brunch and thought this would work in cupcake pans for easy single servings.  It was a hit!
Also stirred in 5 oz fully cooked sausage crumbles.  
Grease the cupcake pans (makes about 20), fill 3/4 full, bake at 400 for 10 min and 325 for 15-18 min.  Top with fresh cut chives.

Made this for a brunch this morning, and came home with an empty pan!  Only change I made was to increase the amount of chopped green chiles, and added white pepper. Delicious!

Just made this for dinner. Cut recipe in half & used to 9x9 pan. I put a layer of cubed ham & sauteed onion on bottom of pan then poured egg mixture over the top.  Much easier than a quiche. Loved it.

I had never tasted a frittata before and decided I would give this recipe a shot. It was really yummy, especially with salsa and sour cream. Light in calories too considering how filling it is!

Disappointed!  I thought it would have a little fire, but in truth, I could not taste the chili peppers.  Other than that it was OK.  Next time I will add other veggies  and some hot sauce and save my chili peppers for a dish that allows me to taste them!  I did serve them with salsa and sour cream to add some oomph!

Looking for an egg recipe we can have for dinner, so I tried this one, and it was surprizingly good! I think it needed more chiles, cheese and some black pepper but other than that, a nice dish. I did have some flour lumps when mixing with the eggs, but just continued to stir until most broke down. Will make again...maybe with a different cheese and veggie.

Very yummy and so easy to make.  I used a can of tomatoes and chiles, which tasted great.  I think this would be a great base recipe if you wanted to include other ingredients as well.  I love that it just needs to be baked, rather than fried first.

absolutely love it. Make it every week. I make varieties of it though. Like the last time we had it I added mushrooms. Once before I added roasted veggies. The kids beg me for it. As a matter of fact we're having it for breakfast tomorrow morning. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe. Love it. !!!!

This was a nice change of pace. I used oat flour, and roasted Hatch green chiles rather than canned. I also omitted the butter. The green chile flavor wasn't strong enough for us, even though we used extra, so next time I'll top it with green chile (sauce). This would also be good with pepper-jack cheese and olives. Nice flavor, not too heavy, and very easy to make--a definite keeper!

I have never made frittata and I don't even know if I have eaten it but this recipe is really good!!!  I made it as written the first time and it was great!!! The second time I used diced tomatoes, green peppers, zucchini and mushrooms.  I used self rising flour and omitted the melted butter.  It was just as good as the original. Great recipe and easy to substitute whatever you have on hand! I make enough for five servings and pack them in individual serving containers and take to work for breakfast every morning.  Thanks for posting!!!!

Very good, simple recipe. I am always looking for a great brunch dish...that it incorporates chiles is a bonus. I would not call it a fritatta, though, it is more quiche-like, or strata-like in nature...minus the crust or bread, of course. Truly a great recipe. Thanks!

This recipe is a great starting platform for substitutions and additions!  I substituted 3 chipotle chiles in adobo in place of the green chiles and reduced the butter by half.  I was concerned about the cottage cheese buy it turned out great.  My family really enjoyed it.

We enjoyed this frittata. It was perfect for a Sunday morning breakfast. I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8"x 8" pan.  I think next time I would up the amount of chile, we like more spice. It was delicious!

I put these ingredients together for a frittata for one.  I used two eggs, 1/4 cup cottage cheese, 1/4 cup cheddar cheese, 1/8 cup flour, dash of baking powder and salt, and about 2 tablespoons of green chiles. I buttered a small frying pan and kept it over medium heat until it was set on the bottom, then put it under the broiler until it started browning - maybe 5 minutes or less. Served it with salsa and avocado slices. Yum! Maybe I'll make it again and post it as an original recipe...

I have made this recipe twice. The first time exactly as written and the second time substituted bacon for chili’s   Always fluffy and delicious. It’s great the next day heated up in the microwave as well. I cut the recipe in half because it’s just hubby and me and didn’t have to cook it as long as it states.

I began frying up some thinly sliced yukon gold potatoes and onions, to use up some produce before we went away. Then I found this recipe, and followed it, but added the egg mixture to the potato/onion mix. 

I think the flour was not needed. The fritata came out very dry. Perhaps the time could be reduced.

It was disappointing since the ingredients seemed like the result would be rich and delicious.

I had to 1/2 the recipe, but added 1 full can of diced chilies to give the frittata more flavor, and also added finely chopped green onion tops, and some onion, red pepper flakes. This is too much for my small 6c. muffin tin. ..probably could have made 2 more.

This recipe tastes great, and I will definitely be making it again, but it still leaves something to be desired in regard to flavor. My husband and I both had this fresh from the oven, and we each said cayenne pepper would complement this recipe well. So we went ahead and sprinkled some on our respective pieces and thought it was a good addition. We also tried red pepper flakes, and while we liked this as well, we both felt it would taste better if it was added during the mixing stage of the recipe and could be cooked along with the other ingredients. We also plan to try adding diced onions to the next batch, since we like that flavor and they should add a nice crunch.

This is my go-to recipe from brunches. Sometimes I leave out the green chilies and put in broccoli, sweet bell pepper, or whatever veggies that I have on hand.

I too added sautéd diced onions, minced garlic, and lined the bottom of the baking pan with corn tortillas (as another user suggested) to the recipe for a little extra flavor. It was excellent, easy to make, and my vegetarian daughter loved it!

So easy and moist. I serve this over toasted bagels when I have big groups. They always love it. I even add extra veggies in it like zucchini or squash or peppers.

My husband loved this recipe!! So great for on the go! Cooked a 9x13 pan and had left overs for weeks, tastes just as good days later!!  I added my husbands favorite sausage, I can’t wait to start experimenting with different meats. Also instead of the diced green chile peppers I used fresh green chile from the can, tasted wonderful!

Great to eat on the run; I made a batch and took it to work, and I microwave it for breakfast.  The only thing I would do differently next time is I would use hotter Chile peppers; I used the mild ones this time around.

This was yummy and easy to put together.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Cooked for only 35 minutes after turning the oven down to 325 and it was definitely done - a little dry around the edges.  Probably could have cooked only 25 - 30 minutes at 325 and would have been perfect.

Very nice recipe.  I made it for dinner last night with some fruit on the side.  cottage cheese is a great idea.  The other filling combinations are endless.  I did peppers, onion, garlic and bacon.  I'm thinkg about salsa, or chorizo....

Very good!  The only thing I would do is cut-down the cooking time to 25 minutes vs. the 35-40.  I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed others review and the second time, I forgot to - it turned out a little "too" brown.

Delicious with great texture, fluffy and moist.  I used fresh (not canned) green peppers and Poblano peppers and roasted them over an open flame.  It was great and everybody loved it.

This was good.  I made half a batch since it was just a few of us.  The only change i made was to use the whole can of chiles instead of half that is called for.  I really enjoyed the flavor the whole can gave, so if i were to make the full recipe i would use 2 cans of green chiles.

I liked the fact that this didn't have to sit overnight. It's a great alternative to an overnight egg bake. However, I thought it was a little bland. If I make this again, I would add some finely diced ham or maybe a little salsa to the mix.

Yum!  I have never put cottage cheese in a frittata but it was delishious.  I have made it twice now and most recently I made it for a brunch shower I was hosting.  I also added diced (pre-cooked) ham and served it cold cut up in little squares.  It was great!

This was a great recipe.I made it this father's day and everyone loved it. Even my six kids came back for seconds. The only thing I changed was I added a little more green chiles. but all in all it was wonderful just the way it was. I will be making it again very soon.

After making this recipe, I know I'll be making frittatas a lot more often.  It was easy to prepare, much easier than an omelette, and really tasty and filling.  It came out perfect just the way the recipe is written.  I did beat the eggs slightly before adding the dry ingredients, and I used a wire whisk to make sure the flour, etc., got mixed in thoroughly.   The only thing I might do differently next time is to add some chopped onions.  But it's great just as is!

Brought this to a Cinco de Mayo celebration at work and everyone loved it! I added browned breakfast sausage just to give it more substance and at the suggestion of another reviewer I added some cheese to the top and broiled it to melt it. One word to the wise - before you make this the night before make sure that the 9x13 pan fits in your microwave to reheat the next day! I thought I had a big microwave, but I guess I was wrong! :0) Happy cooking!!!

Because there are just the two of us, I cut the recipe in half, but I followed the lisited directions.  It was good, but I must have been expecting something different but don't know what.  Next time I think I will add a touch of salsa on top to kick it up a little.  Yes, I will make it again and most likely serve it to company as a step up from plain scrambled eggs.

This was good.  I like reicpes that are not too complicated but turn out successful.  This is one of them.  Very tasty and can be served with different sides like salsa, asparagus, biscuits, whatever.

This is a giant omelet, but it's not that bad... I guess I was expecting a quiche consistency and more flavor. Very edible for a low key, no fuss meal.

This was so easy and actually really tasty for so few ingredients. The only changed I used was making sure I had all non-fat/low-fat ingredients and I added jalepenos.  I still feel it could use a little zip to make up for using so many low fat items that I might play around with it and add some garlic or onions next time.  All over a really easy, great recipe!

I have found this one pleases the "picky" or non-adventurous eaters.  Easy to make.
