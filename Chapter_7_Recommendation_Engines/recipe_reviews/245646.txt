5Stars for ease. Caramel can scorch or burn easily this recipe is forgiving.

Added about 1/5 cup of water and 1/8 cup more of pecans, served on top of a pumpkin cheesecake, it was perfect. On its own it's a bit salty, but it is perfect served on top of a sweet dessert, especially if you like the sweet/salty combination.

Put it over a warmed brownie topped w/vanilla ice cream.  Turned hard on the ice cream quickly.  Will have to heat it up and thin it out for next time.  Still, very, very yummy!!

It was super easy to make and was almost perfect; except that it was way too salty. I sensed that a teaspoon of salt was too much and so used less but it was still way salty. Served on cheesecake, it was ok, but i would definitely cut the salt.

This was way too salty!!!  We added over a cup of extra sugar to compensate. 
Will make again, without the salt completely.  Then add a dash at a time.

This was really easy and came out beautifully! One thing i would do differently is use less salt. It came out more like a salted caramel sauce. I happen to love salted caramel, but it was a bit too much.
