This is okay for a veggie dip.  I was a bit leary bc it's only mayo--I'm not a big fan of mayo.  But it's actually not bad.  Bf thought it was "weird" but ate half of it, so it passes.  I might use 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo to see if I like it better that way.  Thanks!

I thought the turmeric and horseradish made this dip especially good for cauliflower.  A yummy cracker & chip dip, too!

Very simple & Good.  Had to make a 2nd batch before the event even began!!  Although I doubled the amount of horseradish for a little bit more kick.  Very good flavor!  Will make again.

Wonderful flavor! I like it the way it is, but I will try it with a little extra sugar. It definitely helps me enjoy my raw vegetables. Try it on fish also. I used it on top of some salmon and it was GREAT! Thanks for a keeper!

This dip is awesome! Next time I make it I think I will add more Horseradish sauce because I prefer a little more kick but it is great even just as it is.

Not so yummy!  Tasted like yellow mayo to me.  OK, but nothing special.

This has become our standard dip recipe. We make double the amount and keep it on hand in the refrigerator for whenever anyone wants raw veggies and dip. The only change is that we leave out the horseradish (don't like it) and use balsamic vinegar instead of white.

Instead of mayo you could whirl cottage cheese in a blender and use that.  I've done it before and it's good.  Maybe add a little mayo for that flavor.

This was not an ingredient combo that sounded good. However, they all combine to make a very yummy dip! I made this for a family dinner and it was a hit!

This is now my favorite dip! I used organic mayonnaise and I use organic raw sugar rather than white refined, in most all my recipes. I like  dipping sweet peppers, orange, yellow, red and green depends on what the main dish is going to be.
