I decided to forego the egg dip, instead making this on my panini grill. Aside from that small change I still got the crispy effect..

2.28.16  This sandwich has a lot going on, but the bacon, brown mustard, and cranberry sauce were good additions.  Couldn't really taste the nutmeg, so if you're looking for that flavor, I'd recommend adding more than a pinch.  My bread slices were huge, so it ended up being monster size...we split it for lunch today.

My family enjoyed it very much but I didn't.  Four stars because four out of five in this house liked it.

It was OK but think cooking french toast in butter would be better.

I made big changes. I basically used this as a base flavor profile.  I used a flour tortilla in place of bread.  My stomach just can't handle yeast breads. Instead of cranberry sauce, I used lemon juice and a bit of zest to tart it up in a couple tspns  of mayo. I'm not sure I'd call it a Cristo because of all these changes, but it was fantastic!

I had to make a few changes, mainly because of availability, I used only 1 slice of bacon because our local bacon is sliced a quarter of an inch thick, I used coconut oil because it makes everything taste better, I also used strawberry jam instead of cranberry sauce, smoked chicken. gouda cheese and dijon mustard. This sandwich which sold for 1000 rouble ($15) was very popular in my restaurant for the first few days while on the "specials" menu, and is now on the standard menu.

I made several variations of this recipe... sometimes I use all three meats or I will substitute Canadian Bacon for regular... I have use a variety of different fruit preserves in place of the cranberry sauce and even mixed up the cheeses (using American, Swiss, Pepper Jack, Cheddar, and even Provolone) and have found that I can really pick a favorite combination.... One might wonder "Why" so many different variation?... truth is for me, it is "variety in food is the spice of life".
