I have made this recipe many times.  I am not a cheese fan, so I eliminate the cheese and I add dill to it.  GREAT quick and easy salad to have for a quick bite or to take to carry in's

Oh my, so good and easy!  My husband loved this and proclaimed it to be his favorite pasta salad. 
I ran out of ranch dressing (I doubled the pasta) and mixed miracle whip, white vinegar and sugar as a dressing stretch. Used pickle relish as a sub for the cut up pickles and no celery.
Will make again with celery and maybe red onion.
Thanks Amanda

Fantastic salad!! Didn't have any celery so chopped up a med. red bell pepper for crunch, added sliced black olives & served it on a bed of Romaine lettuce. So good there were no leftovers. I will make this again
soon!!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I always keep on open mind to trying a new "twist" on various recipes and often in delighted with the results, but I did not really care for this - maybe the sweetness and the ranch blend just wasn't appealing to me....and others took it the same way, I took it to a family gathering a came home with a bowl full.

This seemed really dry with only 1/4 cup of dressing, so doubled that, still seemed dry, so also added 1/4 cup mayo. It was okay, but rather bland for my taste.

Granted, I was already hungry, but when I finished preparing this salad, I ate about ten spoonfuls. It was so delicious, I couldn't help myself. Please note that if you have a tendency to add slightly more peas or pasta, you will need more ranch dressing. 1/4 cup of the dressing doesn't go very far; be prepared to add more, if necessary.

This was really delicious. I made it according to the recipe. Make sure to use a good ranch dressing (Hidden Valley is our favorite!).  My family loved it.

Really liked this recipe as a basic starter.  I thought it was a little bland, so added some rosemary and thyme.  Perked it right up.

This was a nice pasta salad with a veggie thrown in.  Especially since I had to tweak it a bit for what I had on hand.  Parmesan dressing instead of ranch, apple cider vinegar, dehyd. onions, and pickle relish.  After all that, it still ended up tasty!  I agree though that 1/4C dressing is really not enough.  I had to add more to make it moist enough.  Probably used a little more of the peas too.  And sprinkled in some dried oregano for a little extra flavor.  All in all, a tasty salad for a warm summer's day.

I thought this was very good. I should have made more as I really didn't think about the quantity. I felt the dressing was very flavorful, maybe I could have made a little more but overall, I thought everything was very good.

Sigh - Lucky for me this is a very forgiving recipe. Having said that, if you happen to find out at the last minute that you don't have any ranch dressing, lite blue cheese works really well. And I doubled the sauce since it seemed to dry to me, but thanks so much for the post. We'll do this again and again!

This is so good I made it twice in one week.  Love the dressing, it's perfect!  I left out the sweet pickle, as we don't like ours too sweet.  I added some chopped red bell pepper that I had on hand for additional flavor and color.  I also used canned peas that I had refrigerated a couple of hours before hand so they'd stay firm.  We prefer canned peas over frozen.  This is staying in the rotation!

Yum-my! Had to make a few adjustments, though. No onions, because I can't eat them, used Rice Vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar, and used canned peas because that's what I was trying to use up. I used mayo because I don't like Ranch dressing and also doubled the dressing after reading other reviews. This is a complete meal: protein, starch, vegetables. It's filling but light: a definite keeper!
