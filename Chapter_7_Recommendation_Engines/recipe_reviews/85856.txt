AWESOME!  Great flavor, good kick, not too much anything and a really good different way to make plain ol' rice.  Works well with brown rice too--just up the liquids a bit and cook longer!

Really good!  Nice favor - a little kick, but not too much.  It reminded me of a Moroccan dish.  Based on what other reviewers said, I cut down the cumin to 1 tsp. and used equal parts oj and broth (1 cup each).  I did need to cook it longer than the stated 20 minutes as the rice was still crunchy, even after the liquid was absorbed.  Everyone who ate this dish really liked it.  I'll make again.

Added a little more cayenne for the kick and 1/4 cup cilantro more, it just looked better. Absolutely wonderful. Great with  ginger/teriyaki glazed salmon.

Delicious!! I used pulpy orange juice which was great. Fabulous combination of flavors! I have a gas stove so I needed to add a bit more broth. Will certainly make this again!

Absolutely loved this fresh tasting rice.  Cilantro lovers, you will really like this one!  Per previous reviewers suggestion I added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup orange juice.  The flavors were perfect.  The cayene makes it.   Served with Chicken Kabobs Mexicana, a a great summer entertaining combo.  Many thanks!

Very flavorful and delicious.  Even though I love cumin I did cut it back to 1 tsp, which I found to be plenty.  Otherwise followed exactly and was very happy.  Aromatic and yummy.  I'll be making this again.  My husband loved it too.  Thanks for a new spin on a rice dish!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Easy to prepare.  Went great with Mandarin Orange Chicken.  Gave a 4-star due to the fact we cooked it for the amount of time stated and it was slightly crunchy.  Will increase cooking time next time around, but we will definitely be saving the recipe to make again.

This was very good.  I like cumin, but 2 tsp seemed like a lot so I cut it down to one, and I'm glad I did.  I also cut down a bit on the orange juice.  I served it with Fig and Lemon Chicken from this site, and the two dishes went together very nicely.  I will definately make this again.

The orange juice and cilantro add some zip to the rice.  Nice flavour.

This is a really tasty variation for a rice side dish.  Because I wanted a milder flavor, I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1 cup chicken stock and 1 cup orange juice.  I also used 1 tsp cumin instead of two.  I've made this with parsley when that's what I have on hand.  The flavor is milder, but still good.  I put everything in my rice cooker, and it turns out great.

We didn't have much luck with this recipe; our rice was undercooked and crunchy. If we try again, I'd cover it while cooking or cook at a higher temperature.

This recipes was tasty. However I had to cut down on the amount since I was only making for two people.  I might have put too much cumin but I also think next time I need to omit the cayenne pepper since I don't like too much spiciness. I could taste the orange flavor in the rice. was nice. I made this rice with, "Marinated Tuna Steaks," from this website.

I made a huge dinner, with chicken, boneless pork chops and multiple sides. Everyone's favorite dish? The orange-cilantro chicken, the afterthought. :)  I picked it because the chicken had orange juice in the sauce and I wanted the side to complimnt it. It was my personal favorite, as well.   I'm making it again tonight, to go with another chicken meal.

This was SO good even my kids gobbled it up! One slight modification was that I used pineapple juice instead of orange and added pineapple tidbits. I served it with salmon marinated in the same juice/spice combination.

POSSIBLE WITH MINUTE RICE!  I too cut back on the cumin to a tsp and didn't have any onions handy.  However, you boil everything together except the cilantro, throw in the minute rice, let it do its thing, and then toss with cilantro.  AMAZING!

Although my family didn't care for this (they said it tasted weird), I thought the blend of flavors was excellent.  I made this for dinner along with 2 other recipes from this site, the caramalized chicken and bacon and cheddar stuffed mushrooms.

I added extra orange juice at the end and an extra 10-15 minutes cooking time and it was still a little crunchy.  I didn't mind the al dente but the rest of the family didn't care for it.  I made it with Smoky Mountain chicken.

Made just as recipe showed, with the exception that we added just a little more cayenne.  Wonderful flavors and a perfect dish for company.  This will be a new favorite in our household - thanks for sharing it!

Loved this.  Made it mostly as written, but didn't brown the rice (lacked both time and patience) and used 1 cup of orange juice and 1 cup of stock, because my husband tends not to like things too sweet.  I kept all of the spice proportions the same; even though it seems like 2 tsps of cumin would be overwhelming, you need that much to cut through the sweetness of the OJ.  Like others, my rice could have used another minute or two, but I was being pretty casual about timing so that could have been my fault.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good and the chicken broth and orange juice was just enough to keep the rice moist. Cayenne pepper is definitely needed

I thought this was delicious, but the kids hated it! They all thought it was "too spicy" or had a "funny taste"...so hence the 3 stars. I don't think it was spicy, but had an exotic flavor...mmm...

This side dish was made exactly to specification, except we inserted the dash of ginger that so many recommended in their comments. Unfortunately, I still found the dish slightly bland, and the consistency was horribly sticky and the rice clumped together something terrible. I served it with Bev's Orange Chicken (as the Main Course), but even the gravy from the main dish did little to help separate the clinging pieces of rice. *Note: My daughter made this in her rice cooker, which very rarely fails in fully cooking such a rice dish.

Excellent. Everyone loved this! I added orange zest for more orange flavor and used long grain rice so I had to cook it longer.

Good rice!  I used water instead of chicken broth, and vegetable oil instead of butter, and it turned out good!  Only weird thing, the bottom of the rice burned... maybe I had the heat on too high.  Still tasted good, even with a few burned bits :-)  Served with tilapia.

This makes a nice side dish for when you're in the mood for something different.  I decreased the amount of OJ to one cup and increased the broth to one cup.  It was just sweet enough without being overly sweet.

I followed other people's suggestions, using 1/2 OJ, 1/2 broth.  I still found the orange flavor overpowering.  It was edible the first time, but the leftovers seemed to taste even worse.

I love my rice and this recipe hit the spot!  Orange juice with rice?  Who would have thought?  The spices listed for this recipe have the perfect amount.  Just make the cayenne pepper mandatory rather than being an option.

Fantastic! I used brown rice, so it took longer to cook than I realized. I went for a theme and paired the rice with Grilled Orange Flank Steak. Yum!

This is fabulous! The mix of flavors makes this rice side truly unique.  My rice-loving kids didn't like it but the three adults loved it!  Served with Oven Stuffer Roaster and Roasted Broccoli.

This was ok.  The flavor of the cumin, I thought was very strong (and I like cumin).  Next time, maybe I will make with black beans for a kind of island flair...

this tasted so light and wonderful.  It is great paired with a seafood entree.  The only modifications I made were to put about 2 tsp. of the grated orange rind in it for a bit more orange flavor.  That worked real well.  I used basmati rice also to make this.  This is a keeper recipe and so easy to prepare.

Delicious and different.  The only changes I would make are a little less orange juice, and a little more chicken stock.  The orange flavour was a little over-powering.

This recipe was delicious - I didn't have any chicken broth so I just used water and it still came out lovely. I also used the leftovers cold in lettuce-leaf wraps with a little chicken and it was awesome!

I thought this was a great way to add flavor to plain rice.  I served it with a tandoori style fish recipe I was trying and it really brightened with the deeper flavors of the fish.  Turns out we didn't love the fish, but the rice is a keeper for sure.

This was a really good pilaf type dish.  I used wild rice so it needed to cook a lot longer (I cooked the rice for 20 minutes w water before adding it to the dish to cook for the remaining time).  The orange comes through but isn't overpowering, and the cilantro was a nice contrast.  I'll make this again.  It could easily be turned into a main dish by adding more protein, like chicken or tofu.

We loved this rice!! Made it with sweet chili cilantro chicken. They went really well together. We had to keep adding water (maybe 3/4 cup or more), and it probably took 20 min longer. Maybe because of the gas stove. Will definitely be making this again (:

Made this for the first time tonight & it was a hit all around. My 12-year old daughter even loved it & went back for more! Because I live at high altitude and saw other comments about needing more liquid, I increased the chicken broth to 1 1/4 cup and the orange juice to about 1 3/4 cup for a total of 3 cups liquid. This worked well for me and kept the rice from being crunchy.  I also only had basmati rice on hand, so that's what I used.  I used the full 2 tsp. of cumin and the cayenne pepper, plus all other listed spices. I served it w/ seasoned pork tenderloin and a big green salad.

This rice dish was delicious and flavorful - looking forward to making it again soon! :)

This rice was good but a little too much with the cumin. If your not a big fan of cumin I suggest don't add so much or don't add it at all, but over all it was delish & loved the orange taste w/cilantro.

Fantastic! My husband and I both loved it. We have cilantro in the backyard and this gives us one more reason to use it. Instead of cayenne I added some chili peppers and the subtle heat was perfect. We will be making this again and again!

This was way to tangy. I followed the recipe without making adjustments. I think it would probably taste better with more Chicken Stock and less OJ. Maybe even some orange zest instead of orange juice as it the juice really just makes the rice take on the profiles of OJ but not much of the flavor. I personally would prefer the flavor without the Sweetness or Tang, when it comes to eating rice

this was just ok. i felt like something went wrong - the orange juice flavor was pretty strong and a bit over powering. i think my guest were being nice by saying it was 'really' good but it did taste better the next day as reheated leftovers.

This is a surprisingly easy and delicious dish. We used homemade orange juice, which doesn't get it a bright orange, but still a pleasing color.

I left out the cumin (not a fan) and added just a pinch of cayanne pepper. I read the reviews and did half broth and half juice as well. I also added the juice of 1/2 a lime when I took it off the heat, and it was wonderful! Very interesting flavor combinations.

For as fun and tasty as this recipe sounds and looks, its not really all that tasty. I don't think the orange juice and the seasonings went well together. I did enjoy cooking this recipe, i was very excited as well as apprehensive about the orange juice, but im glad i tried it.

This was pretty good. I love cilantro so anything that I can add that to in my book is great. I did also have to cook it about 8 minutes longer as the rice was still hard and I had to add extra orange juice. Definitely tasty!

This was fine. The saving grace was that I love cilantro.

Like other readers said, it needs to cook longer than the recipe states otherwise it is crunchy.  Also would recommend cutting back on the cumin a bit and doing 1/2 and 1/2 broth and orange juice. Otherwise, tasty and interesting side dish.

The orange juice flavor was overwhelming! It was really tart and I had to steal some of my sons mandarin oranges for a little sweetness. I will definitely not try this again...and I am an excellent cook. Thank God this recipe is inexpensive.

This one really didn't work out for us. It was OK - nothing special. Just tasted like rice and orange juice. Probably will never make it again.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I used 50/50 proportion of chicken broth and orange juice, and half the cumin. I also left out the onion powder and garlic powder, and threw in some chopped garlic instead. Delicious! My husband and I both loved it. We served it with the glazed salmon recipe found on this site, and some steamed broccoli. The cayenne gives it quite a kick, if you don't like spicy food use it very sparingly.

I was so disappointed with this! I finally got the time to prepare it tonight, and the only plus about it was that it was quick! I like the taste of orange juice, but 1 and 1/2 cups was just waaaay too much! And I browned the rice and simmered for 20 minutes (as the recipe states) and it was still crunchy and undercooked. I felt as though I was eating uncooked popcorn kernals! Despite that, I took a couple more bites but the OJ was just too overwhelming! I hope my garbage disposal enjoyed it! I'm thankful this was cheap to make, otherwise I would be thorougly disgusted! It might be delicious for someone else, but not my cup of tea!!

I make this rice about once a week - it's my husband's absolute favorite!!! It goes with everything, but really well with pork tenderloin and chicken. It's the black pepper that really adds the spice, so cut down on that if it's too spicy for you.  Also, I add chopped mandarin oranges with the cilantro at the end and it really makes it pretty.

Good way to give a little more variety to rice.  Too much orange for me.  Next time I will do 50/50 stock and OJ.  Cilantro and Rice are like peas and carrots.  ;-}>

As this was cooking, I wasn't sure if I liked this dish.  Then, I added the cilantro and was surprised that the flavors combined really well.  I didn't have enough cilantro to equal 1/2 c. so I think the next time will be even better with the right amount of cilantro.  Cooked this with oyster sauce chicken from this site and the two paired well.

This stuff is so good! I love it- it goes along with many things. My favorite is to pair it with a black bean chicken with yogurt! Yum.

pretty tasty, although like many recommended, I reduced the OJ.  I must note that I downsized the recipe for two people and it wasn't nearly enough.  Keep it in mind if you are cooking for 2 like I am!

I wasn't a huge fan of this rice. I cooked exactly to the recipe, and it just wasn't good. My husband and I couldn't even finish. Sorry. :-(

I thought these flavors did not compliment one another at all.  I usually don't throw food away, but nobody would eat it (me included).  Sorry, maybe it's just my family's taste but we normally eat anything with cilantro...?

This was really good, while it was cooking everyone kept commenting on how good it smelled.  It wasn't strong enough to overpower any other dishes, but held up well on its own too.
If you, like me, are unable to find fresh cilantro (most of the stores here don't want to carry it, it seems) then you can find dried cilantro and use extra, letting it sit in there a little longer so it doesn't taste as dry.

This also was a little tough.  Cover it while simmering so that the rice gets softer than it would otherwise.

I made this recipe for a school function and it was a huge hit.  I used orzo (rice sized pasta) instead of rice.  It is very unusual and delicious.  thanks!!

I was looking for an orange rice recipe that I had tasted several years ago.  I saw this and thought I would give it a try, and it was even better than the one I was trying to replace!!!  This will be a keeper in our house.  Even the kids gobbled it up!
