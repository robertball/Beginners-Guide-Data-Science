These were super easy, but the chocolate chips would not spread for me, despite the fact I poured them on the bar immediately after removing from the oven.  I would have preferred the chocolate be more of a ganache-ish full layer on top, rather than a smattering of chocolate chips.  The PB topping was tough to drizzle, too, despite quadrupling the milk to thin it out.  Taste was good, but these were tough to make look "good".  Thanks for the recipe, Briecookinglove!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I did change slightly and made it easier.  I added the chocolate chips to the cookie batter, and omitted the topping all together.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 11x14 cookie sheet.YUMMY!

This is one of my favorites! My aunt makes them often and had given me the recipe, but I didn't have it on hand so I was happy to find it on here! I recommend doubling the peanut butter topping and keep adding milk to the topping until it is able to easily pour over the bars. Then smooth the peanut butter topping over it, mixing it with the soft chocolate chips.

We all loved these bars!    I used mini-chips so had no problem at all with them melting.    I did have to use more milk but it was an easy fix.     We ate them a tad warm and they were great!!    Will make again!    Thanks!

Rating before eating, because like lovestohost posted, could not spread the choc chips.  What a disappointment.  I have another recipe that is cooked at a 400 oven, where the chips are easily immediately spread them.  I even took these out, turned oven up, covered dish with foil and put back in another 5 minutes.  No luck.  But, I guess we should have had a clue looking at the picture given - those choc chips are not melted and spread either.  Waiting for them to cool to try.  Used what was left of caramel sauce, mixed with peanut butter and a little confec sugar and milk to get consistency I wanted to dribble over top.

We all love these. Substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour.  My chocolate chips melted easily (dark chocolate...are people using milk choc. and they don't melt as easily... they would be too sweet for the base I think) and I spread them over using horizontal strokes.   I used lots of milk in the drizzle until like a frosting or fudge sauce consistency and scooped in a ziplock bag, snipped the corner to pipe it.  Made  long vertical stripes over the chocolate layer. Very good but the icing hardened up stiffer over the chocolate layer making it kind of crumble and fall off when cutting cooled bars. Very yummy though.  Next time I plan to put chips in the dough and just PB topping spread on top or  sprinkle REESE's Pieces in the melted chocolate layer and not do the drizzle.

I too put the chips in the batter.  After baking and slightly cooling. I iced with the peanut butter icing, then made a simple chocolate icing to decorate the top.  Very good brownie-like treat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very simply and delicious. I almost skipped the peanut butter drizzle at the end but decided to make it after tasting without..made all the difference!  Only changes I made were wheat flour and greasing the pan with coconut oil which definitely  enhanced the flavors. Definitely making for my next pb and chocolate craving!

Great recipe!  But note, chocolate chips don't melt to spreadable, not even after baking.  I just baked them along on top the bars, cooled 5 minutes, glazed them and let cool rest of the way.

I made this recipe as instructed but when I took the bars out of the oven and turned the oven off, I put the chocolate chips on top of the bars and put the pan back in the off oven for a couple of minutes. I then took the bars out of the oven and the chocolate chips spread wonderfully. Hope this helps as I read some of the other reviews and saw people were having a hard time spreading the chocolate chips so I tried this out and it worked. They turned out great????

These yummy bars turned out perfectly.  They are chewy and delicious and I didn't have any left to bring home!  This recipe goes in my "favorites" box.

I have made these bars several times and are now a family favorite.   I have never made them with the chocolate chip topping and peanut butter drizzle though,  I just make a homemade chocolate buttercream icing for the top.  But the bars themselves are excellent.  I also bake them on a cookie sheet so they are a little thinner.  We love them.

Love it. I put choc chips in the bar and on top. They melted fine and marbled well with the PB frosting. I didn't try to spread them I just marbled them with the frosting with a knife.

I did add the chocolate chips to the dough before baking.  I doubled the peanut butter drizzle and iced the bars with it.  Yummy.

I added a lot more oats (what can I say? I love oats), but didn't add any of the chocolate ingredients. I still did the peanut butter topping. However, to the main batter I also added 1/2 tsp of Pure Almond extract in addition to the vanilla. Had I thought about it while making the peanut-butter topping, I would have also added almond to that. (I love almond-flavored foods far too much). I also added 2 cups of chopped pecans to the batter and, again, like the almond, didn't think to add more pecans to the peanut-butter topping.
The bars are delicious!

I increased the peanut butter amount to 1/2 cup, my mixture was so dry I needed to add 1/4 cup of milk, I added the chocolate chips to the mixture as I didn't want a topping. I baked in  a 9x9 pan as I wanted a bar, baked in 29 minutes. These were good but I doubt I would make again.

My daughter made these and they are delicious. She didn't change anything. We talked about maybe adding rice krispies next time to give it a crunchy texture but taste-wise, they were fine as is.
