The flavour and smoothness are very nice. The taste is clean and fresh. Mine was far too thick to drink. It came out like pudding. I added more almond milk 1/4 cup at a time until I'd almost quadrupled the amount written just to get it to a drinkable consistency. Avocado in a smoothie is a very nice addition in both taste and creaminess though. So, thumbs up over here. Thank you fordmarie for your recipe.

The flavor is very good.  And it is really healthy.  This drink would have 5 stars if the smell wasn't so bad.

The only changes I made was I didn't freeze the banana (you don't need to) and I added 1 1/2 cups of almond milk.  Yum.  If you use the 1/4 cup of almond milk, it is way too thick. You can also add only 1 cup of the milk, and it is still good, just a little thicker. Also, you don't have to pay attention to the size of the avocado, just use any avocado that's ripe. This is delicious !!!!  I have one every day now.

Was delicious! I added more milk and  substituted some blueberries for the banana. Excellent way to include more spinach in your diet . Two thumbs up.

I absolutely loved this smoothie!  I changed the mil ratio from 1/4 C milk to 1 1/4 C milk based on some of the other reviews. I also substituted plain unsweetened almond milk since I have dairy issues.  The texture is creamy just like a milkshake and I love the fact that I already had almost all of the ingredients in my kitchen. Two thumbs up from me!

This was good, but it needs a lot more almond milk.  I used 1 1/2 cups of the unsweetened vanilla almond kind.  It was good, but definitely a change from the fruity flavors I'm used to.  I had no issues with the smell, as noted by other reviewers.

I really liked this recipe! I added a few dashes of cinnamon and used a whole banana and avocado. Tastes great and keeps me full.

I definitely agree that it needs about 1.5 cups of almond milk. Other than that, it was great! Loved the addition of cinnamon!

What a great morning shake! I added matcha powder to the milk and used about a cup of almond milk. Thank you for the recipe!

Pretty good. I don't ever buy almond milk, so I just used normal milk but added almond extract. It's very creamy and tastes fine. But, it was very meh. I don't know if I'll make it again.
