Delicious!  I added pineapple juice, stevia, ground flax and chia.  The ginger and orange make a great combination.

Love this. I chopped up a bit of orange peel first for some zest and I didn't have any ice (no ice maker), so I put the orange and banana and yogurt in the freezer first for a bit. Still turned out yummy!

Delicious!  I did have to improvise a bit.  Used 1 old, dried up orange with a 1/2 tsp. of zest; 1 old, frozen banana that I thawed in the microwave.  After thawing, it was like mush, but so what it's going in a smoothie.  Cut off one end and it slid out like yogurt coming out of a tube so I used the whole banana.  Eye-balled the rest of the ingredients so I may have used a touch more honey.  And, since my orange was so dry, added a splash of raspberry-lemonade I made the day before.  It was either that or grapefruit juice.  Didn't have any other citrus except lemons. Had to use vanilla yogurt.  A wonderful smoothie, thoroughly enjoyed; suggest you try it.  You won't be disappointed.  Can't wait to make it again with fresh fruit.  May even add a little more ginger.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a delicious, refreshing smoothie. Very fruity and perfect for drinking during the hot, humid temps of summer. (But just as good in the cool fall:) I used 2 cuties because I didn't have regular oranges and replaced the honey with stevia.
