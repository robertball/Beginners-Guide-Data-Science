I have made this twice and wow!  The first time I followed it exactly as it is and it turned out great.  The second time I only had 1/4 cup of molasses, so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and it turned out perfectly!  Put some coleslaw on top and it is the perfect sandwich. It was almost gone before I even got any!

This was pretty good.  Tasted like a BBQ sauce.  I added extra molasses and I am glad I did.  Instead of the rub/marinade, I mixed the spices with the molasses, vinegar, mustard, and ketchup and poured it over the pork in the slow cooker because I was starting with a piece of frozen pork.  I cooked it on high for several hours and low for the rest for a total of about 8 hour or so.  Skipping the marinating had no effect on the flavors, and how I did things was super-simple.

Unbelievable! So incredibly good. Only thing I did different was add 1/2 C molasses. Cooked it for 8 hours on high in crock pot. I did not know that pork butt came with a bone so I was a bit leary of using the cooking sauce on sandwiches due to possible bone fragments, something to be aware of. Delicious, tender, easy to prep. Served with Apple coleslaw.

This was very good after a few tweaks! I had a problem with the dry rub..it was TOO dry! So I added another tablespoon of oil. I thought the finished product was a little too tart so I added 1/2 cup of'Sweet Baby Rays' barbeque sauce to the slow cooker after I put the shredded pork back in...then it was PERFECT!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and super easy! I didn't have any molasses so I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup maple syrup which I think really played up the sweetness in the dish. The dish came out beautifully and was much easier than I expected. I sifted the sauce through a very fine colander to remove any bone fragments for safety. It was so delicious!

This would be the first time I've ever made pulled pork and this recipe is outstanding.  My family just loved it!  Definitely will be making this again and again.

This was a very easy recipe!  I prepared it for a Labor Day BBQ, and the compliments just keep coming!  Instead of the butt roast, I used 5 pounds of pork shoulder and it still only took 8 hours to cook.  To thicken the sauce in the crock pot (I ran out of ketchup and mustard) we added some bbq sauce and tonkatsu vegetable sauce.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

if you have no molasses try;
Replace one cup of molasses with one of the following:

    1 cup dark corn syrup, honey or maple syrup
    3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
    3/4 cup granulated sugar, plus 1/4 cup water

Note: These substitutions may alter the taste of your recipe a bit. If the molasses flavor is vital to the success of your recipe, try the brown sugar substitute. Since brown sugar is made from granulated sugar and molasses, it'll be the closest flavor match.

I've made this twice now, and loved it both times. I am always rushed, and by the time I got to putting the pork in it was getting late, so I just dumped all the ingredients in and turned on the cooker. It was delicious without marinating or rubbing.

The second time I cooked it, I did make the rub and rubbed it on prior to cooking. I chilled the meat and sauce separately, and was able to remove some fat from the sauce before reheating.  I served it on whole wheat buns with cole slaw. It was a big hit with both the husband and the teenagers....and me. 

I think the takeaway for me was that it isn't necessary to go through the fuss. Just dump all the ingredients in the cooker and go!

This was wonderful!  I followed the suggestion of many, and I added extra molasses to cut the tang.  I used chipotle chili powder and smoked paprika, because that's what I had in the pantry.  I made this for a family luncheon, along with coleslaw.  Everyone devoured it, and according to my 6 year-old nephew, it was "spot on."  It takes a little time to prep, but it's a simple, delicious, and forgiving recipe that afforded me time to spend with my family instead of slaving over a hot stove.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it really does need extra molasses to help cut the tang.

This was a very good recipe but definitely too acidic. I added about 1/3c. Of brown sugar when I thickened the sauce and that really made the difference to bring this recipe up to 4 stars.

This recipe is great!  I tried it first on the family and everyone loved it! Second time I made it for some friends who needed a bit of a treat,  and they thought it was amazing. Last night I made it for a casual night in with friends and wow! Everyone devoured it.  Very easy  to make, and although I did try altering the recipe a bit according to what other readers suggested, I found it turned out best when I followed the recipe exactly. This has definitely become one of our family favourites!

My husband thought that this was OK, but I really did not like it.  I think that it might have been the vinegar, but I am not sure.  I just know that there was a strong taste in this that I really did not like.  Will not make again.  Sorry.

I liked it, but after reading the reviews, I adjusted as follows; 1/2 C. maple syrup to 1/2 C. vinegar.  I would also put meat and sauce in separate bowls and refrigerate overnight and skim fat.  Will make again.

Just made it for 4H potluck.  It is GONE.  Well received.  Served it with fresh sliced white bread as there was a lot of sauce.   The bread was great for soaking up the sauce left on the plates.  Next time I'll use a bigger roast.

It's great if you half the amount of vinegar and substitute water for the rest.  I also reduce the amount of ketchup to keep the sugar down a bit.

Great base recipe! I used Pork Loin Roast since that's what I had in the freezer, low fat and came out great, with a few changes. Even before reading other's comments I about choked when I saw this called for 1 cup of vinegar.  Since I'm not pickling the meat or myself, I did look at my other pulled pork recipes to see that only 3T, + 1-3T if making own sauce like here (vs bottled bbq sauce), is just right for us, considering the vinegar already in the mustard & ketchup.  I did not use oil with the spices to make a paste, just 'dry rub' it onto the meat and dumped leftover spice into sauce ingredients.  I did decrease the Allspice a bit for our personal taste otherwise hubby & I thought it was a tasty combo!  I used Red Wine vinegar in place of apple cider vinegar, also Dijon mustard instead of Yellow; both more to our liking.  With using the low fat roast, not very juicy, did not need thickening.  When meat done, shredded it & returned to crockpot & sauce, left on low until serving.  Very tasty, will be making again.

I made this on Memorial Day (2012). It was very very good. I cooked a four pound roast, and it was ready in nine hours. The sauce was so good that I reserved and thickened all of it.

I made this recipe as it stated even after reading some of the comments that it was too vinegary.  I have to agree so next time i make it i will reduce the amount maybe by 25% and see.  This is definitely a keeper.  btw i used 3 lbs of pork loin roast. Very nice.  Go ahead and make this recipe !

This was really good! - but a little too vinegary for my tastes. 

I did not marinate, just blended everything together  and poured a little into the bottom of the cooker, then put in the roast, then poured the rest of the sauce over the roast.

I used only about 1/2 tsp black pepper and did not have coriander, and at least doubled the molasses - otherwise, I followed ingredients list.

I accidentally cooked it a little too long and so the meat above the sauce line was dry, but the rest of it was really, really good!

The sauce as too vinegary for my tastes. I like my sauces sweet and smoky. Next time I think I would cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup because there's plenty in the mustard too. And I would still add more molasses or brown sugar. But I would totally use this recipe again. Thanks, Heinz!

I did like it however, next time I will not use as much vinegar.  It ended up pretty tart.

Amazing! Shared it with all my friends and they love it too! Tip: just add a couple of table spoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up

I made it for Super Bowl sunday and was not happy with it.  Our guests told us it was delicious but this will not be a recipe I would follow again.

Great recipe! Late on Saturday night I took out a four-pound pork roast. While still frozen, I put it into the slow cooker, added the spices and sauce ingredients, set it on low, and left it all night to cook. It worked great! At 9 am I shredded the pork, and when I came home from church it was ready to eat. This is a recipe I will definitely do again! I did not have apple cider vinegar (I personally do not like it) so I exchanged it for 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup white vinegar. It worked great and the flavor was incredible!

Warning: made as is, it is VERY tart. Had the bite of a salt and vinegar chip, which did not go over well with my family. Looking back now I can see why, there is no sweetener in it at all. I was able to save our batch with a good amount of brown sugar. I would have to cut back the vinegar if I were to make this again as well.

Easily worth the 10 hours it cooked. You won’t even need two forks to shred it one pair of tongs was enough.

Added 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke to the wet ingredients.  Otherwise, stick with the recipe.  Perfect.

I followed the directions as written and it was fantastic. Just the right mix of tangy, sweet and a small bit of heat.

I made this recipe for the first time. It was worthwhile reading some of the reviews first! I took the advice to skip the marinading step and mixed all ingredients together (except the cornstarch) and poured over the meat in the slow cooker. i cooked the pork shoulder roasts (two totalling about 4 1/2 lb) for 9 hours. Served it on buns. A great success...excellent flavour!

Like many other reviewers, I cut the vinegar in half and added water to make the liquid. I used a little less pepper and chili because we're wimps. SO GOOD. Five stars the way I made it, but I took it down a star because I'm sure if I'd put a whole cup of vinegar in no one would have eaten it.

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I would have done different was to add more of the spices.  My pork roast was bigger than 3 1/2 lbs.  It was 4+.

Thank you Heinzitup.com
