This is (in my humble opinion) the best way to prepare tempeh. I do this whevever I make an easy stir fry with tons of veggies. Add in some crushed red pepper for those who like it spicy and its a great meal even the pickiest meat-eater will love!

This was the first time I had tried/cooked tempeh, and this was a very pleasant surprise.  This recipe is simple and delicious.  I cut the tempeh into one inch squares and fried them on all sides.  The result was "tempeh tots!"  We dipped them in soy sauce, ketchup, and marinara.  Great recipe, thanks!

If you steam the tempeh for 10 min. prior to marinating, it's less bitter, and absorbs the marinade better.  Added a bit of sri racha and chili garlic sauce to the marinade, yum!

I used this recipe for an assessment task for school, and it worked amazingly... it tasted great, and looked even better... in the marinade, some sweet chilli sauce wouldn't go amiss however :) i added that to mine for flavour

it was good, but a tiny bit bland. really super-easy to alter though...add whatever spices you like and it would probably work out well.

instead of salt, you may try the Chicken Maggy Block..
It will make tempeh more crispy and tasty

This was my first time trying tempeh and my first time making tempeh. I'm not a fan. I simply did not enjoy the taste.

I thought this was pretty good, but the flavor really reminded me of fish sticks.  If I could figure out what spice to use to highlight that idea I think they would make an excellent fish sandwich.  Followed the recipe exactly, other than I used some oregano to have the pieces with an alfredo dish

This is a good basic way to make tempeh if you're going to add it to something else.  After cooking the tempeh, I added green and orange bell peppers, zucchini, baby bellas and sweet onions that had been marinating in olive oil, balsamic vinegar and some herbs and served it over rice.  I agree with others who suggested adding soy sauce or spices.  It would also be good with balsamic vinegar added to the marinade.  The possibilities are endless with this basic recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.

I tired this.  I'd say if you don't like tempeh then no recipe can help it.

I tried exactly as recipe called for and did not like. Had a funny aftertaste, though from reading up about tempeh that might be because I used store bought packaged tempeh instead of fresh made. The more fried it was, the better. Tasted fine while eating, kind of like hash-browns. The after taste scares me off though. I'm guessing it's better if the tempeh is fresh made.

Pretty good. I like it with marinara sauce best.
