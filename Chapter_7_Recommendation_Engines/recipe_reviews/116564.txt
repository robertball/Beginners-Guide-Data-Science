This is a very tasty recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed it. The only thing I did different was simmered my roast a little longer. It took about 2 hours for it to get tender.

This has to be the best pot roast recipe I have ever tried. I have been cooking for a long time and no other pot roast recipe can compare.  I can not stand the recipes that call for onion soup mix!  It makes the roast taste very artificial.  This recipe will always be a favorite in my family (my kids love it).  Lots of flavor and great for leftovers! The flavor gets better the next day.

The barbeque sauce recipe is to die for.  I did have to adjust it just a bit.  I didn't have enough lemon juice.  I used half the lemon juice and half lime juices.

This was really good, the only thing I did different was that I used regular mustard instead of dry mustard. Thanks!

Very nice Pot Roast. Made an awful lot of gravy - probably 3x more than needed. Sliced potatoes up and put them in the Dutch Oven with the rest.

This was great, but next time I will make it in the crock pot. I had to cook it so long we ate it the next day. My husband loved it and asked me to make it again! I followed the directions exactly but also added 1/4 c of peach jalapeno jam. Yum!

Very tender.  Make sure to use dutch oven as this can burn on the bottom.  Just before serving, trim fat, slice and return to the sauce.

This is delicious. I used an English roast closer to 2#, and a little extra seasoning before browning. Best to slice thin and let it set in the sauce a few minutes.

easy, tender, and delicious.  I was out of lemon juice but it didn't affect the overall flavor. I threw in some potatoes and carrots.  I bet it would be better the next day, but I wouldn't know because there were no leftovers.

This is recipe great. After having the pot roast for dinner I like to blend up the sauce, tear up the meat and have delicious pulled beef sandwiches the next day for lunch.

This is an excellent dish.  Love the sauce, although I exchanged the can of tomato sauce w/ a half can of tomato soup instead and I also added some beef broth too.  Its very tender and tasty.

This became a common recipe that I make. And i completely agree with the comment about the onion soup mix. Its one of the reasons I tried this recipe in the first place.

This is awesome!  I cut off some fat on the meat first then browned it in the oil in a heavy skillet.  Then I put it in the crock pot on low for 7 hours with some cut up carrots and potatoes!  Incredible sauce and tender, tender, tender!!  Thanks.

My family loved this.  It was really good.  I used the leftovers, including the sauce to make a beef stew.  Double duty recipe!  Yeah!

To be honest - I had low expectations of this dish.  I thought it couldn't be as good as the original "pot roast".  I was delighted as this was very good!  I made it with a serving of rice.  The 2nd night, we made sandwiches.  Very versatile with what and how to serve.

4 stars! This was a very good recipe. I did not have any lemon juice, so I substituted red wine vinegar and it was great! I also braised it in a 325 oven for two hours, then pulled the meat out and reduced the sauce to thicken it a bit. I will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe.  I had a 1.5lb so i had to let it cook closer to 2 hours after adding all the ingredients.  I added potatoes which went awesome.  Very simple recipe.
