We really loved this. It tasted like strawberry milk, we couldn't even detect the alcohol in it. It was great as it was, but if I were in the mood for a stronger drink, I might add an additional ounce of the schnapps or maybe even Vanilla Twist or Baha Rosa.

Wicked. It does taste like strawberry milk. It's good, but I don't know if I'll make it again. It's just not my speed. Cool trick, though.

This was an interesting change of pace but not sure I would make it again.  It didn't really taste like strawberry anything.
