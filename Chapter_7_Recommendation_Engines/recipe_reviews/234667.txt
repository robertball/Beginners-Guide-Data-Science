This was amazing!!! I wouldn't change anything,  I love the mixture of chives, tarragon, and thyme added to the sauce,  I had a hard time finding shiitake mushroom so I used regular button mushrooms.  It was really good,  Will be making this again soon!!

This was really easy, and it was outstanding! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, with one small change- instead of 8 oz of heavy whipping cream, I only used about 4 oz, and then I added about 3 oz of sour cream that I had left over from another recipe. Some reviews have said that the sauce is very runny, but mine wasn't at all. Be sure to cook the mushrooms long enough for the liquid to evaporate and they start to brown- not only does that reduce the amount of liquid, it gives the mushrooms a great flavor. Also be sure to let the sauce reduce a bit after adding the sherry, and again after adding the cream. It'll thicken up nicely if you give it the time it needs! So good.

A little bland, needs more spice for the amount of meat.  Pulled the pork shoulder apart when done, broiled to crisp it with a little bourbon and oj to bring out the flavor more. Excellent when completed.

Oh my goodness!!!! I absolutely loved this! My husband liked it, but he is a spicy type of guy, so a little bland for him, but he said it was good. I used minced garlic, a big heap of it. I only had dried herbs, not fresh, so I added them in the cream and cooked them, rather than adding at the end. No sherry, but my husband had some Chardonnay, so I used that. And when it came to the Parmesan, well, we are cheese freaks, so I used more than the recipe calls for.  I will make this a common dish in this house. Next time I will be adding artichokes, my husband requested it. It is a very runny sauce, so next time I may try what another reviewer suggested and use sour cream rather than whipping cream.  If you find it is bland, try upping all the herbs and garlic and cheese. I love it as is, but for some people this is probably a great base  to build on.

First time ever writing a review. I found Chef John's Chicken Kiev recipe a few months ago and was gobsmacked at how well it worked - so I thought I'd try this. This dish is incredible. I used the recipe exactly as is using fresh  herbs (maybe extra garlic). I used excellent quality stock and premium parmigiano. It was not bland at all. If you use dried herbs, cheap stock, cheap parmigiano and omit the sherry, what do you expect other than bland? Only other alteration was I couldn't get Shitake so I used some dried porcini which I re-hydrated and poured the juice in. I am not normally a tarragon fan. This was just sensational. I cook a lot. I rarely say this. Thanks Chef John!!!

I made this exactly to the recipe the first time.  Quite good as Chef John's recipes usually are.  I thought it could be better as I was looking for something to serve to my foodie friends at our quarterly wine pairing dinner.  So, my tweaks were: 1. I used about 1 1/4 lb gourmet mushrooms and Shiitakes rather than the white mushrooms. I'd like to try it with Chanterelles and Morels the next time they are in season.  2.Cook the mushrooms in a stainless steel skillet.  After the liquid boils away, keep cooking and stirring. The mushrooms will start to stick to the bottom of the skillet. Keep cooking until the bottom of the skillet has a good coating of browned mushroom bits. This technique seems to get way more mushroom flavor in the sauce than browning the mushrooms in a non-stick skillet.  3. I de-glazed with 1/2 cup dry white wine instead of the 2 ounces of sherry.  This releases all of those tasty browned bits for the sauce.  4. I increased the amount of fresh herbs from 1.5 tsp each to nearly 1 Tbsp each.  Basically, twice what the recipe called for.  I also put a bit more Parmesan in the sauce. 5. I made my own Fettuccine noodles.  Other than that, I followed the same recipe and the results were significantly more flavorful.  VERY good.  I paired this dish with a Northern California Pinot Noir and it was a big hit with my friends.  One other tip:  Don't skip the chance to adjust the seasoning after the cream.  The salt balance is really important to get the best flavor.

Great recipe, but you actually need to follow it. Some reviewers complain it is too watery, but that is only if you rush it. It takes a little longer, but if you give it the necessary time, the thickness will be perfect. I added a bit more garlic and fresh herbs, effectively to taste, and liked it. 100% would do again.

This was so decadent and rich I was literally swooning with every bite. I used bowtie aka farfalle pasta cause that is what I had on hand and I was licking my plate. You said something inspired a proposal from a recipe in the video. Well, when I tasted this, I was ready to propose to Chef John! And we are both already married!! Love, love, love this recipe. Great for company or for drowning your sorrows after a bad week.

Truly a fantastic recipe.  It's the most successful result I've ever had with a recipe here, I'm just thrilled!  I don't usually do reviews, I'm really not a good cook and am never sure if it's me or the recipe.  This one must be foolproof, if I can do it surely anyone can.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added another garlic clove and red wine.  My store didn't have crimini, I used a package of pre-sliced "baby bella" mushrooms;  the flavor was amazing.   And the perfect touch with the herbs.

This is the very first review I have written and, as I am a devoted Chef John fan, it is not surprising that it is one of his recipes that I am reviewing.  I have made this pasta many times already and it is a huge favorite of our family!  I make it exactly according to the recipe.  Thanks Chef John!!!!!

the only difficulty i had was making the cheese melt. I've tried 2 different ones and both created a glob, but it was so good I ate the glob too.

Deeeeelicious!! Used portobello mushrooms instead. Added a few extra garlic cloves. Didn't have fresh tarragon & thyme on hand so used a little less in dried form.  After drained pasta I put it back into empty warm pot. Just yummy. Try it.

A very nice Alfredo with herbs. You can also substitute pasta water for cream bringing more of the mushroom flavor out and save a few calories. Well done.

I subbed the seasoning with fresh parsley, rosemary and thyme and it was de-lish! I also used a parmesan-romano-asiago blend for the cheese and that was top notch.  I always use 4x the amount of garlic any recipe calls for and did so here as well which was yummy, but I felt like this could use another 8oz of mushroom to make it heartier, and perhaps more sauce would be needed as well. Overall this is a great recipe to build off of, plenty of flavor.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes ever!! Baby Bella Mushrooms work just fine if you can’t get a hold of shiitake. Also, if you REALLY want to do it right at the end, throw some fresh grated Locatelli Pecorino Ramano cheese in to cream sauce and serve some right on top

This sauce is such an amazing addition to steak with a glass of Cabernet. Such a delicious sauce that you can put this with chicken and rice or with chicken and fettuccine pasta. You can have this with red or white meats.

So good! I couldn’t get shiitake mushrooms so I used portobellos. It’s even better the next day!

Chef John produces another winner!  I have made this a few times.  Made as the recipe is written, this is great.  It is forgiving enough to substitute Marsala wine if you don’t have sherry, and leave the tarragon out of you don’t have that (though it is better with).  I’ve used whole milk instead of cream, which is passable, but cream is best.  In other words, you can still make a delicious dish if you are forced to substitute, but do try and make it as written for best results.

I browned chicken breasts then added the mushrooms to cook and used a dark wine instead of sherry and the dish came out perfectly. My wife dislikes mushrooms but cleaned her plate when I prepared this for her.

Made exactly as the recipe stated except I used Gemelli shaped pasta, which does a good job of collecting sauce and still looks lovely on the plate.  This is simply heavenly. This mushroom pasta is indistinguishable from a dish I crave from a very expensive Italian restaurant near us; the kind of restaurant we only go to once or twice a year. Now I can eat this more often, and I get to feel all proud that I made something so yummy! Thank you Chef John!

Another 5 stars for Chef John! How do you do it? This was a lovely Saturday night pasta dish. We felt like we were in a fine dining restaurant. Made EXACTLY as written, right down to weighing the mushrooms and this is a dish to impress. Will definitely made this again. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I don't rate recipes often.  I am rating the sauce.  I agree with other folks about it being a little bland and a little thin consistency for my taste.  That being said... Great non-meat recipe.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have heavy cream BUT used Chef Johns Creme Fraische as a substitute.... That added Great flavor.  Next time what I will do is use half the chicken stock and maybe add extra parm.   I also think I will keep the sauce and pasta (Angel hair next time) separate and serve on individual plates or bowls.  Thanks again Chef John!!

Great dish! Seems very gourmet for such easy preparation. The only thing I changed was 1 more clove of garlic and some Cheyenne.  Extra tasty... use a good Parmesan! Quality really makes a difference here.

Made this for the first time last night. It tasted very good but the sauce was thin so I added some sour cream to thicken. Will try it again to see if I did something wrong. Thank you, Chef John. I always like your creations.

Wanted to thank chef John. Delicious sauce!  Will make again. Only Baby Bella and white mushrooms at grocers. Used 1/2 lb of each. Mushrooms in broth would not thicken even slightly. Added about 3 oz or cream cheese (cubed very small) heated, melted into sauce  and proceeded with rest of recipe.

 I  tossed my home made fettuccini with some butter & parmesan and 1/4 C chopped parsley.  Then sauced over with added  sprinkle of parsley garnish. This was just great and disappeared immediately. Next time I might  do a bit more than one  lb. of mushrooms.  This is a keeper

Delicious!!! Only adjustment I made was adding a shallot and drizzling some white truffle oil add the end, so amazing!  Modified herbs to sage and thyme as that’s what I had on hand, a definite repeat!

I made this with the bare minimum as I was clearing out the fridge. No shitakes, only crimini mushrooms that were on their last legs and needed to be used. Also, I only had dried herbs and half and half cream. Even with that it was very good.   I did double the garlic (always do) and perked it up with some  wild mushroom and sage olive oil I had on hand. Next time I will try and make it with the shitakes and all fresh ingredients . Don't skimp on the cheese! I could also see incorporating some grilled chicken breast if you increased the amount of sauce.  Chef John  delivers consistently impressive and reliable recipes. He's worth following!

This is a very easy, delicious  busy day dinner. On the table in less than half an hour.  If you don't have fresh herbs, it's still very tasty using dried (at the time you add the broth).

I made this but changed the ingredient amounts a bit and added some cream cheese. I used the same amt of mushrooms, but decreased the cream to 5 oz, upped the sherry to 3 oz, used No-chicken broth, used dried herbs as follows: 2 tsp dried chives, 2 tsp dried tarragon, 1/4 tsp dried thyme and added 2 heaping Tbsp of whipped cream cheese. I also added 2 Tbsp butter to the  pasta before adding the mushroom sauce. I also added 3/4 cup frozen peas (thawed/warmed in the microwave before adding). It came out amazing! Thank you for a wonderful basic mushroom-alfredo sauce which I could manipulate and make my own. I called mine Fettucine De La Nona!

So tasty! The only thing I had to do was sprinkle some flour into the pan and stir well to thicken the sauce before serving. I will add this to my repertoire of Vegetarian-friendly dishes. Thanks Chef John. ????

I did not have any shiitake mushrooms, so I substituted a huge Portobello mushroom cut into pieces, along with white mushrooms. The recipe was great and I used spaghetti because I did not have the pasta that Chef John called for. The flavor was great.

I really like the way the flavors come together - makes the sauce a lot more interesting than just plan alfredo.  I couldn't find fresh tarragon at the store, so I left that out, but had some fresh parsley handy, so I added that instead.   It could also work with some bacon or chicken mixed in.  I may try that next time.

An amazing recipe.  I have made it 3 times and it gets better each time.  Make sure you allow enough time for the mushrooms to properly cook so all the water evaporates.  This is not a quick recipe but it is really worth the effort, which is mostly just giving it enough time.

I followed the directions as written, and it was very good.  I personally will use less mushrooms and omit the tarragon next time. We had a lot of mushrooms left over after everyone picked around them. But loved the mushroom flavor they gave.  Thanks for the recipe.

Chef John, I don't know who you are but I love you and your recipes.  This was SOOOO good my whole family ate it. (very picky eaters) I did not have sherry so I replaced it with red wine vinegar.  Wow. Superb.

I didn’t have all the fresh herbs, so I used a few shakes of Italian herb mix and it was still wonderful. I also used a mix of mushrooms from the farmers market.  Yummy!!

I made this exactly as directed and was please. My personal tastes think it was a little too much mushroom and possibly needed a little more “spice”. Definitely going to make again and try to adjust it just a little. All in all a wonderful recipe. Thank you Chef John. I look forward to trying some more of your recipes.

This was delicious! I've made some few alterations. Since I was out of fettuccine, I've use spaghetti. Instead of sherry, I've  used red cooking wine. I didn't have any chives and skipped it. I would make it again.

This was even better than i thought it was going to be, and i thought it was going to be really good. Cream-based sauces can be so heavy, but this one really wasn't. I can't agree with the reviewers who say the dish is bland. I thought that the flavors were subtle, sure, but the mushrooms lent a beautiful depth to the sauce. You can adjust the amount of the seasoning and a bit more salt can do wonders.

Changes: I used a full pound of white mushrooms and cooked the sauce on low for an additional ten minutes beyond the time stated in the recipe in order to thicken it up. Used a Lustau amontillado sherry, which is darker than the fino variety.

I only had white mushrooms and used white cooking wine instead of sherry. I threw in some roughly chopped sundried tomatoes near the end and it brightened it up beautifully! Great (and forgiving) recipe!

I followed the recipe as usual the first time. It was delicious, and I will definitely be making this again.  I must admit, my mushrooms were watery too, as mentioned in another's comments, and I did cook the mushrooms until they were Brown and I could smell their nutty aroma. So I drained off the liquid before continuing on with the recipe.  Even with doing that, it was still not as thick as I like, so I added just a hint of corn starch, and that thicken it up perfectly.  Thank you for sharing, it's a keeper!

Fantastic if you like mushrooms which our fam does.  I didnt have taragon or chive and used 3/4 tsp dried thyme and it turned out very tasty. Cooked a few mins longer to thicken more before adding parm and it was borderline too thick. Gave a good coating to the spiral pasta. Stick with the times suggested and have faith and should have a nice creamy sauce. Cant wait to make again with all the proper flavors!!

I had the most amazing meal last night and this was it! Everything about it was divine. I followed the recipe to the T... except I didn't have any tarragon, so I left that out. I used fresh herbs from my garden which made the meal even more special. I served it is a sweet Italian sausage link to make it a little more sustaining for me. Delish! Post a pic? Please... this didn't last long enough to take a pic.

YUM!  Chef John really rocked this one.  Seeing as I’m not a vampire, I doubled the garlic. I confess, I also added extra mushrooms.  The only bad thing was how quickly it was consumed.  Only a tiny tad was left which is a shame as it is even better the next day. Must make again SOON!

It tasted good but was difficult to make due to so many steps. I learned something about sautéing mushrooms with patience. I couldn’t find nice fresh chives so I used dried I wasn’t sure how much to use or perhaps to put in earlier - the taste was mild. I also used vegetarian stock so maybe that was not so wonderful.

I never make changes! I try the recipe as is. That’s the point? Right? 
This was really good - chef Johns recipes are always great. 
If you’re tempted to make changes then submit your own recipe.  
I get so frustrated with reviews that alter everything and end up with a recipe of their own. 
Seriously, fellow foodies!!! Submit your own recipe!!! 
Thanks chef John for another truly delectable recipe!!  
PS - to all the cooks who change every thing or don’t follow instructions - try it as is!!!   If you don’t have ingredients called for / go to store or start over and submit your own recipe!!!!

Use fresh herbs as called for.  Use Sherry, not cooking Sherry / it’s not the same. 
Find Shitake mushrooms/ they are available in most larger grocery stores / they add a distinct and flavorful addition, coupled with the simple button mushrooms it’s the perfect combo.  
The flavor is incredible combined with all of the other ingredients.

I love mushrooms and you can use any combination you like. It was filling but you didn’t feel like it was to much. My husband and I are the ones who like mushrooms so I saved for when we were alone. I would definitely make again and if anyone likes  meat they can always add chicken but I prefer mushrooms only and extra cheese. I’m taking leftovers for lunch. Yum

I loved the sauce, but the time for the fettuccine was wrong,it said 8 minutes (maybe for fresh that was right but not for box), I cooked it for 10 but it should be 12 for box....I will make it again, but please state fresh time and dry time.

This was very, very good. I'd make it again in a heartbeat . Takes a little longer to cook, they must have a range with faster simmer:) 
Worth the effort!!

Yes, I used evaporated milk instead of cream (only because
I had none) and dried herbs instead of fresh.  I plan to make
it again and go by the recipe!

I added chicken and more mushrooms because my daughters love them.   I also agree with another reviewer that it could have used some more garlic and Parm, because there is no such thing as too much garlic.

Over all, I really enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it a gain

My husband is a mushroom lover so I thought I'd make this for him as a surprise after a rough work week. He loved it. I loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except next time I won't let it simmer as long. But the mushrooms held their shape and and the spices were perfect. This is going in my very favorites box!

Both hubby and I really liked it and will  make it again.  I didn't use the sherry and used half and half instead of cream. I don't have good luck at adding the cheese and getting it to melt (it always clumps for me) so will use it on top next time.

My husband and I loved this dish. We love pasta and could eat it several times a week. I made this as written, but having made it once I have been thinking of additions and alterations I might do in the future. But nothing extra is needed. I like it being a vegetarian dish. The only thing I couldn’t find in the recipe was the number of servings. The two,of us ate it all!

Fabulous! Used baby portobellos as what I had.  Cooked so leaving bits in pan and after adding a good 5-7 cloves garlic deglazed with the 2 T sherry but also some Chardonnay. Must get those bits into sauce. Did not have fresh herbs so used dry and no chives so added green onions - the green parts. Added 1/4- 1/2 t red pepper flakes for subtle heat. This was such a delicious dish. Served over angel hair - can’t remember serving portions for recipe but I rendered flavors down and only made 2 servings. Absolutely will make over and over. It is a forgiving recipe to substitute what you have on hand. I had to use a jar parm /reg cheese since did not have fresh on hand. Dried herbs- can’t imagine how stellar it will be with fresh. Recipe is a true hit Chef John- thank you.

One word describes this dish. YUM!  I followed recipe as much as I could short of adding 3/4tsp dried chives and 3/4tsp dried thyme. It’s what I had on hand. I did brown some chicken I cut up and added it at the end. Hubby demands some form of protein. Served over a kale pasta.

I substituted half n half for the cream and sauteed some shrimp in another pan, just before serving.  I added the shrimp to the sauce.   I had no chives or the fresh version of the herbs, so I used diced onions and dry herbs.  Was just fine.

There’s no other narrator like Chef John. His recipes are top notch as well. This is one of my wife’s favorites and mine too. We always add almost twice the mushrooms and love it!

Amazing.  I've never made a pasta sauce that wasn't thick, so this seemed wrong while I was making it, but wow, it is great.  Wife and son loved it.  They are picky too.  I am going to keep making Chef John's recipes.

Wonderful recipe.  Thanks to Chef John.  Also, a great recipe for adding options.  I squeeze 1/2 lemon over the top before serving and add a bit of parsley

This was delicious! Made it according to the recipe, no changes. Great with a nice N.Y. strip steak! We will definitely be making this again soon.

I  added a thin sliced chicken cutlet. i would use more mushrooms (since they cook down so much) and more herbs and spices. Overall a very yummy dinner.

This was delicious, even though I made a few changes! I left out the parmesan and sherry, and subbed taragon with chopped fresh basil. Think the sage in thyme in this recipe really improved the flavour. Looking forward to making this again! :)

Just made this. Very good! Only had white mushrooms, used dried thyme and tarragon - 1 tsp each, no chives. Used 4 cloves of garlic. Used real sherry not cooking sherry. I did add some cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper to my dish as I like a bit of a kick. I would make again but use a mixture of mushrooms as called for. I think it would add even more flavor. Maybe even a drizzle of fresh lemon juice. ??

Great recipe. I added a whole shallot with the mushrooms, about five minutes in. Also did three large cloves of garlic instead of two. I only had dry thyme, so added with the cream to let the flavors open a bit. Copious amount of fresh black pepper and a nice Himalayan salt, season to taste throughout. Finished with some fresh parsley and Locatelli. Left out the tarragon. Mangia.

Although the flavor was good, the sauce never thickened - maybe because I used fat free half n half.

Very delicious. I only had baby bellas and used white wine instead of sherry as that's what I had.  Served over mushroom raviolis and everyone loved it.  Will be making again.

This was AMAZING! Served it over ravioli instead of fettucini. I used 4 oz whole milk and 4 oz heavy cream instead of 8 oz heavy cream and it was still soooooo rich. Believe it or not, omitted the cheese at the end. Cannot imagine how rich it would have been following it to the letter! Recipe is a keeper

My family loved it.  My 10 yr old asked me to make it again the next day. I did not have cream so substituted half & half and sour cream. I also substituted green onions for chives. ( what I had in house) Turned out wonderful!

Very good. I made it with 8 oz chicken and 8 oz mushrooms to make more of high protein meal. 
Was a little bland - added a little allspice at the end which suited my tastes. I appreciate how Chef John points out that recipes are meant to be adjusted to suit individual tastes. 
Would recommend and will definitely make again.

Excellent flavor... made as directed except added more garlic, subbed Pinot noir for sherry (no sherry in the house) and cooked chicken separately to add for protein. The fresh herbs make such a difference. Will make again!

i had to substitute a couple items but the end product was fantastic.  i replaced the sherry for a red wine i had on hand and i used half and half instead of the heavy cream - didn't seem to affect the taste or outcome of the dish - it was absolutely delicious!!!   I would definitely make this again

We have made this dish many times, having both followed the recipe exactly and using our own minor twists, and it is delicious every time.  Change up the pasta, change up the mushrooms (baby bellas with the white mushrooms), it's all good - and our favorite homemade pasta dish by far!

So delicious! Used vermouth in place of the sherry, and angel hair instead of fettuccine.

This is a great recipe! Tasted as good as it looked i did change a few things, I used bow ties instead, I did portobello mushrooms, and a white wine I had in my fridge! Over all wonderful flavors!

This was really good. The sauce goes a lot farther than the recipe so you can use more pasta. I also browned some chicken breast strips , removed them from the pan and added them back later.

It's a Chef John recipe so yes, of course, it came out very good. Followed his instructions and it came out really flavorful. Only thing I would change next time is cut the recipe down a little, way too much for only two people but great for 3 or 4. It took me longer to make this then stated in the recipe but that's nothing new, it always does. Guess I don't chop fast enough so I would leave a little extra time then it calls for. Another Chef John success story!

This is a delicious sauce!! I followed the recipe perfectly minus the herbs (I had none) and used red wine instead.  I will always use this as my go-to mushroom sauce now :) Thanks!

I was missing a few ingredients including the Tarragon and Sherry. I used alternative spices and White Cooking Wine to make up the difference. This means the taste was a little different than what it should have been. With that being said, it was very yummy!

I read the reviews about lack of flavor so combined this recipe and some elements of Chef John's mushroom soup (ex. Added onions, cooked longer (an hour) etc. Worked!

One of our favorites! I use a good red wine instead of the sherry, and I substitute with baby bella mushrooms. Gives it a meaty flavor and texture.   I serve over cheese tortellini , which makes for a hearty, very rich meal. Delicious!

I love this recipe.  It is one of my favorites and even my kids will eat it.  The original recipe is still five stars, even though I omitted the sherry.   After the first time making it, I do add more garlic as a personal preference and substitute a touch of vanilla for the sherry.  It's still delicious.

Just made this tonight. I doubled the liquid, as my husband likes a lot of sauce on pasta, and it was great! It was a bit thin for my taste, so I thickened it with a little flour/water sort of roux. And I didn't have the spices called for, so I substituted with some I had on hand and like. Definitely a good recipe!

Made this dish, half recipe, for our anniversary and my husband liked it better than the steak, and he loved the steak - grilled to perfection.  I made it again, full recipe, 3 days later. Topped with rotisserie chicken.  We are this dish five out of seven days.  Hubby still wants this at least once a week. This dish will save a marriage

OMG, first time trying to cook mushrooms and it came out so divine ! great recipe, i skipped the cheese part at the end and the fresh herbs because i didn't have them on hand and still came out like restaurant style flavor. also, I used white Zinfandel wine instead. definitely cook it again again. thank you Chef John, I love your recipes.

An amazing recipe. I have tried it twice so far. We were equally impressed each time. I have replaced the fresh mushrooms with dried Porcini mushrooms in my second time cause I didn't have fresh mushrooms. It worked as well. I love this recipe. Thank you chef John. We are big fans of your recipes. Highly recommended.

Great even though I was missing ingredients!  I had only baby bellas, none of the spices required, no cheese, and no whipping cream!  I used half and half, rosemary as the spice and added more garlic.  It didn't thicken up probably because of the half and half, so I added a tsp of cornstarch to a tablespoon of half and half and added that.    It thickened after simmering a few minutes, and I used it over linguine.  
The only thing I couldn't really replace was the parmesan, and that would have made it perfect.  Next time I will get all the ingredients-this was good, but I can tell following the recipe would be awesome!  But I had a million mushrooms to use NOW-and this was a great use for them, thank you!
