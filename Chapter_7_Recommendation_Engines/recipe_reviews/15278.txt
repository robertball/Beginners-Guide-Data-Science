Original Kourambiethes have almond added in the dough and usually vanilla extract, rosewater and brandy, not anise or ouzo. Moreover, it is very important that you use the right kind of butter. In Greece sheep's butter is used for its distinct aroma and flavour. And the biscuit should be left to cool before you dust the sugar over it, otherwhise it makes a not so appealing crust.

I'm afraid no one in my family liked these.  The you may try less Anise, if you're inclined to try them.

The texture on these was acceptable but I'll probably cut back a bit on the flour in the future. REMOVE the anise. Or cut it back to about 1 tsp if you like a bit of the flavor. You're much better off substituting half vanilla half almond extract and sprinkling with rosewater before putting the powdered sugar on them. Rosewater is available in Indian and Mediterranean sections relatively cheap ($3-5 in my area) and tastes great even on standard shortbread.
