Delicious and pretty simple to make! Both myself and my husband (who can be pretty picky) LOVED this recipe!

So easy!!  I use this recipe all the time.  I make batches of Manicotti and Canelloni using these pancakes then when I don't feel like cooking I get a tray out and pop it in the oven.  They freeze fantastically!  If you make these you will never buy Manicotti shells in the grocery store again!  Worth the time and effort!

This was exactly what I wanted. Everything was perfect. Pancakes came out just the way my mother and grandmother made.  Restored my lost family recipe.

A big hit even with my picky eaters. If you want a thicker pasta, use less water and keep the diameter of the "pancake" tighter. You can use cooking spray between batter additions for an easy slide off onto your cooling plate.

Made these to try with a cannelloni bake, but decided I like the texture of pasta rather than this crepe.  Thank you!

These were terrific. Didn't have four eggs, so only used three and they were perfect. Thanks Ted!

I had to add a little more water to get them thin enough, but after that they worked fine.

Great recipe.  Try these in lasagna.  You can make really big ones in an electric skillet.  Just make sure your sauce is thick.  These will not absorb sauce the way pasta does.
