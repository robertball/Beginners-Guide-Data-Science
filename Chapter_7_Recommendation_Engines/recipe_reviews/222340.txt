The Christmas guests were awed by the presentation as much as the taste.

This Goose was the undisputed star of the easiest, most elegant, and delicious holiday meal ever!   We served the beautiful bird with an arugula, orange and fennel salad, sweet potato with rosemary and Parmesan stacks, garlicky mashed new potatoes, and wild rice, followed by  a plum pudding and lemon sauce dessert.   I am one of those cooks who can rarely enjoy a meal after preparing it, but even I am clamoring for an encore.  I do think I will change the wine next year, though.  A pinot noir, maybe.
