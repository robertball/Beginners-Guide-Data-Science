Wow, this was amazing.  Combining zucchini with clams a great tasty idea.  I did adjust the recipe because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  I used only 3 eggs and used scallions instead of onions.  Also, my zucchini was shredded not diced because I had extra shredded zucchini from zucchini bread I was baking.  And I used half a cup of clam juice with half a cup of milk.  Sorry, I know these changes might affect the results so I plan to make this exactly next time.  I just had to say thank you for a great recipe. UPDATE: yep, made it again this week and this time followed the recipe to a "T" (well, almost, I still had to use shredded zucchini because husband hates zucchini so I have to make it as invincible as possible) but boy, was it good.  I made this twice in one week so I think that speaks volumes.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Living as far inland as I do, razor clams aren't something I've ever seen. I used canned clams, drained, instead. I felt these needed a little extra seasoning. I may try these again with my homemade seasoned bread crumbs and some extra garlic. My batter was extremely thin, so I did add extra bread crumbs and flour (and salt and pepper) to make them more of a drop consistency. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I made this and it was excellent!  I recalculated the the servings for our small family.  The only thing I did add in addition was 2 teaspoons of chicken flavoring.  I will definately make this again for my family.  They all loved it.

This was really easy to make. I used a full cup of surf clams from the beach, ground up and chopped.  The batter was a little loose, so I tightened it up with more flour and bread crumbs. I shredded the zucchini in the food processor.  Served with homemade zucchini relish tartar sauce, this made a great lunch.

Delish!  I used rolled oats (1/2 cup + 1/8 cup) since I didn't have bread crums handy, just pulsed them in the blender for 15 seconds, added some Italian seasoning, and then pulsed again for 5 more seconds.  I also made a sauce for the fritters: plain yogurt, salsa, sriracha sauce, minced garlic, salt and pepper all mixed together to taste.  Yum!  My husband loved them!  He's a big crab cake fan and he said it reminded him of those.

Pretty darn tasty, but were somewhat mushy in the middle even when brown on the outside.

I used little neck clams as we are land locked, and razor clams were not available.  As tiny as little necks are, I made "fritters" of them with the batter and fried.  They were delicious and all my guests thought so, too!

I made these for dinner tonight.  I used 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1 cup and it worked fine.  I did not have fresh razor clams and used canned.  Whole family enjoyed

I didn't change a thing, and they were delicious. Light, crispy, not oily, very tasty. Thanks, I will be making this once or twice a month from now on :)

We used (freshly frozen) razor clams  that we dug, and followed the recipe except added a small amount of fish seasoning and used shredded zucchini. The fritters were mushy in the middle, so we put in the oven to cook while we made the remainder of the recipe. We all like this recipe, but the recipe needs more seasoning (like Old Bay?) in it to make it taste better as it was pretty bland tasting. Probably won't try this one again as we prefer the razor clams fried whole in bread crumbs better.

The store didn't have zucchini so I put in green pepper  instead. It was pretty good, but mine looked a lot different than their picture! We have a lot of razor clams and I never knew what to make with them, but this is a keeper.

These are very tasty...yum. Usually I just fry up our razor clams using egg, flower and saltine crackers. I'm glad I tried something different.

Made for a party.  Everyone loved them.  Used canned clams.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I made a dipping sauce with cream cheese and cocktail sauce to serve with.  SO good.

We followed the recipe to a tee, but the 'batter' came out way too runny. I'm not sure what we did wrong, if anything. So, we added an extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of flour and it was still pretty runny. It was very yummy like that, but next time we might try 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs and 1 cup of flour and see how that turns out.
