Superb! This reminded me of a garlic lemon steamed broccoli that Applebee's used to have on their weight watchers menu. (I'm not into ww, but the standard menu carried plain broccoli). The roasted method is 10x better! I served this over some noodles topped with fresh grated mozzarella and served as a vegetarian entree to the thrill of my teen daughter. Great recipe- and simple!

Two word review: Absolutely Divine! 

Prepared this recipe as directed, but with all the fresh veggies I had in the fridge: broccoli, cauliflower and green beans, and without a word of a lie... IT WAS PERFECTION! 

Didn't have lemon zest, so subbed in plain old lemon juice. Hubby thought garlic drizzle was too much, but then again, sometimes salt is too spicy for him so please disregard his opinion in this matter. 

(Note: if you have a garlic adverse freak in your household,  hold the garlic, drizzle, remove their portion, add garlic to remaining drizzle to use on remaining portions and enjoy. I'll begrudgingly admit that the lemony roasted veggies are beautiful on their own but VIVA LA GARLIC!)

This was my first time trying roasted broccoli and I loved it. So simple, quick and delicious. It didn't really seem like it took 40 minutes to prepare this. It was perfectly roasted with a slight char (which I love) at 15 minutes. It was done before I knew it!

I  topped it with panko and shredded Parmesan cheese and popped it under the broiler for a minute or so.  Crispy and perfect.  Even the children loved it.

This is delicious. I found the lemon and olive oil flavors a little strong, but it is the perfect light meal.

Making it for the second time, you should love garlic & lemon flavors if you want to enjoy this.  Don't over roast the brocoli, sparingly pour the garlic/lemon/olive oil over, so awesome

Well it calls for 2 tsp lemon zest but couldn't find in the recipe where the other tsp was supposed to go? Maybe made it wrong cause was a little to lemony for me. Still enjoyed though. Thank you!

Was much better than any other roasted broccoli I made. I liked the tangy garlic vinaigrette.

Yummy! the only thing I did different was that I used lemon pepper instead of lemon zest. I will definitely make this again.
