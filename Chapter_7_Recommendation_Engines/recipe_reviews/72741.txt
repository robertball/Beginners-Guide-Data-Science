These were the BEST dumplings I've ever made. The only thing I did different was to cut the recipe in half and add a pinch of black pepper to the dough. I rolled the dough very thin (1/8 inch or less) cut them in small squares with my pizza cutter and put them on a floured cookie sheet to dry all afternoon. I let my chicken broth come to a boil and added the dumplings then turned down the heat, covered the pan and let them cook for about 8 min. They were just like grandma's!! Nice and thin and tender. Not gummy or doughy at all. I added my chicken after the dumplings were cooked. I thickened the broth with alittle flour mixed with cold water and served with mashed potatoes and biscuts. What a wonderful dinner on a cold night.

These are very very good dumplings and very easy to make. The only changes I made was adding a little more (maybe a tablespoon) liquid and if you are making dumplings - not pasta-  drop them in right after cutting them and they will be tender

hey, this recipe was great!
i was looking for a good dumpling recipe, and this was the one.  i really liked how you focused on the dumpling, not so much the soup you cook it in.  (so i wasn't afraid to be a veggie stealing the dumpling recipe from "chicken and dumplings")  super easy recipe, made it in a jiffy, then got to focus all my creativity on the soup.  i felt motivated to experiment around with what i had in the kitchen.  didn't have any broth or stock, so i improvised my own base (i don't ever homecook soup other than miso).  i heated some butter in a large pot, added in my chopped red onion, some shredded carrots, cremini mushroom chunks, & chive.  then salted, garlic powdered, and sugared, (something i learned from asian cooking) four cups of water, & a quick splash of milk for some opacity.  i cut my  dumplings pretty slopily, so some were a lot bigger than others, but they all tasted uniform.  you know when they are done, because they ALL float.  before serving, i added some chopped green onion, and enoki mushrooms.  turned out to be a nice somewhat light & fresh, but very hearty soup.  presentation was nice in a glass bowl.  i recommend serving immediately; if you wait too long to eat the soup... the dumplings suck in a bunch of liquid, and become much more dense & gummy (which isn't too bad, but i did like the fluffier version better, it went better with my light soup)

I made these and they were perfect. Reminded me of my grandmothers. I did let them dry for about 4 hours before cooking them though as I recall my grandmother having hers dry for most of the day. I made them in noodle fashion and not dumplings, rolling the dough thin makes them less doughy and tough

Perhaps being from the north is the reason I don't like this recipe. I tried it because it seems really easy and from scratch, but neither my husband nor me liked it. We grew up with dumplings being light and fluffy. These dumplings are heavy and tastless. Maybe I didn't let them dry enough. How dry do they have to be? I wonder if adding baking powder would help them rise.Would this give them the fluffy texture and help them to take on the flavor of the stew? If anyone tries it, please post the results.

These are the same dumplings I grew up on at Baptist potluck dinners.  It was a total taste from my childhood.  I've tried a ton of different dumpling recipes and could never get just the right texture.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. It was easy to make and tasted wonderful. I added chopped parsley and they turned out great. I always make extra and freeze them to drop in any stew or soup I make. Even my picky 17 year old love them. Thanks so much!

Just like my grandmother made! I made these dumplings for my family and they were a hit! 
 I have been searching for a recipe to make dumplings like my grandmother made when I was a child growing up in rural Arkansas, and I finally found it. Letting the dough sit for a couple of hours before boiling is very important for texture if you want firm noodles. 
Thanks again for a great recipe!
You have my eternal gratitude for this recipe!!

THE BEST way to make dumplings. I was looking for one like Grandma would make and I found it. I read some other reviews and those that said it was lacking here or there have it all wrong. It is perfect the way it is. I love to cook OLD FASHION STYLE and do all my cooking from scratch and homemade, and this is as good as it gets with down home goodness. I even used fresh from the farm milk in this recipe. Not the milk you buy at your local grocers. I can NOT recommend this recipe HIGH enough 5 stars are too few.

This is one of the best recipes!  Very versatile!  You can add it to the broth of a roast chicken for a quick and easy family favorite or you can play with it.  
My favorite way to use it so far was to make Lasagna with it.  I just replaced the dumplings for the noodles.  The only thing to watch for is that the "noodles" will puff up some when cooking.

Great recipe for Dumplings.  I rolled the dough out thin and cut into small rectangles. I followed the advice of another reviewer and let them sit out for about 4-5 hours before cooking.  They plumped up to the perfect size and were not gooy at all.  (I used these to make Chicken and Dumplings in a slow cooker)

This is as close a recipe as I could find (I've searched quite a bit) for the deliciously chewy drop dumplings my mother used to make for her chicken stew. I did experiment with folding different things into separated portions. (e.g. cheese, onion, parsley) with mixed results.

I was looking for a dense dumpling recipe and while these were dense, they tasted very doughy to me like it had too much flour or maybe I did not roll it right. I made the dumplings, not the noodles. I boiled them in chicken broth for about 10 minutes. They all floated to the top and looked great, but like I said, tasted 'floury'. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did take the advice of one reviewer and placed the dumplings in boiling water right after cutting. Maybe I should have let the dumplings dry too. Not sure. Had I made the noodles, I would have let those dry as recommended.

Pretty basic recipe. A little like homemade noodles. I made the dumplings, cooked them in broth, then drained and fried in a little butter and seasoning salt. Then I added them to the soup. Very good.

I have been making these for years.  My mother showed me how when  i was young.  This is the "comfort food" at my house.  I triple the batch and use it in chicken/turkey soup and have enough for 4 or 5 dinners (3 of us) and my daughter comes and snatches some for her dinners too.  they are so fast and easy.  Thank you for posting this!!!  With Thanksgiving coming, i will make "leftover turkey noodle soup"!!! AWESOME!!!

These dumplings were awesome! I put some spices in the dough: curry powder, ground cumin, and ground coriander seed. I cooked them in a soup that used one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup (and instead of water to dilute the soup, I used chicken broth) and about a 1/3 cup of milk. I changed the recipe to only make four servings. It was amazing!

I have 4 children and a husband that is a very good cook... we like things that are simple and to the point - These were great!! The kids loved to help and make their own noodle shapes and dumpling hearts.  Thanks so much.

I have made these for years just the way my mother made them when I was little, the only difference is the name. Mom was Pennsylvania Dutch and these were called Bott Boi (buys) as it was pronounced) or slippery noodles. I add dried parsley in with the flour and use some of the chicken broth to make the noodles. I give these a 5 rating

This is almost the exact recipe my baba used to make dumplings for my dad.  Now that she's gone, I can make them for him.  If I want to make them healthier I use whole grain flour, and I can add in spices like garlic and even some chopped spinach.

This is how I learned to make Chicken Pot pie.  We cut it in squares and dropped it in chicken and broth with sliced potatoes.  Is a classic.  So great on a cold winter night.

This was great!!  I'm from Ohio, and my grandmother made dumplings, but never wrote down a recipe. This is it!!  Perfect.  The first time I made them I forgot to dry them, but they turned out great anyway!  Wonderful, and great reheated, even after being frozen.  A great meal extender, too.

These are good.. more like noodles as opposed to my normal dumpling recipe. I picked this recipe due to the fact there is no fat in it. I changed it to 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg and added a bit of baking powder. I rolled them super then. The kids still enjoyed them.. I will use again for my chicken noodle soup... not my chicken and dumplings:)

This is my first time making noodles. The recipe is very easy to work with and to roll out. I followed the recipe as is. I divided the dough into four sections. The first batch I rolled out very thin. The last batch I rolled out to a quarter inch thickness. That one was my favorite. Thick enough that the noodles did not fall apart. So on that note I am off to make my second batch for dinner tomorrow. I didn't let the noodles dry like the recipe said to. But the noodles came out just fine.

This is the exact recipe that my mother (born 1913)used, handed down from her mother, and handed down to me.  I have eaten other dumplings but never like them as well as this recipe.  Never tried making noodles or air drying them before cooking.

My Great grandma would make these dumplings too. For the broth it would be water, kidney beans with bacon grease.  It sounds gross but it is very good.  My Great grandpa and I would pick out the beans. We didn't like the beans but I like the flavor they give the broth.  Yummy  Good childhood memories.

Love this recipe!  I too made the broth while the dumplings dried and put the cooked chicken back in last after the dumplings were done.  The person that served this with biscuits and mashed potatoes must love carbs. They should have cooked some bread to sop it up with too.

Actually keep this recipe a little more moist and drop by spoonful into broth.  They taste just like my great grandma's dumplings.  She was from the old country (Lithuania) and her home made soups were the best!  She isn't here anymore and these bring back some amazing memories.

I grew up eating fluffy drop dumplings while my hubby grew up with the flat rolled out kind.  I have tried many times to mimick my mominlaws dumpling with no success, until today!  And in fact, my 8 yr old says she likes mine better than granny's!  I can't ask for more than that can I?

Awesome recipe!! I too cut the recipe in half. Now I wish I wouldnt have. I had a ham bone left over from my Christmas dinner. I made a great bean soup with it added carrots, onion, celery, and pintos to the broth. I then boiled the dumplings for about 8-10 minutes in the soup. My pickiest son ate two helpings. I remember my mom making these with her fried cabbage and onions as a child. Yummy memories.

Great dumpling recipe. Next time think I will leave the egg out and make the dumplings thinner. This recipe is as close to Mom's recipe as possible.Mom cooked without recipes.It took a long time to figure out pie crusts. Great home style dumplings.

I thought these dumplings were just okay. I was actually looking for an alternative for my usual dumplings made with baking powder because I was all out of it. I tried this instead, but they were a bit to dense and chewy for my liking.

Very Good!  It's hard to find a recipe for rolled and cut  (noodle style) dumplings like my Southern Illinois grandmother made.  This is very similar to hers so I had to try it and was not disappointed.  Although I remember her taking 1 cup of her finished broth from the pot and tempering the egg in it before adding to the flour.  Because the broth added liquid, she may have used less milk but my mother says she did add some PET evaporated milk.  Also butter I think.  I'd love to find a recipe that used her method exactly because it was delicious! Oh, she put the flour in a pile directly on the countertop- no bowl- made a well in the middle and added the other ingredients into the well, mixing to the right consistency for her (not necessarily using all the flour).

Living in the south,  chicken and dumplings are on the list of "favorite foods" for a lot of people, including me. My grandmother made the best chicken and dumplings in the world, but I never learned to make her dumplings, and no written recipe for them ever existed. She just made them.  When my husband suggested that we make chicken and dumplings over the weekend, I found this recipe, and yesterday I made homemade dumplings for the first time, and they  turned out perfectly and were just what we wanted. They came together quickly - I mixed/kneaded by hand easily. The dough isn't sticky at all, and it has enough substance and elasticity to be rolled out very thin. I divided the dough in half prior to rolling for more control of thinness. Pulling with one hand/wrist and rolling in the opposite direction expedited the rolling process, and the dough was stretchy enough to not break. I finally have a go-to dumpling recipe and won't have to settle for those nasty frozen ones now! Thanks!! A+

My family did really like these dumplings...I liked that you had the option to make thick dumplings (like us) or like noodles like my Mom & Gma & G. Aunties.  Do not like dumplings that fall apart & unrecognizable.  Will use recipe again.

These are the best and simplest dumplings and everyone loves them. I grew up eating the big fluffy dumpling and when my husband and I got married I learned quick those weren’t dumplings in his very southern family lol! I tried tons of recipes until stumbling upon this one and hitting the nail on the head. I made them for his Grandmother when she was here visiting and the famous “family recipe” was her mother in laws my husbands great grandmas. She asked me if I had somehow gotten Mama Sue’s recipe because they were perfect! Everyone else I’ve made them for loves them to! They also freeze well layered on parchment paper and put in a gallon bag. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made these vegan with almond milk and egg replacer. Cooked them in faux chicken broth and they were amazing and every bit as good as chicken broth and dumplings. I will make these often.

I loved the recipe! I added baking powder, a stick of soft butter and black pepper.  A great addition to my boiled chicken and homemade broth.

My hubby says they're good, almost like the ones his grandmother made. Made the noodles this time but going to try  the dumplings next time. My daughter and I are fans of the fluffy dumplings. I use the bisquik recipe but the always disappear in the broth. Thank you for sharing.

I made these exactly as the recipe called for.  I rolled them out into a big rectangle and cut with a pizza cutter.  I then added them to boiling broth.  I think I rolled them out thin enough, but they took over 1 1/2 hours to get even tender enough to bite into.  They were still very doughy and tough but we ate it.  I won't be making them again.

Followed the recipe exactly and came out great!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I had similar dumplings in a fish soup years ago while traveling and wondered how they were made.  Made dumplings to try in chicken soup I made today and they were great.   Also made noodles that are drying now to use later.  Definitely a keeper.

I have been making these for the last 4 years.  They turn out perfect every time!  I have never let them dry out.  I get the broth started and then start making the dumplings.  The broth is usually boiling and waiting for the dumplings to be added. I actually have some cooking right now!

I have made these several times. I did not have all purpose flour on one occasion I only had self rising, it works with the recipe, just a bit more difficult to get smooth dough for cutting, so make sure that all purpose flour is used for easier blending into dough. If you would like a more flavorful dumpling ( although recipe as written is wonderful and now the go to recipe I use for dumpling) add the following to the flour 2 teaspoons of oregano, 2 teaspoons of seasoned salt (omit regular salt) 2 teaspoons of tyme, 2 teaspoons of tyme, and 2 teaspoons of Rosemary leaves. This makes for a tasty version of the dumplings, although I love the as written recipe too, just like to add a twist from time to time.

For a first time noodle/dumpling maker, these came out better than I thought they would. I was a little apprehensive when mixing the dough because it was very sticky and I was tempted to add more flour, but didn't assuming that it would pick up enough during the kneading and rolling out process. I've never been good with rolling out doughs, so that was a little challenging.I was looking for a noodle like Mrs. Reames; dense but tender. These came out better!They had that nice "Al Dente" texture while still being light to eat. I used half of the dough in a Chicken and Dumpling dish the first night, cutting them into noodles and letting them dry for a couple of hours. With the remaining dough, I rolled it out into thin sheets and planned on making filled pasta with it the next day until I got a cabbage and onion inspiration. I caramelized a large sweet onion, with a half of a head of cabbage and some small-diced ham. The sheets I cut into squares and simmered them untill they were almost done and then drained them and mixed them into the cabbage mix with butter, pepper and a splash of chicken broth. Rolling them out thin gives them a silkier texture while still retaining the firmness. Both preparations got rave reviews from me and my husband. Now all I have to do is work on my mixing and rolling skills, but I will be making these often enough that I should be a pro at it in no time!In fact, I'm making another batch today that I think I'll freeze. Great recipe, Barb, thank you!

This is the same recipe that has been handed down in our family for generations.  The only difference is my mother added a teaspoon of baking powder to make them lighter.  We called this Pot Pie and used chicken, pork, beef or a mixture for the soup. It has always been family favorite and made a few times a month.  We have always cut these into about 1 1/2 in squares.

My mother also cooked a whole chicken for this and took the chicken out of the pot before she added the dumplings, deboned it and browned it in a fry pan with a little butter then served it on top of the soup -- soooo good!

I am 64 and have been making dumplings like this forever. This was my grandmother's recipe she learned from her mother. They are by far the best. I also take a leftover ham bone, boil the bits of ham off, add potatoes, a bit more ham and these dumplings. This too is a wonderful dish on a cold winter night. Let me know if anyone tries the ham recipe. I would like to know how you like it.

This is the almost same recipe I have used all my life.  It is an Amish recipe  and my family begs for it.  Living in Western, NY where it is so cold and snowy, it is on our menu a LOT.  Sometimes I use milk and sometimes just water.....regardless...yum! Have to use Lactose free milk, so if I am out or it is not on my budget for the week.....water it is!  Try it!

I had most of a whole roast chicken left over from the night before, so I decided to make chicken and dumplings like grandma used to make.  I added the deboned chicked to the stock pot along with some chopped onion and celery.  I added some salt and pepper, ssge and marjoram for seasoning and let the stock simmer.  When the time came to make the dumplins, I went to the pantry to get the flour only to discover that I was totally out of all purpose flour!  I did have nealry 15 pounds of bread flour though.  I decided to use the bread flour anyway. The whole time I was thinking to myself this is NOT going to work.  I mixed up the dough and kneaded it for a few minutes and then rolled it out to about 1/8 inch thick and cut into dumplings.  It was hard work getting that tough dough rolled out!  My bread flour dumplings took quite a bit longer than usual to cook and become tender, but to my surprise they turned out just fine!  Very much like I remember my grandmothers dumplings being.  Sometimes a goof just works out.  Next time I think I'll try them with all purpose flour just to see though.  Thanks for the recipe!
