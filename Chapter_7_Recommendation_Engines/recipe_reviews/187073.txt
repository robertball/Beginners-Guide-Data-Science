This is a really good idea for appetizers that are quick and easy to prepare, and pretty tasty, too. However, I found using mini-muffin cups as a mold problematic.  Just a little bit of filling fills them right up, and then during baking the pastry puffed up and a bunch of the filling spilled out.  I had better results using regular sized muffin cups:  I was able to put more filling in, and still leave them half empty to account for the expansion.  Definitely try out other flavorings, too, like cheddar and bacon!

I took the advice of another reviewer and made these in a regular-size muffin pan.  They came out like perfect little mini-quiches. Delicious - and so easy and fast to put together.

I used this concept for butternut squash, caramelized onion, and crispy sage - Love it and will use it again with other fillings.  While I didn't make the exact recipe here, I love the concept of mini quiche with the crescent dough.  Very easy to do!
