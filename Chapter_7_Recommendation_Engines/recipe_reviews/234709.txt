Heavenly!  I did have to use a gluten free flour blend since I baked these for a gluten-free friend but they turned out AMAZING!  The combination if gingerbread and pear is divine.  I'll make these again and again throughout the holiday season--GF and regular!!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I love, love, love these muffins! They are so good with a cup of hot chocolate on a cold morning. They are moist and sweet, but not too sweet. They are the perfect sweetness. The combination of spices are perfect. I don't eat eggs, so I used my regular egg-substitute, which is one Tablespoon flax seed (ground) mixed with three Tablespoons of water for each egg.  I didn't have any buttermilk and didn't feel like running to the store at 7:00 a.m., so I used almond milk instead. I didn't have enough molasses to make 3/4 cup, so I used what I had, which was 1/2 cup. And the only other thing I changed was I used two pears instead of one because I had two left and wanted to use them both before they got too ripe and had to throw them away. (I hate to waste food.) I was a little nervous that maybe both pears would be too much, but it was just right. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I will be making these muffins often.

These rose well, got 9 muffins out of it, did not peel pears, so you wld. get a bit of a crunch, but i like the feel of the peel.

Left out sugar, as pears make it sweet enough, wld. add more spice then what they call for as a bit bland, but all in all a keeper.

I love these muffins. I have a pear tree and make these every year when I have bunches to use up. I usually add more than 1 pear, probably 2 and pecans also. Recipe takes no time at all to whip up and they always come out nice.

Wow, these were so good. I didn't have wheat pastry flour but used 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 cake, also two small pears because one didn't seem to be enough. A wonderful combination of spices that's not too sweet.

These were wonderful.  I used 2 pears because just 1 for this many muffins didn't seem like enough.  Next time I would use 3 pears.  Great recipe!

These are awesome! I could not find whole wheat pastry flour at our market, so I used 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 cake flour. I made  1 1/2 size batch, using 3 shredded pears, but I kept the spice ratio the same as written. I also did not have white sugar, so I used brown sugar. Maybe with the whole wheat flour it could need extra spices (as some other reviewers had suggested) , but we thought they had plenty of aroma and gingerbread flavor. I minced up some candied ginger and sprinkled it on top before baking. We made 2 dozen, and 8 were devoured while they were still warm. They are great next day, with some apricot jam, and they taste fresh from the oven after 15-30 seconds on low power in the microwave!!

Omg, these are perfect Fall muffins! I used 3 pears, dark brown sugar in place of white, and added more spices. I also got 23 muffins, and they baked perfectly in 18 minutes. Using 3 pears gives it a wonderful balance flavors between the molasses, the spices, and the pears. And they get better the next day too! Will definitely make these again! Thank you!

This an absolutely delectable muffin.  I love the little bit of heat coming from the ginger and the sweetness of the pear.  I made exactly as written.  I personally don't think gingerbread should be confined to the holidays, so I made them in June.  I could have eaten them all myself but shared instead.

I used all AP flour since that is what I had on hand. I upped the pears to 1.5 per other comments. I also used 2% milk instead of buttermilk only b/c the grocery store only had buttermilk in 1/2-gallon jugs and I didn't need or want that much. This combination yielded 6 large muffins and 10 small.

Made it twice ... first time with diced honey crisp apple, second time with large Bartlett Pear.  This is definitely for folks that like gingerbread! Will make this again.

Lots of changes, as suggested by reviews. Doubled the spices, 1.5 large pears, subbed in half whole wheat flour and half AP flour, dark brown sugar. Made 12 regular and 6 mini-muffins. Very good as gingerbread, but didn't get as much pear flavor as I hoped for (maybe doubling the spices overwhelmed the pear flavor?)

I found this when I was looking for ways to use up some extra buttermilk.  These are good, and certainly healthier than other muffin recipes.  I think I'll add a little bit more of the spices and a second pear next time around.  Also, maybe my muffin tins are a little small, but this made around 16 muffins for me.  Definitely plan to make these again!

The first day I had made these I wasn't sure if I liked them. The 2nd day it tasted much better (I think cause the pears got softer). They taste like gingerbread in muffin form. They also freeze well

I followed some other people's advice . I doubled the spice amounts (except the salt) , used 3 pears and as I only had white flour, I added a handful of ground flax seeds. I also added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. They were nice and moist and delicious. A great new recipe to use the pears on our tree. Will make over and over again

These were a nice change, moist and flavourfull muffins. I used Robin Hood Whole Wheat and Flax flour,  added an additional 3/4 cups of flour as the batter was too wet, added vanilla, used 3 pears that needed to be eaten, yielded 16 muffins that rose very high and baked in 20 minutes.

This is a great recipe! Moist and very flavorful. I really like the pieces of pear in it. If I make it again I think I would put 2 pears in instead of 1, just to get more of those little pear chunks in each muffin. All in all this recipe was very tasty though ??

These were good. Based on other reviews I doubled the pear, and used heaping measurements when it came to the spices. In addition I added some nutmeg and a big splash of vanilla. I got 18 muffins.. And baked mine at 350 for exactly 20 minutes. I suggest maybe using more of a harder pear or one that hasn't ripened as much so it doesn't get lost in the muffin. I topped some of mine with some sliced almonds before baking. I really enjoyed the contrast of texture that the almonds brought to the cooked Pears.

Very good. I increased spices and added more pear.  Even though the pear is cut up in chunks, it seems to dissolve into the batter - no chunks were apparent in the baked muffin. And couldn't really taste the pear, even with extra added, but I will make these muffins again. I like being able to include fresh fruit in my baking.

Made with whole wheat flour, egg whites, skim milk with lemon juice for buttermilk, applesauce for oil, and date sugar for sugar.  Topped with raw sugar and ezekiel cereal for crunch.  Great, even with modifications!  Made as mini muffins, and took 15 minutes to bake.

Moist and easy.  I made some modifications (subbing some oatmeal for part of the flour, using corn flour, and baking in small loaf pans), so it was necessary to bake a little longer, but still, very good.

Easy to make and wonderful gingerbread flavour. I substituted the flour with Cloud 9 gluten free baking mix and almond milk curdled with vinegar to replace the buttermilk. Wonderful, definitely making again!
