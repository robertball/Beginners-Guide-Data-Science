This was soo good and soo easy!  I omitted the pasta and carrots to cut down on carbs and it was just as good.  For me, it was a cross between a soup, stew, and chili.  Very tasty!!

This was really thick and hearty.  Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used 14.5 oz cans of beef broth, and 2/3 cup of noodles.  Also, put some shredded cheddar on top of each bowl.  I loved this soup- my 2 year old ate a whole bowl.  You can freeze this also.

This was really awesome! The sugar in it just gives it a touch of sweetness.  Even if you don't like (or think you don't) eggplant, try it.  There's not an eggplant flavor and it's great!  My husband's not a big eggplant fan, but he loved it, too.  By the way, he's the one that made it, so it had to be easy and he followed the recipe exactly.

Oh wow.  This is one of THE best eggplant recipes I've ever tried and SO EASY!  I've halved the ground beef or used ground turkey or sausage with great results.  I've also added diced zuchini, squash and extra macaroni, yum.  Very hearty and nobody will suspect it has eggplant!  I've served it several times for company and always get compliments and requests for the recipe.  Thanks!!!

I have been trying different eggplant recipes to use up the excess from the garden and this was by far the favorite.  My family of 7 loved it; there was plenty plus leftovers.  I used what I had on hand so I had several substitutes: I added some zucchini (1c.) and green beans (3/4c) and left out the celery; increased macaroni to 1 cup.  Also I did not have Italian tomatoes so I used 6 medium tomatoes + 2 tsp. Italian seasoning +1/4 tsp. cumin.  I used 6c. water + 3 tsp. beef bullion granules + 8 oz. tomato sauce in place of beef broth.  I think would turn out great no matter what veggies you throw in!

DELICIOUS!  Follow recipe exactly (which I usually don't do) and it turned out perfect!  Also, leftovers freeze extremely well.

This was so nice and hearty... used ground turkey instead of beef, and chicken stock instead of beef stock. I was going to omit the noodles altogether, but at the last minute i threw in some whole-wheat cous cous. fantastic!

Excellent recipe!  I added a red bell pepper, used whole grain small elbow macaroni, omitted the parsley, did not drain the tomatos and added some red pepper flakes.  This is a great base for adding all kinds of vegetables.  I think it would be great to add a can or red kidney beans since the texture is very much like chili.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband normally has not much to say, but he liked this one a lot.  I loved it.  A keeper for sure.  I changed it to turkey and had one can of  beef broth and one of turkey.  Used small noodles (the little tiny tube kind) and it was great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and kids loved this dish and they don't always request that I repeat new recipes that I've tried.  This one will definitely be added to our favorites.  It is also a very cheap dish to make with most ingredients already on hand.

This soup is very good but makes a lot.  I halved the recipe and I still have plenty of servings.  I had to improvise with the broth, as I didn't have canned broth.  I used ground turkey and chicken buillon instead (3 cubes with 3 cups).   It still came out very thick--if you like your soup more liquid, you may want to add more broth.

Very nice, hearty recipe. To me, it mimicked a ratatouille style dish, probably because of the Italian seasoning in the tomatoes. Still delicious, and a great way to use up eggplants. I threw the ingredients into the crock pot in the AM, and let it simmer on low all day. Definitely got better the second day.

Super soup! I loved it. Very easy, quick and cheap. I did make a few little changes to what I had on hand. A great recipe will always allow for variations. I did not have parsley so I used a little dried basil and oregano. I also used what ever noddles I had (big whole wheat elbows). I used chicken broth and added a dash or Worcestershire sauce. Very hearty on a cold night. Thanks!

This was FABULOUS! I am not a fan of eggplant but this was seriously one of the yummiest dishes I have evver made. I used organic ground beef and cooked it early in the day. Popped it in the fridge and then took it out later in the day to reheat. I think the flavours intensified because of the time. Added grated romano cheese on top before serving and it was a hit, even with my two year old. I will be definately making this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe with a couple modifications. I omitted the macaroni and used splenda instead. I also used plain diced tomatoes and used my own italian seasoning mix. I used about a teaspoon of that seasoning. I also had to double the salt and added one tablespoon thyme. 

I let it simmer for about 30 minutes and it was AMAZING!

We had to make it vegitarian for my daughter so I substituted Morning Star Crumbles for the meat and used vegetable broth.   Added mushroom that I needed to use and also substituted Quick Cooking Barley for the pasta.  Easy & excellent!   We all enjoyed it!!!

Made exactly at posted at it was fantastic! I imagine even non-eggplant lovers will like this because you don't really "taste" the eggplant.

Surprisingly, i did not change anything about this recipe (i am usually very tempted, and always give in to the temptation), but here I only substituted bouillon for the broth and added italian herbs to plain canned tomatoes...  VERY VERY GOOD RECIPE

Tasty but nothing special. The eggplant is hardly discernible. Needs more spices. I used a little less beef broth because I ran out, so it was more like stew than soup. I am giving an extra star because I left off the garnishes, which probably would've helped boost the flavor.

Ok, I made some adjustments, and it turned out fabulous! Instead of the ground beef, I added ground turkey.  Also, I added sausage (browned first in the pan, and set aside and sliced and re-added later on). I used slightly more diced tomato, and slightly more broth (due to the increase in meat). Also, I added multigrain macaroni noodles instead of plain ones. More health conscious I'm sure! Made it for my man, and he has been eating it for days! :)

I started making this meal but my hubby finished it while I took a child to the emergency room.  Poor guy, I failed to mention that I prefer eggplant without the skin.  The skin was too chewy...Soup is never as nice when you need to pick out an ingredient,  The broth was really tasty.  However, the kids only ate a small bowl and hubby commented that the cheese saved it.  I won't fix this again.

Wow, loved it, and it's a perfect family favorite meal that's also healthy and doesn't take too long to make! Will definitely add this to our list of regulars. I did 2-3x the amount of macaroni to make it a complete meal.

Yum! I omitted the macaroni but the stew is fantastic. If you don't have Italian-flavored diced tomatoes, add 1 tbs of Italian seasoning instead.

Delicious! Altered it to follow the paleo diet by omitting cheese, sugar and macaroni. Great way to use up extra eggplant. Didn't have canned tomatoes so used regular tomatoes and added a tablespoon of tomato paste and italian seasoning. Added 2 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and water in place of beef stock. Added a green pepper and some seasoning peppers (caribbean). YUM!

This is the second time I made this soup.  I used three small to medium eggplants, chopped into small cubes.  Also added spinach, heirloom carrots, zuchinni, and home canned tomatoes.
Added maybe 1/4 more of macaroni to this soup too.
When it was done I used an immersion blender to puree this soup so it resembled more of a cream type soup.
Made it much easier to pass off many of the veggies on my husband.
He actually ate one cup of soup and said it was good.
Filling, tasty, and a great way to use up some extra veggies you might have on hand.

Delicious.  I didn't  drain the tomatoes and cooked the carrots and noodles separate from the soup (but together with each other) to acoomodate my low-carb husband.  The rest of us just added the noodles and carrots to our bowls with the rest of the soup.  The kids did not even question the eggplant.  A complete hit.

I made this as is, and for me -- it was delicious! As for my friend (who is kind of picky w/ her food) didn't care for it too much. She told me, "it was an aquired taste". I thought the flavors complimented one another nicely. I will make this again.

Delicious!! I substituted sweet Italian sausage for the ground beef to add to the sweet flavor this soup offers. It turned out delicious! Happy bellies = happy mommy!!

My daughter used to make this as written and then with turkey. Now we use Quorn Grounds and vegetable stock. You may need to add a little more oil/water to prevent sticking dring the browning stage. Just had a steaming bowl with garlic bread!

I was looking for a way to use up some of the eggplant we have in our garden and found this gem.  I really enjoyed this soup.  I did leave out the celery (didn't have any) and substituted fresh garden tomatoes for the canned (added some italian seasoning).  I would definitely make this again.

This was a perfect quick dinner. I had an eggplant I didn't know what to do with and an extra pound of ground beef. Everything else is staple pantry ingredients. I cooked it longer than the 15 minutes, so the flavors could meld a bit more. My husband loved it.

I bought an eggplant today and didn't know what to do with this, so I made this recipe and it was excellent! The only things I did differently, since I didn't want to go back to the store, was I used beef buillon for the broth, and then I decided to add a bit more tomato. The spices really made the broth taste great. This is one I'll use again.

The only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars is the fact I made some changes to make it vegetarian. I used vegetable broth in place of the beef broth and kidney beans instead of meat.  I used a multigrain pasta as well. I LOVED it. Next time I will experiment with different veggies. The nutmeg adds a wonderful flavor.

I never eat eggplant so I was a little nervous about trying this recipe. It turned out great and makes a great light dinner. I  omitted the oil, used lean ground beef and multi grain pasta to make it a bit healthier. Also I added an extra 1/4 cup of beef broth to make it soupier. We will make this again and again...

Really yummy & hearty.  Could use more broth and I added more macaroni than recipe calls for.  I ate the leftovers from this soup for 2 days and it just got better and better!  Save a few steps (and some chopping) and buy frozen, pre-cut mix of onion, carrot and celery.

Marvelous. I used more carrot & celery, onion & garlic, degorged the eggplant before cooking, and based on other reviews used more stock, and an additional tin of diced tomatoes. I used orzo for the pasta. And with lean ground beef did not have to drain any grease. This makes a lot of stew (not soup!)and freezes/re-heats beautifully. Enjoy!

I liked this recipe. It is an interesting way to get lots of veggies. I had a bunch of eggplant from a farmer's market and didn't know what to do, so I made this. I ended up doubling the recipe because I had so much eggplant. That was a mistake because it was too difficult to cook it all together since I didn't have a large enough pot. So I put half in a crock pot after the beef was cooked and the other half I left on the stove top. In the end it turned out alright. I doubled the amount of macaroni called for by the recipe (so I quadrupled it since I doubled the recipe). I used the little Ditali macaroni noodles because they are small and I think they work well for soups. I spice up my bowl by adding some Louisiana Crystal hot sauce or Tabasco. The one downside to this recipe is that eggplant is a little bit difficult for my stomach in large quantities, but that's probably because I don't have it as often as I should!

This was delicious!  Even my picky 3-year old, who gags on most veggies, gobbled this up & asked for seconds!!  I used ground turkey & chicken broth instead of the beef, and omitted the celery since I had none on hand. I think zucchini or another squash could be subbed for the eggplant with equally good results.  Next time, I will add some beans to the recipe for a heartier result...there will definitely be a next time!

My husband does not like soup or eggplant that much but we both loved this!! It was easy to make and very hardy. I served it with warm herb artisan bread for dipping. Thankfully there's lots of leftovers for later this week!

This was a very good soup using something that I rarely cook with, eggplant.  Husband and I really liked it but the kids (5 and 7) haven't tried it yet so I hope it is a win for us all.

I found this recipe in 1973 and it became a family staple.  We ate it so much our three boys each said they were glad to leave home because they no longer had to eat eggplant supper soup for days on end.  I got a little carried away I liked it so much.

Great soup!!! I used olive oil to brown the meat instead of vegetable oil, and omitted the macaroni and carrots to make it low carb. Unfortunately, when I went to drain the meat I accidentally dropped the lid and half of my meat fell down the sink!!! Bummer!!! Even with that unfortunate mishap, this dish was great!!! Husband said it is worth a repeat! I would have to agree! I'm sure it will be just as good with all the of the meat in it! Haha! Will make again!

PERFECTO!
I didn't change the recipe. I thought why change it if it's working for others. As recommended by others, I added 1 sliced zucchinis, 1/2 cup uncooked rice and pepper flakes. I used 4 tomatoes because I was out of canned tomatoes. 
Results - DELICIOSO! 
I ate 4 bowls of soup! My neighbors and my husband devoured the soup. My 3 school age kids didn't eat much of it. I should have told them it's vegetable soup. I think the word "eggplant" threw them off the grid!

Very good - tastes yummy in my tummy on a cold Fall day!  Used ground turkey instead of beef.  Didn't drain the canned tomatoes, added more broth and threw in some extra veggies that needed to be used up.  Family friendly - makes enough to share!

Excellent recipe! Modified a bit--cut up sirloin steak instead of ground beef, and added fresh green beans, lima beans and a handful of various fresh herbs. Might try adding some corn next time, too. Great way to use garden veggies!

Very good flavor. An unusual flavor for my family, but delicious. My 1.5- & 3-year-olds ate it right up, as well as my I-don't-like-eggplant husband. I used water + 1 cube beef bouillion because I didn't have beef broth. Also didn't add salt. Also, didn't have canned tomatoes, just one diced Roma tomato.

This soup is so yummy.  I loved the soup and my 3 and 4 year old boys said it was their favorite.  It is nice to have some options with Eggplant.  I definately plan on having this again.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and curley noodles instead of macaroni.  Thanks for a wonderful soup.  I really enjoyed it.

A nice and DIFFERENT way to use extra eggplant.  Not your usual eggplant parmesan or fried eggplant.  LOVED the broth from this soup.  Very soothing.

This was a great way to use up the odds and ends of our CSA box.  We had almost everything on hand and just threw it together.  So yummy!

I followed the recipe almost exact, but I used ground turkey instead of beef and the smallest tubes of macaroni I could find, also added yellow squash.  I'd have to say it was lacking in spices.  Overall it tasted like a bland but tomatoey vegetable soup. Mostly, it really lacked that spicy hint of flavorful seasonings that I look for in a recipe. It was still good but nothing special.

This was delicious.  I had some leftover eggplant and wanted to use it up.  My husband doesn't even particularly like eggplant either and was not thrilled about what we were having for dinner.  He loved it.  It reminded him of a combination of french onion soup and a beef stew.   I didn't use any pasta and because I'm vegetarian I use Morning Star fake beef crumbles and vegetarian broth. It was really really really good.  You couldn't even taste the eggplant but there was quite a bit.  This is truly a delicious and nutritious meal. I think it was the nutmeg that made this such a unique dish.  Whatever it is, it's fantastic...

Very good recipe, especially as a base where you can play with the ingredients to your taste.  I made it lower carb by ommitting the sugar and pasta, but increased the meat a bit and added fresh diced zucchini and yellow sqaush.  I set the meat aside and sauteed the onions and veggies a bit before combining the rest of the ingredients.  I added a few extra spices (oregano, basil, paprika), I used chicken broth instead of beef, and I also let the soup simmer for 30 minutes before eating.  Delish.  Great simple recipe that I just found myself digging around the fridge wondering what else might go great with it.

I would give this three and a half stars if I could, but since I can't...The soup improved as it sat in the fridge, which it did for days because neither my husband nor I was impressed.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good.  I rarely follow recipes exactly and this time I did, all the ingredients were fresh, and it still was just so-so.

I LOVED this recipe, and so did my aunt, brother and parents (I loved it so much I sent it to all of them).  The only thing I would do differently is I would NOT peel the eggplant.  Also, my aunt made it without any ground beef and it was still good.  I use chicken broth and ground turkey in mine!!!  A fantastic dinner!!!

My husband and 11 year old daughter loved the soup. Thank you for a great alternative to use eggplant. We used diced tomatoes and added Italian seasoning with dried parsley and it tastes great!  Thanks again!

Being from Indian origin, I found the soup to be a little bland. So I added about 1/4 tsp cumin to 4 servings. It was delicious. I was craving chili but didn't want beans. This soup hit the spot.

The next day - More amazing. Wow.

This was a perfect recipe for an autumn lunch.  Easy to prepare, healthy, and delicious.  The only change I made was to add 3/4 cup of spelt rotini in place of the noodles called for in the original recipe.  This will definitely be going into my favorite recipe binder :)

This was the first time I have ever had eggplant and I love it!  My children (ages 3-6) loved this soup.  Instead of using Italian tomatoes I used a 28oz can of plain diced tomatoes and added some italian seasoning. I'll be making this again and again.
Thanks for a great recipe

This was great! The recipe calls for just the right amount of nutmeg. I thought it needed more broth, though. But it tastes great, and I'm sure is very nutritous!

Been making this recipe for a while and we love it. My husband and stepson are super picky and normally won't eat vegetables but they love this soup. You can add ain't any vegetables you want or change up the seasonings. Also to make it a little healthier I've used ground turkey, ground pork or ground chicken all of them taste good

Great way to use up our eggplant harvest this year. I loved the ease of this recipe and used almost everything out of our own garden. This was really good on a cold rainy day. The only thing different I did was add fresh green beans. YUM!

Loved! I did tweek the recipe though. Didn't have the ground beef so I used Bob Evans regular sausage. I didn't have two cans of the Italian tomatoes , so used one can and one can of fire roasted tomatoes . Didn't measure eggplant I just diced and put whole thing. It isn't only 12 min to heat up either . Takes longer than that to make sure carrots are cooked thru. I cooked in a heavy pot on simmer for about three hrs. Then added my cheese before serving. My husband doesn't really care for eggplant and was reluctant about tasting, but he did only because his co-worker gave him the eggplant. :) he really enjoyed it though. Great Fall soup!

I love eggplant and always look for more ways to use it. I'm trying to keep carbs low so I skipped the macaroni and sugar, but this is excellent! I've also experimented using ground turkey instead of beef and I think half turkey and half beef is a pretty good compromise.

This is a great, hearty soup.  I peeled the eggplant.  I made the noodles separately rather than in the soup itself.  Truly, I preferred the soup alone, without noodles.  I did add extra Italian seasonings -oregano and basil.  This is best the second, or third day.  The eggplant blends right in and you'd never think it was one of the components...  Really yummy!

Just delicious.  I too used ground italian seasoned turkey.  Had to run to the store so I could make another pot. My hubby and sister and I ate it all. The next batch I made I added an extra carton on stock so it would be a little more soupy. I also added some 21 salute from trader joes.  Next time I will add yellow bell peppers.  I also used shredded carrots looked really pretty!

Delicious flavor, will make again.  Suggest that you peel the eggplant and cut it up fairly small just because it looks better that way.

Delicious, cold-weather comfort food!!!  I replaced the macaroni with orzo pasta (that's what I had on hand) and it was really good.  Also, I ended up cooking the veggies with the meat for awhile before adding the broth & tomatoes and I think that was a good idea as it helped the veggies cook faster.  I served it to my folks who don't care for eggplant and they both liked it.  I think I might replace the pasta with some canned beans next time to cut carbs and add fiber.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Great recipe.  I cook it a couple of times a year - in summer when the eggplant are plentiful and in winter for a cold winter day.  I skip the macaroni because I have plenty leftover and don't like my pasta well done. It is a flexible recipe that stands modification so experiment away.

A delicious recipe. I opted to crock pot on high for three hours, and added 1/2 cup barley & 1/2 cup of wild rice too.

Some how I over cooked the eggplant. It was still good. It does make a hearty soup. I made it a couple days before warming it up during the week. Cooling the soup allowed me to skim off the fat before it warming up during the week.

Delicious! You only have to cook it 12 minutes and it tastes like it's been cooking for hours. I made it exactly as the recipe says. One small note - my pasta was a bit overcooked by the time the veggies were soft. Either cut the veggies super small or let the soup cook for a few minutes before adding pasta.

Delish! Really flavorful and an easy one pot dinner that will serve an army. I cooked it for probably 2-3 hours on low and didn't eat til the next day-my husband was a big fan. Would work great with ground turkey, sausage, shrimp, chicken...

This is incredibly delicious and so simple! My family loves dishes with lots of vegetables. We changed a couple of things. We used ground turkey instead of ground beef and green pepper in place of celery; I'm not a fan of cooked celery. Everything else, we kept the same. Awesome dish!

VERY good.  Followed the recipe exactly except:
-used plain canned tomatoes and just added lots of oregano, basil, and a dash of garlic powder. 
-used veggie penne instead of macaroni (had it on hand)
-used dried parsley instead of fresh (about 2 tsp)
-started with a stock pot and not a skillet since this clearly won't fit in a skillet.  Just sayin.

So I had to modify this a bit, but it turned out nicely.  I didn't have any canned tomatoes, but I had some butternut squash.   I ended up sautéing the squash a bit, then putting it in the blender to puree it.  That helped thicken the broth and my husband surprisingly loved it.  I thought he would not be able to handle all of the eggplant, but he actually liked it.  This will definitely make the repertoire for the winter!

Loved this soup I did not put any meat but put 1 yellow zuchinni, 2 bay leaves,  1 teas. basil/oregano and added 1/4 c. red pepper.  I did not use pasta but added 1/4 c brown rice.  Super healthy recipe and great flavor! Definite keeper.

Wow!  This is delicious!  I tripled the recipe for my family (there are 11 of us) and added some okra because I had it around and it needed to be used.  I omitted the beef completely and thought I might miss the flavor but I was SO wrong!  It is Fabulous without any meat.  I did add alittle chicken boullion to assist the flavor and I ground fresh nutmeg which was stronger but great.  There's lots of chopping involved  but with 5 of us it only took 15 minutes to prep and put into the pot.  Thanks for a great recipe!  We will be eating this regularly!

I made this for lunch. Again, Joline and I loved this. I omitted the pasta, used vegetable broth, and used a combination of ground chicken and seasoned baked tofu instead of beef. I also used San Marzano 28 oz can instead of 2 cans of diced tomatoes. It makes a difference for us...

I used ground chicken/chicken broth for the beef and also added zucchini.  I left out the pasta and didn't feel it was lacking.  Hearty veg soup.  The eggplant isn't noticeable for all you eggplant haters out there including my husband who really liked the soup.

I made this just as the recipe said, minus the nutmet (none on hand). This soup is really good! I had eggplant from my csa box and this has been the best way I have prepared the eggplant yet.. It made alot of soup and I shared with my neighbors who raved about it! I will be keeping this recipe.

I didn't have eggplant, so substituted cauliflower cut into smallish florets. It was delicious. When I later made it with eggplant, we both agreed that it was better with the cauliflower because of the added crispness of the vegetable. This recipe freezes well. so I always double it.

This is wonderful. I was able to make this soup into a low sodium dish by using no sodium beef broth, no salt added tomatoes and omitting the salt. This is a great choice for anyone on a low sodium diet.

Next time I'll add another 1/2 cup of pasta. Tasted even better the next day, but it was a great quick meal using eggplant!

My family loved this recipe. I used italian turkey sausage (out of the casing), 3 cans chicken broth and an entire eggplant.  I didn't have celery so I doubled the carrots.  I browned the sausage with the garlic, drained it and put it in the slow cooker. Then I just added everything into the pot and put it on low for the day. It is very similar to an Italian Caponata.  Served with big loaf of Vienna bread and tomato salad.

This recipe is totally awesome. I was down at my parents for the weekend. We had all this eggplant and was getting tired of eggplant parmesan. I got on all-recipes web site and did an ingredient search and came across the magnificent fare. It is everything that is says it is and much more. It is very filling and very addictive.

awesome soup! i made some changes by seasoning the beef first with salt, pepper, sugar and soy sauce. i cooked the garlic and onions first then browned the beef and left everything in the pan. i didn't have celery, but i did add mushrooms. when i added the broth, i also added more soy sauce. will definitely make this soup again.

To make a version with lower salt, fat and calories I didn't use beef stock or ground beef. I added Quorn vegetarian ground beef in the last ten minutes (it doesn't need to be cooked, just heated through.) Instead of the beef stock I used plain water. To add flavor I doubled the amount of garlic, onion, carrots and celery, added 1 tsp each of dried basil, marjoram, thyme, and a bay leaf (removed before serving.) I salted to taste with LoSalt to boost potassium.

I made this because I was given an eggplant from a garden and didn't know what to do with it.  This soup is SO delicious and healthy.  The flavors all mix together and make this a hearty meal.  You can barely notice the eggplant!

Followed exactly except for what I didn't have on hand.  Used ground elk, regular diced tomatoes (added 1/2 t. oregano and 1/2 t. basil to make up for it).  Only had 2 cans Campbell's beef broth which were 12oz. cans so I was short 4oz.  Put 1 cube beef bouillion in 4oz. water.  Maybe that was what made it a bit too salty.  That's the only thing I would change is cutting the salt to 1/2 t.  I haven't had a great experience with whole wheat pasta so I thought I'd use up some in here.  Didn't taste like cardboard at all!  With the whole recipe, felt like we were eating something really healthy.  Thanks!

i used one can low-sodium beef broth and one can vegetable broth.  instead of the carrots and celery, i used frozen veges.  also, i did not have parsley or parmesan.  nonetheless, my family really enjoyed this recipe.

This was an excellent recipe. I loved the idea of eggplant in soup but never thought it would work. I used veggie crumbs and vegetable bouillon rather then the beef and it was SO yummy. Other then that I did not change a thing and it was wonderful. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This soup was SO GOOD.  I followed the recipe exactly except I was a little short on the eggplant so I added just a little water to make up for it and also cooked the pasta most of the way separately so it wouldn't soak up too much liquid.  Tasted even better the second day!  Best part is, my kids loved it and didn't know they were eating eggplant!  Thanks!

This recipe was easy to make and was a delicious and hearty soup for a cool Fall evening.  My whole family enjoyed it and leftovers the next night were just as good! Definitely one of our favorites! I added a bit more pasta than required and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top for added flavor.

I had the thin japanese eggplants, so I scorched them over open flame until the skins were charred and easy to peel off. then i chopped up the flesh. i find they lend a smokier taste that way. In place of the beef, I also used some chopped up bacon.  all in all, pretty good. i'll be making this again :D

I like the fact that this soup is a little more unusual due to the eggplant ingredient.  I used petite diced regular tomatoes as I don't like big tomato chunks, added 3 can of 99% fat free beef broth (so it would be more of a soup than a stew), and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I decided to only add just a little nutmeg at the table to a small portion as I wasn't sure how I'd like it.  I'm glad I did, as I prefer the soup without the nutmeg better.  Also I decided to cook whole wheat small shells separately so they wouldn't get too mushy when reheated.  Another tip:  It tasted even better the next day as the flavors had time to meld.  YUM!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband grumbled while I was making it because he doesn't care for eggplant, but he had two overflowing bowlfuls! I brought the leftovers to work the next day and everyone wondered what smelled so good as I was re-heating it! Will definitely make again!

I made this and served it in the restaurant I work for.  All day I heard, "Eggplant soup??"  But those daring enough to try it said it was delicious!  I thought it was a really good soup too.  I will make it again, especially now with eggplant being plentiful in the garden.

Very tasty.  I added half a tub of tofu to increase the protein and both husband and 1 year old loved it.  It was a good way to use tofu as my husband normally hates it when I use tofu.

This was such an easy and delicious soup! Very hearty - great for chilly days. Slight alternations - I added about a half teaspoon of red chili flakes  to add a little spice; I used 2 tsp dried parsley instead of fresh; and increased to 1 cup noodles.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe! I'll be saving for the next time I'm craving eggplant. I used more carrots, and celery than the recipe called for, and I used one whole large eggplant, peeled and cubed, but I also used one whole carton of beef broth to make up for it. The nutmeg really made the beef flavor stand out. I used the recommended amount, but will increase it next time, if I have added more ingredients like I did this time. I also poured in about four tablespoons of olive oil, used egg noodles instead of macaroni, and omitted the Parmesan cheese. After all of that, the soup was still very satisfying and super delicious!

This is a yummy recipe. Hubby not crazy about eggplant, but he raved at this.  I did use "rotel" instead of plain tomatoes to add a little spicy flavor.  For those who thought it needed spice you might try that.  I just made it for the second time. Still yummy

I put in an extra cup of broth and the “soup” still soaked up all of the liquid in the pot. It turned out to be a chili type dish. The seasoning was very bland, even though I seasoned my meat with Montreal steak seasoning and I also seasoned the vegetables with seasoning salt. I won’t make this again.

Wife is vegetarian so we passed on the ground beef and used vegetable broth instead. Tasted great! will definitely make this again. The only change I would suggest is that the cheese was a little too stringy for us so we will experiment with other cheeses next time.

This was delicious!  The only changes I made was I used ground turkey rather than the beef for health reasons, added one additional garlic clove (personal preference) & did not drain the tomatoes, but used the entire can w/ the juices instead.  I also did not add any pasta as my husband has to watch his carb. intake.  He loved it so much that he wanted it for lunch and again for dinner!  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious and easy! My family loved it. We have made it several times now, once using zucchini when out of eggplant and another time using ground turkey instead of beef.  I always make a double batch and freeze some.

I made this a week ago.  I made it again this morning!  This soup was easy and totally delicious. Today, I tried using 1/2 summer squash and 1/2 eggplant.  I think I prefer it as written- with just eggplant.  It is hearty and fills you up.  The broth is delicious.  I am not sure, but I see myself making it a third time in the very near future.  Just let me finish this pan first!!

I was looking for something to do with eggplant given to us by a neighbor.  My family and I loved this soup!  I added a few more veggies than called for, including a zucchini, because we love them.  The nutmeg gave it a lovely, savory flavor and I have already made it a second time by request.  Love that it's low cal and healthy...just wish it didn't taste so great with bread. :-)

Fantastic, but I felt that it needed to be cooked more, so I cooked it for about an hour.  I brought it to a potluck lunch and everyone raved about it.

This was a great way to get my dad and brother to eat eggplant, an otherwise tough sell of a vegetable. Furthermore, it was a wonderful recipe in that it meant we didn't have to disguise the eggplant under mounds of cheese (i.e. eggplant parmesan) but could eat it as a healthful meal.

this was a hearty comforting delicious soup! I added many things that weren’t in the recipe, such as zucchini and bean sprouts.  I needed to add more beef broth in order to maintain being a “soup”.  I added more of the spices to compensate as well.  Next time I will add another can of diced tomatoes and more carrots.

I made exactly as stated but without the pasta. I used regular canned tomatoes and one Tbs of Italian seasoning because I didn’t have the Italian type.

I use ground turkey and chicken broth instead of beef. I also add 1/4 teas Tsardust Memories, a Penzey's spice with cinnamon and nutmeg and other ingredients. This is one of our favorite dishes. I cook it for at least on hour on low heat so the eggplant is soft. I also throw in more pasta.

Great basic soup! I did leave out the macaroni and subbed in some cooked brown rice and some green lentils. Both helped to thicken the soup and added good flavor/nutrition/fiber. I also only used about 1/3 of a pound of ground beef; probably could have left it out completely, since the lentils are a great protein source. Thanks for the recipe!

You can make this keto by omitting the noodles but if you do you should also half the ground beef.

I thought this was a good recipe at its base.  Nutmeg???  I put that in but had second thoughts.  That is what you use in breads, cakes, cookies.  Not a soup!!!!  I'll make it again use something different of NUTMEG!

Made with soy crumbles.  Used diced Italian tomatoes.  Used 2 Knorr boullion cubes instead of beef broth.  Added extra spices.  1,054 calories for the entire pot without pasta and parmesan.  6 servings for us.

I found the soup tasted better after the flavors had melded for a few hours. Used  fresh tomatoes but I didn't have enough so I used some home-made tomato sauce. Added 3/4c of sliced zucchini and 1/2 cup water. Used beef bouillon instead of the canned beef broth. Grated some home-made Monterey Jack cheese  on top. Very good soup.

I've made this soup many times in recent years and Love it.  My modifications:  When I make it, a full batch never gets eaten in one meal and find that the pasta becomes way over-cooked until mushy. Yuk. So I cook that separately then put pasta in ea. serving bowl and top with the hot soup; the pasta heats up quickly.  I tend to use 2 whole eggplants or as much as I can cram into my stockpot;  other veggie measurements I use as a guide but will add more of some things I really like such as garlic;  usually use low-sodium Italian diced tomatoes without draining and leave out the extra salt; use stevia instead of sugar;  prefer using veggie broth - I tried it once with real beef broth and did not like the flavor as much at all;      
My Most Favorite Version vegan;  use my favorite vegan "ground beef" and "No beef" beef broth cubes when I can find them, else same brand veggie broth cubes - then I really can eat the whole batch myself in one day.

I've passed recipe to friends, co-workers, & family. My sisters swear they don't like eggplant but IF they ever tried it they must have had a bad experience. Now going around them and giving samples to their husbands :o)

Wow was this a great soup.  I had my doubts but no more. This was a nice soup filled with lots of vegetables and meat. My husband loved it also.  He said it was the best soup I have made.  And we make a lot of soups.

This was delicious and so easy!  I didn't have celery or beef broth, and instead used cauliflower and chicken broth.  My husband claimed after the first bite that he'd definitely eat this again!

Delish! Halfed the tomatoes, cut out the sugar, and added some hot sauce, balsamic vinegar, and cumin. Great way to use up extra celery and carrots (and I always buy eggplants when I go to store). Cooked the macaroni separately, worried about it getting mushy when it goes into the fridge, but the macaroni is a good fit with this soup. Good taste, good mouth feel.

I've been making this soup a couple times a year for about 25-30 years, ever since my sister found this recipe in Sunset Magazine sometime in the 80s. It's one of my favorite comfort food recipes. The best tip I've learned over the years is that if you intend to save some for leftovers, cook the pasta separately, keep it in a separate container and heat and add it to the soup right before eating. If you cook the pasta with the soup it gets mushy when reheated as leftovers. Other tips: I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Have extra beef broth hand to add to the desired consistency. It comes out too chunky with the amount called for. For added flavor add a little butter to the olive oil before browning the meat. This soup is as good as leftovers as it is fresh and great for cold weather. It can also be made vegetarian by omitting the ground beef or substituting ground soy "meat" and using veggie broth instead of beef broth, although not as tasty for us carnivores.

Great recipe. I added a little vegetable bouillon for a little more flavor. I did make a few substitutions.. I don't like cooked carrots so I used an orange bell pepper instead. I also used egg noodles instead of macaroni and added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick.

this dish was excellent! the only ingredient i changed was the  diced tomatoes. i used some homemade marinara i had in the freezer.
i truly wasn't expecting this to be this good unless it was the sauce who added the awesome flavor.

Because we are going low carb, I left out the macaroni, and I didn't add the celery. Even without these ingredients, this is the best beef-vegetable soup I have ever eaten. My husband loved it too. I did add more minced garlic (we are garlic-lovers) and a bit more black pepper.

This has been a family favorite for several years - it has a wonderfully unique flavor and has  become a fall tradition. It is also wonderful as a vegetarian option. Half the time we make it including everything but the hamburger - it has a lighter, brighter flavor and is much loved! I was initially skeptical as I had never put nutmeg and sugar in a soup but it adds great flavor - it needs nothing other than the original recipe! We often don't add macaroni initially as we double the recipe to allow enough to freeze. It freezes well. We also tend to let it simmer longer than the recipe requires or use in a crockpot for several hours - but it isn't really necessary, we just like simmering soup! I really like this soup because it has a flavor twist on the traditional vegetable soup - but is still traditional enough that everyone likes it.  No one ever guesses it has eggplant!

This is a great recipe. I will try it next season, not only with eggplant, but with squash also.
I didn't add the pasta either.

Delicious! Definitely will make it again! Great for hiding eggplant, especially if you let cook long enough for it to break up. I added 2 large bay leaf, because my mom always used it in soup. I didn't have the whole allspice she also required for soup. I added some Tuscan spice since my tomatoes were not Italian style. I had some fresh spinach left, not nice enough for salad that I threw in after macaroni was ready

This definitely needed a little more flavor.  Added about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon each of red pepper flakes, cumin, and chili powder to the mix and it was much better.

Delicious! I'm not a fan of eggplant and I received one in my weekly farm basket.  I was convince that I wouldn't like this recipe and I would end up giving it away to the neighbors, but much to my surprise it was delicious. I did remove the skin from the eggplant and I added a little more spice to turn up the heat. I will make again if I ever end up with an eggplant that needs cooked.

Very good base recipe, easy and brilliant for eggplant. I didn't have fresh garlic, omitted the sugar and parsley and used regular canned diced tomatoes, garlic powder, season salt and chili powder to give it a little bit of a chili flare.

This is such a wonderful way too have eggplant. I tweeked the recipe a bit. I used Morning Star Farm Griller Crumbles (one 12oz package). I did not use the nutmeg because I didn't have any, but will try it next time. I used both fresh garlic and added some powdered as well as some cayenne pepper. The amount of pasta is perfect. Just enough to add texture. I will definitely be making this again. One of my new favorites. ???

After I browned the beef, garlic, and onion I threw everything in my slow cooker and cooked on low all day while I was at work. I added some more veggies (cabbage, zucchini, and yellow squash) and added cumin, bay leaves, and a banana pepper for more flavor per reviews.  I had some leftover cooked pasta in the fridge and I added that at the end. Very good and versatile to use whatever fresh veggies you have to use up. I agree with the reviewers that the eggplant is very camouflaged for those who aren't fans.

this was pretty good with some modifications.. i cut this down to 4 servings.. halved the onion.. used some leftover curried turkey burgers that i chopped up for the ground beef.. doubled the garlic.. subbed zucchini for the eggplant.. used frozen carrots.. didn't drain the tomatoes.. used beef bouillon.. left out the sugar.. subbed garlic salt for the regular salt.. doubled the pepper.. left out the pasta and the parsley.. added 1/4 tsp italian seasoning and 2 tsp worcestershire.. the parm is absolutely necessary.. it really brought this over the top.. this reminded me of minestrone.. ty for the recipe

Easy and tastes very good.  Definitely would like to improve on spices next time as somewhat bland prepared as is.  Loved the eggplant and ground beef combo.  May prepare with Hungarian goulash style recipe next time...

Other then using ground turkey and chicken broth, and leaving out the nutmeg (I don't care for it) I followed the recipe and it was very good. I think I will add some cabbage next time.

I was a little skeptical, but this turned out amazing! I ended up having to use two skillets to cook all the ingredients and then switched it all over to a dutch oven before I added the pasta (I used mini farfalle). I added Italian seasoning and used fake ground beef, that morningstar crumbles stuff, and it came out really great -- and almost vegetarian, other than the beef broth. It was a huge hit with both me and my eggplant-neutral spouse. Next time I'll cook the carrots and celery a little longer. This is definitely going on the regular dinner rotation in the blxbrg household.

Words cannot describe how good and hearty this tasted. As a vegetarian, it's difficult to find a decent, filling soup so I was happy to have found this. Will make this again and again.

Great tasting soup. Followed the recipe exactly. Even the 6year old grandson who is very picky loved it!. I do not say the word eggplant when they ask what's cooking. I just say hamburger soup. They have asked me at least once a week to make it. This soup is so easy even a beginner can make it! Tried it with leftover turkey and used chicken stock instead of beef, delicious.

I love this soup but I did play with the recipe. I cut the eggplant in to 1/2 in cubes, and roasted them in the oven. I added a ear of fresh corn (cut off the cob). It was delicious!

I took this to a party and didn't tell anyone there was eggplant in it! Even my husband still doesn't know that eggplant was the base. This worked well with so much eggplant from my CSA.

I am quite impressed, and eggplant does not impress me. I halved the recipe, but bulked it with extra veggies (rutabaga and chard)
I omitted the sugar completely as I do not appreciate sweet in my soups.
I did not have chopped tomatoes so used half a cup of tomato sauce and added Italian seasoning to it. I can't wait for leftovers!

Made exactly as described, except I had no celery or carrots so I replaced them with zucchini, this was a delicious soup with loads of flavour, I would like to try again with the celery and carrots as I bet it would have even more flavour!

I made this for dinner last night.  It turned out excellent.  Even my hubby ate most of his, and he doesn't like eggplant.  I had to make a few adjustments based on what I had. Chicken base and water instead of beef broth, as well as, plain diced tomatoes with liquid. Also omitted the sugar and salt, and added oregano, cumin and worcestershire sauce.

I liked it, but my husband couldn't stand to eat it. If I make this again, I will cook the noodles separately then add them to each bowl just before serving. Otherwise, if you have leftovers the noodles get really mushy.

Wow, this eggplant dish was deeply satisfying. I made it into a thick goulash, rather than a soup. I added bouillon paste plus homemade beef broth to the hamburger meat. Since I only had petite tomatoes on hand, I added a tsp. of Italian Seasoning, a tsp. of tomato paste and a small bay leaf. Yum. Thank you for this delightful dish.

Used half pound bulk sweet sausage and half pound ground sirloin because that was all I had on hand. I'm watching carbs, so I added no pasta. Couldn't stop eating it! I'll definitely make this again and again.

Wonderful surprise!--searched recipe and made only because eggplants were given to me--left out macaroni, used beef base as broth and pureed fresh tomatoes (lots on hand). Will purchase ep and make in the future.  Husb. who dislikes ep--"delicious"!.

This is awesome! I put in summer squash, carrots, and spicy Tex Mex diced tomatoes. I used a package of Yves Veggie Cuisine Meatless Ground instead of the ground beef (I'm vegan), doubled the nutmeg and sugar. Totally rocked! Never thought eggplant could be so tasty. :-)

So good!  I added squash and zucchini to the mix and didn't drain the tomatoes so there would be enough liquid.  Great time to sneak in whole grain pasta too!  I had to simmer this for longer than I thought I would for the veggies to cook, but I did double the recipe--so maybe that's why.  This will definitely be in the rotation!  Just don't tell the family how healthy it is!

Very good and pretty easy.  I was out of celery so omitted it, and added green pepper and yellow squash because they needed to get used.  Delicious!  We will make this again.

LOVE this hearty soup!  We peeled the eggplant so it wasn't bitter, added a couple more garlic cloves and used Rotini pasta instead of Macaroni.  YUMMY!!

This turned out really good. It gets pretty thick while cooking so I added more broth and water to make up for the water loss and also to keep it more "soupy" I never knew eggplant could tunr out so good in a soup. Would definately make this again!! Thankyou for posting!!

I have six kids, and a friend of mine has three.  Out of the thirteen of us (husbands included,) ALL of us like this.  I would never guess that there's eggplant in this.  It is also easily varied if you don't have some of the ingredients.  I didn't have celery, but I used a diced potato.  I also didn't have the canned tomatoes, so I used stewed tomatoes and added minced garlic.  FABULOUS meal and very filling.

My wife loves eggplant and I don't, so this worked out nicely since the dreaded veggie is so deeply incorporated into the flavor profile of this dish.  I used ground turkey, homemade chicken stock, and threw in some italian seasoning on top of the regular diced tomatoes I had on hand.  De-lish!

Very tasty! I left out the celery since I was out and I added a can of tomato paste. I also cubed then salted my eggplant and let it sit for an hour then I rinsed it and patted dry while the meat was cooking. When the meat was done I removed it from the pan and sauted the eggplant and carrot. Then I put everything in the pot and just let it simmer for about an hour before adding the macaroni. It came out great!

Made this because I had so many eggplants from the garden. I used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 ground turkey, added a little tomato paste and beef bouillon. I will make this again. Very hearty.

Really great.  Made a few changes so dish was vegetarian-- used morning star crumbled meat substitute and vegetable broth.  sauteed fresh tomatoes with meat substitute instead of using canned tomatoes.  Instead of macaroni, used brown rice.  Very hearty with delicious flavor.  Expect will be even better as leftovers when flavors have chance to meld.

Yum awesome stock flavor--I also used up my CSA box veggies on this one. Not a big fan of the eggplants rough peel, but I bet zuchinni would easily work as well.

Good soup. We used sausage in place of the ground beef with fresh eggplant from the garden. Nice and hearty. Nice one pot meal. Served with side salad.

Great recipe. Have plenty of leftovers. Only made a few changes. Used mild sausage instead of the ground beef and also added more carrots and celery. Didn't have pasta so ended up using ramen noodles. My kids weren't so crazy about it but the grown-ups loved it. Will make again! Great use of eggplant.

Very good!  It tastes a bit like the Bolognese sauce but is much easier and faster to make and not as heavy :)  The only thing is that you can't really taste the eggplant, which made me wonder if it would make any difference if I didn't use it at all.  Will definitely make it again.

I used the leanest beef I could find and it turned out well. It is a very flavorful and filling healthy low-calorie meal. I have been taking it to work for lunch. I did leave out the macaroni and added a box of frozen okra which worked very well.

Yummy!  I wanted to use an eggplant in a different way than usual and found this recipe.  I largely followed the directions but used more celery and carrots than called for and I added a heap of ground fennel which is one of my favorite spices.  I did not add parsley or paremsan since I did not have these  on hand.  I was not going to add a pasta noodle but decided to break a small amount of spaghetti into 1/2 to 1 inch lengths.  Tasted great!

This soup or stew was amazing !! My boyfriend wasn't too sure about it until he tried it and I got the 2 thumbs up from him. I have also doubled this recipe  for a larger crowd and received rave reviews on it! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was super good and pleasantly spicy.  I did make some minor changes though:  Used fresh mildly hot Italian sausage instead of beef, used one 28 oz can of whole tomatoes, chopped, in place of 2 cans Italian style, used 5 cups beef broth made with "Better Than Bouillon" instead of cans of broth, completely left out the macaroni.  This was a very satisfying soup and everyone ate it!!

Loved it.  The only thing I didn't add was the macaroni.  It's more of a stew than a soup.  I like a little kick to mine so I added some Franks Red Hot.  Easy and delish.

I thought this was just okay.  It was a little bland for my tastes and was missing that something, I can't put my finger on it.

I doubled the amount of eggplant and used cubed lamb instead of beef.  I added about another canful (used the diced tomatoes can) of water.

It was good but I probably won't make it again.  I like really flavorful food and this just didn't have it.

What a great recipe.  Everyone in the family absolutally loved it.  Even before it was done cooking I had called my mother-in-law to recommend it for her big bible study dinner.  I will be recommending this recipe to everyone who enjoys eggplant. Usually, I change a recipe a lot! this recipe I changed nothing!! Used it exactly as it was written.  Everyone enjoy!

Very tasty.  I think next time I'll use more beef broth as an earlier review suggests, as it didn't have quite enough liquid for all the veggies.

I was looking for a different way to use eggplant and found it.  Very happy with this recipe.  I agree for a soup it was a little thick, but I just changed the name to "stew".  I liked it the way it was.  I took it to my parents while we were preparing for a hurricane and it was just perfevt and very filling.  It's a nice, healthy meal.  I too used ground turkey.  Thanks for the new recipe.
