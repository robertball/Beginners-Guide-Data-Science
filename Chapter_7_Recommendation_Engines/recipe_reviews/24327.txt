Great recipe!!  Do not believe the bad comments. I usually add only 3/4 of a box cornbread mix and add an extra can of creamed corn.  We prefer it more corny and less bready.  A little pepper on top and it is a family favorite.  I am asked for the recipe everytime!!!  Kids love this and all items are easy to have on hand.  Try using a 9x12 baking pan and it will be done to perfection.

So disappointing and I thought it might be.  I found Awesome & Easy Creamy Corn Casserole on this site and it was fantastic!!!!  In addition to what this recipe calls for - it contains eggs and sour cream.  Won't be making this one again - my family is spoiled with the other!

This is, without a doubt, the BEST recipe for a wonderful dish.  We serve it with slow-cooked pinto beans.  A Big Hit.

I think I was disappointed in this recipe because I was expecting an actual "casserole".  This was cornbread.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't what I expected from a casserole. Sorry!

We love this. I double the recipe for a 9x13 dish. I have also added jalapeno's a few times for something different and that is also really good. I have taken this to several athletic banquets and always come home with a clean dish!

If your OU is for the Sooners then it is a five star plus!  Easy and inexpensive casserole made with things you almost always have on hand.  Sometimes I add green chilis and a handful of shredded cheddar.

I have a very similar recipe that is a standard for me and is always very well received.  This recipe is so much better than the normal milky corn puddings.  My recipe also has one egg and 8 oz, of sour cream.  That moves it from 4 star to 5 star.

This was ok but it was very bland. We were missing salt, pepper, onion powder. I personally think adding these plus some sour cream and an egg would produce a winner.

This was an absoulute hit! We made it for Thanksgiving for my brother who plays football for the oklahoma sooners. We thought it would be a neat addition to our holiday meal. I only made a few additions, I added an 8oz container of sour cream because i like my casseroles a little creamy and i added some cheese (krafts 3 cheese blend with a hint of cream cheese). THese two additional ingredients made this casserole a hit. My husband who is very hard to please has requested it  many times...so i will be making it for Christmas and also for his work Christmas party.  Thankyou Jessica for sharing this recipe!

My husband is a very picky eater who said he "probably wouldn't like it". He loved it, and asks me to make it all the time! I have shared this recipe with several people who also loved it, and will definitely continue to make it.

This was a wonderful dish.  Everyone loved it, even my grandchildren!  So easy and some thought it tasted like the corn cake at Mexican restaurants.  I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit!

This was a great dish.  It tastes a lot like Chi Chi's sweet corn cake!  I made two changes though.  I completely eliminated the margarine because I considered it extra fat and calories that wasn't really necessary and I also baked in an 8x8 dish so the bread would be a little thicker.  I did spritz the top of the cornbread with Parkay spray for a buttery taste and I considered it perfect!

If you're wanting cornbread, then don't make this.  If you're wanting corn pudding, then don't make this.  But if you want something that can best be described as corn casserole, then this is your recipe!  This was a very nice side dish to shredded pork bbq and coleslaw.  It was pretty sweet . . . maybe Jiffy corn muffin mix has more sugar in it than I thought or maybe Green Giant's canned creamed corn has more sugar than I thought.  We will definitely make this again, though.  The only change I made was to put this in an 8x8 so that it would be a thicker dish than what would've resulted from a 9x13.  Just increase the baking time as needed if you use an 8x8.

The other reviews made me hesitant to try this as my family is use to the typical corn casseroles with sour cream and/or eggs but this turned out great. I made this as written and baked exactly 40 minutes and it came out perfect. My family could not tell I used a different recipe.

As a college student, this was such a simple and cheap recipe to make! I did add one egg, and might try adding some skim milk next time, as I prefer a creamier dish. I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe.  It is a family favorite and it is so easy to make.  Sometimes I add cheddar cheese  and onions to the mix for a little extra zing.   Otherwise, I follow the directions exactly.

I cook for people visiting at our horse ranch and while the guests liked this very much (and hubby), I was not impressed.  I used cans of regular corn (since I had that on hand) added a "bit" of milk and just half of Jiffy Corn Bread box - of course all of the butter.  Butter makes everything better.

I make this and add shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture. I serve cajun hoppin john over it. Just cut it into squares like a cake, and top it with the hoppin john. It is amazing how good the 2 go together. Just like PB & J.

This is a family favorite in our household. Everyone always asks for the recipe! If I have it on hand, I also like to add about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.

I made this dish for our New Year's dinner. It was so easy and turned out wonderful! I used sweet creamed style and whole corn, 1/2 the recipe, baked in an 8 X 8 dish and cut down the bake time. My whole family loved it, including my 2 year old son. Will be adding this recipe to my list of favorites!

Made this for Thanksgiving and was a big hit. I do believe that I’ll use a smaller pan and 2 cans of creamed corn rather than one and one.

I didn't have a can of whole kernel corn, so I thawed some frozen corn and filled up the emptied cream corn can to measure the equivalent amount of canned whole kernel corn.

When I make this family favorite corn pudding, I always add 2 cups grated sharp cheese, or grated pepper jack and a small can of jalapeños, along with 1 cup of sour cream and an egg or two.  It makes a wonderful dish!!

Funny, we fixed this every week in college...but with a few extras. It’s an amazing dish if you add some corn syrup, and dice up some cheddar cheese in with the mix before baking (velveta works great). Then half way through baking it, sprinkle some shredded cheese on top. It was our "Cheesy Corn Casserole". I would come home and make it for my family and it wouldn't even last a day! Everyone loves it.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I used half the amount of margarine than the recipe called for and it was still SO good.  I like that you don't need to put eggs and sour cream or anything, because this is just perfect the way it is.

Don't know what I expected, but I was very disappointed in this. It just tasted like cornbread with corn in it. Maybe will try next time by adding egg and sour cream. Sorry! I had high hopes for this one.

This was okay.  Kinda bland for me.  I put lots of salt and pepper on it and buttered it after trying a few bites.  I made this one b/c most of the other corn casserole recipes had some ingrediants I didn't have on hand.  I might have liked those better.  I also think it could be better with butter instead of margarine...

I made this for Easter. I chopped the whole kernel corn in my proccessor a little to make smaller pieces.  I also used a 9X11 pand and baked for 34 mins.
It was sooooo good. Very moist like a 
cake.  I will make it again.

This is so easy and so good.  I served it today and everyone agreed I should serve it again for Easter dinner next week.  It was a huge hit.

This is the best recipe for canned corn.  I loved the taste.  Mine didn't come out with a bread texture so we had to eat it with a fork.  I don't know if that is the way it is supposed to be or if I didn't cook it long enough.  Still great.

Yum! I made this as part of our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. We all thought it was just like the El Torito Sweet Corn Cake. Now I can make it from "scratch" instead of buying the El Torito mix for $2. Thanks for posting this easy and delicious recipe!

Quick and easy!  Ingredients that we normally keep on hand makes it a last minute life saver in a pinch for a side dish!  Yummy!

Awesome recipe - the ultimate in traditional comfort food.  Followed recipe exactly (but doubled) and it turned out wonderfully.  Served it to guests and it got rave reviews and recipe requests. Super easy to make - will definately make this again.

When I doubled this recipie, I accidently added 4 cans of creamed corn instead of "2 and 2."  It turned out perfectly!  I baked it in a 9x13 pan for a little bit longer, but it was worth it!  I took it to a Thanksgiving carry-in at my work, and everybody raved about it!  People sought me out for the recipie and to tell me how good it was!  Thanks for the recipie!!!

This was so easy and so delicious!!!!  I only had to cook it 40 minutes and I used butter instead of margarine.  It's a very simple side dish and you'll find you have to go back for seconds.
