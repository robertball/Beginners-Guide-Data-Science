One of my all-time favorites.  I used Tilapia for it.  So many flavors - nice and spicy.  Salsa was so good!  This was rated a 10 by my whole family.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Wonderful and easy dish! I wanted something quick and easy, so I didn't make the salsa. I marinated frozen tilapia filets from Costco in the teriyaki sauce with some crushed garlic, then I sprinkled the filets with lemon juice and Mrs. Dash Chipotle Seasoning ( left off the pepper flakes and hot sauce) before cooking them like the recipe said. I topped it with fresh cilantro and served with salad and quinoa. Absolutely devine!

This recipe was excellent! My one comment was that maybe I would use less red pepper flakes or maybe no hot sauce..because this fish was spicy!!
We also used swordfish which was amazing...just like steak and very juicy from the plank.

I used Tilipia instead of Mahi Mahi, the fish was very mild and sweet. I did not have a ceder plank so I soaked apple wood chips and set them in a aluminum pan to lightly smoke the fillets. The mango chutney was outstanding. I will pass this recipe on to many.

VERY GOOD!!!! My husband and I usually don't like fish but loved this. We used Mahi Mahi and used cedar planks. We didn't use the hot pepper oil and it was just spicy enough. Will make again.

This was excellent, my fiance who hates fish even loved it. I made it as my first attempt to cook/eat mahi mahi and I was completely impressed.  I was however forced to change a couple things, I had to use mesquite instead of chipotle because our local store didn't have chipotle, and instead of a halepeno i used a mini hot pepper from my own garden as well, I had to cook it in my frying pan.  definately cured my fear of mahi mahi and filled everyone, not to mention the mango salsa was fantastic!

This is a great recipe. I always have leftovers of the mango salsa so I take it to work to share & everyone raves about it. If you don't have chipotle seasoning you can always used smoked paprika (a very yummy spice)

Everyone in the house loved the fish and the marinade.  I would absolutely do this fish preparation again.  We weren't crazy about the mango salsa.  The concept is right on, but something was lacking in the flavor.  I'll play with the recipe a little more next time.

I loved this!  I left out the cilantro because I don't like it.  Other than that, I made as is and couldn't have been happier with it.  My husband loved it also.  He was skeptical, but said it was a high quality meal.  Yay!  I loved the plank cooking also.  It seemed so organic!

My wife and I just tried this for the 1st of what will be many times! The salsa was pretty much exact except I added celery. We didn’t use chipotle seasoning but did use a little rosemary/lime blend by Tone’s. It was amazing,

Whole Foods was out of Mahi Mahi, so they recommended fresh  Wild Black Drum Filet.  It was the perfect base for this spicy recipe, and my family likes spicy.  The mango salsa was as tasty as it was beautiful.  The colors and presentation of this dish was stunning.  We had 2 1/2 lbs of fish and used a huge plank which could not be moved from direct to indirect heat, so we just grilled the plank over direct heat for 15 minutes.  This recipe is a definite keeper, will be making it again and again, and adapt to whatever looks good and fresh at the fish counter.

This is fabulous! We used the Mahi Mahi and while Tilapi would work I'm sure, I think that Mahi Mahi really is a much better choice for the recipe. Loved the mango salsa as well. I followed the recipe for the salsa and marinating as given. The one area I changed was the spices AFTER THE MARINADE. I used just a bit of crushed red pepper flakes, ground cumin, and sweet paprika. I think you could really skip that step even if you wanted and the dish would be great. Served with Japanese noodles that I just tossed with a bit of the teriyaki sauce for a simple side dish. This was a big hit with myself, husband, and 18 year old son.

FANTASTIC! This was a great recipe. I didn't have a cedar plank, but i cooked it on stove w/ a little butter and it turned out great. Be sure to make plenty of the salsa, cause it complements the fish so well!
