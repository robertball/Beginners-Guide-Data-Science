I liked this a lot.  I was looking for something quick and all the other London Broil recipes needed to marinate overnight.  This was ready in an hour and tasted wonderful.  Definitely will make it again.

Amazing!  The red wine added so much to the flavor and the meat came out so tender and moist.  Instant family favorite!

Wow. This was amazing. The herbs made the meat look gorgeous. I marinated it for 6 hours, but dont marinate it too long, because it will just taste too strong. It came out perfect.I had to double the marinade to cover the 1.63 pound cut of meat, and i used sherry instead of red wine. Works just as well. I highly recommend this. P.S- after writing this review, i've made this recipe at least 5 more times. Great every time!

I tried this even though I usually prefer only total 5 star recipes. I have done the soy sauce type LBs but this had a very nice flavor. Not too strong, allowing the beef flavor to come thru. Only variation was I used white wine. It came out pretty tender. I marinated about 8 hours. Mine wasn't as thick, only grilled a few minutes. One of the best LBs I've made. I served with a Mushroom sauce from this site too. Still looking for the perfect recipe to make the meat melt in your mouth tender though. Maybe marinate for days !! or I'm expecting too much.

The marinade was great, lots of good flavor. I kept some and boiled it to use over the rice that I served with the beef.  It was even better the second day!  I cooked the london broil on the grill and it was a bit tough, but I suppose that was because it was a cheaper cut of meat but I will definately use this marinade again.

Loved this recipe!  I'd never cooked a London Broil before.  My husband had been wanting one for some time and he loved it!  He told me over and over again (for days) how good it was and I've already been asked to marinade another one for his family at Easter!  Thanks!

This is the best marindade I have come across.  My husband was tired of marinades with soy sauce in them, so I found this one.  The meat comes out so tasty.

This recipe made tender, juicy, steak.  My only complaint is the italian seasoning.  Somehow that just doesn't belong on steak, to me, but I wanted to make it as written.  I will make this recipe again and use another seasoning.

This was a very tender piece of meat....but I was a little disappointed on the flavor.  I thought with the wine and seasonings it would be a little stronger, and I did marinade it for over 3 hours.  Will make again, but try to marinade longer.  Thanks for the post.

Turning Leaf Cabernet Sauvignon worked quite well!  Also excellent when you don't slice the meat after cooking but instead eat it like a regular steak.

I enjoyed the taste of the marinade but the directions do not tell you the amount of beef by the pound.  I had a 3 pound London broil and I had to double the ingredients to coat the meat well.  This would also make a good marinade for beef jerky.

This recipe is quick and easy. Everyone enjoyed it. The longer you marinade, they more flavor it has, as with any marinade. This one is especially good if it marinades for a few hours.

Used this recipe to marinate a 4lb london broil yesterday (doubled recipe to cover the meat).  It was fanstastic!  I let it marinate for 6 hours - it was so juicy & tasty.  Will definitely use again....

Absolutely delicious.  This is the first time I have ever made london broil.  I bought a very large one and had to double up the marinade.  I was sceptical about three hours being long enough time for the marinade but it was plenty.  I grilled it. I did use fresh garlic about 3 cloves instead of the powder and I pounded the meat before marinading.  Needless to say we had left overs.  We had fajitas with the left over meat.  Very GOOD.

This is a quick, easy, and very yummy marinade.  I had to make a few adjustments because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I substituted a pesto dry mix instead of the Italian seasonings, and McCormick's broiled steak seasoning instead of the seasoned salt.  I only marinated it for 2 hours, and it came out so tender and flavorful.  This is definately a keeper!!

This marinade was awesome!  I used this recipe as a basis for a marinade for a turkey london broil a few days later.  I switched out the red wine for white and the worcestershire for dijon mustard.  It was very good as well.  Both will definitely become regulars in my cooking!

This was a very flavorful recipe.  I put the frozen meat in the marinade for about 5 hours and you could taste it in every bite.  I did make a couple small changes.  I substituted Red Wine vinegar for the red wine and I also used half red wine and half balsamic vinegar.  I also used Lawrys rather than McCormick season-all.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  
Regarding cook times.  I cooked for 8 minutes per side and mine came out medium to medium rare for a regular thickness of steak over a high grill.

WOW this recipe was AWESOME. My whole family loved it, even my preteen who hates everything. I seared the outside of the meat then turned the grill down just a tad . It came out juicy and perfect. Each family member tonight said " you can make this again".

Also I heated the left over marinade and rubbed it on the asparagas we grilled it was so good!
THANKS for this recipe!!

I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed with this recipe. I'm not sure exactly what was wrong as I like London Broil and the individual ingredients. It tasted as though the meat was spoiled when I know that it was not. One star for ease of preparation.

The marinade is delicious, and it's nice that this recipe cooks so fast. We ended up trying to cook it in a cast-iron skillet, and it just didn't cook it through, even for the tastes of BF who likes rare(our fault though, not the recipe's). We ended up having to slice it and cook it even more.

This recipe was so good.  I have never made london broil before, but the directions were easy to follow, and it was an instant hit.  I made it again the next day too.  I used Mrs. Dash Italian Medley seasoning and Lawry's Seasoned salt instead of McCormick.  I also seasoned the meat in addition to the marinade.  I also used Sherry.  I marinated for 3 hours, then baked it in the oven at 325 degrees for 1hr and 45 minutes for WELL DONE, and added 1/2 cup water while baking for moistness.  I do not like any blood in my meat.  It did not come out dry, and tasted fantastic!

This was an OK dish, it didn't really have the flavor I was hoping for. I think "if" I make this again, I'll add more seasoning than the recipe calls for to see if that helps.

This was good, but a little blander than the recipe I usually use.  If I make this again, I will marinate it for longer (I only waited 2 hours this time) and add more salt and herb flavors.

Good marinade.  Unfortunately, the first marinade I tried was G's Flank Steak Marinade from this site.  We compare all other marinades to that one since we love it.  This marinade is definitely good but we still like G's better.
