This is an OUTSTANDING cole slaw!!!  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it was wonderful.  The second time I customized it to my family's taste;  1) used the prepackaged cole slaw mix that included green and red cabbage and juliened carrots,  2) added sliced green onions,  3) added mandran oranges sliced into thirds,  4) used fresh thinly sliced pineapple, 5) added cranraisins,  6) used golden raisins,  7) used sunflower seeds for the "nut" in the recipe, and lastly used "Marie's" creamy cole slaw dressing (Marie's can be found in any grocery store's cold produce section).  FYI - do not "overadd" the dressing as it will lose it's crunch....  Let it sit for a couple of hours for the flavors to fully marry before serving.  Enjoy!

Very easy and tasty. I bought one bag of slaw and instead of adding the raisins and nuts, added 1/2 cup dried tropical fruit mix (included banana chips, mango, papaya, almonds, etc.). Delicious!

Using pre-shredded cabbage with red/green cabbage and carrots, the light dressing, pecans, and mixed dried fruit instead of just the raisins, this turned out FABULOUS!!  I was addicted, and so were the luau guests!!  This went before the potato salad, chips, and even the desserts!!  Definitely a winner!!  7/26/09 update:  made this again for our second annual luau and once again, it was gone quickly!  LOVE this slaw!

this was simple and good. I don't have that particular dressing where i live so just bought coleslaw dressing, and added pecans.
A nice change from the usual apple/nut recipe.

Very tasty! I am not at all a fan of coconut, but still loved this recipe. Made it for a luau-themed party and would most definitely make it again.

A nice twist on the original hawaiian salad and cole slaw.  But instead of using cole slaw dressing I used and Island mango sauce and a splash of key lime juice and it gave it a nice heat factor.  Great Recipe

Quick, easy and a great change of pace for a summer picnic!  I made this for a family pot-luck and it was definitely a success.  I loved how easy it was to make, since I had about 30 minutes between getting home from work and the time I needed to leave for the party.

Great slaw! (And I'm not a slaw-lover). I used napa cabbage (had some that needed to be used), added shredded carrots (hubby insisted), used slivered almonds & I used a homemade cole slaw dressing (Easy Delicious Old Fashioned Cole slaw Dressing from allrecipes).

My family loved this.  I had to omit the coconut since my husband doesn't like it, and I couldn't find Marzetti's dressing so had to substitute a different brand.  Didn't matter; everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.

This salad was completly gone for our luau party.  I used a package slaw mix that I bought at the store and we don't have marzetti slaw dressing so I used another brand....it was EXCELLENT!

Well, to be honest, I can't say I made this exact recipe, but my end result was definitely five stars!!  I omitted the nuts and coconut (but might add them next time) and used Craisins instead of raisins.  I also added a shredded carrot for even more color.  Simple to make, pretty to look at, and delicious!!!  What more could you ask for???

I substituted broccoli slaw for cabbage and craisons for raisons.   Made it once with slivered almonds and once with pecans - both were great.  I used Marzetti's LITE, hesitantly, but it didn't matter; this was delicious.  And considering it took less than five minutes to throw together, I feel this is worthy of five stars.

Very nice change of pace in the slaw world.  I omitted the raisins and coconut, and used chopped dried tart cherries and chopped pecans.  They ompliment the pineapple nicely, and are nice for "non-luau" events.

this was a huge hit at my luau party - everyone wanted the recipe.  I left out the raisins, but left everything else the same.  I didn't tell anyone what was in it, because I had a few guests that always stay away from either pineapple or coconut, but when they went for an extra helping, I told them the ingredients, and they were totally shocked.  It seemed like a strange mix of ingredients, so I was a little hesitant to make this, but not sorry now!  It is just so tasty and if you bring it to a party, bring a few copies of the recipe because you will need them!

Reading this recipe again after I made it this weekend I think I forgot the pineapple.  It was still really good, I got the most compliments on this dish than any other I served for my daughters birthday party.

First, I should mention that I absolutely hate coconut, and raisons, but I made the recipe as is for a hawaiian themed party. I must say, pretty darned good, it received many compliments (most really like the raisons). If I have another hawaiian themed event, I will likely bring this, but I won't make it any other time.

Tastes so good.  I doubled the recipe and added sliced almonds for nuts.  It all disappeared at the family gathering I made it for.  Everyone came up and said it was the best coleslaw they had ever had.

Made this tonight by the recipe but substituted dried cranberries and forgot the nuts but it was still fabulous.  I used Marie's Slaw dressing since that is what I had.  Will definitely make it again and will try some of the variations mentioned here.  Thanks for posting it.

I used the tri color slaw bagged mix, macadamia nuts, and dry mango or papaya chopped into bits instead of the raisins. I used light Miracle Whip and a TB of cider vinegar with black pepper. Gobbled up fast at my friend's luau!!!

I used nappa cabbage, fresh pineapple, sliced almonds, and my own slaw dressing for this recipe. It was good but still seemed to be missing something. I'm not sure what.  I think it was kind of bland. I'll keep the slaw for myself to eat, but I'm pretty sure my family will not be eating it with me.

Awesome!  I tweaked it just slightly- adding dried cranberries along with the raisins, like other reviewers mentioned.  I also added frozen/thawed papaya and mango pieces.  I'm eating it for lunch today and it's great!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I enjoyed this. I ate with some broiled boneless chicken breasts. I wasn't able to find the Marzetti dressing so I used poppi seed dressing and it was terrific.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did add 1 small onion and cut back on the dressing to 1/2 cup.  You can always add more : )

WOW!! I have used this recipe for years. Only I don't drain the pneapples or add the coconut. Also, I add chopped pecans, shredded carrots and red cabbbage. This is always a great hit at any cookout!!!

I bought two bags of pre-shredded cole slaw.  In hindsight I would have shredded a cabbage and some carrots as I had to pick out big chunks of cabbage that did not properly shred.  I ended up with 10 cups of cabbage.  With that, I used a 20 oz can of crushed / drained pineapple, 3/4 cup chopped pecans, 3/4 cup coconut, 2/3 cup finely diced dried tropical fruit (I diced), and a 15 oz jar of Marzetti slaw dressing.  I made it the night before to let the dry ingredients soak up the dressing.  It made almost 2 quarts of finished slaw.  It had a nice flavor and I will make it again - but will probably make my own slaw dressing as I was a bit dissapointed with the flavor of the Marzetti dressing.

I made this without the coconut (personal preference) and I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins.  It turned out great:)  Thanks for the recipe.

Since moving to Hawaii I have eaten a number of cole slaw recipes looking for one that will satisfy my taste.  I love using golden raisins in cooking.  They were perfect in this recipe. I added the dressing slowly as I very much dislike cole slaw soup. This recipe is definitely in my cookbook for keeps.

I will be making this again.  Very easy to make, used one bag of cole slaw.  I used golden raisins and sunflower seeds along with the coconut, crushed pineapple and the Marzetti dressing. We love cole slaw and this was a very pleasing change. Yummy

I needed more Hawaiian flavor so I added some coconut extract (left from a delicious coconut cupcake recipe) and then it was perfect. It just needed a bit more of something.

This was okay.  I wish I had used slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds as someone had suggested.  Used half cranraisins and half golden raisins - next time will stick only with cranraisins.  I also used lite dressing - not bad, not great.  Adding mandarin oranges made it all much better.  Maybe I'll give it more stars next time I make it with almonds, cranraisins, more mandarin oranges, and regular dressing instead of lite.

This is the best!  I could eat this everyday.  I used fresh pineapple, craisins and added mandarin oranges.  The blend of flavors was delicious.  I only added enough slaw dressing to barely moisten the cabbage mix.  I don't usually like regular coleslaw.  I will be making this on a regular basis.  Thank you for a superb recipe!

DELISH !!! I went with the dried fruits instead of the plan raisins and added a little bit more of the coconut. MAKE SURE YOU LET THIS SET IN YOUR FRIG - THE FLAVORS REALLY INTENSIFY !!! I had a bowl right after making this, and then waiting, this is how I know !!!!

We used packaged cole slaw mix, added a cup of crushed fresh bean sprouts, a 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion-whole stalk, subtituted craisns for the raisins, left out the coconut, added a cup of crumbled imitation lump crab meat. No Marzetti's dsg. in our market, so tried papaya seed dsg,and oriental dsg [at different times]; both worked well, we thought. Crumbled-up wontons on the top are a good addition, also. Fresh pineapple in small pieces make a lot of difference-better! An easy recipe that is easy to improvise!

I'm not usually a big fan of coleslaw, but hubby loves it. Today I prepared this recipe, with only a couple of changes. It called for nuts, I used cashews. I threw in some dried cranberries along with the raisins, and a sprinkle or two of sesame seeds. The only major change was substituting a wonderful low-fat Mango Poppyseed Dressing instead of Marzetti's Cole Slaw Dressing. Without a doubt this recipe received rave reviews! Hubby said this is good enough to have for dessert. In our house, that is a very high compliment!

Made this for a luau party.  It had a good flavor but was somewhat soupy.  Next time I may use pineapple tidbits rather than crushed pineapple.  I drained and pressed the crushed pineapple and it still had this problem.  But will definitely try again.  Unique and yummy!

I made this for a church picnic.  WOW, it went fast.  I doubled the recipe, used golden raisins and added dried cranberries, along with the pineapple, coconut, and chopped almonds.  Now here is my secret.  I made my own Mango Poppy Seed dressing.  To die for!!!!!!!!!  Yummy and I brought home a very large empty aluminum pan.

I got raves when I made this for a 4th of July get together. I followed the recipe including the Marzetti dressing but I used a whole can of drained crushed pineapple.  I continue to get requests for the recipe.

This was absolutely to die for! I made this for my mom and step-dad, and my step-dad doesn't much care for any kind of slaw and he couldn't keep his paws off it! It's a great balance between sweet and tangy that's just perfect!

EXCELLENT!  Use Craisins instead of raisins to give it another added color. Layered all but dressing the night before and stirred in dressing one hour before serving to keep salad crisp.  Added nuts right before serving.  Will make again for family reunion, but may add celery seeds.

Had this slaw at a family fish/shrimp fry recently.  By the time the guys came in from cooking outside, most of the slaw was gone.  It was so good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Different and decent. I thought the original was a little bland....so I added a few things:  fresh pineapple instead of canned, dried tropical fruit mix instead of just raisins, & fresh banana slices. (The banana slices are a must!) This isn't a favorite of mine, but I would make it again and it fit in well with my Hawaiian themed dinner tonight. Made with Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker, baked yams, and fresh pineapple with Li Hing Powder.....ahhhh I miss Maui!!

I didn't have raisins so I used craisins instead.  My husband was  smoking baby back ribs and I made this thinking the pineapple would be nice with pork.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

This was a nice twist on classic cole slaw.  I left out the raisins because my children aren't big fans, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I served with grilled turkey burgers and sweet potato fries.  Great on a summer day.

This isn't your mother's coleslaw. The combination of ingredients elevates the flavor and makes it taste extraordinary. Omitted pineapple and added (as a writer suggested) one-half bag of dried tropical fruit mix, a tangy honey-mustard dressing. Well liked by everyone. Will definitely make again.

This is really a nice change of pace.  I changed out the raisins for dried cherries - just because that's what I had.  I added more than 1/4 cup - probably 1/2 cup.  I toasted some slivered almonds as the nut addition and also used at least 1/2 cup of those plus 1/2 cup of the coconut.  I think the extra amounts of those ingredients made for a better ratio with the cabbage.  I used a poppy seed dressing which was a very good choice - a bit sweeter.  This is a very nice recipe.

My husband and I loved this salad.  My grocery store didn't have the Marzetti Slaw dressing, so I used Marie's Slaw Dressing instead.  I'll definitely be making it again!

The quick and easy assembly of this dish is a huge factor, however, the wonderful taste cinched my 5-star rating!  Great recipe as is, but the 2nd time I added double the pineapple and coconut since I'm a huge fan of both.  Either way, a winning recipe!

I used Dole Tropical Dried Fruit Pieces and bagged shredded cole slaw mix. Very pleasing to the eye due to all the bright colors. A great side dish to take to a pot luck. Super fast to put together too!

My family has used Marzetti Slaw Dressing to make Slaw, Potato Salad and Deviled Eggs for year, in lieu of mayo. So before I even try this one I know it's going to be a winner!

I made this for a Red Hat party yesterday.  It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it and a few asked for the recipe.  I did not have Marzetti's on hand so I used 3/4 cup Miracle Whip and a little wine vinegar.

I plan on making this for my 50th birthday party with an Hawaiian Luau theme.  I had trouble at first finding the Marzetti Cole Slaw dressing, but I was looking in the wrong place. my grocery store has it in the produce area, it is a refrigerated dressing !!

Made this recipe for a 4th of July party and it went over very well. Because I was camping at the time, I didn't have any measuring tools, so I eye-balled everything. I added a little less coconut and use macadamia nuts (quite a bit of them). My husband has already asked me to make more!!

Very tasty - ranks with the best in my book. I agree with PPK, and will try my own dressing next time. Mayo and honey sounds good, but I would add something acidic (fruity vinegar or a citrus squeeze) to give it an edge like the Marzetti dressing.

Absolutely delicious! The best slaw I've ever had. I only used 1/2 cup of Marzetti Slaw Dressing for 4 cups of cabbage (instead of 3/4 cup) and I thought that this was enough.

Fantastic. Next time I'll add more raisins, pineapple & coconut, our preference. I wasn't going to pay $4.00 for Marzetti dressing so just used light mayo & honey. We did add dried tropical fruit as others suggested & would use that or canned also in the future.

I used a bag of slaw (cabbage and carrots)  added mixed dried tropical fruit and craisins instead of the raisins and had to use a different brand of dressing, and it was great.  I'll be making it again shortly!

This was delicious!  I would have never thought to add pineapple, raisins, and coconut to coleslaw.  I made it with already chopped pkg of coleslaw and then added the other ingredients.  Very good recipe.

I opted for shelled salted sunflower seeds rather than chopped nuts. Have served both ways, most people prefer the sunflower seeds.  Is a five star salad, tasty and so easy to make.

What an absolute wonderful recipe.  A great change to the regular old Cole Slaw.  I shared this with all the gals at work.  Modifications:  1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup slivered almonds.  WONDERFUL!

I made my own dressing (Easy Delicious Old Fashioned Coleslaw Dressing, adding 1 1/2 Tbsp xylitol) and used fresh pineapple and packaged coleslaw.  Very refreshing salad!
