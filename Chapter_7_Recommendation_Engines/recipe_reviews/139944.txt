I loved this dish and this technique.  The spices used in the breading were right on, and the fish turned out delicious.  The only thing that I did (since I had 2.6 lbs of catfish filets) was add an egg to the skim milk and about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to the breading.  I will keep making this recipe again and again since my husband really loves seafood (and I hate frying fish).  A few words of caution, though - after the fish is finished baking, serve it immediately.  I let it sit for about 40 minutes in a warm oven (husband was late coming for dinner) and the bottoms became soggy when they were perfectly crisp after just being done.  Secondly, my filets were huge (4 filets equaled 2.6 lbs) and I had tons of breading and eggwash left over.  Afterwards I realized that cutting the fish into smaller strips/pieces would have solved that problem by creating more surface area for the eggwash and breading and would have made smaller, even crisper pieces of fish!

Excellent seasoning..not too salty at all.   Was crispy enough without having to flip over as one of the earlier reviewers mentioned.  This cornmeal seasoning would also be great for frying fish in oil, but for the healthier version in the oven it is still A++++.

Thanks!  Made this tonight (no garlic or onion powder and half the salt) and it was, as my wife said, "your best fish yet."  Had all the necessary ingredients on hand, prep was quick.  I also substituted crushed Triscuits for the cornmeal to make it a bit healthier -- worked perfectly.

I can't believe my tastebuds! This is better than fried!  I halved the salt, added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, and served with lemon and tartar sauce.

This was VERY good!  My husband from the south loved it!  I did add a pinch more salt and cajun seasoning to spice it up.  Also, cooked it about 20 min.  Thank you for a healthy catfish meal!

I will make again. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is it was wayyyyyyy too salty. And I love salt. Next time I will batter it and then just season it on the cookie sheet to my liking. Tooo bad.

This made the best catfish in the world.  We always get whole catfish from our store and I usually cook it whole.  I cut it in half and made it according to the recipe.  The only thing I did do was add a touch of cayenne pepper.  I made homemade sauce with wasabi mayo, real mayo, dehydrated garlic (my own) and a pickle in the chopper.  Nice change from what we usually do with the catfish.  Hubby loved it, that is half the battle.

This was the best fish I have ever had that was not fried. It turned out so crispy without the added fat from frying. The seasoning was perfect. I used oarnge roughy because I don't really care for catfish. I will be making this often. Thanks for posting!

Fast and easy! Pretty tasty, a little bland. Mine was not as crispy as actual fried catfish (that may not be a surprise to other people). I did try re-dipping/breading 2 fillets as you often do with chicken fingers to make them extra crispy. They were not! A little soggy actually. So only dip once! They will have more crunch!

~_~ Love this! Everytime I make this catfish my husband loves it. I'm a bit more enthusiastic with my spices so I'm rating the method more than the taste of the original recipe. Coating the fish before its cooked is the best idea ever! Neither of us could believe it was oven fried the first time I made this it was crispy on the outside & moist/flaky on the inside I'm making it right now for lunch! Thanks for the recipe, BTW people complaining about the 15 min cooking time need to read the recipe in its entirety bc it does imply the time may vary..........that's pretty much a common sense thing check the food before you take it out if it seems like it needs more cooking time then ummm cook it some more lol thanks again!

Full disclosure: I am a Louisiana native, and cooking catfish/basa in the oven is almost sacrilegious.. That being said, this recipe is incredible. I've tried 5 variations of it and found that Spraying the breaded fish with PAM (etc..) is critical! I've had great feedback keeping the same proportions, but halving the celery seed and adding 1 tsp cayenne pepper and two dashes of ground chipotle. I've looked a LONG time for a healthier alternative to fried cat and can honestly say this is ,y "go-to" recipe!!!

This tasted so good, better than fried. Cut fish into strips. Dip fish in 2% milk, then dip into a bowl of seasonings (seasoning salt, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, little garlic salt, blk pepper)  on one side of the fish strip and then dip into cornmeal. Served with southern cabbage & sweet potatoes with tartar sauce and hushpuppies on the side. **Only dip one side of the fish strip lightly into the bowl of seasoning, anymore than that the fish would be very salty.***

I was excited to try this baked catfish with all the good reviews but this just wasn't for us.  Wasn't crazy about the flavor of all the seasonings, way too strong.

EXCELLENT!!  Everyone loved these fillets and the fat content was soo much lower.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  I was so surprised how nice and crispy the fillets were.  YUMMY YUMMY!

This was the best tasting non-fried fish I've ever had and let me tell you I LOVE fried fish.  I WILL fix it this way from now on!! I used salt, pepper, garlic poweder, onion powder, paprika and a pinch of red pepper for the seasonings.

I have made this - oh probably 10 times in less than three months now.  My husband absolutely loves it.  We are from the south and know good catfish.  I love having an easy recipe I can do in the oven.  I make this almost weekly now.  I do have to turn on the broiler for 5 minutes or so at the end to get it truly crispy.  The mix makes enough for 3 large filets every time I make it.

This made a pretty good and crispy oven-baked fish.  It was just a little bit too salty for me, and I usually use more salt than most.  It did get nice and crispy in the oven.  I would use this recipe again and just cut down on the salt just a little bit.

Delicious.  Yields the most buttery catfish with a nice crust.  This is a KEEPER! I use grapeseed oil instead of cooking spray. This is an impressive dinner - perfect for guests!

Wow, these catfish were so delicious. My husband, who is from TN, was craving  a bit of taste of home.  He grew up eating fried catfish, so I tried this recipe. He was unsure of baking instead of frying but the fish turned out better that we expected.  I don't like deep fried food, so this was perfect for us.  The only changes I made was the following:

- no celery seed (we didn't have any.)
- garlic salt instead of salt, onion and garlic powder

Anything naturally Gluten Free makes me happy. This was very good, but it had a different texture than I expected. Next time I may toss in some potato starch or tapioca flour to get the consistency that I'm looking for. Thank you for the fantastic start!

Coating is just enough for 1 1/2 lbs of catfish nuggets.  Make sure to dip in milk - if you don't the cornmeal coating will be too dry and won't even cook.  Go easy on thyme - is strong.  Make sure not to over cook fish.  Pull out nuggets once they start to curl.  Even husband who is not crazy about fish couldn't stop eating these!  And SO MUCH more healthy than fried!!!

I followed the directions exactly, but these just didn't turn out for us.  The spices were fine, but the texture was nothing like fried catfish. Too bad, I was looking for an easier way to "fry" catfish.

I loved the preparation for this fish, but did find it lacking in flavor.  I even added cayenne to the seasonsing, but it wasn't enough.  I plan to try cajun seasoning next time.  What I liked was that it did crisp up in the oven and the breading never falls off.  Will definitely make again, but just need to get the season right.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the method of preparing the fish was wonderful, but neither my husband nor myself cared for the spices in the breading.  The fish was moist and flaky, and the breading crisped up very nicely in about 25 minutes.  I may try it this way again, but will adjust the seasonings to our tastes.  We didn't care for the thyme, and it was a little too peppery for me, although my husband liked the pepper.

We made this exactly they way it is described and possibly the best catfish I have ever had! We will add this to our regular meals, since my husband is the fisherman.

Don't forget to spray before putting in the oven. Just a warning as I saw other's note this and I almost forgot! This fish is about the best I've ever had. Turned out just like it was fried in oil without the greasiness! Nice and crispy. I invited my husband's friend to eat with us, a true country boy, and he was floored at how good this was and how I cooked it. Easy clean-up too! Thanks! This one has been filed in my special recipe box in the kitchen.

Good blend of spices for fish.  It didn't get crispy for me but i still enjoyed it very much.  Perhaps I didn't use the correct amount of cooking spray.  However, I will make this again.

I love this recipe. I know enough about cooking to know that I should choose my own seasonings to fit my taste and adjust cooking time to fit how well cooked I like my fish. I had very large fillets that took about 25 minutes to cook. The basic recipe is a great guide. For those who said the seasoning was off or their fish was not cooked after the time in the recipe should allow for that in their review. Cook error is always going to happen. But it is not because of the recipe per se but an inexperienced cook. Because my fish did not cook in the time in the recipe, I turned the oven down to 375 and cooked for an additional ten minutes. Not once but twice I had perfectly flavored fish that was cooked to MY liking. I also used cornmeal which I would use if I deep fried my fish, which is how I usually cook it. Just as crisp without all of the added absorbed oil.

OMGosh this was SO good!!! I didn't have celery seed so skipped it so I'm not sure exactly what is was supposed to taste like but it was amazing as it was. I might add some cayenne to spice it up next time (tonight) mmmmm, yummy!! Thank you & 5 WWPP points that tastes like fried catfish. Beat that!! Dieters/healthy eaters miss NOTHING!

I didn't follow any of the measurements exactly so I can't really comment as to the amount of seasoning but this fish turned out really good. I've never had catfish any other way except fried but this baked catfish was super easy to make at home and just as tasty. I enjoyed that it wasn't really greasy as well. Serve it up with some ketchup and did in!

This was good.  I am from New Orleans and my family always give a fish fry and serve potato salad.  However, next time I will use some creole season to season the fish.  I think it will give that nice kick that I am used to. I would also probably use 1/2 teaspoon of thyme next time.  My fish came out very pretty.  I am to lazy to post a picture, but do try.

A little disappointed with the final result, considering the rave reviews this recipe has been given.  The "savory kick" in the coating was definitely lacking flavor,  and rather than crispy was down right hard, although the fish was still moist and flaky after cooking for about 12 minutes.

I made this dish and BF and I thought it was great.  Had to cook my fish longer because they were more than 1 lb. each and had to make extra coating but it turned out fantastic.  Also didn't have corn meal on hand but had Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix - which made it a bit sweet - which I would rather it not be, but it worked.  The seasonings were absolutely perfect!!!!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I loved this! I love southern fried catfish, but I cannot get it where I live and I hate frying fish at home. This was the perfect remedy for my craving. I used hot hungarian paprika, added 1/2 tsp of dry coleman's mustard and no salt to the corn meal. Perfect. I'll be trying this on other fish when I cant get catfish!

Wow, was this good! Super easy and I love how crispy it came out. I did not find the coating too salty as others did - it was perfect. I didn't even need sauce, although next time I might squirt some fresh lemon juice over my fillets.   Leftovers were yummy, even if the bottoms did get a little soggy.   This one will be made often!

I am eating this as I write and it is a plate of crunchy goodness. A squeeze of lime completes the taste. I love the fact it is healthier then frying and tastes just as good. I did put the fish on a rack and set that in a cookie sheet, so the heat circulated around the fish and the bottom wasn't all soggy. I would like to try mixing panco crumbs with the cornmeal to see if I can get it Even crispier. Thank you, I will make this again!!

I was not crazy about the cornmeal altho it was nice and crisp.  This was very bland in my opinion - the cornmeal flavor overrode all the spices.  Needs some hot sauce in the milk or cayenne in the cornmeal mix.  I will stick with the cajun baked catfish (AR) it is very flavorful with no cornmeal.  Thanks.

I liked this, although I modified it to my liking. I'm not a big fan of corn meal so I made a mix of flour, bread crumbs with a bit of corn meal. I didn't measure, just threw some in there. I added salt, pepper, garlic, creole seasoning and parsley flakes. I then used catfish nuggets! Turned out well and I'll be using it for a fish taco =9

The recipe was very easy to make. I don't eat fish, but my fiance absolutely loved it!!! He said he didn't even need to drench the fish in ranch dressing or ketchup as he does with most meat he eats. That in itself makes this recipe a winner. The only changes I made: I marinated the fish in the seasonings and some lemon juice for a couple of hours (b/c I wound up having to run out as I was starting to prepare it), but I omitted the salt.  Instead of plain cornmeal, I rolled the fish in Louisiana fish fry and baked it with onions on top.

Very good - very easy. Loved the difference of cornmeal as opposed to bread crumbs. dredging in milk really kept the fish moist and the effect was perfect!

Loved the idea of oven-fried, wasn't thrilled with the taste. I should have added more seasoning. So much of my coating was the cornmeal and we are used to eating blackened catfish with straight up heavy seasoning right on the fish (with no breading). Also, when we reheated the extra fish the next day, the cornmeal made a big mess in the microwave. But, still really liked the idea of this dish and it certainly had the appearance of breaded, deep fried fish fillets without the deep frying, so it might be right up your alley, just not ours.

This was a bit spicy for our taste, but not bad. I didn't have celery seed, so I used celery salt instead of table salt. I also forgot to spray with PAM before baking. I cooked it for about 20 minutes, turning it up to 450 for the last 5 minutes. Both sides got very crunchy. May be better with some flour mixed in though. Even my son that doesn't like fish gobbled this up, must be a keeper!

AMAZING! Within 45 minutes of beginning this recipe we were sitting around the table. Neither of our boys is crazy about catfish (or any other kind of fish), but they BOTH suggested we make this one again! A squeeze of fresh lemon at the table was the perfect finish!

I didn't have any cornmeal so I used bread crumbs instead. Turned out beautifully. Perfect mix of spices.

I tried this recipe today.  If I make it again, I would cut the salt in half.  Too salty for my taste.  The spices worked out fine.  I did cut back on the black pepper.  Seemed too much for my taste.

My husband and I are from the South and we know how unhealthy these foods can be. We are always looking for healthy alternatives to these comfort foods. I was skeptical when I was making this recipe and thought my family might not like it. I was wrong! My husband and kids LOVED this recipe!!!!! We were fighting over the last pieces. 

Note, I did increase the oven to 450 degrees and I used catfish pieces instead of filets. Thumbs up!

Very good recipe. I dipped the fish in egg instead of milk and turned out just fine. Can be a little bit on the salty side do I would be careful with that. Also, for someone who does not like the fishy taste this might not be your favorite. Adding a dash of lemon helped with the fishiness. I don't mind the fishy flavor. That's what they're supppose to taste!! Very easy recipe! Worth the try and re doing.

My family loved this! My pickiest eater said it was "awesome"! I made nuggets instead of fillets. If you do this I recommend doubling the breading. This recipe is a keeper, will definitely be making it again and again.

I made this recipe using fresh and local catfish, but omitted the celery seed and thyme (I didn't have them on hand since we just moved). I coated the fillets with flour, then dipped in milk and then coated with the seasoning (this keeps the seasoning/corn meal on better, and it did stay on and looked great). The flavor though I thought was pretty bland. White fish needs all the help it can get IMO. If I make this again I would double everything but the cornmeal and catfish and make sure I had a good dipping sauce such as tartar sauce.

This was a great alternative to frying and our new way of cooking "fried" catfish. Added some cayenne pepper for a little more spicier flavor. Didn't have Pam or cooking spray so did use butter to coat the pyrex glass baking dish and brushed on a little melted butter on top of fish to help it cook. Left it in for 35 minutes to cook to our liking.

Great Recipe. I added some Cayenne, chili powder and fresh ground red pepper flakes because we like it spicy. Also, I used breadcrumbs rather than cornmeal. It came out really crispy and delicious. Served with rice and asparagus.

Really the best oven baked fish I've every tried.  I was out of milk, so I lightly brushed the fillets with mayo.  These didn't even need a dipping sauce.

I sought out this recipe after seeing an ad for catfish on sale at my local market.  When I got there they didn’t have catfish so I bought flounder instead.  This recipe works great with flounder.  The fish came out crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  I loved the texture and the taste.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and I cut the salt in half. This recipe is a keeper.

Fabulous!  Great alternative to frying.  My husband is a very picky eater and is very reluctant to try fish (especially catfish) anyway but fried and he loved this dish!  My daughter also loved it!  I will definatley fix this dish again! I didn't change a thing.  Perfect seasoning.

Great dish!  Do use 1/2 cup bread crumbs/ panko, Do use 1 egg with the milk and substitute the paprika with Ancho Chile Powder for that southern smokey bite!  Great Dish will make again and again.

I made this recipe for my husband tonight. He gave me a high 5 during dinner!  He praised the texture, flavor, and how quick it took to cook.  He said if he hadn't seen me put it in the oven, he'd have sworn it was restaurant made!    I used 2 fairly large catfish fillets used all of the seasonings except for the thyme (I didn't have any), celery salt instead of seed, NO SALT, and I used 1 full tsp of the listed seasonings.   I also added a dash or 2 of cajun seasoning on top of each fillet, as was suggested in another review.  I will DEFINATELY be making this one again!

Fantastic!  Better than fried.  I only had 2% milk and added an egg to it as one reviewer suggested.  I also added 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs to the breading.  Can't wait to make this again!

This was decent, but very dry.  The coating was crunchy, but I guess I missed the flavor and moistness of fried fish.  It was healthier though, which made me feel better about the cheddar bay biscuits I served with it.

Very easy and tasty.  Even my kids liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly, although on one piece I sprinkled a little Old Bay on because my husband loves it.

Pretty tasty... the first time I made it I substituted the salt and celery seed for celery salt... the second time I made this I followed the recipe exactly... definitely liked my way better... either way this is easy and pretty tasty!

This really WAS great! I never measure spices, just look at it in your hand and you will probably be close enough....I did add some creole seasoning and used almost a cup of cornmeal-however-I cut my catfish into small chunks.

I use it for nuggets instead of filets.  It takes twice as much mix, but it turns out great!

This is a wonderful recipe!  This is the first time I ever cooked a breaded fish. I loved the idea of baking a fish in the oven instead of frying it over the stove.  What a healthy alternative!  The fish turned out to be moist and flaky.  My wife enjoyed it too.  I will definitely make this again.

Flavorful, but not particularly awesome or good for company.  Recipe should mention to flip the fish so that each side is crispy.  Calories were right for those of us who are watching our weight.  Would I make it again?  Maybe, though doubtful, but if I did, it would be with major modifications.  Thank you for the opportunity to try it.  I might also add that we had .85 lbs of fish for the two of us.  We adjusted the recipe for the breading in half.  We still had about 1/4 lb of cooked fish for leftovers.  My husband says he'll eat it for leftovers, but that remains to be seen.

I followed the recipe to the tee !
ABSOLUTELY the best catfish that I've ever had !
And I've tried catfish from coast to coast!
There was one thing that I added ,which was 1 tsp of OLD BAY ! THAT WAS THE KICKER THAT IT NEEDED!

This is simple to make and came out well. I noticed a lot of people make it frequently. My suggestion is to mix up your herbs and seasonings in a larger quantity and save them. When you're ready to make this dish, do as one person suggested and sprinkle one side of the fish with the seasonings, and then roll the whole piece in cornmeal. This avoids any wasted spices, saves time, and they can be applied lightly or heavily from a shaker instead of dipping the fish into the seasonings. You can also adjust the seasonings to your taste and repeat your successes.

Very good recipe. Almost like I fried it instead of baked in the oven.  I only changed the cornmeal to Martha White because I don't like yellow cornmeal. I also omitted the onion powder only because I did not have any on hand. I will definitely make this again and make sure I have the onion powder.

I thought it was very good and my husband said it was a keeper!  The recipe was easy to follow.  We don't fry very much of our food. So, it was nice to be able to have it come out crispy without the grease. I did not use the thyme or the celery seed. I wasn't sure how the thyme would be and my husband isn't fond of celery seed. The crust turned out flavorful and light not heavy. I look forward to using it again.

I followed this recipe to a T (other than using only 1lb of catfish filets) and I don't know what I missed. From reading the reviews, I expected it to be salty but what we got was just a bland earthy flavor. It wasn't terrible, but if I make it again I will definitely be adjusting the seasonings for the breading.  On the bright side, it was super easy to prepare and cooked quickly, which is always a plus. Thanks for sharing!

A tip from one of the reviewers was to cut the catfish into strips before breading.  Perfect!  The catfish cooked evenly.  Also, I used Old Bay Seasoning in place of the pepper.  My husband raved about it.  We have a keeper recipe to make over and over.  Thanks to the person who created it.

Followed the recipe but I couldn't finish the second bite.  To be fair I am not a big fish eater, but was told by a friend that I would love this.  Didn't appeal to me.

I used buttermilk as the dip before breading the catfish. I eyeballed the seasonings but most of all, I doubled the amount of cornmeal and seasonings so I had plenty to bread the catfish. The end result was delicious and much easier to clean up compared to frying catfish.

Made it just like instructions, but bcz pieces larger, I cooked 25 minutes, then broiled for 3 extra minutes for little extra brown on top.  Family loved it and asked for it again!  A squeeze of fresh lime on mine was a very nice touch!

This was very good for oven 'fried' catfish. Except for the salt, I followed the recipe. One of the reviewers was right about not letting it sit, it does start to get soggy on the bottom. I wonder if baking it on a wire rack would make any difference. I'll be making it again, but will probably leave out the thyme and add a little Cajun seasoning. And try it on a wire rack. Thanks!

Crispy and as good as pan fried. A little more seasoning  would have helped, so I did add more.

Made as stated in recipe except I didn't spray with oil. The seasoning was completely overpowering and I ended up scraping off the coating and just sprinkling with cilantro to try and salvage the fish. Will look for another recipe to try.

A good option for catfish (felinus aquaticus?). Turned out great. Sure helps to cook it for an appropriate length of time. I did add cayenne to the breading and decreased the salt. First thing I did was make a fish burger w/ wasabi mayo and spinach plus a slice of cheddar...darn good.

Outstanding!  I went lightly on the salt, but followed the recipe as written.  I was  a bit leery of using  only cornmeal and no flour, but the crust was crunchy and flavorful.  I certainly will make this again.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

I got medium grind corn meal and think I would have just preferred breadcrumbs. 15 minutes took a little too long but it still came out alright. The coating didn't dry and crisp as much as I had hoped though.

The only change I made was I soaked the fish in buttermilk before coating.  The fish didn't crisp as much as I anticipated but it think this was because of the higher fat content of the buttermilk.  The seasoning wasn't to my families taste but I think with some adjustments it will be a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was so good I had to come back and write a review before the day was over. I made it exactly as specified, the only thing was my catfish filets were a little thicker than normal so I had to cook for 20-22 min instead of 15. My husband and two-year-old gobbled it up, saying they liked it. I think it's just the right amount of seasoning. I will definitely make again!

This was most excellent--both my husband and I loved it!  Very fast to put together, the ingredients are almost always in my pantry without having to shop specifically for this dish.  The coating is crispy and incredibly flavourful, and the preparation takes no time at all.  We plan to have this in our weekly rotation!

I didn't think the thyme went well with the fish, but the other seasonings and cooking technique were good.  Next time I'll skip the thyme and raise the oven temp to 450 to get a little more crispness in the coating.

It was really surprising to me that you can make fried catfish in the oven just using cooking spray. It comes out basically the same way as pan-fried fish. I've used this method on other types of fish like tilapia and orange roughy. It's much faster and cleaner than pan-frying.

Loved this recipe. I had to change some of the spices that the recipe called for because I didn't have them, but overall good recipe. I cooked my fish for a little over 40 mins though, they were big pieces - but they didn't come out dry at all.

Great recipe!! I used Swai fillets, not catfish.  Was perfect.  I wanted to say that it was salty, but when I wasn't looking my hubby added some Old Bay seasoning, then the 3 year old wanted to get involve and added more sea salt... But besides that, the color, texture and crispiness was perfect for this recipe.  I served it with a side of rice and sauteed zucchini

First catfish fillet I've eaten the whole thing of!  Husband was shocked to see me eat the whole fillet!  Usually I can handle only 2 bites of any catfish, no matter how it's cooked.  I shocked myself on this one!  It's a record!

Simple and delicious! I picked up some catfish yesterday and planned to bake it with lemon and butter. I found this recipe and decided to try it to change things up. Wow! Husband and kids liked it; it was super-easy to make. I didn't have celery seed, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Crunchy and yet low in calories.  Flavor of the spices minus the salt was perfect.  Certainly one of my favorites.  My husband only likes breaded fish and this satisfied his taste.

The recipe was overall good but I felt that the cornmeal made the fish taste dry in my mouth. I will make it again and maybe put some butter on top of the fish.

This was the recipe I chose to try. I've never cooked or eaten catfish that I recall, so when the Mister brought some home, I agreed to cook it. He ate two helpings and declared it great. I, however, discovered that I do not like catfish and I'm not particularly fond of the idea that the catfish had fins. (Yes, I know it's a fish but I'd rather not realize while preparing it that it was recently swimming.)

I can't say this is a bad recipe, because I couldn't eat it. My husband loved it. I'd say that if you like catfish, this is how to do it.

Have tried this several times. So much like fried fish you don't ever want to go back to fried. Very flavorful.

I read most of the reviews and thought this recipe must be amazing, well, it wasn't.  It was edible, but I will not make it again.  
I think baking it was a good way to go, but the flavors of the thyme and the celery seed were way too much.  I will stick to salt, pepper, garlic, and perhaps paprika.   My husband who loves everything said it was just ok, and I didn't care for the flavors.  I was a little disappointed... =(

Just fixed this dish. It was very good. I did use Jiffy cornmeal mix, as that was all I had. Too sweet, wont do that again. Next time I will use cornmeal. Again this was very good and will be great following the recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe. I love catfish but hate pan-frying it because I often scorch the breading. If you have a sensitive mouth like mine, cut the paprika and pepper in half, but leave the rest of the spices as they are. If you leave out the salt, you won't miss it.

We'll try this one again...it has potential, however as written our fish lacked flavor, and even though the internal temp was 170 after (fish is done at 140) it did not get flaky inside or crispy out.

Made this with Swai fish, which is supposed to be similar to Catfish.  It was great.  Seasonings were perfect.

The fish was soggy...none of us cared for this.  I'll continue to fry mine for the crispness even if it isn't as healthy.

This recipe was delicious!! The best "oven fried" recipe I've tried so far. My husband raved about it the entire time he ate the fish. Spices were blended perfectly - loved the celery seed. Thank you for the terrific recipe!!

My family and I really enjoyed the baked catfish recipe.  I used Swai as that was what I had on hand. The spices were just right and I love that it is baked and not fried.  Thanks for a great recipe, will definitely make again and again!

1st time I tried this receipe. Crust seemed to spicy for me. Next time i would cut the amount of spices in half. Also, the time required for cooking was not enough. Some of my thick filets were still not done to my satisfiction. With modifications, I will still try this receipe in the future.

I love fried catfish but hate the mess of frying so I gave this recipe a try.  It was good.  I didn't have celery seed so used celery salt instead and used less salt.  I also used 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornmeal as I usually do when frying (coating seems less thicker/heavier this way).  Mine didn't brown as much as I would have liked but maybe I didn't use enough cooking spray.  Will definitely give this a second try.

I hate frying anything so when I found this recipe I couldn't wait to make it. I didn't have cornmeal so I used Baking Magic coating mix. I was a little skeptical about the seasoning because I don't care for thyme, but the flavors were great together. My filets were pretty thick so my cook time was longer. They didn't come out all that crispy, but not sure if I had just sprayed them too much. I just turned the broiler on for a few minutes which helped some. There wasn't any left (except for the 2 I prepared and hid in the freezer). My daughter, who is not a big fish eater, had thirds!

gave it three stars because my husband liked it and I did not. I think it was just the cornmeal texture that grossed me out. Not the flavor.

Great quick and easy recipe. Rolled some brussels spouts in the leftover mix and baked with the fish. Delicious. I would recommend letting the battered fish sit about 15 min to soften the corn meal.

wonderful!!!!  My husband and I raved about it. I omitted spraying the fish with the cooking spray. Instead I added a small amount of olive oil (just enough to coat the pan), and baked it at 500 degrees for 12 minutes. Yumm

I made this and thought it was good. It wasn't as crispy as fried fish but much less fat. I'll prabably make it again to save the time it takes to fry fish.

Excellent recipe.  Fixed exactly like the original recipe suggested, except baked for 25 minutes rather than 15.  Served with sweet potato fries and salad.  Riesling style wine is great complement to the meal.

Disappointing - dry and bland. I used sole instead of catfish, but I can't imagine this being good on any fish. The only thing that saved this fish was Tartar Sauce I from this site.

Great alternative to fried! The spices were very flavorful! My cornmeal mix didn't crisp up as much as I'd like (I ended up broiling it some to add crisp), but it was still crispy some and very tasty!! I served this with jenn's catfish sauce (also on this website) and the combo was fabulous! This recipe earned a spot in my recipe book! Highly recommend.

Delicious. I added a little cayenne and lemon zest plus broiled for the last 5 minutes to make it good and crispy. Even my Grandaughter who thought she hated fish tried it and loved it.

I have to WOW.  This recipe was absolutely delicious.   I usually do not eat fried food.  So when I found this recipe for crispy fried fish in the oven I thought it was too good to be true.  But lo and behold crunchy fish that was baked in the oven.  I added my own spices to the cornmeal to give it a little more flavor.  This recipe was super easy and I will definitely be making this again.

Gee, I hate to write a negative review.  For me, this was just okay, and the corn meal didn't do anything for the fish.  If it had been deep fried, maybe it would have tasted better, but the problem was the corn meal taste with the thyme and the garlic and the onion just didn't mesh for me.  It sure looked pretty, just like the posted picture, and it cooked up nicely with easy clean-up.  Just didn't like it.  Neither did hubby.

This was really a great recipe! It was just as crispy as if I had fried the fish. The spices were great (I did not add thyme). I served with cole slaw and dirty rice. WONDERFUL!

This recipe was great I used Orange Roughy because it's less fat(I'm on Weight Watchers so every point counts) I often crave fried foods and this did the trick for my ff craving. It took a little longer then the required cook time other than that it was GR8!!!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used catfish nuggets and left out the pepper.  My 6 y.o. daughter helped me prepare it, which is another bonus when a recipe is simple to prepare.  This was awesome and my family loved it.  Thanks Mrs. Hermes!

Very good. I did add cajun seasoning to my dry mix and topped off our sandwich with remoulade sauce (an Emeril Lagasse recipe). This was a nice and easy Sat. night recipe that we had with a wonderful salad. Thanks.

I liked the idea, but we did not care for this.  I think it was the thyme that tasted out of place.  I'll keep looking for another breading recipe.

This was good, but not GREAT. I ran out of cornmeal before all my filets were coated, so I just threw in more cornmeal. The seasonings were nice, though I did not have celery seed, so I halved the salt and used half celery salt. The fish itself was moist and tasty, and while the coating was seasoned nicely, it didn't get as crispy as I would have preferred. The chances of me making  this again are probably at about 20%. I think I can find better.

I'm rating this 5 because we will "definitely" make again. However, I was not as fond of the heavy paprika seasoning and salt.  But with modifications tailored for us, this will become a staple.  Kid NOTE:  My kids scraped the coating off, but still they ate it until every bit was gone --- no leftovers!

Breading had good flavor, but the timing is off.  After only 15 minutes my fish was still soggy.  Had go turn on the broiler to get the top crunchy.

We really liked this recipe with one small change. I used half flour and half cornmeal because I don't care for the texture of cornmeal only. The seasoning was perfect and the crust was very close to fried without the fat. Will definitely make it again.

I thought this was a great recipe. Also, I noticed a few of the other reviews saying that it was too salty. I think this may be because you were adding celery SALT when the recipe calls for celery SEED.

This had a great taste.  I had everything for it in the pantry except I used "smoked" paprika rather than the regular stuff.  I used a little over a half teaspoon of salt since the other person said theirs was too salty.  Mine wasn't too salty at all.  But I'm giving it 4 stars because the coating wasn't crisp enough for my liking.  Next time, I won't spray as much cooking spray on it.

Overall, good recipe. Nothing spectacular. I didnt have celery salt, so I think that left the flavor a little bland. I made these with catfish and white bass. Both were good. I both baked and fried some. The baked ones had more flavor. The fried ones lost it in the grease I imagine. I ran low on breading (a lot of fish) so added some flour and more spices. It was good both ways. Very nice crunch from the oven. Much healthier way to get your fish. I will experiment with breading though. I like it crunchy, but dont like the gritty cornmeal.

This was excellent! We had 4 whole catfish, so I doubled the recipe, and baked a little longer.  The seasonings were perfect.  We would definitely use this recipe again.

This was fantastic and so easy,   will definitely make it often!    My spouse is a fisherman and has always done the fish frying and it was good but due to heart diet needed to cut the oil and this was perfect. Spraying the fish before baking I think made it nice and crisp.

This was SO good. I will make it again and again. I love fish just about any way but my boyfriend doesn't, and we both loved this. I highly recommend trying this if you have children who are picky eaters.
