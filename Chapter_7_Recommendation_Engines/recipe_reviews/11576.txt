If one does not have flour and sugar then these would fit the bill nicely. I ran out of all purp. flour and have had Jiffy brand baking mix I've been trying to use up so worked out well. Used 1 box vanilla and 1 box french vanilla pudding mixes. Used small cookie scoop and made 37 cookies instead of the stated 20. Placed a Hershey's Almond Kiss in the center of each one (figured the Kiss would fit in with Valentine's Day theme) These did remind me of blackeyed Susan's w/the yellow dough. The dough is very oily...but very easy dough to roll in balls; no sticking at all. Rolled up quickly. The most time-consuming part was unwrapping the kisses:) I did find on a darker non-stick sheet they only went for 7 minutes and they were darker on the bottom than I usually like; 10 min. on the Airbake; which usually take longer so watch the time...I think 10 min. is too much especially with the oil. They are not really sweet so make sure they are dolled up with something sweeter in the middle for the 'brown eye'. I wouldn't go out of my way to make again but quick and easy. If making 20 of these and only using 1 choc. chip for the center I think they would be very blah-tasting. They did taste pretty good w/the Hershey's kiss.

I brought these to a meeting and at the end the speaker asked if there were any questions. The only question was "Are there any of those cookies left?" I got one recipe request and several rave reviews. Instead of chocolate chips I used a small disc-shaped chocolate that was available in bulk at the store so I didn't have to buy and open a whole bag of chocolate chips. I haven't tried other pudding flavors yet but I think chocolate and butterscotch (and maybe pistachio) would be good.

These were only fair--not very sweet. AFter tasting them and being disappointed I added a dollop of chocolate frosting onto each one which made them much better.

I took into consideration the complaints about lack of sweetness and added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar. Maybe that made the difference because my coworkers certainly scarfed them down! This is a good recipe for people not quite ready to make cookies all the way from scratch.

Use French Vanilla flavor pudding mix instead of plain vanilla. It will be much sweeter.

My husband loved these simple cookies. Corrine is right you can use whatever flavor of pudding you like.I had one box of pistachio pudding and one box of vanilla instant pudding. This recipe is very forgiving. I can see it as one of the recipes my granddaughter would love to make. I made these cookies and added 1/4 cup brown sugar taking the advice of one of the reviews. I used a Tablespoon of dough and rolled them in rainbow sprinkles. I placed the cookies on parchment paper and flattened the cookie slightly (2 inch circle) and baked the cookies. Then I took the cookies out and pressed the Hershey's Kisses into the cookie. (I didn't have any chocolate chips. Thanks Corrine! UPDATE: Don't use diet pudding the cookies will dry up to fast. After two days the cookies were dry.

The kids tried these. They were okay but not really brown eyed Susans. I noticed that most people who rated higher had to change something to do so.
