My wife and I really enjoyed this.  I did add 2 tbsp of butter to cut down on acidity and 1 tbsp of cornstarch to some of the clam broth to thicken up the sauce a bit, but neither addition changed the characteristics of the the original recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious I've made it a few times. My son is not a seafood fan but doesn't mind this. It may be because I don't over cook the clams. Clams as any seafood toughen the longer they cook. I imagine if clams were rubbery he would not eat it.  But I give it two thumbs. Even better the next day.

This tasty recipe is very quick and easy to make. Saturday night is pasta night at my house, and this sauce has been added to the mix.
