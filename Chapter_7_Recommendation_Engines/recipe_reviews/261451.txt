If you like hazelnuts, you will LOVE these cookies! I ground the hazelnuts myself and intentionally coarse ground, leaving some larger bits of nut. It made the dough more difficult to handle but gave the cookies great texture, flavor and crunch. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing. So, so good!

This makes a lovely holiday cookie. The cookie portion tastes like a delicious hazelnut shortbread. Two teaspoons of dough per cookie makes a substantial sized sandwich cookie. I put mine in the fridge to harden up the Nutella a bit before serving. Would definitely make these again. I used Bobâ€™s hazelnut meal for the ground hazelnuts.
