Authentic ! These baked meat rolls always feature
unusual combinations of flavors. This one is typical and tasty. Stretch your horizons a little and give it a try. If you arrange the ingredients
in an artistic way the sliced roll is striking on a buffet plate. Try something new and grow a little.

This recipe is great.  Just like the embutido my Tita made when I was a kid.  Sometimes I like to do part chicken part pork mixture and add a little raisins and ketchup in the mix.

This recipe is delicious.  My husband and I love it and he always asks for it.  It's very good served with rice and vegetables or a salad.

I should have known better: 8 oz of Cheddar baked for an hour in sleave of meat turns to grease.  And Vienna sausages?  What was I thinking.  Embutidon't.

This is absolutely great.  I made this identical to the instructions except I cut the recipe in half.  I will definitely make this again with no changes.  Maybe after the 4th or 5th time I will think of changes and/or additions.  I brought ketchup to the table but never tried it.  Thanks!

This was a nice change up on the usual meatloaf, but not a spectacular hit.  It was a bit of work to get everything together for a meal that was "just OK" at our house.  I probably won't make this again, but not because it was bad...it just wasn't a runaway hit for us, it might be for you.  Btw, I couldn't find hard chorizo, so I used chopped up Slim Jims (hey, they're a spicy hard sausage!)
