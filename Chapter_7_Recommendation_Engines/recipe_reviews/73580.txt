Wow!  These beans rocked at our birthday party.  No one went without eating them.  We used Frank's RedHot Sauce in place of the Chipotle since we had it on hand, but my guess is that it was just as good.  Some complained of the heat, but our beans were even gobbled up by our 18 month and four year old.  We even tried to make a second batch on the rangetop after they were gone.  We didn't have all of the fixin's so those weren't as good. Anyway, give these a try - you'll go back for more until the pot is empty, I promise!

If my husband hadn't liked these beans SO much I would not be leaving a review because I left so many things out....no onion, used onion powder, no real maple syrup, no chipotle sauce used hot sauce, no cannellini OR great Northern beans. I also make my own brown sugar using white sugar and molasses (so easy and cheaper than buying brown sugar!) I added about 2 Tbsp. of chili powder and a Tbsp. of Cumin. I cut the recipe in half also since I'm not feeding an army. Cooked this in my electric skillet instead of baking it. I also had to add about a cup and a half of water as it was cooking because it was very thick and we like our beans a little looser. Great recipe! Sorry I didn't follow it exactly but it still came out yummy.

I would have rated it a 5 star (that's what it should be) but the dutch oven was confusing me.  I might be new, but I know that certain pots and pans can give the food a different taste and I thought maybe the Dutch oven did that.  In anycase I just used a regular pan and I 1/2'd the recipe.  It was still plentiful even though it went kind of quick.  Very very delicious and easy to make.  I made it in my wok.  Thanks Danopak.

This is my first review, and I HAD to say thank you!!  These are the best baked beans ever!  I got raves from everyone at the 4th of July picnic.  The secret is the meat sauce.  I used regular syrup and whatever beans I had onhand.  Oh, the chipotle was a little too hot, but soooo good.

Wow. I use a higher proportion of beans to meat, and I make it on the stove top. but other than that, I stick to the recipe, and this is just about perfect as written. Thanks very much, it's a keeper!

We love these beans!  This seems like a large quantity, since it shows that it's for 20-25 people.  However, this is th eright amount for a nice sized birthday party or barbecue cookout.

If you make a MUCH smaller batch, you can simply continue cooking them on the range top.

I hope that you enjoy these!

I love love this recipe.  I made it for Christmas last yr and got rave reviews.  There may be a lot of ingredients but they add layers of flavors.  I know I have some in my freezer for whenever I may want some.

These are very good.  My DH just loved them.  So many levels of ingredients.  I did not have any chipotle sauce, so I couldn't add it.  But we didn't miss it either, since we have not had these beans with the sauce, I don't know what it added.  My beans were delish!  I had kidney beans, butter beans, pinto beans, grandma browns baked beans and navy beans, so that is what I added.  Like others I was a bit weary of all the maple syrup, but after cooking it just sits there in the back ground.  These are sweet beans, not tomatoey beans.    I will make these again.

I love this recipe.  I made this for my family at a barbeque last year and this year and everyone just love it.  My cousin even requested the recipe. This is a big hit.  I adjust the amount of beans because the recipe does not need that many beans.  I also use ground turkey and lamb and it is awesome.  Ground lamb give the ground turkey more flavor.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this side dish.  We took it to a bbq and got many compliments.  I didn't have any maple syrup, so that was left out, but it was sweet enough for both of us without it.  We also used chipotles in adobo instead of the sauce.  I also used kielbasa.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit!!

New favorite! Used more baked beans, no black beans (none in the cabinet) along with reg. brown sugar instead of dark for the same reason! Put 1 T. molasses to give a dark sweet kick. Could not find chipotle sauce, so I used hot sauce (about 1/8 C.) and it was GREAT. Don't know what could make this recipe better!

Easy to make. I took this to a party and it got great reviews. It was gone in no time. I'm making it again, although I'm not going to use as much chipotle sauce this time.

Out of the 3 different baked beans recipes I made for our 4th if July gathering this year, EVERYONE LOVED this one.  I did not have a large enough dutch oven, so I had to cook this on the stove top.  The stove top worked just fine in preparing this recipe.  I could only use the liquid from 2 of the 6 cans of beans, due to pot size.  To drain or not to drain, that was my biggest question concerning this recipe.  Pure 'amber' maple syrup was used and I thought the taste was wonderful.  I wonder if the one reviewer was using imitation maple syrup, that would lead to a faults maple flavor.  I can't wait to make these again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I lessened the "heat," though.  (;

I made this recipe for the first time three weeks ago and have already made it twice since then.  Great recipe to take to a bar-b-que.  I've gotten rave reviews.  I have had to cut back on the chipolte sauce for those that don't like the "kick" as much as my family does.

This was crazy good! Wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the beans or not so I did. Glad I did. We actually used this as a main course. Nice and thick and meaty. Also, didn't have chipotle sauce so I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce. Perfect. Not too much heat even for the kiddos. Make sure you use PURE maple syrup or you will get an overpowering, sickly sweet, nasty fake maple taste. Make this! You will be so glad you did!

I made this for my daughter's second birthday.  I made it in the morning on the stovetop, instead of baking it, and it is wonderful.  I kept 'sampling' it throughout the day!  Very easy and very tasty!

I made this and it was tasty but way to sweet for me.  I would use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 maple syrup.  Also, for giggles I put some all beef hotdogs in there as well.  I would do again but with minimal sugar.  Also, be sure to drain the beans.  That was not part of the original recipe and I drained them.  Added a little beef broth too at the end.

I absolutely loved this bean recipe and so did everyone else. I like that they are sweet and not real tomatoey. I also omitted the chipotle and then added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke and that gave them a real bbqy smell and taste. Great recipe.

Not what I expected. The sugar and maple came out too strong. Will not recommend.
