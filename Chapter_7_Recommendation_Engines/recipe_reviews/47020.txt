This pie was very delicious, but a little too tart for my taste! The vanilla ice cream definitely made it sweeter! Overall, it was a very good dish! :)

I only used the filling part b/c I was making a dump cake and opted for sour cherries from a jar and I had to thicken the juice.  I don't recommend boiling the mixture for 1-2 minutes; as soon as it comes to a boil you can turn off the heat, otherwise it will come out rather "gluey."  Turned out OK in the recipe though!

I was skeptical, but I made this pie, and it is outstanding. The only change I made was to substitute corn starch for the arrowroot powder (I couldn't find any here). My boyfriend, who is an atheist, said "Oh Holy Night is this delicious!" He doesn't use those words very often.

Have been looking for a recipe for a sweet and  tart cherry pie for awhile. This is perfection. It reminds me of a pie I get in my family's hometown cafeteria in small town Indiana.
