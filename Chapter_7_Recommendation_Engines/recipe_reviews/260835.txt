Very good. I used an immersion blender rather than a regular blender. Frothed up nicely.

This is quite delicious. I don’t have access to Mexican chocolate, so I used 65g Sicilian cinnamon  chocolate from Modica. It uses an Aztec recipe, so it’s almost exactly the same as Mexican chocolate. Thank you for the recipe.
