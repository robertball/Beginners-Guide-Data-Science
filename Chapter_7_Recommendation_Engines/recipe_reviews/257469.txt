I have only ever made puttanesca sauce with pasta once, and forgot how robust and flavorful puttanesca sauce is. No changes made, other than to reduce the quantity served. What I enjoy the most is the herbs can be adjusted to taste, add more for extra heat or less for a milder palette. I have only ever used anchovy fillets but do like how the anchovy paste dissolved, it is rather salty so just remember you can always add more so go sparingly, adjusting to taste.

I really wanted to like this.  It's full of all my favorite things, but we found the result overly fishy and the sauce not as flavorful as I would have like.  Followed the recipe exactly except I served it over spaghetti squash.

Delicious, classic recipe. I used whole anchovies instead of the paste and left out the capers because the kids don't care for them. This was easy to make and get on the table for a bunch of hungry kids. They cleaned the bowl with their bread, fighting over the last drops. Thank you for the recipe.

This dish took me back to my Grandmothers house in South Philly. What a food memory! The jar pasta sauce gave this dish a sweet taste which was nicely balanced with the cayenne pepper. I omitted the olives only because my husband will not eat them. I used 1 can of albacore white tuna in water and added the juice of the can of diced tomatoes. Next time I make this I will use my own marinara. Thank you for a great recipe!

I had my reservations at first about this recipe because it had tuna, warm tuna, in it but I was pleasantly surprised!  It was really good.   I made it exactly as written, no changes.  It's delicious!  Even my husband enjoyed it!  I will make this again!

We enjoyed this dish tremendously.  It is flavorful and straight forward to make.  We used Chunk Light Tuna in water, next time around I will use the Solid White Tuna in water which will keep together better and provide some bite size pieces.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this with the ingredients I had on hand. The worst snowstorm of the year do going out was out of the question! Wow! It was great! I highly recommend making this. My significant other is Italian and he loved it.
