Oh wow!  We just had it for dinner wish biscuits and mashed potatos.  

I sauted an onion and garlic before browning the porkchops.  I used a cup of milk for extra gravy.

I found this recipe very boring and kind of bland. It definitely needs some tweaks to add more flavor. Maybe add some garlic? I made no changes from the original recipe when preparing this dish. I will not be making this recipe again.

This was very tasty.  I ended up adding a little bit to the sauce though.  I added approximately 1-2 teaspoons of onion soup mix and about that much worchestershire sauce.  This was wonderful with mashed potatoes.  Thanks for sharing with us:)!!

a very quick dinner to pull together! i increased the grated parm to equal my bread crumbs (1/2 cup each) and added a dash of salt, pepper and garlic powder. after breading, i saved the leftover bread crumb mixture to add in with the soup & milk, as another reviewer suggested -- definitely thickened up the gravy to a rich and delicious sauce! and, because i added in the extra dry crumbs i had to increase the milk to 1-1/2 cups. i also added fresh sliced white mushrooms which added a nice surprise to the gravy. the gravy is what makes this dish! i only had two large-ish porkchops to cook and there was very little gravy left after we finished dinner! served with mashed potatoes and rolls, this made a great dinner. next time, i'll cook the pork chops a little longer in the first step to achieve a crispier coating on the outside.

This was absolutely wonderful.  The only thing I wish was that the meat was just a little bit more tender.  The gravy was awesome over roasted garlic mashed potatoes...this will definately go in our recipe book.  Thanks for the post.

This is a stupendous recipe.  I used 3 large, thick boneless pork chops and I had just enough gravy for them.  I increased the milk to 1 cup and it was definitely not too much.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs and added the leftover bread crumb/cheese mixture to the gravy to make a wonderful, savory sauce that thickened nicely and just turned out fabulous.  I used fresh portabello mushrooms as well.  

Do NOT hesitate to make this recipe but do add the extra milk or you will be sad that you do not have enough gravy!

Oh, I forgot to mention that I added about 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce for another dimension of flavor.  Yum!

These pork chops came out really good.  I followed someone else's suggestion and used almost a 1:1 ratio of bread crumbs to parmesan, which worked out nicely. I dont really like soaking things that are battered and fried, however, and may try soaking the porkchops in buttermilk to tenderize them, then frying them up after breading them (and serving the gravy on the side)- they were so beautiful before I put them in the sauce!  Thanks!

Very easy to make and very tasty. My chops came out tender and moist. I did add some garlic powder and pepper to the bread crumbs. I recommend this one highly!

This recipe was really very average.  Nothing bad about it, but nothing exciting either.  When you add this to the fact that my breading got soggy I will not make again.

This was so easy and quick.  My husband loved it too.  I even used Campbells Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup to lighten it up a bit and it still was great.  I also substitute 1/2 cup of dry white wine (like chardonnay) instead of the milk and it gives it a wonderful flavor.

This was very very good, even the next day it was amazing. Used the gravy for mashed potatoes. :) & I seasoned the pork chops before cooking.

Very bland, needs to be spiced up with some  flavor.  The chops didn't really have any extra flavor either.  It just seemed like it was missing something.  I was not as impressed as I thought I would be, after reading such excellent reviews.

This is a great recipe when you need a good meal in a hurry!! (but you want it to taste like it took all afternoon!!)  I served it with noodles and it was a big hit!!  The meat comes out very tender, and the gravy picks up the flavor of the chops.  Wonderful!!  Thanks Kathy.  By the way, grated romano cheese works well too.

Pretty good chops and "easy" is the key word here!! I added some onion and garlic powders to my bread crumbs (although I didn't nearly as much as 1/2c). I also added a little more milk (apprx 1 cup). Both the gravy and chops were tasty. Would make this easy EASY dish again.

This is much better than the cream of mushroom/pork chop recipe I had been using for years.  The use of milk instead of water, and the addition of breading the pork chops makes a great dish.  I also used 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup.

This is really easy to make and the gravy is very good. It's amazing what pork chops and a can of mushroom soup can do for each other.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This is the BEST pork chop recipe I've ever made. I used crushed pork stove top stuffing for breading, but did everything else the same. The only bad thing about this was I only had 4 chops, and I could have eaten them all!!! My husband said "You WILL make this again!"

I made this quickly last evening and served it with fried potatoes and a veg.  It was great and easy, I added mushroooms for the final simmer.  Great, easy, and satisfying dish.

My husband is a picky eater who doesn't care for mushroom soup at all.  He likes this recipe.  Goes well with mashed potatoes.  Tastes good warmed over.  Good stuff!

Good.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain.  Turned out tastey.  Any cream soup works in this.

very easy and quick dinner! it was scrumptious! read others reviews and used suggestions. kept the cheese down to recipe amount, but added garlic, onion powder, black pepper. dipped my chops in milk first and then coated. i felt the fire was listed too high. i will go with medium and low to simmer for next time. 1 1/2 C milk, soup, a can of mushrooms, and the left over breadcrumb mixture. i also sprinkled french fried dry onions on top before covering to simmer. No leftovers!, and husband asking me to add this to the make again list!! i served with shells and cheese as a side.

It is fairly easy to make and tastes good. Wouldn't go wrong on this since the condensed cream of mushroom soup is the key.

These were pretty good. I was afraid of them being too bland for my liking, so I added some Italian seasoning, as well as a little bit more Parmesan into the gravy at the end. I will make these again.

Just okay...nothing special.  I was looking for a stove top pork chop recipe and I had everything for this handy.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used about 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  I won't be making this again...it lacked flavor.

This was ok, not the best recipe to bring out a good pork flavor.  Mostly tasted like bread crumbs and soup.

With a few additions, this dish was excellent.  I sauteed some mushrooms, onion, and garlic before adding the sauce ingredients.  I also added some white wine to the sauce.  I served it on a bed of rice with broccoli on the side.  I'll definitely make this meal again!

We didn't really care for this.  It was pretty bland.  I used my regular chicken breading (bread crumbs, parm, garlic powder, pepper and parsley) I followed the recipe exactly but added pepper and garlic powder to the "gravy."  It still didn't "wow" us.  Thank you anyway, but we have a few other favorites front his site we will continue to use.

Added Worchestershire sauce, chopped fresh mushrooms, onion and some other spices, just because I always add those things.  It's SOOOOO GOOD!

I gave this 5 stars because it was quick and easy and still taste pretty good. The pork chops were nice and tender. The only things I added were fresh onions and mushrooms that I sauteed with the pork chops while they were browning. Served it with mashed potatoes.

After browning the chops, I sauteed a bunch of fresh sliced mushrooms to add to the mix.  My boyfried prefers his chops crispy, so I cooked his til they were done and left them out of the sauce.  Served the sauce over plain white rice, would have been good over brown rice too.  A nice simple meal that will be in regular rotation!

Simple & Excellent recipe! Perfect when the recipes is followed. Still excellent with substitutes (used shredded parmesan when I was out of grated; I was out of milk so I used canned beef broth).  I like to double the sauce/gravy (cream of mushroom & milk) because my 6 year old absolutely loves it served with mashed potatoes. Left overs are also great the next day.

Very good and very easy!  So moist and delicious.  I could fit 7 boneless loin chops in my 12" skillet and will double the gravy for that many next time.  Will make again!

This is an excellent dish, so easy and fast to make with a wonderful flavor with the parmesan cheese added to the crumbs.  I used the Campbell's 1/2 fat cr. of mushroom soup.  Next time I'll experiment and maybe add a few thinly sliced onion while browning the chops.

I had the same problem as some of the other people.  I think the chops I used were way too thick.  I ended up having to cook them for an additional 35 minutes to get them tender.  The dish itself was good and the sauce with white rice was very good.  If I make this again I will make sure that I do not use thick cut pork chops.

This is wonderfully delicious comfort food!  I am newly married and trying new recipes every night.  My husband made me promise to make this recipe weekly.
I added a small can of mushrooms and it gave the gravy a little more personality.
It was simple and delicious!

We loved this - we used cutlets and cooked the gravy seperately so the pork breading wouldn't get soggy.  I also put the pork in flour with garlic powder and then egg before the bread crumbs and parmesan so it would stick better. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very easy and perfect for a weeknight.  I used cream of chicken soup b/c that's all I had and it still turned out good.  I served it with rice and the sauce tasted great over everything.  There was a lot of bread crumb mixture left over so I would cut down on that.

Try this recipe! Very quick, easy and tasty. I added quite a bit more milk (about 1 1/2 cups) so there would be plenty of gravy, and also added some sliced fresh mushrooms. Great over mashed potatoes. Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe.

Excellent! ^;^  I used breakfast (thin slice) pork chops about 10.  I also added about two tablespoons of mince onions to the sauce.  I made the honey roasted potatoes as a side dish.

Everyone in my family of six loved this! I ran out of cream of mushroom (I had to double the recipe) and used cream of aspargus for one batch.  My family liked both.  I added some garlic and worshtershire sauce to the "gravy" because I use cream of mushroom in a lot of my dishes and I didn't want it to taste too much like the same old stuff.  It was great.

This was great! We were not expecting much what with it being so basic, but it was really good!  I halved the amount of pork chops (just two of us) and kept the sauce the same.  We had these over baked french fries and with a nice crisp salad.  REALLY good, will definitely make this again, perhaps with mashed potatoes :)

I have made this recipe a few times and its great.  So easy to do and the gravy is so tasty.  I used equal amounts of breadcrumbs and parmesan and added the left overs to the gravy.  Definitely a standby in my house for pork chops.

Thought this was great.  Quick, easy and the chops were very tender.  I added additional fresh mushrooms.

This was delicious! I added onion powder and pepper just to give it a little more flavor. I had no milk, so I just used sour cream in its place. Definitely will be making this again!!

This was really good - I messed up and didn't bread the meat first so I mixed the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese together into the mushroom sauce - very yummy though :)

I loved this recipe - I usually feel like my pork chops are dry and tough but the gravy make these really flavorful and moist.  I used thinner, tenderized pork chops which were great with this recipe.

I added a little salt, pepper and onion powder to the breadcrumbs and grated cheese. And I dipped the chops in egg before breading since it created more 'bits' for the gravy.  I used leftover white country gravy rather than cream of mushroom too.  They were GOOD!

This recipe was a good start but I only rated four because it was missing sliced mushrooms, onions (although I think every recipe needs those) and spices.. I used lots of garlic and onion powders.  But I did like now the soup made it's own gravy without being too filling.  The hubby ate it up!

WOW! Great tasting recipe! We'll do this again ... and again!  I tweaked it a little, though!  Threw a hand full or so of almonds into the Cuisinart and ground them well. Added these to Italian bread crumbs (about 50/50 with almonds) and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  Dipped boneless butterfly chops in egg and then into the crust mixture. Saved the leftover mixture for the gravy as someone suggested.  Added sliced mushrooms to low sodium cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of milk and the leftover crust mixture to make the gravy.  The only change I'll make next time is add ground pepper and cook the chops separately as the gravy made these wonderfully crusted chops a bit soggy.  No worries ... my wife & I cleaned our plates! Served with mashed potatoes & corn. Had some leftover gravy & potatoes which I combined and re-heated for lunch!  ENJOY!

I followed the recipe as stated but also took the following suggesting from other reviews:  I added ground pepper and parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs, i added 1/4 cup of red wine to the cream of mushroom/ milk sauce in addtion to some ground pepper.  After tasting the sauce I added a little bit of salt and parmesan cheese to the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

This was awesome!  I followed some of the other reviews and did equal parts bread crumbs to parmesan cheese and added onion and garlic powders and salt and pepper.  Then I stirred in the remaining bread crumb mixture, added extra milk, onion powder, garlic powder and a little worcestershire sauce into the gravy and it was delicious.  I cooked this for a birthday dinner and everyone, including my 18 month old son, cleaned their plates.  I served it with rice and broccoli.  Yummy meal!

I tweaked this recipe a tad. Added pepper and garlic powder. Other than that, followed the recipe and it came out delicious! I think adding the garlic powder gave it more flavor. I have made pork chops with mushroom soup before,but not with the bread crumbs..was really impressed at the difference! Will definitely keep this recipe :)

I had 2 pre-seasoned frozen thick-cut pork steaks.   I used Italian bread crumbs.   Discovered after starting this recipe that we had no onions left, so I added a packet of onion & mushroom soup mix; sifted   As a result, my breading was 1/2 c Ital bread crumbs, 2 Tbs parm/regiannno, 1 packet of soup mix with the the dehydrated mushrooms sifted out   Added 1 can of sliced mushrooms to the gravy mixture,along with the dehydrated mushrooms from the soup mix.  Like other posters mentioned, the crust lost its crisp in the gravy, so next time I'll keep the chops out of it, perhaps pouring some over the rice or potatoes and maybe a bit on the chops or on the side. Very Tasty! Hubby already asked for it to be a repeat in our rotation.

This was really nice. I also added some worstershire, garlic salt, onion powder, ground pepper, and parsley. I was sure that the chops would be under done when i took them out of the pan, but I cut the simmer time short anyway (due to all the reviews warning over cooking) and they were really perfect. I served them over long grain brown rice cooked with chicken stock with a salad. We enjoyed it. Thanks!

Wow this was awesome!  One of the best recipes I've made off this site!  I used butterfly porkchops and I did add garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper to the 1/2c breadcrumbs and parmesean.  And I added almost all of them to the gravey.  Ended up needing to use more milk though, next time I'll add at least 1 1/2cups.  Super flavorfull and yummy, my fiancee is already asking for it next weekend.  I grew up on alot of meat and gravey type dinners, and this tastes very close to alot of dinners I had as a kid.  Potatoes ended up being bad, so we had the extra gravey over bread and it was still yummy.

Very very easy, only took about 45 minutes start to finish. Tasty, there were no leftovers. Didn't make much "gravy" though, would double if it your family likes gravy with their potatoes.

my husband loves this dish he says that by making the cream of mushroom in with the meal it tastes just like real gravy, as in if you made it with flour milk etc.. but we love it and I just recently told my mother and she loves it also.

Easy and very satisfying. Next time I might leave the fully-cooked chops out of the gravy to maintain the tasty breading.

Once again, I never have good luck with pork chops.  Yet I keep trying.  This was a very easy dish to prepare.  I'll try next time with a different cut of chops and maybe reduce the cooking time a bit to keep them tender.

I really enjoyed this recipe but my hubby did not (it was porbably my cooking and not the recipe!).  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I also added a chopped onion to the mushroom gravy.  I will probably make this again, but just for myself!

We liked them! Husband was not sure at first but I think the taste grew on him. He is plain and likes his just baked.

EASY and WOW! I like this version instead of just plain old cream of mushroom soup poured on top! I didn't change a thing and my family wanted more! Very yummy and a keeper for now on! Thanks for this recipe! This recipe should have an over all rating of five stars!

I did not care for this recipe.  The parmesan cheese tastes too strange with the pork chops and cream of mushroom soup.  My family did not like it.  Will not make again.

My husband and daughter absolutely loved this dish.  I also enjoyed the flavors.  I substituted cracker and cereal crumbs as I had no bread and I added a few spices to the crumb mixture besides the parmesan (garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, italian seasoning).  Other than that I follwed the recipe except I added a full cup  of half water and half milk nad a can of mushrooms lightly drained and found the gravy was plenty thick.  I served this with rice for myself and egg noodles for the rest of my family.  I will definately make this again.

WOW!  I have cooked pork chops once about 10 yrs ago and never again.  With this recipe I will be making this often.  It's so easy.  I did use the golden mushroom and a splash of browing sauce.  The soup made an excellent gravy for our mashed potatoes and the chops were sooooo tender!  Thanks for the recipe!

My roommate keeps begging me to make this.  I used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of parmesan for the pork and then dumped the remaining into 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 Tablespoon of Worcestshire, and the milk.

Excellent! I wanted to make more than would fit in my skillet, so I browned my chops in the skillet, then transfered them to a couple of casserole dishes, mixed double the gravy in the skillet and poured that in the dishes as well, lifting the chops to let the gravy underneath. Baked at 350 for 20 min. Would probably also do well in the crockpot!

I like this recipe b/c it is simple and easy.  However, I felt that the flavor was bland.  Next time I will add seasonings when I initially mix the soup and cream of mushroom.  Also, it is a waste of breadcrumbs if you use the whole amount.  Thanks.

I make this all the time.  It is so simple, but tastes wonderful.  I generally make just 2 chops with the same amount of soup mixture because I just love it so much.  I usually add extra parmesan to the soup as well.  I serve with white rice or mashed potatoes.  Not a beautiful dish, but very tasty, moist chops.

Sorry guys...this was NOT a hit with my family.  I don't think we are pork chop lovers!  Had A LOT of left over meat, so I shredded up the meat, and the next day made shredded barbeque pork sandwiches.  Everyone ate them up...so at least, not all was lost!

Five Stars because it is such a versile and simple recipe!  Tried it just the way it reads and it was a hit with the whole family--even those who don't care for mushrooms.  Tried it the next time with chicken cutlets and cream of broccoli with a bit of lemon juice--also very good!  A nice basic recipe that doesn't have you spending hours in the kitchen.

Used seasoned bread crumbs and one cup of milk and breading left overs to gravy.  It was wonderful!  Kids ate it up, literally 'licking' their plates clean!  Will most definately make this one again and again!

My family enjoyed this recipe pretty well, although, I used boneless chops and I think they were too thick because they were NOT tender at all.  Will try thinner chops next time!  Very good taste!

My husband and I loved these pork chops!!!
I did however add a little soysauce to the mixture, (about 1/2 a teaspoon). I have been asked when I was going to make these again. Definately a keeper!!
Thanks Kathy.

Happy cooking everyone!!

This was just delicious, thank you Kathy! I added salt and pepper to the parmesan and bread crumbs just for some flavor and I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of one. My 3 yr old son loves it on his mashed potatoes and his rice!! I also added a can of mushrooms to the sauce as one of the reviewers suggested!

These were pretty good.  I'm not sure whether or not I'll make them again, though.  I like pork chops best marinated in an Italian dressing/dijon mustard sauce and then grilled.  I did like the fact that this recipe didn't call for a lot of ingredients and was very easy to prepare.

These were delicious!  I served them with mashed potatoes and used the gravy over them - YUMMY!!!  It was fast and easy as well.  I did have a lot of leftover breading, so I might adjust that next time.  I will make these again and again!

This was delicious! I added a can of cream of chicken soup, dash of garlic powder and a few splashes of worstershire and served over mashed potatos.  Only thing I didn't like were the chops simply because I'm not a pork chop fan.  Next time I'll do the meal with chicken in a slow cooker. The gravy is to die for!

Very, very good and easy.  My husband raved!  I added quite a bit of milk (with a little flour in it) to make more gravy.  I used two butterfly chops and plan to double the recipe if I make more than two.

Excellent recipe, both my boyfriend and myself loved it.  I served it over white rice.  Next time I may add extra milk to make the gravy stetch a little further, and I did add about 1/4 c. of white wine.

This is just what the doctor ordered!! Comfort food has never been easier or more satisfying. I added a shake of garlic powder, other than that, no changes necessary! Thanks, Kathy- this is a keeper!!

everyone liked the flavors of this dish.  i enjoyed serving it.  i have always had trouble with pork recipes... usually end up with shake & bake.  this will definetly be a "keeper" and a way i can make pork chops more frequently.

I didn't use the parmasean or the milk and added a can of drained mushrooms.  It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to cook, but I had boneless pork chops over 1" thick.  The extra time was WELL WORTH the wait!  These were delicious!  My husband loved them.  My only regret -- next time I'd double the mushroom gravy.  I only cooked three pork chops and ran out.  It was so tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe and a DEFINITE repeat!!!

Very good. Chops were moist and tender, and the gravy was very tasty. Definately not an appealing looking dish, but it makes up for it in taste.

I deglazed the pan with a little ( 1/2 cup) white wine before adding the soup and milk. I used 1 cup of milk, and added some black pepper. Turned out delicious. Served with egg noodles and sweet corn. Good meal and simple.

Major tweaks made for a great recipe. I followed other suggestions and used bread crumbs and parmesan cheese at a ratio of 1:1.... I also seasoned the breading mixture with additional salt and pepper. I used a handful of sliced, fresh mushrooms and a few cloves of roasted garlic. In addition to the can of mushroom soup, I used 1c. heavy whipping cream, 1c. chicken broth and 2 handfuls of the breading mix that was suggested for thickening. It worked like a charm with plenty of gravy here! Cooked everything on low for about 20mins and it was to temp. Really awesome with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans! Will definitely add to the family collection! Thank you for a great starter base recipe.

This sounds delicious, however I felt it needed a little more before I started. Made my own bread crumbs (any white or whole wheat bread will do just fine. In my case I used a diet whole wheat bread), lightly buttering the crumbs and adding garlic powder, black pepper, oragano and basil, toasted them in oven until hard (golden brown) let them cool then crush them. Also added a little bit of butter with the oil for the frying part. Added a couple of freshly sliced button mushrooms after the frying part.

This is very good, I always add some fresh basil and parsley to the bread crumbs and Parmesan and use Olive Oil instead of veg. oil. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and carrots.

This is the second time using this recipe, but tonight I decided to try with chicken.  When I coated the chicken i dredged it through egg and dipped into the bread crumbs twice.  After the chicken browned I sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions.  It turns out amazing!!!!

This is a great recipe!  I'm not a fan of porkchops so I was hunting for something to spice them up with and this did the trick.  We have them all the time now.  Mash potatoes and buttermilk biscuits go great with them.

The only changes I've made is adding more parm cheese and using olive oil instead of veggie oil.  I also sprinkle in some of the extra bread crumb mixture into the gravy.  :)

Both my husband and I agreed that this dish was FANTASTIC!  I'd make it again tonight if I could!  It will definitely be a regular in our house.  I used Panko bread crumbs, low-fat cream of mushroom soup and fat-free milk.  For anyone doing Weight Watchers, it's 7 PointsPlus with my modifications.  SOOOO GOOD!  YUM!!

Very easy and extremely delicious!! I dipped my chops in egg before coating them with the bread crumbs for a better crust. Will definitely make again.

This was a great recipe, my fiance loved it. I did make some adjustments only because I didn't have cream of mushroom instead I used cream of broccoli with sauteed onions and salt and pepper for taste.And I also did use a scrambled egg to dip the chops in before I put them into the bread crumbs.. I used a 1:1 ratio for bread crumbs to cheese like another member suggested.. It turned out great. A MUST FOR DINNER..

Really good! I had my doubts. WARNING: If you are using a stainless steal pan use extra vegetable oil! I almost burned mine, but it came out great!

We thought this was very good and easy to make!  We added italian seasoning, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the plain bread crumbs but think we'll add some chili powder next time too. Will definitely make again!

This was very good.  I browned and cooked the pork chops then removed them from the pan and made the gravy.  I didn't put the chops in the gravy but served it along side with rice.  Way more gravy than we needed but it was good.  In the bread crumbs I added garlic powder, thyme, Italian seasoning and parsley flakes.  Will make again.

Simple but good recipe. I always add something to a recipe so this time I added lots more parma cheese, italian seasoning, and some chili powder to the breading mixture.

To make the breading stick better, I double coated the chops, with an egg bath between coatings.

WOW!
I seasoned the bread crumbs quite a bit and this was absolutely amazing. Although we used pork loin, it turned out wonderfully. This could possibly be my favorite main dish I've found on this site. YUM!!!!

This was AWESOME! I used Shake & Bake instead of bread crumbs and I added a packet of onion soup mix and a litte more milk than was originally called for but it turned out great! I served it over rice with some cornbread and my boys loved it! I think next time I will only use 1/2 packet of onion soup mix because it did come out a little salty. But if you are looking for something quick and easy, this is it!

This was very good. We seasoned up the bread crumbs with some greek seasoning. Also used cream of chicken (didn't have mushroom soup) and add mushrooms/greek seasoning to it. I don't care for cream of chicken usually but in this recipe it was good!

I absolutely loved this recipe...I added sauteed onions to the gravy, which realy made it tastey. I used pork  chops the first time, then I tried this with chicken breast instead and I liked it even better. It made the chicken so tender and it wasn't dry at all.

Recipie is a great base recipie to add your own. I did not have enough parm cheese but I used seasoned bread crumbs. Was a bit bland and tasted much better after adding salt and pepper. Recomend adding more parm cheese and more seasonings. Wish I had read the reviews before I made it, like I usually do.....

These were pretty good. If *I* was the only one in my family that ate them, I would give them a 3. Since 3 others ate them and liked them, they get a 4. I, however, didn't really enjoy the flavor. They did cook nicely and were tender.

Very Good.  The only thing I did different was to use 1/4 cup white wine and 3 1/4 cup milk.  Also I added a cap full of Tarragon.  Very tasty and pretty healthy.

This recipe works great for low carb dieters if you use crushed pork rinds instead of bread crumbs.  This is one of my husbands' favorite meals.

Simple recipe!  I sprinkled salt and pepper on the pork chops before I breaded them with Italian flavored bread crumbs.  For the sauce, instead of milk, I used chicken broth.  I did not let the pork chops cook in the sauce.  Instead, I put the sauce on top of the pork chops.  Simple and tasty!

These were pretty tasty chops. I eyeballed the crumbs and cheese so I think I used a little more cheese. Also I probably added, again eyeballing about 2 tbsp. more of milk. I was surprised how tasty the gravy was, make sure you scrape up allthe bits stuck on the pan real well to get all that extra flavor.

This was a really great recipe. The meat was moist, tender, and tasty. I really like worcestershire sauce, so I added a little of that along with some pepper to spice up the gravy a bit.

To me, this deserves a complete 5 star rating!  My whole family has truly enjoyed this dish on a number of occasions ever since I found it in the Allrecipes cookbook a few years ago.  Unless we grill pork chops, this is the way we have them and it is often a dish requested by my husband!  With mashed potatoes and green beans it's truly a "comfort meal"...just like on the farm!

I've made this quite a few times now and it is very good.  I few things I've done is make it in the crock pot and I always use the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.

Fantastic! I just made this with pounded out chicken breasts - used one can beefy mushroom soup, one cream of mushroom, some milk, pepper, garlic powder and fresh pre-sliced mushrooms I needed to use up. Stirred all that together and poured it over the Italian breadcrumb browned chicken in the skillet (no Parm cheese - we were out); used the gravy it made over brown rice. EXCELLENT flavor, with so little effort! I wish I weren't so full...I want to keep eating this - thank you for submitting!!

This was very tasty. I will make the gravy separately next time. We didn't like how the crispy coating got soggy.

I did this recipe was 3 pork chops and this recipe is excellent. I added about 1/2 cup of milk, instead of the 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons. I also added the whole can of cream of mushroom soup. The gravy was thinner and I liked it that way, because I served it over mashed potatoes. Quick and easy and excellent ...A++

I don't like mushrooms, so I substitued cream of celery soup. Afterwards I found cream of onion soup. I will try that next time. Chops were fork tender and delicious!

This recipe was very easy to make. The flavor reminded me of city "chicken" that is made with pork cubes. Was good but a bit bland.

I thought this was an excellent dish! I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and it added a great kick! Since I love sour cream, I may add some next time, but that gravy tasted great on mashed potatoes!

This recipe is okay.  I'd probably add some fresh mushrooms to the sauce as the soup just wasn't flavorful enough.  But it was a nice way to serve chops other than frying them.

So easy to make, and so full of flavor. A bit on the salty side, but my husbands a salt guy so that's okay here. A staple in my house ever since I found this recipe. Thanks so much Kathy!

These pork chops were amazing!I used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup mixed with 1 tbs. parm. cheese resulting in a delicious rich brown gravy that was perfect over mashed potatoes! I cooked mine in the crockpot and it couldn't have been easier!Thanks for a great recipe!!

Oh my gosh, these were good!  Added a pinch of creole seasoning and pepper, but otherwise made the recipe as written (used 98% fat-free COM, as usual).  Loved it with the yummy gravy over steamed rice.  Next time, I may add sliced mushrooms and onions along with another can of soup.

This was easy and excellent!!!!   I added some extra spices to the chops including some Cayenne because we like our dishes spicy.
I sent my son to the store for some ingredients, and he swore he would hate the recipe b/c of the cream of mushroom.  Not only did he and my hubby LOVE it, but they were licking their fingers, and slopping up the gravy!! Thanks!!!!

This was a great recipe and a lot quicker than the oven baked version. I used 5 of the smaller boneless pork chops and still had plenty of bread crumb mixture and sauce left over. The gravy was great over rice but next time I think I'll try some mashed potatoes on the side. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I don't care for mushrooms so I didn't have the cream of mushroom soup. So I substituted it for cream of celery and chopped up some mushrooms for my husbnads portion. It was a huge hit in my house! :)

Yummy- this was excellent. I used low-fat mushroom soup and milk- came out nice and creamy. I also salted and peppered the chops prior to coating them. I had so much mushroom gravy left over I combined it with some rice and cooked ground beef and had a savoury hash.

I made this a while back, and my husband loved it.  The next time I make it, I will double to condensed soup and milk to use as gravy for mashed potatoes.  They go so well together.

Easy and delicious, making this a definite 5-star recipe. I'll be making this often but if I can find low-sodium cream of mushroom soup I'll use that next time since we're more accustomed to things that are less salty. The recipe is for four pork chops but I had eight in the pan without having to double the sauce. I just coated them all and stacked them. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is a picky eater and even he loved this recipe.  I used pork gravy insead of mushroom soup and pounded the pork chops with a meat mallet first.  Very tender and tasty.

Absolutely delicious!  I don't normally have much success with pork chops...generally they're tough, but these were tender & beautiful. I added Garlic Salt to the breadcrumb mixture.  I'll definately be making these again and again.  Thanks Kathy, from Brisbane Australia

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I doubled the soup and milk and used 5 pork chops instead of 4.  It was great.  Next time I would add salt to the breadcrumb/cheese mixture.

Two words -- EXCELLENT and EASY!  I used a half cup of milk and half cup of cream to thin out the gravy a bit but still keep it rich.  Perfect!  I used a really thick cut of pork chop, but I would recommend either butterflying or using a thinner cut than I did so the chop can soak up more of the gravy flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Have made this for years. Only changes I make are to add chopped baby Bella mushrooms and use chicken broth instead of milk.  I'm certain it would be great with the bread crumbs and cheese but didn't have them.  I also use a portobello cream of mushroom soup. Only seems to be sold in health food stores.  It comes out yummy whatever you use.  My husband really likes this.

I saw this recipe and decided to try it out.  I thought it was good, but as a few other reviewers have said, a little bland.  It definitely has a lot to like about it and is VERY easy to make and with a few minor tweaks really starts to come together.   After browning and removing the chops as directed, I like to add two gloves of fresh minced garlic , a medium chopped onion, salt and pepper to the pan and saute until the onions are slightly brown.  Then I add a package of diced mushrooms  and continue to saute until the mushrooms are cooked down.  THEN I add the soup, milk and more salt to taste.  You can also add more parmesan cheese at this point to thicken the sauce a little depending on how much milk you use (I usually don't measure out a half a cup, just enough till I achieve the desired thickness).  Enjoy!

I caramelized onions in a separate pan, then added 3 minced cloves of garlic for one minute. After I added the pork chops to pan I spooned the onion mix on top and then covered. Served with mashed potatoes. My husband loved it!!

This recipe was great!  I added some salt, pepper and garlic to the bread crumbs.  I also added some pepper and some sour cream to the gravy so I would have some extra gravy for rice and the sour cream gave it a little extra flavor.  Like some other reviews, I also used thicker pork chops and I did simmer them about 20 minutes longer while cooking the rest of dinner, and mine came out very tender.  This is a nice, easy, basic recipe that can be adjusted and spiced up in a lot of different ways to customize to what your family likes.

Yum!! And easy! The chops turned out tender and moist. Cooked all the way thru perfectly. I added some herbs to the bread crumb mixture (pepper, basil, thyme) and since I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand, I used cream of chicken. Lots of flavor. Served with roasted sweet potatoes and green beans. Will for sure make again.

Very easy and very very tasty.  We had Chinese take out the night before, so we were able to use the extra rice and heat that up with a little chicken broth for a great side and perfect way to use all the leftover rice.

Ever since I started making this my family begs me to make pork chops. People are always asking for this recipe from me.

This was a good base recipe which I made my own with a few additions. For the breading, I used 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup bread crumbs. After browning the chops, and before adding the soup to the pan, I sauteed some minced onion and garlic. I then added the soup and milk and a couple of shakes off wooster sauce (worchestershire). It made a LOT of gravy which I didn't mind as I topped it over some boiled potatoes that I had along with the chops. I would make this again for sure.

I tried the tips that Michelle H. suggested...loved it! This is the first time I made it and it was very yummy. Very comfort-food like and satisfying with only small portions. My boyfriend LOVED it! We couldn't get enough of the gravy! Yummmm! Definitely will make again!

After I tweaked this recipe, with worcestershire sauce and Lipton onion soup, this is a dish I expect to cook again!!! I used 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1 cup of Parmesan cheese because I didn't feel half a cup was enough. My family loved this meal!!!
