Didn't try this but I can see that the caloric count is ridiculous.  Maybe try using low-fat or non fat milk and condensed milk varities would alleviate the calories and fat.  I will try this recipe with the above sugggestions.

I have never had butter beer.  In fact, I have never read the books that inspired it.  However, I can say with assurance, that this drink is worth making.

I am giving it 5 stars, but that is based o me using this recipe as a base.  I added cinnamon and baking spices.  Next time I make it I will cut the sugar (may leave it out) and use vanilla beans in place of the extract.
This drink is incredibly warming and would be perfect for a snowy day.

This is UBER SICKENING SWEET!!  Even kiddo could not finish it, too sweet she said.  Gonna have to thin it out with more milk.  I would cut back on the condensed milk and instead of using brown sugar, use a touch of molasses..I just had a lick of the stuff-WHOA!!  TOO MUCH!!  I am a big sweet tooth but this is overpowering!

It was very sweet, maybe a little too sweet. It was great though. I dont think the brown sugar is nessacary and a teaspon of vanilla extract is a bit much. I also used fat free sweetened condensed milk.

It's great for kids, but I would cut back on the condensed milk and add more regular milk.

REALLY SWEET. Maybe, you can use half the condensed milk. Little kids would like this, but they are going to be jacked up!!! It is like eating crispy creme donuts.

Ohhh boy, this is delicious!  Even though I cut the amount of the sweetened condensed milk by nearly 3/4, I still have to give the combo of ingredients 5 stars.  Something magical happens when you add that butter.  We made it for Thanksgiving and was loved by all, even more loved with a shot of rum in the mug.  My 7 year old said "no wonder Harry, Ron and Hermione like this so much."  This recipe is the easiest one out there with the title of "Butterbeer" so give it a try.  I would recommend starting out with a small amount of the sweetened condensed milk and add to taste.

I didn't have the sweetened condensed milk, just regular condensed, but I simply added some stevia sweetner and it was perfect!

I like the simplicity and flavor of this recipe, but per other reviewers comments, we increased the amount of milk considerably to cut the sweetness. Now it's a family favorite for Harry Potter movie night :-)
