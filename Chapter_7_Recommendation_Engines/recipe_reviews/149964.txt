These are VERY good with a few modifications (the only reason I can't give them 5 stars!).  For the sugar, I mixed half brown and half white sugar to equal the 3/4 cup.  I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and half all purpose white flour, added 1/4 chopped walnuts and a few extra fresh blueberries (probably a full cup).  My 5 year old daughter LOVED them, as did I.  We will be making these again very soon, they are great for breakfast!

I followed this recipe to the letter using thawed frozen blueberries and canned pumpkin. I baked only 8 muffins based upon the volume of batter. I could have made a dozen, but I prefer larger muffins. These turned out very well and were quick to make. I think you will be pleased too.

Yesterday's jack-o-lantern is today's muffins. :-) DELICIOUS!! The best thing is, it doesn't use a full can of pumpkin, so I can make another batch right away. I also subbed 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of all white and baked 25 minutes at 350 instead of 400. Also didn't bother to thaw the blueberries, but it worked fine. Moist, delectable and perfect post-Halloween breakfast or snack. Thanks!!!!

I thought these were great, as did my husband who doesn't like pumpkin and my 2-year old daughter ate 2 right away! I am always trying to reduce sugar and fat so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I did not use milk but used 1/2 cup apple juice instead to add sweetness and make up for the reduced sugar. Then I used 2 TBS melted butter and 2TBS applesauce in place of the 1/4 cup butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. They are very dense and delicious and great with coffee. I made a second batch right away using chopped prunes instead of blueberries because I didnt have any more. VERY TASTY!

Great! I used 1/4 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c all purpose and I used 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp unsweetened applesauce. The muffins came out very well and were enjoyed by adults and kids alike. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the new family favorite in our household!  We call them "Blumkins!"  I added flaxseed to them and put cream cheese frosting on top.  Delish!

3 4 11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/149964/blueberry-pumpkin-muffins/ ... Not bad, but not great.  I changed the directions & it made them (look) less oaty (can hide them from the kids).  It' sneaky, but it works!  :D
I let the oats & the milk soak for about an hour - till soft.  Once they're soft, they disappear in the muffin.  Subbed brown sugar for white & 1/4c whole wheat flour for 1/4c white flour.  To help with the denseness, I added a half teaspoon baking soda.  They could still be a bit lighter, but I wouldn't call them dense with the half teaspoon.  I'm not a big nutmeg fan so I changed spices to: 1/2t cinnamon, 1/8t nutmeg & 1/8t allspice.  The sweet potato (yeah, I subbed for pumpkin) & spice taste was soooo subtle.  I truly could barely even taste the sweet potato & the spices, not at all.  Not wanting a spice muffin, I would still at least do the spices half as much more, or even double.  The flavor was provided by the blueberries.  I added at least a cup.
End comments (haha):  A good for you muffin, but I think I'd rather have blueberry-oat muffins or pumpkin/sweet potato-oat muffins instead.

These were fantastic! I did what some of the reviewers suggested, half and half brown/white sugar, and I used regular oats because I did not have quick cook on hand.  I think they turned out better for it actually.  I added almost a cup of blueberries instead of 3/4, and these baked perfectly in 20 mins.  Great for breakfast!

I made these amazing little muffins this past weekend. My only issue is they tasted a tad on the salty side. I think i may cut back the salt next time around. Other than that, they are perfect! That came out cute and little (i made a dozen), the size is perfect for a midday snack or with coffee in the morning. I also took a few notes from some of the comments, i used all wheat flour and split the sugar half white and half brown. Turned out great!

Pleasantly surprised at how good these were.  The flavors went together wonderfully.  Thank you for submitting something different and a little sneaky "super-food" into my kids diet.

Great muffins for a brisk fall day! They were very sweet so I would recommend using less sugar. Super easy to make and deliciously fruity!

My whole family loved these! I cooked my own pumpkin, pureed it, and used a whole cup, as I love fresh pumpkin! I added only a half cup blueberries (only because I was short), but another half cup of strawberries to make up for it, and will definitely use all 3 fruits again. I made them a bit healthier by using 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (no white flour), 3/4 c whole oats (blended to flour like quality in the food processor), and brown sugar instead of white. My husband isn't wild about nutmeg, so I'll leave it out next time, as he said he could taste it too much. But he still loved them! I tripled the batch and took them camping to share with our friends.

Delicious and moist. I added the blueberries to the batter after filling 3 muffin cups for my blueberry-hating daughter. They were just as good. These are so easy to throw together, I will make them often,thanks for posting.

Don't let the unexpected mix of ingredients scare you!  This works!  Only change I made was increased the blueberries to 1 Cup.  Made 12 yummy regular size muffins.  Fam loved it - will make this again and again.

These muffins are great!  Very moist, hefty, and delicious.  I made them into five larger muffins and they did take quite a bit longer to bake--more like 35-40 minutes.

I changed things.  Hate it when people aren't up front about that.  Okay: Switched out flour for whole wheat flour and oats for 1 part ww flour, 1 part wheat germ, 1 part ground flax seed.  Switched out sugar for honey and added a speck more baking powder to balance.  These are AWESOME and DELICIOUS and my little boyfriend loved them.  P.S.  I have a new boyfriend!!!  He's slim and really really short.  Not fat and mean like the last one!

I love this recipe.  My kids devour these.  I doubled the recipe and that gave me a full dozen of big muffins plus a mini-loaf.  There is a way to cut out some of the butter.  You can use unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter.  Use half the butter and then make up the other half with applesauce.  I would also say DON'T substitute butter.  It's so much better for you than margarine.

Fabulous! Such a fool proof recipe - I somehow had run out of baking powder and ended up using a teaspoon of cream of tarter, I substituted blackberries for blueberries because they were cheaper and added a cup of chocolate chips. I also needed to make these pareve (neither meat nor dairy) so I substituted canola oil for butter and almond milk for milk. I also added extra cinnamon and allspice instead of nutmeg. These are awesome! Definitely a keeper.

Sooo moist and so good.

I didn't have butter, but I had blackberry apple sauce on hand as a replacement. I actually think that's what made it taste so good b/c of the whole berry theme. Plus, it's healthier!

I also replaced the nutmeg w/ pumpkin pie spice since I didn't have nutmeg on hand.

Turned out fabulous!

Used exact recipe but a little less salt, per someone's review, and we used frozen blueberries.  With frozen berries, carefully mix in as the last ingredient just before putting batter into muffin pan.  We used a "Texas-sized" muffin pan, and they came out well but only enough batter for 5 muffins.  We enjoyed them with our afternoon tea.  Would also be a great snack with a nice coffee or espresso.  They were best when just out of the oven and still a little warm.

I didn't have blueberries, so I left them out.  Also, all I had was regular oatmeal (not quick oats) and they still turned out great!  My family and I loved these!!

The Best Muffins Ever!! Everyone needs to try this recipes. The combination of the oats, pumpkin, and blueberries surprised me at first, but it is a great combination. If you make these, you will love them.

These were good muffins.  I wouldn't have thought to put blueberries with pumpkin but the combination is nice.  I was liberal with the spices, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Theses are very good but the only issue we have is that they're very dense and heavy. I may cut down on the oats next time.

These were okay. I liked the pumpkin/blueberry combo. No problem with rising. Glad I tried them but probably won't make them again. Lacked a little something in the flavor department. Could probably remedy this with some experimentation with the amount of spices or pumpkin or something but you know how it goes, so many recipes so little time!

The pumpkin made them really moist. I didn't eat them fast enough before the last few went moldy. Good recipe, but I certainly had moist muffins

Was cooking up some pumpkin to make pies and decided to try this recipe.  Am I glad I did.  Perfect mix of flavors.  I prefer greasing the tin to get a little crispy on the muffin.  Will be making these again.

I love how easy they are to make. I also added a cup of frozen blueberries, also 1/2 cup of Brown sugar. If you like raisins, the extra sugar would probably not be necessary. Even with the full cup of berries,  I only had enough battery for 11 muffins. Great healthy breakfast 2 year old loved them as well.  My house smelled amazing this morning.

Awesome recipe - so moist & delicious! The only changes I made included using 1 cup flour & 1/2 cup oats to equal the 1 1/2 cups, but I wanted it to be more bread-like. Also, the oats were unsweetened maple flavored, and the maple went amazingly with the pumpkin & warm spices. This recipe also taught me that I love the combo of pumpkin & blueberries! The batter made 3 perfect mini 3 x 5 loaves, and I cooked them at 375 for 45 minutes. Thank you CKLEWIS for this awesome new pumpkin bread recipe!!!

These are delicious, definitely a keeper.  I made them with ¼ cup of milk and ¾ cup of pumpkin.  Also, I think they could be a little less sweet; the next batch will have ½ cup of sugar instead of the ? called for.  Pumpkin, oats and blueberries are all nice healthy foods to eat and these muffins made my daughter and husband eat a lot of them!

Great muffin, very moist and tasty! I make them for my 17 month old and he loves them! The only changes I make to make them a little more healthy is I only use olny 1/4 cup sugar, I use whole wheat flour, I use oil instead of butter, and I add 2Tbl ground flax seed.

I think these muffins are awesome! They are perfect for Fall. I just got done baking them for tomorrow and they smelled so good I had to taste one...OMG! I did follow the advice of others and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar to equal the 2/3 cup. I did know if it made them better or not because I haven't tried them with just the white sugar...but regardless-these are awesome!

I followed the advice of some other reviewers. I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour. I also used 1/2 brown sugar and half white.  I didnt have quick cooking oats so I used regular old fashioned oats. Oats were really good, just added texture. Healthier too.   Kids loved them too!

these muffins were delicious!  i only had old fashioned oats so to prevent the muffins from turning out too grainy, i stuck the oats in my food processor and pulverized them to a smooth grain - glad i did it.  the muffins were so incredibly smooth and moist! i had 1 sugar pumpkin left from the harvest that i roasted, and then mashed them, and pressed through a sieve to get a smooth puree.  all this took alot of time, but it was well worth it!  i would definitely make again and again and AGAIN!

WOW!  Yummy.  I followed directions to the letter and got a delicious, moist result.  I double the recipe and ended up with 12 muffins and 1 loaf of bread (which I just baked longer until the center was set).  Will definitely make again, this is a keeper!

These are really good. I underbaked mine a bit by accident, since my oven usually runs hot. So next time I'll go the full 20 minutes instead of 17 min. My 2 1/2 yr old nephew loved these! I felt good knowing that they actually have some nutritional value.

These are delicious. I use 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 cup all purpose flour and reduced-fat buttermilk for the milk. I sometimes substitute chocolate chips for the blueberries or banana for the pumpkin.  Always turns out great.

Wow! I hestitated at first because of the unusual combination...but after eating the first muffin and trying not to take a second, I quickly added this recipe to my keeper folder. I didn't have any eggs and substituted with 1T. flax seed and 3T. water. They came out beautifully. I like mine a bit spicier so may add a bit of pumpkin pie spice and will switch the sugar for Splenda next time. Other than that this recipe is perfect as is! Now I need to hide them until dinnertime!!

I made a double batch of these muffins. They are so moist, and yummy.  The only variation to the recipe I made was omitting 1/3 cup of sugar. Also, I used 2/3 cup brown sugar with 1/3 cup white sugar.

Worth 5 stars, because I made as-is and they were good. Now I sub brown sugar and add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice to kick up the flavor and we like them even more.

I made the recipe exactly as listed excepted I added banana, shredded coconut, and walnuts. I also increased the blueberries a bit. I think they would have been boring without my modifications.

These are tasty. They have an interesting texture from the oatmeal. I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought they needed more spice. Next time I’m going to try doubling the spices.

These were horrible.  The batter was very runny which should have been a clue.   The finished product was heavy and way tooooo sweet.

I made these muffins today and they are delicious! Moist, low fat, nutritious, and not overly sweet - thank you for sharing this great recipe! I'm allergic to dairy so I made a couple alterations: used cashew milk in place of regular milk, and Earth Balance Organic Whipped vegan butter in place of the regular butter. Even with the replacements, the muffins still turned out tasty. Thanks again!

Thought these were too sweet and not "pumpkiny" enough....I'm a huge fan of pumpkin. I would definitely cut the sugar in half and increase the pumpkin.

They were very good! I did make changes based on what I had in the panty.  I substituted 1/2 cup of honey for the sugar.  I didn't have pumpkin, so I used a cup of canned sweet potatoes.  I used wheat flour and a 1/2 cup of Apple sauce for the butter.  Very moist and yummy!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and made 2 dozen muffins. I didn't have enough blueberries, so used them in about 10 muffins. With or without blueberries, they were gobbled up! I will make again. Thank you for sharing!

I just made these this morning and like another reviewer, mine did not rise and in fact after even an extra 10 minutes in the oven they were still not thoroughly cooked inside.  I am not sure what I did wrong as the only modification that I made was, as others suggested, to use half white and half brown sugar.  I was so disappointed because I was excited for these muffins.  I did double the recipe to make some to freeze, but sadly I don't think I'll make these again unless someone could help me figure what went wrong.

These are very good. The pumpkin and blueberries make them very moist and the oats give them great texture. I used Splenda, margarine, and light soymilk to make them even healthier.

I liked the flavor of the pumpkin with the blueberry.  For some reason, I had an aversion to the oats being in there, so I think I will grind them up next time.

very easy to make and delicious.  I didn't have any blueberries, but raisins worked great - and I had lots of pumpkin, so I used extra and turned out perfect.

The perfect resolution to an abundance of pumpkin & blueberries! That being said, if I didn't have both sitting in the frig, I would have stuck to the basics.... probably won't revisit this recipe ONLY because I prefer the two staring individually in their own muffin.

I followed the directions of some others and did half whole wheat flour, half regular and half brown sugar, half granulated.  I tripled the recipe and only got 23 muffins.  Used 3/4 tsp. salt total.  They turned out wonderfully!

I was really looking forward to enjoying these muffins, but the amount of salt they required (3/4 tsp) ruined them. Way too salty for us. I will try again with a lot less salt. This recipe made about 10 small muffins for us.

These were awesome!  I live in Denver, so I adjusted for altitude by decreasing the baking powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons, increasing the flour by 1/4 cup, and increasing the milk by 2 tablespoons.  I made 10 muffins and baked them in a 325 convection oven for 30-35 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Nice bread with an interesting flavor.  I needed to make these sugar-free, so I used splenda, dark agave syrup and whole wheat flour.  I also used unsweetened applesauce for most of the butter.  H2 and I both enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again.

Boring!  Not enough flavor at all.  I used 1/2 c brown sugar & 1/4 c white sugar, and also used 1/4 c white flour & 1/2 c whole wheat flour.  I used 2 Tbsp butter & added extra pumpkin instead.  I used fresh blueberries, extra spices since I rounded while measuring them and also added pumpkin pie spice.  The muffins baked up fine, although I'd recommend using muffin papers to make it easier to clean the blueberry juice from the pan.  The basic recipe is fine, but if you want flavor beyond any blueberry you bite into, I'd double the spices.

These are relatively healthy so they are not "decadent" but I love them nonetheless.  I have a hard time limiting my intake!  The only things I change are to add about 25% more blueberries, and I bake them at 375 for 17 minutes using dark muffin pans.  These freeze very well so I usually double or triple the recipe.  They also come out well in baby-bundt pans.

Wow!  What a wonderful muffin!  The blueberries were so good in them.  I am ready to make another batch right now!  I couldn't stop eating them.  Definitely a keeper!

I followed some of the modifications from other reviews, including adding more blueberries, but I don't think this was a good idea.  They ended up falling apart since there were too many blueberries.  Overall, I thought the muffins were so-so.  (My dog liked them, though.  She jumped up on the counter and ate 3...)

Pretty Good.  Made recipe exactly as recipe stated.  The only advise I could give is to fill muffin tin fuller than normal because the muffins do not rise that much while baking.  Will definately make again!

This is a nice, dense muffin.  I actually made this the first time with chocolate chips (because that's what I had) and I did not like them at all.  The texture and flavors don't work.  So I tried again with blueberries and that's the way they're supposed to be!  I used 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown sugar but otherwise made as written. Quite yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly and the muffins are great!  My son who has a list of about 5 things he likes to eat, loves them! (minus the blueberries)  As I type he is on his second muffin!  I would double the recipe next time though because it only made 10 muffins.

These are okay, but for some reason they did not rise for me. I did not overmix the batter. I also used pumpkin pie spice and if I had it to do over again I would use the spices the recipe called for, and a bit more sugar (I did use Splenda blend). So, I did not follow the recipe exactly, but cannot figure out why they did not rise.

These were great, but I did change a few things.  I used half brown and half white sugar, and also used half white and half whole wheat flour.  I also put the blueberries in while they were still frozen, so they wouldn't turn my batter purple or get bruised while I was mixing.  I didn't put in all the nutmeg, and I think next time I will put in even less, because it seemed to overpower the cinnamon and the pumpkin flavor a bit.  I made a few muffins with mini chocolate chips instead of the blueberries, and those were also really good, they rose higher and looked more appealing.  But great, either way.

Absolutely yummy muffins.  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and a 1/4 cup of all purpose and substituted the sugar with the brown sugar splenda blend and it turned out great.  I made a second batch last night and didn't have enough splenda so I used a tbsp of Agave and they turned out good as well.  I'm thinking of replacing the sugar entirely with Agave next time and seeing how it turns out.  I also want to make these 100% whole wheat but fear that they might turn out dry so we'll see.  Either way, these are total keepers and will make them again and again.  PS. Substituting the flour and the sugar also lowered the calories on these muffins.

I was a little leary of putting pumkin with blueberries, but they worked out great!  My kid's loved them!  I thought the amount of pumpkin ang spices was just right!  Thanks for the recipe I will be putting this one in my permanent recipe collection.

I wasn't a fan of these muffins.
If I were to try to make these again, I would decrease the amount of pumpkin.

very good recipe, easy to make.  I doubled the recipe so my dad wouldn't eat all them. The blueberry made it extra yummy, but I would use less spice next time.

Awesome! I made it all low fat and "healthy" I used splenda and whole wheat flour and smart balance butter. Added some walnuts and it was perfecto!

Excellent!  I used frozen blueberries without a problem for the first batch...then realized when I made them again (because they were so awesome) that I didn't have anymore frozen, so I used dehydrated blueberries, which weren't too bad either.  I had so many requests for this recipe..it's tasty and healthy!!!

Delicious recipe as is (Although I may have been generous with the blueberries.)  Made these for company and everyone enjoyed them!
