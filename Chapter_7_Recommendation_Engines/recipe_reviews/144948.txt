Between reading the reviews and my own experience, I found this clearly is a recipe that needs to be worked with to get it to suit your tastes - and I guess I "worked" with it a lot. For me, I found it a tad heavy on the mayonnaise and light on the seasoning. I added Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt, Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning and a fair amount of salt and pepper, which definitely helped brighten the flavor.  As for the too much mayo issue, I'm hoping it might be better tomorrow after it has a chance to set overnight and absorb some of the excess.  Further, I agree with other reviewers on a couple of points - one, that the tomato isn't a good choice, particularly if this is going to be made ahead of time, so I left it out - but I threw in some frozen peas instead, which I feel is a far better choice. I also agree that farfalle (pasta in the shape of bow ties) is a nice choice,  so I used that instead of the seashell pasta, not that it wouldn't have been good too.  Canned shrimp is kind of salty and mushy, so I used frozen, pre-cooked shrimp instead.  I used fresh green onion instead of the shallots because I believe the taste and bite of the shallots would have been overpowering.  The recipe on its own is perhaps a good base recipe or, if left as it stands, fairly nondescript and ordinary.  Four stars with changes like mine, or your own that appeal to you and your tastebuds.

This is good recipe but use frozen shrimp not canned! If possible, AVOID shrimp that has been peeled and deveined before freezing. It may cause a loss of flavor and texture (the shells help to protect the meat of the shrimp). I used an entire bag of U36/40 sized shrimp b/c I like a bigger shrimp in my salads.  I adjusted the quantities of the veggies in the recipe to 1 c. of celery, 1 c. of cucumber, 4 small tomatoes (which I seeded) and 5 TBS of shallots. I would recommend Farfalle (bow tie) pasta instead of shells and I used more like 12 oz. Shells just seems to trap dressing which can be good or bad depending on your sensibilities. I adjusted the dressing too by adding a TBS of Worchestershire sauce and more dill but quantity wise there was plenty of dressing even with the increases in veggies and pasta.  This salad needs generous amounts of salt and pepper but all in all it's very tasty.

My FIL brought up shrimp salad last week, and when he brought it up, it sounded so good to me. It used to be my favorite dish. We bought the ingredients and they cost about $22.00, however, we have a slew of fresh produce and pasta left over for another meal.  Considering the spaghetti dish the other night cost much more at the store, I was happy. 
My husband demands Miracle Whip, so we did not use the mayo. I added another can of shrimp, cut back on the lemon, used dried dill (1/2 Tb) and only used 1 tomato, and 1 medium cuke. 
It's a nice medley of taste and texture. I could have added more dill, but know that the dish will age over the next two hours, and the 1/2 Tb will be sufficient. Thanks for sharing this recipe, and I hope to find many more recipes to try...

I made this salad for our branding and everyone wants me to bring it to theirs. I make it with the Bow Tie noodles. I make the salad a day ahead of time and make extra dressing because it absorbs into the salad.  I also add the tomatoes the next day. I use the big frozen shrimp instead of canned. I thought it needed a little something and all that was some celery salt! It just gets better and better the longer it sets so I am thinking about making it a couple days ahead of time! There is not too much of anything so I don't know what anyone is complaining about....must not like mayo! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent!  I used 1/2 c. fat free plain yogurt and 1/2 c. low fat mayo instead of 1 c. mayo.  I used the larger frozen shrimp and cut them in 1/2.  Next time, I'll use grape tomatoes, cut in half.  Thanks for posting!

I used fresh everything from my greenhouse (dill, cukes, tomatoes, onions) and made this for an annual BBQ at my home.  FANTASTIC flavor.  I used LOTS of bigger shrimp instead of canned ones.  Also, the amount of dressing was perfect for a batch and a half (my box of pasta was 13oz).

I made this as written, but next time I would change a few things. I would double the pasta, double the dressing, double the shrimp and double everything else because you just want more and more! Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

This was pretty good.  Not as good as the deli near my house, though.  I used the small canned shrimp, as per recipe, and they were miniscule.  I would definitely go with a larger shrimp next time.  Also, when I was making the dressing, I thought a cup of mayo was going to be too much, so I started with a half a cup (left everything else the same), and it was perfect.  I also ommited the tomatoes, because I didn't think they'd last well in the salad after the first day.  One last thing, I'm not sure how much I liked the lemon in this.  I love lemon, but if you plan to eat the salad right away, the lemon is over-powering.  After a day or two, it's much better.  Thanks.

I made this in a hurry and let it chill for a couple hours and with a couple alterations it was pretty good. I used tuna instead of shrimp as it was what I had on hand. Also skipped the cucumber and tomato. Otherwise followed it and everyone was really happy. I likely used double the dill as I wasn't using a measuring cup but more dill is so so good!!

I did enjoy this, but it lacked a little "something", not sure what. Maybe more dill and lemon? Or maybe some celery salt and more black pepper? Definitely a recipe that could EASILY be tweeked to personal preferences.

Lots of fresh dill really added to the yum factor of this salad :-d
Since I didn't have shrimp, I used salad-style imitation lobster.

Pretty good! I added more dill, did not use a full cup of mayo, and doubled the amount of the veggies.  I also added some chopped pickles for a nice zinggy crunch.  Will make again!

This is a wonderful salad.  I didn't care for the shrimp but I can see that seafood would be wonderful in this dish.  I will try it again but make a protein substitution.

If you tweek the basic ingredients to your taste and use frozen shrimp, it's a delicious seafood salad!

This salad had a good flavor but was not a knockout.  I used frozen shrimp instead of the canned.  I will make this again.

Is better the next day...  I kept trying a bite here and there the day I made it and the flavor was odd.  I added 1/4 C diced onion and 1 T Worchester sauce for more flavor and it turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a football tailgate and everyone loved it.  It went great with our burgers and hot dogs.  It's the 2nd time I've made it and I'll definitely make it for other events.  I might even make it again and keep it for myself!

Slightly modified the recipe: used frozen salad shrimp (never used canned) and frozen peas because I could. Used a different shaped pasta as it was on hand. Didn't have celery and will be sure to have it next time as I was missing the little crunch it adds. Left out the tomatoes as I don't like them mixed in salads. Seems too saucy at first but the pasta absorbs it over time. Like most pasta salads, tastes better the next day when the flavors have time to blend.

This was perfect salad for a light lunch. My sister loved it. Confession, I did use frozen cooked salad shrimp instead of canned.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   This recipe was a “10” in my family.  Everyone simply enjoyed this dish and a lucky few were able to get “seconds.”  Which means the next time I make it I will double the ingredients.  This dish will definitely be in the monthly family rotation of meals in the future.

The first time I made it exactly as written. Delicious. I've made it two more times for family functions adding  crab meat and yellow bell pepper. I use grape tomatoes. Will make this every summer! Thanks for sharing!

Very good, even though I had to use dried dill. The sour cream gives it a fresher, lighter flavor than mayo alone.
