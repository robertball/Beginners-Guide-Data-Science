Tried with a a splash of grapefruit juice instead of lime and it was amazingly delicious. I don't think you can go wrong on this.

All I can say is WOW!!!  This tequila cocktail is awesome.  Similar to a Margarita but more refreshing!  I made a pitcher of the Palomas and my Cinco de Mayo was a success.  I will be making this drink again.
