fabulous... I have tried many many different dressing/stuffing recipes. This is by far the very best. I used Granny Smith apples

This is the most awesome dressing!!! This is the first time that I made a dressing from scratch, and though my  husband is not a big fan of dressing... when I made this for thanksgiving '09, he loved it and said this is the one. (it's the only one he'll eat now.) And though I never buy fresh herbs, I used 1/3 the portion of dried and used a mix of walnuts and pecans. It's definitely worth the effort to make your own bread crumbs. If you're looking to impress anyone with an incredible dressing...."THIS IS THE ONE!!" (I can't say it enough!...WOW!!!)

I doubled this reciipe and glad I did! Was the best dressing I've ever made!  Left out the liver, used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage and extra chicken stock & extra bread crumbs. Everyone raved about the flavor!  This is definately a keeper.  Double or triple the recipe, you'll definately want leftovers!  I think it would even be better had I added Pecans!

I made Thanksgiving dinner for the first time yesterday for the inlaws and this dressing was AMAZING.  The only thing I did different was use 1 package of corbread mix and included that in the 10 cups of bread.  Not sure if that changed anything but I will def be making this again!

This stuffing was AMAZING!  I am definitely making this for thanksgiving.  Only note: I made a 1/4 of the recipe and did not decrease the cooking time, so it was a little drier than traditional stuffing.  I actually liked it drier (my husband wished for it to be a little more moist), but I might increase the amount of stock and keep and eye on it when I make it for thanksgiving.  I also used pre-packaged bread crumbs.

I have used this Recipe for a couple of years.  I love it. The one tweak I make is to use ground turkey instead of pork sausage.  Awesome!!!

I made this for Christmas dinner, increased the recipe by 50% (except for the butter) and so increased the cooking time somewhat.  All my guests raved about this dressing.  My husband told me, "I wouldn't be disappointed if you made this dressing for every holiday dinner for the rest of our lives."  Definitely going in my box of favorite recipes to use again and again.  Thanks a TON, Alan!

Made this dressing to take home for a visit with my sons.  They are young, so they are picky.  I wasn't sure the cranberries would be a hit in the dressing, but each of them loved it.  I would suggest a bit more chicken stock however and less apples.  Since I already had a sausage with sage in it (Neese's), I left out the additional and it worked out well with the flavor.  This recipe made more than enough for 5 adults.  I will be making this again when it's time to visit our parents. :)  Thank you for posting.

My whole family rated this recipe the BEST dressing they've ever had!! Thank you for sharing this!! I didn't add the egg because my niece is allergic to eggs, but I did everything else according to instructions and it couldn't have turned out better! Make sure you have a hurry crowd as this makes a lot....each bite YUMMY!!

I'm from the Midwest and grew up on "yankee" stuffing. When I moved to Georgia I looked for a recipe that came close to what we always had and this was it. I left out the nuts (I'm allergic) and took this to a thanksgiving party where everyone considered cornbread stuffing to be traditional and it was a huge hit!

If you are looking for a savory stuffing that has a nice crunch this is for you. We used potato bread instead of the traditional white bread. We will definitely make this again!!

Make extra and hide it.  This dressing was a smash during Christmas dinner this year.  I decided against cranberry sauce, so it was great to have them in the dressing.

This was soooo good!  I used Hot Bob Evans sausage but I think that is the only thing I changed. I rarely big 5's but I love dressing and this is the best.

This was yummy. When I make it again, I will either use bread crumbs or try to chop the bread into smaller cubes..... That is the only thing I would change.

So so delicious! I used fresh sourdough bread, so I toasted it a little longer. I think next time I would try cutting the bread cubes a little smaller. It was still delicious with biggish chunks though. So many compliments.

Wish I could give it 4.5 stars.  Dressing is my favorite traditional Thanksgiving dish.  I attempted to make it many years ago and it didn't turn out well.  I am so pleased to say that, with this recipe, I can make delicious dressing.  Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I think the seasonings need to be increased.

This was amazing it was so moist. I made a double batch for Thanksgiving we had over 30 people.  A few was hesitant because you don't put fruit in stuffing but after trying it they loved it.

This is my second Thanksgiving making this stuffing, everyone LOVED it! I will be hosting two new guests this year and I'm sure I'll receive compliments on the stuffing!
