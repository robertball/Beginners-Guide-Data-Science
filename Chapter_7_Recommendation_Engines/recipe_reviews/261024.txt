Liked it very much as is. Pur√©ed until smooth. Will keep using, maybe with some extra basil next time.

This was fantastik! Ewven my husband said it. I with the recipe have a serving size. I poured it into 6 separate containers to get a serving. I think it's about 4.5 oz per serving. I used 2 and froze the other 4 as 2 servings. Awsome!

This is my new favorite sauce!  So quick and easy to make! I cooked it in a pot and used a hand mixer to blend it so that I could have it a little chunky.   For my personal tastes I would add minced garlic.   You can also add heavy whipping cream to give it a different flavor.

It is pretty good. Next time I will decrease the garlic powder in half and add a bit more salt.
