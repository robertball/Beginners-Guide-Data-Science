This is very similar to the dish we've been making in our family for years, I know ppl hate when otheres do this, but i didnt follow exactly.  But then i rarely follow a recipe exactly.  THe way i made this is, with the cut pork i placed in a saucepan, slightly covered with water, and simmered with salt until all water evaporated(it makes the pork more tender) Once all evaporated I added veg oil, onion and jalapeno(with seeds cuz we like it hot) and salt pepper, garlic powder, cumin, oregano. let fry until browned, I added 2 small roma tomatoes coarsely chopped and about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce(im sure it would work great with the diced tomatoes like the recipe calls for, I just didnt have any) I let cook until tomatoes were tender, I added about 1/4 -1/2 cup of water, and let simmer together. I didnt add mushrooms because my husband doesnt like them,but it sure sounds good though.

We made this in the crock pot with two cans of tomatoes and jalapenos instead of the fresh jalapenos, and we really like it. We've already made twice, once to eat in tortillas, and once we shredded the meat and used it for chilaquiles. Yum!

Why would someone leave a review without making the recipe.  If the pic is not pleasing...move on.  The TASTE was excellent.

Years ago I got a very similar recipe from a Mexican lady. She called it Chilosa.This version has no mushrooms, more tomatoes,and is spooned over rice and loaded into unfried corn tortillas for eating. Yummo.

Amazing dish! I did what another poster said and pretty much boiled the pork rather than fry it. Then continued the recipe as normal. The way I serve it is different. Instead of over rice or anything, I love it wrapped in a tortilla with cheese and sour cream.

This recipe was easy to follow, and the end result quite good.  I added a little cornstarch towards the end to thicken the sauce, and we ate it with tortillas...very good!

The house smells wonderful because I made this in the crock pot today.  I made this pretty much to recipe but without the mushrooms and my husband really loved it.  We had it in tortillas with sour cream, cheese, guacomole lettuce.  Good recipe Amy_S.

Made this with pork tenderloin and serrano chilis as that's what I had on hand. Tweaked the seasonings a little and simmered for about an hour until the meat was melt-in-the-mouth tender. Turned out great - very hearty and flavorful. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I added a bell pepper which gave it a nice flavor. Wrapped it in a tortilla and ate it like a soft taco.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe and decided to cook exactly as directed.  I do like really spicy foods but but for my family after simmering the peppers with the pork mixture I only returned one of the chopped peppers (without seeds) to the tomato mixture.  I plated with white rice, and offered the following condiments: mozzarella cheese, salsa and I reserved half of jalapenos for the table for those who want to kick it up a little. Really happy with the way it turned out and will cook it again soon.  Thanks Amy for sharing.

I made this yesterday, and it was awesome. I took one reviewer's suggestion to tenderize the pork by simmering it first. I knew it would take awhile, so started tenderizing it early in the day. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and we really enjoyed it. I served it over rice. Will make this again, for sure! Nice cheap dish and heavenly aroma!

Excellent recipe!  Just be sure the pork is cut into bite-sized pieces and make sure there is enough liquid.  I would have added another 1/4 teaspoon of cumin but my partner said a 1/2 teaspoon was enough.

Not bad! Both my hubs and I really enjoyed this, although the heat factor was a bit of an issue for me.... I like spicy food, but this was WICKED spicy lol! NOTE TO SELF: ONLY USE 1 JALAPENO NEXT TIME (or remove the seeds from one of them to cut some of the spice)!!!!! I usually follow the submitter's cooking / preparation directions to the letter (unless they seem contradictory, erroneous or I feel I can improve or streamline the process), but will often times make ingredient substitutions to suit my tastes. This time, not only did I make a few personal adjustments, I also altered the cooking method - and I wish I wouldn't have.... :( As wifeyluvs2cook did, I simmered my pork (to tenderize it) before proceeding with the recipe as directed. I'm not sure where I went wrong, but my pork ended up VERY tough. I am a fan of wifey's recipes and her cooking style, but this time her advice didn't work for me. I STRONGLY suggest that you follow Amy's directions, at least initially. You can always make changes next time. Having said this, wifey's suggestion to add a pinch of garlic powder / oregano was spot on (both added great flavor, IMHO). her suggestion to substitute fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce and water also worked well, so if you don't have canned tomatoes, don't sweat it. Steamed rice, refried beans and corn tortillas completed our meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Amy! I can't wait to make this again, albeit after my mouth cools off a bit haha! :-)

This was real tasty, but I opted to omit the peppers since i cant eat spicy. My kids made tacos out of them, but I made a bowl:. Spanish rice with a side of the pork sprinkled with Monterey Jack cheese.  Yum!

This was another really easy recipe that turned out great. The pork came out nicely browned but also nice and tender. We made a few modifications that were also good. Fried potatoes in place of rice and fresh tomatoes and mushrooms. If you use fresh tomatoes you should boil and peel them, just FYI. Next time we're going to try habaneros!

(Warning: comments not for  sticklers of following recipe exactly to rate it!) I think this would have been a bit bland if followed exactly. Used  1-3/4 lb. pork stew cut in chunks &  followed advice of reviewer to simmer in water.  Dumped rest of ingredients in & simmered, adjusting seasoning & ingredients to our tastes.  Didn't use: mushrooms,  jalapenos. For the 12 oz. can tomatoes, substituted: 1-10-oz.  can mild spicy diced tomatoes (Rotel) + 1/2 cup salsa. Added: 1 can garbanzo beans, drained.  After all was cooked, adjusted liquid level & seasoning for 1 1/2 cups instant brown rice; covered. Cooked 15 minutes.

This recipe is a keeper.  I used pork tenderloin, browning it in the oil before putting it in a crock pot along with the rest of the ingredients.  I did add an extra can of tomatoes and seeded the jalapenos to keep the heat down.  The pork was falling apart tender and just spicy enough for us.  The leftovers will make fantastic tacos tomorrow night.  We loved it!

My wife and I loved it!  It will definitely be saved in our recipe book.

We poured it over white rice cooked with beef bouillon.  It was delicious.

I added 2 cups of fresh brown mushrooms with the onions and left the can of mushrooms. Also used deboned pork chops. This is a keeper

Pretty good! Could use a bit more flavor, either from salt, lard, knorr (I know....) or maybe more garlic...idk. That is my opinion though. The kids and hubby LOVED it and didn't have any negative comments!
