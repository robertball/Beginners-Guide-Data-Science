Over the years I had lost this recipe and was so happy to find it here!  One thing I do that solves the problem of too much frosting is I make the hole for the cherry larger so it takes more frosting, and then after baking I spread another spoon or so on top of the baked cookies,this makes them prettier and uses all the frosting, plus they are really scrummy with the extra frosting.  The uncooked frosting that you put on the warm cookies after baking is just as good as the first that is spread on before baking.  These cookies rock, they are the BEST cookie there is, if you like chocolate and cherries you will LOVE this cookie.  :)  P.S. I also sometimes add an extra egg, this makes the cookies soft and chewy, I like them better this way.

I just recently made these and they were fantastic! I assumed that the directions to add the frosting to the cookie before baking was incorrect but it's not and the cookie and frosting turn out great! For the last sheet I added marshmellows to the center of the thumbprint instead of cherries and covered with the frosting! These are incredibly good and remind me of the cookies we get at the mall.
These will definitely be made again and join my Christmas cookie trays.

These are fabulous! Tried frosting the cookies before & after baking.  The cookies are much better if you wait to drizzle them post baking. And FYI:  the icing makes triple the amount that you actually need.  You could easily cut it in half and have plenty. Don't hesitate to make these.  They're wonderful!

What a decadent delight! I loved these cookies and I will certainly make them again. The cookies were delicious and attractive. I took them to a bake sale and many people asked for the recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a few changes: 1) doubled the batter but not the chocolate sauce, 2) used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar, 3) placed the cherry in the center of the cookie immediately after I took them out of the oven, and 4) drizzled the chocolate on after the cookie cooled. I also cut the cherries in half before inserting them into the center just to stretch the jar of cherries. (I'm glad I did or I would have run out of cherries.)The only problem I encountered was that my cookie dough was too soft and sticky to roll because the overzealous cherry lover in me added a little too much cherry juice to the batter. I remedied that by just dropping the batter onto the cookie sheet like a drop cookie, then using a spoon to "swirl" them into a round shape.

I've been making this cookie for years!  They get stale REALLY fast, so I freeze them soon after they cool.  I put them in a tupperware container with wax paper between the layers.  They don't freeze rock-hard - you can eat right from the freezer!!!

Lovely cookies, good flavor. I tripled the batch and made 1/3 of these cookies without the cherries in them, and they were a hit even without the fruit. With the fruit they were sensational as well. Be careful though not to get any of the choc. chip/condensed milk mixture off of the cookies themselves. if you let that mixture touch the cookie sheet, it tastes rather like burnt marshmallows (a taste I am not fond of!).

These truly are yummy cookies, and like other reviews, the frosting yields so much, that you'll have enough to spoon a teaspoon onto each cookie instead of just drizzling it.  Another hint, the frosting is not very cherry-flavored, and doubling or tripling the cherry juice in the frosting will improve the cherry flavor, but not compromise the thickness of the frosting.

Good enough.  The frosting did not have enough cherry in it and the cookie alone (once the cherry was gone) was no big deal.  I will make again putting some cherry juice in the cookie and a lot more in the frosting (which I drizzled on after baked).  Good concept though!

These cookies are soooo yummy!!!  I added an extra egg like someone else had suggested and they are so chewy!  They have a great chocolatey-fudgey taste.  My cookies kind of spread out when they baked, instead of staying small and plump, but they still taste great.  I'll be making these many more times to come!  Thanks for the recipe!

I first found this recipe in a Better Homes and Gardens years ago, and then lost it.  I've been trying to find it ever since then.  I was so surpirsed to find it here.  
These are wonderful, rich, moan-inspiring cookies.  They get better after sitting in a tin for a week or so, since the chocolate topping sinks into the cookie and the cherry flavor becomes more intense.  
I add more cherry juice to the chocolate topping to thin it and then add a little extra to the cookies after they come out of the oven.  
Kids would enjoy eating these messy treats with a hidden cherry.  Making them would be kid-friendly, too, except for the chocolate topping, which can get dangerously hot.

I felt compelled to rate this recipe because of all the great reviews it received. First off - the recipe is very poorly written and I'm surprised it passed the All Recipes review process - the yield states 18 cookies?  I got 5 dozen - and followed the receipe exactly as written. They taste like a mediocre chocolate cookie with a cherry stuck in the middle.  I used Ghirardelli cocoa and that didnt' help at all.  The frosting makes ENTIRELY too much - I have at least a cup and half left over.  The cookies stick to the sheets if even a drop of the frosting overflows and the cookie then falls apart.  You might want to mention that they need to cool for a minute or two before attempting to remove them at all - but don't let them cool too much or they will stick to the pan and fall apart when trying to remove them.  Horrible recipe and a very bland cookie.  Sorry but this is the worst recipe I've ever tried from this site and I've used this site almost daily for close to 8 years!

I have tasted many of these cookies over the years at cookie swaps  etc... They are beautiful... BUT... I have never really liked them because they were always dry tasting. So this year I decided I would make an attempt at making this cookie for my Christmas parties. After mixing up the dough as written my dough was very thick and very dry. I panicked because I didn't want a dry cookie so I changed up the recipe a little. I am very pleased with the end results. I came up with the following. I added almond flavoring in place of vanilla. I added about a 1/2c. or so of cherry juice to the batter. I didn't measure. The batter was really dry before I added the cherry juice. Now my dough is sticky! Then I used a small stainless steel scoop and made little chocolate mounds on my cookie sheet. Then I pushed a cherry in the top. When pushing the cherry it flattens the mound a tiny bit. I crossed my fingers that they hold their shape while baking and didn't run everywhere. Wha-la!!!! They were perfect! I let them cool a little on the stone I cooked them on, then transfered to a cooling rack. When completely cooled I made the icing. I did add cherry juice to it as well probably a 1/4 to 1/2 cup. I didn't measure. The icing was still a good consistency, not runny. I poured it into a squeeze bottle after I melted the icing ingredients on my stove top. It was very easy to  drizzle the icing on my cookies using a squeeze bottle. The end result was fantastic. They look beautiful. They are mo

This is the exact recipe that I have been using for years.  The difference is that my recipe makes 48 cookies, not 18. That is why so many reviewers have so much of the chocolate icing leftover.  I roll the dough into 48 balls, then make the depression in them for the cherry.  The larger ratio of cookie dough to cherry and chocolate is probably why some reviewers think this is a bland cookie, also.  The cookies should be small so you can pop the whole thing in your mouth and get all the flavor at once. Oh...BTW...you might need more than one jar of cherries depending on what size cherries they are.

Adding the extra egg makes a big difference. As does adding about 1/8c. of cherry juice to the cookie dough. Another way I make these is: You can chop up the cherries and put them right into the cookie dough. I also add finely chopped walnuts. Then make small balls and roll them in confectioners sugar. Make an indent in the cookie and fill it with the icing. Ohhh YUMM! This cookie has it ALL!!!

This cookie is probably a 5 star cookie if the recipe is followed.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and things didn't turn out so well!  First-a second egg will make these cookies more cake like.  I made a double batch using 4 eggs and did not like the texture of the cookie at all!  Second-definately put the cherry into the cookie before baking!  I tried both ways, before and after.  You will get a better looking cookie if you put it in before baking.  I put 1/2 cherry into the center of each cookie-no thumbprint.  The whole cherry was overwelming to the cookie.  Third-I iced my cookies after baking.  The icing never dried- that must be the reason for baking the icing with the cookie!  I made a double batch of cookies and a single batch of icing and still had way too much icing.  I used a metal spoon and slowly drizzled the icing over the cookies.  On my first batch of icing, I used evaporated milk-big mistake!  The cookies did turn out beautiful and tasty.  I'm hoping the icing will dry with time.  They have been done for 1/2 hr.   I will use the leftover icing as a topping for ice cream!

so, i've been making these for a few years, and haven't had a problem baking them with the frosting. if it melts too much, i just re-apply a little frosting after they're out of the oven.

my tweaks: add a few teaspoonfuls of the cherry juice to cookie batter, and replace an 1/4 c. of flour with a 1/4 cup ground up pecans(gives moisture and nutty flavor). also, i use brown sugar in lieu of white sugar, and i use whole cherries. this is a very rich cookie, and i recommend keeping any leftovers in the fridge.

These turned out super yummy. But I am giving it 4 stars because I baked mine differently from the directions given. I followed the recipe for the dough as is and added in about a tbsp of the cherry juice to the dough. I then greased up a mini muffin tin and measured out 1 tbsp of dough, wrapped a cherry in it and put it into the muffin cup. Baked for the specified 10 mins and it was perfect. As soon as I took it out the oven I made an indent in the center and spooned in the fudge mixture (which I still had leftovers from) then I topped with half maraschino cherry and some sprinkles for presentation. Overall the cookie is good, I feel the chocolate flavour is good enough to match the cherry flavour. Not too rich. I immediately stored these in the freezer after reading another review about how they go bad quickly (and I got way more cookies than the recipe specifies) They are so delicious straight from the freezer. Definitely a cookie I look forward to making again. Thanks for sharing.

Mmmm, so good! The only change I made was to make a deeper hole for the cherry and fill it with the chocolate mixture first. After putting the cherry on top of that, I drizzled more chocolate. Turned out great!

Insanely good! So glad I doubled the cookie recipe (kept the icing at original recipe size)!!  Did add the extra egg, did half white / half brown sugar, added a tsp of Almond Extract, and added some cherry juice into the cookie batter (didn't measure, just poured it on it).  For the icing, I used a full half cup of cherry juice.   As for the cherry itself:  I rolled the dough into a ball, flattened it and made an indent with my thumb.  Dropped a bit of icing there, to hold the cherry in place - and baked.  Then, I did put icing into a baggie and piped it onto the baked cookies.  These are going to "WOW" the staff for the Teacher Appreciation Dinner this week!

I just made a batch to see if they will be added to my Christmas cookie list. After reading the reviews, I made a few changes.  First I doubled the recipe. I used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 light brown sugar. I poured about 1/2 the jar of cherry juice in & chopped the cherries, adding them to the dough and lastly I added mini chips.  I skipped the frosting in this recipe and will make my own vanilla glaze so I can sprikle with red & white sanding sugar.  The cookies came out very chocolatey & brownie-like.  The dough was too mushy to roll into balls so I used a cookie scoop which worked out perfectly.  I will add this one to my cookie list!

The dough tastes great (they're in the oven right now). There is WAY too much sauce. Cut it down to 25% (1/8 cup of condensed milk and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips).

These were a big hit at work!  I did what other reviewers suggested and added a little cherry juice to the cookie batter.  I also halved the frosting recipe and still had quite a bit leftover (I pipped the frosting like the picture shows).  The only adjustment I will make next time is adding more cherry juice to the cookie batter.  Great recipe!

An excellent cookie that is attractive as well.  I ended up with 36 cookies by following the recipe, except I cut the cherries in half...whole cherries are a bit large for these cookies I think.

I was looking for a new cookie recipe that would contain cherries, since they are a favorite of my husband's.  I made the recipe exactly as is, and was so surprised that the frosting didn't run all over while baking on the cookie.  The cookies were delicious; I believe they will be requested again very soon.  Since there was leftover frosting, we refrigerated it and reheated at a later date, using it as a fondue with fresh berries.  Thanks for the recipe.

Overall, a good cookie. Certainly a pretty presentation! We did 2 versions: one with the cherry baked on top, the other with the cherry added after baking. A mellower flavor baked on, but not nearly as pretty. I loved how bright the cherry was when it wasn't baked, but some people might not love the flavor as much...so it's all a matter of preference. Also, we used a half cherry on each. And there is WAY more icing than you need... which can be used for other treats (ice cream topping?!?).

These are really good cookies, I made these last year to add to my Christmas cookie platters. These made a nice addition, but I did drizzle the chocolate topping using a small plastic bottle used for candy making. These turned out much prettier than topping the entire cherry with the chocolate. I also recommend shaping these into balls all at once and making the indent, because as the dough sat, when I tried to make thumbprint, the edges of the cookies seemed to "crack". That's fine, but again, they are much more attractive  with smooth edges. Everyone that loves chocolate covered cherries will love this cookie for sure! Thanks for sharing :)

These are absolutely delicious! I'm just starting to get the swing of baking, and I was pleasantly shocked to realize how easy it was to make my cookies look just as pretty as the ones in the picture. I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers: I added an extra egg to make them chewy, I drizzled the topping before and after baking, and I froze the majority of my batch. I also added cherry juice to the batter itself, and countered it by adding about a fourth of a cup of extra flour. The dough was still a bit too sticky, so I stuck it in the fridge for about 15 minutes, and that made the balls super easy to make. Also, after I made the topping I put it into a ziploc bag and cut the tiniest hole in one corner, then chilled it while the cookies were baking. Then, after the cookies cooled, all I had to do was pipe the cold frosting on, and voila! A beautiful, flavorful, chewy cookie. My boyfriend and neighbors loved them. Thank you Jamie for a magical recipe!

I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it and then adjust.  I thought the flavor was great.  However, as I was making these I was concerned there was too much flour and indeed they came out dry.  I will definitely make these again but with less flour.  1 cup to possibly 1 1/4 cup flour would be more than enough for the amount of butter and eggs.  Like others said I will probably add more cherry flavoring.  Otherwise, this is a great new recipe.  Thanks!

These are great, but one caution no one mentioned.  Do not let the frosting touch the ungreased cookie sheet!  It will cook on like cement!  Do save some frosting for after they come out of the oven.  Keep cookies small so they don't break.  Ultra yummy and attractive.

Awesome!  I honestly don't like chocolate covered cherries--I made them for my husband because he does.  But these cookies were great!  I added about 1/4 cup of cherry juice to the dough to make it a little more workable--it was a bit too stiff without.

The afternoon I baked these I was thinking they earned a four, but after sitting a few days (like true chocolate covered cherries) they get a solid five. In future attempts I might try adding an extra egg to the dough as coming out it was kind of dry, but then I'd worry they might fall apart after a couple days because as-written after sitting the cherry kind of settles into and makes the cookie moist. It'll probably be decided by the timeframe I'll be serving: these are for the holidays so I appreciate the heartiness. I did pipe the icing on before baking as written with no problems. Piped, not spooned, which in hindsight created more work and didn't really look any better IMO. The icing isn't strongly cherry flavored, but it tastes rich and fudgy which I think pairs better with the whole cherry in the cookie so I won't make any changes there either. A definite repeat recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

These cookies are very good.  Very chocolately.  But I don't think they taste like chocolate covered cherries all that much (so I took away a star).  The dough scared me a little because it didn't want to come together at first and looked very dry and crumbly, but after a bit more mixing, it turned into a nice, soft dough that formed easily into balls.  The picky hubby approves, too!

This was excellent- they came out perfect. I did do the one thing that others suggested and that was filling the hole with frosting before topping it with the cherry. I did not drizzle additional frosting on top when it came out because the frosting never got very hard and I would not have been able to stack them in the cookie tin. They were excellent and will make for my next cookie exchange.

This dough freezes excellent! I made the recipe with 2 eggs (this was a little sticky) but the cookie is out of this world delicious! I made the frosting as is. I let this cool, and spooned into a ziploc bag and cut the edge. I frosted before I cooked, and after I cooked. My husband loves this straight from the fridge. I passed these out to neighbors and friends for Valentine's Day, in cellophane bags with two finger prints in the shape of a heart. The easist 'gift' I've ever made! And there is 20+ cookies leftover for us! I handed out 10 cookies! I made melon ball size cookies. Will be making these year round. YUM! Thank you!

I would call these brownie bites, instead of cookies.  It is the consistency of a brownie.  The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I put the chocolate glaze on after the cookies cooled a bit in the fridge and did so by putting the warm chocolate sauce with LOTS of cherry juice mixed in inside a ziplock bag and cut a very small tip off the bottom so it would easily decorate the cookies.  Mine looked identical to the pic on the front page of the recipe.  I HATE cherry anything, so I made these for my boyfriend for early vday present.  I have already eaten 12!!!!!!  I'm on a diet too and I cannot get enough!  These are to die for!!  I keep them stored in a fridge for a cold chewy gooey treat.  
Don't change the recipe, leave as is except for putting the chocolate on top once they are cooled.  Only cook for 8 minutes if you decide to do bite size cookies.  For a normal size cookie go the full 10 min.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's yummy!

This is one amazing tasting cookie!!!  I recommend doubling the cookie ingredients so you can make use of all the frosting this recipe makes.  Even then I had some frosting left.  Just make sure you get a larger jar of cherries because the 10 oz. size only has enough for about 20 cookies.  Keep the cherry juice on hand.  I had to add quite a bit more to keep the frosting a good spreading consistency throughout the process.  I made them for Valentine's Day and not only are they very festive looking, they taste amazing!  They did not last long in my house.

I ended up making two batches of these cookies because I had so much chocolate and cherries left over after the first batch.  I was leary of frosting the cookies before baking them; I was afraid the chocolate would run all over.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  The frosting stayed on the cookies and they were delicious.

Wow these are great and definately a recipe to hang on to! My dad loves chocolate covered cherries so I made these for his birthday. They were a big hit. The cookies are soft and tasted like brownies and the cordial mixture that you spread over the cherries is yummalicous. You will lick the bowl :) I melted some white chocolate to drizzle over the top.

I took other reviewers advice, some changes I made were, 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, a few teaspoons of cherry juice to the cookie dough, and the dough was not at all crumbly or dry. Neither were the cookies. After trying all the different ways to make them, I think that they are WAY prettier if you bake the cookies plain, smush a cherry into them right out of the oven, and then drizzle or cover with the chocolate. These were a HUGE hit with my husband, and I liked them a lot too. I will for sure make them again, and always put the cherries/chocolate on after the cookies bake.

I am giving this recipe a 5 because they are simply the best!  Fairly easy to make.  The frosting/topping stays in place even in the oven.  I was nervous, but it stays right where you put it and doesn't spread or run. I used whole cherries but they looked a little smaller than I have boughten before.  The cookie part is so chocolatly and chewy.  My husband is in heaven!  Thanks!

I'm crazy about this recipe . . . however!! I've made it 2 times and the cookie has come out different both times. // The first time the "batter" was more grainy, like moist sand. It still formed into a ball, but after baking the cookie was sturdy but gritty from the sugar -- still tasted great. // The second time I beat the sugar and butter longer, and then beat in the remaining dry ingredients longer until it became more like soft clay. After baking the cookie was not as sturdy, but more cake-like and fell apart when lifting it from the cookie sheet. Additionally, the frosting the second time around spread more than the first time...don't understand that. //// I'll continue to make this cookie until I nail it down simply because I loved making them, sharing them, and eating them. ////// Attention Jamie Langston: if you're out there I'd welcome your insight as to what I've done wrong!!

I found this recipe here last year and made them again this year. I love this recipe. I made them yesterday and one thing I did different this year with the icing was that I melted the chocolate morsels and sweetened condensed milk in the microwave. I didn't let it get too hot, just enough to melt the morsels and stir it together. I only added a few teaspoons of the cherry juice so it wouldn't get too thin. Then I put the icing a little at a time in a pastry bag using the "star" tip and swirled it around each cherry until covered giving it a nice appearance. Last year when I made these cookies, there was a lot of icing left over but this year there wasn't as much probably due to applying more frosting with the pastry bag and not adding quite as much cherry juice. I still added the icing BEFORE baking the cookie and the icing maintained it's appearance.

Loved these. Want to save money but still have great cookies? eliminate the melted chocolate/sweetened condensed milk and cut the cherries in half. Think of it with the full cherries and chocolate as great when you want almost a truffle, and if you want a cookie instead you can go lighter.

I didn't bake the cookie with the icing, I piped it on using a baggie after the cookies were done.  I got a lot of requests for the recipe.  These are really good, if you like the chocolate cherry combo, you will love this cookie.  Thanks for sharing.

they were good, but the dough was thick and kind of flavorless. next time I will use an extra egg like someone else suggested. Also, I ended up with way more frosting than I needed.

These were pretty good.  I some issues with the icing--kept having to add extra juice because it kept clumping and couldn't seem to get the right consistency.  The cookie itself though is fantastic.  Tastes like a moist and delicious brownie.  I would never sub in marg or anything for the real butter.  I am thinking about using the cookie dough recipe, omitting the cherry stuff and adding chocolate chips for a super chocolately cookie!

i really really wanted to like these cookies- i came across the recipe on xmas eve and even trekked to to grocery store at the last minute to pick up the cherrie... i added an extra egg and a splash of cherry juice to the batter, but kept everything else as written- my cookies came out dry and they didnt even spread :( the chocolate cherry icing for these somewhat saves them, but not nearly enough for me to ever make again, nonetheless serve to company

These cookies were very good and tasted like brownies.  I followed the recipe exactly except for putting two tablespoons of cherry juice in the batter which help the texture.  As much as I liked the cookies, there was not much cherry flavor.  I think next time I will chop up cherries and put them in the cookie batter.

Delicious! Easy to make, too. Took barely 30 minutes to do everything from mixing the batter to making the frosting to baking. The only change I did was adding less cherry juice to the frosting, after about two teaspoons the frosting seemed quite thin and I didn't want ti to run off the cookies. I also made my cookies a bit large, they ended up about 2" in diameter, because I wanted to bake them all at once and not have to do batches. Came out to 18 cookies total at the size I made them. I will definitely make these again, they were winners.

These taste ok, but the cookie part is incredibly dry.  I could barely roll the dough because it crumbled so much, and when I tried to push my thumb in it cracked at the sides.  I'm not sure what happened, but the ratio of dry to wet ingredients does seem a little off.  In the end, the frosting adds enough moisture to make it ok, but I was very disappointed.  Did anyone else have this problem?

I'd like to start by saying I love these cookies!  I just made them and by using two teaspoons of dough per cookie I got 40 cookies which turned out to be the perfect size.  When making the hole, I made it only wide enough for the cherry to fit but fairly deep.  I filled the whole 2/3 of the way with the chocolate sauce using a squeeze bottle and then placed the cherry over the sauce and baked.  After they cooled I decorated with stripes and it was the perfect look.
Hint:  When using a plastic squeeze bottle with the chocolate, microwave for 12 seconds for ease.
Thank you for a fantastic holiday cookie recipe!

While this recipe is great as is, I've made a "cheater" version with Hershey's Cherry Cordial Kisses. (Freeze the candy first - very important.) Make the dough as is, but roll into balls and place in mini muffin tin.  Bake 7 - 8 min.  Take out of the oven and immediately press a kiss into the cookie.  I've made these with the Cherry Kisses, Carmel Kisses and even Reese's Cups.  While my review offers an alternate version, my rating applies to the original version.

I will say that the picture with this recipe isn't accurate. The icing in the pic is drizzled on and the cherry is visible.  Following the recipe, the entire cherry is covered with the icing.

Great recipe! I used fresh-picked pitted sweet cherries which lent a "Black Forest Cake" flavor to the cookies.
Other changes I  made to the recipe were:
1)used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of 1 cup white), 2) added 2 tbsps of sweetened condensed milk to cookie recipe 3)used milk chocolate chips for the glaze, 3)I placed a couple of chocolate chips on the top of the cookie before baking, 4)pressed the cherries into the cookies (and glazed them) AFTER baking, 5)cooled the cookies completely before glazing, 6)added 1/2 tsp almond flavoring and 2 tbsp fresh-squeezed cherry juice to the glaze. I doubled the cookie recipe but kept the glaze recipe single, which was the perfect amount of glaze.  Double cookie recipe yielded 54 incredibly delicious brownie-like cookies. The family loved 'em!

I personally did not care for these cookies.  I did as others had suggested and added an extra egg for a more chewy cookie other wise I made them as is.  My mother stopped by and loved the cookie.  She is a chocaholic though.  I think that is the secret,  you really need to like chocolate.

Wow! Great recipe. When I was making the thumbprints in the cookies, I found that my thumb was sticking to the dough. I dipped my thumb in a bit of the reserved cherry juice before I pressed it into each cookie to avoid sticking. It worked great and gave a tad more of the cherry flavor to each cookie. Yum!

To give a better flavor to contrast the dark chocolate I use canned dark cherries instead and the results were much better (less sweet and a better flavor). Either way these cookies are the first to go when put out.

I get requests for this recipe everytime I've made it... they always come out great, though I've experimented with a few variations.  I think I've finally decided how I prefer to make them.  

I make the cookies a little on the small size - almost so you can pop the whole cookie in your mouth.  I don't drain the cherries - I pluck them straight from the jar so that a tiny bit of the juice settles in the well of the cookie that you make with your thumb.  I think this helps the cookies stay moist and adds more of the cherry flavor.  I bake the cookies for 8 minutes with a bit of the frosting on top (just enough to cover the cherry so it doesn't get funky in the oven). Then I add more frosting on top after they've come out of the oven (so they look prettier).  They're super moist so be sure you let them cool down on a rack before you attempt to move them or they'll fall apart.

This is a recipe I've enjoyed in my family's holidays for over twenty years!!  I had lost it, and I'm so excited to have found it here!  These cookies are so irresistable, if you love chocolate and maraschino cherries, you can't resist.  YUM!!
(by the way, the "classic" method is to bake the cookies with the fudge sauce & cherry included.)

Very good but do NOT bake the frosting - it bubbled and crystalized and was not near as pretty. Adding the fudge later keeps it glossy and dark looking - sooo much prettier and tastier (make it while cookies cooling)

I doubled the recipe which made 74 cookies.  I wrongly took the advise and DIDN'T double the chocolate topping.  This left some with empty holes as I whipped up some more ganache.  I actually like the looks of the topping better doing this after they baked.  Makes for a prettier presentation!

You WILL need to double this recipe, because these cookies go fast.  I make on parchment paper for easy cleanup - the topping can be a little difficult to clean off your cookie sheets if any spills bake on.  

Trust me - Santa will leave jewelry if you include these on the milk and cookie plate!

truly decadent cookies.  I made these one night for Christmas, and they were such a hit that my husband went out for more cherries because he demanded I make another batch.  I had a hard time with them, they were involved and messy to make but they are so worth it.  I halved the cherries to fit better in the cookies and they were also easier to eat that way.  I had a little trouble with the dough cracking and they weren't the prettiest cookies I've ever made but they are sooo good they will disappear soon after you put them out.

So good.  Makes more than 18. More like 24.  I made half using whole cherries and the rest using half cherries.  Both are good but you can fit more of the yummy frosting on them when you only use half a cherry.  This is a cookie that everyone will love!

These are on my Chistmas cookie baking list every year. They are a bit of a pain to make, but worth it. I use half a cherry on each cookie instead of a whole one, it helps leave room for the chocolate topping without it dripping over the sides (though I am always surprised at how well the topping stays put during baking, you just have to make a REALLY deep dent in the dough for the cherry and the topping). The cookies store fairly well too, which is good for me since I start my holiday baking a few weeks before Christmas.

"Mmmmm", "Ohhhh my", "Ummm" ... This was all I heard, along with some other joyful expressions, as co-workers ate these incredible cookies.  A "temp" even asked if I was married....  She said, "if a guy can cook like this, he would have to make a wonderful husband!!!"

I have to disagree with the majority of the reviews.  Not that the taste isn't what they say but, I rate a recipe with the presentation in mind also.  Like others have said, they are messy and you have to be too careful with the placement of the frosting.  I baked mine with the cherry and then I drizzeled the choc. mixture over them.  They looked so much more appetizing with the drizzle than the frosting just rolling off of the cookie. I don't think I'll make these again.

You can't even believe how good these cookies are.  The best cookies right out of the oven EVER. They get raves every time I make them.  Take the earlier advice to double the cookie recipe but not the "frosting".

Just made 10 dozen of these for my annual cookie swap. Although not that pretty to look at they taste great and I can't wait for the girls to try them. I also found out that all jar cherries are not the same size. (lol) I bought jars from different stores. The first jars were small cherries 1 cherry fit perfectly, the second jars were quite large and i needed to cut them in half.

These are just sinful, they are so good. I usually double the recipe, because *everyone* who tries these cookies always wants at least two!

The only problem: The recipe calls for WAY too much frosting. Solution? When you double the recipe, *dont'* double the frosting. It will come out almost perfectly.

These are rich and delicious. I made them for my husband for Valentine's day and he loved them! I measured out 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough for each cookie and covered each with 1 1/2 - 2 tsp. of the chocolate sauce and swirled it around to completely cover the cherry. An impressive fancy cookie. I got about 27 cookies.

I couldn't find my recipe, so I knew that I could find it here. After reading a majority of the reviews, I felt that it needed some clarification (hence the 4 stars rather than 5). The original published recipe called for the chocolate topping to be added after the cookies are baked. Also, the pictures are deceiving. The chocolate shouldn't be drizzled over the top, it should be spooned over the cherries similar to chocolate covered cherries. This results in the correct ratio of chocolate (not an excess amount that other readers had) and the cookies will remain softer. Also, I make the dough balls just big enough to fit a cherry on top.

Absolutely delicious.  I added an extra egg as some have advised for the chewy factor.  As such, the dough was a bit loose for rolling, but chilling it for a few minutes in the fridge before baking solved that.  I will definitely be adding these to my tried and true Christmas cookie list.  Double the batch, trust me... you'll be glad you did!

I really wanted to like this. The pictures looked great. I thought to make only 1/2 of the fudge on top, and I wish I did because only half would fit on all of the cookies. I tried to do the drizzle technique, but it took a little too much effort to keep it thin enough to drizzle. I scooped the chocolate fudge on top in a tsp. increment, as suggested, and it had a very strange appearance with the 2 chocolate color variations and the bump in the middle from the cherry. Maybe, I am weird, but these resembled a body part to me. They were going to to go to a work office and I decided not a good idea. I didn't want any possible office discussion. Even if it is a little extra effort go for the chocolate drizzle to help with these appearance wise. The cookie does not need all that fudge anyway, they are already waaaayyy too SWEET! They were like eating uncooked brownie batter, in the center, finished off by sugary gritty grains in the mouth. I did cook them the full 10 minutes to and they appeared to be done on the outside. I guess I am really in the minority on this one.

fantastic! almost like a chocolate covered cherry piece of candy. We are in a motor home and stay in a park in Texas. I baked these for  bingo and my neighbor told me not to take them. They're too good. She actually wanted to buy them from me. Needless to say, I gave her some. I didn't take them to Bingo. She said they are her favorite cookie.

I have the same recipe for these cookies only they are called Buried Cherry Cookies.  Last time I made them was at Christmas time.  Unfortunately none of them made it to my cookie dish.  I couldn't bear to part with them.  I gave about 6 to my doctor and then I ate all the rest of them myself.  :-)

To be honest, these look better then they taste.  They don't taste bad, just bland.  I did add extra cherry juice to the frosting as well as to the cookie itself but it is still pretty bland.  I'd make these again but might experiment with a different flavour extract.....

I made these just as the recipe says except that I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  These are my new favorite cookies!!!!  I put the chocolate icing on before as well as after baking and they are so gooey and very chocolaty.

I added an egg for additional moistness and I think the cookies would have been too dry without it, because they still weren't as moist and chewy as I was hoping. Next time, I might use oil instead of butter. The cookies themselves were not very sweet at all, so I would not recommend omitting the frosting. I piped my frosting AFTER baking and added more cherry juice, which still wasn't quite as cherry-y as I would prefer. Since these were going to have to travel in a container with other baked goods, I added a few tablespoons of powdered sugar to my frosting mix to make it thicker. Just make sure the frosting is mixed totally smooth and lump-free prior to piping. Will make again, but I'll be making more tweaks.

Very, very good.  The children said these were awesome and they were soft the day after.  No changes needed, other than adding an additional egg.  Also, note, I am a novice baker and did not know that I should have had the butter at room temperature or microwaved a little prior to blending butter with sugar!  Also, I only yielded 15 cookies (hence they were big).  I will cut initial size down next time to make 30!

I was really glad to find this recipe. My boyfriend makes these cookies and lost the recipe. This seems to be the same one.  We make the cookies really small. Before they go in the oven they are about the size of a store bought choc covered cherry. They get pretty big after baking. We then push the cherry in and completely cover it with a chocolate blob. Try these as written first. No recipe changes needed in my opinion.

Make these!  Make a double batch--that way you can use a whole bag of chocolate chips, and almost a whole can of sweetened condensed milk.  I promise that you can never, ever, have too many of these cookies!!  I've been making these for about 20 years now.  Got the recipe from my mother in-law.  These are my favorite cookies!  I only make them at Christmas time.  Otherwise I'd weigh about 500 lbs.  These cookies keep very well, and freeze even better.  In fact, I prefer them  after they've been out of the freezer for about 5 minutes.  :)

A delicious, soft and chewy, fudgey cookies. A definite keeper recipe!  I doubled the recipes to make about 32 cookies. The dough was very stiff so I added a little cherry juice from the maraschino cherries, and then I put the bowl with the dough in the freezer a few minutes to make it easier to roll into the walnut size balls. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Tastes like a fudgy brownie topped with a cherry.  I cut the cherries in half and placed that on top.  Next time I might mince some and but it into the batter.

I made these cookies with half each of white and brown sugar..they were delicious and they do freeze really well--they still have a chewy consistency    I frosted with the topping AFTER baking..they tasted great, but topping was messy.   These cookies would be great without topping.

Im giving 5 star for taste because these cookies are very good. But i had some prob with the frosting. I think its better to frost after baking, because my frosting melted & created a mess on the cookie sheet. So its better to frost post-bake. Also, will reduce the baking time to abt 8 minutes. but all in all they taste great!

These cookies are sooo good! I brought them into work and everything loved them!! I made a couple of changes. I put 1 tsp of cherry juice into the dough and doubles the amount of cherry juice in the drizzle. I also halved the drizzle, except the cherry juice, because it yeilded too much. A couple suggestions: 1. do not make an indent, just press the cherry in the center 2. add the drizzle after the cookies come out. I think they taste better the second day! I have already passed this recipe off to two others! :)

I am so in love with these cookies!!  I made this for Christmas about 6 times. Everyone that has them wants the recipes. I can't wait until I can make them the next time and eat a couple!!! Like all cooks I made a couple changes. I use cherry extract instead of vanilla, so you will have more of the cherry taste. It really does make a difference. In the icing I use the whole cn of condesed milk, add more cherry extract and extra cherry juice from the can. I mean about 1/4 cup or more. The more you use the more cherry and chocolate taste you will get. I also put the chocolate over the cookies to bake (on that baking paper, they will make a mess), then when they are done about 15 to 20 minutes later. (they take longer to cook then stated) I let them set on pans for 3 to 5 minutes then pour more chocolate over the cookies. Let set out for couple hours or more and let cool and set. Save the extra chocolate and you can always use more if you would like. Then enjoy!! These really are now my favorite cookies now!!!!

These are great!  I've been making a similar recipe from the BH&G cookbook for years.  My only complaint is that there is too much frosting.  I did like another reviewer suggested and added another tsp. frosting after they came out of the oven.  I still have some left over, but I think it will make a nice ice cream topping!  I used an 1/8 cup measure to divide the dough up and I came out with exactly 18 cookies.  They are delicious with a wonderful cherry flavor!

These cookies are absolutely scrumptious! Very rich and chocolately which is exactly what I was looking for. Didn't change a thing. Made these for Christmas and expect they will make it to my baking list next year! Thanks Jaime. Great recipe!

Oooops!!  First let me just say that these cookies are delicious, and the chocolate sauce is to die for!!  Now, I actually made a big booboo, while my 16 month old daughter is tugging at my pants trying to stand up crying, my 10 yr old daughter is helping me make the cookies and is asking me which ingredient to mix in next, I told her "the condensed milk" and after she poured it in the bowl, I said Oooops we just messed this recipe up, the condensed milk was for the sauce not for the cookie dough; since I'm just starting to play with cookie making from scratch, I thought I would have to throw away the dough, but instead decided to give it a try and put them in the oven anyway....   I was pleasantly surprised to see them raising and looking like a cookie after 4 minutes of baking.... (I didn't think that was going to happen)  The end result was a scrumptious very chewy chocolate covered cherrie cookie.  I loved them, and so did my 10 yr old!  But next time I want to follow the recipe the way it should be, I'm sure they will be awesome cookies.   My advice though, would be to put more cherry juice to really taste the cherry flavor if you love cherries as much as I do, I actually put in about 5 fluid oz of cherry juice.  DELICIOUS!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!!! =)

I made only half the icing but added 6 tsp of cherry juice to it and 2 tbsp of cherry juice to the batter.  The cookies came out with a definite cherry-chocolate flavor.  These are very pretty and delicious too!

These were the Christmas cookies that my family members were sneaking when I wasn't looking.  As an FYI, the recipe makes far more cookies than the recipe notes.  The glaze is excellent and should be drizzled on before being baked.  Do not add on any additional baking time or they will dry out.  The moisture of the cherries makes them perfectly soft by the next day.  They came out perfectly.  Beware: We had so much of the glaze left over that I was eating it with a spoon. (Yes it was that good!)

I believe this is now my family's favorite Christmas Cookie! I like to try a new cookie each Christmas and this was my choice this year. This is a keeper. Great texture and superb flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I loved these and pushed them on everybody! And everyone liked them! My boyfriend tried a variation on them with pineapple instead of cherries, and that was good too!  I only used about half as much of the coco powder, so they wouldn't be as rich.

These were really good.  I found the batter kind of dry so I added some of the cherry juice.  The chocolate sauce does make a lot.  I added too much juice to it so it was kind of runny, but otherwise they turned out really well.  Kind of tasted like brownie chocolate covered cherries.  Thanks!

What's not to like?  These were so good.  Per other suggestions, I added 1 egg plus 1 yolk; made a chewier cookie.  Also baked on parchment and made a large indentation for lots of frosting.  Husband inhaled these as did his coworkers. Made 25 cookies.

There is something wrong with this recipe. But because most of the reviews are favourable, I decided to make these cookies; however, the end result looks almost nothing like the pictures, and has more in common with the less favourable reviews for this recipe. I used the correct amounts and followed the directions exactly for the cookies (except that I added an egg, as per some reviewers). Also, all of my ingredients were pretty fresh, i.e., not old or sitting too long on the shelf. But the cookies came out a little dry, even though I only baked for 8 min, they cracked and hardly spread, and the texture/flavour was very brownie-like. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'd have made brownies if I wanted brownies.) As for flavour, the cookies were just okay--if they were delicious I could overlook the other things that didn't work out. In the end, I drizzled white chocolate over the cookies, hoping to disguise the fact that they were so cracked and weird-looking.

I really wanted to like this cookie.  Although time-consuming, they were easy enough to make, and the presentation was terrific.  Mine came out looking just like the ones in the main photo.  I just didn't like the cookie.  I might try the concept again with maybe a sugar cookie.  I'll keep working with this recipe.

A good cookie that was different.  I wouldn't classify it as my favorite cookie "and I do love chocolate and cherries" but it was definitely tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly.  These are also good just by themselves without the cherries & added chocolate.  They form a soft cake like cookie.

I made two batches of these this holiday season and they went over really well.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I made half the frosting at a time since it took a while to put it on the cookies, that way it was fresh and spreadable.

I personal favorite for my 84 year old grandmother.  I can't keep her out of them.  However, I've made these adding an extra egg as one person advised and once without.  The additional egg made the dough VERY hard to work with and I ended up adding an additional cup of flour and still had problems.  I would stick with the original recipe.

My cookies looked like the cookies in the photo "Marla" took, the chocolate topping went a bit messy, they didn't look very nice at all but the taste was great.  My son loved them, kept going back for more.  Flavor-wise, they were very yummy and chocolaty, with a fudgy center, which made me think of brownies.  So for taste they get 5 stars, but for presentation it would have to be 2.... but I guess we're rating for taste in this instance!

These turned out great!  I did add extra cherry juice to the frosting, and they were the perfect consistency.  These were delicious warm, but even better after being refrigerated.  I'll definately make these again, thanks.

Very easy to make. I used 3/4 c powdered sugar instead of 1 c regular white sugar, and they turned out fine. I've never seen cookies that say "frost before baking" .... but these are fabulous!

Decided to make these for our cookie exchange at work.  Recipe was VERY easy, and with a little over 1" balls, made 30 cookies.  I made only a few changes: added a few tbs of cherry juice to the batter, put the cherry in before I baked, then put the chocolate in a zip-loc baggie and piped over the cookie while warm.  Next time, will make smaller balls (about 1/2") so they are more bite size with a cherry in every bite.

These are soooo good! And easy to make. I use a 1/4 round teaspon to indent the cookie for the cherry, perfect size and helps cuts the prep time.

I make these cookies every year at Christmas but I make them slightly different than the recipe. I bake the cookie first, then add the cherry to the top as soon as they come out of the oven while the cookie is still hot.  Wait until the cookie has cooled to add the frosting.  They look and taste wonderful!

These were good, but not as moan inspiring as I thought they would be.  This recipe makes more than 18 cookies. I had closer to 3 dozen.  I'm going to try them again with the following changes: I'll made them smaller so they're more of a "one bite" cookie (maybe using 1/2 a cherry).  This way I'll get chocolate and cherry in EVERY bite.  To make them more attractive, I may try drizzling the frosting over the cooled cookie, rather than baking it on top.

This was great! I was a little afraid to try it at first because there weren't that many ratings or reviews (although they all seemed to be positive) but I thought I wanted to try to make a different kind of cookie, besides the usual boring chocolate chip or sugar cookies.  This was absolutely wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and everything turned out great, not too sweet and has just the right flavor. The cherry in the middle really makes them unique and fun. I'm going to make these again and again. They'll show up at family gatherings in the future for sure!

My 14 year old son made these for the holidays and they were the best!  They are not difficult yet the finished product looks as if you worked all day!  They are beautiful and totally yummy!  The only thing we did differently is use 1/2 a cherry in each cookie because we bought the wrong size jar.  Wait...you'll have a hard time keeping these around for sure!  Also, they are easy to store.  We put them in tins for gifts.

These are too good to be *just* for special occassions.  A little work, so I usually double or triple the recipe to get it out of the way, but these are our favorite cookies in this house...

I have made these several times and they always turn out wonderfully. As I always use parchment paper I have no problems with sticking. If you find your cookies are spreading too much try chilling your dough after forming the balls and adding the cherries. For aesthetic reasons I drizzle my chocolate on after the cookies are out of the oven (but still warm). I triple the recipe and not the chocolate ganache (there is plenty). Freeze your cookies on a pan then pack them into tins with parchment paper between layers to keep your drizzle looking beautiful until serving time (or Christmas in my case). I do not suggest adding an egg as these cookies are to have a sandy, crumbly texture similar to shortbread. By adding an egg you will have to much 'wet' ingredients and end up with a cakey cookie. Hope that helps!

I used the chocolate topping with the maraschino cheery on a crackle cookie recipe and threw on top a few pink and red heart sprinkles for valentines.  Tasted like a chocolate covered cherry and looked as good as it tasted.

This is a favorite holiday cookie, we make about 4 batches. Hint is: One batch of frosting will make enough to cover a double batch of cookies (maybe more!), use a baby food spoon to place the frosting on the cherry. We make the cookies small and cut the cherry in half placing cut side down on the cookie. If cookie dough is too dry, add some of the cherry juice. Also add more juice to the frosting as it tends to thicken as it sits.

I followed this recipe and wasn't a fan of how they turned out.  These are more cake or brownies then cookie.  They don't taste bad, but they are overpoweringly sweet.  You don't get a great tasting desert. 

I won't be making this again, just not worth the time.

I made this once now.  My family loved them. I think I will drizzle chocolate next time. I tried using a teaspoon and covered the cherry but it was just over the cherry. I think they would look more like the photo if  I drizzled them or could put the chocolate in some kind of squeeze bottle. They are delicious!

Very good!  These are quite rich and on the sweet side, but not a bad thing- actually keeps me from eating too many.  I did add an extra egg per reviews.  Yum.  Would be really nice on a cookie tray!

I've been making this recipe for years ... My mom gave it to me and likely got it from the magazine. The cookies are always a hit. While the frosting makes a lot, it saves well in the fridge and is wonderful mixed into milk for hot cocoa or stirred into coffee for a decadent mocha.

This was a good recipe, although I made a few adjustments based on personal taste and reviews. I added the second egg, making for a more chewy cookie, and used dark cocoa powder for the mix. They came out perfect, almost better than when my Amma made them for me as a little girl! I was very happy to have the help of so many good reviews to read before hand to make sure they came out great!

I found this recipe 2 years ago now and really loved it. Only giving 4 stars because i needed to adjust a bit to get the consistency right. My major challenge though was getting enough cherry flavor and getting a drizzle consistency that would harden enough to make for easier storage and presentation. 

I took the advice of other reviewers and added the extra egg (this did make them much more chewy!,) but still couldn't get enough cherry flavor at a good consistency. 

This third time I made them, I decided to reduce all of the maraschino cherry juice over low heat to thicken it first. Once it was like syrup I let it cool and thicken a bit, then I added half to the cookie dough and half to the chocolate drizzle mix. This really did the trick! The cookies and drizzle had way more cherry flavor and the drizzle hardened much better then ever before. 

I will keep doing this in the future. Also, a good note, after trying it both ways, I decided on drizzling before baking it is less shiny, but also isn't so sticky, so its possible to stack them better for storage. Thanks for the great recipe. This is the unanimous favorite cookie every year! :)

I did not care for this particular cookie at all (sorry!). Since my changes MAY be to blame, I'm willing to give this another try.... I pretty much followed Jamie's directions to the letter with the exception of one (minor) change. I added approximately 2 T cherry juice to my cookie dough and subbed almond extract in lieu of the vanilla flavoring called for. I think the addition of cherry liquid (and the fact that I shaped my dough into balls slightly larger than a walnut) may have caused my cookies to spread. :( I was hoping for petite-sized cookies, but what I ended up with was LARGE, flat ones. Next time, I'll be sure to use my 1 T cookie scoop and I won't add any liquid to my dough! The chocolate filling is quite tasty, albeit with the addition of almost TRIPLE the amount of cherry juice called for (as is, I could barely detect a cherry flavor). I found it very difficult to drizzle my cookies with the leftover sauce (it was thick and gloppy, like soft ganache), even after thinning it considerably with ADDITIONAL cherry juice! All in all, this is a decent cookie, but is not presentable enough (at least to my standards) to include with my Christmas cookie trays. For all the effort involved, I expected more. Maybe this will be your new favorite, but it wasn't mine. Thanks anyways, Ms. Carpenter! :-)

They are just ok. I added an extra egg to the cookie part as per a few other suggestions. The actual cookie was kind of bland.  The chocolate topping definitely saved it.  I added the chocolate before baking as well as after after I took them out of the oven. I'm so glad I added the second round of chocolate or I think I would have just ended up throwing the cookies out.  I won't be making these again.

Pretty easy recipe and the cookies were so good. I've made this twice now and the only thing I've changed a little is the frosting. Took the advice of another poster and added a little more cherry juice.

Was a nice soft cookie, spread a little too much had to add extra flour.  Was not too fussed on the glaze just melted chocolate over the cherry would have been better and easier.

I love these.  I baked them with and without the frosting.  I felt putting the frosting on the cookies after were best.

These cookies were very well liked, so I made them three times.  The kids, on this block, liked them, so did my children, grandchildren, my husband and myself.  Thanks for this recipe.

My dough was crumbly and dry. I read and re-read the instructions and ingredients. I don't see where I went wrong. Also, I ended up with more dough than cherries. I had great expectations for these cookies and bummed they didn't turn out that great.

These were super easy to make, and make a great presentation! I added an extra egg as one reviewer suggested (perfect!), I also used candied cherries which seemed to work out nicely. I was also thinking about not using the cherry juice (because I used candied cherries), but went ahead and cracked open a jar or maraschino cherries anyhow, and was very glad I did. I really think the subtle cherry flavor in the chocolate makes a huge difference.

These are one of my favorites.  Best if the cherries are well drained before putting on the cookies then completely covered with the chocolate before baking. Keeps the cherries a little moist and really brings out  the cherry flavor.  Then, you don't have very much extra chocolate frosting left.  They really expand when cooking, about double the size.  So, keep them small and space them out well.  Recipe really makes about 24 cookies.

Excellent! Everyone loved these(grown-ups and kids). They were moist and almost brownie-like and the frosting tasted like gooey cherry fudge. I made them exactly according to the recipe, I only doubled for cookie and frosting.  Some leftover frosting- but not alot, and kids will find a use for it ;) mmmmmm

One of my new favorites.  My daughters and I like maraschino cherries straight from the jar, so I knew that these would be a big hit.  Following previous reviewers, I opted to drizzle the chocolate glaze on after baking.  I think that these would have been a mess trying to bake them with the glaze.  They are soft, chewy, and the cherry is definitely "the cherry on top".  These are going to be a cookie added to my holiday cookie plate.  Thanks!

Love these!  I made these twice in just as many days.  I used maraschino cherries and also multi-coloured glace cherries.  The maraschino's were the best.  I also covered the cherry with chocolate as well as just putting chocolate stripes on some.  I think leaving the cherry uncovered makes the most attractive cookie.  I also did some with a combo of white choco and dark choco accents.  These are def one of my new fav cookies!  One little note, initially I thought the 9 servings meant I would only get about 9 or so cookies but I anaged to get 3-4 dozen out of the recipe.  So not sure exactly what's considered a serving size with this cookie.

I just made these for a Christmas Cookie Swap Party.  They are great!  I was skeptical because it seemed odd to spread icing on a cookie and then bake it, but it actually worked!  The icing stays soft and covers the cherry, without running all over the place while it bakes.  The cookie is nice and soft as well and has great flavor.  I will definitely make these again; they would be great for Valentine's Day also!

These are my signature cookies.  I make them every year at Christmas and it never fails that someone asks for the recipe when I take them somewhere to share.  I vary slightly from this recipe in that I bake the cookie first, add the cherry when they come out of the oven while still warm.  Then add the icing after the cookie has cooled somewhat.  These are excellent cookies!

Great cookies.  Delicious, and very pretty.  I followed the recipe, but made mine larger, about golf ball size, and then put 2 or 3 cherries in the middle.  I had to triple the cookie recipe, but not the icing...it came out just right.  Everyone loved them.

I was looking for a new cookie recipe for a Fall Bake sale, and thought these sounded good, so I made the recipe just about verbatim, only added a few tablespoons of cherry juice to the dough, got a nice soft dough that was surprisingly not too sticky. I used a teaspoon to make the well, used a bit of frosting to keep the cherry in place, and put the remaining icing in a ziplock bag and drizzled the cookies before baking, and according to my super critical Hubby, they are simply awesome and must be included on the Holiday Cookie List! I did only get barely 2 dozen from the original recipe, will have to double or triple that in the future, and I did as other reviewers mentioned and halved the icing recipe and still had a bit leftover. Overall, I really like this recipe, the cookie portion alone I'm going to use and play with, add chocolate chunks and such, so thanks to Jamie for a great recipe!

Everyone loves these cookies! I am terrible at cooking and baking, butmy boyfriend tells everyone how delicious these cookies are. I advise to either double the cookie ingredients or make only half of the frosting.  Following the recipe leaves a lot of excess frosting in the pot; but using all the frosting on the given amount of cookies makes them way too sweet.

These cookies were delicious!!  My family loved them.  They were very easy to make.  I didn't have the problem with the dough being too dry, like some others did!  I thought the dough was wonderfully easy to work with.  I was very surprised that the chocolate sauce didn't ooze off of the cookies as they baked!!  Will definately be making again.  Thanks!

These cookies are scrumptious! Soft and chewy, and the chocolate topping is great. I liked the photo of the cookies with the topping drizzled on, but I was unable to get that effect. Too runny? Next time I might use less condensed milk, but I will definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious and easy!  I added some of the cherry juice to the cookie batter and chocolate topping.  I also used an extra egg so they were softer.  I gave them to my family and my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he asked if the topping was made of "chocolate and sex" :P

LOVED IT!!!  It tasted exactly chocolate covered cherries.  I found the icing to definitely have a cherry taste but I would definitely only make half as much since I had a lot of it left over.

Very good concept, but the measurements on this don't quite work. The dough is way to dry. I add an extra egg or butter (whatever I have on hand) and I ALWAYS put cherry juice in the actual cookie batter. That really makes the cookies delicious. Also, I only make about half of the chocolate sauce. That is enough to cover the cookies in my opinion. If all that is done, the cookies are amazing.

These are good, but don't seem to be the best tasting.  I like the idea of cookies tasting like chocolate-covered cherries, but the cookie just doesn't have the best chocolate flavor.  Rather bland in my taste.  Don't think I'll make this recipe again.

These were delicious and pretty easy to make.  I did add a little melted butter to the dough mix to make it a little easier to work with.  It seemed to be very crumbley without it.  Other than that, it was perfect!

I have made these for years. It is my daughter in laws favorite cookie. She MUST have them on every holiday and birthday. She is a good baker also, but says they taste better when I make them. LOL. One of the best and I have hundreds of recipes.

These are so fantastic.  Cutting the icing recipe in half is a must.  I put the icing on under the cherry to make them more attractive.  Then I put the left over icing in a ziplock bag and cut off the tip and drizzled stripes on the top which makes for a much prettier cookie.  They taste like chocolate covered cherries.  Yummy.

I had to change this slightly because I'm lazy & didn't feel like going out, but they still turned out great. I used 3 package of instant hot chocolate, & decreased the sugar by 6 tablespoons. Very tasty!

With all the high reviews, I thought these would be better. I liked them...the cookie was a little dry for me. But they were good. I think next time I will use white chocolate chips for a more dramatic look.

I have a history of not being able to bake cookies right. These cookies were very easy to bake! My husband loves them, he said they would be better without the cherry... but I think the cherry is an excellent addition. They taste a lot like the Fudge Rounds... next time I make these I will do half with cherry and half without. I also put the icing on after they were baked.

THE     ! Absolutley wonderful. I needed some cookies to put in my husbands cookies and wanted something different then the traditional Oatmeal Raisin or Chocolate Chip. He loves cherries and chocolate so this was a winner. Be sure to be generous with the milk, choc chip and cherry jusice mixture though when you're frosting. I ended up with a good amount left towards the end so I started putting more on the last tray that went in then before and it worked fine. Makes them yummier too. EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!

These were excellent! I took a few suggestions from others, and used two eggs, which was perfect. I also made the balls smaller, which were cute. I wanted to use 1/2 c. brown and 1/2 cup white sugar,  but ended up only being able to use white. I upped the amount of vanilla a little, and used 2 tsp. of cherry juice in the batter. The only problem I had was that I took someone else's suggestion and bought the Cherryman cherries (extra large), but ran out of cherries about 1/2 way through. Therefore, I would highly suggest using them, but make sure you buy two jars. Also, I waited until I took the cookies out of the oven and then piped the chocolate onto them with a Ziplock bag. Will DEFINITELLY make these again.

I thought the cookies were easy enough to make, dough seemed a bit dry, & cookies are a little too hard for my liking. However, they taste good, and will make them again. Next time will use suggestions by others to try 1/2 cup of brown sugar, an extra egg, & some cherry juice. The cookies are pretty, I drizzled the glaze over the cherry allowing the red to show through. The icing is delicious but recipe makes too much of it as others have also said. May make another batch to use remaining icing.

Yum - little bon bons.  The cookie recipe is chewy, rich, and intensely chocolatey - mmmmm.  I tried a couple of different ways of assembly, as suggested by other reviewers, and I thought putting the cookies together before baking made the best tasting cookie, although they were all good.  Next time I think I'll shoot for equal size of cookie base and cherry; the dough spread more than I expected, and I like the idea of tiny little cookie-candies...  Thanks so much for sharing!

These cookies were to die for...sinfully delicious!!!  I made them with some help from my nieces for my Mom on Mother's day...she loves chocolate covered cherries, so I knew she'd enjoy these!  I bought a large candy box and placed each cookie in a silver foil candy wrapper and tied the box with a big silver bow...it was a beautiful presentation.  I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't need ANY alterations, although it did make way too much icing...but I used it to top some ice cream sundaes for the girls!

These cookies are the best I have ever had. I have had to make them for my boss three times already. He even gave me the money to buy the stuff. If you like chocolate covered cherrys you will love these.They are easy to make too. My 13 year old daughter made them once and they turned out perfect.

Made these for a "cookie exchange". They are quite good, but gave a 4 star rating for how messy they were to roll into balls. Very tasty though.

Well, they SOUND great... I was a little disappointed with the texture of the cookie, a bit grainy for me. I only frosted half before cooking, and they come out better, in my opinion, to frost them after they come out of the oven and cool a bit. Not bad, but probably won't make again unless asked to.

I have made this recipe 2 times in the past week. The first time, the dough for the cookie was extremely dry and grainy. The second time, I added 2 teaspoons of cherry juice to the dough and cmpletely covered the cookies with the frosting. The cookies turned out perfect! These are defunately my new signature dessert.

Hi.  Took a lot of effort to make the cookie and it looked quite ugly when it was done. I think it would have been better to bake the cookie then add the chocolate and cherry when it was done cooling. The cookie dough its self did not taste very good to me.

I am NEVER making these cookies again!  I just made them 3 hours ago, and I've already eaten four...or is it five...  I'm going to gain 20 pounds from these cookies!  Anyway, these have the best taste ever, and I don't really like cookies all that much!  One thing that did bother me when making the cookies was trying to mix the dry ingredients into the butter, sugar and egg.  I found this a bit difficult and ending up using my hands to get it all to come together, but, hey, it worked!

Very good cookies!  I halved the cherries like several reviewers suggested, but I don't think I'd do that again.  I do think they could use a stronger cherry flavor, so I'll leave the cherries whole next time.

these tasted good, though the frosting all ran off the cookie...i think the 4 tsp of cherry juice made it too runny and we didn't push the cherry far enough into the ball.  next time we will definitly do that so the frosting doesn't go all down the sides and onto the sheet. there was about half the frosting left over and so we froze it until the next time we make these.
the cherries were very yummy in this and i will probably add more next time.  the whole thing definitly tasted like a brownie and not a cookie.

These are awesome cookies, I started the  sauce while I made the cookies since it takes afew minutes to melt, the second time i made these I  added more cherry juice so it wasnt as thick and they were just as yummy.  Also they are pretty simple to make but the final result make it seem like you slaved all day :)

Awesome! I also put the frosting in a ziploc bag and cut a hole to put it on the cookies. There's definitely too much frosting. These cookies are worth the extra work!

AMAZING!  I made my first batch of them last night and my hubby LOVED them he ate 3 as soon as I would allow him near them LOL!  I must confess I misread the ingredients and added 1/2 LBS instead of 1/2 C of butter so they turned out almost like brownie bites.  Next time I promise to read the directions more carefully .  Although, I'm going to try using milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet and see how they turn out.  I'm planning on sending a batch to my father in NY whole absoultly LOVES chocolate covered cherries and has an incurable sweet tooth :)  Thanks for this wonderful recipe Jamie!!

These cookies stay moist and chewy for days and days.  The frosting bakes perfectly and looks pretty too.  Just be sure to cover the entire cherry with the frosting.

These cookies have been a holiday standard in my family for more than 15 years.  My mom originally found the recipe in a magazine and after making it once, we all fell in love with these rich, chocolatey cookies.  I always make at least a double batch every Christmas and they go fast!

These were SO good! The only thing I would suggest to you is to spread them pretty far apart because they flatten out quite a bit. I also added 6 instead of 4 tsp. of cherry juice to the chocolate spread because you can’t really taste the cherry in it. But overall this is literally the best cookie I have ever tasted!

We rated this recipe a 4 star because it was really sweet. It was still good. We also used evaporated milk instead of condensed milk.

I had to add A LOT more cherry juice to the frosting, and quite a bit to the cookie batter for my own preference, and it ended up tasting just like a Queen Anne's cordial! I only have 2 things that might make me not want to make them again unless I can figure out because they made the process of baking very frustrating; the frosting never fully set so it made a huge mess as well as causing issues regarding packaging them to give to others, and the batter itself was super sticky! Any suggestions from people that had these issues and were able to fix it somehow?

I made these and followed the recipe pretty close.  Just chopped up the cherries and mixed them directly in the batter. I also drizzled the chocolate glaze right after baking.  They were really good.  They Taste like little cherry brownies.

I have been making this recipe for Christmas for the past 21 years!!  It's my son's only must have cookie.  I always double the recipe that way I use a whole can of the condensed milk and an entire bag of chips. To speed up the process I use the small pampered chef cookie scoop, I don't bother rolling the cookies in a ball,  just push the cherry into the cookie dough so there no reason to make a thumb hole.  I also bake them on parchment paper and never have an issue with them sticking.  You can take any leftover frosting and put it in a small container, throw some nuts on top, put it in the fridge and it is fudge!

I read Susan Logsdon's one-star review and was a little skeptical, I thought that amidst the other very positive reviews hers was just an outlier and an unfortunate experience with an otherwise great recipe. However, after making the cookies, I have to say I agree with most of her review-- they do taste like a pretty normal and nothing-new chocolate cookie with a cherry in the middle. And they are kind of brittle, they don't come off the parchment paper very easily without breaking. 

I still give it 2 stars because I didn't think the recipe was poorly written and the frosting wasn't bad, although I did end up with a lot of left over frosting. Here's what I would change to make the recipe better: 

-Half the frosting measurements
-Add an extra egg to make it less brittle
-Put the frosting in the cookie first, then put the cherry on top. The recipe says to do the other way around but it doesn't look good that way, and it also spills over big time and sticks to the parchment paper and makes a ripped-off edge on the cookie because it sticks to the gooey frosting which is stuck to the parchment paper. 
-Use less frosting in general.
-Add .5-1 tsp of almond extract to the frosting, the cherry juice doesn't flavor it at all. 
-Don't add baking powder to the cookie, it turns into a cookie that's trying to be a cake.

Still an okay cookie, but not my favorite.

These are great!  I’ve been making them for over 20 years....from the recipe in the Better Homes & Gardens cookbook.  This is exactly the same recipe. Not once single difference. Here are my adjustments: Don’t use chocolate chips. Use baker’s chocolate. Semisweet, 6 oz. also....amaretto is awesome in the chocolate sauce. I cook it on the stovetop and drizzle it on after the cookies have baked. I’m glad the recipe is easily accessible on allrecipes, but the person who put it up here is not the author credited by BH&G.

My cookies spread out not like the picture.  Wonder what I did wrong?  I did put the dough into the refrigerator to use later.  Also added an extra egg like one other reviewer did.  Not sure what happened.  Tasted good.

We've made these for years using this recipe. They turn out GREAT every time! All of our extended family begs us to make these every year for our Christmas gathering. I add extra cherry  juice to the icing and pour it generously on the cookies before baking (and a little after). Yum!

Not an expert baker. Easy to make- doubled recipe  because of cookie exchange. I did add one extra egg to the double batch so they wouldn’t be so dry.  Don’t love the chocolate sauce, I couldn’t get it to drizzle even with the extra cherry sauce.  Also makes it sweeter than I would like. Thinking of playing around next time by cooking with chocolate chips directly and mixing cherry juice into cookie batter.

Not bad at all.  Easy to make and they taste delicious.  I was going to send these to my daughter who lives out of state but they won't do well thru the mail.  So OK I'll eat them, not all, and take them into work.  I didn't drizzle the chocolate on top o the cookie before baking I pretty much  covered the cherry.  Then when I took them out I put more of the sauce on top.  Can't complain, they are tasty.  Next time I'll put more cherry juice in the batter but other than that, they are good.

I thought these were ok. I personally feel that the recipe needs major tweaking... I doubled it because I’m making cookies for my brother in laws wedding (for the traditional Pittsburgh cookie table!). However, I ran out of cherries WAY before I ran out of cookie dough. I probably had enough dough to get at least another 3 dozen cookies. I only made a single batch of the frosting, and ran out of that at the same time I ran out of cherries. All in all, I got about 6 1/2 dozen cookies (not counting the extra dough).  

I followed what some others recommended, and added some cherry juice to the dough, which made it way too soft to do a traditional thumbprint. I added a smidgen if extra flour, and then refrigerated for about an hour, but I don’t think the refrigeration made much of a difference. 

I ended up using a cookie scoop and pushing a cherry down into each mound, and topping it with the frosting. They came out kind of cakey, although they will add some visual interest to the cookie table. 

I will probably try these again, but as I said already, I would tweak the recipe.

I found this cookie very tasty.  It was different for other cookies which I liked.   I didn't change anything just made it like the recipe says :)

I found this recipe on another website, but see that the ingredients / instructions are pretty much the same.   Another similar recipe had you forming the dough around the cherry, so it was enclosed.  I used frozen sweet cherries instead of maraschino cherries.  I think the maraschino cherries would be easier to work with, because they are firm.   The only change I made was to use 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  I thought the chocolate frosting would be thinner.  Next time I will add more liquid to get it to a consistency that is easier to work with.  The cookies are cooling now, but I did have to "taste test" one of them.  Pretty good.  I will keep this recipe.

Made these last night with minor suggested tweeks to recipe.  I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar. One teaspoon vanilla extract and half a teaspoon almond extract. Added about 4 tablespoons cherry juice to dough while mixing. These cookies turned out amazing. The only thing I'd do differently next time is chop some cherries and also add to dough.  I make a double batch and ended up with 52 nice sized cookies. I did use the icing before the bake as recipe says. Worked fine. I used parchment paper to bake. Helped with cleanup.  If you're making double batch and using whole cherries, you will need 2 large jars.

Very rich, quite similar to a brownie in many ways and very good. Plenty of leftover chocolate sauce, you could prolly half the sauce recipe. Would've liked more cherry taste in there - prolly easy enough to do

I had a cherry chocolate cookie at a cookie exchange awhile back and I was hoping this recipe was it.  Sadly, it was not.  I read the other reviews about the dryness of the cookies and I thought maybe there was something wrong however I made the recipe exactly as printed and sadly, they were quite dry.  Tasty but dry. Not my thing but my husband and daughter  liked them.  The frosting was good though. I may just try a good chocolate cookie recipe on site and just add the cherry juice to the dough and put the cherry on each cookie.  But be warned. These ARE a dryer type cookie.  No doubt about it.

I had these at a friend's house and they were wonderful. So she gave me the recipe. The first couple pans turned out dry and the fudge filling became taffy-like, oozing all over the pan and sticking to it. I let a subsequent pan cool before removal but they still fell apart. 4th tray I heavily greased the pan, left off some of the fudgy topping (just covered the cherry) and lowered the temp to 325, thinking there might be oven variations. Better, but not memorable. 5th tray I added some milk to the dough before forming the balls, (the dough was sticky), heavily greased the pan, used the lower temp, let the  pan cool 10 minutes before removal. A tad better but still some fell apart. Not worth experimenting with to perfect it. So no, I won't make these again. As someone else noted, far too much leftover topping. Kind of a waste.

These were just ok. They flattened out and flavor was nothing exciting. I did use a decorator to put the chocolate on the top and they looked pretty.

I make a LOT of cookies to share with friends and coworkers.  I have never had such an overwhelming response as I did with these!  Everyone absolutely loved them and I did, too.  I did change up the extracts though.  I used equal parts of vanilla, cherry and almond extracts.  Better make a double batch.  These are VERY popular.

Great cookie, I made these for Christmas and used a cookie gun to shape the batter before adding the cherry. I did do red melting candy chocolate on top instead, but they came out beautiful and everyone loved them.

I am not a fan of chocolate covered cherries, but these are yummy!I also added an extra egg and used half cherries.  The dough was very sticky so I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and used a cookie dropper.  I remembered I had some Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers and used those for the icing, and iced after baking - very pretty contrast.  I will make these again!!

Added a little cherry juice to the dough. Sprayed the pans because others said the sauce was sticking to the pan and where it dripped, it did. Used trader joes Morello cherries and they were great. Used dark chocolate in the sauce and glad I did. They weren't too sweet but very chocolaty. Other than the tops being sticky, these were great. I got 32 cookies, not 18 and frosted them before baking.

These cookies were OK, but I wouldn't make them again.  The frosting never did seem to harden.  They were part of a Christmas cookie plate, but didn't turn out as tasty or as pretty as I'd hoped.

Did this recipe for family for Christmas. Everybody loved the cookies. Had a sole request to make these "specific" for just themselves. :) When I first made these cookies the mix was just TOO dry so I added another egg and it came out just perfectly. Also tried with plump blueberries.

A very yummy pretty cookie!  I did add more cherry juice because I wanted to drizzle the tops not cover them with chocolate.  I wanted to see the cherry.  Next time, I might use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.  I want a sweeter topping and the semi sweet still tasted semi sweet...not rich enough.

These were okay, very dry to mix. Think they could be pretty on a Christmas cookie tray, but really not very good. The chocolate overwhelms the cherry flavor by a lot, and is barely noticeable. Doubt I'd make again. Thanks anyways.

My husband loves chocolate covered cherries and these were great.  I did follow some of the suggestions which was add an extra egg and more cherry juice to the frosting.  After making half the batch I realized that you would taste more of the cherry if I cut them up in pieces and mix them into the batter so I did that for the second half of the batter. My husband liked these a bit better since they were easier to eat and got more cherry flavor in each bite.  They weren't as pretty but if I took the time to frost; they would be.  I also had to make the full batch of the frosting in order to frost all the cookies.  GOOD recipe!!

These are exceptionally rich cookies. I did make a couple batches and altered the 2nd batch a little. I made the dough just as stated but added 2 tsps burbon which gives the dough an extra kick of flavor. For the frosting, I didn't use sweetened evaporated milk. I used a substitute which was basically 2 eggs, 1 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt. Then added the rest of the original ingredients. They turned out better than the 1st batch. Which were still awesome! Also, if anyone cares, the cookie dough minus baking soda, laid very thick makes wonderful brownies :)

Delicious. My husband said it's now his favorite cookie. Doesn't make many in one batch so if you want a lot of these, definitely double or even triple.

we love these cookies too.  However I added some Cordial M&M's to the batter before I rolled them into balls.  I think it made them extra special.  I also refrosted them after they came out of the oven and I used milk choc chips instead of semi-sweet. They will deffinitely be on my Christmas Cookie tray this year.

I baked a bunch of cookies for a taste test- I wanted to find a winner to enter the county fair. They weren't difficult to make, but there were a lot of steps. I thought these were pretty good, though they weren't the stand out I was expecting. My taste testers ranked them in the 3rd and 4th spots out of 7.

These are great! I did make some changes though. I didn't feel like doing the frosting, so I added chocolate chips to the batter, instead. When they were cool, I dusted them with powdered sugar. This really made them look festive, for Christmas!

If there were more than 5 stars, this would get them all!  So easy, they look harder than they are, and so good and so impressive!  I cover my cherries totally with the frosting, keeps the cherry from drying out that way.  They're always a hit.

Very yummy! As many suggested, I cut the "frosting" in half and frosted the cookies after they came out of the oven... I still had leftover frosting (but I didn't spoon on, I made the zig-zag design - which was messy! but fun to do).

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange, they are awsome!  I tripled the recipe, and ended up with about 9 1/2 dozen.  This recipe makes alot more than 18 cookie.  I only made a single batch of the chocolate drizzle and had a ton left over.  I will make these again, there like chocolate-cherry heaven!

I made this last year as is and people loved it.  This year, as suggested I added an extra egg to make the cookie softer and everyone said they were even better than last years.  I'll be making this one every year.

These cookies are "da bomb"!! I made them during our yearly baking day last weekend and my friend & I couldn't stop eating them! I'm planning on making them for my work's cookie exchange this year too! I agree with other reviews that you could easily double the cookie part of the recipe & keep the frosting amounts the same. I had tons left over.  Great "gourmet" cookie!!

I follow this recipe to the T..except that I put the chocolate cookie dough into tassie pans...press to make a hole and follow the rest of the instructions. I get three dozen this way and it makes a smaller easier to handle cookie.  This cookie ROCKS!

Very yummy!  I did use 2 T (6 tsp) cherry juice in the frosting, and it still needed more.  Next time I will also add some cherry juice to the cookie.  I think those changes will make it amazing.  I also did add an extra egg to make it soft, and it was perfect texture!

I am cooking and baking challenged and somehow managed to make a decent batch of these.  Mine aren't as pretty as the picture (my frosting was slightly runny) but with practice I'm sure I can work out the kinks, which are all my own.  The recipe is great, it was plenty easy and the results are yummy!  Thanks so much for making me look good!

I love these cookies! They were very chocolatey and sweet, my only wish was if I put 1 or 2 more cherries in the middle... next time. Also, I had a lot extra chocolate icing left over and I put the cookies in 5 mins longer because they seemed too soft at 10 mins. I will be making these again, SO YUMMY!

I also used the half brown sugar/white sugar and doubled the dough but not the frosting.  I took these to a PTA meeting and the response was overwhelming. I made a batch for the kids with marshmallows in the middle rather the cherries. The adults loved them as well. I'm making more right now for the school bake sale.

Heavenly choco-cherry goodness!  What a perfect cookie.  I do recommend that you make them fairly small so the cherry doesn't get lost.  I added an extra egg and then had to stick the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes so I could roll it into balls.  I used 6 Tbsp of cherry juice in the frosting and used most of it since I spread it on the cookie out of the oven as well as spooning it on before I baked them.  Store in a tupperware container in the fridge and they stay soft but the frosting doesn't melt.  Delicious!

Following suggestions, added an egg and doubled cherry juice. Next time I will triple it, but even so, these were super. I'm glad my son took these home with him; they would not have lasted three days with me!

Very good cookies.  I bought a larger jar of cherries than suggested and ended up using most of them.  It took a while to get the cookie dough moist but when I did it was easy to work with.  LOTS of extra glaze though.  You could cut it in half and still have plenty left over.

This cookie is phenomenal! I didn't have cherries so I used marshmallows instead.  I want to try it with cherries next time and maybe I'll even make a batch with raspberry jam in the thumbprint!

I thought that these were really cute, but didn't taste like anything special.  I made them for a temple pot-luck, so I was happy that they resulted in attractive cookies, but if I was picking a cookie for flavor alone, I would pick something else.   Footnote: The leftover chocolate sauce tastes amazing on vanilla ice cream!

I made these for Valentine's Day for my family and they are now our newest V-day tradition! We absolutely loved these. I made more today with generous amounts of the leftover cherry juice and what was left of the sweetened condensed milk, and it was almost as yummy as with the cherries in it. Next time I might try slicing the cherries in half to make them go farther.

These were so good.  I didn't have condensed milk, so I baked them with the cookie and cherry and then after they cooled, drizzled icing over them.  I made the icing out of powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and cherry syrup.  I'd definetely make them again, dh loved them and he doesn't even like cherries.

These cookies are awesome.  I gave them out as Christmas presents this year and I received rave reviews.  I doubled the cookie recipe kept the recipe for the chocolate sauce the same. I also put the chocolate sauce in the cookie first and put the cherry on top

Very yummy. The recipe made quite a bit of "frosting" so I will halve it next time. I will also drizzle the frosting; will make for a nicer look.

These are awesome! The dough was a little crumbly, so I did add some of the extra cherry juice to it, until it was a smoother consistency. I also used a small scoop to make the cookies. I noticed that the cookies I baked on a regular cookie sheet stuck pretty badly, but the ones I made on my stones did not.

O...M...G...  These are absolutely sinful and I normally don't like choc cookies.  I've already made my 2nd batch in two days.  I ran out of cherries and used two blueberries on a cookie and they were awesome, too!  I didn't taste the cherry juice in the icing, and kept adding more juice to get it, but no luck.  I wish I read the reviews first; I'll try adding some cherry juice to the dough.  I also advise doubling the dough--you'll make the 2nd batch anyway!  Because of the excess icing, I decided to make batch #2.  I added more cherry juice to the icing, but I think it was too much.  My cookies ended up spreading a lot, and the only difference was the icing.  I tried one, though, and they're just as good!!!!!  THANK YOU for this recipe! These are AWESOME!!!!

These are wonderful.  I placed the frosting on top to cover the cherry and they are great.  As other's have said you do not need all the frosting.  Double the batter recipe, buy extra jar of cherries but don't double the icing.

These are by far the best cookies on my Christmas gift plates this year! I followed others advice and I used less dough per cookie. I thought they were prettier and more "bite sized" that way. Also, I saved some chocolate to drizzle on top just for the look.

These cookies are Deeelicious!  
We are peanut butter fanatics, so I have this suggestion.  Cream one cup of powdered sugar with one cup of creamy peanut butter until well blended.  Form the mixture into 1" balls and place one ball into the middle of the cookie before baking. Yummmmm!!!  ********** (ten stars)

Really yummy! I used maraschino cherries and canned unsweetened cherries as an experiment. The unsweetened I preferred the flavor (tart) but the maraschino are much prettier because of their bright red color. I halved the chocolate topping sauce and used a cake decorating bag to squeeze strings of chocolate over the top, as shown in the main picture, instead of a dollop of sauce which looked ugly to me. Ended up with a lot of the topping sauce left over as a result. Very pretty cookie doing it this way, and everyone loved the flavor. Next time I will try dried cherries also, as I prefer a tart cherry flavor over the super sweetened maraschino.

These cookies are great - we love them!  A word of caution, however - make sure to only drizzle a little bit of the chocolate sauce over the cherry if you are going to do it before baking.  We made the mistake of drizzling too much and it got all over the pan and then the cookies stuck.  On our second batch we tried just a little drizzle only on the cherry and it turned out beautifully!  Next time I think we are going to wait to drizzle the sauce until after the cookies have baked.

Very good! I added extra cherry juice to the chocolate mixture and made the hole bigger than suggested. I added the chocolate to the hole before putting the cherry to add more flavor. The dough was a little bland by itself, but it wasn't bad and drizzling more frosting on top fixed it easily.

Perfect for chocolate and cherry lovers.  Extremely rich.  My advice, make a double-batch and give some away, the recipients will love you for it.

This is an amazing cookie recipe. First off, I am not a chocolate fan and made these cookies solely for other people. However, after tasting them, I was in love. Oh goodness. I even had a big "oops" when making these--I completely forgot to add baking soda and baking powder, until after I had baked 2 trays of them, and they still turned out great!! Just a little flatter than expected. However the juice from the fruit and the drizzled chocolate made them taste great all the same. I can't imagine how great they would have been had I added the missing ingredients. I did however change up a few of the cookies and added strawberry slices inplace of cherries for a few friends who don't like them. These turned out delicious too.

This is such a great recipe, especially for a "chocolate" holiday like Valentine's. I took them to work and they were a big hit. Great job on the recipe!!

These are very good and I am not ususally a fan of chocolate and cherries.  Mine did look and taste very good.  I got about 20 cookies and I did only make half the "frosting".  I used 6 T butter, 2 T margarine.  I used 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, one egg and almond extract.  I did poor some of the cherry juice into the cookie dough probably 2-3 T.  I did not pat dry the cherries and I placed a small amount of the frosting into the indention before I dropped the cherries into place, then baked them for at least 12 min.( I used a scoop they were a bit larger).  When they were almost cool I drizzled the remaing frosting on the top.  YUM!

The were so rich and delicious.  Like other reviewers, I had way too much icing so I made the indentation extra big.  Since the recipe says it only makes 9 servings, I almost doubled it, but glad I didn't.  I must have gotten 20 good sized cookies from a single batch.  Next time I will add more cherry flavoring.

These cookies are amazing!!!  I made these into a cherry "surprise" cookie by surrounding the cherry with the cookie dough & then baking it.  I didn't tell my kids what was in them, and they were very pleasantly surprised!  I had trouble with the frosting the 1st time I made these, so I used a chocolate glaze the 2nd time.  I just dipped the top of the cookie into the glaze and made a little swirl on top.  These are my family's new favorite cookie! :o)

I doubled this recipe (froze half) and used 1 egg, 2 egg whites, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup smartbalance and whole wheat white flour. I did not double the frosting recipe thanks to the reviews but I still had a ton left over.  The cookies came out very moist and yummy and I will definitely make them again.

Yum! I've made these several times and they always turn out great. The cookie is delightfully fudgy and pairs perfectly with the cherries. I love anything chocolate & cherry, so these are right up my alley. Thanks!!

They tasted good if you like marschiano cherries.  They didn't look so appetizing like what other posters have said.  They all cracked and broke apart but were a lot better after I refrigerated them for awhile.

These cookies were very good. I think they were kind of dry though. Putting cherry juice in the batter would probably make them tastier.Maybe even chopping the cherries and putting them in the batter would be tastier as well. They were a little crumbly when inserting a thumb print for the cherries. My husband liked them. :)

These are delicious!  I served them at a holiday party and my friends really liked them.  The first batch wasn't so pretty, as the chocolate didn't spread easily and sort of clumped on top.  But I added a touch more cherry juice to the chocolate the second time and that made it very spreadable-- much prettier presentation. I'll definitely be making these cookies again!

These were good cookies, although I think they would be better if you make them smaller.  I also added some cherry juice to the batter, to give it more flavor. These are also better after they completely cool or are put in the fridge.

I made these last night testing out recipes for a cookie exchange I'm taking part in.  I did the half white sugar and half brown sugar and added an extra egg to make them more brownie like which some of the reviews suggested and I think that worked good.  They came out okay but they were alot of work so I don't think I'll do them for my exchange since I have to cook 15 dozen cookies for that.

Wow!  Best after they've sat for a day or so.  I used "Cherryman"  jumbo cherries for more cherry flavor and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Also I did apply the chocolate topping after removing them from the oven and it does make for easier cleanup and a better appearance.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are the best!! I love the cherry with the chocolate. I may try cutting up the cherries and mixing them into the dough to get cherry in every bite! I would still put the chocolate topping on the top of the cookie. They are simply delicious!!

I completely agree with all the enthusiastic reviewers! these cookies are heavenly (not if you are dieting, I'll admit). Very impressive with coffee or afternoon tea, a bit wasted on the breakfast table...do not change a thing, even if you are dubious, they turn out as promised!

These cookies were easy to make. I followed the recipe to a T. I was worried that the frosting would melt off the cookie and make a mess, but it didn't. Makes a beautiful cookie. Placed reynolds wrap on cookie sheet for easy removal and clean up.  Made 27 cookies. Will make these again and keep in recipe collection.  Thanks

These cookies were a hit this Christmas. I found if they are small the cherry flavor really is best. The choc topping is super delish! A bit hard to roll, but well worth the effort.

very yummy.  however, next time i would make each cookie bite size so you get a cherry in every bite.  dont let the dough scare you....it's crumbly but turns out smooth when you shape the cookies.

These are really good. Definitely double the recipe, because I only got one cookie sheet full which was not enough for a cookie exchange. Also, if you add more cherry jiuce to the frosting , it comes out tastier and smoother.

I changed the white to brown sugar in this recipe to make the cookie base more like a brownie. Because I found it a little cakey and dry; this solved the problem. Followed suggestions for making indentation with teaspoon and piping the icing.  Have made these a few times now.  I think I have it down.  I don't care for them, because I am not that crazy about cherry.  Everyone else loves them and they are a great holiday cookie.

I have been making these for a Christmas cookie swap for the past couple of years. If you like chocolate covered cherries you will like these cookies. They also freeze very well.

These cookies are excellent; will definitely make again! I  Followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will do what another reviewer suggested, and cover the whole cookie with the frosting.

These are very good cookies, although the consistency is more like cake than cookie.  Still, with the cherry in the middle and the fudgy sauce over the top, they are pretty devine.  I doubled the recipe and they all went!!!!

Excellent cookie! Please note that since the yield stated 18 cookies I doubled the recipe - and I ended up with 8 dozen cookies. Luckily I had some extra maraschino cherries on hand!

I've been making these cookies for the last three years. They are great. Even my brother-in-law, who was a baker for years, loves these cookies and request them all the time. I took it one step further and added cherry juice into the chocolate melt and it gives it just that much more cherry flavor. They are a great cookie!!!!

Thank you Jamie!!!!  My late mother in law made these cookies as part of her Christmas baking every year.  She gave me the recipe years ago and it was somehow lost in one of our moves while my husband was in the army.  I cried when I discovered I no longer had it and was so happy to find the recipe.  My 11 year old made these this Christmas and we all made ourselves sick eating them, lol.  They are wonderful and exactly as I remember with the exception of putting the frosting on before baking.  My MIL always put it on after they came out of the oven and that is probably how I'll do it next year, just for the sake of doing it the way she did, they were still great with the frosting baked on. Thanks again for posting this recipe!!!

Very tasty. I cut the cherries in half because they seemed too big but now I wish I would've left them whole. My son and I finished off the left over "frosting" right out of the pan!! Bake up beautifully. Great christmas cookie recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  My 2 sisters, my neice and I got together and made all of our christmas cookies, and this was voted the best cookie of the day.  I didn't share one of them with my kids when I got home! My only comment is to make sure you make them bit size, any bigger and they are hard to eat.  You have to bite the cherry in half.  Next time I might even try chopping the cherries up and mixing them into the dough then top with the chocolate.  Anyway, great, great cookie!!

These cookies are excellent!  The cherry center gives a perfect burst of flavor and they were so easy to make! My boyfriend and I made them together and he even thought it was easy :)  Everyone loved them and they all want to know when I will be making them again!  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful, I made sure the frosting completely touched the cookie edges before baking, and the more frosting, the better, it does not run.  They tasted like moist brownie cookies, absolutely decadent!  This is a keeper and worth the work.

These were awesome cookies!  I had way too much frosting left over, so I had to make another batch of cookies to use the leftover frosting.  Everyone I gave the cookies to had nothing but good things to say about them. I've got requests to make another batch of them soon!

I lost this recipe several years ago. I am so glad to have found the exact same recipe. It's one the best cookies I've ever eaten and it will certainly make my family very happy this holiday season.
