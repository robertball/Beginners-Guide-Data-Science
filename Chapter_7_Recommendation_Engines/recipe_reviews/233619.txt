Nice recipe. I added more spice & garnished with sesame seeds on top.  To thicken it I added ground flax seed: Healthy & it's nutty taste complements the recipe.

Very nice flavor. I did add a couple of items. Some green bell peppers and a jalape√±o pepper, extra curry and garlic and a can of garbanzo beans to thicken a bit more.

I roasted the zucchini in the olive oil, garlic, lemon and salt before blending. It is not thick, like standard hummus, but still delicious!

I added a generous helping of fresh cilantro and a dash of powdered lemon to kick up the lemon flavor a bit. For the people saying it is soupy, yes. It's not going to be like hummus. It's more like a salsa. One thing that you could try is shredding the zucchini first and sprinkling with salt. Pour the excess liquid off after it has sit for awhile. adjust your salt accordingly. Honestly though, it's great the way it is.

I used extra zucchini from the garden (one of the big ones) and it was surprisingly good!  I think I may like this better than chickpea hummus.

I found this to be very liquidy. Not creamy at all. I even added a can of cooked chick peas as in the original hummus, but still not the same texture.

Great hummus for a cleanse or purification diet where you cannot have garbanzo/chickpeas

I liked this. I thought it was a nice way to use up some of my summer zucchini.  I didn't have any tahini, so I used my seasame oil instead of olive oil and it tastes just great.  

It is a little thinner than regular hummus, but had a nice flavor. Thanks for the idea and recipe!

Pretty good ~ I also used ground flax to thicken it up.  Careful with the garlic ~ it can overwhelm.

Very easy and good. A little watery, but still tasty
