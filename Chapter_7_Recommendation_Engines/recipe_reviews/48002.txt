Delicious! Thanks Tyson. You actually got me to buy your product too. Well worth it. Nice change from the usual dipping sauce. I used ziti too but I think I'd use thin spaghetti or something with a better texture contrast to the chicken next time. I cooked it all in the microwave (cook pasta separately first then assemble and microwave on high about 8 mins.) so I got melted cheese instead of a hard shell. I think I prefer that anyway.

Excellent! I used ziti and it was very tasty. The cheese on top bakes into a hard shell sealing in all of the moisture.
