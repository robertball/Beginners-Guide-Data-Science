This was good! i had slightly less then a pound of turkey and it made 3 burgers. I reduced the amount of ginger as i can tell using fresh ginger that amount may have been over powering for me. I've made lots of turkey burgers and from my experience i have found that you dont even need to bother with the egg (because then it becomes too wet) and then you NEED the breadcrumbs, But it defeats the purpose (to me) when i want to be eating healthier. Also Turkey is very dry so the breadcrumbs suck up more moisture then need be. Just form firmly into patties does the trick , and they hold together just fine. In addition to all the spices i added in 1 chopped red jalapeno (thai chilli pepper would be awesome too).

I used a few variations, dried ingredients and used oatmeal , a little ground chia and sesame oil since I made this with leftover oven turkey.  My kids from ages 5-18 ate it all gone!

It was definitely different than a normal American hamburger but both of my kids ate two patties, said they liked it, and wanted it again. The burger was sweet to me but I ate it. I used dried cilantro so the taste of cilantro was slightly stronger than my preference.  The cilantro hid the onions so I didn’t have to hear my kids whine about having to eat onions so I’ll deal with that :-) I used ginger paste and it worked out fine. Patties were sticky before cooking but cooked well and stayed intact.  Definitely worth trying

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a very pleasant change from Beef, even my husband liked them.  I served them with Tzatziki and a toasted bun.

This was a delicious treat. I loved how it had a kick in it from the soy sauce. Instead of fresh ginger, I've used ground ginger. I've used one Napa cabbage leaf to shred for my toppings. I would love to make it again.

Made these as written with two exceptions. Used ground chicken and grilled on our indoor grill for 8 minutes per side. So delicious! Will definitely be making again.

I skipped the egg and just added a bit more breadcrumbs; it held together just as well. I also cut back on the ginger and green onion, which is fine since the final product was still FULL of flavor. So much flavor that I wouldn't suggest adding any sauces to it other than maybe a little something to add a bite of heat. That, or something relatively bland and creamy, like the tzatziki sauce one reviewer used. I also imagine this would probably be good served in a Bánh mì roll with some cucumber and pickled carrot. No need to add more cilantro, though!

I was trying to find a use for cilantro besides salsa/pico de gallo. This was excellent! I improvised and it was still good.

Meat patty was perfect. I made a veggie sauce with mushrooms but I won't do it next time. The mushrooms don't go well with ginger flavour. Also next time i am going to add some cheese and lettuce :)

I would recommend using 3/4 of a tablespoon of ginger as i could only taste the ginger. I doubled the breadcrumbs and it was still was quite soft. If i make the recipe again, i will proberly consider adding a hiosin sauce in the recipe to make it a little sweeter (but i guess that'll make it a chinese-style turkey burger).
