The boyfriend stopped 3 times to say how awesome the coating was.  The key is definitely as others have said, to flour the fish first - this way the egg/mixture sticks better and you get a better coating.  I could have eaten this without a sauce on the side - the mustard made such a nice addition.  At first I thought it was too much but it really wasn't - after it's fried it's not as potent.  We also threw in some garlic powder into the mustard/egg mixture (if you throw the spices into the potato mixture it will fall to the bottom and never get on the fish).  I used tilapia (apparently they dont carry grey sole or any sole for that matter in Virginia) and only needed 2 minutes on each side for a gorgeous golden brown coating.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight.  I used flour instead of potato flakes, becuase I love the way flour tastes when it fries on the fish. And, it turned out great.  It was so good and my husband really liked it too.    A previou pst said that the potato flakes caused some problems - I suggest using flour instead.

I used orange roughy, Dijon mustard, and Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt.  I baked it in the oven at 450' and it came out crispy with a very nice flavor.

Great recipe! I used flounder but recipe still worked great. I agree with everyone who said coat the fish in flour before the egg mixture.

Ussually, I'm so-so on fried fish b/c I've had some that were too bland or too "fried" but this was fantastic! Best fried fish I ever had and I will never make it another way again!  I only added a dash of salt to the batter and this was perfect. Not a person in the house could remember a time when they had a better fried fish recipe! I can't wait to pass this recipe to my mom. THANK YOU KIMBER for this EASY and GREAT fish recipe!!

Even though I seasoned my garlic instant potato flakes quite heavily, including the addition of parm cheese, this recipe still rates five stars. I floured my tilapia before dipping into the egg mixture which helped the coating to stick. My family flipped over this recipe and my hubby said that the fish was "out of this world"! Nice compliment for both of us Kimber!

Seriously crunchy fried fish - love it! I've made this twice now with the addition of a flour dusting before frying. The mustard takes fish to a whole new level of yumminess that will please both adults AND kids. A major plus is that by using GF flour to dust the fish, this recipe is GLUTEN FREE! I've made it with tilapia and grouper, both worked well. The first time, I prepped all the fish, then put them into the pan. The second time, I had more fish, so dropped each one into the pan as soon as it was coated. That was a mistake. The coating came off a few of the fillets and what remained was little gummy where it met the fish. So for fish perfection, dust all the fillets in flour, then run them all through the first dip/potato dredge, then all of them through the second dip/dredge, then finally fry them up, in batches, if needed. The short resting times between the steps made a REAL difference in finished quality. I let the fish rest on a wire rack, which helps a lot, too. The top of a broiler pan would work as well. The second time I made them I added cajun spice from the recipe for Maple Cajun Mahi Mahi and loved that, too. I put the spices in the mustard/egg dip. Terrific! This is a perfect base recipe for fried fish. The bottom line - the potato flakes, mustard, and rest between steps results in perfect fish! **UPDATE** Made tonight with GF bread crumbs and flounder, only 1 coating. Still super crispy.

This was the first time I have made sole fish, it was great, a very mild tasting fish.  I used bread crumbs instead of potato flakes(didn't have it), dijon mustard(1 Tbspn) instead of yellow mustard.  I also added spices to the bread crumbs - garlic powder and minced dried onions.  I will definitely make this again and add oregano to bread crumbs too.

This fried fish recipe is delightful!!  I had more fish on hand, so I doubled the mustard sauce (2 TBSPs of yellow and the same of Dijon) for dipping after a flour dredge. I am a real, dyed in the wool mustard hater, so that is saying something.    Having said that, I really, really wonder why in the world would any one rating this recipe make it with breadcrumbs and still write a review!!???  I have been cooking 2 to 3 meals a day for years and this is the first one I have seen using potato flakes.  It is one thing to change some of the spices and review a recipe, it is quite another to change the main ingredient, especially such a unique one,  and even consider it the same recipe in order to write a review.  Go figure!!

Made this for dinner tonight. No one really liked it. I am giving it 3 stars because I feel like the blame could be on me, as I tried to make it a bit healthier and baked it rather than fry it. It was really bad. Perhaps the secret is in frying it. I plan to make it again sometime and see if that makes a difference.

Well! I must say,I was excited to find this recipe. All day I was thinking of frying some talapia fillets, so I logged on and searched for a good fish batter. After viewing quite a few,I decided this one sounded the most tasty and unique. I was not dissapointed...My husband, who is quite a cook could not identify the "mustard" ingredient as he was eating...he kept guessing untill I finally told him. The fillets came out crunchy and golden brown as promised! As I had no potato flakes,I used Italian bread crumbs. Also, I fry in coconut oil because it is good for you....bottom line....This is great and I will use always. Just a thought...I bet this would also be great as a batter for FRIED CHICKEN!! Thanks for an interesting and delicious recipe Kimber!  PS-I made a side dish to go with it called "ZUCCHINI TOMATO TOSS" also on "All Recipes" website.

Wow!  This reminded me of the Fish Fries that all the restaurants and hamburger joints in the Rochester NY area serve every Friday!  I double dipped, as suggested, to make the coating extra crispy.  I recommend blotting the filets with paper towels to dry them a bit before dipping in the egg batter, to help the coating stick well.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and it was just fine.  If you double-dip, you will need twice as much of the egg/mustard/salt mixture as the recipe calls for, but no extra potato flakes needed.  Serve with french fries and cole slaw to make the complete, traditional Fish-Fry. Note that this recipe is gluten-free, which is also a good thing! Thank-you, Kimber, for this great recipe!

I love this recipe!  Who would've known that a little mustard would make such a big difference?  After reading the reviews, I did not use potato flakes--instead I stuck with my usual... 1/2 c. all-purpose flour and 3/4 c. cornmeal seasoned with salt and pepper.  The result was great tasting crispy fish filets!  I've used cod, haddock and tilpia with this recipe and they all turned out good. I've used dijon mustard also... still good, perhaps better depending on your taste.  Even my picky 7-year old who typically doesn't eat fish likes this recipe!  Enough said!

Very, very good with white bass.  I did add about 1/2t parsley and 1/4t black pepper to egg dip and dusted the fish with flour before the egg/potato flakes.  Used half butter/half oil for the frying.  Only needed about 1C potato flakes for ~1.5lbs of fish.

I am so happy with this, because I finally found a way to get my 7 y.o. to eat fish!  He won't eat a lot of it, but I'll take what I can get.  ;-)

It turned out perfectly: light and crispy, w/o being greasy or too thick, like many others.  Now, if I could just find more natural potato flakes...

Awesome!  I used tilapia, and only made a few minor changes. I omitted the salt in the egg/mustard mixture, lightly floured the fish prior to dipping in the egg mixture and I added my families favorite seasonings to the potato flakes. I placed it on a lightly spray coated cookie sheet,  then sprayed the top of each piece with a little more cooking spray.   I baked it in a 450 oven for about  10, flipped the fish over, gave each piece another quick spray and returned to the oven for another 2 or 3 minutes. Everyone RAVED about it.  Will definitely be making it over and over and over again!

We loved the crunchy coating, and the mustard gave a great kick to the fish. We added a dash of paprika and some dried parsley to the potato flakes for color. Great change of pace. Thank you for posting.

I rated this a 4, because you really need to add a lot of seasoning to this.  I used flounder, and floured the fish first. Also, I used half potato flakes and half panko.  Overall, a really great recipe.

came upon this recipe due to rain and was going to grill flounder.  I'm so glad I did.  Didn't have yellow mustard on hand (not a favorite in our family)  so used spicey brown mustard and flour instead of potato flakes - didn't have them either.  This was excellent and my husband said he could eat this everyday of the week.    Next time I will try the potato flakes   Thanks for a great recipe.

These were fantastic! I added Cajun seasoning to the egg mixture, then Parmesan and Italian seasoning to the potato flakes (I love LOTS of flavor!). These were crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Yummy!

I HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE POTATO FLAKES, BUT I USED IT ON MAHI-MAHI FILETS. THIS MADE A GOOD CRUST THAT LOOKED GREAT.

Light, crispy, ethereal coating. The flour pre-dip is a must to ensure solid adhesion. I detest mustard, but had to use it out of the curiosity factor, and although the beaten eggs smelled strongly of it, it's not discernible in the cooked product. Used swai fillets, but this recipe would translate out well on any fish that you fry. No trace of oiliness, and the potato flakes cook up with the promised crispness, the taste a fitting backdrop for the mild flavor of the fish. If you like seasoning in your breading, adding it to the dredging flour will maximize its even application to the fish, as if it's added to the potato flakes, it will promptly sink to the bottom of the flakes, usually out of reach of the breading surface. If you want to kick up the heat, adding a dash or two of hot sauce to the beaten eggs will work. Will try this on thin chicken breast cutlets, as well. All in all, a delightful surprise! Edited to add: I just tried this on chicken breast thin cutlets, and it was just as good! Same lovely crunch. Only caveat if you use this on chicken is to be sure your cutlets are very thin. I don't recommend trying this on whole breast halves, as by the time the meat is cooked through, the delicate potato flakes will be incinerated. With the cutlets, I added several dashes of sage, thyme, marjoram and pepper to the initial dredging flour.  Makes superb sandwiches with a dab of mayo, some lettuce and sliced tomatoes, or as a base for chicken Parmesan. Superb!

A favourite.  for those that are substituting breadcrumbs or cornmeal , you're missing the delicate flavours of this coating for a delicately flavoured fish. Adding flour just would make it a pastey mess of a roadside fish and chip shop.      I will admit I did make changes but minor. I reduced the oil to 1 tbsp and added 1 tbsp of clarified butter to my non stick skillet. I also added freshly ground black pepper with some dried dill and dried parsley to the potato flakes.     I tried double dipping and single dipping and we preferred the single dip.  Served with a brown rice pilaf , steamed asparagus and holland side sauce this was perfect.  The mustard was understated and complemented. ( and I don't like yellow mustard on my sandwiches).   I rarely have instant potato flakes on hand, except for camping. (Used last summers leftovers for this) would add this to a gourmet wilderness canoe trip and sacrifice my breakfast egg with my instant potatoes and packets of fast food mustard to enjoy a fishfry at sunset.

WoW!! This was really good!I didn't read any reviews cause I was in a hurry. I made it exactly as posted and I it honestly turned out perfect. Just the thing I've been looking for for an excellent fish coating. I may try coatin the fish with flour first, just to try, but we were VERY happy with the way it turned out. I served it with vegetable rice pilaf :) I think this would make a great coating for chicken too!!

Yes I have tried this Recipe, you would think that using mustard that it would overwhelm the flavor of the fish. Not at all, surprisingly the potato flakes and all of ingredients caught me off guard, it was a great combination that was very tasty. I enjoyed this breading and would recommend it to all, if you need more seasonings, go by your taste. Rev. Thomas

Delicious!! I made mine with exactly as the recipe is written, except that I used tilapia instead of sole. I wasn't sure how strong these would taste with so much yellow mustard, but once they were cooked, I could barely taste it at all. We had ours with a bit of cocktail sauce on the side.

I used 3 tilapia and dijon mustard, no salt. Instead of potato flakes I had bread crumbs. Baked at 425 for 10 minutes. Easy and good.

Wow my 4 year old son loved this fish. I thought it was good but but didn't LOVE it like he did. Will make again and likely add in some additional spices to the potato flakes for a little more flavor.

Great little recipe!  I made as written except used cod because that's what kind of fish I had.  It was nice and crispy.  I'll definitely make this recipe again and again.

I altered this slightly due to what I had on hand. Instead of potato flakes, I used crushed goldfish crackers with a bit of salt, pepper and italian spice added, and like other users said, I dredged in flour before the egg mix. It turned out amazing! My hubby said it was the best fish I'd ever made (and we eat fish at least once a week, so I've made it numerous ways). Thank you, Kimber!

I was surprised at how much I loved this fish.  The mustard taste did not stand out.  I have made this with seasoned bread crumbs, and prefer that to the potato flakes.

I love fish! fried, pouched, steamed, baked, grilled, it doesn't matter. However, when I tried this recipe, I almost quit doing all the above. This fish is sooo crispy and moist. You can't ask for better tasting fried fish. Hmm, in fact, I'm going to cook some up right now for my wife 'n I. Mmmmm

The family loved them!  They were easy and fast.  Used cod and dijon mustard plus some Old Bay and pepper.  Double dipped the fish, still lost some coating but that was my fault for frying too many fish at one time.

I used orange roughy fillets and honey mustard instead of regular mustard and added old bay seasoning as suggested.  Also added pepper, then dredged in Betty Crocker Garlic Instant Mashed Potato Mix!  YUMMY!!  Definitely a keeper!

I was very excited to try this recipe because it sounded SO good!  The grocery was out of sole so I used cod.  The batter didn't want to stick to the fish & when it was done, the taste was VERY bland.  I was disappointed to say the least.  It definitely needs some spices or something!!!

This is delicious and so easy to make!  I have never made fried fish before and it turned out perfectly--just by following the recipe.  I might try coating the fish with flour first since the outside did fall off very easily.  I used my cast iron pan, too, which I think also contributed to this success.  
My husband said this is "restaurant quality."  Will definitely make again!!!

Yum.  I coated fish in mixture of flower salt, pepper & some dried tarragon.  Then dipped in egg mixture, but I used Dijon instead of yellow mustard.  Then dredged in panko breadcrumbs with more tarragon.  Squeezed lemon juice on top after frying, et voila.  So delish.

These were, just as the name suggests, nice crispy fish fillets.  They have a nice, light crust.  I used fresh ono (like halibut), and they came out crispy, tasty, and flakey.   I did not use nearly the amount of mashed potato flakes called for, however.   This one goes "in the book"!

I used this recipe tonight, rolling in flour first, with the potato flakes after the egg, and it was yummy!  My husband loved the crust!  I used cod fillets and evoo but no mustard.  I will definitely add that next time because it needed just a little kick.

Okay Now!! I have just made this for dinner and had to rate this before we ate it all!! THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE WITH FlOUNDER OR ANY TYPE OF FISH!!!! I have made this with Panko crumbs and that is so great too!!! I didn't have to use as much Panko crumbs as for the potato flakes, just a cup for four fillets. AWESOME I AM TELLING YOU!!!! Thanks for the fabulous recipe. Deserves ten plus stars and soooooo fast and easy to make for a quick dinner!!!

Easy but will not make again.

YUMMY!  My husband is a fish-fry aficionado and he loved this recipe!  I didn't think it tasted mustardy at all. I mixed two eggs, the mustard and 1/2 tsp. Old Bay and put it in the fridge for about an hour to blend the flavors.  It came out great and I will definitely use this recipe again!

We don't eat a lot of fried foods but do like fried fish occasionally.  This dish was delicious and extremely easy to make.  You really don't need to add the salt, there is plenty in the mustard and potato flakes.  I had to double up the egg mixture and potato flakes - they just didn't seem to go far enough.  Fries up very nicely.  I served with homemade tartar sauce.

Excellent.  Light, quick, and tasty.  Very good flavor.  Served with just lemon wedges - no need for heavy sauces.  Kids and adults all gobbled it up.  Will try again with different mustards/seasonings.

I followed every single thing except I used wheat crackers that I pounded instead of potato flakes. Big hit with the family! I'll definitely be using this often.

This was amazing. Much better than breading. Very light and crispy. The only thing I did different was use flounder instead of sole, and added a bunch of dried herbs to the potato flakes. I will definitely make this again. Be sure to only do 1-2 minutes for thin fish.

I have made this several times. My family and I really like this recipe. I do what was suggested in previous comments. I dredge the fish in flour that I seasoned with salt and pepper. Then dip in the egg and then into the potato flakes. To my potato flakes I add panko bread crumbs and some lemon pepper seasoning. It works out really well.

I tried this recipe tonight for a small dinner for 2. I think it was fantastic recipe wise but try not to cook the fillets too long. I think about 1 minute each side on high, cooks the fillets to perfection!!

This is a great recipe and my five year old wanted 2nds and 3rds. I made it for lunch and she said this was the best lunch ever. I made a few changes: I used 2 tblsp of dry mustard instead of prepared mustard, I squeezed a quarter of a lime into the egg mixture. I added old bay seasoning and mrs dash. I also dipped in flour first  as others suggested. I will make this again!

Yummy recipe, quick prep. Unfortunately I didn't have potato flakes so I used Italian bread crumbs. I also added wasabi into the mix. Ended up not going very well together :P But still good. Next time maybe I'll use panko breadcrumbs. and replace the mustard completely w/wasabi. Then I can dip it in soy sauce.

I used this recipe as a base, since I didn't want to fry the fish. I also added a couple of other things - minced garlic to the eggs, and lightly floured the fillets before dredging, then breaded with panko flakes and grated parmesan. I cooked them in the oven at 375 for about 15 minutes, they stayed nice and light and moist, really good! I liked the flavor of the mustard with the fish. Great recipe.

Delightful!  My picky boy roomies were really unsure about the mustard, but they loved the fish when it was done!  I used sole filets, and the potato flakes with the mustard were a great combination.  Thanks for the recipe!

I bet this would have been better fried.  I baked it, to make it a little healthier, at 450 for about 10 minutes. It came out crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, but a bit bland in flavor.  I think next time I'll add some spice to it, perhaps Old Bay Seasoning, as has been suggested here.

GREAT. My dish was made with flounder filets. I get them from Sam's Club, and they are nice if you have never got them there. I did as other's said. I used a little flour before dipping in egg mixture (in which I used spicey mustard). I added parmesean cheese (1/2 cup) and two tablespoons of cajun seasonning  to the instant garlic mashed potatoes....excellent, and will be making again.

Pretty good.  I added some pepper to the mashed potato flakes, used spicy mustard and then I baked then broiled to save some calories.  My husband is not a fish lover, but ate this without complaint.

I was worried about the mustard, but this worked out nicely.  I used walleye pike which I had on hand and substituted finely crushed corn flakes for approx. 1/3 of the potato flakes.  I also added a dash of garlic powder and floured my fish before the egg bath as some suggested.  

The mustard and egg bath was very thick so I added a splash of water, and everything worked out very nicely.  The coating was crispy and had a nice flavor, not overpowered by mustard at all...a bit yellow due to the yellow mustard, but nice.  I will certainly use this recipe again.

I made this with walleye filets, dusted with flour before egg wash and used a 1/3 potato flake,1/3 Itlian Bread Crumb, 1/3 Fry Magic mixture for breading and they turned out great.  My two boys who only like the processed breaded frozen fish sticks even went for seconds!! Glad I got that third large filet.  CRISPY, GOLDEN, DELICIOUS!!!

Hubby and I really liked this dish. I made some changes based on reviews and what I had on hand: Used Dijon mustard and also added 1/8 tsp pepper plus 1 tsp lemon juice to the egg mixture. Then I dredged in whole wheat flour and wheat germ instead of potato flakes (we're on South Beach). The fish came out very tasty!

These were very good.  I used talapia fillets.  I also added some breadcrumbs to the potato flakes along with some garlic and parmesan cheese.  I also fried them in olive oil since I was out of cooking oil.  Thanks for the recipe I will make again.

Very crispy but overpowered with potato taste. I used 1/2 plain bread crumbs and 1/2 potato flakes. Also added 1/4 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Double egg dip as per original recommended.

This is the first time that I have made fried fish that it turned out so good!  Even my husband enjoyed it (and without slathering it in tartar sauce!) and he's not a big fish fan.  I used Dijon mustard and added salt and pepper to the dry mix as well as during frying.  I used Talapia with this recipie and served it with a creamy chilled cucumber dill salad...delicious!  Thanks for a new fish recipie!

I really wanted to like this. It sounded so good and when it was cooked, it looked delicious -- crispy/crunchy and golden brown. But it lacked seasoning and was bland. The fillets need to be seasoned before they are cooked. The potato flakes smelled horrible as they cooked and the overall taste of the crust was vaguely chemical. We didn't hate this, but we didn't much like it either. Obviously a lot of people like this recipe, so you might give it a try, but the next time I fry fish, I'll stick to my egg/milk wash and seasoned crackermeal method.

Excellent! I only had a package of frozen whiting fillets. You would never know it was an inexpensive fish that I used. My mom, who hates fish, reluctently tried it, she ate 2 pieces!

Quick and easy, with yummy results! My hubby loved it!  Very crispy and flaky outer coating.  I didn't have regular mustard so I used Dijon, which was just fine. I actually thought that the dish wasn't salty enough (unlike other reviewers) so I will add more salt the next time around. Will definitely make this again!

I am not a fish lover (or liker, for that matter), but I am trying to get my kids to like it.  They loved this recipe, and my 3 year old son, who says he "hates fish!" ate two fillets.
A success, I'd say!

WOW!  This was THE BEST fish I have ever had in my life!  My whole family - even my young children - ate ALL of their meal.  I used Snook that my husband had caught in the Fla. Keys.  Next time I may be creative and use a sauce other than yellow mustard.  I will most certainly make this again!

This was delicious.  I used cod, and omitted the mustard just because I forgot it.  I used a cast iron skillet and these little cod filets were crispy, not dried out, and just lovely.  I will definitely make this again, and next time I will remember the mustard!

Superb!  So easy and super flavorful.  Wasn't sure about the mustard with the fish but it really went well together.  I did use Dijon instead of yellow and EVO instead of cooking oil.  The potato flakes give it an awesome texture.  Want to know how the flakes would work on chicken.... hmmm. Thanks for sharing:)

Really good coating. I used what I had...mostly Panko w/ some seasoned breadcrumbs which I seasoned w/ a smidge of salt, pinch of garlic granules. I also seasoned AP flour w/ Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb and low salt Old Bay. Then I coated the cod w/ flour, egg wash as shown in the recipe then the Panko/breadcrumb mix. Very good flavor, crisped up nice in Peanut Oil. I cut down in over all salt but it still tasted great. One thing I did was absorb as much water from the frozen cod via gravity and paper towels. Made for a much better dining experience than cooking wet fish.

I live on the Texas Gulf coast, and love to fish, so I have made lots of fried fish.  This recipe is now my favorite.  I use it as is, and it is a wonderfully flavorful and crispy coating for sea trout, flounder, whiting, tilapia, or any white, flaky mild fish species.  The mustard adds a mild zing that I love, and the potato flake breading fries up to a delightfully crispy crunch and  golden color.  As others have stated, dredge the fillets in flour first.  I fry the fish in a cast iron skillet and turn the fillets once.

We loved this recipe; crunchy fish is the best!  My only addition to the mustard/egg mixture was a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  This is the best ever use for instant potato flakes which, heretofore, I've been buying just to thicken soups.  Outstanding KIMBER, thank you for sharing!

I didn't have sole, so I used cod, and it was still delicious.  Once the oil was heated, I added about a tablespoon of butter to pan fry.  Super easy recipe, and my husband loved it.

Absolutely delicious with fantastic, mild flavor.  I did nothing different except dredged the fish in some flour prior to the egg/mustard dip. To our taste it needs no additions. Will definitely do this again. Yum!

This came out great. Never thought of instant potatoes for a breading. What a difference. Browns up very nicely with a great flavor. I'll be using this one for a while to come!

Made these crispy fillets as per the recipe with the exception of dredging fillets in flour before the egg mixture.  After the fillets were coated I put them on a platter & placed them in the fridge for 10 minutes to firm up.  Fried them up and the family absolutely LOVED THEM!! Will definitely make them again with the potatoe flakes again - so crispy & yummy

I wasn't sure about this recipe, it sounded a little weird with the mustard. I tried it mainly because I was in a hurry and it came up as one of the first recipes in my 'sole' search and was quick and easy. I did dredge in flour prior to the egg/mustard dip and I used panko instead of potato flakes because that is what I had. It's really good! And it was quick and easy.

Usually, when I cook two things tend to happen: 
One the food gets burned or I get burned. BUT this time everything turn out fine. The fillets came out great!! Everyone loved it.

I was looking for a way to cook flounder that I had on hand and decided to adapt this. I used flour and cornmeal because I don't stock instant potato flakes. I did the double dredge, and rather than making the fish extra crispy, it made the coating extra thick. I'll do it differently next time. The taste however, was great. I may add a little cayenne to the flour for a kick to the fish.

This was fantastic, I love the color the mustard gives the fish. I used flour that I seasoned with garlic powder , Lemon pepper and onion powder....then dredged in the egg mustard mixture. Well will definitely be eating this again !!!!

My kids loved it!  Next time I'll add the parm and it should be perfect.  I wasn't sure if I could use frozen sole, but it came out perfectly.  I just ran it under warm water for a few seconds before dredging it in flour.  Thanks!

I have thirteen year old triplets.  One loved it, one was "okay" with it, and the other didn't like it.  Fish is an aquired taste.  I do not like "fishy" fish, but I loved this.  I dredged in flour, then egg, then flour again before dredging in the flakes, and be generous with the flakes.  I used talipia - the kind that comes in a frozen bag at Target - just let it lay out on the counter for about 30 min. before preparing.  I also used Canola oil, and fried in small batches - 3 to the pan.

I've made this twice. Once baked and once fried. It definitely gets crisper when you fry.  It's a good recipe for coating *only if* you add a lot more seasonings and dredge the fish in flour or cornmeal before the egg mixture.

Just tried this recipe Today and it is awesome.. hands down the best fried fish recipie ever.. i used flounder instead of sole, mixed garlic pepper and parsley in with the egg mixture, and bread crumbs with the potato flakes (sour cream and chive flavored flakes).. i also coated the fish in flour before dipping it in the egg mixture..

The potato crust on the fish really sets it off.  Makes for a nice deep golden brown crust.  Even my husband who generally doesn't like fish said this was a good recipe.  It's a keeper.

Breaded cod wedges with this yesterday for dinner and it was fantastic.  Cooked it in an electric skillet set to about 375' rather than worrying about if I had the burner at the right temp.  I love the zing the mustard gave this, because I was worried it might be too much.  The flavor was perfect, and my husband was able to douse this in the malt vin he loves and it went well together.  My only change was to take the advice of other reviews and shake this in flour before breading.  This was crispy enough with the single coating of breading.  For my tastes, double battering would have been too much.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great way to use the flounder I got on sale.  I also used panko instead of the potato flakes but I thought the flavor was EXCELLENT.  I didn't taste a lot of mustard (I wouldn't have minded!) and I thought it needed just a little more seasoning.  But this was definitely worth trying and I will be making it again!

A good recipe... I used extra virgin olive oil and only 2.5 tbsp at that (my filets were not that big).  I used a Panko coating instead of the mashed potato.  I enjoyed this very much, and it was easy.  I will tweek it a little next time to enhance to taste (I omitted the salt).  Overall the coating did wash out the flavor of the sole a little, but again they were thin filets so that was a factor.  I would recommend this in an instant, but thicker filets would be in order.

I would rate this somewhere between a 4-5. I really liked the way the coating taste as it seemed less heavy than egg and flour batters. I had 1 lb of wild haddock and I used the full amount of liquid, but cut the mashed potato flakes in half. Both were the perfect amount. For the mustard I used dijon. I couldn't really taste it and may try another mustard next time. I might also try adding seasoning to the fish before adding the egg and potato flakes. Make sure to use a good brand of potato flakes that have more weight and texture to them. It is necessary for them to get nice and crispy. I also had to add another about 1 Tblsp of vegetable oil after flipping. The pan looked completely dry after I turned over the fish. Next time, I will also cook the 1 lb of fish in 2 batches. Over-crowding caused a little breakage. I will make this again. ty

Fantastic!!!  This reminds me of the fish sticks I grew up on, but better (and I mean that in the best possible way)!!  If your kids will eat fish sticks, try these because they are really good and not packed with garbage.  I used sole, but I'm sure that tilapia would work great as well.  Honestly, I was stunned when I took the first bite because I am not a natural fish fan.  Excellent!!!

I was a little bit nervous about this one due to the mustard (my daughter hates mustard) but you could barely even taste it, and the overall flavor with the potato flakes was amazing! Will definitely make this again (I used flounder and it came out perfectly).

These were delicious!  The only thing I changed up a bit was to dip the fillets in flavored mashed potato flakes first (Idahoan four-cheese blend, in a small package), then the egg, then the big potato flakes.  I could have eaten it all myself.  Thanks for sharing!

We liked this very much.  I used Tilapia rather than Sole as that was the only fresh white fish that my grocery store had (small town).  But it worked great.  Will make this again for sure.

Delicious! My whole family loved this...even my picky 8 yr old! I added come cajun spice to the egg mixture and floured fillets prior to egg wash. I also used panko instead of potatoe flakes because that was what I had on hand. I even used less oil than called for and the fillets cooked up great in my grill pan. Thanks for the great recipe!

We liked this dish except for my husband. For him, this is just an ordinary meal. But personally, I loved it so as my 3 kids. I followed the original recipe I just added the flour. Dredged the fillet to the flour first, then dipped it to the egg mixture and added garlic powder to it, then to the mashed potato flakes. I will definitely do this again. Thank you Kimber (=

This recipe worked great, feeding my husband and I both while leaving enough leftovers for a 2nd meal.  I had to make a 2nd batch of the egg batter to make it crispy enough and fry the fish on high heat for about 6-8 min on each side, but the end result was great!!

Her in Stow, Ohio I tried this receipe for the first time. Only, i had no eggs at the time so I  used the dijon mustard & a few drops of regular Mustard with some fresh ground pepper and Smart Balance with milk. Then I breaded my fish with flour and then into the ingriedents I mixed up and then I rolled the fish into the instant potaotes  flakes. I then proceeded to pan fry the Fish in Olive OIl. It was delicious! and I would recommend this receipe to all ages who like Fish. Hats Off to the person who has shared this receipe with us.  I will make this receipe again.   God Bless!!

I had also used flour first and then mixed bread crumbs and potato flakes together and baked at 450 and it turned out really good. I would make this recipe again. The flavor of the mustard is mild.

Delicious.  Better to double on the egg wash and potatoes so that the crust doesn't flake away easily while frying.

Tried this last night and it was really good---did dip into flour first,then egg and flakes. I added garlic and onion seasoning to the egg along with mustard. Next time I'm going to try with Dejon mustard.

I thought this was ok but I don't think I will make it again. It was to greasy for us. I much prefer baking the fish versus frying.

The breading was excellent. I think the potato flakes add a lot.  As another suggested, I first dredged the fish in flour, then egg, then the mix, then back in egg, then back in the mix.  It made a thick coating on the fish.  I used cheap storebought cod.  Had I had a good fish it would have been awesome.  Want to try the breading on chicken.

These were good. My 2 year old daughter ate several helpings!! I found them a little boring, but I guess for sole they were good. I dusted in flour prior to the egg mixture and sauteed in organic butter instead of oil. I will likely make again... very kid friendly.

We used tilapia and double-breaded the filets and we really liked the texture and crunch but it needed more seasonings.  Next time I think I'll add more salt.

I loved how crunchy the breading got! I have never achieved that with bread crumbs!I used Talapia.  I would use a little less dijon next time, but that is just my personal taste. This is a recipe that delivers what it says:)

Excellent! I have never been able to fry fish, and tonight I did. Used the advice of dredging in flour first, adding extra seasoning into the egg mixture and did not have potato flakes but used crushed RITZ crackers.  I had those frozen flounder pkgs and sometimes those are really fishy tasting, not this time!

Quick and easy.  I used flounder filets and instead of potato flakes, I used Cracker meal. Also dredged in flour before dipping in the egg mixture.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and everybody really liked it.  I followed the recipe as stated but I did first dredge in flour, then egg mixture and lastly the potato flakes.  I didn't give it a 5 star rating b/c I think it would be better with some seasoning added to it.  Next time, I'll try it w/ some old bay or cayenne pepper to spice it up.  All three of my kids LOVED it!

My whole family loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added some old bay to the fish and did dredge it in flour like others have suggested.  The instant potatoes give the fish such a crispy golden brown crust.  It turned some ordinary cheap fish (flounder in my case) into something delicious.  Thank you.

Based on taste, how quick and easy it is to prepare, and the fact that it's a very inexpensive meal (Dover Sole was on sale at Ralph's today, so my complete meal cost about $2.00!), this recipe deserves 10 stars! I followed another reviewer's advice of dredging the fish in flour first, and another's advice to serve it with Tartar Sauce IV (although my husband wouldn't taste the tartar - he insisted the fish was perfect without it). Thanks, Kimber, for a GREAT recipe!

I was so excited to try this recipe after reading the good reviews and seeing how easy it looked. I just made it, and I did not like it at all. It just tasted like bad fishy tater tots...but maybe some people like that taste. Who knows...you may like it. So don't just go by what I say. I'm just writing what I think. Happy cooking.

Yummy! I added some dried onion flakes and dried parsley in with the potato flakes. I also did the light coating in flour before putting the fish in the egg mixture - as suggested by others. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. My husband and little girl and I all loved it! Delicious and so easy!

This was a messy dish to make because of the potato flakes. It tasted better when I fried them until they were well-done. The potato flakes made the fish taste more like a mashed potato....not bad flavor though...

Great recipe! I followed recipe except used dijon instead of reg mustard and used garlic salt in place of regular salt and added a bit of cayenne. I had a lot of the flakes leftover so perhaps reduce flakes to 1 cup.

These are fabulous! My whole family loved them. Just a few changes - I lowered the mustard to 2 tsp. so it wouldn't be overpowering, and a bit of flour and a generous shake of Old Bay seasoning to the potato flakes. Without some spices you may find it a bit bland.

I made this with ocean perch.  I didn't care for this very much.  It wasn't terrible.  I just didn't like the  
strong yellow mustard taste.  It was a little unusual with fish.  Maybe it would be better with dijon.  I did like how crispy the potato coating turned out.

I'm sorry to say that this didn't come out as good as I had hoped.  It was too soggy and DH and I didn't care for the flavor at all.  Sorry, but I don't think I'll make this one again.

I decided to make this recipe because I had some fish in the freezer and it has received great reviews. I was very excited about it. I did decide to use dijon mustard instead of yellow. I even added a little extra than it called for so I would taste it more. Didn't work at all. It tasted like I was eating mushy hashbrowns. The potato flavor was overwelming. I couldn't taste the mustard or even the fish. It was like eating potato pancakes. My fiance hated it. For me, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good.

This was good.  No one in my family really likes fish, but they ate it. My husband who does not eat red meat, really loved it.  I liked it, but definitely does need extra seasoning.  I added hot pepper sauce to my eggs and cayenne pepper to the potato flakes, but it still needed more.  I will make again.

The 3 rating is probably because our family is not a big fan of cod but I may try the coating with halibut instead.

This is fabulous. I'm not a fish lover, but my husband is. When I printed out the recipe, I had him in mind. I bought whiting fish and this evening I prepared the meal. As I was preparing it, I thought, no way am I going to eat this. I opted for extra crispy breading by dipping in egg and potato flakes twice. OK, it looked delicious. My husband was raving about it. I had to try it, of course. I couldn't believe it. DELICIOUS! I had two pieces. I served with spinach salad. Thanks Kimber for this recipe.

It was good but I will nix the salt next time. Probably all of it. It was almost too salty to eat.  We had to scrape off the coating just to eat the fish.  Mustard was a good idea though.

This is a very good recipe. My husband loves fish and I don't, so I don't cook it very often and when I do, it's a great suprise for him. I used catfish strips (I have a phobia about raw fish)and not only did hubby love them, cut I ate several pieces myself.  That's a very hight score, believe me.

My husband doesn't care for mustard. I prefer a more crispy crust.  It was OK.

Very good. Loved the tenderness and crunch. Personally I’d add more seasoning to mustard and egg but very good moist and crunch

It’s a good start but I’d definitely add some kind of seasoning. Just going by the recipe as is the fish will almost taste like nothing although the texture is on point. I added paprika garlic salt and a healthy portion of Creole seasoning and it turned out perfect! 
Side note I used tilapia because that’s just what I had on hand.

i thought about 3 stars  because of the potato flakes, but it wanst
efficient to  cook and mash potatoes for this, besides i dont think it would make breading so  even  i used something instant.. anyway i tried it both ways  extra  crispy  and regular.  i didnt notice enough  difference to go with the extra crispy.i used fresh fillet of  red snapper
which i had on hand.  i think cod would  work,  i just wsnt in the mood for a flaky fish   david

After reading many review, I decided to alter the recipe as suggested to dip in flour first, then egg mixture and finish with a mixture of potato flakes and Pablo crumbs.  We loved it!

Instead of potato flakes I finely crushEd potato chips, floured, egged and rolled in the crushed potato chips. The chips gave it so much more flavor.. the salt and vinegar chips goes very well with the fish. We ate it so fast I couldn’t get a picture. Try it you’ll like it..

I loved this fish...
Dredged in flour first...but definitely use the mashed potatoes   ..unique and flavorful....I used garlic mashed
I also only used 1 large tbsp of mustard...2 seemed too much with only 1 egg...and I added parsley to egg mixture
Will definitely make this again and try various flavours with Dijon or other spices    mmmmm

Cannot believe how light and crispy the flounder came out.  I prepared the fillets and left them on a cooling rack for about ten minutes while I made the rest of dinner — and I think that’s the trick to crispy.  As other reviewers did, I lightly floured the fish before the egg dip.  Next time, I’ll cut back to maybe just a Tb of mustard, or skip it and try some herbs.  I can see using this for any kind of fish, shrimp, chicken.

My family loved this recipe, even my youngest who is not fond of fish. Like other reviews, I dredged the fish in  flour first and then I used crushed ritz crackers for my breading and  Dijon mustard in the egg mixture. Next time I will add more Dijon to give it a little more zing!

Very yummy, made exactly as written.  I only had enough egg batter (used to "large" eggs (which are pretty small IMHO) to double coat 3 of the 4 fillets (flounder). The single dip was just as crispy. I will definitely make again with other cuts of fish.

I added a little coconut oil to the vegetable oil when I fried it which added a nice subtle sweetness. Also used garlic salt instead of regular salt which also made it delicious.

It's the mustard! Because of the gluten I use potato flakes but I also use crushed pork rinds and both are delicious. I also dredge in corn starch before the egg mix.

These were very good! I gave 4 because I used cod fillets. We don't have much selection for fish in small town Texas.  ;) I'm sure it is a 5 prepared per the recipe.  I would have given 5 but I've seen so many complaints about people giving 5 when they made changes. They were very crispy!

I didn’t have any mustard so I would add that next time.  I needed a little more salt for my taste but can salt to taste when done cooking.  Very crisp and light tasting crust.  Will cook again.

Definitely will make it again!!!  Used wild caught orange roughy.  Trying to cut back on carbs so instead of potato flakes used 1 cup almond flour and 1/2 cup shelled hemp seed.  As recommended, dipped in egg/mustard/salt mixture then almond/hemp seed mix then did it again to give it a thicker coating.  My husband and I loved it!  Thank you for the recipe.

I used this recipe for halibut.  I thought the mustard flavor came through too much for such a mild flavored fish, but my husband thought it was delicious.  If I make this again, I will try it  with cod, and reduce the mustard.  Also, I didn't read other reviews until after making it.  I would also coat the fish in flour before dipping in the egg.  I usually use panko, and will continue to do that for halibut.

I had 4 flounder fillets. I made the recipe as directed, could have used more egg mustard dip.  The potato flakes did make a nice crisp crust . I thought just a tad more flavor would have been good.

What a wonderful recipe for fish! As others have suggested, I dredged fish in flour first. And for a twist, I used 1 TB Dijon rather than yellow. Delicious. Thanks, Kimber!!!

Baked Broccoli on the side. Thank you soooo much .

This was terrific although I did not use potato flakes, it's just not something that I keep on hand.  I used Panko with a tablespoon of olive oil and an additional teaspoon of salt.  I used haddock, it was the fresh catch (that's how we shop in Maine). It was yummy!

this is my recipe for perch and pickerel. use-egg, flour and dusted ritz cheese crackers. put fillets in flour, then egg into the cracker mix (add spices to crackers). deep fry till crisp-you will find the grease is deflected because of cracker mix. let drip after removing -grate but no paper towels-serve and enjoy-not reccommended for ocean fish.

So easy and delicious!
I made it crying with grapeseed oil (tasteless and very healthy). 
I sautéed some sliced almonds in the oil and served them on top of the fish so it became ‘almandine.’
Nex t time I may serve with a side of homemade applesauce as I think this would complement the dish very well and I may make some string beans almonds eggs as well.
As everybody says, you’d think the mustard would be overpowering but it wasn’t.  
Thanks, Kimberly, for the easiest fish dish ever!

For my family, this is a good start.  We didn't have sole, so we used flounder.  I'm also gluten-free so I used potato starch as the flour which provided a decent crunch.  It was just bland for us.  I even added garlic powder to the egg mixture as suggested by others.  I will be tweaking this for us with some more seasoning in the breading.

A few changes, but this is a real keeper recipe.  I  used Haddock....oh man, it was so good!  Used a little flour to dust,  and Dijon mustard rather than yellow.  The fish was a little thicker, so I finished in a 375 oven for about 8 minutes.   

While it was in the oven, I drained most of the oil from the skillet, added a little butter, and let it brown.  Then added fresh lemon juice.  Reduce .  I didn't want to make the crispy coating soggy, so I drizzled the sauce on some arugula, then put the fish on top of that.  Yum!

what a wonderful recipe,  I did follow some of the comments in the review section.  I used the flour instead of the potatoes and coconut oil.  Totally success at home, plus is very easy and fast.

Dredged fish in seasoned flour, then followed recipe exactly. I didn't taste the mustard itself but the fish was tasty. Watch so you don't over brown the coating. Everyone enjoyed it, even the picky 7 year old and toddler. It's simple and tasty; I'll definitely make it again. (I cooked 3 pounds of fish and did need to make another batch of egg and mustard beyond what the recipe suggested for that amount of fish.)

I used bread crumbs because it was all I had in the kitchen. I don't know if there would have been much difference in the flavor if I had potato flakes on hand. It was bland, and I even took some time to season the fish with salt and pepper before dredging it with flour, then the egg&mustard mixture. Good thing I had made some garlic mayo dip as a back up . Definitely needs more seasoning.

I 've been trying to find a fish recipe that the hubby will eat and this will be one if them. I like fish with potatoes so I tried this out. I used Dijon cause I had it and flounder.  Otherwise I did everything else the same.  The hubby, both in-laws and all four kids loved it.  The potatoes were crispy and it was easy to make.

It was OK.  We didn't care for it as much as a batter-dipped filet.  The potato flakes got tricky to handle once fingers got wet.  All in all, think it's a useful technique when other options aren't available.  Would make again, although we don't fry fish very often.

All I could taste was potato chips.  The coating was crunchy but tasted like plain, stale potato chips..  Maybe if I had some tarter sauce in the house I could fool myself into thinking i was eating New England fish and chips...

So easy and SO good. I've never fried anything on the stove top before so this was a good start. I dipped the fish (Talapia) in flour per others recommendations, before dipping it in the mustard/egg coating and used 1 c. of potato flakes and 1/2 c. of Parmesan cheese along w/ the salt and added some pepper for the outside.  It turned out great. My husband and I both loved it. I'll definitely be making this again...soon.

We liked this one and I’ll definitely make it again!  I did make some changes as follows.  As suggested, I dredged my fish in flour first.  I decreased the salt by half and only used a scant amount of the potato flakes – just 1 oz., weighed out on my food scale, for two tilapia filets.  And rather than using all the oil, I only used about a tablespoon to pan sear the fish.  I started with my burner set between medium and medium high and after four minutes, the potato flakes were almost burned.  I flipped them and immediately turned the burner down to medium low, however the burner and pan held enough residual heat that the second side nearly burned as well.  They were salvageable and we still enjoyed them, but next time I will start with a much lower heat setting to hopefully achieve a nice golden brown crust.  I served this with McDonald’s ® Tartar Sauce Copycat, also from this site.

Do yourself a favor and read the least positive reviews first, before you make this! I unfortunately did not do that.  The only good thing about this recipe is that the breading sticks to the fish really well, and when it's done it looks like it's going to be delicious; I can assure you it looks better than it tastes. Definitely would not recommend this recipe :-( very dissappointed

Great recipe. I used Tilapia fish, dipped the fish in Spelt flour before dipping it into the egg mixture and used plain bread crumbs instead of the potato flakes and it turned out great.  I didn't even have to use ketchup to give it more taste, it had enough on it's own.

Crispy fish! It was a hit with my family.  Even my son, who normally doesn't care too much for fish, went back for seconds.  I fried it in coconut oil, and dipped in flour before egg like others suggested.  This one is a keeper!

This was a good recipe! As other reviewers recommended I coated the fish in flour first, and I used tilapia as the grocery store did not have sole. It turned out tasty! I also used a second egg because I added the mustard to tne egg, but I'm glad I did because one would not have been enough. Next time I will salt the fish first because I only got pockets of flavor with it in the egg. Thanks for a great keeper!

Very Good! I've made it a few times now. My husband and son enjoyed it.My 16 year old asked me to make it again. So then, I knew it was a winner in my house. I also dipped in the flour prior to the mustard/egg mixture.

Flour first, as per other reviewers.  Have never had such a crispy coating (that stayed!) on fish.  Really good, though I think next time I'd up the seasonings in either the flour or the potato flakes.

We really liked this. The batter came out a little eggy like a pancake almost. Although they were crispy I missed the flaky crunch like you get with panko. Still very tasty though!

Maybe I did something wrong, but my family really didn't care for it! I double coated it, and the breading wasn't crunchy at all!! I ended up peeling the breading off the fish and tossing it!!! If I'd try this again I'd never double coat again!!

Had some catfish fillets and used this recipe. In order to double-coat the fillets after dredging in flour first, I had to double both the egg mixture and the coating (I used bread crumbs since I had no potato flakes). Personally, I prefer a little less mustard flavor and will probably try cutting the amount of mustard in half next time I make it. This is another great option for how to fix fish. Fried it 5 minutes per side and it was golden brown and crispy on the outside, flaky and tender inside. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe!  I used pollock fillets, floured them before dipping in the egg mixture and only added salt and pepper to the potato flakes as seasoning...they were unbelievably light, crispy and super tasty.  Highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe!  I also floured the fish first as others did.  The mustard added a really nice flavor to the coating.

I really liked how moist and juicy the fish was, and was pleased that it was quick and easy to make.  However, I found the taste too bland.  I should note I made some substitutions to the original recipe: first I dipped the fish in flour as suggested in other posts, then I dipped in the egg mixture, then in bread crumbs (I didn't have potato flakes).  I will make the recipe again, but will definitely experiment by adding herbs and spices to the crumb layer.  The mustard wasn't as zesty as I hoped.

Love it!!  I'm so used to cooking fish in bread crumbs, this was such a great change.  Only changes were dredging in flour first and adding 1/2 tsp of garlic seasoning.  They came out so crispy!

This is a great recipe,my husband & kids loved it! The potato flakes really make this dish! I used Flounder. I did tweek a little. I used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow,added Johnnys Garlic Seasoning (Costco) & paprika to the recipe. I also deep fried in olive oil..So Yummy!

Family loved it - the mustard mix smelled so strong they were worried, but it tasted just right!  I followed the recipe, but did flour the sole fillets first to help the topping stick.   Sole is expensive, so it was great to find it on sale - this recipe is a keeper.

These were surprisingly good! My husband actually found this recipe and wanted to try it - I wasn't sure about it, though! (He REALLY  liked these) I used flounder because the supermarket did not have sole.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for dipping the filets in flour first.  I also doubled the egg mixture.  Very tasty and crispy.

This recipe was very good.  We thought the potato flakes were a little bland, but that can be fixed.  I did dredge the fillets in flours before the egg mixture and then the potato flakes.  They cooked up nice and crisp!  Thanks!

This was great because it was quick and easy for me to make for my girlfriend and little cousin. I bet it would be just as good and much less calories if you fried it just with the eggs and mustard mixture without the potato flakes. My mother does the same thing with Eggplant and I'm willing to bet you can do it with this recipe too.

Definitely great recipe - I don't like fish unless it's white, flaky and very mild so I used Haddock and it turned out delicious! - I added bay seasoning, Italian seasoning and salt to the flour and dipped in that first.

It is the method, not kind of fish.  First time I did this with flounder which were very thin fillets;  second time, Swai which is thicker.  Delicious both times, just the time had to be adjusted.

I am giving this a 3 for tast and a 4 for ease.  I think it would have been better using some seasoning with the potato flakes because it had a very "potato" taste.  I was also not crazy about the flounder that we used.  It was semi-fishy tasting.  I think I will try again using tilapia and seasoned mashed pototato flakes.

I made this for dinner and got rave reviews from my family. I added garlic,parmesan and seasoning to the mustard mixture. I also dipped in flour/potato then mustard and back to flour/potato mix which made a nice crust. I will definitely be cooking this again! It's great, Thanks!

This was delicious and easy for a quick weeknight supper.  I did not add salt and didn't miss it.  Otherwise, made exactly as stated except used Dijon mustard (all I had on hand).  The one piece left over did become a little soggy in the frig.

I used flounder and tripled the egg/mustard mix in order to have enough to coat the fish. This was so delicious my mom (not a fish fan) asked me to make it every week. YUM YUM YUM! It was so flavorful it didn't even need tartar sauce.

Wow, this was great. I used cornflakes, but I think panko would have been even better if I'd had any on hand. We used 4 oz. flounder fillets, not great in themselves, but tasted terrific with this simple coating. I did find that this wasn't enough mustard coating for my fish, so I would make more next time.

I love catching and eating Flounder, but do not always enjoy cooking the fish. This is my favorite fish recipe so far and I have tried a bunch. Only substitution was using a pouch of Betty Crocker instant mashed potato mix. Only addition was a little onion salt. Thank You for posting!

I agree with a few of the members comments as I am not really fond of a lot of fish, This recipe was very good as we follow the recipe from one of the other photos posted and used fine corn flake crumbs instead of the potato flakes.
This is very good, the fish is nice and light and crunchy.

I love this recipe, I use it all the time.  I like the fillet of Sole, but I prefer to cut up Catfish into smaller pieces and use that instead.  It always comes out crispy and tasty, even my kid who's extremely picky will clean his plate.  It does have a pretty strong potatoes taste, but I love potatoes and don't mind it at all.  Great recipe, I will continue using this one over and over.

Even though I thought this fish was good and rather easy, I can only give it 3 stars.  My 5 year old picked all the coating off, and my 18m old refused to eat it at all.

I used polock instead because that's what I had and used a german horseradish mustard. Will make again.

Fantastic!  I used flounder and found I needed two eggs, so I used 3 tbs of mustard.  Added a pinch of garlic powder, too. Also dredged filets in flour before the egg.  My 12 year old daughter refuses to ever eat fish ~ but she loved the smell of it frying (in olive oil) and tried it.  She ended up eating 3 filets!  So easy and delicious.

Love the idea of using potato flakes for breading. Quick and easy, tasty spin on flounder.

This was so yummy! I'm a girl raised on southern fried catfish who got an English stepdad late in life who introduced me to fish n chips, and this is a great mix of the two! Pan fried, but crispy without being super greasy.

I only had potato 'buds' versus potato flakes, but much to my surprise they turned out great.  ( I had onced used the potato buds in a baked fish recipe that didn't turn out too good).  This time I used the deep fryer. 
Very easy and quick recipe.

Excellent! My son who is a mustard lover thought the mustard taste was wonderful. I personally would prefer a less pronounced mustard taste and would decrease the mustard by half. The breading was great, needs no additional seasoning.

I have never had luck pan frying anything with breading and thought the tip about double dipping it (egg then breading then egg then breading) worked great! Other than that I thought that the recipe needed more flavor. I added Italian seasoning and dried parsly to the potato flakes and used dijon mustard instead. Next time I will add some other spices. Still a great, very easy recipe.

Looking at the reviews, I was expecting a better tasting dish.

This tasted like potato flakes and the mustard gave it a slightly bitter flavour.

Not a hit.

A really simple recipe that has common fridge ingredients. I substituted the potato flakes for bread crumbs and still turned out good.

These were very good but I don't think that I will use the mustard next time.  I put lemon juice with the egg and seasoned the potato flakes with Adobe.  We made fish sandwiches out of them with lots of tartar sauce and they got rave reviews.
