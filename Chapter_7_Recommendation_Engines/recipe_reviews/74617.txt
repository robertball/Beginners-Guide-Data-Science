Great recipe! My husband loved it! I made a few alterations to give it a little more of a kick. In the sauce, I added Oregano, Italian Seasoning, freshly pureed garlic, fresh ground pepper and diced onions.

We thought this pasta dish was yummy, although we ommited the sausage at the beginning, and threw in three quarter pound of shrip at the end.  I didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes, and so I tried to food process a can of diced tomatoes.  If anyone ever tries this, please, please drain the tomatoes first.  Whirling tomatoes creates plenty juice.  THis was a great basic recipe though.   Thanks.

Nothing too spectacular. It was fast to make but it just really doesn't scream "cook again"

This was okay.  I think it would be much better if you stopped after step 2, added some olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper and tossed that with the pasta.

Very good recipe. Drained the tomatoes like the reviewers advised and added more red pepper and oregano. Delicious meal!! Used smoked italian sausage from the night before and we loved it!! Will definitely make again.

I strongly suggest draining the tomatoes even though it is not explicitly stated in the recipe.  Ok.  Needed something.  I did not inlcude the sausage and found it to be runny.
