The directions on this recipe are confusing.  I did not drain the water off my potatoes before adding the other soup mix and therefore it came out really watery....make sure to drain your potatoes!

Fantastic! Much quicker than my normal recipe. My hints: To ensure it's not too thin, cover the potatoes with just *barely* enough water. I used powdered chicken broth instead of just water -- added a lot. A stalk or two of celery is a great addition. For more depth of flavor, add a dash of worchestershire sauce. Oh, and if you use red or yukon potatoes, you don't need to peel them!

Yum! I did doctor the recipe a bit to accomodate our tastes, but the base recipe is perfect. I don't like onions - left that out. I read some of the other reviews and thought that the celery salt sounded good. So I added salt, pepper, celery salt, and garlic powder to the potatoes while they were cooking. I then added a bit more pepper, celery salt with the dash of Thyme when I added in the milk/soup. I stirred in about 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese before serving. Garnished with additional shredded cheese and crumbled bacon. It was sooo very good. My boyfriend went back for seconds - that never happens. Later that night he told me he can't wait for lunch the next day so he can have leftovers. I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks!

I am a huge potato soup fan.  So I was a little unsure as to how good this would be.  This might be my favorite potato soup EVER!  We all loved it.  I covered the potatoes with just enough water to cook them and I didn't drain the water (like the other person said) it wasn't necessary.  Plus, that would've drained off the onions.  Instead of 2 1/2 cups of milk, I used 1 1/2 C. and 1 C. of sour cream and 1/2 C. of cheese.  When serving I added the bacon and more shredded cheese.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

this is so good, i love how easy it is - made just a few changes, i chopped up bacon before cooking it, and let it cook about 1/2 way then added the oinion and a healthy spoonful of garlic and let the oinions brown, then added the potatos to the mixture and sauteed them for a few minutes... used chicken broth to cook potatos in, and used cream instead of milk

REALLY good.  I added chopped celery and cooked them with the onions in the bacon grease (that step has a LOT to do with the great flavor).  I also lowered the milk to 1.5Cups, added a cup of sour cream and stirred in 1C of Cheddar just before serving. EVERYONE loved it, and the leftovers were great too. 
Adding to original review: I was short on time, so I didn't cube the potatoes (just cut into big chunks), but right before adding all the creamy ingrd's, I used a potato masher to smoosh up the softened potatoes.  Worked GREAT, and made the soup nice and thick!
Also, I've saved some bacon grease so when I don't want to use (or have) bacon, I just use the grease when cooking the onions and still get the great flavor!

Awesome soup!- I made several changes, however.  I did not use bacon at all; I sauteed onions, chopped mushrooms, and chopped garlic in olive oil.  I added the cubed potatoes to this and boiled for about 20 min.  Then I added the condesed soup which I had mixed with only 2 cups of skim milk.  I then added the ground black pepper but no dill.  Everyone agreed that it was delish!

Very good and flavorful potato soup. Here are the changes I made: 3/4 cup onion, half of bacon in soup and half as a topping, 1/2 tsp. of dill weed, 1/2 cup mild cheddar cheese, and DON'T FORGET THE SALT :) This, in my opinion, brings out the flavor in this soup.

Excellent! I was out of onion, so I used a little dehydrated onion to still get the flavor and I used a whole package of bacon. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes. I also topped the soup with shredded cheddar cheese and chopped green onions which made it a cheesy potato soup. It was DELISH! Even my picky kids gobbled it up.

Very fast and easy, I'll definitely be making it again.

this recipe is how i have basically made potato soup for over 50 years.  for those who thought it was not thick enough, just add some instant potatoes while solution is HOT.  in fact, instant potatoes can be used to thicken most any dish.

I followed the directions and didn't add anything save for a few extra slices of bacon.

The soup turned out very well as designed.  Next time I may try adding more ingredients to change it a bit.

Had to adjust this recipe for v.picky eaters.  Used full amount of bacon & potatoes. Cut bacon fat, soup, milk, onion,& dill weed in half.  Used some leftover chicken broth for some of the water. Mashed some of the potatoes w/ a fork to thicken a bit. Added red pepper flakes.  It was a hit & now w/ my favorite recipes.  Might try it w/ cheese soup or ham next time.

Amazing! I did mash the potatoes as I don't care for the consistency of chunky potato soup, but doing this makes it almost identical to my favorite Irish restaurant's potato soup. Of course, the addition of bacon and cheese (I took others' advice and added it as a garnish) made it a little more "American" but you can't go wrong with those two ingredients on anything. This is going into my monthly rotation for sure! Thanks Amanda!

Adding cheese and some extra spices (paprika and garlic salt) makes it perfect!  I added 3/4 cup of cheese and drained most of the water off of the potatoes before adding to the milk/soup mixture.

So delicious! I replaced 1 cup of milk with sour cream.  I used red potatoes and put two chicken boullion cubes in the boiling water with the potatoes. I also added shredded cheddar along with the bacon before serving.  Many, many compliments when served at a church fellowship meal!

TO MAKE THIS EVEN BETTER CHANGE THE FOLLOWING:
No dill weed at all
Instead of 2 1/2 cups milk... use 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup sour cream.
Add 1/2 cup chedder
Add 1/2 cup milk
Instead of water use chicken broth to cook potatoes
Add a few shakes of paprika, poultry seasoning, thyme. 
Also add 3-4 cloves of crushed fresh garlic. 
Use full package of bacon instead of 3/4.
Sprinkle more cheese

TRUST ME... ITS MUCH BETTER!

Used cream of celery and cream of mushroom, and added spinach and cheese at the end.  Not my favorite, but still pretty good.

Excellent soup! I made a few changes, as did many of you! I used turkey bacon (I served with a BLT salad); used less onion (I don't like onion very much) and instead of cream of chicken, I used Campbell's cheddar cheese soup as my base. I also used half and half instead of milk. It turned out delicious! My husband decided this is a keeper!

This was delicious!  The only change I made was I used chicken broth instead of water when cooking the potatoes.  I served it topped with crumbled bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and chopped scallions.  We can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!

The recipe is great but it left out that you are supposed to drain water from potatoes. So I added half a block of low-fat cream cheese worked like a charm and was delicious

This recipe is delicious! I made a few changes based on the other reviews & it was a family hit!!  I made the change of using chicken broth instead of water to cook the chicken in.  I also used 1 cup of heavy cream & 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of 2 1/2 cups of milk.  I addded 1/2 cup of cheese & 1/2 cup of milk.  I also mashed the potatoes after cooking.  Great recipe!  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

My family loves this recipe. I tweak it just a little by adding a whole pound of bacon and the bacon grease. I also add garlic salt/powder. I also add a couple more potatoes to make it less runny and more creamy. I throw some cheese and crutons in everyone's bowl and they all enjoy.

4 1/2 stars. Good base for potato soup. Needs a few more spices, but still good.

This was a great soup.  I used turkey bacon for lower fat content, and sauted the onions in a small amount of  water.  I added more cheese than suggested, as my family likes more cheese.  I also added cauliflower.  I boiled it with my potatoes, along with chicken bouillon.  I used cream of celery and cream of chicken soup.  I also used some heavy cream with the milk.  I served it with grilled ham and cheese sandwiches.  What a great meal, will definetly make again!

Good- but needs a little more "umph" i cooked 8 slices of bacon then removed from heat.  I then cooked onion in bacon grease with garlic, and then added 5 red potatoes cut into cubeswith skin. I added water, CORN, celery seed, and salt and pepper and cooked for 20 minutes until potatoes were soft. Then, I DRAINED the mixture and put it into a pot with milk and canned soup, with bacon pieces, small cut turkey sausage, and cheddar cheese added. I let the soup cook on low for 10 more minutes. Yummy!!

Loved it!  I did follow the suggestions of 1.5 c milk and a cup of sour cream.  I also added corn, peas, and carrots to make it more of a chowder.  I also added a dash of thyme and a tbs. of pepper.  I like it peppery!  We loved it!

Tasted wonderful!!! I substituted low-fat turkey bacon and that got rid of the bacon grease. i just cooked the onion in a non-stick pan with a little non-stick spray. Still tasted excellent.

Raves from the family. I did take ideas from the others. Writing this down so I can remember what I did for next time.
Sauted onion and celery in butter, then added chopped ham (two ham steaks). Then added frozen diced potatoes and covered with with just enough chicken broth to cover, along with some minced garlic. Used one can cheddar cheese soup and one can of cream of chicken with 1 1/2 cups milk-nice and thick. Didn't need the extra salt, but generously added black pepper and added some poultry seasoning (I forgot it said dill). DELICIOUS. Family said this was better than my other potato soup recipe!

Love this recipe!!! Quick is right! It has become a hit in our family! I read other reviews and decided to use chicken broth to cover potatoes, added celery, milk/sour cream combo that someone suggested,  mashed the potatoes after cooking with a masher and added cheese.  The only twist I put on of my own was to use white american or monteray jack instead of cheddar.  I have had it with all three and prefer the whites. Mostly for presentation.  I like the white creamy look instead of orange from cheddar.  But they all taste great! I might even try adding some ham off the bone the next time I make it. Thats what I love about this recipe.  Guaranteed to taste great no matter if you choose to go with the original recipe or make it your own!!

Thanks for the recipe!  I made it just as written except that I boiled the potatoes and microwaved the bacon.  It has a lot of flavor.

The recipe was so easy to make. Created just a little bit different to suit our taste buds. One thing the recipe does not mention is to drain the water. But if you go by the measurement, then don't drain all the water after the potatoes are cooked. We drained just a little and mixed in the soup/milk mixture.  We added cumin, garlic powder, black pepper, dried oregano and basil leaves and salt to the potatoes.  Cooked the onions in olive oil instead of bacon oil.   We also added Worcestershire sauce to our soup for excellent taste.  You can use different % milk to make your soup base thick.   Finally, garnished with fresh cilantro and cheese.  Overall, the ratings are 4.5 out of 5.

Had to substitute 1 can of soup with cream of mushroom, cooked potatoes in chicken broth, also added a little Asian hot sauce just to add a touch of spice.  Delicious stuff, easy, and of course, leftovers are even better.

I love this recipe and make it often! The only thing I do differently is boil my potatoes in half water/half chicken broth and I do not drain the potatoes. This has quickly become one of my "go to" recipes. Thanks for sharing it!

The soup was great.  Made it for my sister and me.  She couldn't stop saying "mmMmm"!  Changed the recipe a little bit: left out the bacon but cooked the onions and 2 stalks of celery in butter.  I suggest making the celery really small and cooking it well b/c it has a lot of flavor and texture.  I left out the dill weed because I didn't have any on hand.  Threw some green onion on top before serving.

this recipe was so easy and delicious. i did modify it a bit but this was a great base recipe. I added celery and sauted the celery and onion in garlic butter. I cooked the potatoes seperatley and added a couple of tsps of liquid smoke to the potatoes. i reduced the milk to about one cup and added about 2 ounces velveeta and 2 ounces pepper jack cheese. I also added butter, garlic, and liquid smoke to the soup, along with several other spices. Dont be afraid to spice this one up a bit. But the cheese definately added the right consistency.

This potato soup was very good.  This was my first attempt at any kind of soup and it turned out delicious.  It wasn't as thick as I had hoped it would be which is why I only gave 4 stars. I did add garlic and celery with the onions when you sautee. I had shredded cheddar and crumpled bacon to put on top each individual bowl.  This was good and I will make it again.

Amazingly simple and delicious!!! Had to mash potatoes a bit before adding cream of chicken/milk since hubby had tooth problem and couldn't chew very well. Cooked bacon and onions together then added potatoes and water on top w/out draining off fat (wasn't much anyways). The addition of cheddar cheese per another review absolutely gave it that extra "something" flavor. Perfect for a rainy night.

Good soup!  I made just a half amount and didn't have potatoes on hand.  I used the diced hasbrowns potato pieces which worked out great because they already have diced onion in them.  This is a very quick recipe for a cold,gray afternoon.

The only thing I did differently was to cook my potatoes first, and then cut them into cubes. Then I just added milk until it was the consistency I wanted. I'm going to make this again but use cream of garlic mushroom soup. This was so good on a chilly rainy day! Thanks, Amanda!

This was really good. Added diced celery and carrots to the onion. And also added some dried tarrogon. When you take into consideration the time and ease of making, this recipe is a keeper.

Oh I am so glad I found this recipe! I used to make this while camping or on a back pack stove when we would lose power during a snow storm.  I had a Cookbook of recipes with 6 ingredients and I believe this is the same recipe that I used.  I left the cookbook in our camper when we sold it and couldn't remember exactly how it was made. So good, So easy. I added diced celery and carrots along with the onions. Topped with celery salt, fresh dill, and the bacon. Served with a simple tomato sandwich and some fresh fruit for an easy and well balanced meal.  Thank you so much Amanda, for sharing this recipe!! It's a keeper.

This was very nice.  I advise you to use Cream of Chicken and NOT cream of mushroom.  I tried it and it's not nearly as good.  So try not to substitute if you don't have to.  I didn't add onions, I don't like them.  So I boiled the potatoes by themselves and drained them afterwards.  It considerably cut down on the amount of liquid.  It came out perfect and was eaten up lickety-split.  My family really enjoyed this.

I found this to be thin and bland.  It was better after I added cheese.  I ended up throwing out a lot of the liquid before I stored the leftovers.

Great recipe.  I used tarragon instead of dill and it was fabulous!  Didn't have much bacon on hand, so can't wait to try it again with the right amount.  I added some mixed veggies, my boyfriend loved it.  I'd like to try it without the veggie mix.  Overall, this recipe saved the day with on hand ingredients.  Thank you!

I have been waiting for fall to make this soup, and I finally made it tonight.  It was very easy and so delicious.  I made only minor changes because of what I had on hand.  Was short on milk, so I used one can of fat free carnation milk with enough added water to make 2 1/2 cups.  It was perfect.  I also added the dill to individual servings because I was not sure my dh would like it.  We both approve a lot

Very easy and very good!  I added sauteed celery with the onion.  Also, I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water and partially smashed the potatoes prior to adding the soup/milk mixture.  When serving, I sprinkled the soup with diced bacon, scallions, and a dallup of sour cream.  GREAT recipe, we all enjoyed it!

This soup was so simple to make and used basic items that I already had on hand.  It was delicious, as good as something you'd order at a fine dining establishment.  An excellent addition is shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Stir in just before serving.

We really liked this soup. I added just a little bit of flour to thicken it up some. Then I topped it with a little sourcream, bacon, and cheddar cheese to make it like a baked potato soup. Delicious.

This was much better than the potato soup I made last year. My husband and my children loved it. I added about 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese to the soup mixture while heating and sprinkled a little more on top of the bowls with some chopped green onions.

This soup has great taste and is very easy to make.  Everyone had seconds.  I added a little more dill weed than called for as well as some cheese.  Also, I mashed the potatoes a little while cooking.  This soup seems to taste even better the second day!

Very good.  I think the combination of having a little too much water and skim milk made it a tad thinner than I'd prefer, but it was very good anyway, and I may even put this in the rotation.

this is a very versatile soup! I had no bacon on hand and used chopped ham, no milk, so I used a little whipping cream in bottom of soup can and filled rest with water also used garlic salt and onion pwd. Ready in less than 30 min! Daughter loved it as well.

Excellent.  I did change it a bit though.  Since we love crab (even fake crab that's really fish but tastes just like crab) I added a 1 lb. pkg of fake crab cut up in small bits and just a bit of lemon juice.  It was yummy and excellent for lent for those that can't eat meat on Fridays!

I guess I can't review this recipe accurately because I didn't follow it, but I did intend to follow it.  As I was starting I realized I didn't have a second can of cream of chicken, and I couldn't half the recipe.  So, I substitued the second cream of chicken for a mixture of half and half, sour cream, and shredded colby jack cheese.  I also added a little skim milk for consistency.  I also added some spices to flavor  It came out absolutely fabulous.  Also, I noticed some reviewers had an excess of water in their soup after adding the potatos.  The key is to add JUST ENOUGH water to the potatos initially.  If it is done right, you shouldn't really have much liquid with your potatos by the time they are cooked, but more of jelly type coating.

Excellent tasting soup-deserves the 5 stars! I got this down to a science, where cooking time is a sweet snap.  I chop up the potatoes, enough water to cover and cook them while I'm cooking the bacon AND fresh chopped onions!  I also have standing by the open cream of chicken soup cans, milk, dill weed and a cup and so shredded cheddar cheese.  I'm convinced area ALTITUDE is the key to the watery soup concern. I'm in New Orleans area-and I didn't have to drain my potatoes. I threw in a cup and so of shredded cheddar cheese-and still had to add a dash more milk to slightly thin the soup.  Great soup idea for a cold winter's day!!

This is a good recipe to go to when you are looking for a fast and easy potato soup for a quick weeknight meal. I followed recipe exactly as written (draining potatoes of course) and it thickened up quite well as it simmered on the stove top in my favorite cast iron pot.  My hubby didn't like the dill, but I thought it was fine.  I added fresh cracked pepper and shredded cheese as a garnish prior to serving.  I will make again skipping the dill and maybe adding some garlic, corn, and sour cream to give it a boost of flavor.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was pretty good. I used the frozen diced potatoes. I just thawed them and skipped the boiling step. I also added 2 cups of sharp cheddar to give it some volume to the flavors. If I could do it over, I'd do a little less onion, and I think sour cream would be a good addition. Serve with toast (I always have butter on my toast!) or crackers.

I made it 4 stars because its a great base soup.  I used twice the amount of potatoes, I only had one can of Cream of Chicken soup so I only added one and one Chicken broth.  I didnt have any dill weed but I had fresh parsley and fresh basle, so I added that.  I also added 2 green onions cut up.  And at the end I added 1 cup of cheddar and 1lb of ground beef.  Tasted wonderful!  So I give my changes a 5!  :-)  Thanks!  Oh I forgot.. I added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the onion bacon fat mix.

Mmmm!  I did make a couple of changes.  7 cups cubed potatoes, a whole package of bacon (Cooked & Crumbled), RED onion (preference)& celery - cooked in the bacon grease (which I also poured into the soup), added one can of Cream Of Mushroom, lowered milk to 1.5 cups and added a 16 oz container of sour cream.  Put Parmesan cheese in the soup, as it cooked (enough to give it a slight taste) and one cube chicken bouillon.  Spices:  Garlic, Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle, Chives, Penzey's Black & Red, a shake of nutmeg (for depth), and just a shake of the dill (not nearly a tsp).  **Did have to thicken up with a bit of cornstarch**

I personally thought this was very good.  I made it for a sick relative but probably should have made something a little less heavy for her.  Took the left overs home and my husband loved it.  He's asking when I'm going to make it for him.

Great recipe for us with just a minor change.  Used one can cream of celery and a little more milk.  The cream of chicken just didn't sound good to me.  Didn't use the dill weed either.  Delicious warmed over for lunch the next day!  Enjoy!

This recipe was really good.  It was super super easy! We added a little bit of parmesan cheese at the end, with the bacon.  (And we used canadian bacon for a healthier option) I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's the best potato soup I've ever made!

This is a pretty good base recipe but you definately need to add a little to it for flavor.  I evenly divided the milk with half and half, used one cup water and one can of chicken broth (instead of all water to cover the potatos), instead of two cans of cream of chicken soup I used one cream of chicken and one cream of celery, added allot of pepper and salt, and added about 3 tablespoons of salted butter and I mixed the crumbled bacon throughout.  Now I'm relaxing on my couch enjoying a nice bowl of hot soup with oyster crackers (OK, so my sodium and fat intake is going thru the roof but it is yummy on a cool fall day!!).

This was very bland but can be spiced up or additions made, easily.  Good "basic" potato soup but needs alot of work to become topnotch.  Will keep looking for the "ultimate" potato soup.

Good taste but could have been thicker and just seemed like it was missing something.

I made this soup tonight and impressed myself with how well it turned out.  Potato soup is one of my favorite foods and this soup was wonderful.  Instead of the dill weed, I used celery seed, which really adds a unique flavor.  (My grandmother always used this in her potato soup.)  Also, I only used one can of cream of chicken soup and used cream of broccoli for the 2nd can.  For some more texture, I used some prepared biscuit dough to make easy dumplings.  You just drop pieces of the dough into the water with the potatoes while they are boiling.  I will DEFINETELY make this soup again.

Sooooo good! I did change a couple things; I excluded the dill and bacon, and used Lowrys and Garlic Salt for seasonings. Served with shredded cheese, bacon bits, and sour cream. Awesome, just perfect for the first cold day of the year here in TX! My 2 year old loved it.

This soup is AWESOME!  It was exactly what I hoped it would be.  I left the dill out and added parsley instead.  Next time I will cook the entire package of bacon, as my husband and I had to fight over what was there.  I told everyone about it!

More people asked for this recipe than any other recipe that I've tried. It was delicious!  I only made one change...instead of milk, I used one small carton of heavy whipping cream. Thank you for sharing this one!

Great Recipe.  My husband (who tried to discourage me from making it by saying "just by the canned soup") fell in love with it, and now puts special requests in for it.  I personally used a can of chicken broth (in replacement for some of the water) to boil the potatoes in, along with a little lawrys seasoning salt.  It was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very easy, but it needed a bit more taste.  I made extra bacon and crumbled it in the soup and I added chopped green onions on top!  Made a huge difference.

I drains most of the water out of the potatoes after cooking them just to give a little more starch flavoring. but I used cream of chicken and herbs. Somehow it came out to be smoky but it was good. Between two people, it was gone in a day! going to fix it again soon!

Hold back some of the cooking water and add it back a little at a time after the soup is cooked.   That way you will get the consistency you want. I think the secret to any good potato soup is to add cream of chicken soup.  It doesn't always need cheese that way.

I made this when my daughter (suffering with mouth sores from chemo) asked for something soft and yummy to eat. I made it quickly and easily after getting home from work late. I added about 1/2 cup of mild cheddar to thicken a bit more. She enjoyed it very much and was very grateful to get it. Thanks for a quick, easy, and great tasting recipe.

This was very good for how simple and quick it was to make. I had all the ingredients on hand, except for fresh potatoes. I subbed frozen diced potatoes and added much more seasonings including black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I would make it again! Didn't have any leftovers. I'll add shredded carrots next time to get more veggies in

made it with 1 and a half cups of milk. Added one celery stick chopped, a quarter teaspoon of chopped garlic. tastes great. still less creamy than I thought. will try cream cheese next time. instead of bacon, I used half a package of breakfast sausage chopped.

This is awesome for in-between paydays for sure. I didn't have bacon(but I did have leftover bacon fat from last night's dinner. Seriously, it makes all the difference for the onions!!!) but I strained out all the water before adding the soup/milk mix and added shredded cheese at the end. Super good, thanks for posting this recipe

Good recipe with a lot of wiggle room for streamlining  to your own preferences.  I have made this three times now. Twice as written and this last time I added cheddar cheese. You really can't  go wrong with this recipe.

This turned out great .  I  put 1 cup of heavy cream and 1-1/2 cup of milk to the cream of chicken and mixed it good with my kitchen aid  then added to potatoes . I also added a little garlic and topped it off with a little cheese .  Remember if you cooked the potato with 2 much water you will need to drain some , but not all ...thanks for the recipe .

I did change it up just a bit. I used 1 can of chicken broth and added just enough water to cover the potatoes to cook them. Most of the liquid cooks off during cook time. I didn't put the onions in. Then I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup with 2 cans of milk. Salt and pepper to taste. Cook it up and eat it up! Oh, green onions and bacon crumbles on top. Yum!

This has become one of my go to recipes. Husband and all his buddies love it. I use red potatoes and red onion, as the red potatoes have a naturally more buttery flavor and smoother texture, and the red skins and red onion add extra pops of color. Also, I use half and half instead of milk for extra creamy texture. If my soup is to thick, I use reduced sodium chicken broth to help thin it a bit.  Some helpful tips: make sure you cook your potatoes until ALMOST done. If you cook them fully, they will likely become over done when you add them to the soup and will fall apart.  Also, don't forget to season the potatoes before adding them.  The only other thing I do differently, is I add the Dill to taste.

I have tried this recipe  Quick Creamy Potato Soup, and loved it. However this is what I had to do when i was hit with a drastic change in diet. I take either fresh or frozen cauliflower and boil it. I add a potato or two. When it is cooked I use my paddle and puree it. I add savory as a seasoning but you can use anything. I also added northern beans. No sodium. Now I use this for all creamed soups. This recipe was my inspiration to find foods that I can eat. Thank you.

Tried this tonight. I left out the onions and used oscar meyer bacon pieces. Pretty much cooked the potatoes, added the condensed soup mixed with a lil water to make it smoother. I didn't drain my potatoes, just added the soup mix & sum shredded cheddar that. Let it a all warm together for about 5 min. Then we added bacon pieces & more shredded cheese. yyuuuumm. even my 4 yr old loved it & he won't usually eat soup.

Really like this recipe. Changes I made were to salt the water I cooked the potatoes in and then to completely drain off the water. I added the soups and added 1 and 1/2 can of milk instead of 2 and 1/2 cups to make a thicker soup. Next time I will make 1 can of the soup low sodium, but the potatoes really need to boil in the salted water, unless you make the soup the day before and serve it the next day or the potatoes will have no flavor. I made it with and without bacon and liked it both ways. Next time I will add a cup of chopped ham to try it out that way.

This recipe is awesome. I've never made potato soup before but this recipe was easy to follow and the flavor was incredible. The only thing I added was some minced garlic and celery when sauteing the onion. Thanks for the post. I will be making frequently.

Very good soup.  I followed the recipe but did not use the dill weed.  I also followed another suggestion and used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of brocolli & cheese soup.  Soup was hearty and filling.  I don't think it will ever take the place of my traditional potato soup, but it was a nice change. I will definitly make again.

This is super easy and super tasty!! I have added some cheddar cheese and green onions at the end. I also switched to using creamy chicken herb condensed soup. I like this flavor more than the plain chicken soup. It's also easy to make more or less if you want, it's all to your taste and you can't mess it up..I like that ;)

This is a great, creamy soup.  I subsitutes parsley for dill, which was good.  Also I accidentally overcooked the potatoes until they started falling apart- which turned out to make it even better!

Easy and tasty. Wonderful combination of flavors. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added some celery and some shredded cheddar cheese. I also used green onion in place of 1/2 of the onion. Some additional seasonings also thrown in: a little bit of rosemary, some celery salt, and garlic salt. This soup thickens nicely as some of the potatoes dissolve when cooking...very nice texture. Perfect "cold weather food."  I garnished with chives.

I did not have bacon (and wanted to save the fat by not putting bacon in anyway) so I omitted it completely, added celery and carrots, lots of pepper, garlic salt and seasoning salt.  Also added 1/2 cup so of shredded cheese and let it melt in.  it was a bit runnier than I expected, so I thickened it up a bit with corn starch.  Great base soup for anyones taste, just add what you like, take out what you don't!

This was simple to make and we enjoyed it Very Much!  For the leftovers I combined the bacon crumbles on top and then when I re-heated the leftovers stirred them in, it was good that was as well!  (I used 1can celery/1can chicken)

Very good recipe, and quick to prepare, as promised. As per other reviewers, I added celery and carrot to the onions. I added salt, pepper, dill and celery seed to the sauteeing vegetables, and adjusted seasoning again after adding the soup and milk. I also stirred in some sharp cheddar cheese. It was very flavorful, even using Cream of Mushroom soup, but as I mentioned I did add plenty of spices and herbs. Served with shredded sharp cheddar, a dollop of plain yogurt and some green onions. My husband had seconds, even though he was full. It was that good.

I think the fault is mostly mine, the bacon got squishy cuz I added it to the whole pot, then warmed up leftovers..Also I found it very blah, even though I added spices. I'm going to try once more, after all potatos are pretty cheap.

Loved this.  Added a bit of celery salt to the potatoes when they were cooking and left out the dill weed since my husband doesn't like it.  Will definately make again.

5 stars, made a few changes.  Substituted green onion instead of white, thyme instead of dill.  Skipped bacon to make it healthier.  Chicken broth instead of cream soup.   Still a very very delicious, easy soup.  A keeper for our family!

I love this recipe! Following the advice of some others I only added enough liquid to cook the potatos thoroughly, and then added only 2 cups of milk to the cream of chicken soup. The flavor was wonderful and the thickness was perfect. Thanks for this keeper!

Very good, but next time I will cut back on the water.  I like potato soup more on the thicker side.  We had a ton left over, and it was even better the next night.

This soup was amazing!  I followed the directions in every way, and it came out perfect.  I did brown everything, and then threw it all together in the crock pot and let it cook on low all day!  I will definitely make again!  And for what it's worth, my husband wasn't to fond of potato soup, until he had this recipe!

This was great, but with all the 5-stars, I expected better.  By the time it was all gone, I was tired of it.  I'll make it again this winter though when we have company to help us eat it all.

I made this soup a few weeks for myself and my husband. We both really liked it. Like others, I added some cubed ham which I warmed up with the onions. I also left out the dill because I dont care for it. All in all it was a great recipe and we plan on makeing it again!

My husband and I were looking for something quick, easy and tasty for a late lunch. We were both stumped for ideas when we came upon this recipe. Mmm! I added some celery in addition to the other veggies, and my hubby requested a few extra pieces of bacon. We loved it. Will make again. Thanks!

i went through as added many things others  
suggested...

carrots, ham, garlic powder, lawrys seasoning salt, i also added cubed cheese and shredded cheese...which makes the soup much more intense.
i have made it twice, and twice it has been gone in three days.

I made this just as directed and it was wonderful!  I never had any luck previously with potato soup but this came out perfect. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe! This soup was thick and hearty and served as our  whole meal. I used left over kilbasa in place of bacon(I was out of bacon) and it came out great! This will be a favorite in our meal planning future.
