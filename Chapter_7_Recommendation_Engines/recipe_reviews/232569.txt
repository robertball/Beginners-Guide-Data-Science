I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, and a bit more cinnamon. I took this cheesecake to my job and it was devoured in short order. I have since received several requests to bring in another one! Great recipe!! I am making this again for Christmas.

This is such a great dessert. It's as easy to make as it is delicious. I made the crust and filling in the food processor, next time I'll put in the slicing disc to cut the apples instead of hand-chopping them. I changed the spice a bit, my husband doesn't like too much cinnamon so I used only a tablespoon and some freshly grated nutmeg.  

I made this for Easter as the dessert to go with a pork rib dinner--everyone loved it. My husband said it's a 'Make Again' and make it again I will.  This would be nice to take to any party or get together. Yum. Yum. Yum.

We followed the recipe to the t and I can tell something was off. Did not come out like a apple cheesecake pie. It actually came out more like a cobbler. I believe the measurement for the whole 1 Tablespoon is wrong in the cream cheese mix. Would not recommend.

This yummy dessert will please both the pie lover and the cheesecake lover.  I made apple roses just to jazz it up a bit.  I simply microwaved the apple slices for 60 seconds, laid out several in a row, sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar, and rolled them up.  It was time consuming making the roses, but sprinkled with a little powdered sugar, I loved the result.

I followed the receipt exactly, except discovered the sugar for the cream cheese sitting on my counter after I'd put the pie in the oven and it was still delicious . I drizzled caramel over the top.

Great pie. Not quite a cheesecake. Not quite an apple pie. But very delicious!

OMG, so good! Everybody loved it. I used a store bought graham crust and used 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese (12 oz.) but otherwise followed the recipe. I baked it @350 for 25 minutes. Came out perfect. I will definitely be making this again!!

First thing's first: I altered this recipe. 

I didn't use regular, all-purpose flour, because I didn't have it on-hand. Instead, I used whole wheat flour. Since it's more dense, I figured I'd use less for the crust. I ended up using nearly 4 cups before I got a workable dough. The dough itself doesn't really seem like a dough at all- just butter and flour. 

I didn't have a pie tin either- I used a jumbo-cupcake tin and made six small cheesecakes instead. It worked out fine. For the topping, I used Michigan apples and only 1 tablespoon of cinnamon (I love cinnamon, just misread the recipe). I ended up having so many apple slices left over, I could have made another six cheesecakes. I would recommend getting an apple slicer or having a buddy to help you slice the apples, that process took me about an hour in itself (I also did everything by hand- coring, slicing, etc., and I made the slices super thin). I didn't peel the apples but I partially wish I did, for aesthetic purposes/I'm not a fan of the skin. If I were to make this again, I'd also make a streusel and really make it more like an apple pie.

Next time, I'm definitely looking for regular flour. The crust came out bland and tough. Also, perhaps longer cooking time or more time to cool (I rushed and dug into it before it was completely cool), as it fell apart completely and the filling didn't seem entirely done. Otherwise, it was delicious. I'm definitely making it again- I have to, I have so many apples left over!

A good combo for when you can't decide on an apple pie or a cheesecake. 

I think the amount of cinnamon is way too much for the recipe though; I've never come across an apple pie that calls for 1 tablespoon of cinnamon before. I'd make this again with 1/2 that amount next time.

The crust really sets this pie off. Loved by all!
