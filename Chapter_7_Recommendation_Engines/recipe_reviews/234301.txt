Quick and tasty! No sugar needed, especially if you're using a very ripe cantaloupe. I used non-fat milk, but this would be good with almond, soy or cashew milk too. This recipe made 24oz of "juice". Yum!

This was really good-once I added a few changes! It needs more than just a little bit of sugar, so one or two extra tablespoons of honey or agave bring out the sweetness of the cantaloupe.
