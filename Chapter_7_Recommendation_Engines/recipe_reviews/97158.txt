THESE BURGERS ARE FLAVORFUL, MOIST AND LOOK GREAT TOO.  I ADDED RED AND YELLOW PEPPERS AND THE COLOR IS GREAT TOO.

These were pretty good but not great. The flavor just seemed to lack something. I added more spices and it still wasn't enough. Not sure what would give these the kick I was hoping for, but the recipe as is falls a little short.

Good burgers, but a tablespoon of bread crumbs didn't hold my turkey meat together so I had to use quite a bit more.

These were just ok, I used italian bread crumbs instead of plain thinking they would add more flavor but the burgers still needed more. If I made again I think I would add some redwine vinegar and parmesan cheese. But I like the turkey burger recipe with spinach and feta much better so will probably stick to that.
