This was a big hit with my friends!  One woman, who eats this particular kind of salad a lot said it was the best she'd ever had.  Great recipe!

Great Broccoli recipe!  Since I'm not a mayonnaise fan I only used about 1/3 of a cup,cut the pieces very small to help absorb the flavor, and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  I will definitely make this again.

I've tried other versions of this with white wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar and thought the cider vinegar in this was a little strong.  It was alot of dressing for the amount of broccoli -- I'd half it next time.

I used to make a version of this 2x a week where I worked. Instead of peanuts, used sunflower seeds, golden raisins, red onion, & some bacon. The dressing was the same. Cider vinegar really makes a difference. There was also another version with broccoli, red onion, bacon, chunks of cheddar cheese, & a Vidalia onion dressing, for non-mayo people like myself...great base recipe!

So yummy! I've made it with once with Veganase (vegan mayonase) and with mayonase, and I must say I prefered the Veganase. Also, half dried canberries and half raisens is tasty.

Fabulous and really, really easy to make. I used white vinegar because I didn't have cider vinegar, and I added shredded carrots. I also chilled it overnight and periodically stirred it. Will definitely make again.

My whole family loved this - even my 2 teenage girls!  I didn't have an entire cup of peanuts (unsalted) so added some sunflower seeds and cashews.  So easy too!  This will definitely be a regular on our menu!

I love this recipe & make it frequently except that I prefer cashews rather than peanuts and use low-fat mayonnaise and Splenda in place of full-fat mayonnaise and sugar.

I give this five stars. I dislike when people review a recipe and do a zillion modifications, but . . . we have a horrible sweet-tooth in this house, so I had to add more sugar (blushes). I blame us, not the recipe. I like how you can eyeball this too. I had two broccoli heads and didn't want to waste them, so after assembling the recipe as written (perfect!) I tossed the extra in. No problem. My 11 year old son liked this so much, he had some for "dessert" later in the evening!! Thanks for sharing.

With modifications, this has become my picky husband's favorite vegetable!  For starters, this needs more sugar if using a cup of mayo (like about 1/2 cup of sugar).  Secondly, I use (re-hydrated) dried cranberries instead of raisins (just makes it more colorful & the sweetness of the cransins completes the tangy, sweet dressing!)  I also add 1/2 onion, chopped fine & 8oz. grated mozzarella. Oh! and you've GOT to add 8-10 strips of bacon, cooked crisp & crumbled!  That REALLY makes it!

This is very tasty, my sister made it for our father's day celebration. It's just as good the next day. Since she used veganaise instead of mayo, we had a vegan version and no one even knew the difference!

This didn't go over very well for me. The apple cider vinegar was just too overwhelming. I didn't have peanuts, so I toasted sunflower seeds & slivered almonds. I used a sweet red onion and less sugar. As is, I didn't care for it, so I cooked up some bacon & added a bit of fresh lemon juice. I'll use a different vinegar next time. To me this was all sweet with no sour.

I've made a salad very simular to this one before.  However, for me if I steam the broccoli a little it seems to enhance the flavor.  Broccoli is so good for us, that it is wonderful to have many variations.

I make this with bagged broccoli slaw instead of florets, toasted blanched almonds and golden raisins.  Terrific!

I'm giving this 3 stars because it was very easy and everyone I served seemed to think it was okay.  My dad thought it was bland.  Though I like all the ingredients, I thought the blend of the flavors was awful.  I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  Won't be making it ever again.

I did not care for the flavor of this salad--too sour, I think.  It seemed like a LOT of dressing for the amount of broccoli.  I would probably do less mayo and more sugar next time.

I thought this was really good, which surprised me because I'm not usually a big fan of mayo-based dressings (I only tried this in the first place because I had a ton of peanuts and raisins to use up).  The mix of tangy and sweet in this dish is just right. My one suggestion is that there is no way only 4 cups of florets makes eight servings, even if you're eating very, very small side dish servings.  As written, I think this probably yields four servings.  Also, I ended up using the full four cups of broccoli but only half the amount of everything else called for and the proportions seemed right.  I think there would have been way too much mayo otherwise. I was skeptical, but this turned out really good!

Really liked this recipe.  Made a few modifications, I used craisins and sunflower seeds in place of the raisins and peanuts and added some reduced fat shredded cheese.  Used 1/3 c reduced fat mayonnaise.  I thought there were a lot of craisins and sunflower seeds in comparison to the amount of broccoli so I think next time I will double the amount of broccoli and used the full amount of mayo.  Overall, very good recipe and I will make again!

Not only does this salad taste great but it looks pretty.  I'm not a huge raisin fan so I usually leave those out.  I do add a diced red onion, halved red grapes and bacon bits.  Instead of peanuts try cashews.  So good!
