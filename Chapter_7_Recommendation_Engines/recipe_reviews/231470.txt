We thought this tasted outstanding!  I should give this fewer stars because of the fact that I think the flour:cream ratio is off.  When I put the flour into the cream, it immediately made a very thick paste.  I think maybe there is a typo in the amount of flour, and I would start with half a teaspoon and work up.  I didn't want my rating to deter anyone from trying this!  I put this with Easy Crispy Baked Chicken from this site, and we had a marvelous dinner!  Thank you!

I made this the other night and it was a hit! I didn't have lobster mushrooms, so I used portabella and shiitake. I also didn't have heavy whipping cream, so I used 2 cups of milk and 3/4 cup half & half with about 4 tablespoons of flour to make up for the liquid. I wanted more of a sauce and when I only added the 3/4 cup of half & half it was totally not a sauce. Which is why I added the 2 cups milk. Anyways. It was delicious and I loved it!! Will be making this again!

Flavors were great. My version created as a sauce for cheese ravioli, was one box of mushrooms, sliced, with 1-1/2 cups of half and half  and 6 t. flour, 3 T Parmesan, and 3 T butter as the base, cooking the mushrooms in the butter before adding all ingredients.  This provided enough for three generous servings of sauce over ravioli.  I also added a tough of a mix of fresh-ground sea salt and garlic.

Really good! But agree that the cream:flour ratio is off. I used a cup of cream and 2T of flour. Also, I added blanched broccolini to the sauce and served over spinach penne. Will definitely make again.

I made this to pour over some chicken cordon blue that I had made, and it was a big hit. I only had button mushrooms, so those had to do, but the flavor was still amazing. This will definitely become a regular for us.

I've made this twice. The first time, exactly as written. The taste (with shiitake - lobster mushrooms are difficult to find) was very good, but a few tweaks the second time made it better. After cooking the mushrooms, I added the shallot and stirred over the heat for two minutes. Then, I added the flour and stirred again over the heat for another two minutes. This was to help the raw taste of the flour to become more rounded in the finished sauce. I added 2 Tb of beef stock (chicken would be all right, too, and will give a lighter flavor) to the heavy cream, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe as written. These measures only added a few minutes to prep time, but deepened the flavor to an intriguing complexity that remarkably complemented the steak over which it was served. It drew rave reviews .

I used only 1 T of flour, stirred into the sauteed leeks and mushrooms for 2 minutes, then added 1/2&1/2 and stirred until it thickened. I omitted the cheese altogether and then I tasted to correct the salt and pepper. We served on  toasted French bread for lunch. Yum!!!

had this over a pork tenderloin. Made this as written but used half and half in place of cream. It was still very rich and for us real cream would have been too much. I had no problem getting the sauce to thicken and might replace some of the cream with chicken broth next time since it is so rich as written.

Tasted great- of course there were changes but essentially the same- I also thought  the flour to cream ratio made a too thick sauce- but that’s partly because I had more mushrooms than called for- so I added chicken broth til it was the consistency I wanted for my pasta. I cooked the shrooms in a stainless steel pan so it was different than a Teflon- i threw a few tablespoons of sherry wine in to get the browned bits off the bottom of the pan-and took it off the heat before adding the cream.  I had also cooked one leek in with the mushrooms instead of the shallot.  Gave it a similar flavor I’m sure. I never used heavy cream cooking before but I think this may become habit- very creamy and tasty!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it's quick and the simpleness of the sauce really highlights the flavor of the mushrooms. I read other reviews and made changes based on what I had on hand; did not have shallots (or an onion, oops!) so I sautéed the mushrooms with 1 t of garlic in olive oil before adding the other ingredients. I used half and half and 1/3 c did not seem like enough sauce so I added about 1/4 c more. I used 1/2 t of arrowroot instead of flour and the sauce was still incredibly thick by the time I added the cheese (I used 3 T of parmesan). I tossed it with some pasta and it turned out great!

I think the flour ratio was off too. Next time, use heavy cream and no flour at all.

It is always a fabulous sauce! We love it on pork roast!  I use half and half because I usually have that in stock. I also buy the gourmet blend of mushrooms at my grocer. Very easy way to ramp up your meal!

This is a delicious cream sauce. I only had canned mushrooms, so I used them, sauteed in a bit of butter, and it was fine. 
Like others, I found the quantities way off. For that much flour, you need at least a cup of liquid. I doubled everything, and used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. The final result had a great consistency and was very good over pasta.

This recipe was delicious! However, I did make some changes. I did add the cream, flour, and cheese according to how thick I wanted it. My family really liked it and I will be making it again!

This was awesome!  I did not use the milk/flour combination, I used a tub of Creme Fraiche with the heavy cream since I had it on hand.  Had it over grilled pork chops, but this could easily work with chicken as well.

I made this to go with a bunch of veggies and meats I had left over from a fondue party.  It was delicious!!  I have never even heard of lobster mushrooms, so ended up using button.  I had to add a splash of cream because the sauce was REALLY thick.  Tasted great though!
