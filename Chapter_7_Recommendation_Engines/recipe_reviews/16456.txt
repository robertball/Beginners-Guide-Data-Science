This sounded great and everyone seemed to love it by the reviews so maybe I only thought I followed the recipe to a "T".  It overflowed my 1 1/2lb bread machine pan and ruined the maker entirely with burning all over the interior so the machine is now in the trash and I have to buy a new one.  Be aware while trying the recipe

I made fabulous sticky buns out of this dough.  Put in bread machine on dough cycle.  Roll out into a rectangle, spread with filling: 1/2c soft butter, 1/4c flour, 3/4c brown sugar, 1T cinnamon mixed together.  Roll-up and cut into 1" slices.  Spray 2 pans (9x13 each) with Pam.  Spread caramel topping in pans:  1c melted butter, 1+1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c corn syrup.  Sprinkle chopped macadamia nuts and coconut over topping.  Put rolls in pans, cover and let rise until double (30 - 40 min).  Bake at 350 for 30 to 35 min.  Let cool in pans 5 min, turn over onto a platter or cookie sheet covered with parchment and let caramel run over rolls before removing the pan.  Seriously decadent...people are begging for more.

Great tasting bread, Teresa. Some of the reviewers suggested that it tasted like Kings Hawaiian Bread. Never having tasted that, I can only imagine....but I will tell you it was wonderful with full flavor and very good texture. I let my bread machine go thru the dough cycle, then I took the dough out and formed the loaf, baking it in a 9x5 loaf pan at 375 degrees for 33 minutes. PERFECT. It makes aromatic toast, too. Yummy. My hubby didn't enjoy it as much as I, he said it tasted too much like banana, well DUH! Maybe I'll cut the bananas to 1/4 cup for his sake next time.

Absolutely Fabulous.  The flavor is just like "Kings Hawaiian Bread" that is purchsed in the grocery store.  The only difference is that the crust is not as soft.  The first time I made it I didn't measure "exactly" and it did not raise nor brown.  The second time I followed the instructions to the "T" and it turned out perfect.  You will love this bread.....It will take you all of 5 minutes to throw all the ingredients together.

Excellent!  So easy and moist.  This was the first recipe i made in my new bread machine i got for christmas.  I had no coconut extract so i just used vanilla, and i didnt have any potoato flakes so i just used 1/3 more cup of flour and 1/4 cup more milk and it still turned out great!

My 10 year old daughter and her friends love this bread with coconut flavor.  But my husband is not so crazy about coconut flavor so I made it with vanilla extract instead of coconut and he loved it!  I make the dough in my bread machine and take it out and bake it in the oven for about 35-40 minutes.  It comes out nicer and slice better.
Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I did mine in the oven with a few modifications.  

OVEN MODIFICATION:

I doubled the recipe:

In a mixer, I combined 1 banana, 1/2 c. pineapple, and coconut milk until it made 2 cups of the blended mix.  I added the ingredients one by one in a separate bowl whisking slowly(doubling the ingredients) until everything but the yeast and flour was combined.  I proofed the yeast with a couple of tbsp of water and added to the wet mix.  After mixing that in, I added flour slowly stirring... then kneading after 4 cups.  I got up to 5 1/2 cups flour for the double recipe.  At that point, I put the dough into a lightly greased bowl and put in the oven on about 100 degrees to rise.  I waited for about 1.5 hr, then formed the dough into 3 loaves and put into the 100 degree oven again to rise for another 1.5 hr. After that, I removed the 3 bread pans from the oven, preheated to 350, and baked for about 40 minutes.  VERY VERY GOOD!

This bread is wonderful.  Tastes great and has a fine texture.  I used the sweet bread setting on my bread machine, and the loaf was high and perfectly light brown.  Great with homemade strawberry freezer jam!

This the exact recipe I was looking for!  I did have to add an extra 1/4c of milk, as it was very dry.  But it turned out moist, thick and is a favorite!  I even didn't add the coconut extract and it still tasted like I thought it would.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is my favorite bread machine recipe. It's moist and very flavorful, while not being overwhelmingly coconutty.  I love it sliced thick, toasted, and buttered.  Thanks, Teresa, for a great recipe!

Excellent bread! The only thing that I had to do was add a little water during the neading cycle.  Also used baby food bananna's stage 2 which gave a milder bananna flavor.  My breadmaker is a horizontal loaf and additional moisture is needed.  The whole family loved this bread.

Very moist, rich bread. Substituted Coconut cream for milk and extract and used the sweet bread setting on bread machine. More complex than some recipes but this is a keeper.

Got a new bread machine for Christmas and just had to try it out! We don't have King's Hawaiian bread in our local stores & I have missed it since moving here. This recipe is very close to it. Easy, delicious and the house smelled wonderful while it was baking. This recipe is a real keeper!

Good flavor but became super dry and crumbly, to the point of it becoming bread crumbs when you sliced it within a day.

**Make sure you have a 2 lb. bread machine. Mine was overflowing and the bread turned out raw. After putting the bread in the oven, the taste was very good. I used it with spinach dip. I'm sure it would've been better if I didn't have to stop the cooking. I will try it again either smaller or bake it in the oven.

with vanilla.  Dad liked the vanilla, I liked the almond.  Great recipe!

I decreased the amount of cocunut extract to 1/4 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  It was a huge hit this way.  The full teaspoon of cocunut was a bit over powering in the original recipe for me.  It is a great bread though!

Fabulous! I'm hugely addicted I also had an overflow problem w/ my 1.5 lb machine (got nervous and took the loaf out about 15 minutes before the machine was done baking it, because it was mashed up against the lid, then I finished it off in the conventional oven).  It was delicious, albeit oddly shaped.  On subsequent attempts, I just used my bread machine to make the dough, as people suggested, then baked it in 9x4 loaf pans for about 30+ minutes in the oven.  Once I tried part of the dough in a 9x4 loaf, then the rest of the dough as rolls (just baked rounded globs of dough), but I prefer the bread in loaves--it's a little less dense.     Delicious plain, toasted, with a bit of butter, as french toast...will be trying it in a bread pudding, too!

This bread is wonderful - tastes just like the Hawaiian Bread I used to buy.  I prepare it quite a bit - it stays fresh for 5 days.  I love preparing it in my bread machine.

This bread is wonderful. I had to make a few changes, as we have some food allergies to eggs in our family. None the less it is a wonderful, moist, sweet, bread.

WOW!! I love this bread! It has wonderful flavor, more like a dessert bread. I call it 'Pina Colada Bread.' :) I make it exactly as the recipe states. It turns out very soft, an excellent loaf. I make bread every day, and I think this is by far my favorite. (My favorite dinner bread is the Steakhouse Bread recipe on this site.) My only suggestion, depending on your bread maker, make sure you set to 1 1/2 lb. loaf and if you have a sweet bread setting use it with a light crust. I really don't understand any of the more negative reviews. This bread is outstanding!

made this bread twice, first time had wonderful flavor, but did not rise correctly, 2nd try, I proofed the yeast in the milk, with a pinch of sugar, and added to the rest of ingredients, and I can actually say I am sitting here writing this review, loving life with a light fluffy wonderful flavored thick hunk of bread, wow I think I found what I was looking for. five stars

Great even though I didn't have a bread machine. I substituted whole wheat bread flour (and subtracted 3 Tablespoons of the flour and added 3 Tablespoons vital wheat gluten instead) and it still turned out a very tender crumb. I did let it raise twice because I didn't use fast acting yeast but I bet you can get away with one raising if you did.

This bread is so sweet and tasty!  My kids just love it.  It almost tastes better after a few hours for the flavors to cool off and to settle in.  I used this in conjunction with another recipe from here, "Chicago Dip".  It's a spinich dip and you dip chunks of this bread into it.  I just cut up the bread into big size chunk-squares and served it with this dip.  It was a big hit at a baby shower last night.  The only thing I did different was use vanilla instead of cocunut because I didn't have cocunut.  Enjoy! Priscilla P

Excellent!  I followed the directions exactly and measured carefully with the exception of substituting 4 oz jar of baby food bananas for the 1/2 cup of bananas.  It was a perfect and lovely, high rounded loaf.  Thanks for the recipe!  : )

This recipe is awesome! My thirty-something son took one bite and said it was the best bread he had ever tasted in his life. I mixed the dough in the dough cycle of my bread maker (2 hours), punched it down & divided the dough between two greased 8" round cake pans. After rising for about an hour, I baked it at 375o for 25 min. The texture was perfect, light and spongy, and my family liked the coconut flavor.

Turned out GREAT! It made my kitchen smell like a bakery. I liked the way it turned out so much that I made a loaf for my neighbor. I didn't have Coconut extract so I used vanilla instead, turned out fine. Will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

This bread was really good.  I actually made sandwiches with it.  If you take a piece of bread, spread it with some diijon mustard, put on some lettuce, swiss cheese and deli ham, then another piece of bread, it makes a great Hawaiian style sandwich.  Serve it with some plain potato chips and milk and you've got a great meal for a warm night!  Thanks for the wonderful, splendiforous recipe!

I made this w/ vanilla instead of coconut flav and w/coconut flav. I also made it in bread machine and another time just made the dough in the bread machine. My favorite version is using the ingredients as stated in recipe, increase to make 2 lb loaf. Make dough in bread machine and then bake in 2 stoneware 
bread pans, 350 for about 25 min. Then make a glaze to go on top using powdered sugar pineapple juice from the pineapple and coconut flavoring. put glaze on top of loaf while it is still warm and serve warm. It was delicious and everyone at the party I took it to wanted the recipe.

Wonderful!  Followed other reviews and used vanilla extract.  I set my bread machine at 2 lb sweet bread light setting and it came out perfect!  No overflowing as mentioned and baked all the way through.  This recipe will make a regular rotation on our table.  Thank you for sharing.

My man LOVES this bread and cries for it all the time. I have to use vanilla instead of coconut extract because for some reason he doesn't like coconut. I add a little more milk than what is called for so it comes out softer and is almost doughy around the edges...that's how we roll in our house!  This is a great sweet bread recipe that is super easy but makes me look like a #1 baker. Thanks so much for posting this Teresa!

This is, by far, my favorite bread recipe EVER. I have made so many loaves and they come out PERFECT every time. The pineapple is what really makes this bread. I keep meaning to save some to make french toast... but it's usually gone the very next day!! Yum yum!!

Personally, I didn't like this at all. I thought I did something wrong, but my roommates both loved it! Turns out I don't like banana in bread, but they do. So if you love banana, you'll probably like this. Meanwhile, I'm going to look for a hawaiian bread that doesn't have banana.

Wonderful, flavorful, and delicious.  I would make this over and over.  I used my bread machine to mix the dough, putting in the wet ingredients first and then the dry, with the yeast and sugar on top.  Watch it though - the last rising would have overflowed, so I recommend taking it out for the last rise and putting it on a pan to bake in the oven.  Split the dough in half and make two round loaves - one loaf is massive, and hard to cook thoroughly.  I only made one loaf and it was slightly underbaked, despite the crust being golden brown.  I subbed vanilla for the coconut extract.

This is amazing!  I dont understand the reviews that said it didnt work - it comes out fabulous each time for me.  Everytime I bring bread to a function, its this one that is requested.  Its best if you let your bananas get a little mushy - i put them in the microwave if they are still ripe to soften them up a tad.

I made this for a Hawaiian theme birthday party for my 13 year old and it was a hit! I do not have a bread machine, so I kneaded it  and let it rise for an hour and a half. I was a bit worried when the dough did not rise as much as I had expected, but pressed on anyway. I formed the dough into rolls and let rise a second time--the end result was a soft, sweet roll that tasted great alone or with butter. The guests tore into the rolls and didn't leave ANY left! By the way, I didn't have coconut extract and vanilla was a perfect substitute. I will make this again.

Smells great, tastes great.  It didn't rise as much as other people suggested.  My bread machine doesn't have a sweet bread setting, so I used white bread.  was that the difference?  I'm open for suggestions.

I made this on a whim for Thanksgiving dinner with my family, just for a change of pace. I followed the substitutions of vanilla for coconut extract, and the flour/milk for the potato flakes (which is coincidentally the comment posted in the cookbook, which I have, but didn't use this time). It was a surprise hit with everyone! I used the bread machine through the dough stage, then put it in a loaf pan in the oven at 350 until it was lightly browned. I'd like to try it with the potato flakes - my dough was really sticky and goopy, I worked a bunch of extra flour into it. I think the potato would take care of that.

Mmmmm, this was good.  I used half coconut and half vanilla extracts and coconut milk in place of the regular.  This was so good the next day toasted with butter and apricot preserves.  Had this for breakfast and as an afternoon snack.  My 4 year old thought it was pound cake.  Thanks Teresa

The flavor was decent, and I'm only rating it this low because I am going to try it again and because I changed the rules a little.  I opted to make loaves and bake this bread in a conventional oven. The bread was heavy and doughy, although I did like the flavor.  I plan on playing around with it again to see if I can adapt this for the oven instead of bread machine. I made two 9x4 loaves, and let them rise for an hour in pan after the dough had proofed for a hour prior.  I may have to increase yeast or delete some of the liquid. But, I can see that if you are going to make this in a bread machine, make sure it's a large one 2lbs at least and you may want to halve the coconut extract...a little goes a long way!

I love this bread! It has a nice flavor that isn't overpowering.  I used the "sweet bread" cycle on my bread machine and the loaf didn't seem to be as dark on the outside.  Thanks Theresa for sharing this recipe.

This is a 2 lb. recipe. If you have a 1 1/2 lb. bread machine, reduce recipe by entering "12" into the servings calculator. I made full recipe in 2 lb. Zojirushi & it rose nicely. I sprinkled coconut on top during last rise. This is sweeter than I like bread. Might make good french toast.

Just like King's Hawaiian bread! On my first try of the ingredients, it worked out! The second time I did it, the can of pinapples weren't as fresh just two days laters and made a negative impact. Since I didn't not have potato flakes, I used mash potatos. ** NOTE ** I had to add 1/3 cup extra flour since mashed potatos carry more water than flakes.  My kids love this special treat! So do I :) Over and over again!

This bread was okay, not what i expected.  Personally believe that it doesn't taste nothing like Kings Hawaiian bread. Couldn't taste the banana at all.  Would recommend using pineapple juice than the stuff in a can. Maybe I'll try next time with very ripe bananas.

Easy recipe, I did make changes though.  I added flaked coconut along with the extract, oat bran, and 10grain flour for part of the white to add fiber.  I also did not use all the sugar called for but added more banana.  I do not have a bread machine, so done by hand and in the over, was also worried since it did not rise before baking as others have mentioned.  But baked up just fine.  Good flavor, it just seems to be missing something-maybe added nuts or another flavor?  Will make again.  Great starting point.  Half of it is gone and it has not even cooled yet!

Definitely delicious! One of the best breads I have EVER tasted. But I too experienced an overflow problem, and some parts of the bread came out undercooked, so I may have to resort to baking the dough in my conventional oven. Either that, or I will just downsize the ingredients. I didn't put in the potato flakes (coz I forgot to get some). I wonder if that made a major difference?

Delicious!  The only change I made was increasing milk to 1/2 cup.  My family loved it and we thought the blend of pineapple, banana, and coconut flavors were just right.  No one flavor overpowered any of the others. Wonderful texture. Thank you for this recipe.

I love this bread. After reading some of the negative reviews I was concerned about the bread rising too high and spilling over. (I have a 1 and 1/2lb Black & Decker) It did rise very high, and pressed against the window of my bread machine but so have some other recipes I've used. I couldn't find coconut extract so used vanilla extract in it's place. I set this bread at the light sweet bread setting and it was the perfect color. I enjoyed this the best when it was fresh out of the machine, it was soooo soft and delicious (but it was also great toasted the next day). You've got to try it.

Flavor of this recipe was wonderful.  The loaf is heavy, so to speak.  Came out great in my bread machine.  I did decrease the coconut extract from 1 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Will definitely make again.

Just bought a new bread machine recently, and this recipe turned out excellent! The bread was a wonderful texture, and tasted delicious. It also came out perfectly formed in my bread machine.

This was a very nice tasting bread, but I have to watch it closely to make sure the loaf doesn't get too dark due to the high sugar content.  I have to work hard to make this turn out well.

Yummy, but doesn't taste like King's Hawaiian. Don't sub vanilla extract for coconut extract, tastes like something is missing w/ vanilla. Second time, I made it as directed, except using 1 1/4 c. pineapple and juice, no wet milk, and 2T. dry milk, it was moist and delicious. Edited 3/19/13: Added 1 tsp sweet buttery dough flavor and it overflowed the pan! Surprised that 1 extra tsp liquid could do this! Suggest placing a baking sheet under your loaf pan if you're baking in the oven just in case (I see others have had problems with overflowing too, even w/o any extra liquid).

This is wonderful bread!  I followed the recipe exactly but once the dough cycle was done, took it out and let it rise an hour in a bread pan.  Next time, I want to try making it in a circular pan to give as gifts.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Husband and I tried this when it was hot and didn't like it so much.  The banana flavor was too strong and husband thought the coconut flavor was very pronounced.  Tried it again once it cooled down and those flavors although still there seemed a lot less noticeable.  At room temperature the flavor is similar to Kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread Rolls, but not exactly like it.

Followed the directions exactly.  It was very good and moist.  My husband says he wishes it were a bit sweeter.  I didn't feel like the fruit could be tasted as much as I had hoped.

the first thing i will say is that this bread tastes AWESOME!  however, the recipe itself wouldn't have worked if i hadn't tweaked it quite a bit.  at the end of the 1st cycle (where you check the dough), my dough was very wet, so i added about 1/2 cup flour to it.  unplugged the bread machine and started over.  at the end of the 1st cycle, i could tell the bread wasn't going to rise, so i added the rest of my yeast packet (i think they come in 2-1/4 tsp. packs).  after i did all that, the bread came out perfectly.  if i hadn't been vigilant, i'm sure it wouldn't have risen at all.

This is DELICIOUS! I made 4 batches of it my first week!  My only changes are to increase the recipe by 2/3 (my basis is to use 5 cups of flour: 3 of whole wheat and 2 of bread flour), add 2 T vital wheat gluten (for the whole wheat), 1/4 cup flax seed (for extra healthiness), use olive oil instead of margarine, and coconut oil (it stores with a butter texture) instead of coconut flavoring. (See my custom recipe for all amounts). I let the machine do the hard work, then form it into two loaves or 2 1/2 dozen small rolls.  My favorite loaf was to turn it into cinnamon swirl bread. Yummy!  I used the rolls to make the "Easy Ham and Cheese Appetizer Sandwiches" on this site.  SO good!

Just came back from Hawaiian, made bread and spam! I had bad like at first, my bread was imploding in the center when baking. So I uped the yeast up to 2 1/4 teasoons. Then when adding the ingredients to the bread machine, I mixed the pineapple and bannana into a "paste" and set aside.(I used fresh cut from whole pineapple) I poured 1/2 cup of "paste" in at first, and added the next half a little at a time throughout the mixing. Seems to not overwhelm the yeast at first.

This bread is outstanding.  I beat the egg before I added it, and I smashed the butter before I put it in with the wet ingredients.  The mixture was too dry at first, so I added a little bit more milk, a tbl. at a time, until the consistency was right (be careful, though, because it came together before I noticed and I had to add a bit more flour to compensate!).  I cooked it on the "basic" bread cycle with a "light" crust.  My friends who were over for a Hawaiian-themed dinner found it excellent with the pulled smoked pork we made.

i was so excited to make this bread especially after reading all of the fabulous reviews.  with no bread cooker on hand i proofed my yeast, combined my fruits and other wet ingredients (vanilla for coconut extract) and then stirred in the yeast, milk mixture.  after sifting my flour and salt together i added it to the rest of the ingredients.  My dough was terribly dry I added an additional 1/4 c pineapple to get to right consistency.  I let the dough rise overnight.  Cut into two halves and formed into bread boules.  Let rise an additional 30 minutes.  Baked 35 minutes at 350.  I had to cover the bread with foil after 15 minutes it had already browned.  My crust was way too hard after the amount of time I had to bake in order to cook all the way through and the flavor was less than stellar.  The banana and potato came through too much for my liking.  I may possibly play with the recipe and use only pineapple.  Also cut into more loaves so shorting bake time is required.

I thought that it didn't have enough of the "Hawaiian" flavor I'm used to with the store bought bread.  I may make it again and try and play with the ingredients some, otherwise I'll keep looking.

Great recipe!  I made a couple of minor changes: I used coconut flakes and vanilla extract in place of the coconut extract.  I also had to add about 1/4 cup water during the first kneading cycle because it was very dry.  I used the sweet bread, 2 lb loaf setting on my machine.  The bottom and sides of the crust are slightly burnt; probably should have used the 1.5 lb loaf setting instead.  But inside, the bread is fluffy and delicious.  It would be great for french toast!

Yummy bread.  I used the dough cycle and put it into a loaf pan to bake.  I should have put it into 2 loaf pans.  It was too much dough to get done all the way through.  It came out very doughy.  Next time I will also use just pineapple juice (not crushed pineapple) - I just didn't like the chunks in the bread.  I used coconut, vanilla and a few drops of almond extract.  Next time I will increase the coconut and almond.

I really liked this bread. It was nice and dense but still very soft. Not overly sweet, makes a great breakfast. Next time I will add more pineapple and make rolls. Only change to the recipe I made was replacing coconut extract with vanilla extract.

Sweet sweet sweet.  I loved it.  I added a little bit more milk like some others suggested, but I shouldn't have b/c it was a bit doughy in the middle (but it didn't change the fact that it was YUMMY!)  Nice sweet bread.  Will make again.  Thanks.

This bread is wonderful.  I have made it 3 times in the past 6 days.  It has a really nice texture, even the crust tastes good!  The kids love helping to make it as well.  I used 2 bananas and one (lunch size) can of pinapple tidbits and it works perfectly every time.  Like others, I did not have any coconut flavour, vanilla was a perfect substitute.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a good recipe as written.  Last time, I altered it for convenience: I didn't measure the 2 over-ripe bananas and I used tidbits instead of crushed pineapple. I also added 1-2 cups of leftover fruitcake fruit mix to the dough.
The result was a yummy fruit bread that will likely be a holiday regular for my family.

Very yummmmy!!  My husband couldn't wait to take it out of the breadmaker, because it smelled so good while baking.  It tasted equally as good.  Thanks!

I'm sorry to leave a not-so-positive review, but I was disappointed.  I love Hawaiian bread, but this tasted too banana-y to me.  Not what I was expecting.  It all went together beautifully and the texture was nice, I just didn't care for the flavor.   I'm sure most people would love this bread though so go on and make it, just beware if you aren't crazy about bananas!

This bread is excellent.  It did not bake all the way through on the light setting so next time I will choose medium or dark.  I took the bread pan out and put it in my oven for 10 - 15 extra minutes and it turned out perfect.

This came out awful. The bread was not cooked all the way. It was very raw/doughy. I think it would have been better cooked on medium instead of light. Also, this recipe tastes more like a cake than bread. I wouldn't recommend this one. I wouldn't make it again. Very disappointed.

This bread is wonderful.  My old bread machine doesn't do well with 1 1/2 pound loaves (a new one is on my wish list), so I just use the sweet dough cycle and make a big round loaf and bake it in the oven.  My 5 year old, who "hates" pineapple, loves this bread!

OMG!!!  This is the BEST!!  I JUST received my breadmaker (after much begging) for Christmas a week ago and this is the second loaf I've ever made.  It came out PERFECT!!  I have the Oster breadmaker and no adjustments were needed to make this!!  My Autistic son waited the three hours for this and ate every drop I gave him (which is highly unusual for him).  Thanks Teresa!!

This bread is very sweet and moist.  It is good for breakfast or with a salad for a light supper.  I am so glad I tried this recipe. I know I will use this recipe over and over.

This is the first recipe that ever worked in my bread machine that I was wanting to return to the manufacturer because 4 times the bread was awful & never rose to a full loaf.
These companies put the fear of God in you by telling you that you MUST add the ingredients exactly how they prescribe--as in, don't let the yeast come into contact with the wet ingredients!!  How crazy!  How can the yeast work if it can't come into contact with liquid?
Bread was great!  I used coconut milk & pineapple juice (didn't have crushed pineapple).  Can't remember if this recipe called for an egg or not, but I added a small egg.
So happy to have found this recipe!  I even sent it to the bread machine manufacturer & told them to use it in their recipe book. Thanks Teresa!!

This is a great an easy recipe. I tweak it by throwing the pineapple and banana into the blender to make a purée, but that's it. We use the dough setting on the bread machine and transfer to pans for the second rise. Excellent.

I converted this to an oven recipe by mixing the ingredients and baking at 375 degrees for about half an hour. Came out great. Except for the texture (you can taste the crushed pineapple), this tastes just like King's Hawaiian sweet bread. I was worried that it would be overwhelmingly coconutty because while it was rising, all I could smell was the coconut extract, but I can barely taste the coconut. Also, I did not find that I needed to add any extra moisture to the dough; I was actually worried it might be too sticky!

This could be a bit sweeter for me…to compare with King's Hawaiian, but that's something I can do next time. All in all, I love this recipe. This is the 2nd time. The first time I used my bread maker for the whole process. This time I just put it through the dough cycle, let it rise on the counter after tossing in a bread pan, and then baked it at 375 for 21 min. It got really brown on the top, so I brushed it with butter after I took it out. It also didn't bake as long as I thought it should, but it sounded hollow when I thumped it and it's done on the inside. It was smelling done, which is why I took it out early. Next time I'll try 350 for longer so it doesn't brown as much. I liked cooking it in the oven because the loaf ended up nicer to slice.

I tried this recipe....the only changes I made were adding 3 tbsp of wheat gluten to the flour and substituting water for the milk....it turned out great....I have found that the gluten makes a higher loaf as I use in in other things too such as cream puffs.  The loaf turned out sweet and moist and I will definitely use the recipe again.

This was good, but like the hawiian bread from the store.  After reading the reviews, I decided to bake it in the oven instead of the breadmaker.  It came out good, but rather dense.  My family was not real keen on the coconut extract, but that is a matter of personal taste.  I will try this again and leave it out.

This is so yummy!  The smell is wonderful as it bakes, too!  I didn't have any coconut extract, so I used vanilla as others have done.  My husband and son thanked me as they don't like coconut flavor.  I imagine it can only be better with the coconut!

I used the sweet bread setting on my machine with a light crust, but the crust was *very* dark, especially on the sides.  My husband liked it that way, but my son and I didn't care for it.  The inside of the bread was still very, very moist.  I think next time I'll take the loaf out of the machine earlier, or I'll bake it in the oven.  It could have also been that since we were not home, it sat on the 60 min "warm" cycle and actually kept cooking.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  I can't have King's Hawaiian bread due to the additives in it, and this is an even *better* alternative!

I made with the stated ingredients on the light setting of my bread machine.  Flavor was very good, but the texture was heavy and not fully baked.  I would use a darker setting next time.

I just purchased a bread machine and this was the first thing I made in it. I used the light setting and the sweet program and it turned out wonderful. It was good fresh out of the machine but like a few on here have already mentioned it was even better the next day. I will definitly make this one again.

This is very very tasty just on its own.  I was actually a little disappointed after trying it when it first came out from the breadmaker, as I was expecting something more after all the rave reviews.  The next day though, it tasted so much better!  The blend of flavors is excellent, and the texture is so soft, not dry at all, even after the second day.  While it was rising, I thought it would turn out to be a dense loaf as it didn't rise as much as I thought it would (some reviewers wrote that it overflowed their 1.5lb breadmaker).  It rose very well during baking though, just the right size for my 1.5lb breadbaker, and had a fabulous soft golden brown top crust.  I didn't have coconut extract either, and used vanilla.  Would definitely like to try it next time with coconut and see how perfectly that turns out.  So far, I prefer this bread untoasted (I found toasting detracts from the flavor).

The family loved this bread!  For a kick, we added some extra shredded coconut in the mix.  Tastes the best when sliced, toasted, and eaten with a little bitta butta on top!  YUMMY!

Very easy to make, once I realized the reason it didn't rise the first time was due to old yeast, and a wonderful taste.  
This one will be back on the menue for sure.

My husband and I loved this.  The second time we made it we drained away some of the pineapple juice and felt it left the bread less "fruity" but still wonderful to be eaten with our meal.

This bread is so yummy!!  My mother in law gave me a bread machine, and I've been trying out different breads... I've made 3 loaves in a row of this one!  When I serve it with supper, I have to make sure my 2 year old eats something other than JUST this bread.  She loves it

I'm rating on texture and flavor.  The only thing I did differently was add about 1/4 c more milk because dough was really dry and 2.25 tsp yeast because it seemed wrong.
The bread was very good in terms of look and texture.  That said there was just no banana or coconut flavor.  It was like a very good white bread.  It seemed like a lot of dif ingredients to get to that end.  
Again made a tasty and beautiful WHITE BREAD, but no flavor from banana or coconut came through.
My bread machine  is a Cuisianrt 100bk, I chose 2#, med crust on basic/white setting.  
The ingredients go from wet to dry and yeast in the flour well on top.

This is a very close replica in texture and flavor to King’s brand. I didn’t have coconut extract, so I substituted coconut oil for some of the butter. I’m buying the extract before I make it again, just to compare, but I was very happy with the coconut oil this time. I made this by hand and baked it in a big bread pan with an egg wash on top for that shiny look. I had to bake it closer to 40 minutes because the loaf was so big. Thanks for a great recipe. This is definitely going into my regular rotation.

I made this bread in the oven and it came out absolutely delicious! The only changes I made were using coconut milk instead of regular and changing the coconut extract to vanilla. I put everything into the kitchen aid stand mixer bowl, used the dough hook and let it go for a few minutes. (I did put the yeast into the milk with a pinch of sugar and let it sit for about 10 minutes while I was putting everything else into the bowl.) I let it sit for 1.5 hours, “punched” it down, put it into a 9x5 loaf pan and let it sit for another 1.5 hours. (It doubled in size the second go around.) I then baked at 350 for ~30 minutes. It came out perfect. I can’t believe how much it tastes like Kings Hawaiian. I was very skeptical about that but it does. (We tasted them side by side and while the homemade does taste better, it really is a close call.) Thank you so much for this recipe! For those without a bread machine, do not worry...you don’t need one to make this awesome bread!

The amount of yeast called for in this recipe was definitely not enough leavening for the heaviness of all that flour, mashed bananas, AND crushed pineapples.  As a result, this turned out unappetizingly dense.  I should have made the King Arthur's version instead.  This was a complete waste of time, effort, and ingredients.

Living in Canada I had never had King Hawaiian Bread but was intrigued by it as everyone raves about it. I used the light setting with 3 lb loaf and had no overflow issue, the crust was still quite dark but there is quite a bit of sweetners in the recipe so that is probably why. I used coconut milk for plain as I had no extract, and 1/2 cup mashed potato since I had no flakes. The bread is very soft and has a nice crumb but there is no discernable banana, pineapple or coconut flavour.  I brushed the loaf with butter as soon as I removed from the machine to have a soft outer crust. Good bread but I doubt I would make again.

Great texture!  Used banana baby food as another reviewer suggested, as I'm not a huge fan of banana flavor and didn't want it to come through too much.  Also realized late in the game that I didn't have any bread flour on hand, so I used all purpose and it still came out great!  I did need to add a small amount of water to get that perfect dough ball, but not much at all.  Will definitely make again, and sent this recipe to my mom for her to try out as well.

This was very good. Everyone liked it. I drained the pineapple and added an additional 1/4 C bread flour and reduced the yeast. My bread machine needs less yeast, I think it has a warming cycle on the second rise. My dough always hits the lid if I don't reduce the amount of yeast by at least 1/2 tsp. Very Good. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

YUMMY!!!  This was the first time I have used my bread maker even though I have had it for 6 months and this bread was the perfect initiation!  I did put it on sweet/medium, but I think it would have been fine on light.  The key, I think, was to let it rest for 15 minutes after.  My whole family loved it and we will be making it again soon.  It's great for sandwiches!

This recipe worked perfectly - at high altitude no less. Light texture, not too dry, flavorful!
I used a little flaked coconut in place of the extract. Thanks, I will make this again and again.

Oh, the aroma of this bread baking in the machine is absolutely intoxicating!  One taste and you will be hooked...  I followed the directions exactly (did not add any extra water), and the bread turned out so delicious!  It is even better than a well-known national brand.  Use the sweet bread cycle if your bread machine has it.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe, Teresa!

ADD A EXTRA 1 1/2 TBLSPN OF WATER, AND MADE IN A VERY GOOD BREAD
