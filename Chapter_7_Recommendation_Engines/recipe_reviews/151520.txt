This recipe is a good starting point. HOWEVER... the sauce is too thick and a little too sweet as is. Back the hoisin to 1/4 cup, and add at least another 1/4 cup of chicken broth (total of 3/4 to 1 C. of broth), and maybe even add a little low sodium soy sauce, about a 1/4 cup. Second, there is absolutely no reason to roast the meat. All this does is dirty up another pan, and it takes WAY longer than 15 minutes at 375 degrees to get an average sized pork tenderloin to 160 degrees! I made this recipe as written, and my other dishes got cold while waiting for the pork to reach temp. I will make this again because the peanut sauce has a good flavor (just too thick), but next time I'll just slice the raw pork into medallions ahead of time and pan sear them in my wok. Way less hassle!

we loved it :) i just added more broth to make it a bit more runny, and had to cook it for about 30 minutes. Other than that, it was delicious :)

This was not a hit with us. I made the sauce as written, and it was thick and gluey, and we didn't care for the taste generally. I added more broth to thin it out, but other than that I didn't know what to do to try and redeem it. Sorry, but I can't recommend this one at all.

The previous reviewers are correct, the sauce is too thick, but I don't see that as a major issue.  I thinned it with a little more chicken broth, some sherry, and a splash of soy sauce.  One reviewer suggested cutting back the hoisin sauce, so I started with less than the recipe indicated.  However, I ended up adding the full amount, as I felt it was necessary for the sauce which turned out well.  Also, since the pork is served with the peanut sauce on the top, I didn't think that the seared crust was important to the eye appeal of the pork.  I skipped that step and just roasted it in the oven. Garnished with chopped peanuts and a splash of freshly-squeezed lime juice.

I absolutely loved this.  The pork was pretty basic, and the sauce was made very quickly.  As I was whisking it, I did add a little more chicken broth (not measured, but 2-3 splashes of maybe a tablespoon each?) just to get a consistency I liked.  Based on other reviews, I was concerned that it may be too sweet, but I didn't feel that way at all after trying it, it was delicious!  The hoisin sauce helped add a little saltiness to the sauce and it was perfect.

Loved this recipe! Easy to prep and perfect for a mom on the go. I didn't have any hoisin sauce so used a recipe on this site and only added five minutes to prep time. Literally with rice cooker and steamed veggies was from start to finish a half hour!
