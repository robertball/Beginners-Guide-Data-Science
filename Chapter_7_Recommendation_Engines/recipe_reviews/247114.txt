This was good. I thought it was a little too sweet; next time I would leave out the honey. Otherwise I liked all the flavors and the chipotle spice. Oh WOW I just realized that I used 6 times the amount of chipotle called for. I cut the servings down to 5 but the 1/8 t chipotle chili powder still read as 1/8 t. Since my husband likes things hot I put in 1/4 t for 5 servings!!! It was a bit too hot for me but he liked it. (I think this proves you could definitely increase the chili powder if you like things hot.) I used it on smoked sausage that I served over rice. Thanks for a nice new sauce!

Perfect with pork chops and white rice. Definitely recommend tasting for heat level and adjust Chili sauce and chipolte accordingly as you cook. Really good sauce!

Made this and put it over bacon wrapped pineapple and bacon wrapped water chestnuts. loved it!! the only changes I made was I used 1 cup of brown sugar substituted Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and added a cap full of liquid smoke. I will definitely be using this again!
