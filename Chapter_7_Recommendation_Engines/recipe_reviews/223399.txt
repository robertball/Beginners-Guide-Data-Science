This is one of those rare recipes that on its face are simple, yet yield elegant, tasty results. In other words, it’s a great recipe.
Let me add some comments/observations. Don't be fooled by the batter! It is stiff as noted in the description. You may think you've done something wrong, but the relative lack of liquid in proportion to the dry ingredients makes it that way. Just put the dough in the center of the pan and spread to the sides with a large spatula or back of a spoon. The cooking time (40 minutes) is just right and yields a wonderful texture. 

Like most here, we "tweak" recipes. My only one I used was to substitute Turbinato for the granulated sugar in the topping. That was the only off recipe ingredient. It made a more crunchy top. 

As for the results, it is a lovely cake. My wife, who was born and raised in the Canadian Maritimes where this is popular exclaimed "...this is home." That makes any cooks day! Thanks Christina!

Followed the recipe exactly except added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the butter/sugar/egg/milk combination, but that is a "given" in baking at my house.  It was delicious!  Cake was a wonderful complement to the fresh blueberries.  Didn't take long and was easy to make.  Great with a glass of milk!

This was definitely a 5-star recipe.  It didn't specify what size springform pan to use, so I used the 8" and it came out perfect!  The cake itself isn't super duper sweet, so it goes well with the sweet and crunchy topping. AND, it's really good with ice cream or whipped cream! The only thing I did different was that I added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp Almond extract.  Almond goes perfectly with blueberries. And don't forget to flour the berries first! Thanks for the recipe.. it was DEElicious!!

When it comes to coffee cakes, I am the pickiest person in the world.  I am all about the texture.   Many years ago, I tried a blueberry buckle that won grand prize at a 4-H Fair.   It was to die for!  Unfortunately, I never got the recipe.   I’ve tried many blueberry buckles and coffeecakes  over the years and all  disappointing.   It is with great pride when I say this recipe is a WINNER!  It’s dense, it’s moist, and it’s flavorful.  Perfect with a fresh cup of coffee.  The recipe did not state pan size, but it says 8 servings so  I used an 8” pan.  It took 10 – 15 min. longer to bake, but other factors may have contributed to that.  I didn’t want to make a special trip to the store for fresh blueberries, so  I used a 12oz package of partially thawed, frozen blueberries.  So much for the 8 servings.  Hubby and I completely devoured this a single day, scraping every single crumb from the pan.  Thank you ,Cristina, for sharing your amazing recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! The only thing is there were more blueberries than flour??? I doubled the recipe and only used 3 cups of flour but people loved it just as much without all the blueberries. Thanks for posting!

My son brought over a blueberry buckle for Xmas. It was great and the first time I ever heard of it. So I searched here and found this recipe. I made it last night and before it was completely cooled it was gone! I used a bunt pan like one of the other reviewers because I don't own a spring-form pan. 

The ONLY other change to the recipe I made is using gluten free all purpose flour since as a family we are trying to eliminate gluten from our diet, because my youngest is autistic. This was a big hit and it was rated by the family as better than the one from Xmas, no one minded the gluten free. Gluten free has not always been a success, but this recipe it was. It is a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe.

I struggled on the 3rd step of the recipe. I threw out the batter twice as I couldn't get it fluffy .I just couldn't figure out what was wrong? could it be i use low fat milk?? every time i added the milk gradually,  it curdles... The third try I still couldn't get it right but decided to just follow through the recipe. The dough was so thick and yes,i thought this is so wrong BUT it turn out very nice!My whole family loved it.. And the baking smell that filled up the air in my whole kitchen was wonderful  ! Should have just gone through the 1st attempt. Definitely going to this again. Thanks for sharing!

After picking 12 pounds of blueberries yesterday, I was looking for some new ways to use them and this crumble caught my eye!  I gave this recipe a try this afternoon and am very pleased with the results.  I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of adding one teaspoon of vanilla to the egg/butter/sugar/milk mixture.  I also added extra cinnamon to the crumble part and baked it for 45 minutes.  I don't own a springform pan, so I baked this in a bundt pan instead.  I inverted the bundt pan onto a wire cooling rack within minutes of pulling it out of the oven, let it cool for about 20 minutes, then inverted it onto a plate so the crunchy crumble would be on the top.  This recipe is a quick, easy, delicious keeper!  Thank you, Cristina!  :)

Rarely do I find a recipe that is perfect without a few modifications. Reading other reviews all I added was one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Otherwise the recipe was made exactly per the instructions. I baked this in a 9" springform pan for 40 minutes and it came out perfect. The crumb is delicate. The blueberries plump and delicious contrasting with the crunchy streusel topping. It was gone before it was completely cool. Next time I make two! If you have been looking for a blueberry coffeecake recipe this is it. You won't find a better recipe. Thank you so much Cristina for a simple, quick recipe that family and guests will love. This recipe goes into both my summer and holiday line up.

Update the second time I made this I substituted brown sugar for the granulated sugar in the topping. We liked it even better with the brown sugar streusel topping. While it's tasty cold it's even better when served warm and fresh from the oven (with a 10 minute rest/cool down period). If you plan to serve it to guests I encourage you to put the dry ingredients together the night before. I threw a towel over the sugar and butter in the mixer bowl, also had the butter in the streusel topping mix. Butter was room temperature the next morning so you can have this in the oven in under five minutes.

Awesome!  The topping makes this something special.  Could not stop eating it.  I added just a "smidge" of almond extract to the batter.  Excellent!
UPDATE:  Just made this with fresh strawberries...AWESOME!
Used 2-1/2 C. coarsely chopped fresh strawberries in place of the blueberries.

This is a fantastic recipe and one of the few that I don't have to tweak.  It is perfect as is. Yes, the dough is very thick and you think you are doing something wrong, but have trust in the recipe, it will turn out perfectly.  Hubby requests this recipe every year that blueberries are in season and he is not a "Sweets" kind of guy.  Also, I do not have a spring form pan, so I make it in an 8"x8" square pan or a round cake pan and it turns out great.  If you want to display the cake first before cutting, then a spring form pan is the way to go.

I found this recipe while looking for a blueberry cobbler recipe. I really like this method of baking in a spring form pan.The finished product looks very appealing and slices nicely into neat wedges.
I followed the recipe exactly except I used blueberries I had frozen back in the summer (I let them thaw about half way). I had to bake it a bit longer because of this. The result is just sweet simple goodness. We had it as a dessert with 
vanilla ice cream. Not overly rich and sweet. ...about like a muffin. It would be great as a brunch cake. The crispy crumb topping makes it special.

I made mine in an 8" square glass dish. I have an electric oven and cooked on the lower middle rack, mine was done at 43 minutes. I would suggest putting a tray on the rack below this to catch drips, if any. I lucked out and while it was full to the brim, nothing bubbled over. VERY tender cake. I would not change anything - this is a perfect recipe and I thank you. It's just outstanding.  :)

This is a perfect blueberry recipe! The directions were straight-forward using simple ingredients that I always have on hand. The blueberries stayed in perfect suspension in the cake instead of sinking to the bottom like many fruit desserts. The cake was just sweet enough to set off the flavor of the blueberries, and the touch of cinnamon in the crumble complemented the flavor of the cake wonderfully! Best of all my family loved it! We ate it as dessert last night and are having it with our morning coffee right now! This will find a place in my recipe file next to my grandmother's  cranberry bread... it is that good! Enjoy!

Doubled recipe except for 3 cups of fresh blueberries. Used butter rather than shortening. Used mostly brown sugar (only thing in my pantry). Tasted great. Very dense batter. Cooked @375F for 30 mins in a 9*13 pan. Great, flexible recipe if you need to use up fruit or need a quick baked treat for unexpected guests.

I made this recipe as written, except I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in the streusel topping instead of all white sugar.  This is simply a personal preference.  The cake was delicious.  I will definitely make it again and again.

Made this for my cousins going away  family gathering. There were cupcakes, chocolate and crunch cake. The only item missing was my delicious blueberry buckle.  It was eaten up within 15 minutes! Added 1 tsp. Vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. Almond extract. 
You have to Make it!

This is delicious!  Used unsweetened almond milk in place of the milk because that is what I use in my home. Added 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and almond extracts to the sugar n egg mixture.  Took another reviewers suggestion and used turbinado sugar in the topping.  Other that that, made it as specified.  It took more like 55 minutes baking time in my oven.  Took this to a community gathering and not only was there none left but got many compliments and a few "I didn't get any of your blueberry dessert but I heard it was really good."  Will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. For some reason it took much longer to bake than 40 minutes. Maybe I didn't use a big enough pan? (The recipe never said which size)
The crumble topping is amazing! The cake is fluffy and moist. Very good.

I took the advice of Patty in Plover and added vanilla to it. I also used heavy cream, instead of milk (just because I had it available. Thankfully, I only put the timer on for 34 minutes and that was a tiny bit over cooked. Awesome flavor! Jan

I followed the directions with a few changes. I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon teaspoon of almond extract to the butter, sugar and egg mixture. Great recipe. I used fresh blueberries we had just picked from Martin Blueberries. The house smells so good right now!I will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I accidently doubled the butter and it was still so good.  I think my family will love it. I used a bigger springform pan so mine was only about 3 inches high but looks beautiful and tastes great.

I made this to take to a potluck and it was great.  Chose to make this recipe instead of another because of the smaller amount of sugar in the crumble.  Even though I spilled the milk and wasn't sure about the amount I lost (I added what I thought would make up for it).  These would probably make great cupcakes.

I absolutely LOVED, this recipe!!!!!!! It was so moist and fluffy, and it was definitely worth the time. One recommendation I have is that...don't be worried if the mixture looks and feels thick, it's supposed to be like that. Perfect, as is, no changes.

This recipe,exactly as written, is the best blueberry buckle ever.  Everyone of my family (10 so far) rave about it.   Tonight 9 year old grandson and I will make together.

This recipe was simple and amazing! I added a tsp of vanilla (personal preference) & a few extra blueberries but followed the recipe step by step and it was delicious! It was gone in 2 days. I used an 8x8 pan but I think it would work in pretty much any pan. The batter is really thick so I followed others’s advice and plopped the batter in the middle of the pan, then sprayed cooking spray on the back of a wooden spoon to spread it around. It’s great with coffee or for a dessert etc. would be perfect to bring to any potluck or get together. The photo was from day 2 and I decided to snap a pic before it was all gone. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

It's  very good and the blueberries stay mixed in the cake nicely. The only addition I make is to add vanilla. I happen to like vanilla flavoring in most cakes and I always have it on hand. One tsp works well. I may add butter flavoring, too, because this recipe uses little butter and I like that richness, as well.
I've received good reviews from friends and family when sharing. I use this recipe as a base when attempting a gluten free version.
I live on the Front Range in Colorado where the average elevation is 5000-6000 feet so I have to leave it in the oven for longer; up to 50 minutes total for this cake. Usually I add more flour to make a recipe work at this altitude. This recipe doesn't require the extra but it doesn't change much if I add it anyway. It's a stiff batter so the blueberries don't need to be coated in flour (the customary way to keep fruit from going immediately to the bottom of the pan).

I made this buckle yesterday and only made one change adding 1 tsp of vanilla. I will definitely make this again while the fresh blueberries are available. 1 pint container was perfect. I baked it in a 9inch springform pan for 45 minutes.

This is a favorite in our house. We have several blueberry bushes so my berries are fresh. The only thing I did different was use salted butter because that is all I buy. My husband begs me to make this!

I made this recipe exactly as posted and it tasted delicious.  Baked it in a 9" spring form pan.  My only issue was that it took longer than 40 minutes to bake.  More like 55, and it still seemed a little soft in places.  I'm chalking this up to some really huge blueberries that may have kept it wetter.  That being said, my husband really loved this and I'll make it again using a few less blueberries with the extra cooking time in  mind.

This made a very tasty, not too sweet, dessert.  I added vanilla, as other reviewers suggested.  I am not sure why the recipe does not call for it.  I think it adds more complexity to the flavor of the buckle.  That and the fact that, as written, it makes you guess what size pan to use, is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.

I had to use up some blueberries, and figured I couldn't go wrong with a recipe that has a 5 star rating. It was easy enough to put together, with ingredients always on hand. I did add vanilla and cinnamon as some other reviewers suggested, as I too am a vanilla girl!! It looked beautiful coming out of the oven. I let it cool a bit then pulled off the ring. I took a small piece to give it a try.  My first thoughts were, pretty good, easy to make, not a bad recipe. Then I took my last bite... and thought, well, that wasn't enough. Needless to say, this is a very addictive snack. Every time I pass by it, I cut off a little slice.   So, worth the 5 stars, you bet!!  Will I be making it again.. for sure!  It is a beautiful cake as well, so if you are looking to bring it to a party or give as a gift, you have got the right recipe!

I made this and it is excellent .... I modified to Gluten Free by substituting regular flour with Krusteaz Gluten Free All Purpose Flour otherwise followed exactly.  It turned out wonderfully.  I made a trial cake before making it for an upcoming party.   Now I can’t wait to share it with my friends both Gluten Free and Not will love it.  It is perfect!

This was really great. Letting the top bit get a little crispy was key, so I baked it for about 50min then turned the broiler on for another few minutes.

Added vanilla to batter. Crumb topping doubled. And I had to crumble by hand after using mixer as it wasn't quite doing the job.  Made in 9 " spring pan. Baked 45 min. but feel it was too long. Slightly drier than i hoped.  Next time will make in a smaller pan so the cake part is thicker. Very good.

The only change I made was adding a few walnuts to the topping. It was good -- what's not to like? Fresh blueberries -- kind of more berries than cake, which is okay with me -- cinnamony topping, yum yum! I will make it again when blueberries are fresh and cheap. Plus I like saying "blueberry buckle!"

Turned out beautifully! I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to the batter and sprinkled chopped walnuts over top of streusel before baking for some crunch! Moist & delicious!!

This is very much like a coffee cake but is delicious. I served it warm for dessert with whipped cream. I had a little trouble with baking time because I didn't have a springform pan so used a glass deep dish pie plate. I reduced temp to 325 due to the glass and after 40 minutesit was nowhere near done. So I baked an adfitional 15 minutes at 350. It browned nicely and was delish!

I will sooooo make this again!!!  It was amazing.  Did not change recipe just added two ingredients.  Like many added vanilla with sugar and egg milk mixture, and I added chopped pecans.  My husband took one bite and said it was awesome.  Living in the U.P. of Mi. when its blueberry time it's refreshing to find a recipe like this to use all those fresh berries!!!  Enjoy

I absolutely loved this recipe. the only thing I did do different was to split the sugar for the topping, half white and half brown sugar. I also added 1tsp vanilla extract to the mix as suggested by other reviewers. I do not have a spring form  pan so I used and 8" square pan and let it cook a little longer. I was actually going to make a different recipe until I found this one. I am so glad I changed my mind. Will definitely be making this again.

This was absolutely THE best!  First off, it was really easy and quick to make.  All ingredients I already had at home.  I made it exactly like the recipe except I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh (I have a bunch of frozen blueberries already in my freezer) and it came out terrific.  I only read the reviews about the 8" springform Pam after mine was already in the oven, and I only have one springform pan anyway, it's a 9.5".

Pretty good, but just not sweet enough for me.  Kind of plain.  Maybe if the topping was swirled throughout the batter?  I'll try it that way next time.

It was  absolutely  delicious . I have made it 12 times  over Dec. & Jan. I would split the Buckle in half & gave to friends & clients . Followed the recipe   with minor changes . Used frozen blueberries thawed & used  2 cups  just because I read it wrong but that would have been a lot . . I used white & brown sugar for the 3/4 cup of sugar . When making the crumbly mixture on top  defiantly use 1/2 cup of brown sugar because it is moist & the butter sticks , better. I used a Bundt pan  also used 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 .  I had a hard time giving this away

This came out really delicious. It was soft and moist and definitely not too sweet. I might try the crumble topping with brown sugar next time just to experiment but the white sugar tastes fine to. Definitely saving this recipe, my brother loved it. He's a blueberry person. ?? Great recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the butter/sugar/egg/milk mixture.  It received rave reviews from all who tasted it.  Thank you for the great recipe.  It's a keeper for sure.

Really tasty cake! Like others, I wasn't sure what size spring form pan to use. I used my 9" pan, and ended up with a cake that was about 1-1/2" tall (hope that helps someone else, who may want a taller cake). Baking time was about 43 minutes for me, using my convection oven at 325 degrees (convection is always 25 degrees lower than conventional). The only thing I would recommend is using COLD butter in the topping. Using softened butter has a tendency to create a paste, rather then "crumbles".  I usually use really cold butter, and then just pulse the ingredients in my food processor a few times. Oh, and I also added a bit of vanilla too. Looking forward to having a slice with my coffee in the morning! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is delicious and easy. I used fresh blueberries and wow it's good. I will make this one again.  The butter,  sugar, egg and Milk never became fluffy but I went with it and I am glad I did. Also the batter will be very thick so don't something is wrong. Turned out amazing.

As the previous reviews say , this is an excellent recipe and one you will make more than once  !!! The only changes I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as well as doubled the crumb topping;  this seemed to increase the cooking time a bit to 50-60 minutes . Everyone that has ever had this absolutely loves it !!!!

Awesome is all I can say. I have made this several times. The batter is very thick. You have to press it down into the pan. I always have to cook mine a lot longer than it says to. Like thirty minutes longer. My blueberries are frozen usually but i don't think this would add thirty minutes.

Made exactly as the recipe was written, but used home-grown blueberries that had been previously frozen. I don't believe it diminished the quality of the 'cake' one bit.

This was so good and easy to fix. The only thing I changed was I used frozen blueberries that I thawed first. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Nothing needs to changed, this is perfect as is.

I think this is coffees' new best friend.  Really good.  I'll be making this a lot.  I only added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake batter.

I was going to a party but didn't want to take something overly sweet.  I wanted something nice to enjoy with a cup of coffee. This was the perfect, perfect recipe.  I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination and this turned out decadent.  I will tell you.  I worried about the batter.  I kept going back and rereading the directions - "batter will be stiff." I put it in the oven and crossed my fingers.  I had left enough time if I needed to zip by the grocery store.  Oh my stars, it turned out phenomenal.  I was impressed.  Thank you for putting recipes on the site that a lay person can make - especially when you are just gaining confidence in the kitchen.  This is a definite keeper.

I make this without the cinnamon (for my husband).  I have made this several times.  The last time I made it I took it to a ladies meeting.  They all raved over it!

I made this without the topping because I just didn't have time to do it.  It turned out just fine!  It was moist and delicious.  I don't think it needs the topping.

I can't even begin to say how yummy this recipe is. It's moist & dense & not too sweet. The batter is very stiff & needs to be spread around the pan. Also, in step 3 my batter didn't get fluffy when adding the milk (I did use skim milk). I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla & almond extract (would probably be good with lemon as well). I also floured my blueberries before adding to the mix. I also baked in a bundt pan & it came out great. I will be making this again!

The crumbled topping transforms this good, standard blueberry cake into something special.  Out of habit, I alternated adding in the milk and flour into the beaten sugar mixture, and dusted the blueberries with flour before folding them in.  I would add a little vanilla into the butter mixture next time.
