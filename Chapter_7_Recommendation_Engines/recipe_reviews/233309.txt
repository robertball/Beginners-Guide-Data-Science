Uniquely delicious!  I was weary, if not skeptical, of this dish.  Even the smell when it was done made me wonder what I'd done.  But it won me over with the first bite.  I left out the anchovy due to allergies but agree that they should go in there so if you can do add them.  I also had to use fresh hot peppers.  I ate this dish with and without parmiggiano reggiano and can say it is delicious both ways.  The olives, tomatoes and hazelnuts made for a very interesting texture in each bite, albeit it took a minute to get used to but the flavours were heaven together.  The marsala adds a good flavour to compliment the spice, nut and tang of the other ingredients.  If you look at this and go, "no way!", you are making a mistake.  It's one-of-a-kind flavour will creep up on you and will win you over by the first bite!  Thanks for sharing.

The anchovy paste is necessary.  This was spicy, tangy, bursting with unique flavor and texture. I doubled the recipe to serve 5 people and had leftovers. My company did not eat much of it.  It was a little better the next day, but I still picked out the nuts and I will not make it again.
