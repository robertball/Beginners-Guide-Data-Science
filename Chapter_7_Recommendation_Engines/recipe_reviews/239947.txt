Great recipe! I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. I love it just as it is and so did my boys. My husband liked it also, but he asked me to cut back a little on the vinegar and add more peanut butter next time I make it. He's the one I made this for anyway because he likes peanut sauce. I adjusted the recipe to make 10 servings and the only thing I did different was just to cut back a smidge on the cayenne pepper since I am not a big fan of too much heat in my food. I cooked a 16oz box of spaghetti noodles and the amount of sauce for 10 servings was practically the perfect amount for it. I cooked chicken to go with it, but I think the noodles soaked up most all of the sauce before I had the chicken cut up so I didn't mix the chicken with the noodles. I think next time I'll cut up the chicken and mix with the sauce just before mixing into the noodles, maybe even make just slightly more sauce. Will definitely make again!

Well, this was excellent, but it's not ONLY a stir fry sauce.   I used it as a dressing for a quick Asian Noodle Salad loaded with linguini, red bell pepper, zucchini, cilantro, green onion, carrots, and chopped peanuts...it was delicious!  I put this together so quickly that I even forgot to heat it up.  Used my battery-operated whisk, and the brown sugar dissolved just fine. Made with pantry items that I always have on hand, I love that this sauce can be used in multiple ways.   Thanks Bonnie Gertz!

I didn't read the reviews before jumping into this recipe. I LOVE peanut sauce for stir fry and like to try out new ones often. When I was done making this sauce literally all I could taste was vinegar. I had to add a ton more peanut butter and some water to fix it. I'd probably make it again with rice vinegar and maybe 1/4 of what the recipe recommends.

Really easy and super good! I stir-fried some chicken tenders , pepper strips and julienne carrots, then added the sauce and some sliced green onions, served it over rice noodles. Rave reviews from the family. A couple  things I would suggest: first, that you only heat the sauce till the brown sugar dissolves, as directed. If you keep it warm on the stove, the peanut butter begins to go grainy. Second, I added only a 1/4 of the cayenne called for and there was still a little kick going on. Next time, I want to try adding some chopped  garlic and sauteing it with the  veggies for an extra flavor punch without the heat of the cayenne. Great recipe! Thanks for posting!

Tripled recipe and used for 1lb noodles, ~2lbs of veggies (yellow & green onions, white & oyster mushrooms, & cilantro) & 8oz chicken.  Very decadent tasting but no cream or butter (other than pb).  In terms of effort (easy!), cost (no "premium" ingredients), availability (ingredients all pantry staples I had on hand) and taste (YUM!) this might be one of my faves.  Could be easily vegetarian. I subbed rice vinegar in a 1:1 ratio.

Great (and easy) Thai-inspired peanut sauce. Per reviews, I cut vinegar in half, and it still overpowered the sauce; I countered with more sugar, soy sauce and peanut butter. A dash of sriracha sauce added just enough heat. Great meatless Monday dish! I added sauteed asparagus and red bell pepper to the fettuccine for an all-in-one meal.

This was pretty good, and super easy. Definitely less vinegar, or as midge more sugar... maybe I'd use rice vinegar next time.  I didn't cook it separately, I whisked it all  together & added it to a wok full of stir fry about 3 min before I took it off the heat. I'd definitely make it again.

Perfect! Though I always need to quadruple the recipe to get enough coverage for my large stir fry and rice too.  This sauce makes the  dish!

There's a reason this is rated 5 stars! Excellent recipe with powerful flavor and minimum ingredients. I don't normally rate recipes on this site, but this sauce is spectacular. Thanks for posting it!

Recommendation: chop cilantro on top of the finished stir fry. Cilantro adds a bright, fresh flavor that complements the peanut sauce very well.

This was so good and very easy to make. I doubled the sauce recipe, but not sure I had to. I didn't have ground ginger so I used fresh. Added more peanut butter and less vinegar. Added this to one pound of spaghetti, shredded carrots, green onions, thinly sliced red pepper, cilantro, chopped peanuts. I think I may add a splash of fresh lime juice next time too. It was really good!

I used rice vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar it still turned out really good. It doesn't look like it makes much but when I mixed it with my veggies a little goes a long way. Really good.  Strong flavor a little spicy in a good way.

I made this for a cold Asian salad.  It was Fabulous!  I made the sauce for 12 servings, which went nicely with a box of linguine.  Like other reviewers I only put in 2 TB of rice wine vinegar even with the serving size change.

The foundation of a good recipe is here, but the proportion of ingredients took a LOT of tweaking to make it as good as the rating made me think it would be.  I made it the first time as written, but the taste of vinegar and soy sauce completely overpowered any other flavors.  To make it palatable, I added another full measure of peanut butter;  more brown sugar,  garlic and ginger; and diluted it with water to thin the consistency back out.   It was okay, but not great.  The second time I made it,  I started with half the soy, a fourth of the vinegar (rice wine vinegar this time), and added water until the amount of liquid was right for the proper consistency.  For more peanut flavor, I used smooth peanut butter, and added chopped peanuts at the end.  And finally, I added a half-teaspoon of sesame oil to add more nuttiness.  I made it several hours in advance, to give the flavors a good chance to blend.  MUCH better;   it tasted great tossed with cold rice noodles.

It was great! Used it with some stir fried pork, carrots, and sugar snap peas. I left out the brown sugar to cut down on the sugar.

This was a really great sauce.  As another reviewer mentioned, we quadrupled the amount so it wasn't dry.  We did have some left over, which we'll use for another future stir fry!

Great recipe as is. Only caveat is that it will thicken very quickly so make it as close to serving time as possible.

Amazing sauce! I usually make about 2-3 times the amount that this recipe calls for as I cover chicken and/or rice for dinners. It is very flavorful and easy to make!

I made this for the first time last week and it was awesome!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only being a little generous with the amount of brown sugar added.  The sauce came out pretty thick at first, but once the stir fry chicken and veggies were added (peppers, broccoli and onion) the consistency was perfect.  The sauce is peanutty but also has a nice slightly spicy bite to it.  I doubled the recipe but could have made even more because it was so delicious.  Try it!  It's so easy to make and you'll love it!

Didn't make any changes. It was so dark that I thought I'd done something wrong. So I made it again, this time using the microwave instead of the stove. They tasted basically the same but it wasn't that great. Won't use this recipe again.

Used basalmic vinegar and smooth peanut butter instead. Also did not warm up in saucepan but instead mixed it in a bowl. We poured it over a soba noodle stir fry and it was delicious!!!

So easy!  Adding to my recipe book for sure!  I mixed with steak and stir fry veggies.  Added more peanut butter because I was wanting more of that flavor.  Definitely recommend!

Just enough, sweet, just enough heat, just enough peanut butter.  I really enjoyed the flavor and will make a bigger batch next time.

Changes: Rice Vinegar, Fresh Ginger & Fresh Garlic. The rest I did the same. What a difference the fresh ginger & garlic made. The Rice Vinegar is smoother than Red Wine Vinegar too. Next time I'm going to use some home made Apple Cider Vinegar which is even milder.

I really liked this sauce, but I did listen to what others said and tasted as I went. Even my pickiest eater enjoyed it. I have another recipe, but it's expensive. I added this to my recipes. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you so much for sharing!

So this recipe has a few...issues. It's a great base but I'm glad I read the reviews because with them it ended up turning out great. I agree with cutting out the red wine vinegar and instead adding half a Tbsp rice wine vinegar instead. I used it as a sauce to put over chicken and veggies  (I finished them in the sauce to increase flavor), but the sauce was too thick. I added half a cup of chicken broth and it was perfect. All in all, with the changes I'd make it again. It's delicious.

Triple this recipe to make it for four people!  Unless 2 TB is enough per portion of stir fry.  Not in my family!

I doubled this and used half as a sauce with a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies. I'll use the other half to add to a noddle/veggie salad and also a dipping sauce for pot stickers. It was a little tart for my tastes, so I'd cut back on the vinegar; had to add more brown sugar.

Great sauce!  I halved the vinegar like others.  I used mango riced vinegar. It was delicious!  With chicken, peppers and carrots. We will definitely have this again.

Very good recipe; I put it on stir fried chicken and bok choy.  I made some changes only because I had some ingredients but not others.  I used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and  true via instead of brown sugar. It still turned out very well.

This was amazing.! So simple and delicious! I did add about a half cup of water to thin the sauce to the consistency I like. Next time I would cut back on the brown sugar too only because my family doesn't like sweet meals.

What I did is (and recommend to everyone making this dish), I started out putting in all the other ingredients first, then put in the rice wine vinegar in to taste.  It comes out better that way.

Excellent and easy recipe! I made it exactly as written and both my husband and myself really enjoyed it. I thought the flavors balanced each other out well, and there was no need to cut back on the vinegar or cayenne as others suggested. I know that's really a personal preference, and I do not like anything too hot/spicy (or overpowering with vinegar) but I thought it was perfect as written. I decided to use up all my veggies in the fridge, so I sautéed asparagus, zucchini, broccoli, red & yellow bell peppers, jalapeño (seeded because I can't take the heat), and onion until all were slightly soft. I served the veggies over spaghetti squash (my favorite substitute for pasta!) and poured the sauce over top. It tasted fantastic! Can't wait to try the sauce with a meat protein, I'm sure it will go well with anything!

My daughter made this with Cocoa Aminos and Sunflower seed butter since she can't have soy or nuts.  She added a little extra ginger and we all wanted to lick the bowl.

WOW!!! I love this!  I’m a big believer in one pot cooking, so I actually cooked this in the middle of my veggies. I just pushed the veggies aside so I had a little well for my sauce ingredients.  I added a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it up.  I didn’t have crunchy peanut butter in my pantry so I used creamy instead.  It definitely works, but if you can do the crunchy. I suspect the peanuts add a pleasing extra crunch that was lacking in mine.  This will definitely be a go to for me from now on.

Seriously, an awesome stir fry sauce. Soooooooo easy. I try and decrease sugar in all of my foods, so I doubled all spices, and cut brown sugar in half. AMAZING. I literally made a delicious stir fry out of freezer burned veggies, some left over chicken, and a couple fresh veggies. I was certainly impressed.

This was great! I diced up three chicken breasts and sautéed it with a bag of stir fry veggies and added the sauce which I adjusted to serve 16. I cut the vinegar in half based on other reviews. Then I tossed everything together with a pound of thin spaghetti noodles. Delicious!
