I've used a similar recipe for years.  30 minutes at 350 degrees won't do it, however.  I do 45 minutes at 450 and get a nice crispy skin.  Little remains of the fat, and the thigh remains tender and juicy.

I have used this recipe for years.  I always basted my chicken with butter first.  I also use onion powder if I don't have flakes.

Very tasty and easy! Added the salt, pepper, paprika, and butter and, through some experience and COMMON SENSE I added on some baking time. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this isn't enough time to bake bone-in thighs unless they're really small. And if you're a rookie, using a thermometer (as the recipes suggests) is a great idea. I don't understand why someone bombs a recipe because of his or her own inability to recognize an undercooked piece of meat. Sorry for the rant.

Great simple recipe on which to build other great flavors!

Next time I add fennel and red pepper flakes, to give it a smoky charge!

For those of you who use thighs with skins, get your spice mixture UNDER the skin so that it actually flavors the MEAT, and not just the skin!

This is one of those recipes that you can change up how you want, but the basic recipe method is great. I used legs and thighs. I didn't measure the spices, just sprinkled liberally over both sides and added paprika, black pepper and kosher salt. I drizzled just half a tablespoon of butter over the top. I served it with couscous and was able to spoon some of the pan drippings over it. I also served it with "Fresh Corn and Zucchini Saute" from this site. Very nice meal.

Quick and easy enough recipe yeah, but after 30 minutes in the oven the chicken wasn't even half-way cooked through. It's still in the oven with raw spots an hour after putting it in.

Chicken thighs on the bone, I would put in the oven for 50-60 minutes. Also, for simplicity, mix spices into one jar and save for future use. I'd mix seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.

I made this for dinner last night, and it got good reviews from the family.  Darling Daughter said she DOES NOT like chicken thighs, but ate some anyways.  It is a quick meal to put together, and we had it with corn and a spinach salad.  I did not have onion flakes so I substituted with chopped sweet onion, which I think worked fine.

Thanks for the recipe.  I will put this on my rotation.

Simple and easy. Use your favorite seasoning mix and I poured melted butter over the chicken and baked as noted. Perfect! BTW - the drippings make for excellent gravy.

I had some boneless, skinless thighs I needed to cook. My husband is a white meat person, but loved this! My only changes were onion powder instead of flakes, added Adobe seasoning, and paprika. I didn't measure seasonings, just sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray and applied seasonings liberally and then rubbed into thighs a bit. Baked at 450 for 30 minutes. Came out perfectly cooked!

I roast my chicken thighs at 400 degrees for an hour.  I also drop bits of butter over the chicken to make sure the skin really crisps up.  Nothings worse than a little blood near the bone, to make you not want to eat your food.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked the chicken at 450. I placed the chicken on a rack over a pan. Unfrotunately, I got sidetracked and cooked it for 1 hour instead of the 40-45 minutes. Way too overdone. I used the spices in the recipe as well as black pepper, definitely needed some salt or maybe as another review suggested, brush chicken with melted butter. I gave it 5 stars because the concept for crispy oven baked chicken is there, just needed tweeking.

To be honest I can't give this five stars because I didn't technically make the recipe, but I followed it as a base. I used 6 chicken boneless skinless chicken thighs. I put a tablespoon or so of vegetable oil in the pan and lightly soaked the thighs. Then I added 1 teaspoon of salt and about 4 teaspoons of old bay seasoning. I did what others said to do and cooked it at 450 degrees for about 40 minutes. Making it this way comes out amazing! They will be super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside!

After 30 minutes, the chicken was not crispy nor was it even done! It was raw inside.  Try cooking it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, and it will come out crispy and done ;) I guess you call that a Pro Life Tip! lol

This recipe has a very quick prep time. 
Made this dish with onion powder instead of flakes since I didn't have those. I am fairly certain it wouldn't have made much of a difference in the way they came out. The chicken was much too strongly garlicky/oniony and there was not much else to taste. The skin was unappetizing looking as well - I think basting it would have helped. I tried adding a sprinkle of chili powder but it didn't add much flavor. I added another 25 minutes since it was raw at 30 minutes. I was hopeful the recipe would be tastier than it sounded since I had only a few minutes to figure out what was for dinner, but unfortunately it wasn't.

Reading the other reviews it goes to show you that you have to judge your cooking times based on the chicken you're using. All these people saying 45 to 50 minutes would have left me with worse than chicken jerky. 

For me, the cooking time was about 18 minutes with thawed, bone in, pre-brined thighs. Luckily I checked my thighs at 13 mins (my usual cook time with breasts) with an instant read digital thermometer so didn't ruin them.

This is very similar to my go to seasoning for chicken. I use sea salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and mixed dry Italian seasoning. I don’t pre-measure, Just generously sprinkle all sides of the chicken til it’s well coated. It makes any cut of chicken from a whole bird to your favorite pieces, roasted, grilled or pan fried, so flavorful and delicious with a natural pan sauce that’s so good, that you can also thicken if you want more of a gravy. The only reason I gave this recipe only 3 stars is because it doesn’t tell you to season with salt and pepper. I can’t imagine not seasoning any protein with S&P, it would just not have any flavor regardless of what spices you use.  Plus it definitely needs more cooking time. Especially if you’re using bone in thighs. 45-55 min is more like it. I like a crispy skin so set my convection oven to 375, which equals 400 in a traditional oven,  and bake in a pan or baking sheet big enough so pieces don’t touch for about 45 min. Comes out perfect every time.

This was a super easy and great recipe. It could easily be adapted to your level of spice as desired. I had a large enough batch of chicken, that I was able to try a half of it with and half of it without a rack. Half of each of those were simply dredged in flour and the other with seasoned bread crumbs or panko. Surprisingly enough, the ones without the rack were actually juicier and without a greasy texture. I used boneless, skinless thighs and they took about 25 minutes per side. I can't wait to try this again with chicken breast to see if it is as good.

I just used salt and it turned out great! Really crispy. It's become my favorite method to bake chicken thighs.

I did the directions to the T as far as ingredients but followed another posters directions on time and temp. I did 475 degrees for 50 min and it was cooked fine, nice crispy skin but I wasn't crazy about how only the skin had flavor and the flavor lacked any salt. It would be worth perhaps trying to force more seasoning under skin, maybe butter and herbes de provence?

Yes, I made changes. I used onion powder instead of flakes. I also added cayenne pepper, smoked paprika and Hungarian paprika. This adds an amazing finally to chicken thighs.

The recipe is simple but cooking at 350 for 30 minutes is not sufficient.  Cook at 400 for at least 45 minutes, as another reviewer did.  Recipe should be changed to reflect that.

This was a good simple recipe. I used boneless thighs so I put chopped garlic in the middle for an extra kick. I also cooked it with carrots and potatoes. It was good. Lastly I did cook it on the higher temperature for longer as one reviewer suggested

Really great recipe for those nights you don't have time to fuss with making a big spread.  Made recipe as written. ...Perfect temp but needed 15 more minutes. ..next time I'll add a little salt, besides that, excellent addition to my chicken recipes.

This chicken was so so easy to make and it was really yummy! The whole family loved it including my 3yr old. I removed all skin and put a little butter then seasoned and cooked at 450 for 45 mins and it was perfect! I have no idea how it would have possibly been done in 30mins at 375 in my oven there's NO WAY that would have happened.! Went great with seasoned baby red potatoes and sautéed asparagus :) yum!

I only left one star out because I had to turn up the temp and cook them longer.  I did 450° for about 50 minutes.  I seasoned with the same recommended ones in the recipe, under the skin, over the skin and underneath.  My spouse said it was the best he's had in a long time!

This was delicious and moist. I put it in the oven for 35 minutes. It didn’t turn out like the picture, so don’t expect any crispiness if you follow the directions (hence the 4 stars). I served it with a side of green beans seasoned with McCormick’s garlic and herb. Easy meal :)

As per other comments on the page, I cooked the chicken for 45 mins at 450°

Added cumin, salt, and pepper to chicken instead of garlic and onion powder to better fit the recipes I was making with this chicken.

I made this recipe using garlic salt and sprinkled parmesan on top of the chicken.  It made a nice crispy oven baked chicken that was a nice substitute for fried chicken. It took an hour to cook.

However  30 Min is not nearly enough time for baked chicken Thighs- I used Paprika plus used your bland spices suggestion. I cut up a onion fresh garlic, a little olive oil & butter ! mmm so good . Put in a roaster pan add a 1/2 cup of water ,cover pit into the oven 1 Hr. take off the aluminum foil or top and then crank up the oven to 4 or 500 for about 20 min . Flip Paprika that side base with the juices yummy. Brown rice and baby spinach...

I was sceptical at first I am used to shake and bake style crispy coatings so when I was putting the mixture of garlic powder and dried onion bits I was like I don’t know but it was so simple and I donged the heat up as someone mentioned it was soooo good so glad I tried this.

After putting it in for an extra 15 minutes beyond what the recipe called for and the chicken still being 30 degrees from done, I decided to up the temp to 425 and put it in for another 5. Hopefully it'll be done this time around.

Used onion powder in place of onion flakes. Was very good for kids that don’t like that “bite” of onion.  I also used boneless thighs. Mostly cuz that’s what I had on hand. Definitely will fix again.

I made it but I accidentally added chili powder instead of paprika on one of the thighs. I think it should turn out okay since I added in melted butter while it was cooking and the timing for four thighs is not accurate. It takes an hour to an hour and a half but I think the flavor should be there.

I will certainly make this again! Followed the recipe as written. The only change was the BAKE TIME! I needed, as other reviewers, to continue baking the chicken thighs at least another 30-40 minutes! I think you have to account for the size of the chicken thighs. The ones I used were quite large. Sometimes the chicken thighs are quite tiny which may have been the case in the original recipe’s cooking time. 
Otherwise, this dish was fabulous! Husband and I really enjoyed these tasty chicken thighs! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavors. I agree with other cooks. adding chicken or paprika would make a delightful meal. but just as is, is just as good.

This was quick, easy, and I was able to make it in my convection toaster oven--a plus.  I used 6 chicken thighs, as they were rather small, but they took up a 9x9 Pyrex dish.   I used onion powder instead of flakes, because I had it on hand.  I also added a little salt to the chicken first.  I thought it was good, but it seemed a bit heavy-handed on the garlic--and I like garlic.  When I make this again, I'll probably just toss the chicken in the garlic/onion/salt mixture, then place it in the pan, rather than sprinkling them on separately.  It seems the best way to get it coated.

This recipe says to cook the thighs at 375  degrees for 30 minutes.  That is simply not enough time to cook bone-in thighs.  They should be cooked for  50-60 minutes.    The onion and garlic flavors are tasty indeed.

This easy recipe makes juicy chicken. At 30 minutes the skin was not as crisp as I like. So I  cooked it at 400 degrees for an extra 15 minutes.  The skin was crisper and the chicken was still juicy.

My entire family loved this recipe.  I took other viewers advice & baked 400 for 20 minutes, which was perfect.  I brushed each thigh (bone in w/skin) so the seasonings would stick better.  I used cayenne pepper, garlic salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion flakes.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Thank you!

I used Lipton’s Onion Soup mix for the seasonings. Took one package to season five thighs by shaking them in a bag.
Baked at 450 for 45 minutes.
Great flavor and nicely crisped! And, so easy.
Will definitely make again.

I have a convection over so at 425 these thighs were done in about 20 minutes. The only things I changed was to add tumeric to the seasonings and top with fresh herbs. I made this chicken to compliment a mushroom risotto.

My skinless/boneless thighs resulted in a decent but not particularly delicious meal.

Great recipe! Easy, quick, delicious, inexpensive and healthy.
I put a thin pat of butter under the skin of each thigh along with a pinch of Herbes de Provence under the skin in addition to the onion & garlic powder and salted & peppered each thigh. Has to be baked at 450 degrees for 45 minutes. Great with just about any side.

Beware!  Thighs won't cook bone-in that fast.  I cranked the temp to 400 and instead of cooking the chicken in it's own fat, I lined a pan with foil and cooked them on a rack.  I cooked it for 50 minutes to get the right temp.  

I used sweet paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper, and cayenne.  Served with honey dip.  It was spicy and crunchy and delicious.

I made this when someone moved and gave us all their frozen items. I don't really care for thighs but this recipe is my exception. It was easy and delicious. Thank you!!!

This is not the best recipe I've ever tasted, but it's certainly one of the easiest, and my husband enjoyed. I added able a teaspoon of butter to each thigh. I thought it was too much garlic powder with the chicken, so I made half with full ingredients and half with half. I definitely preferred the half version.

I will make again.

Really didn't change anything until I re-heated it the next day.  This is definitely a time saver.  And quite good.  Some of the leftovers were great as a sandwich.

Excellent, my husband does not like thighs....with this recipe he had seconds. Change: Rubbed thighs with olive oil then added seasoning including red pepper flakes, cooked for 60 minutes  @ 350. This is a keeper.

Super easy!  I made this as written the first time.  I wish I had read the reviews because baking at 350 for 30 minutes was not near enough.  Next time I will use the suggestion of 450 for 45 minutes.  The skin should be much crispier using this baking method.  I found the basic recipe rather bland, but you can definitely change it up or spice it up to suit your likes/needs.

I like chicken with a crispy outside and tender inside.  I fried it on the stove until it was golden brown and then added it to the oven.  After the 35 minutes I ladled on some home made BBQ sauce and baked about another 15 minutes.  Although I really didn't stay entirely true to the method, I liked the result and will make this again.

It was simple and easy. Loved it but used boneless thighs and  removed skin and added Ponzu for moisture which made great gravy

I used onion powder instead of flakes. And I dripped half tsp of soy sauce on each thigh.  But I'm also positive it would be delicious without the soy sauce.  My family loved it, and I loved how easy it was to make!!  Definitely going into the rotation.

Wondrously simple and absolutely delicious.  Just note that bone in thighs have about twice the cooking time.

My oven is super-hot, so on every recipe I make I have to take it back 3-5 minutes.  And whenever I make chicken, I usually throw it in a bowl and season it lightly with Adobo and half a pack of Sazón seasoning.

I thought these were good.  My husband thought they were great.  I did skin them and used onions powder instead of flakes.  Will make again.  Quick, easy and flavorful.

I consider myself a cook. I follow recipes and look to the comments for suggestions. This was perfect as it was written. I used a temperature probe built into my oven and set it for 170.
I put in a baking pan on a raised grate. The fat drained but the chicken stayed moist, crispy and tasty

I used different seasonings but followed the directions as far as time and temperature were concerned. I lined my pan with foil for easy clean up.
