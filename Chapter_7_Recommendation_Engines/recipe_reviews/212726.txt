These bars are always a hit and they are soooo easy to make. I usually make with sliced almonds since we usually have them sitting around the house. Very yummy!

I have made this many times and it is a crowd pleaser! It's always the first dessert to disappear at a potluck-style gathering. I have also forgotten to brown the crescent roll crust and it still works - not quite as good, but it works. I usually chop the cashews into all bits - too many halves aren't a little cumbersome for biting into!

I would have thought the nuts would balance out some of the sugar but that was not the case.  The crescent roll layer didn't work with the filling at all.  I won't be making this again.

I made these for Thanksgiving and ended up bringing almost the whole pan back.  Only 4 got eaten.  The sweetened condensed milk stayed runny and the crescent rolls just didn't work with this in my opinion.  I much prefer the 7 layer cookie.

I was very very disappointed in this recipe - lots of expensive ingredients, and the flavor was very bland. There was just no contrast in flavor among the ingredients to give you a little "wow" moment.  I'll stick with the traditional Magic Cookie Bars recipe anyday!

These were an interesting way to use crescent rolls. The condensed milk tasted like caramel and was very sticky. I liked that there was not much required in the way of baking. They were very easy to make.

These looked so good.  The texture was great but the flavor left much to be desired.  Needless to say, this will not be a recipe I will be making again.

Great in theory; in practice not so much. You'd be better off sticking with the old Magic Cookie Bars recipe.

This is a fantastic, quick version of "Magic Bars."   All my guests loved them and asked for the recipe.   PLEASE BE AWARE that, after baking for 25 minutes, they are going to come out of the oven swimming in condensed milk.   This is okay.   Do not add more time, and do NOT put them back in the oven (as I did the first batch I had to throw out...).    Move them to a wire rack and let them cool down for 10 minutes.   Then, refrigerate them until they are hard (well over an hour for me).    This is such a quick way to make a sweet treat.   Use your favorite ingredients, sprinkle them with coconut, and use whatever you have on hand.   They are great.

I wouldn't use this again. I didn't care for the crescent layer at all. I prefer a magic bar receipe to this any day. The rest of the ingredients were good, the crescent layer is what ruined it for me.

So easy to make and was a big hit at our family get together!  I started to cut the bars when they were still warm which didn't work well.  Make sure to refrigerate for 30 minutes per directions.  Great recipe!

I made these exactly as written. They are super easy to make and pretty tasty too. The crescent dough bottom leaves you feeling like something is missing though. It wasn't bad but a shortbread crust would have been better.

Wow this came out great!  Although I will admit I was sceptical up until the last step of chopping them up into bars.  Initially they look like pizzas.  Also, my condensed milk dripped off the sides and that stuff will carmelize/burn all over your pan.  If I were to try again I would maybe try to add the condensed milk between the layers.  But despite all this they came out really good.  I left mine in the fridge for two to three hours to solidify.

This are pretty good but the evaporated milk pooled and bubbled up in some places.  Also I thought the crescent dough was a bit too "dinner roll-like" - next time I'd use dough sheets.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I ended up using walnuts, milk chocolate, butterscotch, and white chocolate chips.  They just looked bad from the minute I took them out of the oven.  They ended up being really sticky and gooey.   The condensed milk was just in big, runny globs, which was pretty disgusting.  I realize now that I misread the directions and didn't let them cool for an hour before sticking them in the fridge.  Perhaps thats why they ended up that way?  I don't know, but I don't plan to ever try this again.  I rated them 2 stars, not because of my errors, but mainly because I hated the crescent roll bottom.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE crescents, just not as a crust in a cookie dessert.  I'll stick to rolling crescents up with meat and cheese!

These are AMAZING! I can't believe how easy either. This is definitely going to be my go to dessert. Very little work and effort for something that tastes yummy. I added a cup of peanut butter chips because, well, why not? YUMM-O!
