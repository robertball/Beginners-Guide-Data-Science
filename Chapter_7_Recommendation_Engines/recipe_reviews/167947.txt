This was very quick and easy to make and it tasted great. I used 1/3 cup of A1 and 1/3 cup dressing for one very thick rib eye steak. I had some of the marinade left over but I did not pour it on the steak after it cooked. I enjoyed the flavor and I would make it again.

Very good on filets as well.     I made this one night without the oregano because I ran out - still tasted very good!

I agree with the user who said this is good, just needs a little bit more of a kick.  Just what that is though...unfortunetly I'm not sure of yet.

Excellent for those who like A-1! Went very well with a crunchy romaine salad and a crusty roasted garlic bread.

Pretty good, used fresh oregano and just used balsamic vinegar. I so used HP suace sine I didn't have A1. Interesting way to cook steaks but the steak sauce was overpowering.

I did not care for this steak AT ALL. I'm a steak lover and I couldn't even finish mine. The A1 was completely overpowering and made the steak taste cheap and family diner-ish. I will not be making this again.

I saw this recipe and that it had no reviews as of yet and was hoping to be the first to give it a review. I guess 3rd will have to do. I gave it 4 stars because I think it needed a little more kick to it. Maybe with the Bold A-1 would be better. Hubby didnt rant and rave about it so I gave it a 4 stars as well. I may use this again but just "jazz" it up a bit.
