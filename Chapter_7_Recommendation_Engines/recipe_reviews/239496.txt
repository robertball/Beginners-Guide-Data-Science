As the recipe is written, it is a nice but rather bland soup. I used a roasted garlic salsa that I really like but it didn't add nearly enough spice to the soup. I have never had a posole that didn't have some cumin, chili.. etc.. and I really felt it needed that. I did like the butternut in this. I did not add the optional cream.  After I jazzed this up with some spices, I really did enjoy this. so do make this.. but have your spices ready

Overall this was a tasty dish, however it was a tad bland. I added chili powder, garlic salt, half a chopped onion, and used chicken thighs to add more flavor.

This was so yummy!  I followed the recipe, and added onion and garlic and chili powder, per other's suggestions.  I used leg and thigh meat, and pinto beans because I had them already.  I did not have any beer, so just used stock.  I also used a tomatillo salsa, personal preference.  I did not add the whipping cream, but I am sure that would have added another layer of flavor.  Great way to use up butternut squash!
