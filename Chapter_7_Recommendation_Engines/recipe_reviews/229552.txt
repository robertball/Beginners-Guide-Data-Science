I made these this morning following the recipe exact only using Andes peppermint crunch baking chips instead of crushed candy canes. I loved that I did not have to refrigerate the batter, I just mixed it up and was able to bake it right away. These cookies were done at nine minutes and once I pulled them off the sheet and let them cool on the kitchen counter, they were absolutely wonderful. One of the best sugar cookies I've ever had--they are soft, chewy and perfect. They look like something you'd get from a bakery!

These basic sugar cookies are very festive topped with crushed peppermint sticks. My kids love these, and they're great for your holiday cookie swap too!

Really good with the addition of the crushed peppermint sticks/candy canes!!! ..I'm so glad you added the kitchen note of how much shortening in cup measurements as we don't have "sticks" of butter/shortening here in Canada.. I looked forward to trying it! Thank-you!!!

These turned out very flat for me and were extremely hard to get off the cookie sheet after the two minutes of cooling - they pretty much fell apart.  The cookies themselves taste fine, but I won't make again due to the fact that they just didn't turn out for me.

NOT impressed.  Peppermint stuck to the cookie sheets- what a mess! At least the crumbles tasted good.  NEVER again!

These cookies were great! The peppermint looked very festive and cute on top. The only thing that bugged me was that the finished product sort of reminded me of packaged drop cookies that you can buy at the store. They're awesome when you know you made them by yourself, though. Great recipe to give as a gift!

Wonderful! I tried this with 3/4 C Splenda, 1/4 C sugar and 3/4 C + 1/8 C butter and the cookies turned out wonderfully tender and rich. They're especially good topped with a mix of mint chocolate and crushed mint candy. So festive. Will make these again and again.

This is an absolutely no-fail recipe, with delicious flavor, a festive holiday look, and dough that is easy to handle.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out fabulously! I got 50 small cookies out of my batch. 10 minutes in the oven was perfect for that wonderful texture of slightly crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Use parchment paper to avoid sticking. Be sure to gently PRESS the candy into the cookie immediately after removing from oven.  Also, I advise that you crush the peppermint candy to pieces that are about the size of MINI chocolate chips. Don't over-crush like I did -- powdered candy does not convey the desired effect! They look and taste wonderful...I'm giving these cookies away as gifts for Christmas this year.

Awesome holiday cookies.  Made exactly as written.  I will make these often and probably even again in a few days because I know they won't last long around here.

I baked these last night and like the other reviewer, I used Andes crushed peppermint baking chips instead of candy canes. Oh my goodness, these are amazing! Definitely one of the best sugar cookies I've ever had. It's the perfect combo of chewy with a little bit of crunch. They're buttery, pepperminty, sugary goodness! I did not add the extra peppermint on top, but that is because I added extra peppermint to the batter. I will absolutely be making these again.

I've made this twice.  The first time I made exactly as directed and I ruined half of them because they stuck to the cookie sheet so bad.  The taste was great though and everyone at work requested I make them again.  So, I did with some changes.  First, I used 1/2 C butter flavored Crisco and 1/4 C salted butter instead of all Crisco.  Second, I buttered the cookie sheets.  Third, let the cookies cool on the cookie sheets on cooling racks for more like 5 minutes.  Fourth, butter the spatula after every other cookie or so.  I only ruined 2 cookies the second time.  I rated this recipe based on my first attempt following the directions exactly.  The taste was 5 star.  The stickiness and difficulty brought the overall score to 3 stars.

I doubled the recipe and used the Andes Peppermint Crunch.  I used a small cookie scoop and got 9 dozen cookies.  They came out great!  Will definitely be making them again!!

Very yummy. I find it hard to crush candy canes, though, so my pieces were probably bigger than they should have been. This led to them sticking to my baking sheet, tearing them as they came off the sheet. :( I will try baking them on parchment paper; it may help with this. Also, the candy kept falling off the cookies after adding them to the baked cookie, so I had to push them in a bit.

These were ok.  Overall, it's a decent cookie, but there isn't much peppermint taste to them - I would definitely suggest putting more candy into the cookie dough before baking.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I know it's going to be great!  I'm adding it to my Christmas cookie baking list along with the rolled sugar cookies for when my 5 grandkids come over for our annual Christmas cookie baking and decorating get together!

My family and I love these!  I forgot to get the holiday colors and used the regular red and white candy canes.  Every time I take these somewhere I am asked for the recipe.  They are soft, flavorful and the crunchy candy cane on top adds nice texture even though adding it after they come up is kind of a pain it is completely worth it. The dough itself comes out wonderful for changing up as well.

Used all butter. No shortening. Cooked longer. PUSHED candy into warm cookies. Substituted for the Andes peppermint baking chips. Used wax paper. Yum.

Absolutely fantastic cookies!  They are quick to make, use up the candy canes from the Christmas tree and taste great!  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, and I found the trick is to use parchment paper!  You have to let them sit for a few minutes before transferring them to the cooling rack.

Tasted good. They were extremely flat and extremely soft. They even turned brown as they flattened- continuing to flatten even after I took them out of the oven.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 rating because the results were *very* yummy, but I'll probably not make them again.  Our local grocery store was giving away cherry candy canes after Christmas so that was the only substitution I made.  The reason I won't make these again is because, as was noted by others, the candy cane melts while baking so this created a huge mess of my cookie sheets.  Someone said they used parchment paper which maybe helps?  However, I don't use parchment and can't afford to buy it for one recipe, no matter how yummy it turns out, so I guess this is one recipe we'll enjoy while it lasts but not repeat.  One tip, though...  if you're not using parchment do *not* let the cookies cool before removing from the sheet!  The cookies come off easier if the candy cane is still hot and liquidy.  All you have to do is press firmly and swipe quickly with the spatula and the cookies will come of with not too much trouble.

Thanks for sharing!  Sorry for the negativity because these cookies *are* very tasty!  :)

I've made this recipe only once so far, and I made it as written. I found this to be just a VERY good, basic cookie recipe. Yes, they were very good with the crushed peppermint candies, but you could add pretty much anything to these cookies -- candy chips, raisins, dried cherries or dried cranberries or even just plain -- and they would be just as good. Yes, the crushed peppermint candies (I used starlight mints) DO melt when baking, but I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper, which facilitated clean up as well as the removal of the cookies from the pan. (The "trick" to removing the cookies from the pan neatly is to allow them to cool for a minute first.) The biggest mess I had was with all the candy pieces on my countertop after sprinkling the crushed candy on the finished cookies. No problem. I just vacuumed them up as I went along. The recipe says to use three dozen pieces of candy, but, with the starlight mints at least, I found that to be WAY too many. After using the amount specified for the dough and for sprinkling on the baked cookies, I had quite a bit of crushed mint left over. (Hmmm. Maybe I could use it in my hot chocolate?) Also, although I didn't actually count, I don't think I got quite the three dozen cookies that the recipe claims. Oh, well. I can always increase the recipe. I WILL be making these again!

I didn't have any crisco so I used butter...maybe that was the issue. I thought they were only okay...had the same issues with sticking but not a big deal.  I just didn't think they tasted that great.  Has anyone else used butter.  Mine were very thin also is that how they are supposed to be?

I'm not a big sugar cookie fan. But, I got wonderful reviews from the people I made these for. To me, they were a little undersweetened. But, my opinion seems to be the minority. Sprinkling the tops with candy canes did prove to be a tad messy. But, cleaning the baked candy canes off of the cookie sheets was fairly simple to do with a cookie scraper. I would make these again for holiday gatherings.

Made as directed and came out great! I baked on parchment paper, so the candy didn't stick to the pan.  I had relatives as me for the recipe!  I also put the candy canes in a ziploc bag and let my first grader smash them for me. I got a nice powder out of that idea! :)

This is a nice recipe and the cookies turn out well,however, I guess I am not a mint person because I was not too crazy about how they taste.

Awesome recipe that I tried last week.  They are all gone and I want to make some more but only have 1/2 stick of shortening left.  (I do have sticks of shortening and butter in my part of Canada.)  Has anyone tried margarine or butter and are the amounts different?
