The first time I tried this recipe it was ok...maybe a little lackluster in flavor but I tried it again with a few tweaks. I marinated my chicken overnight in a homemade mojo. In lieu of water I used an unsalted chicken stock as well as the chicken bouillon plus added some onion and a clove of garlic to the simmer. The changes made a huge difference in the flavor and the final dish.

Omg!!! Chicken and Rice Spanish style with a twist! Who knew boiled chicken in tons of seasons, fresh minced garlic, chicken bouillon, chicken stock mixed with red peppers, rice with saffron, olive oil and some lime baked to perfection would yield this mouth watering meal?! Here's how I played with it a tad: I used 2 cups of Chicken Stock and 3 C of water to boil with the chicken boullion. I then used red pepper and added seasoned chicken (red pepper flakes, season salt, fresh minced garlic, onion powder, pepper ). After removing chicken Instead of pouring the liquid into baking pan I added rice and olive oil to the skillet and then poured it all into the baking pan. I semi shredded my chicken on top, hitting it with a little juice of lime and into the oven. When it was ready to come out I cut up lime and viola! The best meal I've ever made! Everyone loved it!!

I thought this recipe was great & easy to make. Made mine with diced tomatoes with green chilies, plus green & red peppers, about 3/4 cup and used chicken broth and 8 chicken tenders that I cooked and then shredded.  Used 2  5oz packets of saffron  yellow  rice.  It turned out great.  This is one recipe I will be making again.

This came out awesome and it was so easy to make! I replaced the green pepper with green peas. This is the way I'll be cooking my Chicken and Yellow Rice from now on.

Absolutely the easiest chicken and rice recipe . I did modify a few minor things to suit my tastes however over all this is a great foundation too begin . In place of water I used chicken broth too boil the chicken, while boiling I added garlic powder and  a garlic herb seasoning . I then added a can of mixed veggies when it was time to assembly everything and last thing is for my rice I use Mahmata (spelling is perhaps wrong ) spicy rice . Yummyyyyy :)

YES, I will be making this dish again! My teenagers devoured it. I liked the helpful tips and the listed items that were on sale nearby. It made cooking so much easier. The ONLY changes I made were adding seasoning to everything (we are a little heavy handed in that area), and also keeping the rice in the oven a little longer because my oven is old fashioned.

Very easy and yummy! I added chopped onions and seasonings to the water with bell peppers before throwing in the chicken. I cut each chicken breast into thirds, and later into smaller pieces after cooking to absorb max flavor. Added rice right into the broth with olive oil and stirred well. Let everything simmer stove top in a covered pot - didn't use oven. Served with some Lebanese garlic sauce - perfect!

Very tasty quick easy chicken and rice recipe.  I tried the recipe  as written the first time and it is very good.  I used Goya Yellow rice and seasoning.  The second time I added red & green bell pepper and onion with a little garlic.  I used low sodium chicken stock instead to control some of the sodium.  Either way it is very good.  Would highly recommend trying this.

This was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I added was some diced tomatoes, a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic, and a little cayenne pepper.  I don't know why people are so afraid of the green peppers.  It's not like you would taste a strong flavor of nothing but green pepper!  Good grief!  It's diced and if you didn't see it, you wouldn't know it's in there, but it compliments the dish, whether you like them or not.  Just close your eyes, because the flavor that it gives is delicious!  Thanks for sharing such an amazing, easy casserole recipe!

Family loves this!  I sautee the pepper, onion, garlic then add Goya Sazon & a can of tomatoes.  I boiled the chicken with boullion and chicken seasoning, then shredded and removed the chicken until the end since the first couple of times I made it the chicken was dry.  I boiled chicken broth instead of water.  Great and versatile recipe.

OMG! This was so good and so easy. I borrowed these tips from other reviews: use red and green bell peppers; use 2 cups chicken stock when boiling chicken. 
Things I did on my own: add some green olives and pimentos, omit olive oil (that was by accident but I didn't miss it), and three more chicken breast. 
As I was cooking for a meal train, I was glad the yield was large enough to feed two families!

This was super simple to make, and my family loved it.  I did use chicken broth instead of water and bullion.  The only suggestion I would have would be to turn the chicken breasts over about half  way through the baking, as mine got a little dry on the top.  Will definitely make again.

Came across this recipe while looking for a way to use some leftover roasted chicken which I diced up. I put in 1/2 onion and a clove of garlic in the broth (low sodium chicken broth) and simmered it for about 10 minutes. Left out the bell pepper as my family is not a fan.  Mixed this with the rice, poultry seasoning and pepper and baked it covered in the oven for 45 minutes. The house smelled heavenly and the meal turned out awesome. Will add this one into my quick, easy and yummy file.

I used unsalted chicken stock to replace 2 cups of the water. I'm far from an experienced cook and always looking for simple dishes that my picky eaters will eat and this was a HUGE hit. Simple and delicious.
  Thrilled to have another dish to add to the rotation!!

I really liked this recipe. It was easy and very tasty. I substituted about 1/3 cup dried lentils for the bell pepper though and was really happy with it.

I cut the chicken into cubes, & browned it before adding the liquid, I used 32oz. (4 Cups) of chicken stock in place of most of the water ( of which I only used a 1/2 Cup) & soaked the rice in 1 Cup of Chardonnay while the. Chicken cooked, poured it over the rice mixture & added an additional 4 TBS. of butter, covered with foil & baked @  425°  For 40-45 minuets...... Delicious !

This is my new favorite dish! I keep a large stash of yellow rice, so I used 1 1/4 cup of rice instead of a box kit. And 3 garlic pods - can never have too much. Following other suggestions, I partially shredded the chicken on top. Lastly I added a can of peas directly before putting the dish in the oven. Absolutely outstanding!!!

Cook time is wayy too long, should have known that. 45 min in 425 degree oven after a 20 min stove top simmer dries out chicken.

YUM This was so good and so easy. We love chicken and rice - without the creamy canned  soup - This is Perfect. Hubs loved it. Made according to directions adding only more veggies - more peppers and some mixed veggies. This is such a great addition to our rotation. Thanks so much  Noty 661.

You never said on how large or small the chicken breast should be.

Do you cut the chicken into pieces, shredded or leave whole,

Very yummy, I added chicken broth instead of water (and still use the bullion). I also used poblano peppers to spice it up a little.  The chicken was very moist and the rice was full of flavor.  Highly recommend.

I omitted the peppers, only because I didn't have them, but the finished dish was delicious!  Will definitely make sure I have green peppers next time.

Very easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of others and used chicken stock to replace 1/2 the water for simmering,  also added onion, garlic, and red bell pepper.  Since my husband likes the green olives our local Cuban restaurant puts in theirs, I added olives as a garnish and that put it over the top...that extra little salty kick it needed.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was amazing! I did add green pepper like it suggested and it made it taste even better I believe. Totally going to make this again!

Great meal, and very easy. Kept as is, except Chicken Quarters instead of breasts threw in 1  1/2 cups black beans  and used Better Than Broth vs. bouillon
