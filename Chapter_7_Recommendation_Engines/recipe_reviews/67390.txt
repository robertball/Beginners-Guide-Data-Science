Im not sure what kind of mustard Mary Jo intended for this recipe but I used up the rest of my dijon mustard and had to use a little bit of yellow mustard to get my 1/2 cup.  It turned out wonderful.  Quite spicy for the kids  but they still ate it.  It turned out kind of runny so I cooked it down some to make it thicker and we topped this on brown rice.  It tasted great.  Thanks for the post.

This appetizer was awesome!  I was a bit hesitant about making it because of the odd ingredients, but I was pleasantly surprised at the delicious results.  Everyone raved about how great they tasted.  Liked the sweet and tangy combination.  Will definitely make again.

Really good, I think I may add a little more mustard to take down the sweetness a little more.

Didn't have jalapeno jelly so used apricot and added 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes...also, felt lazy so used 1/4 cup chopped dry onions instead of fresh.  Had some smoked sausage I had to use up so I used that as well as polish sausage.  For the little bit of effort involved, this is really good.

Thank you Mary Jo for a wonderful, easy recipe.   I did cook  on low for 6 hours or so, and tilted the lid so the sauce cooked down some and the kielbasa slices even browned  a bit.  Guests loved them!!  I am a Mary Jo also, by the way! Don't come across too many of us:)

Great recipe! For the mustard, I did half dijon and half spicy brown. I took it to a potluck this last weekend and there were no leftovers.

My family loved this recipe!! My husband requests it all the time. I broiled the sausage some before putting it in the crockpot. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.

For ease of preparation and flavor, this recipe can't be beat! After reading some of the reviews, I used more mustard to cut the sweetness. I used 1/2 c spicy brown mustard and 1/4 c of yellow mustard. I cooked over medium heat for 4 hours. This was a big hit at last night's party. And as an added bonus, the extra sauce was very popular for dipping chips in!

I made this for a potluck.  Very tasty.  I used yellow mustard and the jalapeno jelly. We put steamed rice next to it to easy the spicy for some people.  Thank you - quick, easy recipe.

Greasy and sweet! It needs something else to balance the flavor. Not ever making it again.

Very good but runny. I am not sure how you could serve this with crackers, and I think next time I'll try white rice. The flavors were amazing and I am curious if other people tried this with something other than crackers or rice. My husband loved it and so did I, will definitely make this again.

Substituted raspberry jelly for the jalapeno, but this was because Walmart didn't have it.

Little too sweet with the jelly I used. I'll try it again if I can find the jalapeno jelly.

I just didn't feel like dragging out the crock pot, so I did this stove-top. First, I sauteed the kielbasa pieces (sprinkled garlic powder on them) in oil/butter until they were nicely browned (~5 min) and removed to drain on paper towels. In the same pan, I added the chopped onions and some tri-color frozen peppers that I wanted to use up, also cooking for 5 min. In another saucepan, I added red pepper jelly (not jalapeno), the mustard (combo of yellow, spicy brown and Dijon) and kielbasa. I cut back on the jelly and mustard amounts because my kielbasa was 13 oz, and I didn't care if I had a lot of sauce. To that I also added garlic and onion powders and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. I let it simmer on low for 25 min.  Pineapple chunks would probably work nicely here. I wanted to have on hand for the Superbowl tonight. Good luck Patriots!!!
