Every asks me to make the cheese ball now, and I can do it even when I'm exhausted and pregnant because it hardly takes any time, everyone loves it -- even people who don't like meat, and I always get asked for the recipe...

This was by far, the easiest and best tasting cheeseball I have ever made. I served it as an appetizer during Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law just thought I was the greatest because it was the first homemade cheese ball she had EVER eaten. I love her, but she doesn't cook..ever, and just buys everything already made from the grocery...including cheeseballs. It was a lot and I thought there would be some leftover, but I was so wrong. I've made it several times since and am always asked to bring it to get togethers now.

GREAT cheese ball!  I added green onions and used Sharp Cheddar Cheese.   I serve this cheeseball for every year at our Halloween Party.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made it for Easter, using black and green olives and chopped HoneyBaked ham.  It was a hit with my in-laws!  My 6 year old even liked it.  I can hardly wait to try it with crab and/or shrimp.  This is a wonderful "basic" cheeseball. Thanks Kati for sharing this recipe!

Made this for a Christmas day appetizer and came out great! Bought a little bit more walnuts than recipe called for and shaped into a log instead of a ball...seemed to make more sense since other people said the ball came out quite large. Added some of the ham I made for the dinner and omitted olives. Wonderful!!!

I did not care for this at all!  The ham and black olives just made it taste gross (to me).  I do agree with Katie Rose's suggestion to alter it to your desires, which I may try and do.

Just like my mom's except we use green onions instead of olives. I always make ahead to help the flavors meld, holding off on the nuts til right before serving so they don't get soggy.

I had never made a cheese ball before but this was super easy.  You could use a little more ham and the whole can of olives and it would be better.  You could also use imitation crab which would be good.

This is such a versatile recipe.  You can't mess it up.  Anything goes with the cheeses.  I used black olives and jalapenos. Delicious and impressive to guests.  Thank you for this staple for parties.

Easy to make in the food processor.  And it was a big hit at the get together.

This is a nice hearty cheese ball. I used "real" finely diced smoked and elected to sub banana peppers for olives because olives are gross (at least in my world).   It was a bit salty (probably because the banana peppers, though I imagine olives would be just salty), but still delicious.

Came out much larger than I imagined. I might try again for a very big party. Was a little hard to keep rounded, but that gave it a homemade look.

Used recipe, but substituted dried beef for ham.
This was excellent. Thanks, Kati Rose.
