What a pretty, dainty little cake! I prepared this exactly as written, using an 8" springform pan. No need to change a thing as it is simply perfect as is. It's moist and flavorful with a just right sweetness. The raspberry filling and the topping both make this especially pretty. Hubby was going to take this to the office in the morning for his staff but, um...oh well, at least there's a big piece left for him to take for himself!  Hmmm, and he always  said he doesn't care for coffeecakes...

This is my favorite recipe from this site.  I have made it several times.  I do agree with other reviewers that it is best to double it.  When I do, I use a 9 inch pan.  It fills in perfectly.  Though the recipe is good with frozen berries, it is BEST with fresh ones.  If you do use frozen make sure to drain off as much liquid as possible to avoid a runny mess.

Wow. What an amazing cake. And it's super-easy too: all you need are a few bowls and a big wooden spoon; no need for your mixer. And the taste is heavenly. I skipped the glaze given in this recipe and instead came up with my own chocolate glaze: 2 ounces Belgian dark chocolate and 4 ounces Belgian milk chocolate melted in the microwave, with 1/2 cup hot whipping cream, all whisked briskly together with a fork. The combination of raspberry, almond and chocolate was heavenly. Possibly the best coffee cake I've ever made.

This recipe was incredibly easy and went over fabulously well.  Doubled the recipe and used a bundt pan - same cooking time.  Roasted 1/2 of the almonds to put on top when icing.  Would definitely make again.

This was a great cake!  I used almond extract instead of vanilla & raspberry yogurt instead of sour cream & it turned out wonderful.  Can't wait to make it again!!

Excellent! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. I made this twice: once for Mother's Day and for a potluck. I was asked to make it again because it was that good! The first time, the cake didn't even last a day before getting gobbled up.


When making this second recipe, I used a springform pan rather than a plain 8-inch pan like I did the first time. Much easier to get the cake out of the pan, but make sure the pan is securely set because raspberry juice will drip out onto the oven floor. And make sure you have enough cooking spray in the pan so that cake will be easy to remove.


The first version I made did not have glaze, and we loved it regardless. The second version I made did have glaze. I didn't care much for the glaze; it was so sweet! I think this cake stands out on its own without it! Still, your mileage may vary.


I used frozen natural raspberries. They work great. But make sure they're thawed before measuring them out. And be sure to drain the juice, too. Also, in both recipes, I followed the other reviewers' advice and doubled the recipe. It was very difficult to spread out the batter into the pan the first time. The second time, I added a few tablespoons of milk, and it made quite a difference! Don't worry if you don't have enough batter to spread out on top. The almonds will cover the cake nicely.

YUMM...I used previous recommendations in preparation.  I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 (I think doubling it would have overflowed my 8 inch cake pan), added 2 tablespoons of skim milk to wet ingredients, spread 2/3 of batter, then raspberries, then final 1/3 of batter, and omitted the frosting.  I did not have sliced almonds, but I did have whole almonds, so I ground them pretty fine in a coffee grinder and sprinkled them on top, PERFECT!  Really looked like a crumb top!  I will definitely make this one again, moist, sweet, and lovely.

My family raved when I made this for the Forth. It looked and tasted great garnished with some fresh raspberries and served with vanilla bean ice cream. You must double the recipe otherwise there is absolutely no way you will have enough batter. I used a nine inch cake pan and it turned out wonderfully.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla and next time I will toast the almonds before topping the cake.

Followed others' advice: doubled batter, added milk.  Turned out lovely, but it was still a little dry.  I chose not to make the glaze (because that seemed too dessert-like), and instead sprinkled it with powdered sugar.  Also used blackberries instead of raspberries because they looked so much better at my market.  So it turns out it's a flexible recipe, but it worked better for me with 2-3 tablespoons of milk added and next time I'll probably add even more.

I have now made this three times, once as a small cake and twice as muffins.  This is a five star recipe for three reasons.  1.  It is absolutely delicious. 2.  It is easy to make. 3. It is simple to substitute.  First time I baked as is, was wonderful so I tried it a second time with a mixture of alpine strawberries and raspberries with orange extract instead of vanilla - amazing.  Then, I tried it again with blueberries and almond flavoring - heavenly.  I will keep using this recipe in every way that I can think of and I can't imagine that I will stop enjoying it!

This is absolutely fabulous. It has become one of our favorite raspberry recipes. The batter is is kind of hard to spread out, but with patience it works and the results if wonderful.

Mmmmm! So yummy! The mixture of the different tastes was  brilliant. Not too sweet. Changes I made and would suggest:  I doubled the recipe and used a 9-inch round cooking pan and cooked it for only about 5 extra minutes.   For the raspberry and brown sugar mixture, I drained the excess juice after I mashed the raspberries and sugar. I mashed in a handfull more of raspberries to the juice and added about 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and used that as the glaze instead. SO GOOD! It also stopped the raspberry filling from being too watery and making the cake mushy.   I added 2 tbsp. of milk to the batter so it would spread easier. It also made the cake more moist.  I sprinkled sweetened coconut and granola on the top of the cake right before putting it in. Next time I will add more coconut and nuts.  Hope that helps you all! Happy cooking:]

This recipe works so well with other type fillings.  So far, I've used Blueberries, Cranberries, Apples and apricots using the basic Raspberry recipe.  Each one has been a winner.

Excellent! I doubled the amount using a 9" springform pan. I used fresh raspberries and almond extract instead of vanilla in both batter and the glaze to bring out more almond flavor. The batter was a thick consistency making it challenging to spread in the pan. I carefully spread 2/3 of the batter then the raspberry mixture over. However, I was a little worried the 1/3 batter left didn't seem enough to cover the top. I topped it off with a little chopped whole almonds plus the ¼ cup sliced almonds to give more of a crunchy top layer. I enjoyed the wonderful raspberry aroma that filled up my house. The cake rose up nicely while baking filling up the 9" springform pan-just perfect! It took 10 more minutes to bake and it turned out beautifully-golden in color with red raspberries peeking out! This is a great combination of flavors. It's perfectly moist, light and pleasantly flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness. The fresh raspberry filling and the topping both make this a delicious and pretty coffeecake. (See my picture in the photo gallery) The cake itself is delicious and stands out on its own. For the glaze I had to add 1 tsp. more milk for the right consistency. It was sweetened just right adding a great layer of almond flavor. I love the crumb almond topping which added the perfect crunch and texture. The addition of fresh raspberries puts this right over the top. This is the best coffeecake I’ve made both in flavor and in appearance!

This is so good! We love it. Followed recipe with the exception of using almond extract and half and half in the glaze in place of vanilla and milk. Perfectly moist, pleasantly flavored and the addition of fresh fruit puts it over the top. Presentation is pretty as well. We will enjoy this many, many more times. Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time for this recipe for me and it won't be the last! It has great flavor.  I doubled the recipe and used 4 c. of fresh raspberries.  I added 1/4 c. of milk and used 1 t. vanilla and 1 t. almond in the cake batter. Instead of sour cream, I used plain vanilla yogurt. I toasted pecans and put those on the top.  It was baked in a 9 inch springform pan which was just a perfect size.  It needed more than 40 minutes with the extra raspberries so I added almost 10 more minutes of baking time.  I did glaze the top since it's a very small amount of glaze and served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was a hit!

Wonderful. Not too sweet, so it's especially wonderful with the glaze. I made a little less of the glaze for the sake of cutting back on sugar and that was fine. I doubled the recipe, used white whole wheat flour, coconut palm sugar and almond extract in both the cake and glaze. I really like using various extracts, even when the recipe doesn't call for it, because it's the way my mom always baked. She's old world European and her cakes are the best! Don't mean to ramble, but this cake rocks, especially with the flavors of the almond and raspberry. Thank you for the beautiful recipe!

Very good! I followed exactly, except I used light sour cream, added 1 tbsp buttermilk to make it super moist, and added a streusel topping ( 2 tbsp ice cold butter diced, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp flour). My coworkers ate this up!

I'm not feeling the love!  I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't turn out at all. The batter was very difficult to work with.  The end product was unevenly cooked and didn't taste well.

I've made this recipe 7-8 times now & everyone LOVES it (both as breakfast or as dessert, served warm & topped with ice cream!)   Because my cake pan is more like a 9" (rather than an 8" as recipe calls for) and the batter part of this recipe barely makes enough to cover the bottom of the pan (much less needing to cover the raspberries), I usually make 1 & 1/2 times the amt. of batter (flour, sugar, baking powder&soda, salt, cream, butter & vanilla extract and 2 eggs).  This gives you enough batter to spread on the bottom of the pan, top with raspberry/brown sugar mixture and still have enough batter to spread on top.  Bake about 5 minutes longer.   Delicious even leftover a couple of days later! Travels well & makes an excellent hostess gift.

I made this coffee cake today using fresh blackberries...used two cups of them...it turned out GREAT and the taste was to die for.  My neighbor loved it...said it was a "prize winner"..in fact, she asked for the recipe. I doubled the recipe and used a 9 inch spring form pan and baked the cake for 50 minutes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper...THANKS SO MUCH for sharing such a GREAT recipe.  Will make this coffee cake over and over again using whatever berries I'm able to get at our local store or farmers market.

I've made this recipe 3 times.  I too thought the batter was a bit thick, hard to spread, and a little on the sparse side.  However it turned out beautifully.  I really think if the batter was increased by 1/2 it would be just about perfect.  Nevertheless, it is a beautifully simple coffee cake that doesn't even need a mixer.  The almonds are a wonderful combination with the berries.  In the end, it was delicious and simple to make.

Really good.  Tried a   second batch with yogurt because I ran out of sour cream.  It turned out good, but not as good as with sour cream.

Yummy, easy recipe!  I made mine in a loaf pan and omitted the glaze (because I don't like coffee cake too sweet).  I used a mix of frozen rasberries and frozen blackberries.  After adding the brown sugar to the berries, I let them sit for a while and then drained the juice out before putting them in the cake.  I will certainly make this again!

Delicious!!  Followed advice of previous reviews and doubled the recipe.  It came out perfect!  Love the combo of almonds and raspberry.  I have tried several recipes on this site and almost everything has turned out well.  Really appreciate the reviews and find them very helpful.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a springform pan. I used raspberries from my garden and light sour cream. It came out great. My family loved it.

One of my favourite recipes!  If the cake looks a little thick, I add a tad of milk.  I really like this with blackberries but any berry works.

This was really delicious! Fresh raspberries are a must, in my opinion.  I followed the recipe as is and thought there was enough batter for an 8 inch pan.  There were certainly raspberries peeking through the top but it looks pretty that way with the almonds and the glaze on top.

Oh my goodness, the raspberry almond coffee cake was so yummy and very easy to make. I doubled the recipe as suggested by many of the reviewers. I also thought I might have made a mistake because the batter was really thick and barely covered the bottom of the pan. It turned out perfect. I am so pleased with this recipe that I am going to look at other recipes that Melissa has submitted. You will look like a rock star if you make this for guests.

This is so simple and delicious. You could use any berries I think. Yes, is is thinner compared to a slice of cake but I like that. I only had to bake mine for 25 mintues so I would definately watch the time.

WONDERFUL!  I always make this with whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and it's still wonderful!  I - personally - add almond extract to the cake and icing, instead of vanilla.  I think that it really enriches the flavor!  The first time I made it, I was concerned about not being able to spread the batter on top like I wanted, but it turned out great anyway.  I usually make two at a time, and freeze the leftover individual slices.  After taking them out of the freezer, a quick spin in the microwave is all they need.

This cake was very good. I made it with blueberries too - which I think was better than the raspberries.  I added 2 Tablespoons of milk to the batter - no problem spreading the top layer.

This recipe was just "okay".  It does taste good, but it hard is enough batter to make a "cake" let alone what I consider a "coffee cake".  It is not really a coffee cake, too small, but rather more like a regular cake, cake.  If I made it again I would double the recipe, for sure.

When adding flour mixture with moist it did not mix well. It was too dry, added 3 tablespoons of milk to mix. Batter was easier to work with then. Overall this was great! A new favorite in our home.

I think this as written is a 3 star coffee cake, the batter is too thick and needed some milk as other have said, also as written I found the cake part to lack flavor, the second time I made this I added a little brown sugar and cinnamon to the batter and used almond extract instead of vanilla. Doubled as others have said. For icing I drizzled a chocolate ganache that I flavored with Framboise. the chocolate/raspberry paired very nicely.

This cake is a beautiful little cake, and so very easy!  I did use frozen raspberries and drained them; didn't have any problems with runniness.  This makes a small coffee cake; if you have lots of people to feed, yes, you may want to double it, but I'd definitely use a larger pan if that is the case.  This would work well with an 8 inch cake pan but with more batter it'd overfill.  For ease, I used my springform pan, which would be able to hold more.  Although I rarely have this happen, 40 minutes was perfect for me in this cake.  I really liked the raspberry flavor along with the almond, but felt less almond would be fine as well.  However, the almonds and raspberry are just so darn pretty together!  I left off the glaze and I don't miss it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed suggestions of other reviewers and added milk since the batter was very thick and not-so-manageable. i made it with strawberries instead of raspberries because my boyfriend is picky and said he didn't want raspberries. I didn't double the recipe since it was only for me and him, and we'll have it for breakfast for the next couple days. I didn't make the glaze since I wanted it to be more breakfast-y than desert-y. I will definitely make again, it was very easy!

I had higher hopes for this cake. The presentation was impressive, but the taste was bland and unexciting. The ribbon of raspberry running through was tasty, but it wasn't enough to inject some much-needed pizazz into the cake. I didn't change the recipe except for that fact that I doubled it, as many recommended, and I am glad that I did because it would have been a very shallow cake otherwise. I think the taste would have been improved by using almond extract instead of (just) vanilla to add some flavor to the cake. However, this is not a recipe I will be making again because I just don't think it is worth it.

I did not use the 3 tablespoons of brown sugar on the raspberries and I used frozen raspberries. I think it would have been better if I had used fresh fruit and/or added the brown sugar. Thanks for posting!

I used a mixture of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries that I had on hand.  I felt there was not enough batter so I doubled the recipe and used a deep dish pie plate.  I baked it on a cookie sheet but only a small amount dripped over the edge.  I also subbed half the sour cream for buttermilk.  Had to use about 3/4 cup buttermilk to get the right consistency.  I used slivered almonds instead of sliced.  Followed as written otherwise.  The end result is beautiful and very tasty.

This cake always turns out well - I make it with yogurt instead of sour cream and as mini cakes in a muffin tin, using the same layering method.  They are delicious.

My first attempt at coffeecake and it was SO good!  I was really worried because the batter was extremely thick and I was using a 9 inch springform pan instead of 8 inch...but wow!  It looked beautiful and tasted even better.  Since I used a bigger pan I cut back on the baking time and only baked it for about 15-20 mins.  Pretty & perfect...can't wait to make it again!

Tasty!  Super easy to throw together.  I also used blackberries instead of raspberries since they looked better, also I only had light sour cream and it worked just fine.  Baked it for only 28 minutes and it was done, used an 8 1/2 inch pan since that is what I had. Used chocolate instead of the glaze since i was using this for dessert.  Perfect dessert, not too heavy but very yummy!

We love this little cake especially me because it is so easy to make. Wonderful eaten fresh with icecream.   It does make quite a small cake indeed and better if you have a 7 inch pan.   Have also used blueberries or blackberries in place of raspberries.   Any of these fruits are acceptable.   Thanks for submitting and will be enjoyed often.

I loved how this recipe showcased fresh raspberries instead of using preserves - I was looking for a delicious recipe to use the fresh berries we've got up here now and this cake definitely fit the bill. I made as written and used a pie pan - the batter was EXTREMELY thick and kind of hard to manipulate into the pan, very similar to those little biscuit mix pouches you buy and add water to. I got it spread "mostly" to the edges, added the berries, and then dropped tablespoons of the reserved batter on top almost like dumplings. However while cooking it filled in to the edges of the pan and spread out on top, and the raspberries looked very pretty and tempting peeking out under the batter and almonds. I did skip the sugar glaze this time and while it didn't *need* the glaze I think it would really set the berries off in the future - you could also add a layer of flavor by using orange or lemon or almond extract and really change up the cake to suit your mood. Versatile, simple, delicious and fresh - thanks very much for sharing :)

This tasted awesome, but I gave it 4 stars because it the batter was not easy to spread out in the cake pan.  It seemed like there should have been maybe a little more "wet" ingredient to mix into the dry.  I had to mix a little more than I felt I should.  For the glaze, I ended up using the 1/4 C. plus 1/8 C. more confectioner's sugar because 1/4 was just too watery.

I cut down on the brown and white sugars by 1/3 (we like less sweet) and decreased cooking time by 10 minutes, but other than that followed the recipe.  Turned out very delicious.  Next time I might add a dash of almond extract, and extra Raspberries!

oooo, this is good. Fresh raspberries with almonds is delish, and only 6gm of fat my friends!  I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter and a spash of almond extract to the berries and chopped whole almonds to give more of a crunch. Double if you wish as others suggest; but this fit perfectly in a loaf pan for me.

Great!  I doubled the ingredients and put it in a 9" pan, but did NOT double the egg, butter, or almonds.  Instead, I added 1/2 cup of milk to make it spreadable.  I also used fat-free sour cream, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  I didn't think 1 cup of raspberries was quite enough, so I added another 1/3 cup or so.  The result was a moist, light, and flavorful cake.  No glaze necessary.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had fresh raspberries that I had to use and they were wonderful in this recipe. It was easy to make and not too sweet. I made one for my family and one for a friend and both families loved it. I didn't have sliced almonds so I used slivered and they were delicious. This is a keeper recipe.

Excellent. I made it this morning and love it. I didn't have almonds so I sprinkled pecans on the top. It would be awesome with the almonds also.

Fantastic recipe! I made this right after returning home from picking fresh raspberries and now I wish I had picked more so I could make this recipe more often. I didn't change a thing from the original recipe and it turned out perfect.

My son used this recipe for his culinary 4-H project and took first place in his age bracket.  We followed the advice of others and used almond extract in place of the vanilla, doubled the recipe and added a little milk to the batter.  The judges commented several times about the almond taste.  This was a very tasty recipe and one will keep!

This was DELICIOUS!  I made it with Red Raspberry low fat yogurt and added the 2-3 TBLS of Milk like others suggested.  I doubled the recipe and put it in an 8" spring form pan.  Came out perfect.  I also drizzled Semi-sweet Chocolate over the top after baking.  So yummy and the whole family loved it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is definitely a Winner!!

I made 1 and 1/2 the recipe and used a quiche pan.  I added an extra tablespoon or so of sour cream to improve spreadability. I pushed the batter up the sides to hold the juice in, like a flan.  Did not put the berries right to the edge but sprinkled a bit of sugar on the edges of the batter.   I mixed about 1 teaspoon of cornstarch into my partially thawed frozen berries.  I wanted all the juice for flavour.  I sprinkled generously with the almonds and baked.  Very nice!  Next time I will not double the batter, just the berries.

I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. The cake dough is very sticky so it would have been impossible to spread it in a greased round cake pan (I only had 9" pan so that's what I used). I added bit of almond extract and used frozen raspberries (that's all I had at the time)- I defrosted it for 30sec in microwave as every review said to thaw berries and drain well before using... well, mine became bit mussy and almost compote-like. The end result was still very good. I made a 9" coffee cake and a small 4" (i think) one as well. Overall taste was great. yum. Not too sweet (I omitted the glaze) and very moist. The only reason I didn't give 5 star is because I had to double the recipe to make this cake work. I'll definitely make it again!

I love making breakfast foods. Hope one day to open a bed and breakfast so I tend to try many things with the family. I always make recipie as called for the first time in order to rate it fairly. The batter does look small but it will puff up nicely- just be sure to use the right size pan.  Did look very nice when it came out of oven. Seemed best served warm. Everyone liked it but did not rave about it and beg me to make again. We made with fresh sweet raspberries that we picked at a local farm.

This is a wonderful cake!
I've made a few changes...
Instead of 1 cup of flour, I used half almond flour, and half all-purpose flour. Added half tsp almond extract. Used fresh raspberries. In addition, I baked it in a cupcake pan.

I will make this again! In place of 1 c. white flour, I used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. wh. wheat. Also, I had to use frozen raspberries, which I defrosted in the microwave and then mixed with a little bit of whole wheat flour to absorb any moisture. Very easy recipe for coffeecake.

A wonderful concept. instead of putting raspberries only on top, put an extra cup in the batter. I would have been more please it there were raspberries throughout for more flavoring. I also added 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the batter along with the white sugar. It's more flavorful this way. I used this recipe for a christmas catering function and it was a hit! Thanks!

Lovely is the best word I can think of for this coffeecake, both in appearance and in flavor.  Just the perfect amount of sweetness makes it a sensational cake for breakfast or tea.

This recipe was very, very good. I used about half of the brown sugar, keeping the cake from being too sweet and it worked perfectly! One note--There was not enough batter to make both the top and bottom layer, so I had to double the recipe and make a smaller second cake. But, nonetheless, It was delicious. My best friend will be thrilled for her birthday cake tomorrow!

I made this for a group of ladies and decided not to macerate the berries (less sugar). I also doubled the batter as suggested. It was excellent! I also made the recipe as directed, but found I preferred it without the brown sugar.

delicious. big hit at my playdate! i doubled the batter and baked in a 9" springform. i used yogurt instead of sour cream, because that is all i had on hand. also swapped out the almonds for pecans. i added some smashed raspberries to the glaze which made it a lovely shade of pink. will be making this again and again.

Delicious - loved by everyone.  I didn't have enough batter to spread in the pan and put more on top of the berries, so I just spread all of it in the pan, put the berries on top of that, followed by the almonds.  It turned out wonderfully.  I also used almond extract in the glaze to bring out the almond flavor.  I think this recipe would also work well with blackberries.

I was looking for a coffeecake without a whole cup of butter- this oneturned out great. My only change was that I used 2/3 cup buttermilk instead of the sour cream, and I used lemon extract in the icing. Next time I think I will try cutting the sugar a little bit, as the icing and the brown sugar add plenty. Would definitely recommend.

So good! Thanks!  I have two huge blackberry bushes outside my house so I used blackberries instead of raspberries, and because I always want apples in my coffeecake....I grated up on apple (Braeburn) and I put the apple gratings down on the batter before I put the berries is.  It turned out wonderful!  I also used sweetened plain yogurt instead of sour cream because I had it in my fridge.

It was good, not great. I used frozen raspberries and pecans instead of fresh berries and almonds. It was all i had on hand. I don't think that these changes made a huge difference. Overall, it is pretty good and i will probably make it again if i need to use up some berries before they ruin.

I just made this cake and already there has been two huge slices cut into it and the first words I heard was 'This is good!' Okay,I used blueberries instead,(that's all I had on hand and wanted to use them before they ruined and I used pecans instead also.

I had picked raspberries that day and wanted a recipe that the berries would not be lost in.  This was wonderful.  I used walnuts instead of almonds, as it was what I had on hand.  Can't wait to make again.

This was a great recipe.  I made two of them for company.  On the first one, as per other reviews, I made a double batch of dough and only used 1 cup of raspberries.    I used vanilla extract and left out the almonds (allergies).    The second one I doubled the raspberries along with the dough.  This took 25 more minutes to cook.  So, after 45 minutes, I turned the oven down to 325 to finish baking.  This did dry out the dough a bit more then the first one.   I also used frozen drained raspberries. I also used a 9 inch round pan (cause that is what I own) and when it was done baking, the first one filled it perfectly. The second one was really full, a bit over the edge, and some spilled onto my baking mat.    I used powdered sugar, raspberry extract and heavy cream for a drizzle on top for both.    Both of these got rave reviews.  Only two people noticed the dryness in the second one.    I bet you can substitute any fruit for this.  Yes, I will be making this again!

Like some other reviews suggested - I doubled the recipe too, The only small things I changed was making it using 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract, otherwise I did not alter it in any way.  While the batter was thick it was no problem spreading the bottom layer with an offset spatula.  Then sort of drop blobs onto the top and you will see it more or less cover it.  I did make the powdered sugar glaze adding a little almond extract.  Super yummy

I didn't really care for this, it just didn't suit my personal taste.  It is not sweet at all and very dry. I started checking to see if it was done at 35 mins., it baked for 38 mins., so I don't think I over baked it.  I will keep looking for moister coffee cake recipes.

I made 2 batches of the dough and prepared the cake in a 10 inch springform pan.  Increased the raspberries by about 50% (and brown sugar).  Turned out really well!!!  Next time I may add a bit of almond extract to the dough to make it more almondy (is that a word?)!

My sis and I made this for our mom's birthday, and it was a hit to say the least.  She said it was better than any traditional birthday cake she's ever had!  Omitted the glaze and served it with whipped cream instead... so delicious.

Have made this recipe 3 times - it's a favorite! I definately agree with others to double the recipe for one coffeecake. By accident I didn't double the white sugar the first time I made it, however it turned out great, I still only use 1/3 cup.  The batter is difficult to work with - especially the top layer. I have had pretty good results by simply buttering my hands before working with it.   Very much recommend this recipe overall!!! Thanks :)

This is a great, delicate enjoyable cake. It's moist and tasty, and has a good sweetenes to it. I often found myself out of reach of rasberries, so choped strawberries were a great substitute. The only difficulty was spreading the fruit mixture, since it gets so wet from the sugar, but the effort is worth it all.

This recipe is AMAZING!!  I made this for my sister's bridal shower and everyone loved it!  I tripled the recipe and used a 12-inch heart-shaped pan, and baked it for 55 minutes.  The only addition I made was to add 1/4 cup of milk to the batter as others suggested, and it turned out beautifully.  I also toasted the almonds before adding them to the cake. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Delicious, but definitely double the recipe. I replaced the vanilla with almond extract for a little more interest and skipped the glaze altogether. Used frozen berry mix instead of fresh and it was terrific.

Excellent!  I will repeat what many others have said here - that the batter is difficult to spread over the raspberries.  I doubled the recipe and used enough raspberries to coat the bottom portion of the batter in a thin layer.  I also split the batter closer to 1/2 and 1/2, rather than 2/3 (on the bottom) and 1/3 (on the top) - this seemed to work out well and provided more batter to work with.  An absolutely delicious coffeecake!

the final product was great~ the only confusing thing i came across was that there wasn't enough dough to put on top of the raspberry filling. i was worried it didn't turn out right, but in the end, i was definitely proved wrong.

12.21.15   I baked in an 8" springform pan, and I must say that  I'm used to coffeecakes that bake up with a higher rise.  However,  this little cake does burst with fresh flavor, and has a nice, light texture.  .  In the future, I may bake in two of my smaller individual springform pans for a nicer presentation, but I have no complaints about its taste.

Amazingly good. I did make a few changes, however, as other reviewers suggested. 

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9-inch springform pan. I used 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract in the cake. I also used half cake flour and half AP, and sifted all of the dry ingredients together. I added about 1/4 cup of milk to thin the batter. It was still a bit thick, so I used my fingertips to spread it in the pan and over the berries, which worked well. I added enough almonds to cover the top, more than called for.

For a glaze, I boiled the raspberry juice/brown sugar mixture (leftover after I added the berries to the cake) until the sugar dissolved. After it cooled, I added about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. of milk, a few drops of almond extract, and a pinch of kosher salt. I drizzled it over the top of the coffee cake with a small spoon. It was a pretty red color and the salt cut the sweetness. Even though I doubled the cake batter and filling, I halved the glaze, I hate sickly sweet anything, and the original glaze sounded sickly sweet to me.

Terrific recipe.  After reading the other comments, I adjusted it by doubling the ingredients, using raspberry yogurt instead of sour cream, and by using pecans instead of almonds.  It turned out fantastic and it will definitely be made again.

I've made this at least 5 times now and it turns out perfect every time.  I double the recipe and use 1/2 ww and 1/2 white flour.  I sub baking stevia for the white sugar and chop up 1 cup of whole almonds for the topping.   Great recipe

My mother-in-law loved this cake. Following others' advice, I doubled the recipe and used almond extract instead of vanilla. Would probably add milk to make the batter easier to spread as mentioned, too. This is a great coffeecake--thank you so much.

I doubled the recipe as suggested by many others, and used almond extract instead of vanilla. I also didn't have very many raspberries so I used half raspberries and half strawberries. Next time I'll use all raspberries because the strawberries didn't add enough flavor. I didn't make the glaze but I may try it next time. Even without, though, it's a delicious not-too-sweet small cake. I did not need to add any milk.

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 10 inch spring form pan, it seemed like there wasn't enough batter to spread but after baking the size was perfect. I didn't make the glaze because of pure laziness but I wish I had since my raspberries weren't as sweet as I'd hoped

This was a delicious and lovely cake, moist and not too sweet. The only thing I changed was using almond instead of vanilla extract and low fat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.

This is so delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, but next time would like to double it.  Need to figure out what size pan to use, but definitely need more of it.  Possibly do two 8" pans.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I did however, use frozen raspberries which I drained, as suggested by another viewer, I also doubled the recipe, using almond and vanilla extract for more flavour. My solution to patting down the first layer was to flour my hands, which helped immensely. I used a Pyrex 10" deep dish, lowering the temperature to 325 degrees F, no problem with overflow. 
Reheated a slice in the microwave for a few seconds this morning, it turned out just as tasty. Next time I might add coconut flakes to the raspberry mixture. Can't wait to make it again!

Just made this to take to work - it's not an overly sweet cake.  I had to more than double it to make enough for a 13x9 pan (I set the servings at 25) and that filled the pan well and the cake is approx 2" tall.  It still baked in 40 mins.  I imagine you could substitute nearly any kind of fruit for the berries as long as it's not too heavy/wet.  A nice, basic recipe.

oh this is just delightful. It's a lovely little summer dessert and a great way to take advantage of raspberry season. I prepared it as written, with the exception of doubling the recipe. I see that some other reviewers advised adding a couple tablespoons of milk (I presume this is to make the batter easier to spread) and I will probably try that next time. The batter was a tiny bit thick and so I had to use my fingers to spread it. Other than that, it worked beautifully with a 8.5" springform pan. Will absolutely make this again, it's too pretty not to!

I doubled the recipe as others have suggested and put in a 9" round glass pie plate.  It is in the oven now and is overflowing!  A word of advice to put in a springform pan if you are doubling the recipe.  

I also made this following the recipe exactly and it is delicious but thought the batter wasn't quite enough so that is why I tried doubling it this time.  I think I prefer to make it as the recipe says and if you don't have enough batter to cover the top, it doesn't matter as the raspberried look nice showing through.

I had a high expectation, I guess.  It didn't really impress me at all.  The cake turned out looking beautiful, tasted just okay, my family liked it enough to finish their share but I didn't feel it was significant enough to want to repeat making it again.

Really simple to put together and a wonderful dessert. I used slightly more than a cup of fresh (but frozen by me) raspberries and blackberries, used canola oil in place of butter, used 1/4 cup sugar (as we don't like it too sweet) and baked it in an 8x8 glass dish instead. Did not make the glaze too... we don't like glazes... Turned out just fine! Thank you for a simple but delicious dessert.

This raspberry almond coffee cake will certainly make an appearance again.  For Easter brunch, I searched online for the perfect coffeecake - that's when I found it one.  In the words of my sister-in-law, with this coffeecake, I've totally outdone myself ;)

I love the flavor, I doubled it, and put it in a 8x8 pan, and that is where it went bad, I couldn't cook it long enough, the consistency was still very liquidy after cooking it for 40 mins, then 15 mins at 325, then 7 mins in the microwave at 70%... I also wonder if it had something to do with the fresh raspberries that I hadn't washed until starting the recipe? also I had yogurt instead of sour cream? so I used 1 tsp baking soda along with the 1 cup yogurt I substituted... I will definitely try it again, without doubling... I had followed the recommendations of others, but obviously there were too many other variables.

I love this recipe. My husband doesn't like icky sweet stuff and this was just perfect. I forgot the almonds and I only had frozen berries. I drained them and they worked just fine. I only baked it for 30 min. and it was done but nice and moist. We will use this recipe often. Thank you

I've made this 4 times - triple reciepe for my 11" pan - feeds 8 big boys.  I skip the topping - it doesn't need it.  I toss the raspberries in the brown sugar but only keep the brown sugar that sticks to the berries.  DEAD BUTT EXCELLENT!

Well, I didn’t get to taste this because Hubs took this to his tennis buddies this morning.  When he got home he said, “the guys LOVED your coffee cake!!”  So I guess that means five stars!!  I followed this recipe and didn’t change a thing.  I did however use a different glaze, Vanilla Glaze by Jamie Langston, also from this site.  This made a pretty coffeecake that I will make again, and maybe I’ll get to have some!

This was a great Coffeecake. I wish I would have tried it warm though. It still tasted great at room temperature. I didn't have an 8 inch round cake pan so I used a 9 inch and upped everything in the recipe by 20 percent because the area of a 9 in. is 20% bigger than an 8 in. To do that I used the servings feature and upped it from 10 servings to 12 and it worked wonderfully. The only thing I will do differently next time is not add as much brown sugar to the raspberries. I picked mine fresh from the garden so they were already incredibly sweet, all the sugar did was make them in to a juicey mess. But it still tasted really good.

Yum!  I am eating this for breakfast; a good start to the day!  I doubled the recipe and used yogurt in place of sour cream and halved the butter, substituting the other half with butter buds.    I also used blueberries, since I didn't have any raspberries on hand...I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.

Nice coffee cake - 4 stars for a recipe that needs a little adjusting - needs 1 1/2 amount of batter, swap white sugar (original amount) for the brown (the brown sugar gives the berries a funny taste), and almond extract for the glaze (use original measurements). Very good, nothing amazing, but easy & will probably make again.

This recipe has become our family's favorite treat for Sunday morning breakfast when our raspberries are in season. I have made it for others too and they love it as well. Thanks Melissa

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 10 inch springform pan for a slightly longer baking time. The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup skim milk to the doubled recipe. Very good with the tart raspberries and the sweet glaze.

I used 8" round.  I heaped 2/3 batter in center--spread a bit, placed berry mixture on top of center and used the berries to spread and press out.  Then I placed remaining batter on top and spread slightly with fingers. I also added an extra Tbsp butter and a Tbsp more sour cream.  I only had fresh blueberries, so I used them and they work perfectly!  Only needed to bake for 30 minutes and toothpick was clean. Used almond extract in glaze.  EXCELLENT and very moist.

Wow, this is a yummy combination of flavors! I made minor changes: I always substitute whole wheat pastry flour for white, and because I had no sour cream on hand, I used plain yogurt.  I also followed the lead of other reviewers and and used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I baked it in a shallow loaf pan.  It came out just great, with the texture of muffins and the appearance of coffee cake.  The small amount of glaze was just right, although I think it would have been fine without it. I served it to guests this morning and they said it was their favorite part of the meal.

This recipe was delicious! It tasted like a "Raspberry Buckle with a twist" So yummy. :) I didn't have almonds, so I made a streusel and put that on top. Delicious!

I was looking for something to make with the black berries I had picked and this was just the recipe.  The coffecake is quick and easy to make and taste great.  I added some cinnamon to the batter, substituted white flour for whole wheat flour and put in 1/2 of the butter stated then substituted 1/2 of the butter with applesauce.  The recipe was great and moist, yet with a bit less fat.

The result was excellent and very tasty.  I didn't bother with the glaze.  However, I did have a heck of a time spreading the thick batter into the cake tin.  I finally sprayed a spatula with Pam to spread it out.  Also, after having used 2/3 of the batter, the 1/3 left for the top didn't seem enough.  Otherwise, it baked as stated and was visually pleasing.  It was a big hit.  I will bake it again but will try some of the suggestions of other reviewers.

This was a great recipe.  I used other suggestions and used almond extract instead of vanilla, made 1 1/2 X the amount of batter.  My batter was pretty thick and wouldn't pour so it turned out more like an apple betty texture but it was great.  I made mine in a springform pan and it made an excellent presentation.  Will try again with other berries and use a cream cheese/powdered sugar glaze on it.  Yummy.

Mmmm it was excellent. I made a few changes though. I didn't find it was enough batter so I tripled the recipe to make 2 cakes. I mixed blueberries & raspberries and added a teaspoon of almond extract to enhance the almonds on top. I made it the night before and brought it to work the next day where it was a HUGE hit. I had to forward the recipe to all my co-workers.  Next time I'm going to try using cranberries and instead of almond extract add some lemon juice & zest. I'm thinking it might need extra sugar as well due to the cranberries being so sour.

I decided to make a single batch, since there were only two of us eating it. I had planned on it being breakfast the next morning.. well, my husband had the last piece for breakfast... he had polished the rest off the night before! When I told him I was making it, he just ho-hummed..  not being big on raspberry items (usually :)). Needless to say, I think he has a different take on raspberry items now. I made just as posted, but I did leave off the icing. I had planned on putting it on right before serving, but it went so fast I never got the chance. We liked it so much without it, I don't know that I'll add it.. as yes, it will be a regular in our house now. Thanks for sharing, Melissa!

We really enjoyed this, thank you!  I was positive that I had messed up since the batter was thick and I could hardly cover the bottom of the pan with it.  Nevertheless, once baked the cake looked wonderful!  I would recommend doubling the recipe, we ate the entire thing in a matter of minutes!

The dough has absolutely no flavor.  Center was not cooked all the way, edges were too dense.  I doubled the entire recipe as others had recommended & baked in a 9" spring form pan. Also I had sprinkled cinnamon ontop of the berries prior to topping with the remaining dough.

Maybe I got my hopes up too high on his one but I was dissappointed.  It's not terrible but no one in the family was really thrilled about it.  We ate it but I won't make it again.

This cake was very delicious.  Unfortunately I did not read the other reviews first and didn't double the batter but it was still delicious.  The cake did not cover the raspberries but it still cooked up well.  I am excited next time I see raspberries to make this again but will more dough.

My family likes fresh made coffee cakes on Sunday morning so I am always looking for one that is relatively quick to make yet appealing to coffee cake lovers.  One of the family members is allergic to sour cream.  So I substituted cottage cheese for the sour cream.  I had strawberries on hand so I used strawberries rather than the raspberries.  Everyone raved about this coffee cake.  I will be trying this one again with other fresh fruits!

We liked this recipe. Our raspberries had gone bad, so I used a combination of strawberries and blackberries. It was very good. I was so glad I read the reviews to double the recipe - it would have been so short otherwise. We didn't increase the cooking time at all, and it came out great. For us, the icing is really needed; the cake is not that sweet on its own. Next time I'll try a streusel topping or add a bit of cinnamon for extra flavor.

Raspberries were on sale so I was looking for a way to use them--this was perfect! I doubled the amount of cake batter and it turned out really well. The almonds give it a great touch. I am going to try it with other fresh fruits soon.

Wonderful recipe!!  After reading the reviews, I also doubled it.  I used frozen raspberries, which next time I will thaw and drain, since they added A LOT of liquid (mushy).  In fact, I'm thawing out more berries right now!  Loved it!

I followed others' advice and doubled the recipe except for the eggs, almond and butter.  Also added 2 tablespoons of milk for spreadability.  This cake got rave reviews from everyone on taste and appearance.  Thanks!

Yery Good!  Made this in the early am and took it to work with a couple of strawberry cakes I made last night.  Most people agreed that this was the best one of the three.  Doubled the recipe exactly, added a few more berries and it didn't overflow the 9 inch pan but took 10 minutes more to cook.  Also added one more teaspoon of milk to the glaze.  A definite hit : ).

I sprinkled pearl sugar on top before baking, in addition to almonds. I didn't think this cake kept well.

Rating this 'as is', I made it exactly following recipe.  I would increase the batter as per other reviewers - maybe 2 times the batter and 1.5 times the berry mixture.  The flavour is quite nice, simple like you'd expect from the ingredients...sort of a spongy/light texture, not too much flavour.  A bit like angel food.  Skipped the frosting, it's sweet enough already.  Nothing special but then neither are the ingredients or the effort required!

I've made this now with fresh raspberries, fresh blueberries, fresh pitted tart cherries, and apple slices. Each time I followed the recipe exactly except the apple one - in that I coated the apples in sugar and apple pie spice as if for an apple pie filling, then drizzled with melted cinnamon chips. No matter how I've made it, it's still fantastic.

I was in a rush and had no time to look at the reviews but went ahead and made it based on the 5 star rating.  Big mistake!  I've since read the reviews and as others have noted, would by all means DOUBLE THE RECIPE!  Other than being a bit dry, it was a pretty tasty and light coffeecake.

I liked the cake but found the actual recipe dough very sticky and hard to spread over the raspberry mixture.  I reccomend doubling the recipe to make it easier to work with.

So easy and so delicious! I was looking for a quick dessert to make when my diabetic aunt was over. This was perfect (we left her corner un-iced). She even took the recipe home. The rest of the family raved over it. Next time I will make a bigger batch!

My family really enjoyed this coffeecake.  I was a little bit concerned initially b/c the recipe did not seem to make enough batter, but the results were wonderful.  The cake DID look like a scone (b/c of the small amount of batter, I assume) but it was moist and delicious.

It was OK, not outstanding. I didn’t care for the brown sugar/ raspberry combo, and the batter was a challenge to handle. There is so little glaze produced, it’s hardly worth the effort.

After reading the other reviews I doubled the recipe plus added about 4 TBS of milk. I also doubled the fresh raspberries. It ended up taking over an hour to baker as the top(under the crust ) was gummy. Once it cooled the cake was perfect. I did not add any glaze but will when I make this again.Also,I used almond extract vs vanilla. Really tasty without being overly sweet, A  keeper for sure!

Awesome recipe and can be customized to whatever fruit you like.  Two of us finished it in 24 hours!  I made it with frozen triple berry mix ( raspberries, blackberry, blueberry).  I did not have sour cream so used blueberry Greek yogurt instead.  I did notice the batter was very dry so I added a couple tablespoons of water to make it more manageable/spreadable.  Also mine was done after 20 min.  I used a spring form pan and maybe it was an inch bigger??

Quick, easy simple to make. After reading the reviews that it did not rise very much I baked it in a 6" spring form pan. It did take an extra 10 minutes to finally bake and I am assuming that was because of the pan I used. Thank you for sharing.

We had a bumper crop of raspberries last summer and froze several small bags of them.  This coffee cake was an excellent way to use them.  I doubled the recipe, as some reviewers suggested and other than that, the only change I made was to add a little almond flavoring to the glaze.  I was going to save this for breakfast, but had a slice with my afternoon tea.  A perfect way to spend a snowy February day.

This is amazing! I have not made it YET, but a friend of my brothers made it for their Christmas party last week. I thought I had died and went to heaven!! It was so moist and delicious! She said the only change she made was to use almond extract instead of the vanilla extract. THIS RECIPE is amazing!!

This was wonderful!!!!  I tripled the recipe and put it in a greased and floured 9x13 dish.  I also used frozen raspberries.  I let them thaw in a colander.  There was hardly any juice that dripped off, so I squished them before mixing in the sugar.  And, I felt like this needed a glaze with almond extract, so that is what I did.  This would be equally as good with a vanilla glaze.  So terrific!

This is a great recipe with a few tweaks, I got a lot of compliments! Like others I added some milk to the batter! I also had blackberry fans and not raspberry so I switched the 2 and added some lemon zest to the blackberry/sugar part and I also doubled the batter! Turned out delicious!

Always come back to this recipe. We have tons of blackberry bushes and live near raspberry and blueberry picking so this is always a go to recipe. It freezes nicely too. Delicious. Thanks to the originator of this recipe. Much appreciated!

I too doubled this recipe and baked it in a 9" springform pan.
I toasted my almonds before using to top cake.
Highly recommend!

Very tasty.  I added 2 T of skim milk to the batter, which improved the consistency.  I didn't have sliced almonds, so I food processed some raw unsalted whole almonds and sprinkled them on top.  The cooking process toasted the almonds nicely.  I used fresh raspberries from my garden, and they worked very well.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I cooked the cake in a 1 quart square casserole dish, and this recipe fit perfectly in that.  The recipe makes a nice small-sized cake for my family of four.  We had it for breakfast, and then the kids snacked on it throughout the day.  By the end of the day, it was gone - so no leftovers or 'day-old' cake to get through.  Perfect.

SO GOOD! I didn't double it like some reviews mentioned and it came out great using an 8x2 cake pan. The batter seemed a little dry at first but once I mixed it enough it was okay. The end result was not dry at all! Will definitely make again

DOUBLE THE RECIPE!!  Otherwise this is a wonderful coffee cake.  I am tired of the cinnamon streusel coffee cake and I'm going to give this one a try with pie (sour) cherries. And I will definitely make this one again.

I’ve made this several times, once substituting peaches for raspberries, which was also delicious & a great pairing with the almond flavor. But the dough is too stiff and I always add more sour cream or milk, which creates a better couch, and, ultimately, better texture. People love this and it’s easy to transport to a gathering. It also freezes well.

I made this for the first time yesterday for Christmas Eve breakfast.  It was easy and yummy.  I did double the recipe and had to slightly alter the cook time for a few extra minutes (I think it was about 10).  I started montitoring the doneness at the original cook time and added time in 3 minute increments.  We weren't crazy about the slivered almonds and I will probably switch them out for pecans (a personal preference).  I also used frozen raspberries with no issues.  The cake part was moist and lightly sweet - perfect for a morning pastry.

First time making this, I used yogurt in place of sour cream and almond extract instead of vanilla.
Yes I doubled the recipe and use a spring form pan

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't add almonds because of picky eaters in my family but it would have been even better with it in my opinion. I added raspberry yogurt in leu of half the sour cream when I made it because I had some in the fridge. I also doubled the recipe in order to fill up my pan. Will definitely be making this again!

Sounds like a yummy recipe. I am definitely going to make it with one change. I will use almond extract or raspberry extract instead of vanilla. I don't understand why most raspberry recipes call for vanilla and not almond.

Tasted good but not fabulous. Batter was very thick and difficult to work (also stated by other reviews I believe) I would double it next time as it yielded very thin cake in an 8inch springform.  Loved the burst of sweet fresh fruit in it though.

I did double and baked in a 9" high sided cake pan.  It did not bake completely at 30 minutes so next time (soon) I'll do between 35 and 40 minutes.  I did not glaze.

I've been meaning to review this coffeecake since I made it the first time. It's now a Christmas morning tradition.  Rarely do I make a recipe the first time and not change a few things when I make it again.  This is one recipe that needs no changes except the addition of 2 tbls of milk at the end ... to make it easier to spread.  An 8" springform pan works perfectly but I prefer to double the recipe and use a 9".  I have yet to use fresh raspberries (too pricey).  I have used frozen raspberries each time (thawed and excess juice drained).  Some reviewers claim the cake does not need the icing but I can't imagine it without.  The cake itself is not overly sweet.  We love the crunch of the sliced almonds and the hint of sweetness from the drizzle of icing.  It makes for a lovely combination of texture and flavor ...  and the perfect cake to serve with coffee.  It's a bonus that it is so incredibly simple to make, doesn't require a blender or call for unique and/or expensive ingredients and the finish product looks so impressive.   I literally have the batter ready to spread in my pan in under 10 minutes.  The recipe calls for baking 40 minutes. Check your cake after 35 minutes.  That's when mine is usually done unless I double the recipe.   I typically like to change things up every year and try new recipes ... but after making this cake I have no desire to look for a different recipe.

I made this today for my mother's weekly coffee clutch group. Everyone raved over it and some people had two pieces. I made a couple of substitutions. First I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan, I used walnuts because that's what I had and I used frozen raspberries as well. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream rather than the glaze.

Great cake! Added 1 tsp almond extract o the batter to really bring out the almond flavor. Also I did not have sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt instead. Five stars! It was gone within fifteen minutes of coming out of the oven.

I made this with gluten free flour and no fat Greek yogurt and it was great!  I doubled the recipe  as I was planning on serving it for 12. I also added about 4 tablespoons milk to the batter to just make it a little easier to spread in the pan. I made it in two 7-inch springform pans and increased the bake time by 12 additional min. It was a little tricky to spread the top layer so I simply covered it with small dollops of batter. I didn't get too far out on the edges but the batter rose nicely and filled in with just a little of the berries peeking through. I put 3/4 teaspoon almond extract in the batter along with the vanilla and also in the glaze--gave it a very nice subtle almond to balance with the raspberries. It was a huge success and has hit my list of favorites.

I doubled the recipe, baked in a 9 inch spring form pan and used fresh cranberries instead of raspberries (had them on hand). Otherwise, made as directed. It was awesome! Tart and just enough sweet with the glaze. Highly recommend!

Adding a new edit... Doubled the recipe again using blueberries and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Again, amazing!

I followed the recipe except I added 2-3 tablespoons of milk to the dough so I could work with it. Still it was disappointing in taste to me. Thanks Melissa

12/25/15 - I made this for Christmas brunch. My kids said that I've made this before . . . they may be right, but I've never reviewed it, so here it goes. I used 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract in the glaze instead of vanilla, just for a bit more almond flavor. Other than that I followed the recipe. It's a beautiful coffee cake. I wish I had a 7" or 8" springform pan, just to be able to present it better.  It's a tasty cake, and one that I'd make again.

I've made this yummy coffee cake three times. The first time I made it I wasn't expecting the dough to be so gooey. That would be my only complaint because it's hard to spread. BUT despite that it is delicious! Since writing this I've made it again. This time I used vanilla yogurt because I was out of sour cream. It is the only way I will make it from now on. Batter is smooth as silk. I also added the raspberries to the batter instead of on top. It makes a pretty pink cake and just as tasty. It doesn't even need a glaze it's so good.

I doubled this to use up too-tart raspberries, and baked in two bread pans. I was disappointed in the results. The cake itself turned out fantastically, but the raspberries sank to the bottom, and were a soggy mess. I'll serve it to the family with vanilla ice cream to mask the sogginess. I used part almond extract, part vanilla (yum!). I didn't have sour cream, but had heavy whipping cream to use up, so I made "buttermilk" with that instead. 1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus whipping cream to equal 1 cup (because I doubled the recipe). I've only done this with milk, so I was surprised when it turned into a sour cream like consistency! I also left off the glaze because it was meant for an outdoor potluck, and didn't want it to be overly messy. Good thing I had a backup dessert... I might give this recipe another shot, and drain the raspberries after they macerate in the brown sugar, then coat in flour to prevent sinking...

This was ok, but nothing spectacular. I did have to bake it in an 8 inch square pan as my round ones are larger. Also, I did not have sliced almonds so chopped some whole ones which certainly may affect the topping texture, but not the flavor.

I've been making this cake for over 15 years and it turns out great every time!  I usually double it and put it in a square pyrex dish.  It is so easy and I love how I don't have to use an electric mixer.

This cake is awesome!  I really love it.  It's true that the batter is little compared to the size of the baking dish and the amount of raspberries, but if you work it out, the end product not only look good but also tastes good.  I tend to like chewy cakes, but if you like your cakes to be on the fluffy side, you may want to add more baking powder.  The only thing I would try differently next time is I would mix the brown sugar in the batter mix instead of soaking the raspberries in the brown sugar.

I just baked it, be sure you use a springform pan if you are intrested in presentation!  I had to add a little more sour cream  to make the dough workable.  The cake is wonderful as written, I will make again!   The recipe format stinks you need to separate the steps ie berries and brown sugar, give a couple of spaces so we know its a step in recipe!

This was good, but the texture was a little lacking - it was on the chewy side. This may have been a product of a little too much mixing. Either way I found myself wishing the cake was a little bit richer and creamier.

This was okay...Unfortunately I didn't read the other reviews before I made this cake. In hindsight, I would suggest doubling the batter as it was pretty small and hard to cover the whole pan. Add milk or something as well to thin it out because otherwise it won't spread across the pan. Also, I didn't serve it with the glaze as it was for breakfast, but I'm sure it would be better with it. I'm sure with a few tweaks this would be a great coffee cake!

Made this two days in a row. Doubled the recipe except for the fruit...For the fruit (blueberries), I just used as much as the pan needed, sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon. Used a 9" springform pan. Added one tsp. almond extract to the cake, and a little to the icing. Great recipe.

Yes, I doubled the recipe and the coffeecake turned to be so delightful in a 10 inch (27x3 cm) silicone cake pan! Before baking I sprinkled it with my homemade granola (made mainly from sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, but also hazelnut and walnut)and after baking I glazed it with this easy breezy vanilla glaze. Marvellous with vanilla ice cream! Want to make it next time with cherry filling.

I decided to follow the directions of other reviewers and doubled the recipe. I used a 10 inch springform pan and it was the perfect size. I also used 1 c. each of strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  The mixed berries were delicious! Because I only had 1/2 c. sour cream on hand, I used a 6 oz. container of raspberry cheesecake yogurt along with it.  It worked well.  I took this to a pay day breakfast at school and there wasn't a single crumb left!

Loved this recipe.  Doubled like others and baked in a springform pan.  Even though my raspberries were purchased at the height of the season (but store bought), there were some real sour ones in there, so next time, I plan to either puree or crush the berries when mixing with the sugar.  I can't wait to make again.

This is good and I will make it again but you definitely need to double this recipe because it is not enough to fill the 9 in. round pan. Good coffee cake to have the girls over or take to a potfuck.

The taste was delicious. I didn't have quite enough raspberries so I included blackberries and blueberries. I was generous with the extract and it was great. I did have some difficulty spreading it in the pan, so it was not the prettiest dessert I've made.

If you're using a cake pan DOUBLE the recipe. I just couldn't spread the batter enough to fit, so I used a silicone bread pan and found that worked nicely. Tasted great, I'm going to try it with blueberries next time!

This recipe was super easy and delicious.  Only change I made was using Almond extract instead of vanilla in the batter.  My husband  gave it it a "9 1/2" which is a definate keeper.  Prepared it while making sunday breakfast and served wam right out of the oven.

Absolutely delicious! It took very little time to make and then pop it in the oven. Hubby loves coffee cake and decided we needed to start making this on a regular basis so he can have it with his coffee. Thank you for a great recipe!

Turned out well, followed recipe with a few changes..I used whole wheat flour instead of white.. and the batter was so thick and hard to smooth so i mixed my raspberries in the batter and poured into bunt pan..Excellent. my family loved it!

Delicious!  Made with frozen raspberries and used pecans instead of almonds (didn't have any).  Also doubled the batter as many other reviewers suggested and prepared in a 9 inch springform pan.  Will try again with other various berries.

Excellent recipe.  The first time I found this recipe it was my in cookbook "Guilt Free" cooking.  I have changed the fruit several times, with fresh blueberries, to mixing the raspberries with the blueberries. I haven't tried the chocolate topping though, but I think I will.

it should carry some sort of moisture to the cake, an almond paste added would probably be a good addition, don't know how I'd do this but....it sounds good.

I tripled the recipe and made 2 9-inch cakes, amazing!!! i mixed half sour cream and half low-fat raspberry yogurt and found it to be absolutely amazing. like others have said, I too will toast the almonds before i put them on. it was excellent with just regular almonds, i can only image it will be beyond excellent with toasted ones. i will be making this one again soon!

I've made this several times now, with a variety of summer fruits, alone or in combination (blueberries, nectarines, etc).  I've also varied the nuts (I like pecans too) and added strusel to the topping.  Friends and family, we all love it!

Delicious! Cake disappeared quickly at our potluck brunch. Used 9 inch springform pan. Read many reviews and also doubled the recipe (can't imagine following as is...cake would be tiny!). Though, I would recommend spreading only half the batter on the bottom, as using 2/3 didn't leave me enough to cover the top. Ended up swirling it with the raspberries a bit (but did look pretty, and tasted great). Batter was very thick, and might add more moisture next time. Cake was yummy...will definitely use again!

The coffee cake was delicious, but I didn't care for the glaze - I think next time I might try a chocolate glaze, as someone else on here suggested... I used the single recipe, and squished down my cup of berries - which was too much, but I love raspberries, so it ended up okay.  My biggest problem is, it might all be gone by the time the rest of my family gets home!

I didn't double this because there were only 4 of us to eat it.  No one was really impressed, but I thought it was acceptable and will probably make it again. I will either make more of the sugar glaze, or add more granulated sugar in the cake. I thought it needed more sweetness.

This coffe cake is sooo good and delicious,be aware that the dough is really sticky I had trouble spreading it on the bottom of my spring form pan(that's what I used)and also with the dough that you spread on top so I just droped sponfulls on top and spread it with my fingers as much as I could, I used almond extract instead of vanilla and light sour cream instead of regular.In the end it came out delicious and beautifull.I'll be making it again and again and maybe I'll try different types of berries.Thank you Melissa for sumitting such a delicious recipe.

Very good! I doubled the recipe and used a 8' square pan and it turned out nice. I followed advice from other users and added 4TB milk to batter(add only 2TB if not doubleing).  I'm glad I did, because the batter is really thick.

Followed the recipe exactly but added 1/4 cup heavy cream to thin the batter so it would spread more easily.  Baked for 30 minutes and it was done.  I would follow others' advice and double the batter.  I had a lot of exposed raspberries, but it still came out tasting good.  However, it is not good as leftovers.  It's definitely something you want to eat the same day.

Very good coffee cake! I should have listened to other reviewers in doubling the recipe but I made it as is. I didn't have enough dough to cover the raspberries and make the cake part so I just put it all on the bottom, topped that with the raspberries and topped that with the almonds. It still turned out delicious, I'm eating my second piece as I write this.

This recipe is great! I changed it a little:  mashed the raspberries with brown sugar and added it to the liquid ingredients.  Used pecans instead of almonds and put the batter in cupcake liners.  Did not make the frosting.  Simply served them hot with butter.  Fantastic!!

I took others advice and double the recipe.  Used a spring form 9 in pan, fresh raspberries, alittle more than 2 cups.  I topped with chopped pecans b/c I didn't have almonds and it came out beautifully!!  Everyone loved it, will definately make again!

It didn't bowl me over.  Was good but not fantastic.  I think I would like it with more berries.  This is a little land and not very sweet.  I do agree however that it is much better the second day!!

I made this exactly like the recipe states. The flavor is GREAT! The dough did spread a little thin in the bottom of the pan. It baked out great, but I think it could stand to have more of a bottom layer. If I wanted to make the coffeecake thicker, I think it would be easier to use a slightly smaller pan. Otherwise, I would have given this five stars. I am definately making this one over and over. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good. I doubled the batter recipe and added milk like others had mentioned. I used black raspberries and it was really good. I almost think the coffeecake was better the next day!

This cake is very good...moist and not too sweet.  Doubling the batter was a great idea.  The first time I made it I forgot to put the second layer of batter over the top...this time I reserved the batter and followed the directions but I actually prefered it without the second layer.  Although it didnt rise quite as high, you could see the raspberries and nuts together.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great! I added about 3 tbsp. milk (as recommended) and also added the zest of one small lemon and squeezed some of its juice into the wet ingredients. The subtle lemony flavour worked well with the raspberries. I also doubled the recipe and used frozen raspberries (I didn't thaw them) It turned out fabulous!!
Thanks for the recipe!

It was a very good coffee cake. I omited the topping and just dusted the cake with sugar. It kept well for couple of days. If you like berries, this one is it.

I baked this cake for a brunch, and it was a hit. The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of milk to the batter to make it more spreadible. I didn't have the problem of not having enough batter - The cake puffed up nicely and filled my 8" round baking pan.

I put 2/3 of the batter on the bottom, added the berries, and then spooned the remaining batter over the top. I ddn't completely cover the rasberries. The cake turned out visually beautiful, golden with red berries peaking out. 

My husband wasn't all that happy with the glaze, but he normally isn't a big icing fan. Next time I may make two and sift powdered sugar on one for him.
