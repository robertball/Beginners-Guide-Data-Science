My daughter requested strawberry cupcakes for her birthday so I gave this recipe a try. I looked at two large grocery stores and neither one had strawberry cake mix, so I used a "rainbow" mix instead. I puréed some additional strawberries and added them to the mix in place of water. That was the only change I made. I was able to fill 20 muffin cups with batter and they needed to bake 22-25 minutes before they were done. They were a lot less pink than the one in the photo and the strawberry "filling" was more like a mushy pit in the bottom (maybe because they were baked in a convection oven?) In spite of these things, they were a big hit! I like the addition of lemon zest to the icing and plan to try it with other recipes. One tip: if you always keep a lemon in the freezer, you can grate off whatever you need (for anything) and it lasts forever.

I agree with the other reviewer who said that the filling ended up more like a mushy pit at the bottom. It just didn't seem to work as I expected it to. Next time, I would skip the filling and just add the pureed strawberries to the cake mix to amp up the strawberry flavor. Other than that, the recipe was great. The cupcakes were super moist and I loved the addition of the lemon to the cream cheese frosting. Delicious!

Thank you for the yummy recipe! I am used to baking cupcakes at a little higher temp. I like the results of a lower temp. The tops are flat instead of a rounded dome. These really melt in your mouth and the puree inside is a nice little surprise! Thanks again!

I just added my strawberry puree to the batter for extra strawberry-y cupcakes due to other reviews indicating the puree in the middle made the cupcakes mushy.  I think you could do with about half the amount of puree if you choose to do it this way.  I baked a couple extra minutes, as they seemed very soft.   I also added a little extra lemon juice to the frosting recipe... the result was delish!  I'd call these Strawberry Lemonade cupcakes!!

First time trying this recipe. Worked perfectly and looked pretty.  Wish I could help the other reviewers who said that their purée middles were mushy. Mine turned out exactly as expected - a little surprise of color and flavor. I will be making these again.

Messy but delicious! I made these to the exact recipe instructions and I agree with other reviewers. I would reduce the puree and add to the batter next time for a hopefully more consistent and less mushy cupcake. I found the frosting a little runny - which I have never had a problem with other cream cheese frosting recipes in the past. I would definitely make again with the changes - awesome flavor!

We made a few slight changes, but these were very good. The fruit does fall to the bottom if added to the batter. The secret is to bake them first then cut a small cone shape in the top and spoon in the fruit then replace the little piece. I just used strawberry preserves. The icing was very good. It was not too sweet. It also covers up the hole you cut in the top. My grandchildren loved these.

I came across this recipe when requested to make "strawberry cake" for a friend.  I followed the directions exactly the results were well received.

I didn't read the reviews first, and as I watched them bake, I was a little worried that they wouldn't "close up".  Some did, some didn't.  I waited to frost them until the next morning, being certain that the icing had a chance to firm up first. The cupcakes that didn't fully close up had divits in the top, but filling the hole with frosting disguised the divit very well! After frosting I stored them in the fridge until about 15 minutes before serving. 

The result was a very moist cupcake with most of the puree soaked into the cake.  This left a hollow spot that was somewhat amusing.

I think I will make these again, but might try an all fruit strawberry jam instead of the puree to see if it holds together a little better.

Like many other reviewers, i agree that the puree did end up a mushy pit at the bottom. The cupcakes still tasted great. Instead of 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice in the icing, i used the juice from 1/2 of the lemon and in my opinion it was just the right amount. Next time I plan on mixing the puree into the batter and hopefully they wont be as mushy.

I only made the lemon zest icing for a different cake. It is fantastic. The amount produced in this recipe is enough to cover a double layer cake and have plenty left over for decorations.

Adding the puree to the batter makes a big difference. Moist with a light pudding-ish quality. Highly recommend!

My Granddaughter and I made these for her birthday party today. They were the best tasting homemade cupcakes I’ve ever eaten!
I will definitely incorporate the strawberry purée into the cake mix next time-as the purée did in fact fall to the bottom of every cupcake and actually fell out of the bottom of a few after baking. 
Thanks so very much for a true Keeper recipe!??

I made the purée and put it directly into the batter as suggested. The cupcakes were light and very moist with great strawberry flavor. Not sure if the lemon zest in the batter was worth the time and effort. Would probably leave out next time.

I will note that I only used this recipe for the icing to use on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake and it turns out divine!  The only change that I made was adding more lemon juice (probably the juice of 1/2 of one lemon) because I wanted more of a pronounced lemon taste.

after reading the reviews I added the puree to the mix instead.  I had to cook them for an extra 4 minutes to make sure they cooked thoroughly.   I also added the juice of 1/2 lemon as well as zest to the icing and used only 1 cup of powdered sugar instead of 2.  My family loved them!

Mushy bottoms. Add only strawberries to batter. Increase lemon zest and juice in frosting to your liking. I really need to read comments BEFORE I start a recipe.

Can someone pleasee tell me where I went wrong.. I did everything it said to do but I ended up with a very mushy cupcake inside and a huge pit on the outside!
