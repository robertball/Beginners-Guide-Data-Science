THIS RECIPE MUST HAVE DROPPED DOWN FROM HEAVEN! ABSOLUTELY TOP OF THE LINE! JUST GIVE YOURSELF A BIT MORE TIME TO MAKE THE SALSA THEN WHAT THE RECIPE STATES, OR MAKE SALSA AHEAD. MY THANKS TO THE SUBMITTER OF THIS RECIPE.

Was good.  Especailly the corn salsa.  I like strong spice flavors, the hens could have had double the amount of spices for my taste.  Which is what I will do next time.

I used a regular (4 lb) chicken, and used garlic salt in place of the regular. It had a decent flavor but not as special as I had hoped. However, it had most beautiful, crisp brown skin I've ever managed on a roasted chicken. Didn't make the salsa so I can't comment on that part, but perhaps that's why I found the chicken lacking. Went well over Mexican rice.

This recipe is so delish!  I've done it with game hens and with a whole chicken with delicious results both times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night for dinner, but because I was lacking time and some ingrediants I only made the hens and opted not to make the salsa (even though I really wanted to try it!).  I served the hens with potatoes and sugar snapped peas and the dinner was a hit.  The only problem I ran into was the cook time for me was a good 30mins. longer than the suggested cook time in the recipe, and I only made 2 hens.  But even leaving them in longer didn't dry them out and they still came out tender and moist.  I would also suggest using a roasting rack instead of just sitting them in the pan, because I didn't think the bottom of the chicken was as crisp and flavorful as the top.  I think the roasting rack would have prevented that.  Overall a good recipe and I'll use it again, hopefully with the salsa this time!

I used chicken instead of game hen to make this more budget friendly.  I also cooked it on the rotisserie instead of the oven.  The bird part of this recipe wasn't anything special.  I'd give the corn salsa a 5 for both taste and presentation.  They really should be listed separately.

I adored the hen, and my boyfriend loved the salsa (which I would have given a 4).  I used half a red onion and didn't miss the other half; I didn't have lemon juice so doubled the lime.  Next time, I'll bake the hens breast-side down.  Oh, and I "doubled" the spices by using two hens, per another user's suggestion, and she was right!

Excellent recipe.  I used chicken breasts instead of Game Hens, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The only disappointment was that I didn't have any company to wow!  I plan on making this one many times - and next time I will be inviting some guests!

This was a enjoyable dinner.  The salsa called for a little too much garlic, next time I'll only add 1 clove.  I also enjoy a lot of lime so more of that will be added next time as well.  I did only add 1/2 red onion and that was a perfect amount.  Other than that it was great.  I'll definitely be making it again!

Given that I made this meal for Christmas, the hens were just average and I needed to increase the baking time by 15 minutes as they didn't seem quite done.  However, the corn salsa was absolutely FANTASTIC.  The leftovers were great on plain old corn chips.  By the way, I served homemade corn bread, rice with almonds and cranberries and a fruit salad with this dish.  The fruit salad didn't really go with it but the kids had to have something to eat.

The hens were clearly undercooked per the oven settings on directions. Had to increase cooking time by 20 minutes, and bake on 425.

Family loved and killed the salsa, and requested it again. They describe it as light and refreshing and will make a great side dish for any meat.

Only change I made was to use poblano pepper instead of jalapeno because one guest doesn't like things too hot.  I think it would be delicious either way,  Made with Cornish game hens.

There were only two of us for Thanksgiving, so we tried something different. Very easy to prepare, the salsa is very flavorful and can be made ahead.

This was came out so well and thankfully because my inlaws were coming over for the first meal I hosted for them.  We are a mexican family so the chicken was delicious and together with the salsa(which was perfect and new) it was awesome. Its very good as is and Ive made it a few times since the very first time I tried it and I dont use measurements anymore.  Just kinda eyeball according to your family's taste. I'm sure just for variation, you could try adding pineapple or mango pieces but I havent tried it yet.   Thanks for the recipe

I agree with a lot of other raters who said that the chicken is a bit bland, however, it was cooked perfectly using the time stated in the recipe.  It was very juicy and tender.  The salsa was AMAZING!  My husband loved it and kept eating the leftovers with chips.  I added an extra jalapeno because we like spicy food, and it turned out great.  I will definitely make the salsa again.
