My husband and I both thought these were delicious.  I plan to make these again when my friends come over.

Added salt, pepper and crumbled sausage. Warmed the tortillas in the microwave with wet paper towels. To do over, I think I would leave out the tomato as it didn't really add anything.

My family didn't really care for this when I made it. I followed the recipe to the T. It was just not very flavorful..I think if I would have listened to the other poster about adding sausage it would have been much better.

Loved this recipe!!  So did my 6 year old son.  I made it with mushrooms, onions, green pepper and zucchini.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.

This was pretty good but not something I will make often.  I put a little butter in the pan and used green chili peppers instead of jalapeno.

My roommate and I really liked these whereas my boyfriend passed. Guess he likes his eggs without the tortillas.  Instead of jalapeno pepper, I used 1/2 green & 1/2 red sliced bell pepper. Also, I added a couple of shakes of hot sauce to the eggs.  I couldn't bring myself to add sour cream or guacamole at the end but they were great without it.  The more veggies the better in my opinion but overall, these were a tasty, unique breakfast.
