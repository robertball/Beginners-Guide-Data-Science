This recipe is one I submitted. It didn't occur to me to mention draining the ground beef as I alway use extra-lean which does not need draining. If you use a ground beef with a higher fat content then you will want to drain it. While it is draining, saute the garlic and onions then add the drained ground beef back in. Bon appetit.

This was not bad. It was flavorful and filling and a good budgetwise choice. Next time I will drain the beef after browining it. It was very greasy. I thought it was odd that the recipe didn't say to drain it,but I always follow the recipe the first time I make something. We topped it with sour creme which was good.

I'm afraid this recipe wasn't the greatest one I've tried. I personally didn't like the red wine flavor.  I also didn't think it had a chili flavor at all.  The mixture of seasonings in this recipe results in a confusing flavor that leaves you more puzzled than satisfied.

This was good, but I think it would be better with some modifications. I added in one can of mexican tomatoes as well as some peas and corn and the recipe still lacked the kick I wanted. next time I will try browning the mince in chilli oil to see if that improves the taste.

Thought it was a little bland, but good.  I'll have to play around with the wine (used cab sauv this time) and spices next time.  Will definitely fix again.

Followed recipe and added extra cheese and sour cream just before serving. I think Iâ€™ll mix in the sour cream just before baking the next time I make it. Kids LOVED it!

I wouldn't call this "Chili" Casserole. There's no beans or anything really associated with a Chili Recipe other than the meat and tomato sauce. It was OK but I think next time I'll actually use Chili

I gave this 4 stars, only because it needs a little tweaking.  We thought it was very tasty. Next time I make this and I will.  I will delete the oregano as it tasted more like Italian. 
This is what I changed;  8 oz. of sm pasta shell (cooked) I cut the tomato sauce down to 1-8oz can, 1-8oz can of water and deleted the red wine. I did cook the shells instead of cooking in the casserole this may have not been a good choice as the sauce did not infuse with the shells. Was still very good.
