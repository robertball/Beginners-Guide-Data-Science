You will not believe how good this is.  It can also be cooked in the oven at 350 degrees.

This was very easy. I feel I did not get the full flavor out of this since I cooked it on the bbq over indirect heat.  Don't get me wrong, it was cooked through but just no noticeable flavor.

Mine turned out dry. I had a 5 lb. chicken and prepared it as directed, and used the stand that holds the beer can. I cooked it 2 hours and it was overdone. Maybe I had the grill too hot at 375, but the recipe says to put it on a hot grill. I might make beer can chicken again, but I will cook it a lower temp and make sure to check it with a thermometer way before the 2 hour mark. Couldn't taste any of the seasonings.

ANOTHER great success.  I smoked TWO large chickens using Root Beer.  One was "picked clean" at dinner on Saturday while the other one was deboned and used to make Smoked Chicken Salad with Apples (wife's recipe) for a Salad Sunday meal; Smoked Chicken Salad, Carrot Raisin Salad, Cole Slaw and Deviled Eggs.

We did ours in a smoker. Plus I added rosemary and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also put the oil rub underneath the skin too and left it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours. we are having this again tonight.
