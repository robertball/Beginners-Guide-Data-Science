I made this exactly according to recipe, only folding in one chopped banana and serving with a float of whole milk on top. The kids split this between them. I did not try it myself but they loved it. My oldest boy asked for seconds. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

I made this according to directions, with the exception that I realized as I began to make it that I only had old-fashioned oats rather than steel-cut. So the cooking time was quite a bit shorter. The flavor was very good, really like good rich hot chocolate with oatmeal in it. Very nice, will make it again.

Very tasty and chocolaty. I used a mixture of old fashioned oats, quick-cooking oats, and oat bran, and used half 2 percent and half almond milk. I Also reduced the sugar to about about 3 tablespoons and it was very chocolaty, tasty, and great with a bit of yogurt. It had the perfect consistency after about 5 minutes. Dad and I liked it, my sister needed more sweetener. Great oatmeal!

As is the recipe has way too much coco powder.  I needs maybe a 1/4 cup instead. I will try that next time!

I followed the recipe exactly and did not care for it.  It was not nearly sweet enough for me.  I added some shredded coconut and Splenda, which helped; however, I do not plan to make it again.

I cut the amount of honey to 4 tablespoons, because I don't like things very sweet, and i also added a teaspoon of vanilla to counteract any bitterness. It tasted like chewy hot cocoa.

4 stars for the end result, but 3 for the process. I had to triple the oats and added 1 1/2 cups brown sugar before I was done. Even then it was still lacking something. Will make it again but with even more changes.

I used old fashioned oats and I like my oatmeal chewy so I doubled the oats.  Yummy!

Sorry to say, I'll have to just give this a 3-star "It was OK" rating.
I made it exactly as written, except I cooked it for about 20 minutes, until thickened enough. It turned out to be like a hot, runny chocolate pudding, mixed with steel-cut oats. Not that I don't like both dishes separately, but the combination just seemed a bit weird. I ate it all, for three consecutive breakfasts, but I probably won't be making this again. Just a personal taste thing, I guess.

This was my first experience using steel cut oats. I did have to add more water and cook longer, as the submitter said we might. I'm thinking the honey didn't flavor or sweeten to my personal preference, so I ended up adding a splash of my favorite flavored liquid coffee creamer. I kept trying to figure this recipe out, so with the last few bites, I added a small dollop of Cool Whip and decided this would make a better "healthy" dessert than breakfast.
