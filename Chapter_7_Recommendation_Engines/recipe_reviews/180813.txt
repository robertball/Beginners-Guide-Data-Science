I just made this to on a trial run basis to see if it was good enough for thanksgiving.  It was!  I got dried berried instead of cherries and they worked well!!  I did cut mine too early, and would recommend to wait a while before cutting.  Despite that, it was amazing!

Made this today for a Christmas gathering among friends. I substituted Craisins for the cherries and Walnuts for the pecans but otherwise followed the directions as listed.  It was a huge hit! I will without a doubt make it again and am certain it will become a holiday tradition.

Wow, this was a hit!! I soaked dried cranberries in "Grand Marnier" instead of water and added that to the recipe! So good!

I thought this was wonderful. The video was terrific in walking me through the recipe, and gave helpful hints. I used a holly shaped cookie cutter to make a pretty festive look out of the leftover pastry for the top of the brie.

This was ok. I think I would make it again but cut back on the rosemary. It was a little too strong

I brought this to a Christmas party, it was gone in minutes. The only trouble I had was finding a brie the size it called for. With all the guest at the party it would have been better to have the larger brie.

We made this for Thanksgiving, because it looked so pretty.  Out of 12 people, one loved it and the rest of us did not like it.  I've had a "sweet" baked brie before that I loved, so I'll keep looking for another recipe.

This is such a delicious and beautiful appitizer that was very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, but used a 1/2 package of Dufour brand puff pastry instead. I also used a bigger wheel a brie (about a 19 oz. wheel) and it turned out just great. I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I used a 1/4 teaspoon of crumbled dried rosemary instead. I loved how fancy this looked and how tasty all of the flavors were together. Thanks for the great recipe, even though I didn't use your puff pastry!

One of the best Brie's I have made yet.  I used cranberries though as the dried cherries are out of season right now.

Made this for a party - used the smaller round of brie.  The taste was amazing, the presentation, not so much.  Mine looked messy - my fault completely - but I will definitely make it again and be more careful with the pastry dough so it will look as good as it tastes.

I soaked the cherries in Grand Marnier to soften instead of water - a nice little extra kick to the recipe.

I'm just starting out in the world of cooking and this was a great and super easy appy to make and looks much more difficult (read: impressive) than it actually is. Only modification was using Craisins and next time I might use more honey and rosemary.

Excellent recipe!  I made mine with dried cranberries (softened) and left out the rosemary as I had none on hand.  It was a big hit at the holiday potluck and was gone in no time.  I will make this again and again -- thanks for sharing :)

I've made this a number of times and I've never had left overs. The recipe also works well with dried cranberries. Just limit the amount of fresh rosemary to what the recipe calls for or it will be overpowering.

This was great.  I didn't have dried cherries and was making this for Thanksgiving, so I spread some cranberry sauce over the Brie, it was very nice.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a big hit. The only issue was I only had an 8oz brie and followed the same recipe with a smaller brie - it was great!

Love this recipe.  I used flavored craisins instead of the dried cherries, but it was delicious both the first time and the second.  Definitely the hit of any party!

Delicous and easy! I subst. craisins and pecans instead.  I took this to a Christmas party and if three others had not also brought a baked brie, I think it would have been gone.

Recipe is great. I find if you put it all together  and pop it into the freezer before baking it. The cheese won't melt and the pastry will brown. No more weeping of cheese on the cookie sheet.

added maple syrup  about 1/2 cup, would adjust that amount to 1/3. This recipe is perfect for an appetizer that looks complicated but it's not.

I had a dinner party a couple of months ago and hired  a friend to help out with the cooking.  I put this brie together and had him bake it.  He asked me for the recipe and while that isn't that big of a deal here comes the clencher, he is actually a Le Cordon Blue trained executive chef.  Make this for people and they will think you are the best cook on the planet.

FANTASTIC! I used tawny port to soften the cherries -- microwaved them lightly to hasten the process -- and it was sublime!  Lessons Learned: DO drain the cherries well, and do NOT remove any of the brie's rind.  I removed the top and bottom thinking it would help flavors meld and speed the heating process (I was in a bit of a time crunch).  But without the rind to contain things......a bit messy.

I took this to a dinner party and my friends loved it. You can also make mini portions of this appetizer by putting the cheese & honey mixture inside wonton wrappers or croissants prior to baking.

Loved the combination of flavors--the rosemary is slightly unexpected but goes so well with the other ingredients. **I actually used this recipe to try making smaller, bite-sized appetizers so people wouldn't have to dig into the brie, they could just take their own. Shaping into squares/rectangles doens't work =) the turn into circles anyways..and I added a little decorative piece on top (they ended up looking like boobs, so embarrassing, but everyone laughed). They all REALLY liked the flavors and just the ability to grab one and eat it (ended up being 2-3 bites). It was putzy to do each individual one but a fun twist I put on the recipe, and worth it because people thought it was cool. Forgot to take pictures, unfortunately, but will make again and photograph. =)

I didn't know how many layers of pastry to use so I used the whole thing.  Next time I will halve it.

Took this to a party where everyone brought an appetizer.  This was the first thing gone.  Everyone was raving and requesting the recipe.  Made it just as the recipe calls for and wouldn't change a thing!  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for posting!

My family begs for this every holiday! I use craisins instead of cherries and it's so good we would never try cherries. Make sure you brush some egg along the seam or it may leak a bit - but it still takes great!!!

Absolutely delicious.  I think I will try it with the puff pastry shells and pieces of brie the next time.  The rosemary was a touch of genius with this assortment of flavors.  VERY yummy!  Thanks for posting this recipe!!!!

This is so good.  The only thing I canged based on other reviewers was to soak the dried cherries in Grand marnier.  I can't wait to make this for my next holiday party!  It looks so festive.

I make this recipe every year and just love it!  This year I decorated the top festive leaves with my william sonoma pie crust cutter.  I highly recommend purchasing one!  It looked like a piece of art!  It went quickly as usual and everyone raved...also very usual! :)

I made this for my husband's birthday. I had a total of 9 guests and it all got gone. It was delicious and sooo easy to make. This was my first time and I will definitely be making this for future gatherings. I used dried cranberries, orange marmalade, and pecans. This stuff was AWESOME!!!

Great recipe!  I could have eaten the whole thing by myself!  It's a little sweet but I didn't mind it.  Here are a few changes I made . . . 1. Used an 8 oz brie because that's all I could find. It worked just fine! 2. Didn't use fresh rosemary - the dried stuff worked great! Used 1/2 tsp. 3. Substituted dried cranberries for the cherries 4. Rolled to only a 12 in square and it covered my brie.

I don't care for puff pastry as it's too oily they remind me of cresent rolls from the tube. SO.... I wrapped mine in parchment paper instead and it was awesome!! Served with water crackers, this was a big hit no Christmas night. Not too sweet and nicely balanced. Yummy :)

I made this just a little different - I cut the Brie in half and put the cherrie mixture between the pieces like a filling, then wrapped in the puff pastery.  Everyone loved it.  I have been asked to make several for a friends party so I guess it was a hit.

I used Craisens instead of cherries, and it was a big hit.  I used a smaller wheel of cheese, but still kept the measurements generally the same.  Will make again!

Excellent recipe! This dish came out perfect! I made a few adjustments: I substituded the cherries for dried cranberries, and walnuts instead of pecans. I also added some honey to the finished dish to make it look nice and glossy. I will definitely make this again. Next time with apricot preserves! YUMMY!!

The variety of flavours in this version are superb! I used a 8 oz round brie wheel rather than the larger because it was all I could find at any of the supermarkets. It worked out great! This is a recipe that looks and tastes very elegant, but is actually quite simple to make. The video tutorial was very helpful, as I have never worked with pastry in this way before. Brilliant!

It was very good, but next time I think I'll try it with a more tart fruit.  Perhaps cranberries or tart cherries?  Took it to a holiday party and got rave reviews.  People were awed, and it was so easy.

I used craisins instead of cherries, but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a great tasting and pretty dish to bring to any gathering.

Does not need to sit out for so long, I thought.  We liked to eat it while still warm.  I would let it set only for 10 minutes, tops.  Was so wonderful - huge success!!

Everyone loved this, it was simple to make and VERY delicious! I made it exactly as written, and would probably just add a bit more cherries next time, but it was great as is.

This is the best!  I made two (8 oz brie wheels) and the first one was gone in minutes.  I used pie crust instead of puff pastry (my mistake, I purchase the wrong thing), and it was fine.  I imagine that the puff pastry wouldn't be as heavy, but it was still amazing!   The flavors were wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

This is one of those easy things that looks really complicated when it is finished because it is SO pretty. I watched the videos and used the tip of cutting extra pastry dough into leaf shapes and arranging them on top. I took this to a party and everyone was very impressed and there was nothing left over.

I was surprised to find that this was just OK considering it's rating. I'm a brie lover and thought the idea [in theory] was brilliant. The pecans/honey/cherry mixture didn't really meld due to the thick cheese rind. An expensive appie... but not an absolute keeper.

I made this recipe without the rosemary (I didn't realize I was out). I was in a huge hurry, and didn't seal the puff pastry completely. I also did not brush it with egg before baking. I was very pleased with the results nonetheless! The taste was fantastic! We ate the leftovers thenext day. I'm looking forward to making it properly one day. This is a great recipe.

Perfect just as it is!  I made this for Chrismas Eve and it was a hugh hit. I cut the rosemary by half(personal preference). Perfect appetizer. Be sure to let it sit the hour before cutting into it or it will probably ooze the cheese, but even so it is delicious

This is awesome- I had to make some adjustments due to a time factor, but I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries and used pillsbury pie crust vs the phyllo.  It turned out wonderful and will surely make again and will try using the original ingredients.  Great nonetheless and very impressive looking!

Made this for a Christmas gathering with my family. It was absolutely "to die for". Everyone raved about it. The only small change that I made was substituting dried currants for the cherries. (It was all I could find at the store) It turned out marvelous. Making it again for Easter appetizer and will add a little more rosemary and honey. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Instead of the cherries & rosemary I used Dickinson’s Cranberry Relish. Followed the rest of the recipe and it was great. I used a 16 oz brie too!

This is fantastic! I completely forgot the honey until after the brie was baked, and I'm glad I did, becausse I wouldn't want it to be any sweeter or any different than it was. An impressive, and delicious appetizer. Thanks!

Made it with a round of camembert for Christmas, as there are only Brie wedges to find where I am, also used dried cranberries instead of cherries, but it was really really tasty!

We made this as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit! It was gone very quickly. The round brie cheese that I found was a bit smaller. Next time I will try to get it in the 13oz. size so there is more to go around. Also used cranberries instead of cherries just because it is a personal preference and it was great! Will make this again for sure.

Delicious and beautiful!!  It's a bit heavy to eat but I suppose that all depends on the quality of the brie you use.  I didn't make any changes and wouldn't in the future either

This is my go to when I am asked to bring something to an event. There is never any leftover (much to my dismay) and everyone always loves it!

This was amazing and very easy to create!  I followed the recipe, plus soaked the fruit in Grand Marnier, like someone else suggested.  You definitely need to let it cool and set up, before you cut into it, makes it look so much better.  I will certainly make this again!

Very good and easier than I thought it would be. My husband couldn't get enough and he's not huge on fancy cheese! My 4 year old even ate her whole portion! The only problem I had was my pastry stuck to the cookie sheet- causing a tear in the bottom where honey started to slowly leak out. I might Pam my sheet next time. I think the Rosemary portion was spot on - not over powering (I minced mine very tiny which probably helped). Good with tart apples and crackers - I bet sliced pears would be good too.

Delicious, but really, can you ever go wrong with a baked brie?  This was a heavenly blend of rosemary and fruits, definitely a "make again" recipe.

The honey leaked out, and the pecans I did not roast, but it still tasted fabulous.

It wasn't as hard to make as I thought it would be. And it turned out so delicious. I got so many compliments. Would definitely make again.

Made it with a 7oz Brie from Aldi and with the rind on. Simply delicious! Made a second time to bring to a party and it was gone in less than 10 minutes. I used Presidente brand, removed the rind. The Aldi Brie is simply a superior cheese. Used little chick cookie cutters and fresh rosemary for a "sweep" of feathers. Too cute! This recipe is delicious and a go to for party fare.

I soaked my dried cranberries in brandy & microwaved them for 5-10 seconds to speed up the maceration. I also bought a Brie wedge instead of a round by mistake & it still turned out great. Delicious & easy recipe!

Great recipe, I made this few times already and the last time I put soften cherries, pecans, rosemary and honey in the small food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times to just mix everything together. Best results so far.

This was aMAZing! I limited the amount of rosemary as others wrote it was overpowering, I think I might have used 1/4 tsp of fresh chopped. I also soaked the cherries in hot grand marnier as another reviewer wrote- and maybe did a little extra cherries... Going to make it for every holiday party this year!

Made it twice to the recipe specs...and became the hit of the party!  I was asked to bring "an American appetizer" to a party in Lisbon; considering what my Portuguese friends like, what I can get, what I can make as a novice cook, I gravitated toward this as unusual yet safe.  If it didn't work, who'd know?  Have made it 3 times as it's now requested.  Only deviation has been soaking cherries or cranberries in brandy to deepen the flavor.  A WINNER.

The Brie did not melt and the pepperidge crust was not flaky like we all prefer.

I made this, but without the cherries and it was delicious. I have also made variations of this with oregano, walnuts, basil. This is a versatile recipe
