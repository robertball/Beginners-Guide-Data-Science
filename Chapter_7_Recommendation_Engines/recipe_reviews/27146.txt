This recipe is not for the Novice cook or the impatient cook. If you are looking for a quick, easy recipe, then try one of the fudge recipes using marshmallow creme. With that being said, I decided I was going to step up my fudge game, and try one of the "old fashioned" fudge recipes (which this is). The keys to this recipe are patience, having everything ready before you start, and a candy thermometer (sorry, I don't have a lot of faith in the cold water test). With that being said, this recipe was excellent!!!! If you follow the directions to the "T" (I waited until my candy thermometer registered 240) this recipe will turn out as promised. I did add chopped walnuts to the recipe (I like my fudge with nuts) and the fudge was wonderful, just like grandma used to make. Also, you can't substitute Splenda or any other artificial sweetener - if you're going to do this one, leave the fat/calories intact (and trust me, I'm not the advocate for leaving those intact). Also, if you use a deep saucepan/pot, it will keep the mixture from boiling over. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe! I will definitely make this one again.

DOES NOT MAKE A 9x9 PAN!  The taste is incredible however.  The reason why everybody else's didn't turn out is probably because they didn't have a candy thermometer.  Some people don't realize how handy these are.  Candy is very tricky and requires a lot of patients.  One hint:  after it has reached 240*, don't let it sit for 10 min, beat it immediately following with a mixer just until it is slightly thickening than pour it into the pan.  I added marshmallows into mine.  they just swirled into marble fudge.  they were awesome.  Great recipe!

Easy-on-hand ingredients, and VERY GOOD! Some tips: follow recipe exactly, use whole milk, cook milk/butter/chocolate on med high instead, and use candy thermometer to reach 234 degrees. Also, expect to beat the fudge 6-7 minutes by hand for it to lose its gloss.

This would have been the perfect fudge if I had just stuck to the recipe. DON'T USE SOY OR RICE MILK!!! It would not set but became a gritty yet delicous slop. Chocolate and water DO NOT mix!

Very good fudge recipe. I found that by raising and lowering the gas between 3 and 5 (out of 9 markers )and back again helped to avoid the mixture burning.
Boil and mix for around 5 minutes.

I don't use candy thermometers but if you find the cold water test not working, try just pouring a drop on to a cold work surface. after 1/2 a minute or so it should be softly set. (careful it may be hot.) 
When the mixture is ready to take off the heat you will find that the candy mass has thickened and reduced in quantity.
Another tip is not to beat too long to get the shine out or it will begin to crystalise and taste more grainy. 
Thanks for a good recipe and all your tips.

On my quest for the best fudge recipe I decided to try this one. I am new to candy making so I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible. The one hitch I ran in to was that as I cooked the mixture on medium, the candy thermometer seemed stuck at about 200 degrees. After about 8 minutes I incresed the heat to medium high (number 7 on my stove) and eventually I hit the requested 235 degrees.

The fudge is very tasty and I love the texture, and there is either a nutty or a slightly burnt taste to the fudge... I can't decide which.

My question for any fudge experts out there is this... should I have just waited (and left the stove set at 5) and the temperature would eventually rise to 235 or was I to increase the temperature once the sugar was added and dissolved and hit 235 as quickly as possible.

Great recipe!  All ingredients are basic enough to be found in any kitchen without special trips to the grocery store.  If it doesn't set it's because it wasn't cooked long enough or you missed adding something or measured incorrectly.

Before making old fashioned fudge, you need to be aware of a few things. You need time to make it. Don't like spending much time on something? Try the marshmallow variety. Believe it or not, the actual day you choose to make old time fudge is important too. On a nice clear day with relatively high barometric pressure is actually the most ideal day to make fudge. My family has found that if we tried to make it on a dreary, rainy day, it would never set. Fudge is rather tempermental about the weather.  THe next thing you want to do is always remember to follow directions exactly.  TIP: if your fudge did not set, add 1/4 cup of milk and heat again to firm ball stage.

Delicious, easy, and tastes just like grandma used to make!  All the stirring is worth it -- if you want real, old-fashioned fudge, don't use shortcuts like marshmallow fluff and condensed milk.  And since this is an old-fashioned recipe, definitely use old-fashioned ingredients ... whole milk and real butter are a necessity.  A 9x9 pan does make for some thin fudge here, but considering the amount of sugar, butter and whole milk in this stuff, I wouldn't want it too deep-dish -- a small piece is all it takes to give yourself a sugar rush!  Still, if you like big cubes of fudge instead of small pieces, you may wish to use a smaller pan.  I used about 2/3rds white sugar to 1/3rd brown, just because I didn't have enough white sugar in the house and it was 11pm.  It worked out just fine despite the substitution, and I'm glad that I was able to cut some of the refined sugar out (I prefer brown for most applications).

Although this was an easy recipe to follow and make, I found that the fudge was way too thin and I didn't care for using the unsweetened chocolate squares.  If I were to make this recipe again I would use milk chocolate and put it into a bread pan to make denser pieces of fudge.

My first attempt at this failed. I was afraid to turn up the stove.  Try#2 was a success!  Use whole milk.  I used stove setting of 4 (scale of 1-9) to boil milk.  Boil a FULL minute.  Once sugar is added, stove setting of 5 to 5 and 1/2 is required.  Beat for 6-7 minutes and more if you double it. Use an electric beater to make it easier.  Adding walnuts right before pouring into pan made it even better.

This was my first time making fudge, and this fudge was absolutely delicious, although my roommate said they were a little sweet. So to cut the sweetness, I made some allrecipes peanut butter frosting (posted by Susanne Stull). It complemented the chocolate perfectly, and my roommate now has a new favourite dessert. Thanks so much!

I learned a valuable lesson--baking Splenda and fudge do not a good batch of fudge make!  Guess it's high calorie or no fudge!  Sigh.

This made very yummy hot fudge sauce.  I tried it first with taking the advice of another reviewer and beating the fudge right away to remove the gloss.  The gloss never got removed.  I have a candy thermometer, so I was careful with the temperature.  Not one to give up easily, I tried again but this time let it cool before beating to remove gloss.  Recipe says 10 minutes, but tips for great fudge said to wait until fudge was 110 degrees before mixing - this was a lot longer than 10 minutes to cool.  Tried that and mixed - still glossiness wasn't removed.  All attempts made a very yummy goo.  I think I'll stick with the condensed milk recipes.

I didn't have unsweetened chocolate at home but wanted to try this so I had a 3 oz bar of 70% cocoa and used that and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  This is beautiful fudge and a 9x9 pan is too big but I made do and will double the recipe next time.  thanks for the recipe

I made this fudge yesterday.  It was awesome, the only problem I had with it was that I didn't keep the heat on medium for melting the chocolate, milk and butter together.  It still turned out awesome!  Great recipe.

I am just no good at making fudge........One BIG step that was left out. Make sure you have NO distractions. Between a crying baby and the UPS man. My fudge turned out lousy. It was all my fault. It was looking great and I was beating the gloss out when the UPS man can and I had to talk to him. When I came back it was a dull sugary mess. I tried to smush it together again but that didn't work. I think from now on I will stick to buying my fudge.........I mean it this time.

This fudge isn't your ordinary type of fudge but is VERY delicious!!!My husband ate most of the dish by himself. It didn't even last 24 hours in our home. I added pecans to this recipe and was great!

this recipe is great! the fudge tastes so rich and the few times I have made it I have made a few mistakes and it still turned out delicious! I'm sure if you're entering a fudge-making competition, then you do need to follow the recipe to the letter... but as far as my experience goes, just follow instinct and it works perfectly! Why spend the time making short-cut fudge with unnatural ingredients (marshmallow stuff - ew!) when this is so easy!

this is almost like my great grandmothers recipe, and i didnt have it on hand, so i used this recipe, the only big difference is before you beat the fudge, add a heaping spoon of peanut butter with the vanilla, is doesnt have a really strong peanut butter flavor but it still super good!!

I liked the taste but the fudge turned out grainy even though I followed the directions.  Okay this time I made the fudge and let it cool for  like 45 minutes for it to get to 110 degrees F then I stirred it for 5 minutes maybe a bit too long but this time the fudge consitancy was much better and when I tryed some it melted in my mouth.

I'm not good at fudge and I can ruin a batch of the simplest fudge from the clearest recipe. This one, however, was perfect. Easy, yummy, smooth, and a minimum of ingredients. Yeah, took a while standing over it stirring, but it was worth it.

Not for inexperienced candy-makers. These instructions are not accurate. I heated this to 236-degrees (right between 234-240, as instructed) and the texture was awful. After consulting other sources, I found out that the fudge stage is 240-degrees, not 234-240.  Can't comment on flavor, because my batch had to be throw out.

did not set! was very disappointed. as previous reveiwers said, it probably wasn't hot enough, but it kept boiling over. As i have never been sucessful with fuge, i guess this isn't my thing. Maybe i will invest in a thermometer. Also i found this wasn't very chocolatly. I added twice as much as said, and still, strange looking goop that only faintly tasted of chocolate. Hope everyone else has more sucess than me :)

Didn't care for this fudge.  I was looking for a recipe that made a smaller batch than the marshmellow cream fudge but this isn't it.  Thanks anyway.

This fudge recipe makes the fudge I remember my Grandma making. It turned out soooo yummy.  Will definitely make again.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I had to substitute coconut oil for the butter, and I added half a cup of chopped pecans along with the vanilla, but it came out great. The other reviewers who warned about having dedicated time to mind the pot while it boils were right, but it's worth it.

I've made this recipe many times now, and the flavor is always amazing.  However, mine always comes out with a slightly gritty texture.  Anyone have thoughts as to what I'm doing wrong?  I'm sure it's me and not the recipe, as sometimes it's smoother than others.

great recipe.  First time making fudge, managed without the candy thermometer.  Make sure you have the time to stand at the stove and mix - note that the cooking time is 30 mins.  I was looking for a recipe without marshmallow creme, and this did the trick!  Next time i would double the recipe to fit a 9x9.

This recipe set REALLY fast once I started beating it. It stilled looked glossy to me, but I would recommend as soon as it starts to thicken you pour it into your pan. As far as taste and texture go, they weren't bad. Maybe if I had poured the fudge sooner the texture would have been improved. 

Overall, not bad, but not amazing either.
