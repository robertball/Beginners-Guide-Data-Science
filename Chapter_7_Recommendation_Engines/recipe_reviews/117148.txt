Very good, easy to prepare.  Makes a quick company meal with little time spent in the kitchen.  I marinated my salmon for 2 hours with a coating of maple syrup and then followed the directions as given.  The first time I didn't do that and you couldnt really taste anything on the salmon.

This has quickly become a favorite of mine.  Just a couple of changes I made...
I salt the salmon before I marinate it.  And I cover and bake the salmon a bit longer and slower to really get the flavor soaked in.  Served on a bed of rice with a bit of the sauce from the bottom of the pan tops off my plate.

Tasty, easy, and quick!  I think I would use regular soy sauce (as opposed to the reduced-sodium variety) next time, as both my boyfriend and I ended up adding table salt to the salmon.  Overall it was good and certainly a recipe I'd use again.

I only made the salmon, not the couscous, so my rating applies only to the salmon. I've had problems cooking fish in the past, but this recipe couldn't have been easier and the results were very good. The soy sauce/maple syrup combination is a winner. The only thing that concerned me was the amount of sauce that ran off the fish and pooled in the baking pan, where it subsequently burned; I was worried about having a broiler fire as the fish cooked. Next time I think I'll try poking some holes in the salmon to hold more of the sauce. This will be my first-choice recipe next time I make salmon.

This was excellent!!  I love salmon and actually broiled it in my toaster oven, the timing was perfect so as not to over cook.  If there's anything I hate it's over cooked salmon.  The glaze for the salmon is perfect, not too overpowering.  The couscous is perfect.  I happen to have vegetable broth on hand instead of chicken and it worked out just fine.  Thanks for a wonderful meal.

I give tihs recipe 5 stars because of its simplicity and how the tastes compliment one another to make a meal. My boyfriend thought it was the same recipe I have used for salmon before, but in fact the last time I made a similar dish, the I used honey, pineapple juice, soy sauce, worchestershire, ginger, amongst other things. This cut back to the essentials! I used only the stems of the mushrooms for the couscous and used the tops to fill them with blue cheese and bake next to the fish! Delish!

This was quick and easy, but the mushrooms and couscous side didn't do much for me. I'll make the salmon again, however.

Delicious! It was nice to be able to make a simple glaze with ingredients that I already had on hand for once. I was a little skeptical of the combo of the soy sauce and syrup, but I'm glad I gave it a try. This would be a 5-star recipe based on how easy it was and the way the flavors came together...except I felt like the salmon was missing something, flavor-wise, that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I think I will try tinkering with the glaze recipe in the future to get it more to my liking.

Easy, healthy meal - the salmon was delicious, though the yummy sauce didn't soak all the way through. The couscous was a little bland - boxed couscous would probably be as good if not better. Otherwise a handy little fish recipe for a last-minute meal.

Made both the salmon and couscous for dinner tonight and my boyfriend and I just loved them both.  The couscous goes really well with the sauce on the salmon.  I added a bit of red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick to contrast with the sweet maple syrup and that combo worked well.  Our favorite salmon recipe is the Baked Dijon Salmon from this site, but we're adding this to the rotation because it was so good.

This recipe was not tasty at all. the cous cous was bland. i had to add some salt to it. maybe i'm just used to my couscous having lotsa flavor. the salmon was waaaay to sweet. the glaze is basically teryaki sauce. the inside had no flavor either. i would never make this recipe again. the rest of my family hardly touched it either. 2 thumbs down on this one.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used morels in the couscous and that gave it an extra earthiness.  Also, I did the salmon in the toaster over, baked it for 15 mins and then broiled for 5.  Wow!  Yummy!

Highly recommended!  I left this recipe for my husband to make since I had to work late- he commented on how easy it was.  The flavor was perfect and the couscous (which we almost didn't buy since we had other sides to use in the pantry) paired excellent with the sauce from the salmon.  Our teenage boys had thirds- we wil be making this again!  Thank you Trisha!

Very easy, but like one of the other reviewers, I found it lacking just a little something.  I kept wanting to add salt but that wasn't it, although I definitely felt the couscous needed some.  The couscous was pretty bland by itself, but when mixed up with the salmon and glaze leftover in the pan, it was much better.  On the whole, a good meal, especially considering the quick prep time.

Great recipe!  This is easy, fast and delicious.  The only change I made, out of necessity, was to substitute beef stock for chicken, as I had run out of the latter.  My family loved it!

Wow this was super easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect just as it was. Although I doubled the cous cous, hoping to have leftovers, but we ate it all! Next time I may use thinner fillets, as the glaze is delicious and you get more of it with not so thick fillets (glaze to salmon ratio is better). This was light and fresh and great for summer. Thanks for the recipe!
