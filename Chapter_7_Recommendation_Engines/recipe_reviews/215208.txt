This was a very nice, not too sweet dessert, that went together quickly. The only changes to be made in the future are:  1. More apricots  2. Baked in a tart pan, with removable bottom  3. Oven temp. 375 and check the pie      every 7 min. after 1/2 hour. I used a small knife to test if the apricots were softened.  4. Did not need to glaze afterward.  This was truly a delicious dessert and, perfect if you wish something sweet after a meal, without a lot of heaviness

I do a lot of baking with ground almonds. A hint if you cannot find almond meal: use a coffee grinder to grind blanched almonds.

I love this recipe. It is so easy, but the end result is so special! My fresh apricots came off the tree in our neighbor's yard, and they were small comparitively, so I more than doubled the amount of apricots. Next time, I'll go ahead and triple the amount! It was delicious. I also totally agree (and so does my family) that the melted apricot jam is completely unnecessary, and even interferes with the perfect simplicity of this dessert. I'll be baking another one tonight!

good, but my apricots were too juicy and I had to remove some liquid near the end.  (maybe I will add a little cornstarch to the sugar apricot mixture next time to firm it up.

Easy, especially if you made it more than once.
I made my own almond paste just grounding up almonds in the food processor.

I made a tart.  My neighbor gave me some apricots from her tree.  At first, I tried peeling the apricots using the hot water method, but they were hard anyway, so since I was just making this for myself, I made it with some peeled and some unpeeled.  The tart was ok without peeling the apricots  Yum!  The apricots were great!  I used the apricot jam glaze.  I ate the first slice without the glaze, then glazed it.  The apricots in the jam filled the gaps where there were some, and was not too sweet.  So you can leave the glaze off if you want, but I liked the glaze, and it gave the tart a nice finish.

Loved the recipe.  I use medium apricots and sliced thinner.  The use of a premature crust speeded up the process.

I made this exactly as written  but didn't like the texture of the almond paste using the almond meal it tasted gritty I think I would make my own with ground almonds also I like my desserts  sweeter adding the jam does help with that a little bit..
