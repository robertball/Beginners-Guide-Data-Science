I really like the Chai from Starbucks.  They actually sell the concentrate there (Tazo Brand) for about $5 per carton.  I bought it and liked it, but figured I'd try making it myself.  My first batch was made just as the recipe suggests and to be honest I was NOT impressed.  For my second batch I made these changes.

1) Boil all ingredients (except milk) for 10 minutes
2) Simmer (lid on) for 25-30 minutes
3) remove from heat and let sit for another 30 minutes (lid on)
4) Squeeze any water out of the tea bags and strain the whole mixture.  This leaves you with 1-1.4 cups of concentrate.

In case you didn't notice, I omitted the milk completely.  My end result was a concentrate similar to the Tazo concentrate available at Starbucks, but it actually tasted BETTER in a side-by-side comparison.  It tastes a bit stronger, and sweeter.

Just tried this, and it's very good.  I used fresh ginger, ground cinnamon, and one cardamom pod, FYI.

If you are getting a bitter drink, try leaving out the tea until after the water has boiled, then adding the tea and letting it steep off heat for 3-4 minutes.  Boiling tea brings all the tannins out, and they are terribly bitter.

Next time I will probably add more of all the spices, and add black pepper, since I like my chai robust.  But the recipe is very good as is, and much better than forking over $4 for a box of  concentrate at the store.  (I'm leaving out the milk and keeping the spice/tea/honey mix in the fridge for chai emergencies!)

A quick tip for all those spices that is difficult to strain - tie up all spices, including the ground spices, into a coffee filter and a twist-tie from bread bags;  add the spice bag to the water to boil for a good 20 minutes.   I add orange peel and peppercorns  to my spice bag.     Tea is supposed to be steeped, not boiled, so after the spices are boiled with the water and honey, I turn off the heat and add the tea bags to steep.    After the tea has steeped to my preferred strength, I remove the tea bags.  Then I add the milk and bring to a light simmer and then immediately remove from heat.  ONLY then, do I add vanilla, as vanilla looses a lot of its flavor when boiled.  I've seen this exact recipe on an Indian website several years back.  Still good, though, and as close to what you can find in an actual coffee shop.

Great chai!  A touch of sweetness, but not overly sweet.  A perfect blend of spices!

I love this recipe. It is just what I was looking for. I made it even easier by using store bought Chai tea bags instead of the plain black tea bags.  This way you do not have to add all the spices.  Just add the water, honey, vanilla and milk.  Tastes just like the expensive kind you get at the coffee places.

An excellent recipe!  Takes moderate effort but the results are worth it.  I am not a big fan of the honey flavor and will experiment with sugar next time.  Thanks for the great recipe, though -- now I can avoid Starbucks and make it at home!

LOVE IT !  I follewed SKIDZ7 suggestions, but added 2 cardamon pods instead of the ground.  Strained it with a coffee filter in a hand seive, cooled it and put it in the refrigerator.  When I wanted a mug full, heated my 1 cup of milk and added enough mixture to taste.  Great for a cold day here in Minnesota!  Coffee houses watch out!

I have made this with splenda instead of honey and I also used whole cardamon pods as I had them and soy milk which I love.  Would drink it cold in summer.  Thanks Heather!

Yum yum yum yum I am in love. I added on an extra cinnamon stick and some ground cinnamon, as well as fresh ginger root. Had to omit the cardamom because I didn't have any. Left out the milk because I was planning to use this as a chai concentrate that I can refrigerate for later use. Soo good. Thanks for the recipe.   Also, some advice for optimum enjoyment: FIRST, boil the water, then steep the tea bags REMOVED FROM HEAT for about four minutes. Remove the bags, return to heat, add remaining ingredients, bring that to a boil, and then simmer for at least fifteen minutes. No need to ruin the tea by making it too bitter!

Delicious!  Use as many whole spices as possible as ground ones make a bit of "sludge" at the bottom.  I like to make this in my little crockpot and let it cook on low for a couple of hours.  Tastes so, so good.

I prefer this much more than the coffee shop chai. You can sweeten it to your liking.

I cut this in half for just me. Two servings fit very well in my extra large John Deere coffee mug. I doubled the spices, as I like my chai a little spicier. Very good. NOTE: Now that I make this low-calorie for me, I use either a little warmed fat free half-n-half or fat free evaporated milk and I cut back on the honey just a bit.

This chai recipe is scrumptious!  I also add in a shake of Allspice and a peppercorn and skip the honey to lower the sugar.  Splenda or Vanilla soy milk tastes good to sweeten it.  I like froth, so I separate the milk and put about ½ cup of the milk into my Magic Bullet (it doesn’t work in my blender) and froth it up for 1 minute then nuke it for about 45 seconds.  I make the recipe as called for and then add the amount of milk I want to the top of my cup of tea.  A shake of cinnamon, and I feel like I have the best treat around.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Heather!

AMAZING! It tastes just like the chai tea latte from Starbucks. However I made some changes: firstly, I used only 3 tea bags because I didn't want it to be too strong. I also didn't put honey (never really was too fond of the taste) and put 6 teaspoons of sugar instead. I put 5 pods of cardamom (Mom is Lebanese so we had those lying around the pantry). I also didn't put the nutmeg and chopped up about a teaspoon of fresh ginger. The whole house smelled so aromatic! I still cannot get over how much it tastes like the chai tea latte from Starbucks and I will definitely make over and over again! Thanks!

As someone who drinks a 6 pump, skim, no water, extra hot chai EVERY SINGLE day from Starbucks - this is a great way to save myself $3.73 everyday.  Not quite Starbucks - but actually really close!  Only change that I might make next time is to decrease the water by 1/2. So that it is really strong.  But really - I was shocked.  This is good and I have tried about every recipe out there trying to save cash.  So thanks!!!!  and Yum!

I've tried this recipe twice.  The first time was terrible by my own mistakes.  I failed to "read between the lines" and take the pot off the eye when putting in my ingredients.  The result was a very bitter paper tasting substance.  I also think I used the wrong tea.  The second time I used a different tea and it tastes much better, but is still a little bitter.  (I added just a bit of brown sugar to take off some of the bitter taste).  I have only had Coffeehouse chai (Panera Bread & Starbucks), so perhaps I've never had the real thing.  I wish there was a way to know what I was doing wrong because I think this recipe is great.
__________________
2/26/11 I'm older and wiser now and tried this again today.  SO much better this time around.  I didn't follow the recipe instructions and instead simmered all the ingredients except the milk for five minutes. I then added my tea bags and let it steep for four minutes. Lastly I added the milk and brought it up to a boil.  This resulted in a Chai that was NOT bitter.  We only use skim milk though, so I added some caramel non-dairy creamer to make it thicker and a little sweeter. Perfection!

Just made this, and it is wonderful.  I made a couple of changes, but the basic recipe is great, too - I've made it exactly as written other times before. This time I added a few peppercorns to the boiling water with the cinnamon stick (I use 2 sticks).  I used about 1/4 tsp peppercorns - sounds weird, but it really adds a nice, spicy flavor for those people who want more kick.  You can also grind fresh pepper right into the mixture instead.  Otherwise, I make it exactly as written, and I chill it and serve it over ice.  It's great.

I've been buying Oregon Chai concentrate for years and every time I reach for a $5 per box in the store I grimace, but I've got to have my chai fix every day.  I tried this today and was surprised at how good it was.  Didn't have any cardamom but I will buy some to try on the next batch and I will double the recipe so that it will make about 8 cups of tea. I made this without the milk, simmered the spices & 1/8 cup of honey for about 10 minutes, removed from heat and added the tea bags and let steep for another 5 minutes.  Keep in the fridge and add milk when you make a serving.  Add preferred sweetener if needed.

Love it, love it, love it!  Almost perfect just as written.  The only thing I changed was to not add the tea bags with the honey.  I added them after the milk had come to a boil.  I turned the heat off and steeped them for only 3 minutes.  Otherwise you are releasing too many of the tea's tannins - resulting in a more bitter taste.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Oh my gosh!  I am now a Chai tea addict!  However, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and bought Chai tea by Stash and then I added some Sweet N' Low and the french vanilla cream to keep the calories down a bit.  Besides, I was surprised at how expensive cardamon is!  This tea is so delicious that my ten year old son loves to drink it!  (I'm not sure I really like sharing it with him, it's so yummy!)

Very good, quick and easy.  I don't have any cardamom, though, and I only added one cup of milk instead of two, and didn't add the vanilla until I added the milk.  Also, a sprinkling of pepper, 'though it sounds gross, actually gave the drink what it seemed to be lacking, after tasting it.

I like this well enough, doesn't taste like the chai in India, but is a nice drink for cool days. Very warming to the soul. I leave out the cloves (I don't care for them) and use powdered cinnamon instead of a stick, this lets you pour the chai right from the pot to the cup without straining.

Made this as a concentrate as others did (didn't add honey or milk)- I microwaved a cup of skim milk, added 1/4 to 1/2 of this concentrate and added 1 packet of Splenda as the sweetener.

Leave out the nutmeg, put in black pepper!  I prefer to use a mix of spices I got at the Indian food store - called "Tea Masala" (Laxmi brand). It has lasted me over a year!

This recipe came out great. The milk and tea blended into a beautiful color and made the kitchen smell wonderful. I did add two teaspoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up for my little sisters. Another addition could be a tablespoon of sugar and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to make a chocolate chai. Or a tablespoon of sugar and two tablespoons of coffee granules.
 I had this drink warm but it would be  a great and refreshing summertime drink poured over ice.
 Try this recipe!

I love this chai!!! I'm not a fan of chai at coffee shops. They're usually too sweet and do not taste anything like the chai sold at Indian restaurants. This recipe has all the spices I love in chai--in the right proportions--and you can sweeten as you like. I omitted the honey and substituted the ground ginger with 1/8 cup chopped fresh ginger. It gave the chai a more potent ginger flavor, but it was still good.

Loved it. I am trying to get away from coffee and drink more teas! I have made this several times. I love the honey taste and knowing honey is good for you so feel great about having this as a treat a few times a week. To watch calories I use fat free milk and although not as rich is still good!

Excellent recipe.  I mix extra batches of the spices and splenda (used instead of honey) at the same time to make it easier.  I found that using green tea has a better flavor than the black.  Also, it is really easy to make a double batch of just the tea with the spice/sugar mixture and store in the refrigerator to be added with milk when you are ready for some.  I think it would last for a while that way however I have not had the chance to find out since my husband and I seem to go through it rather fast!

Better than Starbucks Chai to me. I did change a few things. I used chai tea bags instead of black tea. And I didn't have cardamom so I used sprinkles of nutmeg and cinnamon. I loved it. I'll definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe as a great start to a great chai. I don't boil the tea bags. They can burst and can make the chai bitter. The same goes with the  vanilla. Boiled vanilla ruins the delicate vanilla taste and can lead to bitter undertones. So, I follow the advice of SKID27 and let it simmer with the lid on for about 30 minutes, then I add the tea bags and vanilla and (with the lid on) turn off the heat and let it all steep for a good long while. It's up to how strong you like your tea, but I steep mine for about 20-30 minutes more. I pour it all in a mason jar and store it in the fridge (I don't add the milk). Whenever I want chai, I add my favorite milk and enough chai mix to taste. I've made this LOTS and given it as gifts to friends in litle pint-sized mason jars. They have all said that it's the best chai they've ever had.

Very tasty! I love chai tea latte, and, although this was not foamy, it was very good. I like my chai spicy so I doubled the spices and the spice level was perfect. Next time I may go a little easy on the honey because it was a touch too sweet for me.

Just as delicious (and addicting) as my favorite Oregon Chai concentrate!  I figure mine is better though: because it's caffeine free made with organic green rooibos tea, and packed with antioxidants and other healthful benefits if I steep the tea at the end.
Doubling the recipe, I boiled 4 cups water with 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t cardamom, 1/2 t ginger, 1/4 t ground cloves, and 1/4 t nutmeg.  
After 5 minutes I stirred in 1 T green rooibos, 1 t vanilla, and 1/3 c raw honey.
When the tea had steeped 10 minutes (rooibos does not become bitter because it does not have the tannins) I stirred in 4 c raw milk, gently reheated and strained through our metal coffee filter.  Mmmmm!!
The tiny bit we had leftover went into the refrigerator.  It was just as wonderful chilled :)

Used this with Vanilla protein powder and milk. Warmed the milk like I would hot cocoa, mixed powder and added the spices. GREAT way to "drink" a meal. I eat a lot of protein and use shakes when I'm tired of chewing all that meat.

YUM! With this recipe I can alter the sweetness (coffee shops make it too sweet for my taste)- I used less honey than stated. The best thing about making things at home is that I can use more or less sweetener and spices than the recipe calls for, depending on our own preferences. It makes me wonder about people who put fewer stars for this reason alone. I know I like things less sweet, so I just alter it myself. There's no reason to give fewer stars for it. Some things are so simple to alter without putting the whole recipe down. Thanks for sharing this delicious drink! :o)

I've been using this recipe for over 4 years now. It's far superior to anything you can get from Starbucks or the like, and it tastes much closer to what you would get at an Indian restaurant. In fact, I made some for an Indian coworker a while back and he was amazed at how good *and* authentic it tasted. Easy to make, easy to adjust to your tastes. Super recipe.

After many, many brews, let me update this with the most recent version of "my" form of this recipe which still uses SKID27's concentrate base.

I use 4 cups of water, boil, add 5 tea bags (3 regular, 2 decaf), let boil for a minute or two and then remove.  I drop in double the honey, vanilla and then double the called-for spices.  I've upped the cinnamon to four half-size sticks, grinding fresh nutmeg into a tea ball with the other loose spices including 8-10 peppercorns.  I also just recently added 6 allspice berries and 2-3 medium-size pieces of star anise.  I feel the anise really rounds out the whole set of flavors and finished this tea.  If I have ginger in the house, I cut off a quarter-inch chunk of that and throw it in too.  I find it preferable to use whole spices as much as possible to cut down on the inevitable grit in the bottom of the brew when using ground.  This is my final product, I think, and a really good cup of tea.

I made this chai for dinner guests after a spicy meal and it received raves.  It's easy to make and tastes even better than the chai you can get at a coffee shop.  A definite winner!

We love this! We double the recipe, using only 6 tea bags and doubling the spices, including the honey. It tastes better than Starbucks' according to my kids!

This was pretty good.  I was out of ground ginger and I did add a dash of white pepper.  Something different for a freezing, below zero day in New England!

I loved this chai recipe.  It wasn't overly sweet and I made it with skim milk. It ended up tasting absolutely great. Will definitely make it again. The spices were perfect

I'm rating based on the recipe given because I've made it a couple times and the second time was with several additional modifications.
I toast the spices in a saucepan for a few minutes, increase the spice to water ratio, and I boil the spices with water for 15-20 minutes with the spices in a coffee filter. I slightly increased the honey and added it when I pulled the water+spices from the stove. Once dissolved, I added the black tea and steeped for 5 minutes. After removing the tea, I added the vanilla and refrigerated the concentrate. 
When I drink the tea in the morning (I prefer it cold) I toast a little cinnamon in a pan, add a cup of milk and stir for 3 minutes in the pan. I then add it to a cup of ice and top with the concentrate for a delicious iced chai tea! It's a delicious breakfast tea drink. And it's much spicier, which is what I prefer. I use whole cinnamon, cloves, and fresh ginger.

i'm not sure if i've had chai before, but i *have* heard of it.. i was craving a "spicy" tea so i sought this out.. i followed SKIDZ7's alterations, except i added the tea bags at step 3 where it says to turn off the heat, like Christine's method suggests.. also subbed 2 whole cardamon pods per RATHBUN's modification.. i left out the honey (trying to make it low carb) and added sweetener.. only used 1/2 cup of (almond) milk as i wanted something strong/pungent.. ty for the recipe

I used the spice ratio to add to my weekly oatmeal. I simmered the spices for a minute before adding the oats. Added some coconut to change it up. Will use again!!

Thank you!! I love this recipe!! only difference I made was to use Equal in place of sugar, and since it is sweeter I only added what amounted to 1 c. of sugar. don't omit the cloves as one suggested, doesn't taste like a chia tea w/o them!

The tea was a little bland, in my opinion. I added more ginger and cinnamon, but the flavor was not as strong as the chai I'm used to.

Very good.  I actually had the Tazo brand concentrate on my grocery list when I saw this.  I also made it without the milk.  Simmered for 20 minutes, let it steep for another 20, then refrigerate the concentrate.  I made a double batch this time!

Love it!  I add a bit extra of each spice and use 5 (decaf) tea bags for more flavor.  Since I live in the tropics, I need this iced - I add all the spices to the water and bring to a boil.  I simmer w/ the teabags for 5 minutes, then drain and add sugar/honey.  With 6 ice cubes and the cold milk, it's ready!

I followed the suggestions of one of the commenters, SKIDZ7 to create the dairy-free concentrate. I used Celestial Seasoning's Morning Thunder tea and orange blossom honey. To drink, I mixed equal amounts of the tea mixture and milk... I cant believe an entire box of Celestial Seasonings tea cost less than a large chai at Starbucks ... and the homemade version tastes better!  (Would have ranked it a five, but the additional steps suggested by SKIDZ7 are essential!)

Love this recipe - as good as from a coffee shop - and SO easy!! The only change to the recipe that I make is to not add the milk at the end of recipe.  Instead, I take 1/2 cup of the syrup and add frothed milk from my coffee maker.  I store the rest of the syrup in the fridge, and just heat some up when I want it, adding the frothed milk.  Great!

Great chai, the flavors really come together and pop. It has an authentic Indian flavor due to the cardamom, ginger, and cinnamon combination. As others have mentioned, be sure to simmer for 15-20 minutes. I added only a little over 1 cup of milk...else it would have been too diluted of a concentrate. Also beware that the drink can get bitter quickly. Keep tasting while simmering to make sure it is to taste. Other than that, this is a must try- especially on a cold, snowy day!

I've made the recipe as written and it's very good. And, like others, I made it again, following Skidz7's suggestions. It was really good, although a little bitter. The bitterness was easily fixed with the addition of a little more vanilla. I will follow the same suggestions again, with a few changes: do NOT boil the teabags. Add extra bags for stronger tea or just accept that it might be weak, but I've noticed that boiling teabags results in more bitter tea. Also, I won't add the vanilla until the end so the flavour will be more pronounced. I think I prefer the Chai Tea Mix by Jo, but this might be a good one to let sit in the crock pot on a cold day. :) Thanks for sharing, Heather!

This chai is great. I love the Starbucks chai, but it doesn't come in decaf. I used decaf tea bags and added one anise star to the original recipe. YUM! My chai crazy neighbor loved it too.

I love chai tea!  I was introduced to it many years ago because I am not a coffee drinker.  It was that famouse coffee house we all enjoy.  However, I thought theirs was a bit to sweet, so my quest for different chai's started then.  I found I didn't like the mixes and only liked the loose leaf teas because I could control the sweetness.  I used honey instead of the sugar in this recipe.

Easy and delicious recipe for chai.  I used splenda and didn't add the tea bags until I added the milk.  I also doubled the spices.  Will make again.

Very good recipe! I doubled the spices because I like spicier chai, and it was delicious!

I was delighted to find a chai recipie that I actually had all the ingredients for. The chai tastes great. It is not too sweet and can easily be adjusted to taste (although I think it is perfect as is). Thank You!

For me, it's too stong on the tea and too weak on the spicyness.  However, that's all easily remedied.  I just put the tea in at the end after simmering all the spices for 10-15 min.  I also double pretty much all the spices and use whole when possible (fresh ground nutmeg and whole cardamon).  I then keep it in  the fridge and add milk cup by cup.

Tastes exactly like the chai you buy at starbucks.  The only thing I did differently is used soy milk instead of regular milk.  Works just as well.

I'd make it spicier next time, but otherwise it's great.

Great recipe.  It was delicious and made the house smell wonderful.  I like my chai a little sweeter than this so next time I would add a little more sweetner, probably brown sugar like another reviewer suggested.  Other than that, this is a great recipe!

Pretty good! This went well with my afternoon of law books! I accidently put in a little TOO much cardamom- be careful! I also put in more vanilla but that was yummy and sprinkled some extra cinnamon. I used skim milk instread of regular milk and didn't taste too much of a difference.

Mmm, delicious. Next time I make it I'll use a little less cardamon. A quarter teaspoon doesn't sound like much, but the cardamon I used was extremely fresh, and pretty spicy! Thanks, Heather!

Pretty good but I really enjoy Chai and this was just okay. It was missing something but I'm not quite sure what it is.

Very good.  I revised the recipe to make it fewer calories. I used 1/4 of Splenda, 3 cups of water, 1 cup of skim milk.  I would definitely make it again.

WOW...what a wonderful tasting tea Heather.  I love the Chai Tea Mix by Jo, also a 5 star recipe, but didn't have all of the ingredients to make it, so I whipped this up.  I didn't have black tea bags so I used 4 Vanilla Caramel tea bags by Bigelow and left out the powdered ginger.  The honey gave this just the right amount of "sweet" and I would make this again next time I'm craving a delicious hot tea.  Thanks a bunch.
