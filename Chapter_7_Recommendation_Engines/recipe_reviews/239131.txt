Absolutely delish! I used Greek seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

This is very good!  I didn’t have any balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead.  Very flavorful and I only needed 1 T. On my salad!!!

This was a very tangy sauce. My 1 1/2 year old grandson was dipping chicken in it bless him and the looks on his face were priceless but he just kept asking for more and more. Will repeat in the future.

This was a very very good recipe and I am so glad that it's whole 30. Just make sure that you do not go overboard with the mustard- it will ruin it!

Super easy and it tastes good. One day I had it on a salad. The next day I put it on chicken. I double the recipe and keep it in a ball jar
