This is very tasty and refreshing. I think it would be a good recipe for a punch for a bunch too. Taste like a smooth melon margarita on the rocks. I think Jimmy B would approve:) Thanks for sharing witchywoman.

Love the basic taste. Never been keen on Midori so I will have to force myself to try it with a variety of other alcohols. Poor me

Far too much fuss for a single drink. We liked it better when we made a full pitcher. Would have been better if recipe was scaled for 6-10 drinks.
