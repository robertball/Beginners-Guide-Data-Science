First of all, I love cinnamon chips!! I can't imagine how a recipe could ever be bad with them included.  Secondly, my daughter and I had a blast making these and this is a recipe that children can make and you supervise.  Third and most importantly, these were sooo tasty.  I didn't try the sauce but I will next time. They're already gone, which gives me a good reason to make these again soon! Thanks Hershey's!

These are so quick and easy.  I omit the butter and simply roll the chips inside the crescents and bake.  Instead of the glaze we sprinkle them with powdered sugar.  My 5-year-old likes them even better this way.

These would be tastier if the crescent rolls were made from scratch.  I don't care for the refrigerated ones too much.  Cinnamon chips taste great though.  While the crescents are still warm, sprinkle some cinnamon and powdered sugar on top.  Very quick and easy to make!

These were absolutely delicious!! I didn't even use the glaze on top, and they were plenty good without it. Next time, though, I might try mixing in some chopped pecans along with the cinnamon chips. So quick and easy, that's the part I like most. Thanks for the recipe..

Can't rate these highly enough.  Recipe's on the bag of cinnamon chips if you can find them.  I have to buy them at Christmas time and freeze them to use throughout the year.  WELL WORTH IT!!

Absolutely the BEST!!!We make these for breakfast as they taste like cinnamon rolls. We use the basic powered sugar icing instead. Melts in your mouth! A+.. The kids LOVE to help make these! Thanks!

SO tasty and EASY! The kids LOVED it! Some pointers from experience, though:  Leave the second can in the fridge until you’re ready to work with it---dough gets sticky at room temperature and is harder to work with once “thawed”. Before separating dough into triangles, I first unrolled it as one long strip and spread the melted butter across with a pastry brush. (Actually, I skipped the butter the second time I made them and no one missed it). Dough can be separated into triangles by using a pizza cutter (if you don’t want to pull it apart). I, too, ended up with gloppy drizzle and had to spackle it on (killed the presentation), but discovered that the easiest way is to skip the stovetop and just microwave the chips and shortening for 30 - 40 seconds (depending upon your microwave’s wattage), then just stir them together. The consistency is perfect for drizzling with a spoon and the result makes a beautiful presentation (even prettier with powdered sugar lightly sifted on top). And finally, don’t use the bottom rack of the oven---crescent bottoms burn easily (and that was with a parchment-lined cookie sheet even!) ...Enjoy!

This is a super tasty snack that my picky kids love to make AND eat. We had to cut ourselves off from them as we enjoyed them too much! I make them without the glaze.

Wow this recipe is just awesome.  My boyfriend surprised me by making it for breakfast one day, and he was completely surprised at how easy it was.  We could not find cinnamon chips anywhere in Indiana, so we used a combination of butterscotch and chocolate chips - delicious!  I cant wait to try it with cinnamon chips though.  We had to bake longer than the recipe said; the amount specified on the crescent roll can.  To roll, place the 90 degree corner on the bottom right, then put a little pile of chips where the roll is biggest, and roll from right to left.  This recipe would be great for kids and for company.  THANKS!!

These were excellent.. I halved the recipe since it was just for an after-dinner dessert for my family of three. I didn't quite get the cinnamon drizzle sauce right..wasn't thin enough to drizzle or anything.. I basically had to spackle it on top of the croissants... but they still tasted wonderful! Hopefully I'll get the sauce right next time.

While I couldn't get my triangles to line up correctly, I just improvised and made them into a different shape. One kid loved them and plans to eat one for breakfast tomorrow; the other, couldn't stand. My husband had two. I was in the middle on this one -- the best thing is that I had never heard of cinnamon chips before this recipe and I think they are tremendous. Now I need to find another recipe using them.

Great simple recipe to whip up quick after church or on a snowy evening with some hot chocolate.  Powdered sugar icing/drizzle is a must on top.  Best warm.

very good for such a simple recipe.  smelled good cooking too, and my boys loved them as an afternoon snack.  I used reduced fat cresent rolls in a half-hearted attempt to cut some of the fat from this one.

These were good, but tasted a bit too much like biscuits.  I think using a different type of dough would make these taste better.

I made these for a breakfast potluck we had at work and everyone raved about them!  I also made a quick glaze to pour over the top (powdered sugar, milk and a touch of vanilla).  I would definitely recommend this recipe and have already passed it along to several of my coworkers. Excellent!

These are such a hit with my family and friends.  My husband has even taken them into work many times and they have also been requested. These are so delicious and really easy to make.

YUMMY......I did not have cinnamon chips so I used butterscotch chips and everyone absolutely loved them. I also used the bigger crescent dinner rolls which are five big triangles and it was very easy to handle along with the chips.  This is a must have recipe

I learned of this recipe when I worked at a day care. Kids REALLY love it. I went home made it for my kids and they fell in love with it as well. I was very easy to make as well. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Used reduced fat rolls and topped with powdered sugar. Better than some bakery-bought pastries!
