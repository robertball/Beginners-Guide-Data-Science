I've been making this cranberry salad for years. I run the cranberries and the sugar through my food processor for a coarse chop and let it sit for a few hours. I then combine it with the rest of the ingredients. Only things I do different is use chopped and peeled Granny Smith apples and use sour cream mixed with vanilla instead of yogurt. This is good with the French Vanilla Cool Whip, if you can find it.

This is a pretty salad to add to the Christmas dinner table. I made it exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  My cranberries were from the freezer and I chopped them with my Pampered Chef food chopper while they were still frozen--worked really well!  We ate up the leftover salad today; still good, but is best on the day it is made.  You can mix up the cranberries and sugar and refrigerate overnight, if desired, then add remaining ingredients just before serving.  This one's a keeper!

This dish was easy to make, pretty, and people enjoyed it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My sister commented that it "tastes exactly how I would expect it to taste", if that makes any sense. :)  I had never made anything with fresh cranberries before, and I was hoping it wouldn't taste too bitter or sour, so I was pleasantly surprised.

I just made it and love it as an alternative to ambrosia salad.  I sweetened it with stevia in the raw and used just plain greek yogurt.  My new food processor made it a snap and my chopped pieces are really minced.  I also added unsweetened shaved coconut.   Low cal, good source of fiber and protein, too.  YUMMY!

My aunt used to make a salad that tasted similiar to this one, but it was placed in a mold and as a kid I always found it strange and off putting. But I found when just having all the ingredients mixed together, it was truly wonderful when added to the  Thanksgiving dinner menu. I did omit the pecans because of a nut allergy at our table, but I'm sure they would have added a lovely crunch to the salad. I also used Braeburn apples and vanilla Greek yogurt as those items were ones I had on hand and the recipe did not state type. Also increased the marshmallows by a 1/2 cup. Thank you Doris for posting this recipe; it went over extremely well for a non-cranberry sauce eating crowd!

Awesome! Had a bag of cranberries left over and was looking for something to make with it. Ironically I had all ingredients on hand, so I tried it. Family loved it, I only had granny smiths on hand and was worried about how tart this maybe so I did add 1 tablespoon of honey before adding the yogurt&whipped cream mixture. Kids ate it up and asked for seconds. Very delicious and healthy dessert quite refreshing change. Am thinking I it's red color would make this very suitable with a Valentines Day dinner as well.

My family enjoyed this dish.  Next time I might dunk the cranberries in boiling water for a few seconds to get them a little tender.  I skimped on the sugar the first time but next time I think it will help balance the tartness of the cranberries.  Thanks for posting!

I tried this the first time on my family at Christmas.  They all loved it.  It was sweet and tangy, a nice change from the heavy, creamy food at Christmas time.  Will make it again.

Very delicious & pretty! I served this on Xmas. I used my Vidalia Chop Wizard to cut the cranberries & apples. Used walnuts instead of pecans (what I had on hand), fat free yogurt & fat free Cool Whip. This was a little sweet for my liking, I'll try cutting down the sugar next time. Thanks for the recipe.

My grandmother and mother made this for decades and I have my wife make it every year now.  We have this at Thanksgiving and again at Christmas.

You can use almost any fruit that you want such as banana, grapes, oranges, apples, passion fruit, and so on.  Just use 3 or 4 of your favorite fruits so as not to over do it.

We also add small marshmallows and english walnuts.

You want this salad to be both sweet and tart, so dont use too much sugar to remove all the tartness, just keep tasting as you add sugar to get the right tartness for your taste.

I brought this to an Easter lunch, and everyone mentioned how good it was, and I saw them taking second helpings!  Good to bring to a gathering as it makes a large amount. My cranberries were frozen, and I processed them in batches with some of the sugar in my mini-processor. I used a 6-oz container of French vanilla yogurt, but I can see sour cream with vanilla extract working good here, too. It is a sweet and tart combo of flavors and very good. Thanks for this delicious dish which is surely a crowd pleaser!

We loved it, Made it for Thanksgiving Dinner.
We boiled the cranberries and crushed them.
Even though we prepared the apples to avoid turning color they still turned some.  The following day wasn't as good as same day.  
Will make again.

We were feeding a crowd, so I made a double batch of this recipe and we loved it! I actually eliminated the marshmallows due to personal preference and it was still delicious! Thanks so much! This will definitely be a recipe that I make again in the future.

I  loved it and I am not a huge fan of cranberries.  They are usually too sour and bitter for me even when in whipped cream.  I did as recipe directed making it the afternoon before Christmas.  I  mixed all of it up after the berries and sugar sat for three hours.  The next day I stirred in the dressing as directed. No bitter or sour taste. Now I  finally have a great cranberry salad!!

I love this recipe just as written! I have made it during the holidays for the past several years and now have requests for it. I always double the recipe and yet, no left overs.
I freeze my cranberries for a few hours and then use my food processor to chop. It is much better when you allow the sugar to mix with the cranberries over night before finishing.

We loved this recipe.  The sweetened cranberries balanced very nicely with the tartness of Honey Crisp apples, that were used in this salad.  I went to get what I thought was vanilla yogurt and it was strawberry yogurt.  I went ahead and mixed with with the whipped topping, and it worked fine in the salad.  Definitely will be making this one again.  Thank you Doris, for sharing this recipe.  It was served with 'Grandma Earhart's Pepper Pot Casserole' and 'School Lunchroom Cafeteria Rolls' both from AR.

Thought this recipe was perfect.  Added the pecans just before serving.  Not a huge fan of pecans although it tasted just fine.  Wonder how almonds would be...try.

Pleasantly suprised! I honestly didn't know you could eat cranberries raw. I used my Pampered Chef chopper to chop the cranberries and apples fine.  I made this recipe in steps. I made the berries and sugar on Tues (accidentally used 1- 1/2c sugar), added the apples on Wed and mixed the salad together before Thanksgiving dinner on Thur. I did end up straining some of the liquid so it wouldn't turn too pink before adding the cool whip. I don't care for marshmallows but this salad was really good. I used Chobani vanilla yogurt, not too sweet. I was worried that the small amout of leftovers wouldn't save but it was great the next day too. It didn't get watery.
