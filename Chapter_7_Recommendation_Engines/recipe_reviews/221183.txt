This recipe caught my eye in the newly published recipes last week, I just knew by all the ingredients that it was one I wanted to try out. I  bought all the ingredients but didn't realize until I went to make it that I never read the cooking instructions. So here I was the day of serving the meal and had everything in front of me and was determined to make this work. Since I already blew the overnight marinating, I only marinated the shrimp in the juice for a couple hours, and added some extra spices that were called for in the pasta dressing. I just could not bring myself to nuke my shrimp, and thought the overnight marinating might be an important step to that method of cooking. I could have cooked the shrimp on the stove top but my grill lovin husband skewered them and threw them on the gas grill, basting in the marinade. Once the shrimp was cooled down I tossed all the ingredients together except for the avocado and let it sit a couple hours in the fridge to marry. I Added the avocado right before serving. The dressing was good, sort of tangy but went well with the other ingredients. We really did like it and thought it was a great summer nights dinner, of course the hubs said some bacon bits would really take it over the top, him and his bacon. Thanks Mandy!

This is a GREAT recipe! I have to agree with Sherri below that I can not bring myself to microwave shrimp but I know it comes out fine the time we did do it. One other thing you can do to make this a killer seafood pasta is to add bay shrimp to it as well as the shrimp also cut the cherry tomatoes in 1/2 or 1/4  to allow the marinade to get down in the tomatoes as well.

I thought this was good but not outstanding.  I was amazed that the shrimp got really tough after a couple days of refrigeration.  I bought precooked shrimp and simply took off the tails and marinated them.  Anyone know why they got tough?  Maybe the marinade made them tough?

I used frozen cooked cocktail shrimp. I  thawed and drained and then marinated them overnight in the lime juice.  After I cut up the avocados  I dipped them in lime juice just to make sure they did not turn black. I used grape tomatoes and sliced them.  This recipe makes a large salad.  I doubled it for a potluck and had lots of salad.  Everyone loved it.

I used pre-cooked shrimp and marinated the shrimp for a short time in lime juice.  I also sliced the tomatoes so they would blend in a little better.

My family didn't care for this, but I thought it was okay.  Overall, we all thought it was too limey, and the ingredients just didnt seem to mesh well.

easy, simple and great taste! I don't often rate recipes but this was winner even with using what I had on hand which was precooked frozen shrimp and powdered garlic so next time I will take the time to make completely by the recipe! Oh and I used gluten free pasta ;-)

I make this for all family functions. I use cheese tortellini and it is huge hit and very filling but light!  Marinating the shrimp isn’t a necessity and like others, I can’t bring myself to microwave shrimp.

My husband, me and all of our guests loved this recipe. I added about 1/4 cup of additional lime juice to the dressing and 2 tablespoons additional Worchester sauce. Yummy!

I made several changes to this recipe , so you can say I was inspired by it ....   I substituted the avocado for zucchini because this was to be eaten later in the day and I was afraid of the avocado browning. Instead .... I sauteed 2 zucchinis (chopped) in olive oil until they were ever so slightly brown and then added the uncooked shrimp, 1 clove of minced garlic and half the amount of lime juice and cooked until done.   ***  Sorry , to the writer of this recipe but IMHO shrimp is to good and to expensive  to EVER  go into a microwave!!!   I must also add,  that I did not marginate the shrimp in lime juice overnight as per the recipe.   I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it was fantastic!    I can't really say for sure what my rating would be for the original but I was pleased with the end result ... thanks for the inspiration.

Excellent Recipe! Since we're not pasta fans, we ate ours with tortilla chips and while that was super tasty, we're going to eat it on a bed of romaine instead. Also, since I still had some green onion from a previous dinner, we used that instead of purple onion. Next time, we're going to add crabmeat! Looking forward to it! Thanks!!

Great recipe. I changed a few hints based on what I had on hand. I didn't have avocado, dry mustard or cilantro.  I used regular yellow mustard instead and it worked great. I used A dash of parsley flakes and added a chopped bell pepper.  I did not marinate and cooked the shrimp in a frying pan with the juice of half a lime and about a teaspoon of lime zest.  I stuck the shrimp in the freezer for a few minutes to cool while I chopped veggies and it worked great.  The dish turned out a lot better than I expected.  The dressing is delicious and is a great base to work off of.  Light, summery and filling.

Sautéed the shrimp in the lime juice, butter and garlic instead of microwaving. That I poured the sauté in with the dressing. Turned out great! Great recipe!

I only had time to marinate for about 45 min, and served warm. Just fine.
