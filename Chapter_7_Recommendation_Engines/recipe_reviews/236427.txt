I absolutely loved this recipe! The dates and pine nuts with the cauliflower were an amazing combination. I will use this recipe over and over again.

Loved this recipe. Just substituted dried cranberries for the dates since I like them better. Even my guests who don't like cauliflower loved it. Roasting veggies always improves the taste for some reason

So so delicious and simple to make too! Roasting cauliflower is my favorite way to prepare it, but this butter nutty and sweet topping takes it to a whole other level of yum! This would be perfect to serve to guests as it's very impressive. The only thing I suggest is lightly tossing cauliflower with olive oil before roasting.

I brought this to a Church pot luck and it was a big hit.  Easy to make, low calorie (everything else had cheese and or cream of mushroom soup) delicious !! I will be making this again and again.

Super easy to make and was an excellent side at our potluck party. Received a lot of compliments.
