I made it according to the original recipe, but in a 9X13 pan and baked it for about 40 minutes.   I added raisins and apple chunks and doubled the cinnamon and served it to my full house of 8 Christmas morning.  Everyone loved it.  My husband, who doesn't like oatmeal, raved about it and ate the leftovers the next two days.

This makes a perfect filling but healthy breakfast for the week that's not too sweet or too bland. It makes what I would call baked oatmeal squares or bars; "baked oatmeal" makes it sound like the more conventional dish. I've made it twice and haven't veered from the recipe, but next time I think I'll add sliced almonds and Craisins for a bit of crunch and tartness.

I cut this recipe in half and it fit perfectly in an 8-inch round pan.  I'm not sure how the original recipe would fit in an 8-inch square pan.  I also added about 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and raisins, which was wonderful.

I checked at 45 minutes, and the texture was perfect, thickened and tender, but still very moist.  We're watching our cholesterol a little more closely these days, so I substituted Egg BeatersÂ® for the whole eggs, and cut back the brown sugar (personal taste preference).  I find that so many recipes have way too much cinnamon (a powerful spice) overpowering everything, but this oatmeal has a subtle layer of cinnamon which will allow you to mix in whatever other ingredients you like (as suggested by the recipe author).  I topped mine with a spoonful of chunky applesauce, a great partner to the cinnamon.  kjerickson, really enjoyed your recipe, and I'll be making this again.

I just don't know what I might have done wrong, but I don't like this "baked oatmeal".  It is more like a custard with all the milk and eggs.  I added berries and baked it in a larger pan (maybe 8x11), as it never would have fit in an 8X8".  I am accustomed to  cakey or crumbly types of baked oatmeal, but this is a kind of a custard.

I really like this but will make with 1/2-3/4 cup sugar next time..just a little too sweet for me.  Made in 9x13 dish, baked for about an hour.

Fabulous healthy and filling breakfast. My husband loved it. I served it hot out of the oven and then poured milk over it. You can also reheat it and do the same. Fantastic!!
