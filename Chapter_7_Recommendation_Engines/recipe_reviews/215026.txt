Really good recipe.  I used rice wine instead of water, brown sugar instead of white, and I added about a teaspoon of grated fresh ginger.  Instead of adding the garlic and sesame oil at later stages in the recipe, I mixed both with the sauce.  I diced the onion instead of slicing so everything would be the same shape.  I used Lee Kum Kee Garlic Chili Sauce.  It's really chunky and more of a paste than a sauce.  I don't find it that spicy so I added red pepper flakes to the sauce to boost up the heat.  I stir fried the eggplant in two batches using a 14" carbon steel wok, and added about 6 fresh basil leaves to the last batch.  I returned the eggplant and onion back to the wok and then stirred in the sauce and let it cook for a minute or so.  I kept stirring as it cooked to keep it from burning.    I will make this again as it is a tasty and quick recipe for eggplant.

When I originally posted this recepie it called for Thai chili garlic paste (or chili bean sauce) depending on what you can find.  In China I use spicey black bean sauce, and in the U.S. the Thai paste.  Depends on what I have availiable.  I'm not sure why it would ever be too liquid, as I more often have to add extra water rather than thicken it.  I love this recepie and it is a staple in our household.  Fast easy & healthy. Just the way I like them ^_^

I loved this recipe!! I actually didn't have sesame oil but I could see how it would just add more to the flavors.  I also substituted Worcestershire sauce for the oyster sauce.  The flavors were just right with the chili sauce, not too spicy, just the right kick.  Thanks for sharing this recipe I will definitely be making this one again.

This was my first shot at using eggplant as a main dish other than an eggplant parmesan.  This dish was easy, wonderfully flavorful, and filling.  My husband says this is a keeper.  The only 'changes' I made was using fish sauce instead of oyster sauce and a medium-sized Italian eggplant based on what we had on-hand.  This will become a go-to after work dinner or weekend lunch.  Thank you!

Made this exactly following the recipe, but added chicken that I had marinated in garlic and soy sauce and pan seared.  It was super tasty served over jasmine rice.

Ok, so this recipe actually was supposed to be for Spicy Eggplant however, when I cut into my eggplant it was bad (brown all the way through). So, needless to say I had to make a change.
So I replaced the eggplant with firm tofu, and cooked the rest according to directions. I added about 1 teaspoon of grated ginger, and about 8 oz. of edamame to the mix too. I also replaced the chili sauce with chile paste and a squirt of sriracha... turned out delish! :)

I loved this. I find eggplant is best when the texture is almost mushy so I doubled the cooking time and the results were delicious.

This is a phenomenal way to use eggplant.  I used Sriracha because i did not have any Garlic Chili sauce and it add a good amount of spice - also i added ginger and the garlic and sesame oil to the sauce as other reviews did and it's a great flavor blend.  I suggest cooking everything together for much longer, almost 15 minutes, so the eggplant gets really creamy and absorbs all the sauce.  Great, easy, fast recipe!  Oh- i also added oyster mushrooms - great addition!

I made this dish for the first time for a dinner party.  The flavors were fantastic!  The only problem was that I didn't cook the eggplant long enough so it was a bit bitter.  Still, some of my friends (who don't like eggplant) raved about how much they enjoyed it!  I can't wait to make this dish again.

I cooked my eggplant down so it would be soft (that's how I prefer it).  I think tofu would've been a good addition too with a side of long beans.  The sesame oil is essential for flavor.

I'm really not sure how to rate this recipe.  It wasn't bad but just OK.  I did have to thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  The taste didn't improve as leftovers and I threw the rest out--no one wanted it again.

i have made this twice, the first time I doubled the ingredients, it was fantastic, the second time I added firm tofu that I cut in 1inch squares, my husband and nephew ( who are EXTREMELY PICKY EATERS) thought it was chicken, I still have not told them it was tofu, they loved it and asked when I will make it again. It is simple enough to make for a crowd or dinner for two...

tasty! to make it easier, you can just cook the onion and the eggplant in the same pan, then add the sauce ingredients and stir it all together.

This is really good. I wish I had peeled the eggplant because the skin was a little tough. I added more chili garlic sauce because I like things pretty spicy. Also omitted the oyster sauce to make this vegetarian. Will definitely make this again.

Best new recipe in a long time! Would be great with broccoli and/or mushrooms. Don't need the rice if you're going low carb, or try with black or red quinoa on the side for a healthier version.

This was delicious.  I added precooked sausage for the extra protein, and I think next time I would not do that.  It would have been very rich and satisfying without it.

This was very tasty, and I don't even really like eggplant! I did need to make a few replacements though. Worcestershire sauce for the oyster sauce, Sriracha for the chili garlic sauce, and red onion for the onion.

Wow this was awesome!  I halved the recipe.  I used frozen regular eggplant from last year's garden.  Because I halved the recipe, it only called for 1 onion, however I had half an onion and half a green pepper in the fridge to use.  I used that instead!  It was awesome!!!! LOVED THIS!! It wasn't overly spicy either. Just right.  Oh yeah, I never use the skin on the eggplant.  I don't like the skin at all.

I love to order eggplant when I go out and this is a great recipe that I can now make at home.  I followed the instructions making only a few slight modifications - I added in a splash of rice wine vinegar, brown sugar instead of white, a teaspoon of teriyaki sauce and a sprinkle of ginger. Also, I left out the sesame oil and sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on the top.

I served alongside sticky rice, broccoli, and prawns made simply with butter and lemon.

I will certainly make this dish again and found the inclusion of Japanese eggplant versus the standard variety larger headed eggplant to be the key.

This was excellent. I had to make a couple minor substitutions based on the supplies in my pantry. I used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce and sweet chili sauce instead of chili garlic sauce. The eggplant was super stir fried and the sauce was amazing. Thanks.

This was so delicious!  I served it as a side dish at a party, and this dish got all the compliments.  I substituted some items for what I had on hand: grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil, sweet/sour sauce instead of oyster sauce, and low-sodium soy sauce.  My friend suggested I add bell pepper and pineapple chunks next time.

This was very good when served over rice.  I chopped some fresh tomato and sprinkled it over the top as a garnish.  It added a nice texture contrast.

Made this tonight; followed the recipe exactly except added canned chicken breast (I know, it sounds gross, but it was on hand!). Delicious -- a keeper.

This recipe was really good. I cut the ingredients in half since I was only cooking for myself. One thing I did change though was I added shrimp when I was cooking the onions and it worked out really well!

Tasty.  We doubled the sauce & garlic, added extra chili garlic sauce, thai chili peppers, red pepper flakes (we like things spicy), diced ginger and mushrooms.  Used 1/2 fish sauce and 1/2 worchester as we didn't have oyster sauce.

We loved it! I added Szechuan Spicy Stir-Fry Sauce for more spice. A bit of prep work but cooks up fast which made it a perfect recipe to do with my teen girls.

I don't usually like eggplant but really enjoyed this. Didn't have chili garlic sauce and used a dash of cayenne peppar instead. Doubled amount of sauce as well.

Very delicious. I followed the recipe pretty closely only I didn't have the chili garlic sauce which I'm sure would have given it even more of a kick. Instead I added some cayenne and cumin and man this dish is delish!

Lovely tasty recipe.  I used Asian Chili sauce and doubled the amount (we like spicy)  This is a do again recipe for sure.

Excellent eggplant recipe!  Definitely a pleaser.  Don't forget the sesame seed oil though!  I initially forgot it, and it really makes the flavor!

Excellent dish. I added some diced Greek sausage to this meal which added extra flavor, but I think it would go equally well without the sausage.

This was really good! To cut down on the fat, I used olive oil spray to sauté the eggplant and onions. I also used 1 tsp of the chili paste, as 1 tbsp would have been way too spicy for me. I added cubed Trader Joe's baked siracha tofu and served the mixture over zucchini noodles. Filling and flavorful!

I was looking for a way to use eggplant because my wife enjoys it. I thought the stir-fry was an interesting recipe. I added shiitake to give it that meaty texture. I sprinkled some roasted sesame seeds and green onion over final presentation before serving.

I just made this recipe; I was looking for something new and tasty to do with eggplant. The smell before it was done was amazing. I used white wine in place of water, fish oil instead of oyster sauce and didn't have any chili garlic sauce on hand. I added red pepper flakes to taste and served with seasoned rice. Very tasty, will definitely do this again.

LOVED IT!!!  I have been looking for this recipe. This recipe is really good, almost a perfect copy-cat of my favorite dish from PF Chang's.  I wish it made more sauce though for the rice.  Next time I will triple the ingredients for the sauce except for the chili sauce.

Just loved this recipe.  I added sweet chili sauce and used hot chili sesame oil and I added it in with the rest of the sauce ingredients and simmered it all together.  We will definitely be having this dish again and again.  Next time I will add a nice rice noodle.

This was a little bland and anything I did to make it better made it greasy or spicier.  I've never used oyster sauce before, and I can't say I would again. In the end it was edible but I wouldn't make it again.  I enjoyed cooking eggplant for the first time, it really shrinks.  The recipe is pretty simple to follow and not especially difficult to make, just I didn't care for the flavor.  I also thought sugar was a strange thing to add in something that is mainly a stir fry.

This was great! I omnitted the otster sauce since my daughter has a seafood allergy, but everything else was the same. I spread it over pizza dough and sprinkled it with cheese (although it really didn't need it) and baked it. My husband and all 5 kids - from my 21 yo daughter down to my 6 yo - absolutely LOVED it (and most of them hate eggplant). They were crushed the next day to find there were no leftovers. Thanks venymae!

I finally bought japanese eggplant and wanted to make Basil Eggplant that I get at our favorite Thai restaurant. I decided to use this recipe and add basil.  Recipe is outstanding! Don't be tempted to overcook the eggplant in the beginning. I mixed all of the sauce ingredients in a little bowl and added all at one time to the pan, increasing the sugar to 2 tsps instead of 1. Added chopped basil (3-4 TBS of chopped) at the end.  

 It is the very first time I cooked a sauce in a recipe that actually tasted like a sauce in a restaurant.  

Definitely a keeper for us.  Next time I'm going to add chicken or shrimp...or both.  Served with white and brown rice (choices) and sugar snap peas.

Absolutely delicious!  I'm not a huge eggplant fan, but I loved this.  I added diced red peppers when I added the eggplant to the sauce mixture and fresh diced amaranth leaves (taste is very similar to spinach) and thai basil when I added the sesame oil to make the dish a little more aesthetically pleasing and because they were all ready in the garden along with the eggplants.

I thought that this was okay.  It's very flavorful, but in my opinion, it was too flavorful.  The eggplant was overrun with added flavor and you kind of lost the actual taste of eggplant.

We loved this, even my husband who does not do a lot of spice.  I left out the onions and upped the quantities of everything else slightly to make more sauce.  I served it as a side with BBQed steak.  Great Flavor!

Great recipe!  I added mushrooms, red pepper strips and cherry tomatoes.  Used everything but oyster sauce to keep vegetarian.  Served over ramen noodles (without seasoning packet).  I used Rosa Bianca eggplant from Farmers' Market.  It has a wonderfully firm texture and not watery as regular eggplant can be.  Can't wait to have again.

Good basic recipe.  Too salty for our tastes.  Cut back on the oyster sauce - 2t. and added at least a cup of chicken broth at the simmering stage.  Also added 1/2 lb. of ground pork after cooking the onions and garlic together.  Turned out yummy.

Loved this recipe. I only had one eggplant on hand so added zucchini and red bell pepper. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe for a side dish. I'll likely use it again. I used Worcestershire sauce vs. oyster sauce, and 1 onion and 1 sweet bell pepper for some hardiness. sriracha sauce made a nice sub for the chili sauce, as well.

I love this recipe!!! I modify it a bit every time depending on what Ingredients I have on hand. I omit the sugar and instead of oyster sauce, I use a dash of fish sauce and add a table spoon of rice cooking wine. I add some of the minced garlic into the sauce as well as sauté some of it (about 1/3 in sauce.) I use a tbsp of Sambal Oelek chili paste and about a tsp of sriracha sauce. I chop the onion smallish instead of leaving it sliced, I think it goes better that way with the texture. I also cook the eggplant for about 8-10 minutes first before removing it from pan to cook the onion etc. Super easy recipe and easy to customize to your liking, I make it all the time!

I really liked this, it was fast and versatile! I used 2 small regular eggplant, didn't have oyster sauce, subbed fish sauce. I know they aren't similar but it still turned out very good! I didn't peel the eggplant. Will definitely make again!

Frankly disappointed in this.  Most of the flavor was absorbed by the onions, leaving the eggplant itself rather bland.  Something to thicken the sauce and coat the eggplant might help.

This is so good!  I wanted a quick recipe to use up all my eggplant and this one does not disappoint. I followed the recipe except for the oyster sauce, only because I did not want to run out and get some. I substituted Worchester sauce instead of the oyster sauce as someone suggested and it came out super tasty; I didn’t miss the oyster sauce at all. I added chili flakes at the end. This was a huge hit in my family.  The second time I made it I added mushrooms and it also tasted great.

Awesome! Definitely part of the regular rotation. Omit the jalapeño for a more mild sauce. I always add extra vegetables and sometimes chicken.

I just didn't add the onion, but this was delicious! I like a little more heat so I added some crushed red pepper flakes; maybe some Siracha would have worked well here, too. Added a splash of rice wine vinegar. I like a dish like this to be more mushy, so I cooked it about twice the amount of time. Very good recipe!

I love spicey eggplant at Asian restaurant and this is my first try at homemade, this is awesome!!! In my grocery store I didn’t find oyster sauce, but I did find a sweet chili Thai sauce so I substituted the sweet chili sauce for chili paste, oyster sauce and sugar. It was sooo tasty, crave-able.

I substituted a medium eggplant because it's what I had on hand. I made it as written except I discovered I didn't have any oyster or fish sauce in the house.  We enjoyed it and it was easy and everyone liked it.

In a hurry, I had left out the sesame seed oil, so it tasted rather bland. When I finally added it, it tasted much better. I will make it again, being more careful to follow the recipe exactly!

Really delicious and an excellent base recipe for tweaking to suit your tastes.  I skipped the sugar entirely and used half canola  oil/half sesame oil to cook.  Will add mushrooms, peppers and chicken next time!

I did like this recipe, although it isn't as delicious as the eggplant dishes I had while living in China! Nonetheless, I will make it again, with perhaps a little less oyster sauce (personal preference) and more sauce overall. I didn't make a full recipe as I used one regular eggplant and didn't think I would need as much. I also left out the sugar completely and didn't miss it at all.

I didn't go exactly by the recipe (eyeballed the measurements) and it still came out tasting delicious. I would highly recommend making this, but not adding salt to this dish though. I added salt after I was half way through the plate and it made the eggplant taste horrid.

Made this as a side and then had double portion for my lunch next day.  Sauce is really good, spicy and is one that could be used with other meats/vegetables.  Great way to eat eggplant!

Really, really good!  We used Italian eggplant, and sriracha sauce for the garlic chili sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe closely.  For us, it made only two servings!

Great flavor as written.  I have also substituted cubed tofu for the eggplant when I didn't have eggplant because I like the flavor of the dish.  I browned the tofu & then added towards the end.

Cut the recipe in half, as I had half an eggplant.  Didn't quite adjust properly, and result, though tasty, was very oily.  Will try again.

Fabulous main dish with chicken. Not too spicy. Used Worcestershire sauce instead of oyster, added tsp fresh ginger, cooked it longer to soften the eggplant, added the sesame oil in with the sauce ingredients. Delicious and we both had seconds!

Really good! I am the only eggplant lover in my home, so I always trycout new recipes. I made it per the directions and liked it, I just added a little more chili powder (I love spicy foods) and a pinch of salt and fell in love. I will be doing this again!

Delicious sauce and flavors!  I followed the most helpful positive review and substituted rice wine for water and brown sugar for white sugar.  Also, added 1 lb. of boneless chicken breast, diced and pre-cooked.  It was a great meal with basmati rice!

Great recipe. I used two regular eggplants because they were half the price per pound compared to the Asian kind, and that seemed to be the right amount for the recipe. I also used sweet chili sauce instead of hot chili sauce, because that is what I had and also I don't like things really spicy. I left out the sugar since I was already adding sweet. Turned out great! Make sure you cook the eggplant until it is really soft.

I had to cut the recipe for 2 people but it was absolutely delicious! Over the rice was filling, my daughter and I are getting into vegan recipes we want to eat healthier so our meals will have meat maybe just once or twice per week. Keep those great vegetable recipes coming.

Excellent, easy stir-fry dish! I made it my own with ingredients I had on hand (i.e. didn't have oyster sauce, used Sriracha instead of chili garlic sauce). Added in zucchini for variety. My pan was getting dry towards the end, so I added in a few splashes of water so the veggies could soften a bit longer.

I really enjoy this recipe. Definitley no need for additional salt, 2 tablespoon reduced salt soy sauce is still salty for me. I added small amount pork for protein, replaced chilly garlic sauce with 1 tablespoon minced garlic. Good taste still.
I would suggest to add finely chopped green onion on final dish for more appealing performance.

We rarely eat eggplant, so I was looking for a recipe that would be different than the standard "breaded/tomato sauce/parmesan" routine.  

I took the advice of another reader and swapped out the water and white sugar for rice wine vinegar and brown sugar.  I also did not have any oyster sauce on hand - fresh out if you believe it - so I used Thai red curry paste instead.  To add some color, I threw in some sliced carrot and green pepper.  

Instead of serving it over rice, I served it over quinoa that had been toasted prior to being cooked.

This was a pretty darned good dish!  I'd say, even better the next day.  I have saved the recipe and will be making it again.  Four stars well deserved!

I made this the night before and served it with rice for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. I used hot pepper sauce because I didn't have garlic chili sauce. The taste was amazing, and everyone loved it. This one is definitely a keeper.

It was okay. I added peanuts at the end for the topping.  Nice crunch affect and went well with the asian flavors.  I also ground a thumb of ginger and threw that in.

My daughters and I really enjoyed this. I added some of the extra ingredients like ginger, diced onions, Sriracha hot chili sauce, green peppers, rice vinegar, and more sesame oil.  It was great and I'm getting ready to make another batch to eat for lunch this week. Great with rice.

This was super easy and very tasty. I didn't have the chili sauce, so just added some ground hot red pepper flakes.
Used sesame seed instead of sesame oil because I didn't have any on hand.  Used vegetable oil. Served on orzo rice/pasta , this was delicious.  I can think of many variations on this basic recipe.

I have an abundance of Japanese Eggplants from my garden and have been looking for different things to do with them.  I do a lot of Chinese cooking and recalled a recipe similar to this that I did years ago.  Looking this recipe over, it seemed very authentic.  And it is.  The flavors blend beautifully.  Not too spicy.  Just right for me.  I did add about 2 lbs of thinly sliced pork loin, which I marinated for 30 minutes in a mixture of soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch.  I also tripled the sauce.  I stir fried the vegetables, removed them from the pan, and then stir fried my pork separately.  When the pork was cooked, I added the veggies back to the pan and added the sauce.  Beautiful one dish meal that I will definitely be repeating.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Venymae, this is a fabulous recipe!! Although I didn't have chili garlic sauce or toasted sesame oil, I used what I had on hand to substitute. I used all of the listed ingredients, but used Sweet Chili sauce in place of the Chili Garlic Sauce, dry minced garlic instead of fresh garlic, and lastly used toasted sesame seeds instead of toasted sesame oil. I served it over Steamed Brown Rice. My food critic (My hubby,Alex!!) loved it!! I really enjoyed it too, and highly recommend this to everyone!!! Thank you for sharing!!!

I eyeballed this whole recipe and it was good regardless. I do recall using more oyster sauce because who doesn't love oyster sauce?! I also didn't have chili garlic paste, so I chopped garlic and used some chili powder instead.

This is so delicious!  I used Sriracha sauce for the chili garlic sauce.  I also like my eggplant very soft so I cooked it for an additional 20-25 minutes at the end.

This is such a great way to use eggplant! I added some chopped chicken thighs for my men and served this over cauliflower rice. It turned out sooo good and made a great vegetarian and non- vegetarian dinner!

excellent recipe! I don't use the sesame oil or oyster oil and change the onions to scallions (better for people who get migraines). And instead of the chili garlic sauce I use sriracha sauce - its amazing! But if you use too much it is fire hot! be careful. Everything else is exactly the same... wonderful everytime!

The sauce for this recipe is delicious. I was upset to find out that I didn't have the oyster sauce needed for this recipe, and I see how it would have improved the taste. I found that I needed to cook my eggplant a LOT longer for it to be really tender, and I had to keep adding more sauce because it would just dry out after a while, and because it needed more flavor, which was surprising because I only used two eggplants instead of four. Also, I reduced the heat to low, covered the pan, and cooked the eggplants for about 15-20 minutes more than what the recipe called for. I even made extra of the spicy sauce and served it on the side if anyone wanted it extra spicy and flavorful. After making these changes, the recipe turned out really good. Even the 10 year old, who doesn't like eating vegetables at all, couldn't stop going back for more!

Love this recipe. I cook it a lot longer and prepare it in an electric skillet, turn it down to warm after the initial cooking time and just let it sit for an additional hour or so to absorb all the seasonings and sauce. Pairs great with a curry dish. Always a huge hit with family and friends. I do double the chili garlic sauce. Also works well with regular eggplant, it doesn't haveto be the Japanese variety.

Quick easy and delicious!  Not to mention low fat and healthy.  I did eliminate the sugar and used red peppers instead of garlic chili because I didn't have any.

I always struggle with eggplant; I love it when I eat out but when I make it at home it's terrible! This recipe changed that! The ONLY thing I changed was instead of oyster sauce I used fish sauce, and I doubled the sauce (as I roasted chicken thighs on the side and basted them in some of the sauce). Great recipe, will defintely make again. Thanks!

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit b/c I LOVED the sauce so much.  I also try to eat as healthy and natural as possible.  With that being said.  I used less eggplant,but more sauce.  I mixed the eggplant and 2tbs of olive oil in a freezer bag to evenly coat the slices. I cooked it for about 10 minutes b/c I like my eggplant soft.  I also changed the amount of soy sauce, clam sauce, and chili garlic sauce to 1/4 cup each.  Instead of sugar, I added 1 tbs of natural honey, and I used 1/2 cup of water. I like kick, so I added some red pepper flakes at the end as well.

This was great! I used worchestershire sauce instead of oyster sauce, as one of the other reviewers had mentioned and peeled the eggplant first because I usually find the peel to be too tough. It was great! I did cook it longer than recommended, but it was wonderful!

I made a few months ago, in the fall.  I'm just now writing my review.  I used chili sauce and added more fresh garlic than the recipe called for.  I added some dried chili pepper, because I like spicy. I added some fresh green beans and it turned out wonderful.  The only thing I had an issue with was the liquid.  It seemed that the eggplant kept soaking up whatever liquid I added.

Great dish!  Quick, easy, and low cal and so stinkin' good!  I made modifications like some others' reviews:  rice wine vinegar instead of water, low sodium worcestershire instead of oyster sauce (don't have any), and upped the chili paste b/c it can never be too spicy for me.  Also used coconut oil to stir fry the veggies and tossed in about a cup of sliced baby bella mushrooms that were fixin to go bad.  This is a great recipe to play around with and add other ingredients.  I can't wait to have my leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe rocks! Just made it and couldn't wait to review and rave and say thanks for sharing it! Yummmmm! Didn't have Oyster sauce so took the tip about using worcestershire sauce Instead.  Do not skip sesame oil drizzle; really brings it all together.  Thanks again!

Very tasty! I made this exact to the recipe. Although the recipe didn't specify, I did peel the eggplant. The only difference, was that I added cooked cubed chicken and served the meal over jasmine rice. Will make again.

I make this often.  Our family loves it.  Sometimes I add other veggies too.  I don't use the oyster sauce, because I am a vegetarian, but it is awesome and I am an American, living in Beijing and I have served it to local Chinese people who loved it too.  I serve it with rice and put spicy peanuts on top.

Used most of the same changes as "Spyce" & used miniature white eggplant & dark purple. The chili garlic sauce I used (tuong ot toi Vietnam) was very hot, but great.

There are many other easy eggplant recipes that tastes so much better than this one! Way too much onions and the sauce taste was below average; both my husband and I didn't like it at all and we normally love asian food.

Yummy! Made half the recipe using black bean garlic paste instead of oyster sauce and half the amount of onions. Followed one suggestion &added a splash of rice vinegar but it wasn't necessary really. I would definitely add tofu next time. Thanks for a great, easy recipe that worked well with my homegrown japanese eggplants. I used a little extra water for steaming.

Just tried this recipe and it was a hit.  I substituted hoisin sauce for the oyster sauce as I can't eat seafood, and added some crushed red pepper as we like things spicy.  Everyone thought the flavor was fantastic.  My only fault was the consistency of the eggplant.  A little too mushy for my taste.  Next time I will cook the eggplant less.  The leftovers were great over plain ramen noodles for lunch!

A tasty, easy way to use the Japanese eggplant in our garden.  I made this last night and it got rave reviews and disappeared quickly.  I will definately be making this often.  It's great for a light supper, side dish or an hors devours.

This was better than anything I've ordered at a restaurant and healthier, too!
I didn't have any oyster sauce so I just omitted it. I added thinly sliced mushrooms and served it over quinoa. It had just the right amount of heat for me. This is going to be my go-to eggplant recipe from now on!

Add more chili paste to make it spicier. Cashews for crunch. Green onions for color. Serve on rice noodles.

Came out good but I did some changes. I browned 3 chicken breast cubed and then added the eggplant. And to the sauce I added 1Tbsn of teriyaki sauce, 1/2 Tbsn of fish sauce and I didn't have any garlic chilli so I replace it with 1/4 Tbsn of red pepper flakes.

Excellent! I add shrimp for my husband for protein, and I also double the sauce, definitely a keeper.

This was an excellent dish.  I added firm tofu which soaked up a lot of the flavor and made it more of a main dish for my family.

This is a good basic recipe.I added more sweet red chilli sauce  and garlic and added a pound of ground pork to the onion/ garlic mix until it was browned. i then  added eggplant and finished with sliced green onions on top at the end. It brightened the look of the dish

This is very good. I didn't even have all the ingredients and it still turned out great. I had sesame infused olive oil which I used instead of the salad oil. And then topped it with some actual sesame seeds. I didn't have the oyster sauce or the garlic sauce. I would make this again.
