After reading other reviews I tweaked it a bit. I agree it's not enough liquid. I doubled it using 4 cups chicken broth. I used a can of cream of chicken soup. Omit the onion soup mix all together, it's just too salty and oniony. Plus I don't like mixing beef stock/bouillon and chicken stock/bouillon in the same recipe.  Added 1tsp of dried thyme leaves , one garlic clove minced and one bay leaf. Also used skinless bone-in chicken breasts because that's what I had. The bone-in def adds flavour 

Tasted great and was perfect comfort food

I made it to-day and found there really wasn't enough liquid so I added some chicken stock and the taste was primarily the onion soup mix - Not crazy about it and won't make again.

Easy recipe.  Takes no time to make. Skipped the onion and onion packet. Overwhelms the chicken.

I will make again...   I followed the advice of another poster and doubled liquid. I used cream of chicken  and low sodium cream of mushroom and for water, I added broth from chicken I had canned. I added a bit of sriracha for my guys who love their food with  a little kick. Normally I add more seasoning initially but forgot. The fresh celery and onion however were plenty to give that added flavor. And I did use the lipton onion soup. It doesn't overpower the soup as some said  as long as there is enough liquid. 2 hours on high, it was done I was amazed. My intent was to let it simmer a while. It was perfect then but the real test is when the guys come home  ;). I will use this again. 

Oh I added a few leftovers I had on hand - yellow rice, 2 small baked potatoes and small amount of squash/zucchini. Not needed for what I consider an already 5 star soup but  got carried away and  It only enhanced the recipe.

I gave 4 rather than the 5 star because the recipe needs the extra liquid  and the addition of sriracha to give it a bit of zing

After reading the reviews I searched for the personal recipe version of this knowing that sometimes ingredients and amounts  get lost in the translation from the personal to the published recipe. I couldn't find the personal version so I went with doubling the amount of liquid. I used chicken broth in place of the water and added cream of chicken to go with the mushroom soup. The onion soup mix compliments the soup and does not overpower it. I'll definitely make this again. Couple of squirts of Sriracha brings it up to 5 stars.

I rated 5 stars. But I did doubled up on water (used 4 cups total after reading many reviewers concerns about saltiness & not enough water at the end). Also, added lots of veggies close to the top (more than doubled on veggies overall): celery, kale, onions, carrots, mushrooms. And it came out fantastic! It was not “chickeny” or “oniony” taste-wise. I did add the onion soup mix and condensed cream of mushroom just as the recipe called for. It will come out fine as long as the tweaks mentioned above are made. Enjoy!

Made as according to the recipe. It's okay, a little too much chicken for me. In the future, I will like reduce the chicken by half and double up on all the vegetables. The onion soup mix didn't bother me, but I will probably use chicken stock rather than water.

Doubled the water. Better to use less onion flavoring.

I was looking for a easy but delicious recipe for chicken soup and found it! I did read the reviews and took a few suggestions, however. Instead of 2 cups of water I used 4 cups of chicken stock. Also I did use the onion soup mix despite a few reviewers recommending against it. The onion soup mix adds flavor and did not make the soup salty. I added 4 small diced red potatoes and added one extra can of cream of chicken soup. My husband and I loved this creamy soup. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe & instead of frozen veggies I came home from work and added canned potatoes, carrots, corn. Great comfort food.
