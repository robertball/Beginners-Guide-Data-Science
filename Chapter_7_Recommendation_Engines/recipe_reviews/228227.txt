Delicious, juicy, and amazing! I made red wine rice and garlic butter asparagus to complete the meal and it was off the charts good!

I would've given this 5 stars, as it was a VERY good marinade for salmon.  The lemon juice accents the fish wonderfully.  However, there is something missing.  I added some red pepper to it, and think that I should probably have added a little more.  It needs more flavor, and I think the red pepper is it, just more than the 1/4 tsp. that I added.  Maybe more like 3/4 tsp. would do it.

this was a good starting point.. i used this to marinate 1.5 lbs of salmon fillets even though this calls for 3 lbs.. i cut down on the oil quite a bit, just drizzling a little in.. i added an extra tbsp of lemon juice and 2 tbsp of lime juice.. i subbed cilantro for parsley and probably doubled or tripled the amount.. i used dried rosemary (1/4 tsp) and dried ground thyme (a little less than 1/16 tsp).. doubled the salt but used kosher.. doubled the black pepper.. subbed 2 garlic cloves for the powder and added a small baby jalapeno to the mix.. i threw everything into my food processor and let the salmon sit in the marinade for about 8 hours.. bf grilled this off-set smoker style.. i thought it was going to be more bold, but this was still delicious.. ty for the recipe

With a dash of Cayenne, bit of ginger, my kids loved this recipe! Served with salad and brown rice, made a very clean, healthy summer meal.

Was delightful. Light delicate flavor leaving the salmon to stand out. Did leave parsley out. Served with a mango salsa. A hit with my guests

We loved this salmon!  I didn't have the spices available, so I used an Italian herb mix in the marinade.  It was great!

Yum!!! We live in salmon country, and eat it year round.  I loved the idea of this recipe because I grow all of the herbs.  It was great, and mild enough to not overpower the fish.  I'll be able to vary this up depending on my garden, and it's an easy thing to grow together.  I even marinated a whole sockeye in it and froze it for eating later - the lemon will help it keep nicely.

It didn't excite me. Maybe if it were marinated overnight? The herb flavors just didn't shine through. Mediterranean Salmon on this site is my favorite and the maple is a very close second that my kids love, too.

Super yummy! I used my George Forman and it turned out great! It was my first time cook in salmon. Pretty easy. I flipped it once and removed the skin.

Good, but I thought it was a little on the bland side even with a dash of cayenne, but my family really liked it.  I had some of it as leftovers the next day and actually enjoyed it more; I guess the flavors blended.  Next time I may add some additional spice to pep it up.

Great mild flavor. We were out of garlic powder so substituted a clove of minced garlic in the marinade. 20 mins was perfect timing on a medium grill. Would be great with a white wine such as Chardonnay. We will have the wine on hand for next time we make this recipe.

Easy to fix but keep in mind you have to let it marinate for 30 minutes . I thought it lacked flavor. I really thought it would have more flavor with the fresh herbs but was sadly disappointed.

I grilled these  salmon filets in my cast iron grill pan on the kitchen stove (looked like rain for grilling out). I loved the herb~ oil~lemon combo. I had all the herbs and onion in my garden. Broke up some romaine, to make a ceasar salad. We had Salmon/Ceasar salad with garlic bread for dinner!! Thanks for sharing.

Sorry to say, but I felt  this resulted in a very bland tasting salmon.  Because it is lower in sodium than the delicious soy sauce/brown sugar based marinades, and had fresh herbs, I was really hoping it would turn out better than it did.

I doubled this recipe and baked two fillets and it was pretty boring with almost no flavor. I might need to triple or quadruple the recipe for two fillets?

Made this the other day for my 8yr old & parents. LOVED IT!!!! I didn't have any green onion & after marinading for 30min I placed the salmon in a foil boat & poured the remaining marinade over it. Turned out perfect!!! Will definitely make again :-)

This is delicious!! I brush on a honey BBQ sauce a few times during the last half of cooking. it makes a tasty glaze that compliments the salmon well.

Made it just like the recipe stated and turned out great.  Hubby liked it and he's pretty picky about his food.  This recipe will be a keeper.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use a sweet marinade and chose this one. This one goes to the top of my list for grilled salmon, it is fantastic. As was suggested by the  submitter I added a little crushed red pepper and everybody loved it. I highly recommend it

We loved this and it is so easy to prepare, and so quick!!  I never have fresh herbs so I just used minced onions, garlic powder, thyme, kosher salt, and pepper with the olive oil and lemon juice and it worked beautifully. For my husband and I we purchased 1 lb. salmon and I halved the marinade ingredients.

I made this for dinner and went with the suggestion of another reviewer- I added 1/2-3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper to the mix.  We all  thought it was very good.  My favorite grilled recipe involves orange juice, ketchup and soy sauce, but this was the best "herb-based" salmon recipe I think I have made.  I will definitely be trying it again.

I have tried some of the other salmon recipes on here.  This one is the BEST and it encourages me to eat more salmon.  Easy to make.  IF you don't have a grill, use your electric skillet and maybe a small cookie sheet.  Cook the salmon in the cookie sheet inside the electric skillet.  It will come out like grilled, but without the stripes.  YUMMY!  I have to force myself to eat salmon, but this one makes it easy!

Delicious as written. Hint for the grill: dip the skin side in flour and it will not stick to the grate. Once the white juice shows at the top, check for doneness. I take it off slightly before I think it is done to avoid over cooking.

Hubby loves salmon so I made this for dinner.  We both loved it, which was a shock, since I am not a salmon lover.  I used our indoor grill pan and it worked great.

This recipe is pretty good but I didn't like the rosemary with the fish.  Rosemary goes better with beef or lamb in my opinion.
