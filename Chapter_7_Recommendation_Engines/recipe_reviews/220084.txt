I make this all the time as a quick dinner. It's really bendable to what you have on hand, any kind of pasta or sausage links. I sometimes cut the pasta back and throw in more vegetables (chunked zucchini, mushrooms, more red pepper). If I have extra time, I'll throw together a batch of quick marinara. I like to make fresh rolls or garlic bread to go with. My family really enjoys this dish. NOTE: Some jarred pasta sauces can be a little bland, keep that in mind and add in some spices to taste if needed.

This is one of our family's all-time favorites!  SOOO easy to make, and sometimes we just use the pasta, pasta sauce and grilled sausage.  If you have a good sauce, you don't need the rest!

Very good! I cooked the sausage in a skillet on the stove instead of the grill, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.

I've been making this basic recipe for almost 25 years now. My husband really loves it. I don't use the parsley as I don't think it adds very much. We like it spicy so I use hot Italian Sausage. Really gives it a good bite. I also change up the sauce all the time. But the Tomato Basil is the best as it compliments the spicy Italian Sausage the best.  For color I use both red and green peppers as well.

Was great. The whole family enjoyed it. I couldn't find the Italian links by Johnsonville anywhere. I ended up using Kielbasa Sausage and adding Italian Seasoning to the sauce and used a jar of Italian Pasta Sauce. Definitely a repeat recipe.

I used smoked sausage instead of the Italian sausage. I also did not add the chopped parsley. 
I cut up the sausage and fried it in a skillet and then I sauteed onions and garlic in the same skillet that I had used for the sausage.  Added spanish and zucchini to the dish.
Everyone (including my pickiest eaters) liked it!

Very easy and very good! It takes no time at all to put this together for a quick weeknight meal. So, even if you're short on time you can have a nice Italian dinner without a lot of fuss and the leftovers freeze well. All I had to add was a nice garden salad and garlic breadsticks!

This was so yummy and very easy to make.  A dinner you can make after a long days work.  There is also plenty left over for leftovers.

This was definitely a nice change of pace.  Instead of canned sauce, I used homemade tomato sauce.  I think the recipe calls for more pasta than is needed.  Had green bell peppers on hand so I used those instead of red.  It will be added to our rotation of dishes, as it was a really nice 'make ahead' meal.

This was a super-simple, easy weeknight meal and we loved it!  I couldn't find the Johnsonville Italian sausage so I used the Johnsonville Italian Chicken sausage and I'm hooked.  I didn't have any pre-made pasta sauce so I sauteed some onion and garlic with the sausage until the onions were cooked.  Then I added some plain tomato sauce along with fresh thyme and dried basil and oregano.  I let all of this simmer while I cooked my pasta (I had to use whole wheat, bowtie pasta - that's all I had.)  Put it all together and topped with a bit of parmesan cheese.  I wanted to go back for seconds but the husband ate it all - ha.  I'd love to try it with zucchini or mushrooms, also (there's really no limit to the veggies you can put in this.)  Love anything that I can put together so quickly after a long day at work, plus it's versatile to adapt to you pantry ingredients.  A keeper for sure!

I made this easy meal for my roommates and they loved it. few ingredients, big flavor. The only suggestion would be to cut back on the noodles and put more veggies in the sauce.

This was a great recipe.  I added mushroomed to the sauce and topped with Italian five cheese. I would make truism again for a quick meal.

Not our favorite...  I added some roasted onion, garlic and corn... trying to make this a little more interesting... The recipe is very simple and fast, I guess its ok for a quick meal... I have come to love Johnsonville Sausage and I don't think this recipe does the flavor or freshness of this product any justice seems to only hide it's great taste with the heavy sauce and uninspired pasta.

I absolutely loved this! I used ground mild sausage and green bell peppers because I didn't have any red ones. This was so pretty in the bowl and delicious too. We sprinkled parmesan cheese on top but followed everything else as written.

This was great. Easy to put together on a week night and very tasty. I did use my own homemade marinara in place of the jar of sauce called for, otherwise stayed true to the recipe. My husband ate so much there was none leftover for my lunch tomorrow!

Made it just like it said and it is DELICIOUS!  Here's what I would suggest:  Cut the bell pepper to 1/2-inch rather than 1-inch pieces.  Cook the sausage, remove from pan, slice, and drain all but about a tablespoon of fat from pan.  Return sausage to pan and add bell peppers; saute a few minutes to soften.  Add the sauce & garlic and let simmer while you boil the pasta.  Drain pasta, pour sauce mixture on top, and add the parsley if you want.  Stir to mix and you're done.

The family liked this, was easy to do. My only draw-backs after seeing how the family was plating their bowls....was they were grabbing more of the meat and equal parts of the noodles and could have used a bit more sauce. Having said that....16 ounces of noodles is too much, that leaves little room for enough pasta sauce to go around and doesn't stay moist. Ending up in adding more sauce to accomendate the leftovers. I'd make this again, in a heartbeat, but would curve my pasta to about 10-12 ounces only.

Made this last night minus the red peppers (no one here eats them) and the family and I really enjoyed it. I took one star away because of the pasta amount. It calls for way too much when you compare it to how much meat you have (at least for us.) Maybe a smaller pasta or halving it would help, we will cut the amount down the next time I cook this!

Delicious! The red pepper/pasta sauce stands up nicely to the rigatoni and sausage. This dish is full of bold flavor. No variations needed. Just garnished with grated Parmesan cheese.

I made this recently and loved it. I had all the ingredients on hand. I would leave out the red bell pepper next time. It doesnt really add anything to the dish. I also used Albertsons brand plain spaghetti sauce and added McCormick Italian Seasoning. Other than those modifications it was great!

I made this recipe on 03/08/2017 and I followed exactly except after reading other reviewers I added tsp each of oregano, Italian, and garlic powder.  The entire family enjoyed this dish.  I am making this dish again tonight and am making the Real Southern Cornbread recipe as a side also from this site.

This is great - very similar to a dish I make regularly at home. Due to family preference, I replace the red pepper with mushrooms, and I always make my own pasta sauce. Other than that, this recipe is solid as written and even my 9 month old loves chewing on a piece of pasta or two. Can easily adapt this to suit your taste buds - I enjoy topping it with cheese to serve or deglazing the pan with a little red wine. Will make this over and over.

I will make this again as it's a quick dinner.  It was great!  I served it over angel hair pasta and used a garlic parm sauce instead of marinara as I'm allergic to tomatoes.

I LOVE the ease of this recipe!!  A quick meal.  It actually is a lot like spaghetti, just a different type of pasta.  I think I like this better.

I used eckrich smoked sausage instead, because I don't like italian sausage.   It was precooked so I think it made it even faster to cook.  I added zucchini and mushrooms and that was really good.  Overall a very tasty dish that can be tweaked to your tastes easily. Yum!!  Oh and I thought the fresh parsley was a waste of time. I bought it, in the only way it came, big grouped bunches and I used the tiniest bit and I doubt I will use it again before it goes bad. Next time I'll just use dry parsley seasoning.

While we didn't make this exactly as the recipe stated, we were close enough to honor the flavor!  This was a flavorful and easy dish that I think we will experiment with in the future.

I followed the recipe almost exact. I just didn't have any fresh parsley. It turned out good and my 3 year old who is a picky eater liked it. So I consider it a good easy night dinner!

I have to say for such an easy recipe, this was incredibly good. Used Prego roasted garlic and  parmesan sauce, grilled the sausage and fresh grated parmesan cheese. Family lived it.

This was very simple to make and very delicious. I made this once with andouille sausage instead of Italian. It was still very tasty, but not for the feint of heart when it comes to spiciness.

This was a hit at my house! My family demolished this dish! I removed the sausage from casing and crumbled to cook in a skillet. The only other change I made was using a green bell pepper instead of a red.  Will definitely make this one again!

The Johnsonville recipes are so easy and full of flavor! I used the original brawts because my store didn't have any mild Italian sausage left. I used some roasted vegetable sauce from Sonoma Gourmet and stuck to the recipe. So good! I am putting this into my dinner rotation.

This was an excellent dish and easy to prepare.  The garlic and red pepper add a nice flavor to the prepared sauce we used.  Just looking through the pictures I saw many variations and that is what is terrific about a dish like this., it is easy to make it yours.  We loved it and will definitely be making this again!

One of my favorite Johnsonville Sausage recipes!  I have made this many times and it is always delicious!  I like adding in a diced onion to go with the peppers and garlic, but really, that's the only modification I make to this.  It is easy, delicious, and very filling.  All you need is a salad and a nice piece of garlic bread and you are set!

There are absolutely zero surprises with this meal; it tastes exactly like you think it would.  It is good; I actually don't think the red peppers added a whole lot, so if you don't have them, I wouldn't worry about it.  I used three cheese Johnsonville sausage.

I made this with the 3-cheese Italian-style sausage and penne rigate and it was very good. Skipped the green pepper as I don't care for them and used red and yellow.  Would make again!

This was a very easy shortcut weeknight meal to prepare.   I used penne shaped pasta instead of rigatoni because it was what I had in my cabinet.  I also used Johnsonville 50% pork/50% chicken mild Italian sausage to cut back on some of the fat calories. The fresh parsley brightened up the dish and gave it a fresher flavor.   I rounded out the meal with a simple green salad and French rolls.  Simple and tasty!
