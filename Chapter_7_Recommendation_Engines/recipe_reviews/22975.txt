I can't believe the dismal reviews for this bread. This recipe is a definite keeper! it is the only bread machine recipe that I have that turns out fool-proof every single time I make it! I use it to (1) make stuffing (2) I also make turkey sandwiches with cranberry sauce and I get requests to make it many times.  thanks for a great recipe!

For some reason it didn't seem to have enough liquid to mix it up in the machine.  I made it twice and added a little warm water while it was mixing (just enough water to pull it together.)  I think the celery seed is a little strong but that is an easy fix.  Right out of the oven it is excellent.  I think it ranks right up there with the chili bread I have made from this website.  It smells great mixing AND baking.  Thanks for another keeper!!

I thought it was great!  This bread was also delicious toasted with a slice of cheese.

My intent in making this was for sandwiches for hub's lunch but at the rate I'm eating this it won't last long.  Yep, it's that good. I didn't have celery seed so I tried to compensate with a little fresh, minced celery leaves.  Also added maybe 1-1/2 tsp. of fresh, minced sage along with the rubbed sage called for. Other than that I made no other substitutions or additions. What I got was a bread so fragrant it left me hungry for it before it was even done baking, and I cut into it immediately after it came out of the oven! It is lightly, but perfectly, seasoned and has a little rustic heartiness about it because of the cornmeal. It's a light brown in color, moist but not TOO moist and enough density and heft to take it seriously! I suppose, however, that how the texture turns out can be largely determined by bread machine, humidity, amount and type of yeast, etc. I used active dry yeast where I normally use quick-rise and I did notice a difference from other breads I've made. I actually think I prefer the active dry - it doesn't overrise as the quick-rise tends to for me. Very similar to another bread on this site, I know hubs is gonna love this and I'll be making it often.  Great recipe!

I was very pleased with this bread.  I served it fresh from the breadmaker with corned beef and cabbage.  We used the bread without butter to mop up the broth from the corned beef.  Very tasty indeed!!

This is an excellent bread.  Cube it up a little larger than the cubes you buy in a bag and you'll never have better dressing!  Also makes a wonderful bread for the leftover Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches!

Yummy.  Took some tips from previous reviewers and subbed honey for sugar and upped the amounts of the seasonings, particularly the poultry seasoning.  Also subbed a garlic/herb olive oil for the butter. Baked in oven once dough cycle was done.  Hard crust, yielding to a soft chewy dough.

Very good recipe. Great texture and heavenly smell!  I think next time I'll add more spices. Best when served warm.

Tasted just like stuffing.  Made in my bread machine and was very quick and easy, but will try a loaf pan next time.  Very good bread.

I thought this bread was a pretty neat idea, and I think it must be really good for stuffing (obviously). On its own, it has good flavor from the herbs (I added fennel seeds too). It turned out a tad dry though.

I made this a while ago and I guess forgot to rate it.  Anyway, it's an easy and delicious bread.  I like the flavor--really does taste like stuffing.  I made in my bread machine as directed and actually let it do it's entire thing; usually I take it out and bake it in the oven.  Either the recipe didn't say or I didn't look for the crust setting.  I did medium crust and in my bread machine that makes the crust a bit too tough on this bread.  It was hard to cut!  But otherwise it was delish.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I made this as a 1lb loaf 2/3 cup milk was clearly not enough. I used 3/4 cup and this was very close as I added about 2 tsp more during mixing. This baked a very nice loaf, although it did over rise slightly.

I would recomend this bread for people that like bread with other stuff in it like nuts and grains and herbs.  I personally like white bread and never buy even wheat bread so that is why i have rated this 3 stars.  I don't think the recipe is bad.  I think it is a matter of personal taste for me.

Seriously delicious and so fragrant! I subbed WW pastry flour for 1/2 cup of the flour, used honey in place of the sugar, not as much salt, and I forgot the egg! Had to cut a piece & butter it fresh from the oven--yum! This should be awesome on a sandwich.
