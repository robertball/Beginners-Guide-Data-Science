After reading the other reviews, I added a generous amount of orange juice ( 250-400ml?) and about 100ml of water and stirred before putting into the oven for an hour. Millet softened and it tasted great with vanilla soya yogurt!

I like the idea of a two-ingredient anything especially when neither of those is sugar. The only issue I had was the millet never got soft, but always have that crunchy edge to it. I added the cinnamon directly into the mixture before baking. It took a lot longer than 90 minutes for me. I used a Jonagold apple that I shredded with a spiral vegetable cutter and followed the recipe exactly. I ended up mixing the leftover with some warm milk making a breakfast cereal out of it the next day. Thank you for the recipe.

I loved the idea of this recipe but was disappointed.   I had the same problem as the other reviewer, the millet never softened even though I followed the recipe exactly.
