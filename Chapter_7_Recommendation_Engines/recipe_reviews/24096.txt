Very good!  I basically just used the crisp topping in this recipe, using all whole-wheat pastry flour for the white.  It was delicious!  I hate canned cherry pie filling, so instead, I used one 16 oz. bag of frozen sweet dark cherries from Trader Joe's, and one can of sour pie cherries.  I poured the juice from the can in because I like juicy crisp desserts.  I added no additional sugar.  Put the crisp all on top and used the same size pan called for in the recipe.  It was perfect!

Good overall flavor (I used blueberry filling).  I will, however, have to play with the recipe.  When I think of "crunch", I like it all to be crunchy.  The layer on the bottom got too soft for my taste.  Next time I'll put it all on top.  Also, I won't use rolled oats again, the texture wasn't right.  I'll use the quick oats next time.

Very good and very simple to make.  I added a splash of almond extract to give it a boost of cheery flavor.  I also didn't make the bottom layer with the oat mixture.  I used it all on top.  Definately a keeper...great for when unexpected company arrives!

This is DELICIOUS. Because I don't ever buy canned pie filling, I made my own from frozen cherries and a mixture of water, a little lemon juice, vanilla extract, sugar and cornstarch. I served this crisp style with a dollop of whipped topping--we all really liked it. Next time, I'll try this with homemade apple pie filling and apple pie spice. I think that would be REALLY tasty.

When Mr. LTH's stepfather requested "something cherry" for his birthday dessert (and his celebration got bumped up at the last minute), this is what I stumbled upon to make for him.  This is GREAT and easy!  The only change I made was to add some almond paste to the crunch (thanks, Marie C!) as I'd planned to add almond extract but found myself out of it!  I couldn't find any of my 8X8 pans, so I needed to use a larger pan and, as such, used 2 cans of filling but left everything else the same.  Awesome.  We liked it so much, I made it 3 days later for Christmas.  When I made for Christmas (in 2 pie plates because I still can't find any of my square glass pans!), I accidentally used a jar of RED RASPBERRY filling in one pan and I think I actually liked that even better.  All in all, a great simple recipe.  THANKS, Timothy!

Umm-umm good! This was so quick & easy!! We loved it!!! As someone else suggested, I added a splash of almond extract to the cherries. I also added a little more butter & some water because the crumb mixture seemed too dry. Maybe it's suppose to since it is a "crumb"  mixture. Next time I'll leave out the water to see the difference. We are ancious to try this w/ apple & blue-berry pie fillings.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This is almost exactly like my recipe that I've been using for years.  The butter,flour, sugar and oats are the same, but I don't use cinnamon and I DO use 3/4 t. baking powder and 1/4 t. salt.  I just happened to have made this tonight and then saw the photo.  One thing that I might recommend is to mix the crumbs with your hands.  The warmth of your hands softens the butter and makes nice little clumps instead of dry powdery crumbs.

I double the batch and made in a 9X15 cake pan for a morning breakfast for my co-workers. I put one layer of the crumble in my pan and pressed it down.  Then baked it for 10 minutes before putting the cherries on top along with the rest of the crumble. I then baked for 30 more minutes. Turned out petty good…I would make again. It wasn’t a to-die for dessert but good.

I made this for a work birthday breakfast party and everyone loved it!  I did modify the recipe.  Used two packets of brown sugar and cinnamon instant oatmeal instead of tthe rolled oats.  Used a stick and a half of butter and  added one whole packet plus two sheets of graham crackers to recipe (regular graham crackers).  Sprinkled lots of cinamon on top.

Yum! I agree with the other reviewer who said this is even better cold. I followed the recipe but did put all the crunch on top as I did not want to risk a soggy bottom. In the future, I will add maybe another half can of cherry pie filling to make the ratio of crunch to fruit more equal.

Delicious!!  I made exactly as recipe the first time & it was great!  The second time I added 3/4 tsp baking powder & a 1/4 tsp of salt to the crumb mixture.  And added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cherry.  (Oh!  and baked the crumb 'crust' for 10 minutes before topping with cherries, to keep it from getting soggy)  Even better!!   (I'm dying to try this with apple or blueberry pie filling -- or even PEACH!!)  Yum!

THIS is the recipe I have been looking for since my childhood!  I learned this while I was young and it is still a winner recipe.  Delicious should not be this easy but I love it when this happens as I'm such a busy mom.  As stated by many, it's a versatile recipe changing out your canned pie fillings, and adding extra's such as cinnamon to apple pie filling, almond flavoring to cherry pie filling, lemon extract to blueberry pie filling, etc.  It's simple, fast, delicious and my kind of recipe for busy nights.

OMG, OMG, this is the best cherry crunch I have ever had. Followed recipe EXACTLY. I burnt my tongue because I couldn't wait for it to cool, but it was worth it. It is so easy to make and I think I will try a readers suggestion and double it and use a 9 x 13 pan. I am also going try other fillings, but I think cherry will end up being my favorite. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!

Crisp part is almost perfect, agree with others and add a tsp of either vanilla or almond extract. It is a good base to use and try with other fruits. Used 2 cans of cherry pie filling. 1 just wasn't enough. Next time we will try fresh cherries/sugar, etc. We like this both cold and right out of the oven with ice cream.

So easy!  So Good!  I will definitely use it with other pie fillings as a great and fast way for that sweet tooth need.  After reading several reviews (thank you for your comments) I added more butter, brown sugar and cooked it longer as well.  This made a more moist, yet still crispy dessert so I believe.  Excellent, thanks!

Made this this past weekend.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to the oat/flour mix on top of the cherry filling.  I had found a similar recipe that did that and it sounded good...chocolate and cherries are a great combo.  This is another do over!!!!

Delicious! I found a can of cherry pie filling in my pantry,and wanted to make something different with it, for a quick saturday dessert. I did add a bit more butter, maybe 1/4 cup, and mixed everything with my hands so the butter could soften. Also baked the bottom layer for about 15 mins first before adding the cherries and the topping. I added a tad of vanilla to my cherries(just because i seem to add vanilla to everything). With the topping part i added a handful of mini chocolate chip, not becuase i wanted to change the recipe but just because i LOVE chocolate. Baked everything for another 30 mins and it came out wonderful. This recipe if foresure a keeper. The crumble topping is yummy, would love to try this with other fruits.

This is an excellent dessert. I have been making it for many years on Valentine's Day. We call it "Cherry Delight". Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I add one other ingredient and that is 1 tsp. almond extract to the cherry pie filling.

Delicious. I made it for a friend who had knee replacement surgery, my Mom made the dinner and I made the dessert - I gave them a small pint of vanilla ice cream to go with the dessert. I changed a few things based on reviews: I used 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of soft butter, I used 1 cup of brown sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the cherries. It was great - and I don't normally like cherries.

Absolutely delicious, exactly as written.  So easy and came together quickly.  Love that it doesn't get soggy like crisps sometimes can.  Will definitely make this again.

This was awesome and would be good with other fillings like peach or apple.  I did not put the oat mixture on the bottom, but all on top.  There was SO much of it that I got another can of pie filling and put two cans into a 9x13 and topped.  There was more then enough.

I have made this twice now. I use a 9 x 13 glass pan. Two cans of pie filling, 1 cup of  each of flour, oats, and brown sugar and upped the cinnamon in the topping.  The first time I made it I made a pan of 1/2 cherry and 1/2 blue berry. I did add a little almond flavoring to the cherry - I highly recommend that.  This time I used apple filling and added some chopped pecans to the topping.  Both me and my husband like the cherry best and the blue berry the least.  I think the pecans were fine, but will eliminate it in the future.  This recipe is super easy and will be a regular item in our house.

Ok, so I just made this today and I was very pleased with the result. Wonderful dessert! Like some of the others, I did add almond extract to the canned cherries because those two things just compliment each other so well. Also I did not put the oats in the bottom crust. I just made that with the flour, butter, cinnamon and sugar (as some others suggested) and used the oats, half (or there about)of the flour and cinnamon and butter and sugar to make the crunchy crumb topping. It was superb! Those are the only changes I made in this recipe and I will be making it for years to come. Thank you for sharing!

I stumbled upon this recipe when I was searching for a dessert recipe for a last-minute dinner (and I had a can of cherry pie filling sitting in my pantry for several months!). I was not disappointed! It was super easy to prepare and I assembled it several hours ahead of time and baked it once the main course was out of the oven.

I can't wait to try this again with different pie filling flavours. It tasted great warm from the oven with some vanilla ice cream on the side.

This was excellent. I made it with cherries as the recipe says , but definitely would try is with other fruit. As with a few others, I added a tiny bit more butter (maybe 2 tbsp), and 1/4 teaspoon each of vanilla extract AND almond extract. Loved it, thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful, my husband could not stop talking about it!  Very nice way to use up a can of pie filling that was about to expire.  I added a touch of almond extract as others had suggested, and used whole wheat pastry flour in place of all-purpose.  Will definitely make it again!

Excellent crumble recipie. Instead of canned filling I used 1 bag of frozen (sweet) cherries and one bag of frozen wild blueberries  - no sugar was needed. Next time i will put all of the crumble on top instead of top and bottom. It is just much better as a crispy topping. This is so good and so easy I think it is our new dish for taking to friends or for supper here.

This is a great dessert recipie when you really don't feel like baking.  It only takes a few minutes to prepare then just pop it in the oven while you clean the house.  I know it would be great over vanilla ice cream but I like it just by itself.  I used a "lite" version of the cherry pie filling and it turned out just great.

The first time making this the crumb mixture (bottom) was soggy. I only had Quaker Quick Oats, don't know if that had something to do with it being soggy. In all it tasted really good! The next time I won't crust the bottom and will try other fruits.

Very good, although I think it needs both more crust and more pie filling.  I doubled the crust on this (my first attempt), and next time I will use two cans of pie filling.  Overall very good and easy.

A little bland on its own, but the almond extract recommendation made it delicious.  I love how easy it is to make -- just a matter of throwing things together.

I think "crunch" is a bit misleading. Mine were cruchhy at first, but it gets soft after a day. That's okay though, because they are quite tasty anyway, especially warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I liked that you could gut them into bars (as opposed to a cobbler or crisp), but you still need to eat these with a fork. Overall, very quick and tasty, so I will make again.

Really Good! I increased the oats and flour by half and used 2 cans of pie filling. The cinnamon was a nice addition to the crust part. Would make again- quick, simple.

I tried this a few nights ago.  I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract per someone's recommendation.  The cooking time was pretty spot on, except I left mine in for another 3 minutes just to make sure it was crispy.  The crust was very crunchy and delish.  My husband loved the recipe as well and we had it with vanilla ice cream like cobbler.

So simple, so delicious! I do not believe this recipe needed any amendments, but I was trying to find a way to use up my fresh bing cherries and frozen blackberries. I made my own cherry filling using a pie filling recipe also found on allrecipies, substituting Bing cherries and extracted blackberry juice for tart cherries.  Also, I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I substituted 1/2 butter for 1/2 canola oil and added extra cherry filling. I liked the layered look, so I divided about 2/3 of the crunch, and, following another reviewer's recommendation, I pressed it into the bottom of the pan firmly before adding cherry filling. I like coconut, so I mixed in a 1/2 cup for the top layer and crumbled it on.  After baking, I glazed a bit of powdered sugar almond extract frosting over the top, mostly for appearance. Although my alterations concluded in very little crunch, the end result was fantastic! Sweet and crumbly soft. I didn't even have to eat it with ice cream. This dessert stands on its own! My husband swore this was one of the best desserts I have ever made. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I made it as written, with the oat mixture on the top and bottom and thought it was the perfect ratio of oat mixture to fruit. Make sure to break up the butter into a pretty fine mixture. I left mine a little to chunky and some of the oas/flour mixture was still a little dry after it baked. I doubled the cinnamon and used half whole wheat flour and half white. I took this to dinner at a friend's house and everyone liked it. I served it topped with vanilla ice cream - yummy! Next time, I'm going to add some chopped pecans or walnuts to the oat mixture. Would be wonderful with any kind of fruit filling.

Great hot and cold!  I like more crisp in mine and my husband likes more cherry.  However, I fought my urge to double the crisp and made it as it.  I thought the bars would be extremely thin but it ended up being just right.

This was very good. Took another reviewer's advice and used a bag of frozen dark cherries and a can of tart pie cherries and mixed those together with no sugar and put the crust only on the top. Served it with ice cream. Very easy and flavorful dessert.

Simple and impressive. I goofed and realized after putting in the oven that I forgot the brown sugar! So I scraped off the top layer, added 1/2 the called for brown sugar, baked it, and it still came out great! I added the almond extract to filling as advised, and also added chopped toasted almonds to top layer of crumb.  I baked in a springform pan, and if you can wait til it cools, it will cut into squares quite nicely

WOW!!! My son approved, the one child that won't eat stuff like this, has been slowly trying everything I now make as a promise to try before he decides...All my kids agreed that they really really liked it, but said it tasted like some thing they'd eat at breakfast. Well.....okay. I guess if that works for them, then I'm happy. I heard no complaints. I didn't try it myself, but the yum's from everyone tells me it was a keeper. Thanks

Tasty and easy--my kind of recipe. I added 1/4 tsp. of almond flavoring to the canned cherry. It's delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream. I'm sure I'll use this recipe many times..  Thanks for posting.

I really, really liked this!  I did take the advice of others and added about 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the cherry pie filling and about 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the "crunch".  It turned out perfectly.  I was surprised that you could cut it into squares, rather than having to scoop it out.  Next time I'd love to try peach pie filling.

I liked the ease of prep for this dish.  Everyone cleared the pan.  You can't expect something to taste totally "home made" when the main component comes out of a can (pie filling).  I would like the crunch to have been a little better tho. Will make this if I'm ever in a complete dessert rush since I do have everything in the pantry.

I was looking for a sweet, crunchy dessert, and I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  It seemed dry - but I think that I could add a little more butter and this would be great.  I will make it again because my husband loved it!

This is very good and a simple recipe!  This time I used a frozen triple berry blend with no added sugar, and I did omit the cinnamon.  It was excellent served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I did drizzle a little melted butter on top before putting in the oven because it did look sort of dry.  Next time I will probably double up on the fruit and cut the "crunch" mixture in half. (will not have a bottom crust)  This was a big hit with our family....my oldest son announced that he will be having this tomorrow morning for breakfast!

Wont make again.  Nothing special, I have made much better crisps. The topping was dry, so add more butter if you intend to make it.

MMMM, YUM-YUM!! My husband loved it and said to put it in the list of recipes to make again. :-) The crunch was really nice and my husband thought I used almonds. LOL. I did make some changes though. I used the healthier graham cracker crust for the bottom and sprinkled half the recipe of crunch on top. Thanks a lot for the great recipe.

I tried this tonight because I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand, it was very easy to make, smelled wonderful while baking, and tasted great, the only thing I would change 'maybe' is saving more of the oat mixture for topping and using less as crust. Thanks for the recipe.

Had to try this with frozen from fresh cherries. It's a keeper and very versatile. I took all the cumulative advice by doubling the recipe, adding almond extract, incorporating the cold butter by hand and prebaking the bottom crust for 13 minutes. To 5 cups of cherries, I added a scant cup of sugar, almond extract but instead of flour I used 4T victorio instant clearjel in a slurry with a cup of water. 
Thanks to all who left their baking tips; my cherry crunch turned out perfectly.

This is so easy & good! I pre-baked the bottom layer for 10 minutes and added 1 tsp. almond extract to the cherry pie filling as recommended by reviewers, then followed the recipe. The top wasn't crunchy when we ate it the next morning, even after warming it on "broil" for 10 minutes. No matter - it was still tasty with coffee & ice cream.

My family loved this.  I am not a fan of cherries but my husband is, so I made one Apple and one Cherry. I loved the apple one.  I took another reviewers tip and pressed half the crumb mixture into the pan and baked for about 10 minutes before adding the pie filling and sprinkling the remaining crumb mixture on top.

This was very good.  I added 2 Tbs. of butter to the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe.  I also added 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the cherries.  The bottom crust was too soft to be cut into bars.  I am refrigerating overnight in hopes of firming them up.  Next time, I will bake the bottom crust for 10 minutes before topping with the cherries and topping.  I will definitely make these again.  I may try the unsweetened canned cherries as these were a little too sweet with the regular canned cherries.

Yum! Yum!.  This was fantastic.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and baked the bottom crust for 8 minutes at 300.  It won rave reviews when served at a party with ice cream.  So good.

quite good.  I added about 1/4 cup more oats, but it wasn't necessary as it was a bit much and olive oil margarine for less fat.  Next time I will also add a bit more cherries as I like a bit more cherries.  I used the oat mixture on top only and fruits at the bottom.  Wonderful with ice cream.
Wonderful desert.  Thanks for sharing

Made this with fresh cherries and 1/2 cup fresh blueberries. Used the cherry pie filling recipe on this site but didn't make it on the stove (just mixed together the ingredients). Reduced sugar in filling to 3/4 cup (these were sweet cherries) and added lemon juice/vanilla. Put all of the oat topping on top. This barely fit in my cake pan so I put another pan below it to catch drippings. Thanks!!

Like many other reviewers, I didn't put the crust on the bottom for fear of it getting soggy.  Make sure you put plenty of the crumble on top.  Don't skimp, because it kind of melts away while cooking.  I also reccomend 2-3 cans of pie filling.  This recipe is a good one, and 2-3 cans will fill a 9x13 so there is enough to go around.  I have tried it with cherry pie filling and apple pie filling.  Next on the list is blackberry.  I serve it heated with ice cream.

I made this in a serving size for 2 .... as I am often alone Monday-Friday. I was out of vanilla and almonds. I had almond butter, however. I substituted half of the butter for almond butter and added some chopped walnuts to the crumble. I also used 5-grain whole gran hot cereal mix instead of plain oatmeal and added cinnamon. I used a small ramikin and baked it in my tabletop convention toaster-oven-broiler using convetion heating at 400* for 20 minutes. Delicious hot AND Cold !!!!

Rated 4 stars because it's super easy, minus one star because it's not a particularly memorable recipe. But for busy moms, easy is often better than memorable.

FANTASTIC!!! Super easy to throw together and the ingredients are all common. Definitely adding this one to the mix of "go to" desserts!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what. The top crust was very dry & still kind of powdery. After it was done I added a little more butter to the top & baked it longer. It was better, but still too dry.

I made this with blueberry pie filling instead of cherry and I used whole wheat flour instead of white. It's really easy and really fantastic.

I made this for a vegan family member using vegetable oil and it turned out well.  I recommend reducing the cook time if using veg oil instead of butter.  Overall a great recipe!

I made this with my homemade cherry pie filling, made with cherries from my cherry tree, and it was excellent!  I didn't have any oats so I improvised, omitting the cinnamon and using apple cinnamon oatmeal.  Got rave reviews from my dh and kiddo's!!

My family and I absolutely love this recipe!  I like to make it in individual size tart pans and serve it warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  I've also made it with blueberry and apple fillings and it always turns out delicious!

TEN Stars! I put all the crunch ingredients on top as others recommended and it was Perfect! I can't wait to try it on other flavors of fruit filling also. I made this for Father's day and served it with ice cream on top. Everyone went crazy for it! It's one of the easiest & most delicious desserts I have ever made! The only addition I made was a splash of almond extract mixed in with the fruit. Next time I might use two cans of cherry pie filling for a more balanced ratio of fruit to topping, but it is great just like this!

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  It was so quick and easy to throw together but tasted like it had taken alot of effort.  I have since tried it using blueberry which I liked even better but my husband preferred the cherry.  Next, I plan on trying apple.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Timothy!

Made exactly as recipe reads except I used a bag of fresh, frozen cherries from Trader Joes instead of the cherry pie filling. I let the cherries thaw and used entire bag (3 cups). Was perfect for our family as it wasn't as sweet as I think it would have been with the pie filling.

I just want to say this turned out great!!  i made 2 of them for thanksgiving  the first one i made "as is" and i felt like it was lacking in some flavor so i took the advice of other reviewers: I added some nutmeg, about 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1/2 of a small can of crush pineapple (my grandma used to do that to cut the sweetness of the cherrys). And that took it over the top! I love the extra crunchy-ness and it's almost like a cookie bar and less like a cobbler!! mmmm delicous!

This is very simple to make and very good - we eat it warm over vanilla ice cream - as some one suggested I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the cherry pie filling and then sprinkled with one packet of artificial sweetener.

This is the best crumble/crunch/crisp dessert! I used a 16 oz. bag of unsweetened frozen cherries instead of the pie filling. It was excellent! I did not add an additional sugar. I can't wait to try it with blueberries. It held together nicely for left overs the next day (if you are lucky enough to have any).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty and very easy to make.  My husband and father-in-law couldn't keep away from it.  I baked mine in a 9" round cake pan and we cut it into pie slices.  Will be making again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

this recipe should be a basic in everybodys dessert collections, i like alot of the crunchy stuff so i made 1 1/2 times the amount of crunch, put half on top and 1/2 on bottom, also added the almond flavoring like another user suggested, i'll never have to look for another recipe for cherry crunch.

This recipe has become a favorite in our family. Even though I double the recipe, there is NEVER any leftover. I first discovered this recipe because I was looking for an alternative to cherry pie. I make all the cakes/desserts for family birthdays. My son much prefers cherry pie for his birthday. I am making it again this weekend. No birthday, just a craving for this amazing dessert. As a note of interest, my husband's favorite dessert is apple crisp. When I make this, he always says this outranks his apple crisp craving. LOL! Thanks Timothy S. Lindabury!

I highly recommend making your own cherry pie filling for this dish. I found one that uses honey instead of table sugar and it turns out to be a lot healthier of a dessert (haha). This recipe, however, is fine as is. I would recommend perhaps making another half batch of the crumble mixture and putting that on the bottom of your 8x8 or 9x9. Pre-bake that for 5-7 minutes, then put cherry filling, and the rest of your mixture. Makes for a more crunchy result with more crust (the best part).

Easy recipe that comes together quickly.  Nothing special, but great with vanilla ice cream.

I only had a half can of cherry pie filling so added about 1 1/2 cups fresh blackberries. Excellent!

Delicious! Sooooo quick and easy! I made it just as directed except: added a little extra butter, maybe a tablespoon or two - and I added probably a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the dry ingredients - and because I read other reviews, I put probably 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the cherry pie filling - not sure that even mattered. Served warm with vanilla ice cream on top - delish!!

Added vanilla to the pie filling and did not put the oat mixture on the bottom as others recommended. I was surprised that you could still cut it and serve it like a bar without a bottom crust. Delicious!

I made this almost as written, but I found this recipe while looking for something to use my leftover fresh cherries before they went bad, so I used those mixed with a some sugar, flour, and a bit of lemon juice to make it the consistency of pie filling. I also pressed the bottom layer into the pan and baked it on its own for 5-10 mins. It turned out as amazing cherry crunch bars. I'll definitely make this again!

I used margarine instead of butter, I reduced the sugar by 50%, and used fresh cherries mixed with a bit of jam - it came out awesome. And it held up well over a couple of days until it was all eaten.

This always gets rave reviews whenever I make it - if I share it, that is! It's so simple and delicious. I use 3/4 cup of instant steel-cut oats and 1/4 cup of rolled oats (it was all I had the first time I made it and it was so good I never changed it). I like to serve it hot, as is. My family likes it topped with vanilla ice cream. I've even made it with blueberry pie filling recently and that was a big hit too!

Forget the crumble they use. Get honey grahams, butter, cinnamon and brown sugar. Crush the graham crackers, put in the brown sugar add the fully melted butter and a healthy dose of cinnamon. Do the rest as directed.

I added 1 tsp almond extract  to the oat mixture,  used a little less then half of it on the bottom of the pan & baked for 10 minutes. I sprinkled sliced almonds on top of cherries before the rest of the oats & baked as directed. With vanilla ice cream it was probably the best desert I ever had with no soggy bottom!

Really good! Put bottom layer in oven about 5 min before topping with cherries and final crumb layer.  Mine was crunchy and delicious. Perfect with scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I've learned to always read the reviews before trying a recipe.  Baking the pressed down crunch for 10 minutes before adding the filling definitely created a solid and crunchy base.  My first attempt was perfect!  Next time I will try almond paste (also suggested in one of the reviews ).  Sounds like a good suggestion.

Recipe was basic; customizing improved it.  I used fresh frozen cherries but wouldn't hesitate to use canned.  Added some fresh blueberries to use them up.  Cut brown sugar for topping to 1/2 c. & added some slivered almonds, dash each: nutmeg & cardamom in addition to the cinnamon.  Cut butter to 1/3 c.*  Melted it in metal bowl before adding dry topping ingredients (subbed whole wheat flour for 1/2 of flour amount)  & stirred with fork 'til moistened.  *Some applesauce can be added if topping mix is too dry.  Used orange and apple juice for extra fruit liquid and to bring out natural sweetness, plus some almond extract  Used a little cornstarch as thickener.  Started baking at 375*, lowered oven to 350* halfway through.

I made this as the recipe instructed.  I am happy I read some of the reviews before putting it together.  I too noticed that the topping seemed very dry.  Therefore, I sprayed the bottom layer with Pam then added the filling and top layer.  I sprayed the top layer with Pam and sprinkled on some chopped walnuts.  It turned out fairly crisp.  Also added some nutmeg.  Yummy.

I was disappointed with this dish. My husband wanted something cherry so I saw this and figured I'd gice it a try. I made it per the recipe and it came out very dry. I think it has potential but you'd have to play with the recipe. Maybe start with adding more butter.

This recipe is just what I expected it to be, yummy.  The crust/topping was sweet and buttery.  I did use two cans of cherry pie filling, but next time will stay with the recipe and just use one.  A very easy, simple and tasty dessert. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

One of my fallback desserts.  If you're not thrilled about using prepared pie filling, drain the juice from a can of tart pie cherries and add a tablespoon of tapioca to the juice. Sprinkle the thickened juice over the cherries and then add the top crust. No additional sugar is needed; there's plenty in the crust. Chopped almonds are a nice addition, too. Wonderful warm with vanilla ice cream or yoghurt.

Nice, Since I have to watch sugar used Splenda brown, used half of the crumble and only put it on top.  I had some nice fresh cherries so I used fresh cherries with some spenda.  I also did this in ramekins for portion control.  This is a nice topping for all the fresh fruit you are able to get in the summer.

I took this to a cookout and everyone seemed to like it.  I had a can of blueberry pie filling so I made it with that instead of cherry.  The flavor of the oat topping was nice.  But it seemed a little dry and I think I'll use a little extra butter next time.  This is a great recipe to make when short on time and you want to take something nice for a gathering.

I've been using this recipe for a topping for over 30 years, however it is different using half a bottom layer.  I make it interchangeably with butter or margarine; and double the cinnamon doesn't go amiss either.
I also make the topping up and bake it by itself, and freeze for topping on any dessert or ice cream.  Great to have on hand.

Excellent. I've tried this as written, and the family loved it.  I've also used with apple pie filling (doubled)  and used the crumb mixture on the top to make apple crisp... That was also excellent!

I love this recipe. My Mom and I made this all the time when I was little and when I make it now it takes me back to a much easier time in my life..
 I do a couple things differently.. I add marion Berries to the cherry and also almond extract. On top I add a small handful of walnuts..

I didn't change anything except I divided it among 4 individual ramekins and baked it for about 35 minutes. Very good and very easy. In the 4 individula dished it stayed warm until after the meal.

Excellent!  The only thing I added (while it was still warm out of the oven) was a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  As other reviewers suggested, I did put the cherries on the bottom, then all of the dry mixture on top.  Very easy.  Very fast.  Yum!

This recipe is sinfully delicious. I made this about a week ago and couldnt believe how exquistie and flavorful it was. 

I did not use canned cherries, instead I bought frozen cherries and used the "Cherry Pie Filling" recipe also on Allrecipes. 

I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe for the first time, we're having it as our 4th of July desert, and I'll serve it will vanilla ice cream. My husband and I just had to try a small slice this morning, and boy was it good. The combination of oatmeal, and cherries, is so yummy! I'll be making this again, thats for sure.

I used instant oatmeal instead of rolled oats and it was less crunchy.  After baking I put a little more butter on top and broiled for 1 minute.  That gave me the crunch I was looking for!  Very good flavors; easy dessert and everyone loved it.  I can see using the different pie fillings or adding nuts.  I think next time I will add coconut because I think Cherry and coconut taste so good together and it would add to the topping.  A+ all the way.  It's a keeper in the recipe box.

This recipe is so flexible.  Did it with blueberry pie filling and it was excellent.  have done it also with lemon curd, apricot jam, strawberry jam - just about anything. It's a great quick treat to put in school lunches.

This was very easy and pretty tasty. My only complaint was that the crust was a little bland. I wouldn't make this for company, but it was a fast fix when I was in the mood for dessert without running out for ingredients.

I really liked the ease of this recipe.  I did adjust a bit by adding two peeled and chopped apples, tsp of vanilla drizzled over the cherry pie filling and a sprinkling of salt.  I also do not care for cherry pie filling without the help of say an apple....it is just too tangy for me.  I also cooked 55 minutes

this recipe works pretty well. i used homemade canned cherries - tart ones - and it turned out nicely. i love the topping, through. next time i might double the topping while keeping the cherry ratio the same. mmm!

Very good!  I made this as directed, except I used just shy of a 1/2 cup butter (7 T.).  I may try adding almond extract next time, as I think that would add that extra little something this recipe is missing.  Also, I would prefer this with more pie filling, so I might try adding another half can.

Made these last weekend for my sister's (who is vegan)birthday. Doubled the recipe and to accomadate the crowd at my house. Recieved compliments from all. Especially my twelve year old son whose exact words were "these are the bomb". I prefer them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to tone down the sweetness. Overall an easy, tasty recipe.

After reading other reviews suggesting 2 cans of pie filling, I realized I only had apple pie filling.  I used what I had & it was a great substitute.  My neighbors all came over for apple crisp ala mode & everyone enjoyed it.  I can't wait to try the cherry version next time. Good flavor & texture. Delicious. This will be made often.

What a lovely recipe!  I'm so glad I found it.  The easy factor of this recipe was spot on.  I'm only giving it a 4 star because the crunch part could've been crunchier.  I couldn't wait to serve tonite, so I had some nice and warm, and it's just to die for!  Thanks so much.  Next time, I'd recommend cutting back on flour a bit.  Maybe that'd give me the crunch I'm after. Man, it smells good.

This recipe is wonderful! I followed some of the directions left by other reviewers: I increased brown sugar to 1 c., Substituted 1/2 t. nutmeg for the cinnamon, since my husband's allergic to it, increased the butter to 3/4 c., and added 1 t. almond extract to the cherry pie filling. My husband loves cherries, and this is a keeper! Thanks, Timothy!

Very good recipe.  I used a 2 qt casserole dish and didn't need to add more cherry filling.  Recipe is perfect just the way it is.  Super easy and delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this after reading the reviews and made some fatal mistakes. I increased the crust ingredients to 1 1/2 cups oats, 1 1/2 cups flour and 3/4 cup butter. This made entirely TOO much crust. I baked the crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling (used blueberry) and the top crust; this didn't seem to make a difference in the end product. We also didn't like the blueberry flavor, maybe the original cherry or apple flavor would work better. Anyway, I won't be making this dish again.

I doubled everything, and put into a 9x13 pan. Really good and simple to make. It's the best served warm with vanilla ice cream over, but still very tasty otherwise.

Great recipe and very simple to make. I added 3/4 cup of frozen blueberries and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the filling. I also added fresh nutmeg to the crunch topping. Thanks for a keeper.

I followed the crunch recipe, and baked it in a 9" square pan using two cans of cherry pie filling.  The topping seemed a little too "floury" for me.  If I made it again, I may cut back on the flour, or add some melted butter.

This was good but would be better with two cans of cherry pie filling. There seemed to be too much of the crust/topping for my taste. The flavors went very well together, however.

This was awesome and really simple and quick.  I added a handful of chopped walnuts for extra crunch.  I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My son loved it. It made the house smell so yummy.  It made you hungry for dessert.  Thanks for the recipe will be a regular fall recipe. Thanks.

It was super easy but not super delicious. A little too oaty for my taste but my husband and son enjoyed it. I did think the crunch topping was a tad dry. I might make this again because it is so easy but I will alter the recipe a bit. More butter, less oats.

We've made this twice now, and it's my husbands new favorite.  Very yummy, quick and easy.  I do suggest doubling the "crunch" part though if you want a hearty dessert. Very good with frozen berries also.

This was very good especially with vanilla frozen yogurt on the side. The only thing I did differently was add more cinnamon(by accident) but it turned out great will definitely make again.

This is really good.  It closely resembles my mother's recipe for apple crisp, but the cherries added a pleasant tartness that combined well with the topping. Thanks! :-)

This recipe was so easy to make, and turns out beautiful! However, when I changed the servings from 9 to 12 so that I could put it in a 9x13 pan, I had to double the amount of cherry filling. I would definitely recommend that you buy two cans of filling, just in case. Also, some of the measurements got a little weird when I altered the servings too...watch out for that.

Wasnt very thrilled with this.  The oatmeal was the main flavor and I dont like oatmeal that well.  I think it may work well for a brunch type occasion.

If you have the pie filling, this recipie is great for a  last minute dessert.  
We serve it with frozen vanilla yoghurt, it's always a hit.

I used peach pie filling and it worked great.  Warm it with a little dab of ice cream and it melts in your mouth.

I made this for my husband and he loved it!  I served it warm with ice cream and it was a huge hit!  It was easy and inexpensive to make.  You can change it up by adding different pie fillings or even a cream cheese mixture.

We absolutley loved this. My 8 year old made it the second time we tried it. We tried it the 3rd time with the apples and did not enjoy it as much. Good recipe! Thanks
