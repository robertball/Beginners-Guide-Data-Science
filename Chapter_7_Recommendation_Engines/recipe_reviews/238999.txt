This was very good! I used some VERY ripe, fresh peaches that I peeled pitted and sliced, and that worked out great. I baked mine for about 20 mins. or so, and that was plenty, so keep an eye out. The combo of the peaches and toasted marshmallows work really, really well together. The kids tore this up! This was great for an easy dessert or even just when you want something sweet that's quick and more on the healthy side. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was looking for a quick treat one weekend but did not want to work at baking all night.  I ran across this recipe because I LOVE baked cinnamon peaches and it was perfect!  Quick and easy.  A can of peaches some cinnamon and marshmallows which I had all handy in my pantry and 20 minutes later I was in heaven.  Such an easy idea!  Thank you this is a keeper!

I was surprised how much we enjoyed this. The marshmallows were great!  I mixed the peaches with brown sugar, cinnamon, and old fashioned oats. Quick, easy dessert with pantry staples. Yay!
