I've had this recipe saved for a while and today I saw it was featured in the newsletter. I had all the ingredients on hand. It took less than 30 minutes to make it and that includes shredding the chicken. I subbed boiled chicken breast but I bet it would taste even better (if that's possible) with the rotissery chicken. I will be making this again and real soon!

I just made this and O.M.G. it is delicious!!! It was so easy to put together and quick too! My family loved it. We served it with a side of rice and a side of refried beans. This is going into my weekly rotation. Thanks for the recipe.

Served over puff pastry cups and sprinkled a little parsley over top for a great presentation.  Served with snap peas sautéed in a little butter & brown sugar.  Fantastic comforting dinner!

I would compare this to a Mexican chicken stroganoff.  Sill trying to figure out the difference in Mexican Crema and Sour Cream.  Couldn't tell any difference.  Would make this again with some changes. Oh by the way,  the 15 minute prep time is ridiculous.  If you add the pepper blackening time ( I would use my BBQ next time) cooling and peeling time it took about 45 minutes.  

I made it exactly to the recipe and it was way too spicy hot to eat and we eat Mexican all the time!  I thought Hatch Chiles were like a California Chili used in Chili Rellanos,  but they are more like large jalapenos.  My hands burned all night from peeling the burnt peppers.  I always use sweet onions but a neighbor had given me a regular onion which I used and that just made it hotter.  We ate what we with rice and chips but threw the other meal or two we could have had away.  

Will use 3  (not 5) Poblanos next time and a sweet onion and I think it would be very good.  Could add some cheese and more crema and it would make a hearty dip.

Made a couple of changes..
Because we like heat,added more chilie 
And
Used fresh corn.
Roasted corn  same as chilies then with a knife took off the kernels used instead of frozen corn.
Searved on tostada shells..
Super simple..
Was DELICIOUS..FAMILY LOVED IT

I used canned  Costco chicken breast. Instead of the creme I used plain yogurt for the creaminess. This was my first try with hatch chilies and will do it again. Also served it over tortilla strips.

My family really loved the recipe!  It’s not only super flavorful, but It’s  also a super easy to make. I did use chopped frozen green Chile ( about 7 relatively large spoonfuls) opposed to fresh and they came out surprisingly well.

SO delicious. I had pork on hand, so I browned bites of that in lieu of chicken. Also, I just use sour cream with a splash of milk.

Incredibly delicious. The peppers will stink up your kitchen. Grill them outside if you can. Prepare for a happy family. My daughter calls this my best dish ever.

I prefer a bit more chicken, a bit more chile, some garlic and some cumin. This would also make a great nacho base.

A delightful tasty dish with just bit of a kick. It’s thick and can be eaten alone, with crackers, as a salad. Enjoy!

This turned out quite well considering I had to substitute a couple ingredients. I can’t find hatch chilis anywhere so I used poblano peppers and also added a jalapeño from my own garden. I also can’t find Mexican crema but I did have a tub of marscapone cream which worked out just fine. I also made both salmon and chicken so I could have fish while everyone else had chicken. I thought maybe I would have to add some kind of spices to it for flavor but it didn’t need it. The peppers add all the spice needed and it’s nice and creamy. Will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS!  I used Whole Foods smoked chicken instead of rotisserie, { I like the smokey flavor ).  but other than that I followed the recipe.  I seriously wondered about the bouillon but it truly helps add flavor. I quadrupled the recipe because I was making it for 8 people and the family loved it! Some put it over Spanish Rice and some on corn tortillas.  I will definitely make this again.

We thought this was delicious, I served with street taco size flour tortillas, cilantro, sliced avocado, limes and the 2nd night with a little Cotijo cheese also.  I added a green salad on the side to round it out. I will be making this again.

I had fire-roasted hatch chilies in my freezer, just begging for a recipe like this. It was easy and very nice. I served it with guacamole and corn tortillas. While it was good for dinner, on day 2 I heated leftovers just a bit and spread them on bread for a chicken salad sandwich. Oh, my goodness! Perfect lunch!

This recipe is amazing.   I was skeptical at first but so glad I ended up making this.   The best part is that the flavors get even better when warmed up the next day.
