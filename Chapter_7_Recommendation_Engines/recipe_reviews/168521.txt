This is almost identical to the recipe my grandmother gave to me about 60 yrs ago (which someone liberated from my kitchen). Thank you so very much for posting this. A nurse friend had never heard of watermelon pickles and when I told her I was going to make them, she asked her Japanese grandmother if she had ever heard of them. The response was very enthusiastic ... "I haven't tasted them in decades ... tell June if she will send me a pint, I'll give her a pint of berry jam." You have pleased more people than you know.

Five stars just for putting this recipe up!  Thank you so much for doing so.  My great-grandfather would talk about having watermelon candy made of the rinds when he was growing up in Texas.  As a child, I always thought he was kidding me.  Turns out he wasn't!  I will definitly make this this summer and let ya'll know how it goes.  :)

WOW! so seriously yummy and sweet! worth the many days of easy work! If you are diabetic, watch your numbers as there is ALOT of sweetness! only thing I would suggest is for suggestions on easy ways to remove the green from the rind. I used ground cinnamon and cloves instead of whole, mixing it into the end day syrup before pouring into sterilized jars. had some syrup leftover which went on French toast.. SWOON! now I can call out with "grandma" , "bring me some watermelon candy"!!
