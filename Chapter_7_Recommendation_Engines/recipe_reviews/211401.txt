WOW ... 5 stars for a Brussel Sprouts recipe? Great dish. I prepared this for guests last night. I didn't know how they felt about B/S's so I prepared another vegetable side dish as well ... the Sprouts were GONE ..... everyone really complimented the flavor. As is typical I followed the recipe for my first time making it ... no sense in rating a recipe that you've changed!!! The only things I will do differently next time are: 1) skip the butter on top 2) put the bacon pieces on top, not mixed in 3) broil for about 3 minutes at the end. Try this recipe!!!

I have made this recipe for years and it has always been a favorite. I crumble the bacon on the top instead of mixing it with the sprouts. I also leave off the extra butter on top.

I have a favorite Brussels sprouts recipe that uses pecans and lemon juice but tried this one instead. So glad I did. I tweaked it a bit by adding carrots which I boiled with the sprouts, for color and because I like them! I added minced garlic to the cooked bacon in the pan and briefly sauteed before adding the vegetables. Also, I used gluten free breadcrumbs and less than half of the butter. Normally I don't cook with heavy cream and was pleasantly surprised when it created a creamy glaze that mellowed the flavor of the Brussels. Oh, and I added a good sprinkle of nutmeg with the salt & pepper. It came out wonderful and I'll be making it for Thanksgiving. Big thanks!

My store didn't have either fresh or frozen brussels sprouts, and I had my heart set on trying this recipe, so I used broccoli in place of brussels sprouts.  It was delicious.  My husband wants me to make it this way in the future, but I like brussels sprouts even more than broccoli, so I can't wait to try it that way.  Other than the broccoli, I made it exactly as the recipe called for.

UPDATE:  I made this for Easter using Brussels sprouts.  It was sooo delicious.  I doubled the bacon and mixed half of it in with the Brussels sprouts and sprinkled the other half to top of the bread crumbs and parmesan.

Made this for Easter and was very happy with how it turned out!  I tried it because I had made a zucchini gratin by Ina Garten that was delicious and thought this sounded equally good.  I did make a few changes, but think the recipe would be good as is too.  I sauteed frozen brussels sprouts in butter, then added some salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg, then the cream.  I put the bacon, bread crumbs and parmesan on top.  Will definitely make again!

Really great.  I actually used frozen (cooked al dente) brussels sprouts, since they aren't in season here.  I also layered the ingredients...I put half of the sprouts, half of the bacon, etc., etc., and just repeated the layers.  Everyone LOVED it!  Thanks.

Without a doubt, the best Brussels sprouts we've ever had!  I had to adjust the measurements slightly because I used more than one pound of sprouts, but other than that, I made no other changes.  My husband and I are fans of Brussels sprouts to begin with, and we both agreed that these were the best we've ever tasted.  Even my son, who usually rejects any veggie other than corn or potatoes, loved them.  I'm planning to make them again tonight, and plan to make them at least once a week--THAT'S how much we liked this recipe!

Out of 3 different brussel sprout recipes we've tried this week, this was , hands down, the favorite by brussel sprout lovers. Non-brussel sprout lovers didn't like any of them:)

This was good.  Some of the brussel sprouts got kind of mushy.  I'm not sure if I cooked them to long or if it's because I used frozen rather than fresh.  Next time I might try adding some more flavors like garlic or onion.

Granted, I only "tolerate" brussels sprouts, but I thought these were just okay, not great.  First of all, they were quite a bit of work just to add a veggie to dinner.  Second, what is the point of eating a veggie that makes you feel guilty?  They weren't really much of a hit with my kids either.  Guess we'll stick with little trees (broccoli) and forgo the alien heads (brussels sprouts).

This is great even for people that don't eat Brussels sprouts!  My kids love this, and it was a great thing to take to family function because it was different not the same old thing.  My only this was to add a lot more bacon, that's what makes this gooood!

Awesome.  Definitely worth the effort.  I added fresh carrots, and used turkey bacon.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  Worthy of company, worthy of family, worthy of eating alone on the couch while watching trash TV.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent for a Brussels Sprout dish I have some picky eaters when it comes to Brussels.  When asked whats for dinner the gross sounds came out. Truth be told.. My husband and daughter loved it.  Even asked if there was any left. This is the recipe to make for those who hate Brussels it will definitely change minds around your house.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have bacon on hand so I just sprinkled bacon bits on top and I omitted the butter. It didn't need the butter and it was delicious!

Thanks for the idea to start me thinking.  I used mushrooms, onion, crushed fresh garlic, left over chicken breast, and lite alfredo sauce from a jar.  We served it over brown rice...........yummy!

Thank you for this recipe. I made it last night and really enjoyed it. I didn't put the butter on top since it is a bit on the heavy side already and felt that this would be too much.

I made this recipe as-written on Christmas Day. It was easy and quick to throw together and into the oven. When I brought it to family dinner later, everyone thought it was wonderful and it seemed like a lot more effort went into it. My uncle is a chef, so getting his approval is always a good sign. My father, who hates Brussels Sprouts, had two servings. (Who cares if it was mostly topping!)
This recipe is too rich for every day, but makes a great dish for a fancier family meal. The leftovers were awesome.

We loved this dish.  Five stars for ingredients.  I quartered the sprouts after they were cooked, then tossed them in the cooked bacon, salt, pepper, half the bread crumbs and Parmesan.  Then I drizzled in the cream, then the butter which I melted.  Delicious way to serve these underrated veggies.  Please give them a try.  They will be on my table at Thanksgiving!

My family (husband, 3 kids) LOVED this recipe.  We normally cook brussel sprouts and put cheese sauce, but I think we will be doing this now!  The bacon and parmesan cheese with this recipe made it!  DELISH!!!

I love Brussels Sprouts.  I gotta tell you this recipe is superb.  I made it for the first time today and took it to a community Christmas dinner, everyone else loved it too.  Very yummy.  I did not take a picture because it 's not very photogenic , but delicious it is!   Next time I will make it with a bit more bacon and put it all on top with the crumbs and the parm cheese.   This dish will  beautifully accent  your meals.  Or it could be a  main dish.  I tripled the recipe and cooked it for 25 minutes at 400F  and then  15  minutes at 375.

Just tried today. Followed the recipe except I didn't have heavy cream so I used half & half. My family loved the creaminess of the brussel sprouts and the bacon added so much flavor. This is definitely a keeper. Will be adding this to my Thanksgiving menu.  Thanks for this winner.

Loved it!  I even "lightened" it by cooking the bacon in the microwave (draining the grease on paper towels) and using just a little bacon grease in the baking pan.  I substituted the 1/2 cup of heavy cream with 1/4 c. sour cream and 1/4 c. nonfat Greek yogurt cutting 80 calories per serving.  The best part, my kids loved it, too.

I happen to love brussel sprouts, but there's nothing great about the recipe.  I hoped it would be something I could serve during the holidays, but it's not up to par.  Steamed with a little bit of butter is perfect for me.  It's probably just the nature of serving brussel sprouts to non-likers.

I made this for Thanksgiving ( double recipe) and the grandkids, who usually hate veggies ate seconds. In fact the mother of my step grandson phoned for the recipe because my 12 year old step grandson wanted to have brussels sprouts, made like grandmas, for dinner. come Christmas I am quadroupling the recipe!

I substituted turkey bacon for regular because that is what I had on hand.  Very good side dish.

I have made this for years now, and it is always requested at Easter and Thanksgiving.  Usually we just roast brussels, but for special occasions, this is my go to recipe.  I usually increase the bacon and the amount of brussels sprouts called for, but otherwise follow the recipe pretty closely.

This was amazing! I did make a few modifications, which I don't typically do with a new recipe, however, I had some crimini mushrooms that had to be used up so I threw them in...and since I added the shrooms I also added a third piece of bacon. I forgot to put the butter on top and didn't realize it until it was almost done so I put a small amount on top for the last 5 minutes of baking. Can't wait to make these again!

I was looking for a vegetable recipe that my children would eat.  They both ate this dish without complaining.  I am very pleased.  I fried the bacon until it was crispy and put the crumbled pieces on top of the dish so the children could appreciate the bacon better.

AMAZING and tasty. I rated 4 stars because I changed the recipe because of my diet - no bread crumbs and sprinkled goat cheese on top instead of Parmesan. Also did not add butter - and messed up timing of bacon so I just added the Brussels sprouts to the bacon from the boiling water and sliced any big ones in the pan. Tasty, tender, sweet, and salty veggie confection! You will say hello to your heart attack with a smile...

I love brussels sprouts, but I screwed up and baked this too long so it was over browned and a bit dry.  Still the flavor was awesome so I will try again.

If you are not a brussels sprouts lover you may be after eating this recipe!  I'm giving it 5 stars because while I love brussels sprouts my husband doesn't.  He politely took a first helping and came back for a second helping.  Very tasty I will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a very, very tasty recipe.  Easy to do and you can make the brussel sprouts as soft or our favorite al dente as you want.  It's a definite keeper in our house.

I HATE BRUSSEL SPROUTS! But my wife loves them. I found this recipe and it peaked my interest. I did make some additions tho....I added some crushed garlic to the bacon and I used 7 pieces of bacon (I love, love, love me some bacon). The dish was phenomenal, I loved it momma loved it and it is a definite "do over"!
If you don't like Brussel sprouts but everyone else does then this is your dish! :)

This was an excellent recipe! I read through the comments first and used some of the suggestions - I cut the sprouts in half before I boiled them and I omitted the butter. As a side dish to baked chicken, this was perfect!!

this is tasty, only i think the sprouts should be cut in half first.  otherwise, they take a long time to cool off.

This was so good!  My husband doesn't like brussel sprouts and I was trying to find a way to make them where he might actually eat them and this was it.  The sauce this makes is delicious - I am going to experiment using it with other veggies too.

This was crazy good.  I found this recipe just a couple days ago and asked my husband how he feels about Brussels sprouts.  He was like eh I can take them or leave them.  I made them today and when he took his first forkful he made yummy noises.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I did use the double thick cut bacon, so I probably at least doubled the bacon.  It was so great, thank you.

Wow, just WOW!  Followed recipe but didn’t add the butter. We didn’t miss it at all. Loved it so much I bought more Brussels sprouts to make more (since I had the cream and cheese already). Bought two pounds and doubled the recipe. Definitely not the healthiest way to eat this vegetable but they have never tasted so good!  Will definitely add this to my “when we have company “ list of recipes and will most likely add it to my thanksgiving menu for all of the years to come.

This is my new go-to dish for potlucks. It really is a crowd pleaser. My husband, who doesn't care for Brussels sprouts, even has to have second helpings. I could probably have third or fourths! It's simple and so delicious. I do double the bacon, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Good recipe, however I wish I would have used two pounds of brussels sprouts instead of one pound, very small dish.  I used frozen Brussels, so maybe fresh are larger.

I've never been much of a fan of Brussels sprouts, but I liked this.  But the family members who do like Brussels sprouts were disappointed that this didn't taste enough like Brussels sprouts!  I use Morning Star Farms soy bacon instead of the real thing - crunchy and since they are stored in the freezer, it's easy to just use two strips and not have a bunch of leftover bacon that has to be used up right away.

What a hit!   Even the 10 and 13 year old gobbled it up.  Leftovers was the requested after school snack which speaks volumes for a vegetable.   For a lower calorie count, we swapped heavy cream with half and half without losing any flavor.  We also doubled the bacon because, well, why wouldn't you?   We made this with white aged cheddar that was on hand and loved it both ways.    The whole family rated it as one of their any day favorites but it's elegant for a holiday side two.   Win-win!   Definitely make this

These were great!  Did not use the butter on the topping and really did not measure anything except the heavy cream - used 3 slices bacon and simply sprinkled a small amount of crumbs and freshly grated Roma cheese over top.  Really enhanced the flavor of brussels sprouts - if you don't care for them, remember they are the main ingredient in this dish!

WOW.
Real sleeper of a recipe and good!
I subbed oatmeal for breadcrumbs, 1/4 lb pork sausage for bacon and 1/2 C chardonnay with ~1/4 C sour cream for the cream.  And I was a little heavy with the Monterrey jack cheese (no Parmesan)...  Aw shucks!

Nice change up to my usual roasted brussel sprouts! I used half and half in place of the heavy cream. The crust on top was yummy! I would make again for sure.

So I used cooked frozen sprouts & 1/2 & 1/2 - only 1/3c.  Tossed the sprouts w slightly heated 1/2 & 1/2 & maybe 1T plain breadcrumbs; then, added to the dish.  Topped w remaining breadcrumbs & the parmesan.  I thought I'd like & I did, but no one else was as happy.  :/

I loved this, but I gave only three stars because I changed quite a bit.  I sautéed the bacon and halved the spouts.  Instead of pre-boiling the sprouts, I added them directly to the bacon to cook them.  This makes a big difference to their taste and texture.  Then it was all seasoned and baked in cream and topping.  In the end, I don't think the cream added anything.  I would make this again, but my style.

Excellent way to eat brussel sprouts for a nice change from the usual. This recipe has less ingredients and is quicker to prepare than my other Cheesy Gratin of Brussels Sprouts recipe that I make once in a while. This one is just as tasty though. The whole family gave it 5 stars (they loved the bacon in it). I will be making this one again for sure. Oh, and my only change was using half-n-half in place of the heavy cream.

This dish is amazing! Even my eight year old who can be a picky eater asks for seconds! I've made this at dinners before for friends and one friend said, "I've never eaten brussel sprouts before and had no idea what I was missing!" That was a wonderful compliment to receive. It really is a great dish. One time, just to switch things up, I layered the top with slices of mozzarella cheese. Very tasty!

I just have to say, this is the BEST way to eat Brussel Sprouts if you possibly don't like them. My brother made this recently and I agreed to try it, even though I have a lifelong hatred for them. I have tried them Many different ways and have never been able to get more than down. This though, I Loved. I went back for seconds at dinner and the next day, stole some off my husbands plate when he was warming them up to eat. They are THAT good. My brother used Turkey Bacon instead of regular and it was great. Something about the cheese and bacon, cuts all that bitter Brussel Sprout taste and just leaves you with something yummy instead. I think I'll be making this myself and omitting the bread crumbs and adding extra cheese as I'm trying to watch my Carbs.

Good recipe...simple with minimal ingredients.  If you have nice small brussel sprouts, that is the key to your dish.  Larger ones are bitter.  Cooking method is good. Made for thanksgiving and everyone who liked brussel sprouts liked it.  The only thing missing was the need for more butter.  I doubled the recipe as I had tons of fresh garden brussel sprouts, but there needs to be much more butter to enhance the flavor. That's really the only missing element...otherwise there is no butter. I'd put 1/4 cup or so atop or mixed in with the cream.

I wasn't a real fan but it was edible and I'll probably make it again.  I think some spice will improve it.  Oregano?  Parsley?  Sriracha?  I'm not sure but the Parmesan is pretty overwhelming as is.

Loved the flavor!  I made a few changes.  I used frozen BS that I cut in half and sauted in Butter along with 1/2 a diced onion  for about 10 minutes.  I only had real bacon crumbles so added 1/2 Cup along with 1 Tbsp of minced garlic & S&P. I didn't have heavy cream so used Half & Half I added the bread crumbs & Parmesan cheese to this and then mixed it all into the BS & bacon. Put into greased baking dish and baked for 20 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

This is THE dish for people who don't run for Brussels sprouts at  the table.  It's very tasty and the added bacon really gives it a nice extra flavor.  I personally love Brussels sprouts but this was a great new way to make something different.  Loved it.

I was looking for some other way to serve brussel sprouts other than covering them in cheese sauce. I was a tad skeptical about my other half enjoying this because he loves his cheese sauce. No worries he ate his no problem, no complaints of missing sauce.  For bread crumbs I tore up a slice of buttermilk bread and crumbled it in my mini food processor. I thought I had fresh Parmesan but didn't. So I just sprinkled on the parmesan/romano from a jar. It was still great. I did add about a teaspoon of minced garlic when I added the  brussel sprouts to the bacon. I also was low on butter so instead of that I shook drops of toasted sesame oil over the topping before cooking. It added an awesome flavor and made me think to sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds over it all. Beautiful and delicious.

Omitted the bacon, substituted vegetable margarine for butter, and it was divine. I love the method of extended blanching the sprouts and then halving them. I've made other casseroles with Brussels and they are often unevenly cooked, so this was a good new thing for me!

These were easy to prepare and the first Thanksgiving leftover dish to be wiped out.  My mother, who has never liked brussel sprouts, said "You did it!  You found a way that I like brussel sprouts!" and got a second serving.  I did as others suggested - cut larger sprouts in half before boiling, doubled the bacon.  I baked mine much longer than directed, not intentionally, and they were still great, just really soft (which we liked).  The only thing I would do differently is the bread crumb topping.  It didn't crisp up, despite the extra oven time, so next time I will either raise the temp, dot with butter, or maybe even omit and add more parmesan (which is what I am leaning toward).  I am a mediocre cook, so if this is easy and successful for me, should be for just about anyone!

Basically doubled the recipe, in a deep casserole, so had to cook longer. Turned out awesome. Even the young kids who "hate vegetables" loved it. Thank you for this recipe.

My husband planted Brussels Sprouts in our garden this year and I am not a fan, so I was looking for recipes that could hide them a bit (so the kids might try it as well!) This was really good! I used evaporated milk instead of cream and still came out plenty creamy and rich tasting. Will plan on using it again next year if he plants more!

The direction doesn't say how long to simmer the sauce.  I let it simmer about 3 minutes.  The sauce did not thicken in baked pie.  It is very soupy.  If I make it again I will cook the sauce to make more like a caramel sauce.  Maybe add more flour.  I did not use granny Smith apple, I used the apples from my tree and they are very firm but this maybe effected the outcome.

I am a fan of brussel sprouts, but this recipe OMG it is THE BEST. I actually had to force myself to stop eating them so I'd have some for the next day! The only changes I made were to add 4 slices of bacon instead of 2 and I forgot the bread crumbs. Came out perfect! I'll be making this again. I might try frozen brussel sprouts to avoid all the cleaning & trimming. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

To save time, I cut them in half first, then boiled for 5 min, tossed into cast iron skillet, fat free 1/2 & 1/2, parmesan, 5 cloves of chopped garlic, garlic POWDER , 2 pinches of salt , 1 pinch red pepper, and bread crumbs. 400 F for  20 min.

Everyone at the cookout loved them, even those who said that they hate BS I saute' green onions and roasted garlic in butter and olive oil in a large skillet. Added the 2 pounds of partially steamed sprouts and cooked until they were soft. I then added blue cheese and bacon that I had cooked and frozen. Dumped it all in a prepared baking dish adding two cups of half and half since that is what I had on hand. And  topped with a mixture of bread crumbs and Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheeses .  It was a huge hit and everyone wanted the recipe.

Very good flavor, but the the Brussels sprouts came out a bit mushy.  I might cook this again but maybe boil them for less time or even zap them in the microwave which is what  I sometimes do to to partially cook other vegetables like potatoes when I’m cooking them further-like roasting potatoes when I’m in a hurry.

This was so good! we were having a meatless meal, so I left the bacon out and sauteed some onions with the Brussels sprouts. I seasoned them with some fresh garlic, salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg. I used about 3/4 cup cream and sprinkled on the cheese first and then a mixture of Panko and Vigo Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Everyone loved this. I'll be making this at Thanksgiving for sure!

I love creamed brussel sprouts, this puts it on a whole new level.  The only thing I added was a clove of garlic and I tasted at that stage, with the garlic and bacon grease, I could have stopped there and been happy.  Followed the rest of the recipe,  but added the bacon on top

Followed other reviewers suggestions to put bacon on top and skip the butter.  I did mix the breadcrumbs with bacon grease.  I also put Quinoa in so I could use it as a main dish, but the flavor was amazing and I don't think the Quinoa impacted that.

As a kid I really loathed these misunderstood itty bitty cabbages. But now that I'm a babushka, I appreciate them in ways I never expected. And it's the creativity and palette pleasing innovations of so many cooks here at AllRecipes which are a credit to my turning on this. 

This recipe is very adaptable to modifications according to what you may have on hand. For example, when I made this today, I had no bread crumbs, but I had on hand organic corn chip dippers from Trader Joe's which I placed into a bag and crushed into crumbs. I had no heavy cream, but I had CRÈME FRAÎCHE from Bellwether Farms which I diluted slightly with water - nice upgrade. So yummy and I had some Parmesan cheese choices, but I instead chose Mexican shredded cheese blend which I had on hand.

Trust your 'on hands' items and don't be a scaredy cat to try them. So glad I did that today in Brussels.

Was great, substituted the bread crumbs with hemp hearts, which made it gluten free and oh so tasty.

This is my first time making Brussel sprouts. These where delicious. My boyfriend and I had three servings. I was going to make a different recipe for the sprouts, but I ended up using this one. I am glad that I did. I added a bit more bacon, but I will definitely use this recipe from now on.

This was a nice change from plain steamed brussels sprouts.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 people, and made it in two individual ramekins. I did follow others' advice, and put the bacon on top, rather than mixing it in.
I had a half orange pepper to use up, so I chopped it and mixed it (not pre-cooked) into the pre-cooked Sprouts, which added nice colour and flavour.
I personally didn't find the heavy cream was a huge bonus in this recipe... will try it next time with buttermilk instead, as that might be just as good.

I thought they were really good and will make again, especially for the holidays.  A little more work, but most of it can be done ahead of time and it is worth it.

I made this as an attempt to get non-brussel sprout eaters to at least try them.  I consider it a win, because almost everyone had at least one bite.  

The only change I made was adding real maple syrup to the pan with the bacon.  Yum!

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was a hit. My only change was subbing cream for canned cream of bacon. I was asked to make it again for Christmas meal today and I used cream of celery this time. Pretty sure it’s another hit!

This recipe worked well even with frozen Brussels sprouts.  That and the ability to adjust the number of servings make this a very useful recipe to add variety to the menu.

Well, I was nervous my husband wouldn't like these, but wow, what a hit! I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream and Earth Balance butter to make it lactose free for dietary restrictions. Also, ended up omitting the breadcrumbs because I didn't have any on hand, but did add more parmesan cheese because I'm ok with hard cheeses like this. It came out perfect and was so good. The bacon and parmesan really made brussels sprouts go up a notch for us and we'll definitely make this again!

This is a delicious side and a great way to get my son to eat brussels sprouts. I wanted to make more than a pound (1 1/2 lbs) so adjusted accordingly. I also used a a mix of gratef Italian cheesed to give more depth of flavor. I was worried they'd become mushy since cook until tender but I removed from heat right when the fork hit the middle and immediately into ice water. They came out great! A nice change from my usual roasted brussel sprouts

Oh, my!  These were so good!  Serving size says 4, but it only made 2 servings for these Brussels sprouts loving people.  I’ve never been a fan of boiling veggies in water as they lose a lot of flavor.  I did it my way, cutting the Brussels sprouts in half, then steaming in a covered pot with a small amount of water in the bottom until fork tender.  Drained.  Then into the skillet with bacon grease.  To bring out the flavor in this dish, it really needs a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper.  I found the amount of cheese to be lacking.  I didn’t measure, but sprinkled enough cheese over the top to cover the sprouts.  Maybe close to 1c.  The first time I made this I used cheddar and the second time using Parmesan as stated. Either way, it was good and could be made with any flavor of cheese you like.  I omitted the breadcrumbs as a personal preference.  This recipe is a keeper and one I will make often.

This was pretty dang good. I added broccoli too because I thought they would go well together-and it did! I didn’t boil the Brussels sprouts beforehand because I like them crunchy. The only thing I did differently was that I added salt and pepper and garlic and used turkey bacon because we don’t eat pork! My husband and father-in-law loved them too!

I do this differently. I microwave the sprouts and bacon bits for a minute in a ceramic pie pan, then sprinkle with grated romano and pork rinds (ground in the processor), pour over the heavy cream and  bake. My favorite way to have them and quick!

I made this while on an Easter camping trip,  and it turned out perfectly delicious.   I followed the recipe and cooked it on the top rack of the gas grill.   Everyone who tried it went back for seconds.  Easy, delicious  and worth making again.

Delicious and simple. I substituted with turkey bacon and added a little olive oil to compensate for the lack of bacon grease. I'm sure this recipe is incredible with real bacon!

This was delicious!  I tweaked mine slightly due to what I had on hand.  I boiled the sprouts as stated and rinsed them in cold water.  I had precooked turkey bacon so after halving the sprouts I put them in the dish and sprinkled with salt and pepper.  I used a little over 1/2 cup of heavy cream and then used 1/2 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I then used 1/2 cup of fresh shredded Parmesan cheese.  I sprinkled my crumbled precooked turkey bacon over the top.  I baked for said amount of time and then broiled for 3 mind after.  I will make this again

We don't eat meat, so didn't include the bacon.  It was fine, not great, but fine.

So good! SOOOOO GOOOD!! Here are my modifications: I refuse to boil any vegetables so I sautéed them in the bacon grease until al dente. I also creamed together some cream cheese and the heavy cream. And let me tell you... it was AMAZING! I quadrupled this recipe for Christmas dinner and thought it wouldn’t be enough for 18 people, but there was some left. So it makes more than you’d think

Absolutely fabulous!  Made this for Thanksgiving dinner (2017) and the recipe couldn't be more simple to put together for a delicious dish!  Well worth pulsing a few slices of loaf bread for the bread crumbs instead of the sawdust dried crumbs!

First time the asiago I used formed a sort of cap.  Second time I made changes:  I cleaned and cut sprouts into 2 to 4 based on size and steamed until crisp tender (5 min), drained moisture from steamer and added right to bacon.  I coarse shredded asiago on top of 2 qt. casserole and mixed in gently with a fork.  Then I microwave melted the butter, mixed in crumbs & sprinkled on top.  Much quicker and very yummy!

Even my husband enjoyed it & he hates the thought of them. You can also use pancetta if you don't have bacon around. I also used panko instead of breadcrumbs.

When I served this to my husband, he loved it.  I stepped out on a limb today and served it to all my kids and their families.  It was a hit.  Because we don't really get into adding bread crumbs to dishes, I left out the bread crumbs and doubled the cheese.  Delicious!

I don't eat meat so I left out the bacon, used panko instead of breadcrumbs. I'll be making it again real soon, one of my favorite veggie dishes!

The recipe is very easy to follow. I loved it, but my 2 going on 3 year old wouldn't taste it. He's going through a phase right now, so hard to tell if it didn't agree with his palate or just being difficult.

This was my first time cooking Brussels sprouts and it came out great! I made it with the intention of bringing for lunch  but I could eat this for dinner too. I did everything by the recipe. I was wondering if potatoes would be good next time to give it some filling. Love it!

I melted the butter and mixed it in with the breadcrumbs and parmesian cheese before putting it over the sprouts.  It was fantastic and my guests asked for the recipe.

I love Brussel Sprouts so I tried this as a means to get my hubby and 6 yr old to eat them with me. This worked! I LOVED this recipe and they liked it okay. We used sour cream instead of heavy cream. I used turkey bacon instead of regular and cooked it in the microwave. I also used two bags of 12oz frozen sprouts and I could have gone a little lighter on the sour cream. Maybe I'll do 3 or 4 slices of turkey bacon next time too. I could eat this every day.

First time left out bacon because didn't have any and family loved it.  Made as written except for the bacon.  Made second time and used the bacon and increased everything else.  Family likes it better without the bacon. Only cooked sprouts 4 minutes so they wouldn't be mushy.   Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were excellent!  Family loved them.  Nice thing is I usually don't buy the larger sprouts (bigger than a golf ball), but because we par boiled them first, they turned out super - not tough or bitter.  Used Progresso Italian breadcrumbs also - I think it kicked it up a little.  Can't really say with all the extra ingredients it's a healthy side dish, but oh well!!  Would definitely do them again.

Great recipe for brussel sprouts. Not a 5 because it's brussel sprouts, not everyone's favorite veggie! Made it, just as written, for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it. The cream and bacon (who doesn't like bacon?) are a nice addition. I will definitely make again.

I was brave and made this casserole with 3 pounds of brussels sprouts for a Christmas eve open house for 34!
I also added carrots for sweetness when cooking the sprouts.
Fried up onions and garlic with the bacon.
Everything else just the same.
Even people who thought they didn't like brussels sprouts LOVED this recipe and asked for it.

This recipe is fantastic. I doubled it for our big family Christmas dinner. I really wanted to make Brussels sprouts but my usual recipes are cooked right before eating. I needed something that would travel well (1 hour drive) and could be reheated without ruining the dish. The only thing I changed was to cook the bacon as strips and remove them for cutting into small pieces, then use a paper towel to soak up the grease from the bacon  (but left all the good stuck on bits to mix with the sprouts). It is a bit of a heavier dish with all the cream, Parmesan, and butter; but even knowing it's all there it still didn't taste heavy. Decadence works well for a special occasion too. Great flavor and everyone loved it. I reheated it briefly in the oven before serving but would probably try a minute under the broiler too next time.

Took this to a potluck, and it was completely gone!  I didn't realize people like Brussels sprouts so much!  Everyone raved about it, even those who did not like this vegetable.

If you like  Brussels  sprouts you will love this recipie.  I have only two suggestions.....Increase the amount of bacon used and use fresh made bread crumbs.

Very disappointed in this recipe. I would have preferred just roasted brussel sprouts, the parboiling and baking resulted in overcooked mushy sprouts and the flavor was diminished.  I might try it again, but doubt it.

Our whole family loved this!  It will be in my recipes from now on. The flavor of the sprouts were not overcome by the other ingredients. It was so good, I ate the rest by itself the next day!!!

The bitterness was gone!  Even my family members that "hate" Brussel sprouts liked it.  I absolutely loved it.  I put a little extra cream and cheese in mind by accident but it was great!  Creamy and yummy.

Good recipe. My husband (who is not a veggie lover) said these were the best Brussel Sprouts he has ever tasted. I had a change due to ingredients on hand. I did not have any bacon but had some bacon grease so used about a teaspoon of that for flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I made this twice in the past week. Love, love, LOVE it!  The first time I made it for my husband who is not a Brussels sprouts fan but he liked it a lot, none of the typical bitterness of sprouts.  Made it the second time tonight when visiting my son out of state.  He also is not a fan but agreed these were good.  Both times I added the sprouts to the same pan with bacon and drippings, tossed, then added cream, crumbs, and Parmesan.  Since the bacon was plenty salty, I didn't add any extra salt or pepper and no butter. They were still great!  I used plain bread crumbs from a box the first time and Panko crumbs the second time. Both worked well and the Panko added a little extra crunch that we liked. Will definitely make again and again and sing its praises to anyone who will listen!

I made this exactly as recipe calls for except I doubled the recipe and used half panko, half bread crumbs. My husband doesn't usually like anything done to  his Brussels sprouts, but he said this was a "keeper" and we'll be having it again and again I am sure!

I didn't do the ice bath but everything else according to the recipe was done exactly.  I prepared an additional veggie dish just in case, but everyone LOVED this one best!!  I will fix again since it was such a hit.  Thank you!

This has probably got to be one of my new favorite recipes! Absolutely fantastic!! I looooove brussels sprouts as they are, but this was a fun new way to prepare them and it did not disappoint... could have made a meal out of this, alone. 

We did half a recipe, as there were only two of us. But I will definitely make the full recipe next time, as they were THAT good! The only thing we left out was the butter. With the cream, bacon and a Parmesan topping, it was plenty without adding butter. It seems like this would be REALLY rich, but it turned out pleasantly on the lighter side. The sprouts really soak up the other ingredients and it comes out to a perfect consistency that is really good paired with pork chops, baked chicken or steak. This would probably be a good way to introduce kids to a vegetable many are so picky and turn their nose up to. But we loved it and it is a keeper that will be made again in the near future!

Edit: I love this one SO much I have morphed this into a “full meal” sort of “casserole”! Annex the bacon & instead, slice andouille sausage into 1/4” pieces & replace the bacon. Follow recipe as-is with that one modification & this turns into an excellent meal! (For extra “hearty”, sauté some diced potatoes w/ the sausage.)

Loved this recipe. It was a big hit with my family, even one who swears he hates brussel sprouts.  I'm sure it was because of the bacon.  I followed the recipe exactly and don't think I would change anything. Will make again.

Very good recipe.  I doubled it and had to leave out the bacon to make it vegetarian friendly.  A little too rich for me (hence the 4 stars), but excellent flavor.  Next time I will probably use half and half and give that a try.  But definitely a great way to enjoy Brussels Sprouts.

my BSprout eaters LOVED this recipe, though i made it my own way.  my husband insists this makes it a whole different thing; here's what i did:  
i added long , kind of thin slices of sauteed walla walla sweets [onions, that is] to the general mix of veg, and i added almost half a head of crushed fresh garlic. i also  put a modest layer of shredded swiss gruyere cheese blend from trader joes on the top.  also, i diced a quarter of a gorgeous, large, juicy granny smith apple and laid the pieces down the middle of the top.  THEN i put on the bread crumb/parmesan/butter lump layer and baked it as directed.  i might also have added a couple more strips of bacon than the recipe called for, and used black truffle salt.  and a few dashes of lemon juice.  and almost a tablespoon of well-distributed black pepper.

i really really hate BSprouts.  so i will go to the ends of earth....OK, multnomah and washington counties to get nice ingredients that will massage the stinky taste (yes, i said stinky taste) out.  it came SO close to working that BSprouts made it into and out of my digestive tract via the normal routes!  and i didn't have to hold my nose [much].  PS:  i did NOT boil the sprouts first.  instead, i quartered them and sauteed them with the bacon and they came out perfect.

I will definitely make it again! I'm not a huge brussel sprouts fan and this was an excellent take on them as I am a low carb eater. and don't do the higher end veggies.
The main thing that I would change next time is cutting the bacon up. Other than that, maybe cutting down the breadcrumbs.

It doesn't take much for me to enjoy brussel sprouts, but my husband is another matter - and this is one time he really like them!  Didn't change a thing and I will definitely make these again.

Made it for Christmas dinner, even though I'd never made this before. How can you go wrong with great ingredients? It was a hit & 2 people asked for the recipe. I used 1.5 lbs. of sprouts as the side dish for 8 adults. Also had potatoes, cauliflower, salad & turkey.

We thought this was very good.  8 min in boiling water was perfect for 1 lb of sprouts and submerging in cold water probably made the great difference in texture.  I used less than 1/2 cup of cream and thought it was great.  I mixed the 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup grated cheese before spreading it on top of sprouts, then used just specks of butter on top.  I baked it is a 9 inch glass pie pan.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you.

Very good side dish for a get together.  I made for "Christmas Eve Steak Night" and my guests loved it.  I made ahead and put in the oven later (closer to serving time), and it worked out great.

Made it just as written and it was great .  My husband which told me NOT to have  brussel sprouts  really enjoyed them.  I did use precooked crumbled bacon bits , and it worked fine. No bitterness, just a great taste and something in this family, different and good!!!

Made this according to the recipe, and the result was wonderful.  I think it is important to use a premium bacon to get the best results.  All the ingredients combined to make my husband rave.  Looks like we have a new holiday favourite.

This year so many of my recipe sites had brussels sprouts recipes with bacon.  My usual way of preparing Brussels sprouts is to oven roast with olive oil and salt and paper but I figured I would try something richer for the holidays.  Followed this recipe exactly (helpful hint: 1 lb of Brussels is about 24 medium sized sprouts) and was very pleased with the results.  I will serve this again as a rich side (heavy cream! bacon! butter!) with my standing rib roast Christmas day.  Cannot give it a 5 star rating only because sprouts are so much healthier and very tasty oven roasted per my usual recipe, and I believe in eating tasty AND healthy.  As a nice splurge for a holiday meal, definitely 5 stars. :-)
Addendum: made this again for Christmas dinner.  Used 1/4 c heavy cream and 1/4c whole milk  instead of required 1/2c heavy cream.  Also cut the butter on top by half.  Still very tasty, eaten with seconds by a 5 yr. old and everyone at the table had another helping too.  Will make it the adjusted way from now on - also didn't have the uncomfortable queasy feeling that very fatty food can give me.  Very good recipe, and thank you.

Wonderful, even for non-brussels sprouts eaters!
We've made this one several times now since Thanksgiving, getting rave reviews every time.  I have made it exactly per the recipe and I have also tried it adding broccoli pieces to the mix.  It is scrumptious either way.   My best friend/neighbor across the street had never tried brussels sprouts, so I made the version with broccoli for her and her husband.  They have requested a repeat!  Made it for my grandchildren, ranging in ages from 4 to 12.  Every one of them cleaned their plates.  This one is a winner!  Will be making it again for Christmas dinner.  Thanks so much.
P.S. have also made it adding a tiny bit of Grand Marnier to the sauce.  This adds just an extra bit of zing.  However the recipe as it stands is a winner on its own...

It was wonderful and a hit both times I prepared it, but it takes a long time, frying the bacon and blanching the Brussels Spouts after coring them is very time consuming.  I've mad it twice, but won't be making it again soon, only because it takes so long.

We absolutely love this brussel sprout recipe. I skip the butter on top and this time I used prosciutto since that is what I had on hand. We practically lick the plate!

My sister who dislikes brusselsprouts, did in fact like this dish and thought it was done well and acceptable. My only miff was that the heavy cream curdled while it baked. The cream did nothing but coat the bottom of the pan. These were not 'creamy' whatsoever. I merely boiled them, covered them in bread crumbs and reheated them in the oven, essentially.  

Also 2 slices of bacon just didn't seem enough. I used about 10 slices of turkey bacon, which according to my sister, really helped make the dish. Also the Italian crumbs I used to give it a nice flavor.

I don't think the recipe was bad, but it did seem poorly put together. I'll probably make it again, but will tweek it.

This recipe is fantastic. Added a little nutmeg and garlic powder, but those were only changes. Two things to note for next time: (i) par boil of sprouts in advance per instruction, but it might have been a bit too long. (And I did do ice bath as well.) They were not mushy when done, but I would have preferred them to be firmer; (ii) related to first point, consistency was probably a little too "dry". It was not dry per se, but after the sauce sits a bit it was probably not as loose as I would have liked. I suspect this was because I cooked them a bit too long. They probably need to come out looking  a bit too wet, and then let them come together. We doubled recipe and did in 9x13. It had plenty of cheese and bread crumbs. For bread crumbs mixed plain store bought with panko and seasoned some - out standard version when  bread crumbs are called for, yields better texture. Then added a little melted butter to this mix before sprinkling on top. I think this browns better than just the butter on top as called for.

I didn't add the bacon and added the Complete Sazon with the green lid that is found in the Hispanic section.  I also steamed the brussel sprouts in the steamer before baking them.  My family loved this dish!

Fantastic way to prepare brussels sprouts. I added 1/2 lb of cremini mushrooms, which I sauteed first, otherwise prepared as written. Will make this again and again.

Full disclosure, I am NOT a vegetable fan.  Made this twice.  First exactly as written.  Husband and adult-child loved it, me not so much, thought it was bitter.  2nd time did it with shredded cheddar.  Very indulgent; I had seconds and ate leftovers the next day.

The recipe was vague at best. I had to add bacon fat to the bacon to coat the sprouts. Vague on what type of bread crumbs and baking dish. The cream didn't do anything for the 'gratin' at all. The crumb was too much and the cheese just crisped up. Best to use a shallow dish and mix the cheese in with the sprouts. Use no or very little crumb since it does nothing.

I used Panko bread crumbs and added an extra strip of bacon.  Wow! Delicious.  Will make again.  And again.  And again.

We normally roast brussells in the oven with just olive oil salt & pepper... but I wanted a recipe that would travel.  This worked well, I assembled in advance and baked at our destination. Very tasty and didnt get soggy. I drained most of the bacon grease before adding the brussells sprouts to the pan (didnt want the fat, but did want the flavor).  Also didnt put butter on top. Will definitely make again.

Made a second time for xmas dinner, entire family loved it!

Super delicious!...but how could it not be with bacon smothering it?! Easy to double for family gatherings, but the heavy cream pooled in it next time I'll use much less of it.

I've always hated brussels sprouts, but my husband loves them.  I decided to try different recipes, hoping I would find one I could actually eat!  This is the one!  They're actually very delicious this way!  Next time I'll try a different cheese; maybe Asiago.

I used "steam in the bag" brussel sprouts and steamed them first.  I followed all other directions, except that I left out the bread crumbs due to following a low carb eating plan.  It was amazing, and we will definitely make it again...our entire family (including two little kiddos) loved it!

Awesome Brussels Sprouts recipe! The sprouts with the bacon, cream, and cheese are just delicious! I also sprinkled in a little Greek seasoning mixture with the salt and pepper...really just wonderful! Ready now for the sprouts in my garden to be ready!

Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving. Just realized I forgot to add the bacon. (face palm) It was really good, but dang, the bacon would have been great. lol.  Everyone who likes brussels loved the recipe. It is best to use small brussels. Thanks for a great recipe.

I HATE brussel sprouts but after my mom just bought 2 bags I decided to look up recipes other than plain ol steamed brussels. this was actually pretty good. I think it would be better if made a day ahead so they can absorb the creaminess or maybe add more cream or even cut the brussel sprouts right in half. will definitely make this again

The first time I made this, my 12 year old daughter didn't want to try it because, you know, brussel sprouts, but she did and loved it!  She even asked me to make it on Thanksgiving!  I changed it a little by using chopped pancetta instead of bacon and fat-free heavy cream (my nod to my WW diet).  Got raves from my guests who were brave enough to try it since, you know, brussel sprouts!  Will definitely make this again and again!

This was great!  After reading a few reviews, I was ready to begin.  Usually, I'm not fond of brussles sprouts but I am learning it makes quite a difference in how they are prepared.  I chunked up half a lemon and boiled it with the sprouts to help with the bitterness and it added a lot of flavour as well.  To get the tasty bits off the bottom of my cast iron saute pan (bacon and 2 cloves of minced garlic), I splashed in a little pinot grigio and then tossed the cooked, halved sprouts in the pan.  After that, I followed the recipe as is and WOW!  Simple, fresh, delicious!!  Will certainly be making this dish again!
