I wanted to like this salad - it was beautiful and colorful and very easy to make.  My guests and I didn't like it, though.  I upped the amount of sugar and it was still much too sour for our tastes.

This is a delicious salad. I used cider vinegar in mine, and I wouldn't change the recipe a bit. The appearance is beautiful with the purple of the cabbage contrasting against the orange mandarins and the green flecks of onion. The sweet and sour flavor of the dressing is mellowed by the toasted pine nuts, which give the salad a depth and richness. Because I had some red cabbages left from my garden, I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and the sweet and sour dressing complemented the oiliness of the turkey and gravy very nicely. I will definitely make this salad again--especially for events when I want my dishes to be especially eye-catching.

Great recipe, I used dried apricots and walnuts instead of oranges and pine nuts. Also used cranberry/pear infused vinegar with blood orange infused EVOO. Turned out great!! Will make this again for sure.

I enjoyed this salad. I used raisins, walnuts, clementine, and grapeseed oil in place of cranberries, pine nuts, mandarin oranges, and canola oil because that was all I had and I needed a recipe to use up my red cabbage. Will make it again.

We made this salad for a family get together.  Everyone really loved it.   I used fresh clementines because they are so available.   I used rice vinegar & avocado oil because that is what we had.

YUM! This salad was wonderful.  I used 3 green onions and rice vinegar with fresh clementine oranges.  I could eat the whole thing.  It was crunchy, tart (from the vinegar), sweet, and nutty.  Oh - I also used mixed nuts since I didn't have pine nuts and forgot to roast them.  But this did not dissappoint.  Will definitely make it again.

I used apple cider vinegar and raw honey instead of sugar.  It was very good!  I would make it again.

What a uniquely delicious salad. I saw this and some helpful reviews in the AR magazine, which took this salad to six stars. I used fresh mandarin oranges, added some pomegranate seeds and added orange juice and some of the pomegranate juice to the dressing. We also added a mix of dried fruit, not just cranberries, but also goji, blueberry, and maqui berries.  Absolutely wonderful and so beautiful! Use shredded cabbage as written. I cut the cabbage into strips and regretted it immediately. I could have eaten the salad faster with chopsticks. Thank you for the recipe.

I am hooked. I made it twice this week. I used half a cabbage each time not to spoil any. I substituted the vinegar with flavored rice vinegar and added cashews as I liked the texture from the pine nuts.  Delicious!

I just made this and like it a lot. It's a nice change from coleslaw, and it's quite pretty as well. I used a bit more red cabbage just because that was how much I chopped up. I will definitely make this again.

Scrumptuous!  I used olive oil and walnuts instead of canola oil and pine nuts.  And I used apple cider vinegar.  But the amounts & all else I kept the same as written.  This is absolutely delicious!  And just one little green onion?  Right!  It's perfect!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This salad was a huge hit. It's the perfect blend of crunchy, tart, and sweet. I used two real oranges, and toasted almond slivers rather than pine nuts.

My group loved it! I used 1/2 red and 1/2 green cabbage. I used part hazelnut oil and only seasoned rice vinegar. Added to that was 1/2 of a squeezed lime.  I substituted dried cherries and added pineapple tidbits.  I also added chopped broccoli .  Very colorful and taste!  Using my food processor to shred veggies mad it easier .
