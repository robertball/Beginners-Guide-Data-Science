A very nice and elegant dessert.  The raspberry jam complimented the other flavors very well.

The crust was lovely and the recipe was easy to follow. I did double the filling because I love almond paste. I didn't use it all and had delusions of using the leftover filling. My only change was using thinly sliced fresh pears and free-forming the tart to look like a pear because I saw that on a baking show and was inspired.

Very good. Several steps, but easy steps. Love the almond and raspberry favors.  Pears are pretty good with it- favors blend well.  I didn't have a tart pan, but instead used a 9 inch springform pan, which worked perfectly. Loved that this dessert isn't heavily sweet, just right.

We really enjoyed this and surprised how hard it was to keep hubby's hands off long enough to take a picture. I used raspberry jam and even served with vanilla bean whip cream.  This will be made again and even plan on trying with other fruit combinations.

This was an easy dessert to make and was very pretty when done.  I liked the pear with raspberry preserves and almond together.  A nice light combination.  I used canned LIGHT pears, but wouldn't do that again, as I missed the sweetness.  There's not much sugar in this recipe, so if you like your dessert sweet, adjust accordingly.  Overall a very nice treat!

This was very delicious and my family loved it!  I made a few small changes to the recipe;  I cut the pear halves into about 3 or 4 slices and arranged in a spiral shape on top of the filling.  I think it made it look more attractive that way .  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar over the top.  This was super yummy and impressive looking!

This was my 1st time making a true tart & the crust was excellent. I also enjoyed the almond paste baked part and the jam. I did not like the canned pears in this - I don't now what, if anything, I would change for the future. Maybe fresh pears I poach myself, I don't know. Maybe just eliminate the pears entirely, it's really good with the shortbread crust, raspberry jam, and baked almond (frangipane) filling alone. Thanks for sharing!

This is an easy to make, elegant dessert.  The combination of raspberry, almond and pear is amazing.
