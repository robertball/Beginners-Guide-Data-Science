Flavor is good and this turned out good but I made one change in the execution. I mixed the garlic, chili powder, and cheese in a bowl together prior to sprinkling it over the popcorn. I recommend doing this so that the flavors are even throughout instead of  getting a handful of chili powder here and and a handful of parm there.
