Wow delicious! I did lightly saute the red/purple cabbage and carrots in sesame oil and enjoyed this recipe warm with the light crunch rather than the hard crunch. I loved the flavour of the sauce. This is a definite repeat and would highly recommend.

This was excellent! I did end up doubling the vinegar for our liking but we like things a little more tart than most.  This was healthy, fresh, and very pleasing to the eyes. I highly recommend it!

I made this for a BBQ get together with friends, everyone loved it!
The only big change I made was to add in fresh Arugula and julienne the carrots.

Fantastic salad! I didn't have sriracha sauce so I used another hot sauce and I also used Keen's dry mustard instead of the one the recipe called for. I can only imagine if I did have all of the exact ingredients how much more amazing this salad would be.

I love this recipe!  Iâ€™ve made it several times for various groups and it always gets rave reviews. I use frozen soybeans. Other than that I just follow the recipe , which is unusual for me.

I've never written a review, although I have found some great recipes on Allrecipes...  This one was so good though, I had to rave!  I only had red quinoa, so I used green cabbage for the color contrast, and I substituted frozen peas for the edamame (I can't eat soy).  It was absolutely delicious just as it was, and you could add really any other veggies that you like.  The dressing paired with the flavor of the quinoa gave it almost a nutty taste. Yum!
