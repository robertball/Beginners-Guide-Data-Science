This is great....except I did something alittle different, I chopped the green onion the bacon and the mushrooms into tiny pieces and stir fried them all together then mixed them into to the meat.

I cooked 5 pieces of bacon and the flavor of bacon was perfect. I used fresh mushrooms and cut them thinly, kind of small. I added white onion, finely finely cut up. I also added a TSP of bacon grease to the meat.

The burgers were pretty good, but I couldn't taste the bacon as much as I would have liked. Next time I will have to add more. Thanks for the recipe, though.

This is a really good burger recipe.  I also added chopped sundried tomatoes to the mix for a kind of BLT thing.  So good!

These burgers were fantastic, we totally enjoyed these! The only difference was I added a thick slice of cheddar cheese, turned out great too! Quick and simple recipe. Thanks!

Super Good!! Im not one for keeping canned mushrooms in the kitchen so instead I sauteed a package of fresh mushrooms with a touch of bacon grease. Grilled on a George Foreman grill and it was perfection! Usually I find hamburgers dry but these were moist and filling. THANKS!
