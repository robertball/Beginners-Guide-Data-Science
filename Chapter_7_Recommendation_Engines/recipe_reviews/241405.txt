Always check your GF flour mix. Many now come with xanthan gum mixed in. You won't need extra if so.  The big problem with the recipe is the frosting.  With an ounce of whiskey and only one cup of sugar, you won't have frosting, you'll have soup.   Cream cheese frosting is usually 3 to 4 cups of powdered sugar, not one.  If you try and frost your cupcakes with the frosting as described, you'll get goo that runs off the top of the cake.   Keep adding sugar until your frosting firms up. (between 3 and 4 cups)

The only good thing was they were fluffy and moist!  I would use this for a chocolate  cupcake omitting whiskey and bacon, adding a bit more sugar.  Where did the 5 stars come from!
