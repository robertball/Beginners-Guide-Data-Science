I made this and added some green onion, bay leaf, and lemongrass. I also added a fried egg. I think this could be some new comfort food.

Yummy! I cut the hot sauce and ginger in half and used rice noodles I had on hand. Great as a soup or just the noodles.

Very simple & easy recipe....the broth is very good. I added mushrooms  & scallions and used Chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Next time, I'll add chicken!

Tasted pretty watery so we added some chicken boullion. Of course it was no longer vegetarian, but it was much more flavorful. Also, maybe a bit less ginger.

I might lower the soy sauce slightly just for personal preference, but this is a great broth for ramen style or many other types of noodles.

This recipe is spot on - with the benefit of being able to not only know exactly what went in, you can also add just about anything to it! Will save this always
