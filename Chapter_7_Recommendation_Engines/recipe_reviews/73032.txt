Hi, I posted this recipe.  I just wanted to let you know the ingredients I use because reviewer "Annie" gave me 1 star because she is having troubles getting it right.  I start by buying the best (most expensive) yellow popcorn kernels.  Cheaper brands don't pop well.  I use Pure Wesson Vegetable Oil and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to cook them in.  Then I top it off with Lawry's Seasoned Salt (remember not to add too much).  I hope that helps Annie.  When you get it to work I hope you come back and update your review.  Thank you and enjoy!

Soooooo easy and delicious, no need to microwave ever again!  But!  Note that this popcorn can be made really successfully using the same method but with only 1 T of canola oil and 1 T of margarine (I use Smart Balance), the salt will still stick just fine and the fat is cut down a ton.  Have fun!

Believe it or not there is a trick to this for those who are afraid of burning the popcorn.  Only add 3 kernels to the oil first and when all 3 pop then add the rest of the unpopped kernels.  
Make sure you shake well so that it is in motion.  We also like to add the butter oil that you can get at the grocery store.  Delicious and the paper bag gets rid of the extra oil that usually deposits at the bottom of the bowl.  I REFUSE to eat microwave popcorn again.  Delicious.  Thanks for the post.

This was absolutely delicious! The oil and butter combine to make a perfectly seasoned snack without being greasy. We used to make air-popped popcorn and drizzle on melted butter -- tasty but greasy. Then we switched to microwave popcorn -- easy and quick, but it always has a weird, artificial taste (you know what I'm talking about -- that strange coating it leaves in your mouth).

Then I decided to get back to nature and found this simple recipe. Being raised in the days of Jiffy Pop and progressing to microvwave popcorn, I never knew it was so simple to just make popcorn in an ordinary pot.

This was so easy --popped up very fast (I just listened to the pops and took it off the stove when popping slowed), very tasty, and virtually no unpopped kernels. If no brown paper bag is handy, no problem. Just put the popcorn in a bowl lined with a paper towel. I'm going to experiment with using smaller amounts of oil and butter to see how lean I can make this without sacrificing taste. 

I really like the flavor and texture of this popcorn, and I enjoy serving a fresh snack without the preservatives, artificial flavorings, colorings and chemicals that are found in packaged microwave corn. I'm never going back!

Try adding the salt in with the oil, margarine and popcorn before popping. This is how we do it and it's popcorn is the best!!!

This reminds me of the popcorn we
used to take to the drive in when I
was a kid. Good to have once again to
have my kids experiance it, too. 

We had a movie night, popped this 
popcorn and camped out on the living
room floor. We had a blast.

Thanks for posting this recipe.

Great recipe-I have made this recipe for years, since I was a kid.  The only addition I have made is shaking parmesan cheese on it as well (use less salt) - delicious!

I've made this recipe a few times now, and it's really easy and tasty!  I would DEFINTELY recommend reducing the salt.  It's way too salty as is, but this is just a personal preference.  Also, I didn't have any margarine the first time I made it, so I used two tbls of unsalted butter and this was pretty good also!  I've since tried it with margarine, and I prefer the butter, but both are good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Love it! As a kid, we made air popped.  I quit buying my husband microwave after health rumors.  This reminds me of my first job at a movie theatre.  I also did the canola/smart balance suggestion.

This popcorn was excellent.  I have been making microwave popcorn for awhile now but I may stick to the old-fashioned stovetop popcorn from now on!  It tastes more like what you get in a movie theater!!!  The bag is a great idea to mix it all up in!!!

Super tip, I think the best way to prepare popcorn, very yummy and buttery flavor. Less oil and margarine can be used, the secret is that the oil/margarine need cover the popcorn, excellent! thank you!!

Mmmm...best popcorn ever!! And putting it in a paper bag was a great idea. It creates easy clean up plus absorbs some of the oil. We will use this recipe again and again.

This was an excellent way to pop the popping corn I got in my CSA box! I used vegetable oil, butter, a bit of salt, and a bit of sugar. Incredibly yummy!

Yum Yum ! I agree with using FRESH kernel popcorn (vs. stale popcorn that has been sitting on your shelf- makes a big difference)-  I omitted the butter .. but did everything else the same. OMG, I can't stop eating it.. You will never go back to the microwavable bags!

I grew up on stove top popcorn and we always took it to the drive-in in brown paper grocery sacks! We make stove top popcorn all the time for school snack and work, as well as home. My family feels that Corn oil gives a better taste than canoloa oil. And the author is correct, cheap popcorn tastes poorly. The higher quality popcorn does taste better.  Depending on the thickness of the pan, you may need to turn the heat down towards the end of popping.

This is almost exactly how my father used to make us popcorn when we were little. Once in a while I will make popcorn for my kids this way. Tastes better than microwave popcorn and brings back great memories.

Great popcorn. I added some garlic seasoning to it though, just because :) It was also my first time popping popcorn using a stove, since I usually microwave mine. The popcorn was delicious and I added a bit more season salt. I still like microwaveable butter popcorn but this works too!

Listen, this is the "bomb", as my daughter says when she loves something!!  
Five stars for this great family-time popcorn recipe.  I don't think anyone has ever had the idea to add a popcorn recipe and I am so glad you did.  
To the others who fear using butter, remember this, margarine is ONE MOLECULE FROM BEING A PLASTIC!!!! And also ladies, the five best foods not to avoid include "BUTTER".  DON'T FEAR  BUTTER!!
BUTTER IS OUR FRIEND, MARGARINE IS "NOT" OUR FRIEND, BUTTER IS NATURAL, MARGARINE IS NOT.  
USE BUTTER INSTEAD OF MARGARINE, IN MODERATION...ENJOY!!

Perfect, thank you!  Eye-balled all amounts, used store brand kernels, and was still perfect.  The secret was to keep moving.  Thank you for this.

Good.  Simple.  Probably how people used to do it before microwaves.  Probably only takes an extra minute or two as well.

This is an excellent recipe.  I've never tried to make popcorn on the stove before and I was very glad to find a recipe that explained how simple it is.  I recommend medium-high heat and to preheat your pan first adding the oil and butter in immediately before adding in the kernals.  Spice things up with pepper or herbs or some Parmesan cheese.

This popcorn is sooo good!  I would concur that you should use a good kernel to start with as it will make a world of a difference in the results of popping.  I can't get enough, that's how good it is!

This recipe was excellent.  Cheaper than the microwave kind.  I did a blind taste test with my family and this popcorn won every time over the microwave brand.  Instead of the paperbag, I put paper towels in a large bowl.  I also use a large stock pot & lid to better contain the popping kernals.

Oh my goodness, so love the name of this popcorn recipe.  Even though my mother made something very similar to this, my 4 siblings and I would go to the drive in movies with my dad with a big bag of popcorn in a brown paper bag ,all of us kids fresh from a bath and in pajamas! I would also name it MOM"S NIGHT OFF popcorn LOL!!

I used butter in place of the margarine and canola for the oil. The first time I tried cooking it, I ended up with complete disaster--burnt popcorn and a house full of smoke, so the second time I took a more patient approach and turned the heat down to medium high. The result was fantastic, and I'm not even a popcorn lover! (my husband and two-year-old are) We tend to like things on the salty side, so we added a little extra regular salt. I can see that there's definitely a little skill involved in making popcorn, so I'm glad I tried twice. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! No name brand ingredients necessary. I used generic oil, generic popcorn, generic salt and generic margarine and it turned out perfectly. I did follow LOLLEYBAUER's suggestion of adding the salt to the oil/margarine mixture before adding the corn...nice touch btw. No more store bought popcorn for me!

Yummy!!!  Sorry microwave bags but no more for me!  This reminds me of the homemade popcorn my grandmother made on the stove.  My cousins and I would beg her to leave the lid off a little longer so we could try to catch the flying kernels.  I am not used to this much oild/margarine so I might try the reduction suggestions mentioned by others.

I grew up making stove top popcorn.  It was always so exciting when mom would get out three paper bags to fill with popcorn.  My four sisters and I would take turns being the one who held the bags open for her. While another was encharge of pillows, another had blankets another had kool aid and so on. Dad would open the back of the station wagon and we would all pile in. Off to the Drive-In Movies we went .A car full of five excited little girls and the yummy smell of popcorn. Drive-In Movies are almost a thing of the past but I think of that every time I make popcorn.  With one of my daughters holding the bag and the other getting the blanktes and my husband putting the DVD in.  Makeing Memories.    Thanks for thinking of putting this receipe up so others might enjoy it with their family and friends

better than "movie popcorn"!  Thanks for the tip of adding butter to the oil-never did that before and made a huge flavorful difference.

I love making popcorn like this. One tip I have is to use med-high heat (about 7 out of 10) instead of high heat. This makes the popped kernels fluffier and less condensed.

I need to take exception to one review which recommended using 1 T Canola Oil/1 T Smart Balance to 1/2 cup kernels.  This ration burned the bottom of my pan black and created a huge amount of smoke and of course blackened the popcorn. After experimenting I found the correct ratio to be 4 T Canola Oil/ 4 T Smart Balance to one half cup of kernels. Popped to that ration the popcorn was excellent.....

I've made this probably 10 times now. It is super easy and delicious. We were using Orville Redenbacher popcorn. Wife just bought some store brand popcorn kernels and there's a BIG difference in quality. I highly recommend that you pay the extra dollar or two and get the good stuff!

This is how my family has always made popcorn, it is delicious!  We make a big batch and put it in a brown grocery bag like in the picture and take it with us to the drive in theater in our town, the kids love it and so do I. (I also use real butter)

I read the reviews to this while munching on a bowl of popcorn I had just made, with very similar ingredients and method.  I tried the seasoned salt...different.  I too remember being a kid, dumping fresh popped corn into a big paper bag, piling into the station wagon, and then off to the drive-in movies.  Good times!  When I made this tonight, I put about 1 Tblsp butter in a 2 qt pot, melted the butter on very low, skimmed off the foam, cranked up the heat with a couple kernels, and when they popped, I added enough kernels to cover the bottom of the pan in a single layer.  I covered and shook while they all popped.  Dumped this into a bigger pot lined with paper lunch bags (all I had), sprinkled on the seasoned salt, covered with another lunch bag and pan lid and shook real good.  Tasted...needed more salt...did that...shook more, and...finally...got it.  I'm going to add the salt to the butter next time.  Might try maple syrup?  I read that somewhere...  This sure does beat microwave popcorn, but you can't beat the convenience of those bags when you're at the office and you have the 3pm snack attack!!  Thank you for posting your Daddy's Popcorn recipe11  :)

Took me back to my childhood watching the weekly Disney movie with my family.  Thank you for a terrific recipe.  My girls loved watching this pop through the glass lid on the pot.  They say they only want this kind now in place of the microwave variety.

WOW! I have been strictly microwave for years now, but wanted to make our own for the kids to try, and I know I picked the right instructions here! I didn't actually measure the butter(well, country crock) or the salt, but everything came out great. Thanks so much!

We have made our popcorn like this since I was a kid; but I can't convince myself to use a grocery bag...after all you've had groceries in it which have been touched by countless hands (and no I'm not ocd!!). I recently started popping corn as per microwave popcorn from this site and no more big pot or shaking for me!

Terriffic recipe! I have been making making stove-top popcorn since I was young (30 out of 41 years).  I find that the salt issue is just a personal thing - I like seasoned salt, the kids don't.  Hard to belive people don't make it this way instead of the "easier" micro style junk.

Terrific recipe!  I used the tip of one of the other reviewers to add 2 or 3 kernels in the oil and add the rest when they pop.  We get perfectly popped popcorn every time.

Just ran across this recipe and it brought tears to my eyes....this is exactly how my daddy popped his popcorn and even put in the paper sack with the top cut off. I lost my dad when i was 16. He taught me to make popcorn this way..Thank you for bringing back such memories. I am going to go out and get some popcorn today..

I rated it a one only because I can't get it right.  I have tried three times to make it and I can't get the corn to pop well and it burns.  Seems to be greasy as well but that is probably because of the way it is popping.

One suggestion I have --
After the first kernel pops, remove the popcorn from the heat for 1 minute.  This will allow the popcorn to roast and darken.  Return the popcorn to the heat and follow the rest of the recipe.  I love the 1/2 popped roasted old maids.

I admit I was leary about this recipe before trying it but after making it and then not being able to stop eating it....delicious!! I did try it with butter and am sad to say that it didn't taste as good so just use the margarine!!

Thanks!  The popcorn was so fresh tasting.  I also used smart balance instead of margerine and reduced it to 1.5 Tablespoons.

I am a seasoned cook but popcorn is the one thing I have never tried making on the stove.  I had a bag of kernals and decided to try it.  Your recipe is so much better than whats on the back of the kernal bag.  It turned out perfect!!!!  Instead of seasoned salt if you add a little salt and sugar it turns out just like kettle corn!  Wonderful, economical, easy and just plain great!!!!!!!!

This reminds me of home.  Mom always made popcorn and dumped it in a paper sack and took it to football games.  However, I prefer making this with peanut oil vs. vegetable oil.

Delicious! I just used the store brand yellow popping corn, canola oil and butter. It came out delicious and basically all but 8 kernels popped! I will definitely be using this recipe again. I want to experiment with different flavoring options. It was easy!

Very good! I used butter instead of the margarine once and found that, with butter, it tasted better after the popcorn sat for a while.

Fantastic! This is how my Daddy made popcorn too! He never measured anything so occasionally the popcorn was a hit and miss! The measurements, pan size and timing were right on! Thank you for the detailed recipe information! I used vegetable oil and butter and it turned out beautifully. WAY better than the chemically stuff you get from a microwave bag!!

Great recipe (& easy clean up!) You can make this better for you by substituting coconut oil.  (Don't worry - you don't taste any coconut flavor) but coconut oil is much better for you! I did this and it turned out perfectly!

I only giving this 5 stars because I have stir popcorn maker and its about the only way to have popcorn.  I have not tried season salt but will try it.  I use to save bacon drippings and use that instead of oil,  That is OMG yummy.  I have used all kinds of spices,  garlic salt cinnamon Parmesan cheese chili powder.  what ever strikes my mood.  Poured caramel chocolate marshmallow.
Be creative.  try a small bit first to see if you like it.   I make a huge bowl left overs go in sandwich bags for lunches or I toss it out for the birds 
by the way use real butter margarine makes it melt and its nasty

Making your own popcorn is quick, easy and economical. I prefer butter to margarine, but I use heart-healthy canola oil or olive oil, so I don't feel so guilty. Serve with Junior Mints.

My Dad used to make popcorn like this when we were kids and went to the drive in movies. I made it a few times now and find it still works best to put it all in the pot at once and just keep shaking to keep from burning. Go light on the season salt and just cover the bottom of you pot with the vegetable oil. I tried the few kernels until the popped but when I dumped the rest in the oil splattered really bad all over the place, so be careful with that.

Simple and straight forward, the seasoned salt give a bit of a twist to standard salted popcorn.  We agree with the submitter that stove-top popcorn is so much better than microwaved.

I didn't give a five because my usual recipe for stovetop popcorn comes out lighter in a 6qt. pot, I think because the larger pot allows me to open the lid every few seconds to release steam. The 2-qt. pot size in this recipe is wrong; I used a 3-qt.  and 1/2 cup of popcorn still lifted the lid. Although the popcorn was relatively tough, it did have a good flavor. I plan to try adding butter to my cooking oil next time I use my big pot.

The only way to make popcorn.  Have been making it in a pot on the stove since I was a small boy.   I will have to try adding the margerine.  I like to use chili oil to pop in, then just a touch of salt.   Awesome!

Great, but i prefer butter. but take care, butter burns faster then margarine. As for a paper grocery bag, I haven't seen one of those in years...  LOL. A paper towel lined bowl works fine.

This is the best.  Tried microwave, but nothing beat this way of popping. I use 3 tablespoons of canola oil instead of 1/4 cup.  I give a sea salt grinder about 4 twists after popping. Then shake it to distribute.  For me that is enough salt and lets me taste the corn.

this recipe reminds me of the way my dad made popcorn.  the way popcorn should be made and taste.  none of the waxy microwave popcorn  yuck!! the first time i made popcorn on the stove for my husband he looked at me like i was nuts..  he at almost the entire bowl.  he couldnt get over how good and crispy it tasted.   once the popcorn starts popping you have to move the kettle constantly.  i mean constantly.  i do tend to use less oil then recommended and i use real butter.  i never buy the expensive popcorn it to me always seems stale.  we have local popcorn company and its great.  large corn and never stale.  i have also used jiffy pop and it works fine.  thanks for the keeper.

MMMMM... we love this at home! So much better than store bought, and a little goes a long way. For my family of 6 (2 adults and 4 children) 1/2 a cup of kernals is just right!

Like most of the other reviewers, I think this is a terrific recipe.  The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is that, even with reducing the oil/margarine by nearly half, the popcorn was still a tad oily for my husband's and my taste.  We're going to try using 1 1/2 T oil and 1 T margarine next time to hopefully get the optimal texture for us.  That being said, the popping technique is terrific--not a single burned kernal.  Best of all, no icky microwave popcorn smell!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I LOVE popcorn, especially stovetop made popcorn, and I LOVE this recipe! I have always just used oil, never margarine/butter. I used butter for this, and didn't have to drizzle any additional on top. And the seasoned salt was fantastic on top! Great recipe! Thanks!

THIS is the popcorn I grew up on!! My mom made it just like this all the time...sometimes she would just sprinkle on some garlic salt. I do cut down on the amount of fat used, just like another viewer recommended. I can't beleive I have been using microwave all this time.. I'm glad I stumbled across your recipe to get me back in the groove of making REAL popcorn. Now if I could just find some big paper grocery bags.. they're not easy to find around here!!

This is how popcorn was made while I was growing up.  It really is so much better than microwave, and doesn't have all the preservatives.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

The only thing I changed is that I used a 1/4 cup of melted refined virgin coconut oil and 1/4 cup of popcorn (not the microwaveable kind). There was no coconutty taste to the popcorn.

My pot is cheap, old and not a brand name, so while the kernels were popping, I thought for sure I was going to get some burnt ones, especially since I couldn't shake it much without the lid sliding off.  As soon as there was a couple seconds pause with the next pop, I took it off the heat, thinking I'd have a lot of unpopped kernels.   Not only did nothing burn, but there were only a few unpopped kernels. I usually get a lot of unpopped kernals in the microwave-version, plus some burnt ones because I often try to get as much kernels to pop.  Not only is this so much more economical, but really doesn't take much extra time then the microwave-version.  Just, instead of standing by, listening and watching the microwave, just need to shake it a little.  And it's better for the environment too, if you just stir it all up in a large bowl rather than a paper bag.

Excellent every time! A larger pot works as well. Try adding 1/3 cup white sugar to the pot just after the first kernel pops. It will take a minute or so for the kernels to continue popping, but you'll end up with delicious caramel corn! Salt to taste.

I've made this recipe several times and my family loves it. I use canola oil for the vegetable oil and SmartBalance whipped spread in place of margarine. I also add 1/2 tablespoon of salt on top of the kernels in the bubbling oil. It comes out perfectly without burning everytime. 5 stars!

Just made a batch and am enjoying it right now!  I was nervous, since I've never popped corn like this, myself; but I have fond memories of my father and my aunt making popcorn for us.  I'm glad I decided to try! Very easy, very tasty -- thanks for sharing, sir!

I made this lowfat and only used 1 TBLS canola oil and 1 TBLS butter.  It was fantastic.  It even left grease on the paper towels in the bowl.

Interesting recipe how it actually pushes the lid off the pot. I was quite surprised. It turned out very tasty! I'll try will less oil and butter next time.

I just made this popcorn!!  WONDERFUL!!  I have been wanting a stir-crazy popper, but now, I don't need one.  However, I did lessen the oil and butter used.  I only used 2T. canola oil and 1T. butter.  I turned out perfect.  Will make again!!!  DEFINITELY.

I am so glad to have this recipe!  The popcorn tastes great and having the butter flavor already in there is awesome!  Just perfect!  Use the best brand of corn kernels you can find.

Extremely easy to make and delicious.  My daughter loves this one, especially the name, and gets excited whenever I make it because she knows that she gets to eat a tasty snack, but she also gets to "...help Daddy make Daddy's Popcorn."

This was sooooo good so easy. I was given a bag of popcorn kernels from a local food bank and was unsure how to use it without the tools or butters. Never made it on the stovetop. Then I found this recipe!! I made this in a rice pot being that's what I had on hand with a lid and hey, It worked!!! So the recipe says we can season to our liking so I'll say my ONLY changes was adding creole seasoning (instead of seasoning salt) and Garlic salt with parsley to the butter oil mixture as well as sprinkling ontop. The whole family couldn't leave this delicious snack alone. Will make again, and again, and again... right now its 7:55am... is it too early to make another batch lol
Delicious and Super Easy Recipe!!! Thanks

I like to make it Maryland style! Sprinkle with Old Bay after popping and tossing with a little extra melted butter, kosher salt, and fresh ground black pepper.  Very tasty. Nothing beats stove top popcorn.

This was my first EVER try at DIY popcorn. I know now to let the oil heat a bit more, then add the margarine or butter. Mine browned a bit (not necessarily a bad thing) before I added the test kernels and the rest. I used the brown bag trick, tossed it in there with a tiny bit of salt. Less greasy than microwaved bags and MUCH tastier.  I used 2T. Oil and 2T butter.  Just a wonderful recipe and brought back memories of my grandma and grandpa popping corn - in this same pot, as it would happen. Thank you so much, John Gawecki!

BETTER THAN BOY SCOUTS!! ; ) 
"Pamela is very rude! LMAO Indians are not the only ones who have been doing this for a long time."  
I thought the recipe was a great addition to the website, John! I have been popping corn on the stove top for many years. This is a great recipe for beginners who wish to do it the right way from day one. I've switched it up many times, but I always fall back on this tried and true way. ? My family loves it when I pop the corn and even request it on occasion. : )

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it for parties and everybody loves it. I made two servings and there was none left. One question I have to ask is how long it stays good. I want to make it for my class for a party and I want to see if I can make it in the morning and keep it good in my locker for a few hours. But I absolutely love this recipe.

Made it with safflower oil, and butter instead of margarine Ina 3 quart pot. It was awesome! The popping lifted the lid even though it was a bigger pot.

Yum! Made this for outdoor movie night for a group of friends and it was a big hit. Granted, it was a bit more time consuming than your basic microwave popcorn, but this was tastier. I used Amish blue popcorn.  It was nice being able to serve right out of the bags.  Will hang onto this method for sure.

Too much oil.  Take it easy on the salt.

I just made a bowl of this awesome popcorn. Enough for one as I am by myself. Ate the whole thing, no waste since I could adjust the serving size. Much better than microwavable. I added regular salt to the butter and oil and popped the corn. Didn't have to add any additional. I sprinkled some butter flavored seasoning once popped and shook to distribute. Tasted buttery and pretty close to movie theatre popcorn. Now I know the secret to good flavored stovetop popcorn. Excellent recipe and no more microwave popcorn. I even bought the store brand corn and I only had 3 unpopped kernels. Not bad. One poster bought expensive Orville Reddenbocher corn. Not necessary, Great Value from Walmart worked just fine. Like I said, 3 unpopped kernels. Now I will start eating more popcorn. Thank you

It is a simple and easy recipe. You can make anytime for light snack, corn oil can be used as vegetable oil to have a healthier popcorn. Thanks for sharing.

I added 1 tsp. of sugar, and shook it.  Kettle corn type taste, but not so sweet.  For less of a greasy taste, decrease the oil to 3 TBS.

I’ve never made popcorn on the stove top before! This is the easiest recipe for popping corn! I didn’t have any seasoned salt so I just used good ol’ fashioned butter n salt but it turned out fabulous! The paper bag idea is great too!!! ? Thank you for sharing and teaching me how simple stove top popcorn can really be! Oh... and I used some really old kernels that I've had in the cupboard forever!!! ;)

We will NEVER go back to microwave popcorn again. This recipe is so delicious. We've tried reducing the amount of oil for it to be a little healthier but it's nothing compared to the original recipe. This is def a keeper in our family!!! Thank you John for posting!

Those few people complaining about this not being a new recipe annoy me. It may not be new to YOU, but to some people it IS new. As a child, my mom always just popped the popcorn in a pot with oil. No butter or margarine. She topped it with butter after popping. While that popcorn was always tasty, this is absolutely delicious. I use even amounts of oil and margarine, and I add a little salt while the two are melting together just before adding the popcorn. It is quite amazing, and all my daughter's friends LOVE "my" popcorn. Thanks for sharing, although I did get the recipe elsewhere a few years back!!

This was great. I would recommend salting to taste since everyone has such different preferences with saltiness. I thought this was fantastic. We'll definitely use this recipe from now on. If you like olive oil, it's nice to use half olive oil in place of some of the canola and season with rosemary and garlic. Thanks John for sharing this. I've tried a few other stove top recipes and this is the first that I've loved!
