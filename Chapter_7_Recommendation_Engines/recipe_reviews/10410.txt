These tasted more similar to "pecan sandies." For those who complained about them not being sweet enough, just roll them around in powdered sugar after baking. It makes the sweetness just right!

These cookies were really easy and created a delicate and tender cookie. Perfect for serving to guests. I bought these in a bakery and wanted to bake them at home and this recipe was just as good as those in the bakery! Thank you.

These cookies were bland and not nearly sweet enough -- closer to bread than sweetbread. Unworthy of my time and particularly my walnuts!

I made changes to the recipe because as I was making these, I found I didn't have the ingredients I thought I did!  I only had 3/4 cup shortening, so I added 1/4 cup oil.  Without cream of tartar, I found that a sub would amount to 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I used pecans, not walnuts.  If I can still rate this favorably, then I must say, "Delicious!"

Arlene, my husband LOVED these!  Though, I prefer a little bit sweeter cookie, they were light and easy!  I even added a few drops of food coloring and my cookies came out a beautiful PINK!  Thanks!  ...Cristi White, Phoenix, AZ

They taste like baking soda, I even tried cutting down on it when I made them a second time. Big disappointment for me, I loved these cookie from the bakery near my home as a child.

Delicious Light Cookie! If you added some almond extract, could also pass as an almond cookie. Very, very good and oh so easy!

Delicious cookie - and easy!  I tweak by using almond extract instead of vanilla, and adding 1-1/2 tsp. cardamom to the flower.  It's one of the yummiest cookies I've ever made.

My mom makes divinity every year at Christmas time, and it's always a hit! I was so happy to find this recipe because I'm too scared to make divinity on my own. These cookies are amazing!!! I only made a few changes. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 1/4 tsp. of salt. I also omitted the nuts (as I dislike nuts in my cookies) And since I didn't have any eggs, (which is a shock since we always have eggs on hand) I added 4 TBS. of Milk. The cookies turned out great! I plan to serve them to my family after lunch. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

I have made thousands of cookies and this was the worst recipe I have ever made. I directly followed the recipe. It needs to be rewritten to state "combine the first 3 ingredients" not "dry ingredients" as sugar is a dry ingredient. The batter was too dry to roll into balls. There needs to be more liquid, perhaps 2 eggs. There was no flavor. One reviewer mentioned "Pecan Sandies". My Mom used to buy them weekly when I was little and they were always the last cookie to be eaten but they were alot better than this recipe. I only baked one dozen (expecting a bad result) and tossed the whole recipe in the trash. Such a huge waste of my time and money, especially after paying $12.25 for a pound of walnuts!! I feel this recipe doesn't deserve any stars.

Great flavor. Easy cookie. The flavors are better when the cookie cools.

I was expecting a sweeter taste. It should be butter instead of shortening . They were not "delicate" enough for me, actually the texture was kind of sticky; I felt it was missing something. I had to add extra sugar and cinnamon to compensate that at the end and kind of helped. But I would try a different approach to this recipe.

I made these, just substituting walnuts with almonds, and they came out really good! I went on reviews and when they were fresh out of the oven I dipped them in a sugar/cinnamon combo and thy turned out great! :)

The only issue I had was the baking time... 10-12 minutes was only 1/2 the time. I shared a picture of them, they came out pretty! :)

Thank you!
