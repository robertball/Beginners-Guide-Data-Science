This is delicious! The only change I made was using spinach instead of kale. Yum! Apple-wise, since it didn't say what type to use, I used a Braeburn, my favorite.                            

The apple and lemon flavors are most prominent accompanied by the subtle creamy undertones of the avocado. Consistency-wise, this smoothie is slightly thicker than thin. If you like thicker smoothies, add the optional ice. I did not and it is going down smooth.                    

Makes about 4.5 cups of smoothie.

As long as I'm making healthy smoothies, I leave the peel on the apple and don't bother to core it.  I didn't peel the carrot either! This was easy to make!  The citrus really wakes up the taste buds!  Great breakfast!

I like lemon but this was way too lemony for me.  Next time I would put just the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  Also would add more ice and/or make sure the water (I use filtered) was ice cold.  Other than that, great smoothie with a lot of nutrients.

This was actually a really good tasting drink!  I'm not sure what it was about it, but it also had my dog following me around the house crying to have some haha! Perhaps it was the ginger root, I had never used it prior to making this!

Really liked this smoothie! My blender is not high-power or a juicer but it is nicer than your average $20 blender, and this blended very smooth for me without having to pre-blend or prepare the ingredients beforehand. The taste was just right for me and I didn't add any sugar or honey, but I know some people prefer a sweeter smoothie. All in all pretty fantastic and healthy to boot!

I really love this! I added a little cilantro and used 3 kale leaves instead of one, did not add ice or flaxseed. Delicious and a keeper for my kitchen!

We didn't have avacado, so I didn't put any in. I added more ice cubes than it called for. I nuked the carrots for two minutes in water in the microwave (takes out some of the nutrients :( but makes them blend smoother), and I also added some honey and sugar because this was SUPER sour, but I really liked it! 
What I did: 
I put the lemon and water in first and blended, then added the kale, ice cubes, carrots, ginger, and parsley and blended again. Then added the apples and hit it again. MY blender sucks, so this was pretty "pulp-y" but definitely loved the taste. VERY refreshing!

Do not use a whole lemon, that is silly. I use one sizable wedge of lemon only. And I use probably half the water, about a cup, maybe less. You will want to retain the wonderful creaminess of the avocado, not make it too liquified. Otherwise, the blend of flavors in this recipe is pretty outstanding. Apple lemon ginger avo carrot kale (or spinach!) Cleansing and refreshing. Absolutely no sweetener needed if you reduce the lemon. Since getting a Vitamix a month ago, I have been looking for good, well-balanced smoothie recipes. With the appropriate changes, this one is a winner.

I docked this one star only because I felt the tart lemon overpowered the other flavors too much. However, it is great nutrition so I will probably make this smoothie again with half a lemon next time. Also, in spite of distinctly remembering picking out some parsley at the store, I somehow didn't end up with it at home, so I threw in a little fresh mint instead. I am sure the parsley would be good, also, but I did like the mint enough to use it again. Something else I did was put in the avocado pit and leave the lemon peel on. I am sure we all know the great nutritional benefits of avocados and lemons, but did you know the avocado pit and the lemon peel actually are the parts of those fruits with the most nutrition? I know, it sounds crazy to put the pit in and I am not sure if I would have dared to try it in my Ninja Pro (maybe the new Ninja Ultima could do it) but my new Vitamix didn't miss a beat. My drink was smooth and creaamy. By the way, my dog begged for some, too, and to my surprise, liked it--although he did seem a little puzzled by the tartness.
