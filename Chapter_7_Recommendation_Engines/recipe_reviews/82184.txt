Not only is this recipe easy but it is also inexpensive and tasty.  For the pimento sauce I put jarred pimentos in the food processor to create a paste.  It turned out wonderful, thank you for posting this recipe!

This is a great dish, lots of flavor and the white kidney bean is a natural starch carb blocker. I would advise that you follow the measurements and avoid “eyeballing” it.

This was great!  I have made it several times.  I sometimes add some smoked kelbasa sausage cut into medallions.  Very good - my kids ask for this!

I haven't made this but plan on making it for our supper club dinner this Saturday.  I need to know before so I can get all the ingredients - what is pimento sauce?

Loved it!
The only change I made was that I used a vegetarian boullion cube and 1/2 can of tomatos.

made this in my creuset saute pan.  sauteed the onion and garlic with the spices to start, then added the tomato paste, and then the rest.  i didn't have pimento sauce, so i whirred up some jarred roasted red peppers to substitute.  we also like things a bit spicy so i doubled the cumin and added some cayenne.  served with brown rice pasta and a side of steamed broccoli - DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!  this is going in the rotation for sure!  thanks for a great recipe!

I have to say that this sauce is a great base.  I was prepared to make spaghetti for my husband's dinner when unexpectedly he had to pick up a friend at the airport coming in from Jordan.  A quick search on here brought me to this recipe that I thought I could use as a base for a spaghetti sauce with a middle eastern flair.  The sauce is great; am sure it is great with beans.  I made the meatballs from the 'Kafta(bbq)' recipe on here and it was great!!!  Only changes besides the beans was adding more cumin and 2 bay leafs. I also didn't have a can of beef broth so had some turkey broth in the fridge and subbed that instead.  Also a couple of chopped roma tomatoes. I will try it with the beans next time.  The sauce alone is great.

I didn't think there was anything special with this recipe.  The sauce was bland and not worth the effort.  Sorry, it wasn't for me.

Okay but not completely satisfied with the texture of the beans... Flavor was a little funky too and I suspect that was the result of the crockpot. Will try it again cooking it on the stovetop.

Really simple dish that is flavourful and delicious.  Serve with some parboiled rice and this is an easy and healthy meal.  Even the kids eat it up!
Pimento paste can be found in the 'European ethnic' food isle at my grocery store.  It is very salty, and can be stored in the freezer if you don't use it very often (it will remain as a paste due to high salt content).

very tasty, we added spinach, spanish paprika, and kielbasa to fill it out. Sun dried tomatos may be nice too.

This was a simple and tasty bean dish. I didn't have pimentos, but I will try to use them next time I make this. I think I'm going to add this to my dinner rotation. It reminded me of the fassoulia plaki that I've had at an Armenian restaurant. Very nice!
