Any time my wife has seconds on anything, I know it was a big success. And that's what she did with this. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only changes: substituted red onion (didn't have green) and added garlic (because we always include garlic).
I had a question about hi or low temp for the broiler. Opted for hi and it turned out just right.
Also, next time I make it I will create a little wall with the aluminum foil around the fish to prevent the creamy sauce from spilling.

I loved this!  This is now my favorite way to eat cod. I scaled the recipe to 2 servings for hubs and I,  skipped the hot sauce, added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used the thicker cut loins. My fish was broiled on high about 8" from the broiler since it was thick and I knew it would take longer. I broiled about 10 minutes before adding the sauce and broiled for another 2 minutes as stated. I would consider a light oil coating before the first broil next time on the loins to ensure the outer doesn't dry out. This probably wouldn't be needed on fillets since they cook faster. The butter allowed some of the topping to melt off and into the pan. Save that yummy goodness and spread over the fish when done. Or just eat it with a spoon, which ever you prefer. This recipe is a keeper. Yum!

I've made this 3 times now; we love it! I've made it based on the recipe exactly but I have to say I preferred when I messed it up. The first time I made it I doubled the recipe but forgot to double the parm. Everyone went nuts over it! The next time I made it correctly and we all thought it was a little too bold and dry. I also always add garlic and never remember to buy green onions. It's a versatile dressing though and was quickly drizzled onto the rice, veggies, bread... I think my brother would have drank it straight.

We love this sauce! I am making it for the third time today. When I don't have lemon I use crystallized lemon and it turns out perfect! It's kind of addicting, the type of taste that you miss when it's all gone. I crave it sometimes. Yummy with jasmine rice! I haven't needed to change much in this recipe, but I love reviewers who share their modifications; that's one of the reasons why I read reviews.

This sauce is incredible! My husband and I like it best on cod. The only thing I changed is the amount of mayo; I use about half of what the recipe calls for because otherwise it's a little overwhelming. Definitely a new go-to recipe!

This sauce is PHENOMENAL! So, so, so delicious and easy to make! I made this on the spur of the moment one night when I was searching for something quick and easy to prepare with ingredients I had on hand. I do not like Tabasco, so I added some garlic powder and a splash of white wine. I will definitely make this again!

I doubled the sauce but did not double the parmesan cheese, I left out the dill (for my 11 year old), and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of onion powder (did not have green onion. I left out the salt, didn't need it. (kraft parmesan cheese had enough salt in it) We Loved it! And my very very very picky eater son liked it too!!!  The extra sauce was nice to put on the rice and broccoli I made with it. It made the family recipe book :) oh and no hot sauce!

We cut the butter to 3T, left out the salt, and substituted Romano cheese. Delicious!

Easy, fast and delicious. I used talapia and served it with rice. My husband, the fish skeptic asked for seconds!  Definitely adding this to the recipe box.  The Parmesan/mayo mix is delicious addition to plain rice too!

This was YUMMY! I used it on cod and I even used fat free mayo and it was still excellent. Be careful with the hot sauce though.

I have made this recipe several times and really wanted to rate it. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. And tonight I changed it with suggestions from others: a bit less butter in the sauce and added garlic. (I am a garlic nut). It is still a really excellent recipe that is my go to with fish. I have also used this sauce (heated on the stove) over chicken and pasta.

Used it on Swordfish.  Even my husband like it and said it really made the fish.  He is not the biggest fish fan.  Thinking of swapping out mayonnaise for Greek yogurt for a healthier option next time.  I used light butter.   I grilled the fish instead of baking.  We live in AZ so can grill out year round, helps keep from heating up the house!

I have made this recipe twice.  I found it  to be too salty after the first time, so tonight I eliminated the salt completely and it was so much better.  I think the inherent salt in the Parmesan cheese is plenty.   I've used this sauce as a topping on a burger and thought it was great!

This recipe was so good it caused me to write my first review on Allrecipes!  I'm not a big fish lover, but I might become one now!  Don't worry if you have more sauce than you need; it is great on your rice, pasta, or whatever you serve with the fish.  I didn't use the foil, so it was easy to scoop up the leftover sauce.

This recipe rocks!  The best method we've tried. So flaky and delicious. Our broiler recommended low for fish that's thinner and high for thicker cuts. However, garlic is a must for our family.

No changes except in technique. We dredged catfish with whole wheat flour and sautéed in a skillet, then coated with sauce and broiled until bubbly. We also used the sauce for steamed potatoes on the side. Deeply browned zucchini slices & salad rounded out the meal. Yum!

Very tasty, sort of like a scampi sauce.  Would be good on any fish or seafood.  I will make it again, even though it has a high calorie/fat content.

I was skeptical at trying this at first but now I’m hooked! I always chop fresh garlic and add it to this when I make it. Such an easy way to cook fish. I love using this on salmon.

Quick and easy and  yummy.  I had all the ingredients already in my fridge and freezer.  I used tilapia instead of cod and I added so shrimp. My husband loved it

I followed the recipe to a tea, all except the fresh Parmesan. I used a jarred type, and it came out fantastic, I will definitely  make this again, and again.

Delicious! My picky 11 year old declared she hated cod, about 3 minutes before she said "this sauce is delicious!" and ate all her cod. SUCCESS! My husband and I also loved it. I'm going to start slathering this on everything I cook! ;-)

Excellent, fast & good. I doubled the recipe & skipped the hot sauce. I also lightly seasoned my fish first with garlic sea salt & pepper.  I used half the sauce on 6 Tilapia fillets a few days ago  over brown rice & now I just broiled 5 more fillets and used the other half of the sauce I had stored in the refrigerator. Dinner was done In 48 minutes, but only because I had to unthaw the fish. After that, it  only took me  15 minutes to prepare the fish....5 min prep & 10 min to cook.  This  recipe is one I have been  looking for, quick, easy, and delish!

Super simple, super good. My kids loved this as well! I seasoned the fillets with one of  my favorite Cajun seasonings and left out the salt and pepper. It was excellent! Next time, I'm going to add shrimp and scallops to the broiling.

This was so delicious! I used salmon instead of cod. Mine had to cook a bit longer than the recipe called for. I did grate the Parmesan fresh and I think that made a huge difference. I’m really not sure what the hot sauce does since there is so little in there. I might try it without next time and see if there’s a difference. I didn’t use the dill.

Husband and I both really loved it.  Will encourage us to eat more fish.  We used Cod fillets.  I substituted onion flakes as didn't have green onions.  I also used garlic powder as others suggested.  It was so simple to make too!   Use a heavy pan to cook in, preferably one with higher sides to contain any liquids.  I used the broiler on high.

Update: I have made this and it is yummy! Used  tilipia not cod. Doubled the dill. The sauce was good on the fish. so saving it that way works, huzzah! I haven't in actuality made this YET but the site won't let me save so I am doing a "Hail Mary"using this as my cue- I am hoping I can remember this until Friday when I plan on fish for dinner (along with rice) -Looks yummy!!

I have made this dish twice now, the second time with rather less butter which was better.  It is an excellent way of serving which fish with interest.  My guests loved it on both occasions.

Kept recipes almost exact - except used grape seed oil instead of butter when broiling the fish, and added a splash of white wine (Pinot Grigio) to the fish prior to boiling, as well.  As far as the cream sauce - I just added a little extra mayo.  Oh - I did not have green onions, and after working all day, I did not feel like running out to the store (lol) - so, I used onion powder & garlic powder.  Normally, I try to use as much fresh as possible, but these days - I don’t care, as long as it tastes good - and it is Deeee-licious!  My husband is standing here, scraping up the rest of the sauce. Lol!  Excellent recipe.  Especially for a quick, weekday meal!  Sided with jasmine rice, and a side salad.  Perfection! ; )

This was super easy, really quick, and tasted great. It didn't convert the 7 year old who generally dislikes fish, but the 8 and 2 year old enjoyed it as did all 3 grown ups. We ate it all; I'll make more next time.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce, added garlic and was out of dill so I used Italian seasoning. I didn't actually measure anything - just eyeballed it. That's my favorite kind of dish!

This is perfect for a low-carb high-fat diet. I'll be making it often.

Never thought cheese and fish went together well BUT this was very tasty, quick & easy too. I used cod. Turned out great.

This is definitely a keeper. Quick and easy to make. I used it on grouper and tuna. Both were hits!

Made it according to the direction, I only reduced the amount of butter a bit, and it turned out great! My boyfriend and I loved it and he asked me to cook this "tasty dish" again soon.

we loved it!  I used butter, parmesan cheese, light Mayo, and green chile. Easy and delicious. My husband said it is the best fish he has ever had!

DELISH,  although I did modify to fit what I had and what I knew my kids will eat.  Left out the onion and the hot sauce and it was still a huge hit with 3 kids under 10 and my hubby!  Super easy to prepare as well!  Thanks for the quick easy school night meal!

Awesome and easy.  Works well with fresh walleye too.  If you're not on a diet put the sauce on thick. It's so tasty. We used the runoff sauce on fresh pressure cooked carrots and broccoli  for our sides.  WOW.  ;) Enjoy.

So yummy! J didn't like but the rest of us loved it! Was spooning it on the other foods too. If anything, could use a little less parm cheese and would still be good.

Absolutely, our new favorite fish recipe. I let the butter soften and then used fresh dill and let the sauce sit in fridge for an hour. But we reduced the fish to 1 lb and there was extra sauce.

This sauce is super flavorful and very easy to prepare. I kept stealing tastes out of the bowl while waiting on the fish to thaw. The dill flavor is very strong and almost overpowered my very high quality imported Parmesan, don't get me wrong- I love dill, but I might have preferred fresh for a milder taste (too bad I had thrown out  my fresh dill this morning). Unfortunately my fish was not that good. It was too thin and I couldn't cook it long enough to get the sauce to bubble and brown. I will probably try this recipe again with better piece of fish. I think it is a nice recipe to serve family, but I would prefer a fancier sauce for guests. Finally, I wish the recipe would have specified whether the broiler should be set to lo or high.

I only had about 1/2 pound of cod, so I cut way back on the amounts of the ingredients but did use everything called for, except the hot sauce and salt. It's a delightful combination of flavors and I will use this again. Oh, and I baked this at 350 for 15 minutes, rather than broiling it.  Thank you for posting!

Made this tonight (with a mix of parmesan and romano cheese) and the whole family loved it !  I used a couple of splashes of Tapatio, rather than tabasco, and it was excellent.  Will definitely be adding this to the rotation for nights that we have fish for dinner.

I tried this sauce tonight and used it on Tilapia and Salmon fillets.  It was very good and easy to fix. I will use this again.

Just tried this sauce for the second time tonight. Made it the first time with Cod and tonight..Tilapia. It's probably just me,however,I prefer the latter. This sauce will definitely be my "go to" from this day forward!!(next up..shrimp,yum)
