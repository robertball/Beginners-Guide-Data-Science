Good proportions. Even better the next day. When you simmer the pasta, don't boil it and watch it closely because there is just enough liquid. Since I made this out of what i had in the cupboard, I used a big can of tomatoes and a small can of broth to equal the same amount of liquid.  More seasoning, maybe two TABLESPOONS of Italian seasoning, salt and black pepper of course. Don't forget the cheese, it really makes a flavor difference.

I changed the recipe a little and drained the broth and added about 1 cup of tomatoes and simmered the tomatoes with the chicken and poured the chicken on the noodles, it was very tasty!!

This recipe was okay. I added shredded mozzarella cheese to top it off to add a little more taste. Next time I probably won't use any tomatoes. This time I used mixed vegetables of carrots, peas, corn, and lima beans. I might do without the lima beans next time.

DELICIOUS! so I didn't have corkscrew pasta so I used bow tie instead(which looked a bit more elegant) and followed other reviews and did 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning and I found it to be just perfect!

This recipe gave me a great jumping off point for my dinner last night. Our cupboards were bare but I pulled off a pretty great dinner (according to my family) in about 30 minutes. I cooked a box of penne pasta in a large covered pot in about 3 cups broth and 3 cans of diced tomatoes (one of which was olive oil and garlic seasoned). I added Italian seasoning, minced garlic, black pepper and salt to taste. When almost done, I threw in a can of corn, a can of green beans and 6 cans (about 3 cups) of diced chicken breast (all drained). When warmed through, I added about a cup of shredded Italian cheese and about a half cup of Parmesan cheese. Served this with garlic bread. I didn't have salad but that would have rounded the meal out. It served 6 hungry adults. Delicious!
