This was wonderful! The only thing I left out was the liquid smoke flavoring. I slow cooked it for about 10 hrs. and it was very flavorful and moist. I used whole wheat buns and veggies to complete the meal. I will be making this again...

I decided to make this for our Super Bowl party.  I like to cook something easy and it has to have great spices/seasonings to have a wonderful flavor.  This was AWESOME!  Friends & family walked in the house and loved the smell of the brisket.  To sum it up. . . they licked the crockpot clean and wanted more.

my family also licked the bowl! great recipe:) I even doubled it because I have a hard time finding a 3-4 pound brisket, the ones in my store are usually closer to 7 or more AND I'm glad I did because EVERYONE loved it soo much!

This is AWESOME! 
Makes the house smell great all day long
Just remember (As the recipe says) to put a towel over the top of the blender and hold on tight. I didn't and got a bit of scalding juice on my hand...Ouch!!!!

My husband and I loved this.  I didn't quite follow the recipe to the letter.  I used Quorn steak strips (a meat substitute) and put all the ingredients into a medium saucepan, brought it to a boil and then let it simmer for about 40 minutes.  I served it in a tortilla wrap with fresh baby spinach.  I'm sure it would be even better with real beef.

Unfortunately I had to omit the sugar, beer, cornstrarch and buns (Atkins) and used zero carb ketchup and this was still amazing straight out of the crockpot. Can't wait to try the original recipe!

Ooooo this was yummy!! I prepared the beef the night before and "marinated" it in the dry rub overnight in my crockpot insert in the fridge. I also made up the bbq sauce the night before cooking. Next morning....placed insert into the slow cooker and poured the sauce over the marinated dry rubbed beef....lid on....set on low and off to work......that made life a lil easier that morning....served on potato rolls and with homemade slaw. Family loved these sandwiches. I also used boneless chuck roast as it was way cheaper than a 4 lb brisket.....this meat was very tender.....thanks!

Although I used just over 3 lbs. of beef cubes, I did not reduce the other ingredients.  I did leave out the liquid smoke flavoring as I had none on hand.  It was very, very tasty--one guest really loved it!  However, it was very thin and required extra thickening.  As a leftover, it was more tangy--good but not as good as freshly made.

This is a GREAT recipe although I would suggest cooking it over night becuase the smells that this dish creates will drive you nuts during the day because you will want to eat it before its done cooking! 

I changed the serving size so it did alter the measurements automatically so I think doing that caused it to be bland at first but I did take a few tastes throughout the day and added more of the spices to make it better. I also added some BBQ sauce to kick start the flavors a bit. 

In the end all you need are some potato rolls, sour cream & shredded cheese....my husband ate three! I will be making this again ;)

A solid 4.5 stars.  I cut the recipe in half anit it comfortably served four with leftovers to boot.  I subbed white cooking wine for the beer.  My brisket only made 2 cups of sauce, so I thickened all of it and did not find it necessary to blend or puree.  This was very well received by all who tried it.  It is a mild tasting sweet BBQ.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe! Instead of brisket, we used aboout 2 1/2 pounds of left-over barbequed tri-tip we had in the freezer from our wedding about a month ago. Used pretty much the same ingredients as listed, plus our own rub we make. Put it in the crock pot on high for about 2 hours, then on low for another 90 minutes or so. After removing the meat(which was fall apart tender) we doubled the slurry amount (as we tend to prefer a thicker sauce) and used our immersion blender. Absolutely great way to use up left overs. Thank you!

I am extremely picky when it comes to meat. But this is absolutely the best recipe I have found on this site so far. I used a full bottle of Blue Moon Belgium White Ale. My husband and I took the meat to work for lunch and everybody wanted to taste it, it smelled so good. We used it like a fajita filling and had fresh vegetables with it. It was very filling and was a perfect meal for those long 12-hour shifts that we are working. Will definitly cook this again.

I made this as written, but when it was time to shred the roast, I just took my forks and did this, did not put in a blender.  I did make some additions to the sauce as I heated it on the stove by adding some sugar and salt, but it still tasted like it needed something.

This recipe was really tasty and I started it before I went to bed.  The house smelled amazing when we woke up.  I did follow the recipe exactly with one exception -  I used the whole can of beer since I do not drink beer but have no problem cooking with it...

Followed the recipe to the letter and it was a big hit. I served it with coleslaw, baked beans, chips, and lemonade. I will make this again, and won’t change a thing, although it would probably work well with chicken or pork. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent BBQ.  I used rump roast instead and it turned out fine.  Less fat as well.  10-12 hours is a lot.  I cooked it less and it worked out well.

The only change I made was to add about 3/4 bottle of bbq sauce. It thickened the sauce a bit, and my husband LOVES bbq sauce! I threw it in the crock pot the night before, and cooked for about 15 hours. Deelish!
Our friend said this is what you expect to get when you go to a bbq joint, but way better!
