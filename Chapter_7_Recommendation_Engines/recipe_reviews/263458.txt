My first attempt making tomato soup.  Loved that I didn't need to peel the tomatoes.  I only used cherry tomatoes from my garden, roasted them, and added a cup of soaked raw cashews and nutritional yeast in the blending.  What resulted was a lovely, not too tomatoey, creamy like soup that was good hot or cold.

Maybe the tomatoes I used weren't perfect for this recipe? It's so sour. This was the first soup I've made that my husband wasnt crazy for.

Great tomato soup.  I added 1/2 cup coconut milk and left out the cherry tomatoes.
