Very good recipe. I rolled mine to about a 1/4 inch. This made the cookies just right...they weren't too soft or to crunch which is just the way I like them! It also is a very easy dough to handle when you're rolling it out. thats a bonus! I also left out the almond extract and added extra vanilla and they taste wonderful!

Not a good recipe for cutting out shapes. Dough was very gooey and I had a hard time transfering from rolling surface to cookie sheet. When cooking they spread out flat distorting shape.

This made a great sugar cookie!  The dough was easy to handle and not sticky at all, even after just a few minutes in the freezer.  The cookies tasted just as I had hoped.  I did add 1/4 tsp salt, which I would do again.

My sister-in-law makes these cookies every year.  She rolls the dough 1/4" thick or a little bit thicker and uses a large circle cookie-cutter and then bakes them on parchment paper until the bottoms just begin to change color.  She spreads some with a glaze while they are still warm, or serves them plain which are good, too.  I cannot make them like she can, but she swears this is the recipe, so I just look forward to holiday time.

I bake constantly for the holidays and I have to say this is one of the best tasting sugar cookie recipes I have ever made. The dough is a little sticky but not enough to really be a nuisance. My family loves them and they were easy for the kids to decorate.

For this I decided to skip chilling the dough and it worked prefectly fine. I also baked for 7 mins. They where perfectly golden brown on the bottom. I found the dough easy to work with. I rolled it on waxed paper and i didn't stick. I used buttercream icing on top. perfect for holidays or as I made them for any time!

I did some changes to this and it worked out perfectly.  Nice and chewy!  I used regular sugar since I did not have any powdered sugar on hand - same amount 1 1/2 cups.  I also used 2 tsp of baking powder since it is practically the same as baking soda and cream of tartar.  They were a hit.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever had!  I made them for Easter and they stayed soft until they were all gone!  The dough is hard to work with, so I put it in the freezer for a couple of hours and rolles it between waxed paper while frozen.  The effort was well worth it, however, because they had an excellent flavor and texture.  I will definitely make these again.

This is a really good sugar cookie recipe. The dough should probably chill for longer than one hour, though. One hour was not enough. The dough was very soft and difficult to work with. Also, I rolled them to about 1/4 inch thick instead of 1/8. I'll make these again and again!

I have a quick tidbit of advice for all who have had issues with keeping the shape of cutouts while baking in anyrolled dough cookie...the trick which i learned in school is once u have your cookies cut out place them on your baking sheet and cool them again before baking this will help hold the shape and prevent them from spreading out too much :) hope this is healpful!

These cookies are the absolute best sugar cookies I have ever made. My daughter loved helping me and we decorated with sprinkles. She always asks for them. I'm sure we will cherish the recipe, and the joy of making them together time and time again. (We are making Halloween themed ones this weekend.)

I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  After I got the dough out of the fridge, I had to work and work the dough just to roll it out.  It kept cracking and falling apart on me.  I finally got half of it rolled out and managed to cut out some cookies.  But it was quite a chore!  Although difficult to roll out, these are the best tasting sugar cookies ever.  I tried decorating a few with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe I found here, but after struggling with a few, decided these cookies were better off without icing.

Very easy and tasty!  The dough was a little soft so I ended up with some messy shapes.  I also probably didn't let it set in the refrigerator long enough.  I used the confectioners sugar instead of flour, which I hadn't done before, worked much better than i thought. I replaced half the margarine with no sugar added applesauce and used 1 tsp lemon juice instead of almond (because i didn't have any) and they were, like it said very tasty!

these cookies are good. i made them a day ahead and rolled them out the next day. even with all the confectioners sugar it still stuck to everything. I had more on my hands then i did cookies. even though they were very messy i will make them again. the almond really makes the difference.

Very close to the recipe from the Making Sugar Cookies Video from the side bar. Roll half batch in between parchment paper and then chill it flat in the freezer before cutting shapes; much easier to handle and removing the cut outs. I highly suggest baking them on parchment as well.

This recipe did not turn out for me at all!  I don't know if I did them too thin, but they fell apart while I took them off the cookie sheet.  They did not brown up either.  I don't know what I did wrong!

This was the first time I have made cut out cookies and they have all gone. I ended up leaving the dough in the fridge for about 6 hours. Really nice to roll out and cut, I might roll them a bit thinner next time for my personal taste although everyone else loves the thicker ones. Thanks so much Dawn.

A family favorite. This dough can be made a head of time and refrigerated. We often make the dough and leave it in the fridge until the next night.

Great cookie!  Not too egg-y like some I've tasted.  I didn't chill the dough and instead dropped it by rounded teaspoons onto a lightly greased cookie sheet.  They came out perfectly!

Well, I am not sure what i did wrong with this recipe, the cookies didn't turn out well as i hoped. In fact, they didn't look done when we took them out of the oven after 8 mins of baking in 350 degrees. So i increased it to 11 mins and they still didn't look baked all the way. After they were done cooling, to my kids' disappointment, they didn't look good enough to put frosting on. 
I don't mean to blame on the recipe because it's got many good reviews. I did follow exactly what the recipe said but mine did not turn out okay like the other ones I did in the past. :-(

My kids were so excited to make cookies so I made this dough the night before, rolled it into a ball, wrapped it up tight, and then the next day after school it crumbled into a million different pieces.  Totally diappointing

When the first batch came out of the oven, we tried them and I didn't think much of them.  Then, the next day, my husband took some to work and he called me to tell me to keep this recipe and we have to make more!  Once they got cold, they were awesome!  When I got home, I tried one myself and had to agree.  These cookies have been added to the "Christmas Cookie Must Haves" for my family!!

These are the best tasting sugar cookies ever!  The dough was easy to work with and baked up perfectly.

This was absolutely the best tasting sugar cookie I've ever had.  Delicious! But the cookies were hard to roll out.  I just made them into balls and flattened them with the back of a glass.  Out of the oven, I dusted them with powdered sugar.  The next week I made them for my daughter's Confirmation class and they gave them rave reviews too.  The only problem is that they are nearly immpossible roll out for shaping. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  Based on taste only I'd give these cookies 5+.

this is the third sugar cookie recipe i have tried from this site. this with out a doubt was the best in texture. the other ones where too britle. but this definetly isn't a cut out cookie recipe. I just rolled little balls and flattened them out once i saw the cut out batch didn't keep there shape.

I couldn't find my favorite sugar cookie recipe so I decided to try a new one.  Let's just say this is now my favorite!  I used normal sugar and added a little more flour than it called for in order to skip chilling.  Cookies turned out perfect and tasted great!

Although they tasted good, these cookies were way too crumbly after being baked.  They essentially fell apart when handled, which is less than ideal.  I won't make these again.

I made these cookies to give to friends and family for Christmas, and ended up having to make a second batch because I ate the first one! They are delicious, crispy, held nicely when I cut them out in shapes. Just absolutely wonderful.

Good flavor, cookies were crispy when rolled thin. Didn't hold edge shapes well enough for detailed cookie cutters (a snowflake turned into a daisy after baking). The lightly browned baked cookies held up to royal icing quite nicely. Stayed fresh for several days.

These are truly THE BEST sugar cookies I have ever had.  They actually taste GOOD! (Previously, I had considered sugar cookies merely vehicles for icing and sprinkles.)  The almond extract makes all the difference.  Yum!  I had no probs with rolling/cutting.  I didn't like rolling in confectioner's sugar - it led to caramelized sugar on the bottom of the cookies...  otherwise, highly recommended!

I also used only vanilla extract and had lovely results with this recipe.  It definitely has a softer flavor than some sugar cookies I've had, but that's not necessarily a terrible thing.

The cookies spread too much and they are really bland even by sugar cookie standards. The only thing that I can say about this recipe is that after it's chilled, it's easy to work with. Otherwise, it's not worth your time to make it.

This recipe is a very good recipe. My siblings and nephews love cookies and tonight the browns are playing so I shaped them into footballs. To add some flavor I added a dash of pumpkin spice . I will make these again during Christmas like in the picture. If you don't have any almond extract just double the amount of vanilla extract.

This recipe sure is great. I added half a teaspoon more vanilla. The cookies turned out chewy and crunchy while maintaining its moist. You don't even need icing for them since they are already sweet and delicious enough. However, I'm a sugar addict and icing and sprinkles make them look fancy and good.  Made the whole house smell like I'm in heaven  while they were in the oven and when I opened the container where they are stored the next day, the smell of vanilla is so strong anyone would love it. :-)

These cookies have a great flavor and texture. My only complaint was that my hands got cramps from working with the dough after it came out of the fridge!! It was rock hard and was very crumbley. I thought I had ruined it, but decided that the warmth from my hands might form it back together. I was right, but it took quite an effort. Other than that, the dough rolled out really well!

Fabulous! I made these for my sons class and they were a big hit. I also made them for a local restaurant for the Valentine Dinner yesterday. I cut out 2 inch hearts and I covered them in the Sugar Cookie Glaze from this site and also drizzled them with the Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site.They were a huge hit!

Please don't waste your time using these for cut outs.  I don't care how thin/thick you roll them.  They fluff up and are way to dry.  They crumbled almost instantly.

Taste is good.

I wasted two batches.

I was not happy with this recipe but I could have rolled it out a little thicker and that would have helped a lot. But otherwise they turned out too brittle and I like my sugar cookies to have a slightly moist bite.

It was very strange using confectioners sugar on these cookies, however, they turned out very tasty. I didn't roll in confectioners sugar for cutouts, I used flour cause we decorated them. The texture was good. The taste very tasty. I also liked the ones that were thicker and cooked for 8 minutes better than the thinner ones, for that made them not so hard and melt in your mouth nummy.

Exceptional recipe.  I made 2 batches for a school Christmas party for the kids to decorate and the cookies turned out great.  The dough was easy to roll out and the cookies retained the Christmas tree shape I wanted beautifully.  I took some to work and received numerous compliments on the taste of these cookies!

Really great flavor, simple to make, i found tohe dough to be a bit sticky, so i added about 3/4 cup granulated sugar, i turned the dough out on to a piece of waxwed paper and wrapped it in a ball. i stuck it in the freezer for about 15 minutes and it was perfect to work with then. i cut off a piece the size i needed then stuck the rest in the frig. they didn't hold their shape very well, so i had to make fondant to decorate them so they could be detected as what they were.  big hit!

I am so happy to have found my go to sugar cookie recipe.  It is delicious and perfect for cut out cookies.  The only thing I did differently was roll it to 1/4 in. thickness rather than 1/8th.  They came out soft yet sturdy and the dough was incredibly easy to work with even without chilling first.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!!

Gret recipe I made these cookies a while ago. the texture was some what grainy and the crumbled almost instantly but thats what napkins are for. The flavor of the cookie was Awasome it was worth the crumbs. I didn't have any almond extract so I used the vanilla and coconut extract. it was so good next time I will use the almond. Thanks for the Great recipe.

I followed the recipe to a T, twice and both times the cookies were impossible to roll, and got stuck to the surface which I rolled them on (Which was liberally flowered). For the second batch, I gave them EXTRA time in the chill chest to no avail.
The dough tasted delicious and I was so excited, unfortunately these cookies turned out to be a flop.

It is very important to make sure the temperature is correct when baking these cookies.  Our oven got shut off while a batch of these cookies were in the oven by accedent.  We turned it back on and baked them off and every cookie stuck to the pan and crumbled when we tried to get them off.  However, the other cookies we made came out ok.  I am thinking it may not be a bad idea to lightly grease the pan...just to be safe.  But the cookie itself was very tasty.

WOW!!!! Let me just set up this story by saying that i came down with pnemonia and a kidney infection but had promised my children's school that I would provide sugar cookie cutouts for their Christmas parties. I mixed up five batches of dough and put them in the fridge last night and then was unable to finish them, I awoke this morning and my husband who is a great cook but absolutely never bakes actually rolled cut and baked these cookies for me. They came out amazing, he said they were incredibly easy and they are quite delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!

The dough was way too soft to do cut-outs. Even after chilling for a couple of hours. It needed about another 1-2 cups more of flour, then it worked great. I added about 1/4 tsp. salt to the recipe, as well. The almond extract makes them smell wonderful!

This is a great recipe!  I followed exactly, regrigerated the dough, didn't have any problems at all.  It cut the shapes great, and the cookies retained their shape.  Am making again to pass out for Christmas.

These cookies were absolutely amazing.  A little difficult to roll and cut but we didn't refrigerate like it said to.  Also didn't have almond extract, so replaced with lemon and it gave it a lighter taste.  Baked for 6 1/2 minutes instead of seven.  The cookies looked so pretty when they were all together, even though we thought we decorated them like five year olds!!

Dough was horribly sticky even after two hours of chilling wrapped in plastic wrap and flat for maximum cold.  Did not come off of non-stick cookie sheets and didn't seem to matter if they were allowed to cool on them or not.  Puffed up so much the shapes were distorted.  Very "tender" and so fell apart just moving them around on the cooling racks.  Sorry but will not use again.  They did taste good though - in all the little pieces.

These cookies are not very good.  They taste like baking soda and egg.  They don't hold their shape while baking either.  My boyfriend wouldn't even eat them (and he'll eat anything.)

I tried this recipe as is, no changes whatsoever, and it is THE BEST sugar cookie recipe I have ever made. This will definitely be my new sugar cooking recipe. One note of caution, the recipe works best w/simple cookie cut-outs such as candy canes and bells. Large, detailed cut-outs do not hold their form and the dough bleeds while baking.

This is a great recipe. I have used it several times around the holidays. At work we have cookie exchanges every year and this is the cookie I bring. Everyone loves it.

I really don't like sugar cookies.  That being said, this recipe was actually not too bad as far as sugar cookies go!  My kids like to make them so they can do all the cookie cutter shapes, and this dough was a little soft, but still worked well.  I think leaving it in the fridge a little longer would be helpful.  I rolled them to about 1/4 inch thick and they turned out nice and crispy on the outside with a little softness inside.  If you want a really soft sugar cookie, this is not the recipe for you.  Overall, I thought this recipe was great and met our needs well.

My husband liked this best of all the sugar cookies I've made.
