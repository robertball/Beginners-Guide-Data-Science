These cookies are super easy and a lot tastier than they look. I mixed a little cinnamon with the powdered sugar before I rolled them (which may account for some of the ugliness of mine). They are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Really yummy. My son made sure to remind me to put some in his lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe! I was trying to find a way to use the brownie mix I had and this was perfect! I'll totally be using this again.

These are really easy to make !! I used two 18 ounce family size brownie mixes, then the rest of ingredients I doubled.  (Except for confectioner's sugar)  It worked out just fine.  I found just like regular pan brownies--don't over bake!! More on the 12 minute side for bake time.  I'd make them again anytime!!

Make these in teaspoon size balls as they do expand and make sure to leave plenty of space between them. I had a few that were too close together and as a result didnâ€™t crisp up well around the edges. That aside these are very easy to make and the kids loved them.  I made 2 individual batches.  The first was according to the receipe. On the second batch I changed it up a bit and used peppermint extract in place of the vanilla. Very good cookies and super easy to make

These are yummy.  I used an 18.3 oz brownie mix and kept the other ingredients the same.  Chewy and addicting, I can't stop eating them!  Thanks!

Turned out way too thin and hardly any powdered sugar on them. They got too hard when cool but they tasted great when still warm and gooey

Super easy, super quick, super yummy!  I didn't roll mine in the sugar, and added some nuts to the mix.  There's really no disguising that they're brownies!

Really yummy!!  I ran out of vanilla extract so I used peppermint extract.
