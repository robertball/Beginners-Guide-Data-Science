I really enjoyed this dish. Unfortunately, there is snow covering my garden herbs this time of year so I resorted to using dried thyme leaves and rosemary (I ground the rosemary more fine in my coffee grinder). I didn't measure the seasonings, just sprinkled to taste. Very good! As others noted, it did take more than 20 minutes to roast - about 40-45 minutes to get a tender bite. The sweetness of the potato combined with the savory herbs was perfect! I love the coconut oil also. Yum!  I will make this again.

My friend made these for our Thanksgiving dinner, this year. We really enjoyed these - a great change from the overly sweet sweet potato tradition [which I don't touch!]! Her husband had picked up virgin coconut oil - I would probably use refined - or a mix of the two - the coconut flavor was just a little strong for me - though my friend really liked it . . .

Delicious! However, took much longer than 20 minutes to cook right.

I've never cared for sweet potatoes. Came across this recipe and decided to try one more time.  I LOVE this recipe.  They were delicious!  I cooked them exactly as the recipe instructed and they were perfect. I've made them several times now.  A keeper!

Delicious! I left it in the oven for 45 minutes after reading the other reviews.  Didn't measure anything, but I'm sure I used more rosemary and lots more coconut oil - about a tablespoon.

It did take a lot longer for my oven to cook.  I would estimate about 45 minutes or so.  I didn't have rosemary so I used basil and I added in some small white potatoes to the mix.  I loved it but would have loved it just as it was written!!

I feel like I’m the only way to say this but I found the seasoning ratio to be wayyyyy too much (something I never thought I’d say!) - Otherwise, it was great! Very delicious!

Really yummy...Maybe it’s just me but the prep time took a lot longer than 10 minutes , probably because  I did 3lbs of sweet potatoes! The dish turned out really well and 3lbs made a half sheet,  worth making again!

This very good. The stores in our area do not sell fresh thyme and rosemary so I used dried. Still was very good. And my daughter suggested onions in it and it came out delicious

So good! I used 2 sweet potatoes with the suggested amount of coconut oil and it was perfect! I’ll use less rosemary next time but I didn’t measure it out. I’m not a sweet potato person but I love these!! I will definitely make these again!

Awesome way to have fresh sweet potatoes! I had small fingerling sized potatoes from our backyard garden and fresh herbs along with the coconut oil. So much lighter than the classic brown sugar cinnamons butter that he loves too. I asked him if it was a keeper and he said yes.

Wow.  Way too much rosemary and thyme.  This would be a marvelous recipe if one cut those measurements in half, though.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have any issue with the cooking time.  Perhaps I cut my potatoes smaller and the spices would have been less overpowering if I had cut them larger?

will definitely take much longer than 20 minutes in the oven with a fresh potato.  But if you nuke it first to soften the center a bit, you will have great and speedy results!
