My family loves this recipe!!  The second time I made it, instead of mashing, I grated the carrots, then steamed them in a little bit of water, drained the water then added the other ingredients and baked as directed.

I grew up on Carrot Pudding. I have to tell you, it is REALLY good.  We never ate it for dessert, though. It is one of the staples of our Holiday Dinners as a vegitable dish.  I have now brought it to my husbands family, and they love it.

This recipe was okay.  I don't think that I boiled the carrots for long enough because they didn't mash smooth enough.  I'd recommend cutting the carrots into very small pieces before boiling them.  The boiling takes a long time (I think I boiled them for at least 45 minutes).

Yum, tasty!  Warning, though, this is NOT 12 servings.  It was so good, 4 of us finished off the whole thing.

I make this as a sweet side dish (kugel for shabbat). I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup - and it is still sweet! I like the brite orange collor it has and that there is a low amount of flour in it - making it into a dense pudding and not more cake-like.

very nice, just very carroty.  I think it could do with something to give it a bit more flavour than just carrot.

I guess if I think dessert and pudding this would be good.  I was hoping to use it as a sweet side dish - my mistake.  It is very sweet and mine came out kind of mushy - but if it is truly a pudding, I guess that is how it should be.  Would not make it again.

Really good!  I was expecting more of a pudding, but it was like baked yams.  I added just a touch of ground cloves.  YUMMY!!  I need to make this for the next holiday!!!!

The flavor was very disappointing.  If it had butter or margarine in it, it would have a more complete flavor.

I found the prep time to be inaccurate. 

I cut the recipe about in half (two and a half cups of mashed, steamed carrots, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 2 Tbsp of flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp vanilla). I suppose I could have used a bit more baking power and vanilla. And I used less sugar than the original recipe called for, but that was intentional.

I like the flavor. I like the texture. I like the sweetness level that I ended up with. But I thought the recipe was an awful lot of work. And, with all the prep time, it took over twice as long as it says.

If I make the recipe again, I'll use a food processor rather than an electric mixer. And I'll probably separate the eggs, beat the egg whites until stiff, and fold them in to help the pudding "puff" more.

My dad has made this recipe growing up the old fashioned way (Colonial Williamsburg recipe), but it takes quite a while. This recipe is perfect. I add orange juice and walnuts and cook it in a bundt pan. It also gives it a better presentation. Delicious!

I've been looking for a good recipe for a wet carrot cake for years and this it. Given how few other ingredients this takes, I was afraid it might taste too carroty, but it doesn't. I just added a pinch of salt and cloves while boiling the carrots. The only remark I have is that I made only half the recipe and it stayed in the oven for close to 50 mins and it's not over cooked. Also, don't forget to line your oven pan; my pudding tasted great but certainly didn't look as good.

I probably did something wrong, but this was basically sugar and soggy carrots.

Edit:  To me, this tasted so much better once some of the moisture evaporated, and after it was chilled.  The flavors really came through, but I don't see a recommendation to chill in the instructions.  Basically, a pound of carrots were gone in one day, thanks to this recipe.  I'd say yum!

Surprisingly good!  I made a half recipe, which was more than enough for my family of three.  I followed the recipe for the test run, though I can see where pumpkin pie spices would be a wonderful addition  I think the basic recipe will lend itself to variations my family will enjoy.  I will definitely be making this again.
