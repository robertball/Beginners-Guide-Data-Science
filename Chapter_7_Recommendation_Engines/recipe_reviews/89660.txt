The basic idea here is a fantastic twist on your ordinary bechamel. The feta is a unique touch.

I didn't have leeks, so I used a red onion. Next time I'll probably head out to the store and find some leeks or green onions, or half the onion.

It wasn't clear in the instructions, but with the amount of flour, I used the bacon fat with a reduced amount of butter for my roux. It lent a nice, smokey flavor throughout the sauce. I also used an extra cup of milk based on the reviews saying it was such a thick sauce. It was still very thick. I also didn't have quite enough feta, so I added a handful of freshly grated parmesan cheese to compensate. Instead of adding the onion and bacon back to the sauce, I reserved it as a garnish. I served the sauce over pasta with blanched green beans and a grape tomato dice. It was a very tasty and filling meal.

Lovely recipe - I'm enjoying it as I type - I added some fresh thyme to break up the rich flavours - this will be a often repeated recipe

This was really really good, although I used cheddar cheese and onions instead of feta and leeks. Very tasty.

We really liked this. I added a generous splash of dry white wine and used ground white pepper instead of black. Makes an easy, elegant pasta sauce that's a keeper.

*Wonderful* flavor and easy to make. I did use green onions instead of leeks ('cause that's what I had). It's a thick sauce, so I would serve over penne pasta ... got reviews of "It's a keeper" from my partner and my sales manager.

Needs work.  Sauce is very pasty & thick as is and the flavor is just bland.  Tastes "canned". Not sure I would make this again, too many additions/changes needed.  Hubby disliked it & my kids wouldn't touch it though they like both feta & Bacon normally.

I thought this was great! I paired it with oven breaded chicken breasts and for the sauce I substituted the leeks for mushrooms. I also added the spicing (pepper and vegeta) while the mushrooms and onions were on the pan (with a little butter!) Turned out great with the regular recipe and considering I read some reviews that said it was too bland, I found that it tasted great! Totally one for my recipe book! 5 stars

I didn't like the idea of making this with leeks, so I used green onions instead. I had it over angel hair pasta, and, with a thick slice of cheesy garlic bread, this made a great lunch. Thanks!

my hubby loved this sauce.  I followed the recipe except made the roux sauce with the bacon and leeks, once thickened I added the feta and simmered ten minutes.  Will make again!

This came out great.  I did not have leeks so I used onion powder at the end.  I think I will try crumbled goat cheese next time.

After reading other reviews, I added a few things suggested by others such as white pepper and used the bacon fat to start my roux. I used shallots instead of leeks and I also added a clove of garlic. I also sauteed some spinach leaves with the bacon and added thyme (as suggested by someone), and salt to the sauce cause the sauce by itself was chalky as others said. The suace was extremely thick and I was going to add chicken broth, but I didn't have any, so I added water instead to loosen the sauce up. After all of my additions, the sauce was rather tasty. I used this sauce with lightly fried chicken breast over linguine. Very tasty. Thanks for giving us something to work with.

Didn't use the bacon because that just sounded gross.... just made it into a cream sauce, was ok but the feta didn't completely melt and hardened quickly...

The flavors in this were very good. Feta is so deliciously sharp and salty, but the bacon gives it a rich smokiness. I disagree with the recipe as written about using all butter and none of the bacon drippings for the sauce part: use as much as you can and add butter if needed, the flavor punch is amazing. I also subbed onion for the veggie as I didn't want to run to the store. A great combo of flavors for a unique pasta sauce, thanks very much for sharing.

this might be better with mayo mixed in with it...it would make it richer and a bit creamier...just a thought. :)

This was really quite tasty!   I used green onions instead of leeks and low-fat milk and cheese. I took some other reviewers' advice and added an additional 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of white wine (yum) and the sauce was definitely thick enough! I did half of the feta and added parmesan to the sauce. I served it over whole wheat fettuccine.   All in all, it was a little richer than I normally prefer, but still really really good. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty! I didn't have and Leeks, so I just left that part out. I really didn't measure anything, just added what I thought would tast good. For the milk, I used half 1%, and half heavy cream to make a nice rich suace. I also added a few glugs of white wine to jazz it up a little. I served it over Garlic Chicken and fettucini. Very rich and tasty!

Loved it! I substituted the milk for almond milk and the butter for Ghee and used 1/4c corn starch instead of flour. It didn't make it too thick, at all, it was just right! I cooked green onions and mushrooms with the bacon. Yummy!

I did not use the butter, but only the drippings from the bacon.  I used only 2Tbs of flour to reduce the thickness of the sauce, based on other reviews.  With this change, I thought the sauce was a perfect thickness.  My family would prefer less cheese, so I will reduce the amount next time.  I agree that this recipe is not pretty, but it tastes great.  We had it over penne.  This is a very quick and easy meal, and gives me more ways to use up the various homemade cheeses I make.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this recipe because I had everything on hand. Husband and daughter loved it and asked that I make it again. I used feta with sundried tomato and basil.

This was fantastic! I left out the leeks since I don't really know anyone who is a real fan and used a tomato basil feta cheese then put it over spinach stuffed ravioli and it was awesome! Definitely making it again!!

It was good, but it needs some work. It is lacking some spices but I don't know which. I added some minced garlic when I cooked the leek and I also added some salt and pepper. I feel it was still missing something.  But overall it is a good idea. I think if you add some oregano, and lemon juice it may taste better. I will try it later.

Well, This didn't actually taste good but I blame my lack of ingredients and scaling the recipe, and not measuring for that! lol  I, however, gave it 5 stars because I can imagine what the proper version tastes like and it makes my mouth water. Will try it again after a shopping trip!  Thanks! Great comfort food right here.

I thought it was very good, I used double the Bacon and I still felt it was a little too "Feta-ie". We served on Whole Wheat Bowtie - Will definitely cook again!

This recipe was delicious! Our first time cooking with leeks--and a success! We changed the cream sauce (1/2 the cheese) and we used turkey bacon instead of real. The sauce was great but we aren't so sure about the T-bacon. We might leave it out entirely next time, as the leeks were soo good. YUMMY definitely a keeper.

This was ok - I tasted the flour and I always seem to taste it when I mix the flour and milk together and just add it to the butter - I prefer making a roux and then add the cheese, etc.  The combination of the feta and bacon we nice.

This recipe was good, but super-salty. We used green onions instead of leeks, and they worked fine. Will make again.

This is an excellent creamy pasta sauce. It's so easy to make and so flavorful! I added peppered bacon which complimented the sauce perfectly, and then served it over linguini.
