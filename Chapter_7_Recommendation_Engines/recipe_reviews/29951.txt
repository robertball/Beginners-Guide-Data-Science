Please don't forget those seeds, when you cut the squash in half spread the seeds out on a piece of foil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, paprika onion and garlic powder and bake them along with the squash anbd in 5 minutes you'll have a little snack wile you're cooking the rest of your meal...they go great with an ice cold beer too!

I loved the hint of orange taste and the easy preparation of this dish; however, I had to fill the hole with something so I diced two macintosh apples and tossed them with the orange sauce and then placed them in the squash.  I cut the baking time of the sqash to 30 min and then baked the squash and apples together for 30 min.  Everyone loved it.

This was really tasty.  I didn't have OJ concentrate so I just used regular OJ.  I cut the cooking time down by partially cooking the squash in the microwave and then finishing it up in the oven with chicken that I was baking.This would be a great holiday recipe.

This recipe was very good but very sweet.  I found adding soy sauce balanced out the sweet with a salty taste.  I will definitely make this again!

I completely enjoyed this recipe. It is an ingenious idea way to get squash past your kid's plate. It worked. I did combine two recipes, however. This one and "Acorn Squash with Apple". So I peeled and sliced the squash and simmered it with apple and the orange sauce. Great job!

Everyone loved it!  Personally, I thought it had too much nutmeg, but I will definitely make it again, but I'll use 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg instead of 1 teaspoon.  Try it!

Should add orange peel to punch up flavoring.  When reheated and mashed with butter and brown sugar is really yummy.

I was so looking forward to this based on the ratings but to be honest, the orange was overpowering.  Did not enjoy it at all.

OK.  I used honey instead of brown sugar. Maybe that's why mine wasn't great. Also I had to cook my squash for more than an hour in a gas oven and they still weren't very tender.

This was my first time making any king of winter squash, It turned out totally wonderful! I used a sweet dumpling squash instead of the acorn squash, and used regular orange juice. I filled the squash with the sauce mix and after the squash finished backing, I reduced the sauce over low heat, and then drizzled it over the squash. It was totally wonderful!

Very good and easy.  Instead of concentrated orange juice I used 1 cup of freshly squeezed OJ, reduced it down to 1/4 cup, added the butter and the rest of the ingredients for the sauce and it turned out much more flavorful.

Easy and very good.  I used a little orange juice rather than frozen because that's what I had.  Adds just enough extra flavors to make the squash a special side dish.

I made this both the way as written and then with my modifications.  As written it is good, not great and as another reviewer stated, the orange is overpowering and they were slightly under cooked.  But nontheless I wanted to try it again my way as it had potential.  First I baked the squashes at 400 for 45 minutes face down and brushed with a smidge of olive oil around the edges.  Second I halved the orange concentrate and upped the butter by a tablespoon.  Also added a 1/2 teaspoon more of brown sugar.  And added chopped peeled empire apples to the centers (another reviewer had suggested that).  Cooked for another 20 minutes and done.  The apples will not be soft or like the consistency of apple pie apples but they add something.

I made this recipe exactly as described except I added thin slices of a granny smith apple to the orange/sugar mixture. The tangy orange, butter, sweet sugar and tangy apples made this acorn squash to so yummy! Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! I used non fat greek yogurt instead of butter, and substituted the brown sugar for stevia in the raw sweetener, and used one organic orange. Turned out awesome!

I thought the orange was over powering. I had it without the orange juice and it was delicious. I know that defeats the recipe, but for me, the orange juice overpowered the squash.

Delicious - the citrus of OJ and the sweetness of the squash and sugar create a great balance. I used fresh OJ, instead of concentrate and it worked out fine.

This is similar to how I usually make acorn squash. Since I mash everything together in the end I do not mix the ingredients up separately before pouring it into the well (one less dish to clean). I just pour regular orange juice (not concentrate) right into the well then add a piece of butter, sprinkle in the brown sugar and the spice (I prefer just cinnamon). Give it a slight swirl with a chopstick and cook until soft. Pour off the liquid into a bowl, scoop out the flesh and mash together.

The taste of orange was too overpowering in this dish. The squash was cooked perfectly, but it's flavor was completely overwhelmed by the orange juice. I will not be making this again.

Delicious, and so easy!  Even my picky 3 year old liked it.  This was very sweet, but the orange flavour was not overpowering.  Am going ot try stuffing the sqash next time with garbanzo beans, carrots, celery, and onion, and we'll see what happens.

I added orange zest and used fresh-squeezed orange juice.  I eye-balled all the other ingredients.  The butter is DELICIOUS!!  I'm going to try it on a toasted bagel in the AM.

I precooked the squash halves the day before.  And followed this recipe except used fresh squeezed orange and also laid some orange slices over the squash.  I also cut the squash into wedges before baking and adding the orange sauce!  Fabulous!

The flavor of the glaze is good. I did not care for the interior of the squash where the glaze didn't get soaked up. (maybe I"m not an acorn squash fan, but a "glaze" fan ;-)  Next time I would scoop out the squash and mix the glaze into the mixture like a casserole.

I wish I could give this 5 stars but to my OWN ERROR I miss read the ingredients and put a WHOLE can of frozen orange juice in it !!! LOL So what I ended up doing was scooping out the squash & draining some of the excess Orange juice and then I put it all in a pie shell and baked it AGAIN - I guess you could call it a Twice baked Orange Acorn Squash Pie - LOL but it turned out really nice - the kids ate it up and though it was a little tangy - I know that was due to my own fault - I want to TRY this recipe again but this time without dumping a whole can of frozen orange juice in it before I realized that I had made a huge Uh-Oh - LOL  But if anything if anyone else ends up making the same mistake I did - at least there is a way to salvage it - just drain out some of the juice and turn it into a pie - haha

I am not a huge fan of acorn squash, but wanted something different to  make for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved this glaze!

I liked this, but my family was not too impressed.  I served this with couscous and added some squash marinade to tie the flavors together.  That was great!This would be good with some curry powder, plain yogurt and sauteed onions.

Don't say no until you know. This is a wonderful side dish served with pork or chicken.
