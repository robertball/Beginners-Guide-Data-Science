On a whim I decided to cook vegetable soup. Having never made vegetable soup, I was a little leery especially since my husband is hard to please.

Success!  

Not only is this easy but it is also tasty and made my house smell awesome!

For the amount of effort, this was fabulous.  I didn't worry about cooking things ahead since everything softened during the simmering.  I brought things to a boil after loading the pot, then turned down to a simmer.  I used fresh green beans and frozen corn.  I also used white potatoes which worked fine.  Red are firmer over time, but this didn't last long.  Could add some canned tomatoes next time perhaps.

Great base for soup! I added a few extras like zukini, celery, and diced tomatoes. The whole family enjoyed it.

This recipe was great!  I was skeptical because it was so simple, and I'm used to seeing recipes that use several different spices, etc., but it was fabulous as is.  I didn't put any corn in because it seemed out of place, and the potatoes took a little longer to get tender than the recipe says.  I used canned green beans and they worked fine.  It's nice to have a recipe you can throw together and walk away from, and it turns out delicious and filling.  Thanks!

Sunday is "clean out the frig day" and it's sleeting and snowing here-burr cold outside! I had lots of fresh carrots and broccoli to use up. Made this soup with just a few changes in the vegs and cooked in the crock pot all day, it was wonderful! Had my brother for dinner and he loved it my hubby had 3 bowls. Also served hot crusty rolls with it. Will make this again soon. This recipe has lots of possibilites with the vegs.

This was a very good & easy recipe...I love the juice cocktail base.  Also, the red potatoes are important as they are firm & hold up better in soup.  I did add a can of diced garlic tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Great soup!  Easy as can be and the V8 makes it very hearty.  I cheated and used onion powder, some baby carrots and and added extra potatoes (I love them) and it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!

This was simple and incredibly good! 
Used both ground beef and a little leftover chuck roast with dripings, tomato soup, added zucchini, and no potatoes. Yum. On my keep list.

I have made this soup two times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written and found it lacking the flavor that I had expected, thus the four stars. So, the second time, I followed some of the suggestions of the other cooks who have made adaptions, and did the following: I used the zesty V-8, added 1 can of beef broth, 1 drained and rinsed can kidney beans instead of the green beans, and 1 cup of red wine. To achieve the flavor I was hoping for, I seasoned the onions and grated carrots with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I added the beef and used the same seasonings on it (I used ground round), then put three large cloves through a garlic press and added that into the mix. I used sweet canned corn and threw in part of a rind of parmesean cheese. I let the mixture simmer for an hour or so and adjusted the salt and the soup was a BIG hit with my family. They gave the new and improved version 5 stars. As one cook stated in her review, this soup is a good base soup and the sky is the limit for additions that can only improve the taste.

AMAZING RECIPE!!  Some deviations - I used garlic, ground turkey, frozen white corn, 2 small diced portabello mushroom caps, 4 diced roma tomatoes, green onion (for garnish), dried oregano, no green beans, and no salt.  I was tempted to buy the low-sodium version of V8, but since it had more preservatives, I stuck with the fully salted version.  I'm glad I did b/c the soup ended up perfectly seasoned w/o needing any extra salt.  I first browned the garlic and onions with the meat, took it out, and then steamed the potatoes in the juices of the meat for 15 minutes.  I should have added the carrots in at the same time b/c the microwave method left the carrots still a little hard and raw.  The overall soup was delicious... with only two people, we ate almost half the pot in one night!!  The soup tastes complex and hearty, but yet is healthy and easy to make.  No need for additional carbs, as this is a complete meal in itself with the potatoes.

I make this soup often, it is delicious and simple. A few additions/changes that I make are to use beef cubes cut into small pieces instead of ground meat. The meat comes out tender and tasty in the soup and adds more flavor. Also, I add 2 cups of shredded cabbage and sliced celery. I bring this to a boil then simmer 90 minutes.

Just made this last night and it was fabulous!  I added three beef bullion cubes and a healthy seasoning of Tony Cacherie's because we like bolder falvors. Will make again!

A great soup recipe. I did tweak it a tad though. I didn't use vegetable juice, and I added a package of brown gravy mix. I try different things each time I cook it to find a way that best suits my family.

Well for starters it didn't have much flavor and secondly it lacked a lot of vegt. I use 3  beef boullion, 2 to 3 bay leaves, basil, oregano, lil salt, black pepper. For the vegt: potatoes, corn, carrots, tomatoes, baby lima beans, pinto beans, onion, green beans, peas and for the meat; stew beef. Guess everyone has their own preference.

This recipe is a refined version of the stews I ate growing up on a farm in New Zealand.  Now I live in Europe I thought I would give it a twist to better represent my current location. I removed the ground beef and replaced it with Italian Chorizo sausage. And we had it with home made garlic bread on the side.  It was amazing!!!!

While the V8 provides some flavor, I think this recipe needs some additional seasonings. Perhaps a bit of chili powder or cayanne, or a dash of hot sauce, worchestershire sauce, or maybe a little bit of soy sauce would help it. Perhaps a couple of spoonsful of salsa. Basil would certainly be good in it. I like the way this soup is thicker. We prefer thicker soups in our home. Overall a good soup, but with a few tweeks could be a great soup. I wouldn't add salt to it because of the salty V8 in it. Good to put together in a crock pot. There is really no need to use the microwave here. Cook everything altogether. Very easy.

I've made my own version of this for several years now and it's always one my family is happy to eat.  I make mine with half V8 and half beef broth and sometimes add a squirt of tomato paste.  I also add a bit of olive oil and italian seasoning.  I don't add salt because the beef broth already has enough.  I love that this soup is made with stuff I always have on hand anyway!

This soup is DELICIOUS! I was looking for an easy, healthy meal idea and came across this recipe.  The soup is very easy to make and fills you up! The only thing I added was a can of red kidney beans simply because I love them.  I also used the readers suggestions about using the spicy V8 juice.  I highly recommend this soup! I made a batch of cornbread to eat with it. I will definitely be making this soup many more times. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have to say that I always get a kick out of people who rave what a good recipe something is and then proceed to list the 19 changes they made to it.  That said, vegetable soup is one of those things that just seems to lend itself to improvisation by even the most inexperienced cook (which I'm not by a long shot), so all you really need is the different idea.  This ones different idea is the ground beef, instead of the chuck roast I usually use and the tomato juice cocktail.  And that worked out to be a really, really good idea.  I used the hot and spicy V-8 like someone else did which added just the right amount of kick for me.  I also used home canned green beans and way more corn, since I love corn in my veggie soup.  And I added a can of chopped tomato.  But I did follow this recipe closer than I usually do for soup.  Oh and I did just brown the meat, fry the onions and then throw everything else in the pot to cook.  Actually I brought it to a boil and then put it covered in the over at 350 for a few hours.  Turned out great.  I'll definately keep this idea in mind when I make soup again.  I ended up with way more than the recipe, but then soup always does get away from me.

What a very simple and FABULOUS tasting soup! My family all loved it, even my VERY picky daughter! I actually made it in my slow cooker,...browned the ground beef with fresh garlic & onion, added the remaining ingredients and cooked it all day! I chose to use a frozen veggie mix of corn, green beans & carrots.  I also added a couple beef boullion cubes and a can of diced garlic/onion tomoatoes.  The flavor was really, really good! Highly recommend!

It is dumping snow outside and this hit the spot!  My family despises canned tomatoes so it was refreshing to see a vegetable soup without them.  Easy and delicious! Thank you!

Very good and healthy. I used sliced fresh green beans and Trader Joe's vegetable juice, but next time I will use straight tomato juice. Tastes great the next day and I froze leftovers.

I just made this soup for lunch.  I did not have V8 juice so I did take the advice of another reviewer and used I can of tomato soup, I also added 1 pkg. of dry vegetable soup mix with 3 cans of water.  Also, added celery and cabbage because I had them and needed to be used.  This soup was excellent, my husband who loved it.  It is a definite keeper.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great base recipe, so just enhance it with, basil, thyme, marjoram and a bay leaf or two.  I just add and taste until I like the results.  A dash of ginger or cinnamon can be good also, but be careful not to get to much.

I was turned on to this one because it used ground meat instead of "stew" meat (I am not a chunky meat fan).  I also was looking forward the the V8 base.  I thought it was fantastic!  I used the red potatoes (had never done that in a soup and thought they were better!), onion powder instead of real onions, and frozen mixed vegetables instead of the vegetables listed here.  Thanks for sharing this - it's one to keep!

So easy! Hubs even commented how good it was! I must admit, I cheated and added 3 cups of frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned and carrots. Pulled this together in a "minute" for an easy, yummy meal. Thanks!

Tried the recipe exactly as written and found it to be very bland.  Took suggestion of other reviews and added some basil and oregano.  Also added some garlic salt and 4 beef bouillon squares.  With these modifications, turned out very good and the whole family liked.

This recipe makes a good base for soup.  It was pretty good, although I wouldn't say it was a FLAVORFUL dish.  My husband liked it.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and used 2 lbs instead of 1 (for that many potatoes and carrots, it didn't seem balanced to only use 1 lb of meat).  I also added a can of diced tomatoes.

I doubled it for my food-consuming family. Instead of using all V-8 juice, I used a can of V-8 as well as a can of tomato. I didn't put the water in. Delicious!

I was pleasantly surprised that this soups turned out so delicious.  It was so easy.  I sauteed the beef and some chopped onion first, and then added frozen mixed vegetables in place of the carrots and canned corn.  I added the potato when I added the vegetables.  I also covered the soup as it simmered.

I received this recipe in the daily dish yesterday.  I stopped on my way home and got the ingredients and had this last night for dinner.  It was awesome.  I added two cloves of minced garlic and omitted the salt.  Instead of cooking the carrots in the microwave, I cooked them with the potatoes, hamburger and onion mixture.  I added the 1/2 cup of water to that to help steam the veggies.  I also added some red pepper flakes in the end because I like a little spice.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!!

Easy and Tasty vegetable beef soup.  I browned the beef in a separate skillet before adding to the onion and potatoes.  I also added some celery salt, garlic salt and parsley for a bit of added flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

Hearty delicious soup, I made it almost exactly like the recipe only I used fresh zuchinni and threw in a chicken boulion cube.   We topped it with cheese.  Next time I'll try adding stewed tomatoes and green chilis for an extra kick

Five stars for an easy, tasty soup perfect for weekend lunches.  Used Hot V8, which gave this great flavor.  Used the bag of frozen carrots, corn, and green beans, which simplified the recipe even more.  Also used ground venison because my husband is a hunter, couldn't tell the difference.

I ahve been making this soup for 50+ years and I also add what ever left over vegetables I have along with some tomatoes and  okra. t is so easy and I usually make enough to freeze for a day when I don't have the time to cook or on the spare of the moment meal. I quite often make the ground beef into small meat balls instead. Add a few fresh herbs and it is to die for.

My mother used to make this soup, especially for my brother who didn't like vegetables.  She didn't add  potatoes.  After the recipe was completed cooking she blended the finished product.  It was delicious!  The entire family loved it and everyone got their vegetables. She served it with fresh loaf bread from the  Polish bakery.

Absolutely one of the best soups I've ever tasted.  My husband and I loved it and ate the leftovers every day until it was gone!  Soooo easy - didn't change a thing!  Thank you!

This was a great, easy weeknight soup.  I altered slightly.  I browned the beef, then drained in a colander.  While the beef was draining, I sauteed the onion and sliced carrots, then added 2 cloves of garlic.  I then added all ingredients, adding one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and omitting the potatoes.  I cooked small pasta on the side to mix in the soup when ready.  Next time, I'll try the spicy V-8.  Everyone enjoyed.

Here are the few changes I made:  I used regular brown potatoes instead of red, frozen corn instead of canned and I sauteed the carrots with the potatoes and beef instead of microwaving them seperately.  It turned out delicious.  I would definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this dish.  My husband went back for seconds and that is always a good sign.  I will make again but going to use steak instead.  A keeper!

A good beginning to how I make vegetable beef soup.  I use stew beef, add garlic, add barley, use chopped tomatoes instead of juice, and more water.

My nutritionist told me how to make this years ago. I love it. I usually use ground beef, but sometimes put chicken in it. I start with frozen mixed veggies and add various things depending on what is available. Potatoes, onions, garlic, black eyed peas, field peas, lima beans, butter beans...whatever you like can be thrown in this soup. I like my soup thick, so I cover it with vegetable juice and sometimes add a little water. I'm not much on veggies, but love this.

Yummy! I used a cup of beef broth instead of water, added 2 cloves minced garlic to the onions, beef and potatoes, and about a tsp of italian spice mixture and it was so good! Will make again for sure!

I made this last night for dinner and after reading the reviews made a few slight additions.  I chopped up about 4 cloves of garlic and added that with salt and pepper to the beef/onion mixture.  I used baby carrots chopped since that is what I had on hand.  I also added a beef bouillon cube to 1/2 hot water and added to make it more "soupy".  I also added 1 chopped zuchini and 1 can of diced seasoned tomatoes (with juice).  After reading reviews and doing a taste test I was afraid of it being too bland so I added additional s/p, celery salt, basil, oregeno, garlic salt a tad of chlli powder and a pinch of red pepper flake.  It smelled WONDERFUL.  The taste was good also, but I'm more eager to eat leftovers today for lunch as I am sure they will be even better.  My 3 yr old daughter ate 3 bowls of it!

Wonderful recipe.  My husband and  one of my children loved it.  I did add some extra vegetables, peas and lima beans.  And I added about a cup of cooked sausage as well, which gave it a bit of extra flavor.  It's not my grandma's, but it's pretty darn close.

My family is a fan of garlic - so I flavored with a bit of garlic salt!!  As others noted - this soup gets even better after a night in the fridge!!  The family loved it on night 1 & still loving it on day 3...

I LOVE this soup!  I've never made homemade vegetable soup so looked through several recipes.  After reading all the good reviews tried it myself.  The key is the tomato juice!  It really makes this awesome.  I used the spicy low sodium V8 variety and had two big bowls.  O M Gosh I'm stuffed and have enough leftover for several lunches this week.  Woooohoooo!!  On a side note I cheated.  I bought the vegetable soup frozen mix that has potatoes, carrots, celery, onions, green beans, tomatoes and okra.  Added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I don't ever add salt but added a touch of garlic powder and some cayenne.  It's a personal choice.  This I will make again!  :-)

i am giving this 4 stars simply because it is a great base recipe. and this novice cook had a fun time jazzing it up a little! I seasoned the ground beef, onion and potatoes with salt, pepper and a few dashes of garlic powder. when I make this again, I will brown the ground beef before adding the potatoes to achieve better browning and avoid over-crowding the pan. to the soup I added I can of garlic diced tomatoes (as suggested by other reviewers), 4 beef bullion cubes, ¼ tsp of cayenne pepper, 3/8 tsp of thyme and 2 bay leaves. and again, this is a great base recipe to learn to use spices and herbs to your tastes. I served this with a semi-homemade cornbread and it was delicious!! thank you, STKA for this recipe!

this recipe is perfect!!!  i used stew beef instead b/c it's what i had but kept all ingredients per recipe. it is delicious, esp if you prefer to not use the frozen mixed veggies which most other recipes call for. i cooked my onions and beef down first then put all ingred in crock pot on high for 6 hours. PERFECT!!

I used diced chuck steak instead of ground beef.  Turned out fabulous!  Nice, thick soup with a lot of flavor that is easy and satisfying.  Was planning to add barley but it was too thick and wasn't needed as all the vegetables made it very hearty.

This soup was delicious. Or at least a great base to make my own creation from. :) 
I cooked onions and celery with the ground beef. Added zucchini and garlic with the potatoes. Didn't cook it down all the way. Then put in a bag of frozen mixed veggies when I added the liquid. Also included a few canned diced tomatoes and some leftover beef consomme. 
Simmered for an hour to let flavors meld and make sure the potatoes were cooked.
Served with crusty french bread.

One of my favorites!!  I used two cans of green beans instead of frozen and add 1 to 1/2 cups frozen BABY lima beans cooked. I may add some garlic cloves next for a change but this is really good!

This was wonderful!  I love the idea of using v8 juice in soup...never even crossed my mind.  VERY good.  The only thing I changed was added some extra chili powder, pepper and garlic powder for some seasoning.  Will be saving this one!

This was very good.  I felt as if something was missing.  I didn't use V8.  I used a "off brand" which probably was the difference.  This was very tasty regardless.

I made this for my wife and she loved it.  I used a lot of the canned vegetables from the back of the shelf but the soup turned out well (a solid '4' rating).  I gave the soup a 5 since I didn't use fresh vegetables.

Excellent and easy.  I shredded a zucchini which melted into the soup so my family wouldn't see it.  I also chopped a large bunch of spinach and two handfuls of chopped parsley.  Healthy and filling!

I am making this for the 2nd time tonight.  It was really good.  I have to admit I did make some changes, I don't like to do that the first time I try something, but I know my family and what will work.  I cut the tomato juice with some beef broth and added some ground pork.  We enjoyed it and obviously will make it again!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good soup.  I used frozen mixed vegetables (as was suggested by other reviewers) and also added a can of kidney beans (drained).  It needed more spices than was called for in the recipe, but that was easy to do.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

My husband and I loved this soup. I did take some of the other ideas, added minced garlic, celery, a half of can of stewed tomatoes, instead of water,I used a can of beef broth and also added chopped up cabbage and used spicy V8 juice. I also added a little hot sauce.

The best vegetable beef soup!!  I actually had a bunch of leftover homemade spaghetti meat sauce and meatballs (I did cut those up) that I used instead of the tomato juice.  It worked out PERFECT since it was already made with onion, garlic, green pepper & Italian herbs.  Then I added beef broth and a little water.  Threw in all the vegetables, with the addition of celery and cooked it for about two hours.  WOW!!!

This was a tasty and hearty soup!  For a little extra flavor I added garlic tabasco sauce to taste.  Also, rather than chop and cook the potatoes and carrots I just threw in a couple can already sliced, undrained.  Yummy and easy!

Well, I made some changes but enjoyed this recipe! I made everything in 1 pot (no microwave necessary!). Instead of tomato cocktail, I used jarred tomatoes and 3 cups of broth. Even then, I thought the soup was more of a stew than a soup. But, all in all, a very nutritious soup! Thanks!

Three and three-quarter stars. I was excited about trying this recipe. It was easy to prepare, smelled delicious, and was filling served with cheesy biscuits. Omitted corn and added frozen peas, a quartered & sliced small zucchini, and canned diced tomatoes. But the flavor was ho-hum and rather disappointing. Leftovers, however, were tastier the second day. If I make this again I will add garlic and dried herbs to punch up the taste, and perhaps try the spicy variety of vegetable-tomato juice.

This was an easy recipe to fix, and nice that you can use some of the "leftovers" in the refrigerator and get a great meal!  I added some chili powder to get a little more taste...my family loved it!

DELICIOUS AND VERY EASY!!!
 This recipe makes a big pot of soup. I enjoy leftovers so I néver mind that.  I enjoy a nice hot bowl of soup for lunch or dinner. It is very easy to change ingrédients based on what you have in your pantry or refrigerator. I used about a pound of sirloin steak because I didn't have any hamburger. It turned out gréât and I think lower in fat.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made a double batch for my daughter who just had a baby and is trying to eat whole, healthy foods.  She (and I) LOVED it!  I left out the water and used garlic salt in place of the salt.  Didn't have any vegetable juice cocktail, so I used 50 oz of tomato juice and 4 cans of diced tomatoes blended to make juice.  Super easy and yummy!  I will definitely be making this for hubby and my other kiddos when I get home!

I have made this many times over.  The recipe as written is GREAT. The only thing I do different is I use left over meat loaf in place of the meat . . I just make extra meat loaf and freeze some for making the soup later. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Great staple soup recipe with so much room to customize to your taste. For me and my family, I add 1 pouch Ranch Dressing mix, 2 bay leaves, plus an additional teaspoon of salt. I use frozen corn and fresh green beans. I sauté the onion before adding to the soup.

I used stew meat and cubed it up a little smaller.  I used 1 bag of frozen corn (16oz) instead of can corn.   Used 1.5 cups of water with 1 beef bullion cube. I did not microwave the carrots, and I used spicy tomatoe vegetable juice.  Turned out great.

Love this recipe.  Great for eating on a cold day and taste better the next day.  Feeds several people and you can keep it in the refrigerator for several days.  My family loves it and so do I.  Thanks for reminding me that this was what my Mom used to make to feed 7 kids, years ago. Comfort Food !!!!!

I didn’t use potatoes, as they aren’t part of my diet, and added celery & leek. I also added 2tbsp of beef soup base for a heartier flavor. It was delicious! I will for sure be making it again!

I rated this a "5" because it is a simple, hearty soup that everyone in my family will eat. It's flavorful enough as-is, but sometimes we add spice or chili sauce. Love it!

Initially, I was weary to cook soup with vegetable juice as I have never done it that way before.. but it was delicious! 
I added a little more onions, pasta shells and beef bouillon and it was just lovely! Very wholesome and hearty :)

This recipe had "great bones" (haha) - I added some additional ingredients to make it my own. I amped up the vegetable content with fresh tomatoes that needed to be used up and the flavor profile with some Tony Chachere's Seasoning and some Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle and  also some fresh garlic with the onions and browning ground beef.  As stated before, this is really tasty considering how easy it is to throw together.

Fairly easy to make and has a nice flavor. I used lean ground beef so there really wasn't any grease to drain (most of it was absorbed by the potatoes). It took me longer to prep the potatoes (cleaning, cutting out eyes and bad spots and dicing) than anything else, but I just may be slow at that.

I made this soup, and it is VERY GOOD! Like others, I added other ingredients to my personal taste. I did add a jar of home-canned tomatoes in juice, Lea & Perrin's Worchestershire Sauce, Bay Leaves, Thyme, Herbs De Province and 2 Tbsp of Real Butter. 
     My mom used to make a similar soup in "hard times." It was very comforting to me. I was going to add some shredded, fresh cabbage, but it is SUPURB without it!!! ;) Thanks so much for sharing!  We will be eating this with Crackers and Margarine Spread! YUMMO!

I love this soup. I have been making it for a few years now. I don't change anything. I may add other veggies that I have one hand. I also make this at the restaurant where I work. The customers love it.

I made this tonight for supper, because we had chuck roast with vegetables (red potatoes, green beans & onions) yesterday for Sunday dinner. I threw out the old cooked onions, diced up an onion, sauteed it and threw it in a pot with the leftover roast, beef broth, potatoes (which I skinned & diced for this dish). I also added our own canned vegetables from the cellar (corn, more green beans, carrots & 1 small jar of canned tomatoes).  I added the rest of the ingredients called for & brought to a boil, then simmered for an hour & 1/2. This was DELICIOUS! Family loved it. We have leftovers to freeze. **Note: I did add 2 & 1/2 cups of beef broth, since i had extra ingredients in. It was perfect.

Easy, healthy, economical, and tastes good.  What more can you ask for. I used V8 juice and cubed the potatoes.  If you have a few veggie you need to use up, throw them in the pot.

It was easy and good. I didn't like the ground beef in it as I felt it was bland, no flavor. Next time I may use stew beef or add spices to the ground beef.

I used a dicer to make it easier and more uniform chunks, my family loved it.. Even the hard to please one had 3 bowls two days in a row! I did a low carb version and added diced tomato, no potato and substituted jicama for the potato and added shredded cheese
On top.. Both were amazing although I wouldn't mind trying zucchini and bell pepper too. Oh I also used
No sodium canned items, low sodium vegetable juice and added my own sea salt and mrs dash to make it low sodium and heart healthy:)

This was my first soup that wasn't from a can. I had to modify some things because I made it for the cafe I work for. We will see what the customers think tomorrow :) I added some herbs and lots of dried peppers and it is delicious!

I liked this, but it could be improved on.
I made it pretty much as written, using 85% lean ground beef, a yellow onion, and a slightly larger can of corn (15.25 ounces). I found that in my case, the cooking times needed to be longer, for cooking "until beef is no longer pink and potatoes are tender". This makes a lot of soup, and it's probably pretty healthy with all the vegetables and vegetable juice, but I thought it was maybe too chunky, and perhaps additional spices or herbs could jazz it up. Still worth making, though!

This was a surprisingly good soup.  My husband and I loved it ... and it will be even better tomorrow!    Using what was on hand, I did sub 2 bags of GG frozen Mixed Veggies for the carrots, corn, and green beans.  I also had a few thin cut soup bones on hand, so I browned them and added them for more depth of flavor.  The V-8 juice was a wonderful base for this soup.

This was a really easy soup to make, and very tasty. Instead of adding fresh vegetables, I added two cans of No Salt Added Veg All to save time. This makes a lot of soup, so I will be freezing some of it for a quick meal on a cold night.

This was great! My husband, who doesn't normally care for soup, ate it cold for lunch!! I used rice as the starch instead of potatoes because I didn't have any, and that was just fine.

Hubby liked it and the kids thought it was alright. It fed a family of five with pleanty left over. I froze the rest, i'm not sure how it will taste once thawed. I recommend using the spicy V8.

Very good, made in crock pot, let it cook on low for 8 hours, very easy.  Average flavor, could add additional spice to make this a stand out.

VERY yummmy!  Made quite a bit so may try to cut it in 1/2 next time (just me and the hubs).  I DO NOT like V8 but gave it a try and it really did make a yummy (not too greasy) broth.  I added my own favorite veggies...but otherwise followed recipe to the T.  Will definitely make again!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because everyone in my house thought it was good and said they wanted me to make it again...and that happens rarely. I used ground turkey instead of beef and added celery and garlic and a little thyme. It was very tasty and got better each time we heated it up for leftovers.

I decided to make this recipe, but threw everything in the crock pot on a chilly Saturday....wanted it to cook all day.  I added a few more spices and everyone agreed it was a keeper.  I think this is a good base that you can "tweak" any way you want.

Yummy soup and sooo easy and quick to make!  I browned the hamburger 1st, drained it and then lifted the remains with about a cup of sherry. Cooked it down and set aside. I softened the onions and potatoes with a can of vegetable broth. Then added 32 oz. bottle of tomato cocktail and made up the difference with some Spicy V8. Added all other ingredients, including lifted hamburger. Very, very tasty!

Great soup!  The only thing that I did differently was to add the chopped carrots to the hamburger, onion, potato mixture and sauteed.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good and easy. I made a few changes. Omitted the potatoes. Cooked ground beef, onion, and carrot in a dutch oven. The beef was lean and I didn't need to drain it. Omitted the water. Used 1 can low sodium beef broth instead. Prepared the rest as written. Added 2 handfuls of Ditalini pasta. Delicious!  My husband had 2 large bowls for dinner!

Great recipe! I used leftover corned beef, carrots and potatoes from my sunday roast, throught it all into the slow cooker and had a beautifully flavoured soup waiting for us when we got home from a long day of pond hockey. Thanks a bunch!!!! Perfect recipe for left overs!

My kids LOVE this! I make it pretty much as directed but I just dice the potatoes and put them in the pot instead of cooking with the beef and I just steam the carrots.  Its so easy and Tasty.

A very simple soup, I made this in my crock pot I used a large package of mixed vegetables instead of the potatoes, carrots, corn, and beans, the last half hour I put in a handful of pasta.  Don't know if I will make again.

This soup was so simple & suprisingly so yummy! I wasn't sure about cooking the potatoes in with the raw ground beef & onion but it all cooked nicely! I also thought it might be really bland & it kinda was. So to the 1 cup of water I added 2 beef bullion cubes. Then to the whole pot I added extra salt, extra pepper & a tablespoon or two of Worchestershire sauce. This made the broth really flavorful & yummy! What a great soup for those cold winter days!

This is a good soup. I did like other reviewers and used beef broth instead of water and added half cup of red wine. I used 5 fresh tomatoes diced up instead of the tomatoe paste and canned tomatoes. You can make this with just about any ingrediants and not go wrong.

We thought this soup was very tasty, if a tad bland.  Next time I would add some herbs and perhaps a little chili powder.  I made it as written, but added a couple cloves of garlic, a zucchini and a splash of worcestershire.  I sauteed the beef/onion/garlic together, then removed the meat mixture and steamed the potatoes/carrots in the pan for 15 minutes before combining everything.
