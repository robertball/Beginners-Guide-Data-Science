Followed the directions to the letter, and found the sauce to be a little diluted and bland.  I added more balsamic and let it reduce which helped intensify the flavor, but I was expecting more from the sauce (and my plums were perfectly ripe and tasty).  I'm wondering if mashing one of the plum wedges into the sauce or perhaps adding more thyme to it would add more flavor? You may want to start checking the pork temperature well before 20 minutes, because mine reached 145 degrees F at about 12 minutes (oven temps do vary).  We enjoyed it, it was very moist and tender, and I definitely will make this again, but I will concentrate on improving the sauce (personal taste preference, I suppose).

Great recipe! My family loved it.  Only issue I see with the recipe itself is that it never tells you to put the pan in the oven.  Had I not watched the video I would have never known.

I have made this recipe many times.  I also add more Balsamic to my sauce.  I use a larger tenderloin and add more fruit.  I have also made it with Apples, fantastic.  Love it and it freezes well.

I doubled the recipe with 2 Granny Smith apples instead of the plums since it's what I had on hand and then followed the recipe - it was delicious!!

I used a small boneless pork roast because it was less expensive than pork loin, 3 Tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, 2 tablespoons of butter and chicken stock instead of water. It was completely delicious.

Excellent.  Very easy and company worthy.  I made it as written with the addition of an extra plum and extra Tablespoon of Balsamic vinegar.  I tend to over cook things so I was glad for the information in the video about going by the meat thermometer and expecting the meat to be a little pink.  The meat was very juicy and tender.

Completely delectable dish which uses simple, fresh ingredients. The only change I made was to use yellow cooking onions in place of the onion and shallots. The plums are so good that next time, I will probably throw an extra one or two in the pan. I was tempted to use chicken broth in place of the water but it really isn't needed with the pan drippings, balsamic, caramelized onions and plum juices providing all the flavouring needed. Just be sure to season with salt and pepper after tasting and be sure to take the time to fully reduce the sauce and to allow the onions to caramelize to ensure maximum flavour. Thanks, Chef John! I'll be making this one regularly and can see experimenting with different fruits and/or herbs, depending upon what's in season or on hand.

I thought it was great. I have smoked pork with plum wood so I knew it was good, plum and pork are really good together I think.

I used white plums that are in season right now.  Definitely use plums that are firm.  Mine were a bit over ripe, but very sweet.  I used centre cut pork loin because that is what I had on hand.  The recipe is perfect as it is.

It was delicious and beautiful. The only thing I added was a little red wine to the caramelized onions which was fantastic.  Next time I might even try Port instead of red wine.   I think the sweetness from the Port would be a great compliment to the pork.

Delicious just the way it is written!  I love the combination of onion and fruit.
I made it with a pork loin roast, I think next time I'll try it with the tenderloin.  It will probably be a more elegant presentation.

This turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe with one change up.  I had a bottle of balsamic reduction in the fridge so I used that instead of reducing step.  Either way it was good and a recipe that I will make again!

Delicious!!  Added 1 extra tablespoon of Balsamic as other suggested and extra thyme.  Roasted the meat for 14 minutes.  
I will make this again and add more onion and shallot because I love them.

I made this using butterfly cut pork chops. We were delighted with the dish and will make it again and again! The sauce was delicious, after it reduced by half for perfect consistency.

This was OUTSTANDING. I followed the recipe as written (with the exception of using balsamic glaze and adding mushrooms) and it turned out tremendously. 

Definitely watch the video as itâ€™s a step by step AND  baked the tenderloin in the cast iron skillet I used to prep the ingredients. 

Excellent and makes you look like a gourmet. Will make again

Noticed that other reviews found sauce bland, so I added a tsp of dijon mustard and more fruit. Still pretty bland. Next time, I will sub dry vermouth for half the water. Good concept, comes together as recipe suggests. Just needs tweaking.
The second time, I added a tablespoon of housing sauce, subbed dry vermouth for half the water, and added more fruit. Now it deserves 5 stars!

Not what I was expecting. It made the pork taste more like beef.  I don't think I would make it again.

The pork tenderloin was super tender and the black plums were beautiful.  I like how the pork turned out, but did not care for the sauce, as it basically tasted like sauteed onions. While I would cook the pork this way again, I wouldn't make this recipe (sauce) again.

Getting my hubs to eat a pork tenderloin is next to impossible but he really liked this! It's a Win for this dish. 
I did have to substitute the plums for nectarines because my local store didn't have plums. The other change I made was just adding more balsamic because my hubs loves it and I was trying to win him over. :)  To make this feel like a hearty meal (I'm carb cutting), I  also made some mashed rutabaga on the side. Hubs loved all the onions and juice over the mash and I noticed he was scooping it along with the bit of pork and onion.

My family and I loved this recipe! However, I would never have known to put it in the oven without watching the video.

I had grilled marinated tenderloin for a previous meal and wanted a sauce for the left-overs. So I followed this recipe but excluded all steps associated with the pork. I sauteed the onions in oil with the quartered plums for the time suggested, put it away in the fridge for a day, and then double wrapped it in tin foil with the 7 sprigs of thyme (I adjusted the recipe for 4) and placed on the grill at indirect medium heat for 35 minutes. I heated up a small amount of veg oil and transferred the sauce, quartered plums and all, to the oily skillet, added 1 1/2 C of water (less than called for), 4 TBL of balsamic vinegar (more than called for) and boiled on med-med high heat for about 7 minutes. I added a small mixture of flour and warm water to thicken it up just because I was impatient. It was great on the left over pork, which I heated up on the grill right before serving.  I forgot the butter, but I loved the sauce. I am sure it would have tasted even better with the butter! When it is not too hot to turn on my oven, I will try the full recipe!
