Wheneveer I bake cookies, it usually doesn't turn out too well.  But this turned out great, first my family was really skeptical about eating them.  The first taste was a little different to me too.  But after that, they couldnt stop.  And the next morning when I woke up, all 2 dozen of them were gone.  (they loved it with coffee)

Oh my gosh!!! What a hit! these were amazing! I gave them as gifts, and everyone who i gave them to has asked for the recipe! They are so tasty! And easy to make! Being lazy, instead of chopping them up by hand, i just roughly chopped them in a food processor. A little fiddly to shape, but just dump a small amount in a little pile (drop them off a small spoon...dont even try to shape them). I dusted them with some icing sugar at the end, which gave them a special touch! Fantastic, everyone should give them a go!

These cookies were great except that 30 minutes was way to long to set the timer to! At about 12 minutes they were done I believe. I'll make them again for sure and watch the timer better because they ended up a bit burnt :(

Savoury little bites! I actually was too lazy to chop the almonds by hand and put them in our coffee grinder :) and by delicious accident the cookies ended up having a bit of a coffee flavour to them.  Next time i'll try a bit of our flavoured coffee! Great with a touch of cinnamon as well!

These cookies were good beyond belief - had to force myself to save some for the others to eat. Thank you!

these were really nice - easy to make in a rush, and people can't figure out what it's made of!
i would recommend decreasing the amount of sugar, though.  it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  
i used sliced almonds, although next time i would try using ground almonds, to improve the texture.

thanks for the recipe!

These were okay but not great.  Used the recommended amount of sugar, but didn't think they were too sweet.  These can't be classified as almond cookies as I had mistakenly thought of them at first, but more as a sweet nut confection. Don't know if I would make them again unless I'm really wanting an almond fix!

Wonderful and soooo flavorful!!!!!!!!!  I made these cookies for the first time this past Christmas (I forgot to write a review than..).   I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out PERFECT!!!  I made them smaller though, so they were little bite sized pieces so you could just pop them in your mouth.  My family still raves about them!  They are sure to be a Christmas tradition treat from now on. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I've made these several times now thinking I must have done something wrong, and trying to get them to come out right. Don't get me wrong, these taste really good when they come out of the oven. The problem is the texture. They really don't puff up and look the way they do in the picture. They really just end up being piles of chopped nuts help together by a sugary glaze. They totally fall apart when you try to eat them. I have a feeling these would be really great if you ground the almonds down to almost the consistency of flour, but I don't have the patience to try them again to see.
