Made this dish for the first time using Birds Eye Recipe Ready Mushroom Blend instead of the Marsala Blend.  I'm not a fan of onions and the Marsala blend is loaded with them, but the Mushroom blend had a nice assortment of mushrooms all in one package.  The recipe for the Chicken Marsala is really basic and I found that the dish really needed seasoning, especially salt and pepper, but with some minor tweaks it was a quick and easy meal.  I'd try this again for those nights where I don't have time to put together a large dinner.

We had this for dinner tonight.  I added one minced clove of garlic and subbed chicken broth for the beef broth in the recipe due to a pantry surprise--no beef broth!  We enjoyed the flavor, and I liked the ease of preparation.  Do not omit the thyme.  The sauce is too sweet without it.

Made this dish family style by cutting up the chicken. Husband and daughter were pleased and thought the sauce was tasty. I thought it was a little sweet but that might be the type of wine. I liked the combination of vegetables. Quick and easy dish.

The taste was OK, not my favorite chicken marsala, but the Birds Eye vegetable blend had too many chopped onions making for a not-so-appealing presentation.  I lightly dusted the chicken tenders with flour before browning, and I will say it was an easy and quick preparation.  I would have rated this a 3, but my hubby thought the flavor deserved 4 stars.
