These were a hit with our family. The chicken was very good and had no problem with the breading. I pounded the chicken breasts out longer than wide so we could use them on French bread rolls. The coating on the chicken seems quite verstile and I'm am considering using it for other breaded baked foods. The recipe didn't suggest any bread spreads so I offered the old stand-by of different mustards, and mayo and also Olive Aioli, oh, minus the jalapeno. That was by far my favorite. For lunch or a casual dinner, these were great. And the breading?, I'm thinking about using this idea for baked chicken fried steaks sandwich with steak sauce. These were a winner with our family.

My husband and I really enjoyed these. I followed the recipe as is. People have been complaining about the breading falling off; I just made sure I pushed my chicken down into the cornmeal mix very well and that seemed to do the trick. After the chicken was baked I coated it in Franks Red Hot Sauce and used ranch and a lettuce leaf to top it off.. We served them with chips and mac'n'cheese (not very healthy but delicious!!)

I made these and they came out just fine. Made them for a Sunday dinner one week and everybody loved them. Once you bring the chicken out of the buttermilk, dip it in some beaten egg to get the coating to stick better to it.

This is quite tasty.  I've made it twice now.  The first time I cooked it as written (except I didn't plan far enough ahead to marinate the chicken in the butter milk for 8 hours).  It was very good, but I did have issues with the breading falling off.   The second time I made it I dipped the chicken back in the buttermilk after the initial coating and added a second coating of the breading.    It worked much better and the coating stayed on the chicken.  The next time I make it (and there will definitely be a next time) I will try cooking it a bit longer or at a higher temp. to see if I can get the double coating to crisp up a bit more.    This recipe is a keeper for me.

We really liked these.  I used thinly sliced chicken breasts and only put them in buttermilk for about 4 hours.  Kept all ingredients the same except dipped them in egg prior to the coating.  I think the key is to cook them in a few tbsp of oil on the stovetop.  Not as healthy but had the crunch of a restaurant sandwich.  We added Franks Hot sauce to the top as well as bleu cheese.

Meh. These were not for me. If you enjoy Shake N Bake, these will be right up your alley. I don't, so they weren't up mine. :( Other than the obvious, the texture was quite off-putting. Buttermilk certainly tenderizes, but the end result is a very odd textured piece of meat. To ensure that the coating would adhere to my chicken, I double- dipped first in the breading mixture, then in (beaten) egg and then back into the coating. I sprayed each breast lightly with cooking spray to ensure that they'd crisp up in the oven. If I were to follow Gregg's directions (coating only once), I'd barley have a breaded piece of meat! NOTE: If you decide to try this recipe and modify it as I did, you will need DOUBLE the amount of breading mixture called for. I halved this recipe (and the breading / coating ingredients accordingly) and midway thru had to make the rest of the breading mixture because it was all gone after the first dredging! Served on kaiser rolls with lettuce, tomato and mayo and a side of potato salad and carrot / celery sticks with Ranch dip, this was an "OK" meal. My hubby liked these more than I did, but agreed they were not all that great. I won't be making these again (sorry!). Thanks anyways, Gregg. :)

These are very good.  Hubby loved them and so did I.  We ate them without buns, just with roasted potatoes and sliced tomatoes.  We will have these again.

These were awesome. My husband & I both loved them. I forgot to marinate them, and instead of buttermilk, I dipped them in egg as one user suggested. The coating stuck just fine this way. I also didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used sage & herbes de provence, and it was very tasty. I thought this was an especially good recipe because the chicken is baked, not fried, so healthy, tasty & easy!

I did not have any cornmeal so I used bread crumbs instead and it seemed to work out alright!  We had the sandwiches and thought they were pretty good- but the next day we had leftovers and just ate the chicken with melted provolone on the top with sauce and liked it even more!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my family and although the buttermilk added nice flavor and tenderness to the chicken I have to give the breading a thumbs down. It was grainy in places, not crispy at all. I ended up scraping off all of the breading and serving the chicken without it.

The picture for this recipe does not reflect the end product.  It looks like a fried buffalo chicken sandwich.  I think this would be better if it was fried quickly and then baked.  The coating was not crispy at all.

This was ok. Flavor was nice but the coating didn't stick to the chicken. Will use egg and breadcrumb mixture instead.
