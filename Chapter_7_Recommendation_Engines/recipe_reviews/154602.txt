Every Christmas party I attend I am asked to bring this drink. I call it Mulled Wine. The only atleration I made is to put in ground ginger instead of the peels of ginger.

It is the best drink ever! It is a keeper for the rest of my life.

Awesome! I used a box of red wine, no white. Smells wonderful and tastes even better. It tastes just like  the spiced wine at the Christmas markets in Europe. Thanks!

Excellent recipe as is, I also tried a dash of nutmeg for a little more zing which was delicious!

Very nice recipe. BTW - I have prepared this several times with different proportions of red:white wine, and they all turned out interesting. Maybe I just like wine any which way :)

I have quite a few different spiced wine/mulled wine recipes and this one is great. Personally, I like it better than with the honey.  Honey can make the wine too sweet for me.  This is simple and perfect.  I used all red wine though and Grand Marnier instead of brandy.  Great recipe!

This was delicious; everyone at thanksgiving dinner LOVED it! I did the following:

- Put crockpot on low & poured in 2 bottles of sangria & 1 bottle of pinot Grigio.

- Put the orange zest, ½ tsp dried ginger, ¼ tsp ground cloves, ¼ tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cardamom in a coffee filter, tied a string around it & put in crockpot.  

- Juiced 1 orange and filled the rest of the cup with store bought OJ.

- Stirred in a little over ½ cup brown sugar;  Added cinnamon sticks and lemon & orange slices

- Cooked on low for 2 hours & Let people pour brandy into their own cups as desired

This is great for a chilly night.  I had some cherry wine so used that as one of the reds and it worked perfectly.  Like others, I just used crushed ginger (about 1/4 teaspoon) and orange juice (about 1 cup).  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this in a crockpot for my family Christmas dinner. Didn't strain. Looked beautiful & made for great presentation! It was the biggest hit of the day! Having it in a crockpot also allowed for all day use while keeping it the perfect temperature. This will be a staple every Christmas from now on!

Hot Spiced Christmas Wine 
I've made spiced mulled wine for years, and everybody always wants me to make some for them for Christmas to take home. I make mine with Sangria; a red Port; cinnamon; cardomom; nutmeg; cloves; brown sugar; and fresh cut slices of oranges and lemons. I don't use exact measurements, but make it 'to taste'. I can only suggest readers do the same, as not everyone likes the same amount of this or that.

I love mulled wine, but no one else seemed to like it. I've had this many times out, but this was my first time making it. I didn't put in the fresh ginger and was skeptical about the brown sugar, but after trying it, it was a tad bitter. So I added honey. I liked it but my guests didn't seem to drink it.

I made this recipe for my family today for Christmas Eve. They loved it! Though I'm not a wine drinker, I liked it, too. I would recommend adding a dash of nutmeg (no more than 1/4 tsp.), and letting it sit on low heat for 2 or 3 hours, and I added probably close to 3/4 cup brown sugar. It was a very sweet, delicious wine.

I made this wine and added a bit more brown sugar and grand marnier instead of brandy...sadly it came out tasting too much like ginger! If I decide to make it again I am thinking of just cutting the ginger down to only 1 inch piece, and adding more sugar to sweeten the drink up. I don't know what wines everyone used in this recipe, I used Shiraz and Chardonnay, perhaps I should use sweeter wines? I don't know what I did, but the drink is too "tangy."

Yum!! The hit of the party! My modifications were 1/2tsp of ground ginger, Liberty Creek Cabernet 1.5L wine for the red wine $8, and St. Chateau Riesling for the white wine $10.  I am going to keep this stocked all winter long! Love it!!!

This stuff is dangerously good. I used whole cloves and 1/3 c of honey instead of brown sugar, but otherwise kept it the same. I put it in our 3 qt slow cooker on high at about 11 am and it was ready for our guests' arrival at 1 pm. Make sure not to let it cook too long or at least take the cloves out after a few hours, as the they will infuse too much and numb your tongue. Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic!! Four of us had a few servings each, and then it finished. Used a lot more sugar than indicated, almost a whole cup, and used two huge oranges. Since I let it simmer for almost two hours, I had to remove the orange peels from the bottom of the pot-it got a little bitter. Overall very good, a very rich drink.

I loved this recipe.  Just got back from Paris and their Christmas Markets have stands selling mulled wine all over the place.  This was pretty close.  Changes I made....I didn't add the white wine.  Next time I think I will not do ground cloves but will add whole in a cheese cloth so I can extract them.  The ground cloves made the drink gritty.  Overall - everyone that tried it, loved it.  I will make this again.

Delicious and easy. I used ground ginger and cut the recipe in half. We used boxed wine. Next time I think I would use a little less orange zest.

A first-time experience for me, this was a great introduction to hot spice wine.  The next time I make it (and there WILL be a next time!??), I'm going to cut the ginger by a third and add some white sugar to the brown, to balance out the flavors. And I used Slenda brown sugar substitute and it was great - I may do so with the white as well!

I have never made this and I am not much of a wine drinker but my fiance and our friends seem to like it. What type of red wine and white wine... I feel as if this is a simple question but I just do not know anything about wine.
3 Stars because the recipe sounds delicious

I made this for a holiday party a couple of years ago and it was a huge hit!  Sadly I lost the recipe and have been searching for it for years!  I should've known that I had found it here.  Going to make this for a housewarming party next week.  It's a fantastic winter drink!

Awesome!  I think even wine haters would love this one.  I used orange juice instead of oranges and cheap wine from Aldi, a red sangria and a big pink moscato.  No sugar since the wine was sweet and I added spices to our liking.  We simmered it for almost two hours and then added a splash of sprite for bubbly.  Amazing!  Even delicious cold.  I plan on making it at every gathering from here on!

I made this using merlot & Pinot Grigio. I preferred it without the brandy addition which made it too boozy tasting & I found I had to add significantly more brown sugar to remove the bite.

This was excellent!  Made it in my crockpot for our neighborhood Christmas open house. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was to use ground ginger instead of the fresh ginger. Thank you for this recipe. It’s a keeper!

Great and easy recipe. I used white sugar instead of brown and it turned out fine. Next time I’ll try it with brown sugar and I’ll let you know how it turns out.

This was the hit of my holiday party. Tripled the recipe and it disappeared quickly.

A hit at our Christmas. Added a little honey to sweeten it a bit more than recipe-- Friends all commented on how it was like the spiced wine at the Christmas markets in Germany   The slow cooker get it warm all afternoon. Looks like Rainy nailed it. I put all the different spice in a tea ball -- no grittiness.

I've been making this every year to bring to Christmas dinner--it's fantastic! I I don't add the brandy and I prefer to serve it chilled, but it's always a hit!

I made this for a fall girls' night...and was the only one willing to drink it. It became bitter fairly quickly. Will not be making again.

Great recipe, but I must say, I did make a couple changes. I used one bottle of glühwein I got from aldi's, a bottle of sangria, and a bottle of white. I cut the ground cloves to 1/4 tsp, and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. It taste great!

I made this recipe for the first time this past Christmas, and everyone loved it. I used Sweet Red as the red wine and Pinot Grigio as the white. I also added an extra orange to the recipe to give it more of a citrus flavor, and cut up orange slices in it more so for show. This is a recipe I will keep using.

I liked this a lot but my guests did not. I think the brandy was just too much for them. Next time I'll leave it out.
